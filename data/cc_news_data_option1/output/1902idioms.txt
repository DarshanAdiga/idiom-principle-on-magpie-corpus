 LAKE WALES A 32-year-old Avon Park man was arrested after exposing his penis to a woman and masturbating while driving, the Polk County Sheriff's Office reports.
 Justin Mosser of Avon Park faces three counts of indecent exposure in public and two counts of committing a lewd act, all misdemeanors. The PCSO said the charges stem from two separate incidents.
 The first incident occurred on Monday about 8 a.m., when a woman told deputies she was driving on State Road 60 near the Lake Wales Airport and noticed the driver in a gray Mazda next to her was waving and trying to get her attention, according to a PCSO media release issued Thursday.
 The woman told deputies that when she looked over, she saw the man was completely exposed and he began to masturbate.
 The woman called the PCSO and provided a detailed description of the man and gave them photos she took of his car and license plate.
 The PCSO vice squad identified the suspect as Mosser, and on Wednesday morning, did an undercover sting. In the sting, as a female undercover detective drove on U.S. 27 near Pine Crest Road in her unmarked vehicle, a gray Mazda drove alongside her.
 When the detective looked over at the driver, whom they identified as Mosser, he exposed himself, tried to draw her attention to it, then began masturbating, according to reports.
 Detectives pulled the Mazda over for a traffic stop, and he was arrested. According to his arrest affidavit, detectives said he told them he often drives with his penis exposed because he gets hot and \"airs it out,\" and said he has done this sort of thing about four or five times to random women while driving down the road.
 According to the PCSO media release, detectives said he showed no remorse for his actions.
 Sheriff Grady Judd said the PCSO is asking for any women who might have witnessed Mosser's previous occasions to contact the Sheriff's Office.

The novel coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a surge of workplace safety complaints in the mid-Willamette Valley and across Oregon.
 More than 180 such complaints have originated from Linn and Benton counties, according to Oregon Occupational Safety & Health, a division of the Department of Consumer and Business Services.
 Statewide, there have been more than 3,700 COVID-19-related complaints since March, according to an OSHA spreadsheet last updated May 4. “For perspective, in a normal year, on average, we receive just over 2,000 complaints,” said Aaron Corvin, public information officer for Oregon OSHA.
 The mid-valley complaints cover a wide swath of employers, including agricultural businesses, the rare metals industry, high-tech companies, construction firms, car dealerships, convenience stores, restaurants, supermarkets, senior living communities, medical providers, nonprofits and government agencies. Perhaps illustrating how on edge people are, a marijuana business even made the list.

But on the cusp of even more restrictions ending Monday, including gyms cleared to reopen, a political confrontation is growing over attempts by big cities to keep some guardrails. The dispute underscores the gulf between Democrats who run city halls and GOP leaders who call the shots in the capital in Texas, where unlike in other states, the governor's orders supersede all local mandates during the pandemic.
 The renewed tensions come at a moment when Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, warned Congress this week of “needless suffering and death” if the U.S. moves too quickly. Nevertheless, Wisconsin's courts tossed out the state's stay-at-home orders, throwing communities into chaos as some bars opened immediately while strict local restrictions are kept elsewhere.
 In Georgia, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has also expressed unease with the speed that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has reopened the state. Oklahoma lawmakers, irritated by local officials who imposed stricter measures during this health crisis, passed a House bill Thursday that would weaken the power of cities during the next one.
 And in Texas, Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton this week lashed out at the cities of Dallas, Austin and San Antonio over what he called “unlawful" local orders that are tougher than restrictions prescribed by Abbott, and threatened lawsuits if the cities don't back off. The warning came one day after El Paso pleaded to postpone easing up on any more lockdown measures in light of the number of COVID-19 cases there surging 60 percent over the past two weeks.
 “Unfortunately, a few Texas counties and cities seem to have confused recommendations with requirements and have grossly exceeded state law to impose their own will on private citizens and businesses," Paxton said.
 City leaders said their local orders, which include more stringent emphasis on face coverings in public and restaurant protocols that aren't strictly enforced, don't conflict. El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said he made his case to the governor in a phone call, asking for a few more weeks to assess data and reduce cases before more restrictions are lifted, but believes he won't get an answer until Abbott's public announcement Monday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lashed out Thursday at Trump administration officials and congressional Republicans seeking to slow work on a fresh round of coronavirus relief. The White House responded minutes later with a threat that President Donald Trump would veto the $3 trillion economic package Democrats have proposed.
 The bill already had zero chance of passing the GOP-controlled Senate and reaching Trump, making the veto threat a symbolic gesture. Along with caustic criticism by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the exchange underscored the deep election-year gulch over what Congress' next response to the crisis should be.
 But Pelosi's proposal served as an opening move and is likely to eventually produce negotiations among congressional leaders and the White House.
 At a Capitol news conference, Pelosi, D-Calif., lambasted Republicans who've said they want to hold off for now on more relief spending. "It's amazing to me how much patience and how much tolerance someone can have for the pain of others," she said.
 Pelosi told reporters she believed both parties "and even down Pennsylvania Avenue" — a reference to the White House — understand "the hardships Americans are feeling." She called the Democratic proposal "our offer" and said while she's had no recent negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the administration's chief bargainer, "I'm sure that they'll come with something."
 White House officials quickly released a statement of their own. It said the legislation Pelosi unveiled Tuesday is "more concerned with delivering on longstanding partisan and ideological wishlists than with enhancing the ability of our Nation to deal with the public health and economic challenges we face."
 McConnell said later Thursday on Fox News that there was a "high likelihood" Congress would do another bill and said it would include GOP-sought language limiting legal liability for companies reopening for business. He added, "But it's not going to be a $3 trillion left-wing wish."
 The Democratic bill would provide nearly $1 trillion to help financially struggling state and local governments, e xtend special unemployment benefits and direct payments to individuals, and bolster spending for health care programs and essential workers.
 The House on Friday plans to approve the measure, which would be Congress' fifth and largest bill aimed at nursing the teetering economy through the coronavirus crisis. The measure is likely to pass on a near-party line vote and eventually lead to negotiations.
 Objections listed by the White House and McConnell included provisions rolling back GOP-passed tax increases on residents of states with high taxes and making it easier for people to vote by mail and for immigrants in the U.S. illegally to receive some federal assistance.
 The White House criticized $25 billion in aid for the struggling Postal Service, a favorite Trump target. McConnell singled out what he called "the cherry on top" — provisions helping legal marijuana businesses.
 Congress has approved nearly $3 trillion in recent weeks to address the country's twin economic and health crises, including money for coronavirus testing.
 Republicans have expressed worries about burgeoning budget deficits and said lawmakers should evaluate how the initial dollars are being spent before moving fresh legislation. They also want to see whether the economy begins to recover as some states begin easing restrictions that have kept many businesses shuttered.
 Friday's House vote will come as 36 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits since the virus hit the U.S.. In addition, 1.4 million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of the virus and more than 85,000 have died.
 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said a painful, prolonged recession could take hold unless Congress provides fresh aid to bolster the all-but- dormant economy.
 Trump's views on what to do next have been unclear. He's pushed for a reduction of payroll taxes that's gained little support in Congress.
 Trump has also cautioned GOP lawmakers not to box themselves in by opposing aid for state and local governments, according to a top GOP congressional aide who described Trump's view on condition of anonymity. Many state and local officials of both parties have sought more federal aid as they face eroding revenue and growing costs for unemployment and health programs.

The Air India Friday operated special charter flights to ferry 105 ONGC personnel from Patna, who would replace the staff working continuously for the past 60 days on oil exploration rigs and production platforms at Bombay High, an off-shore oil field, 176 km (approx) off the west coast of Mumbai.
 Another flight, with nearly 120 ONGC workers, is scheduled to return to Patna later in the evening.The ONGC is mobilising around 5,000 personnel across the country to rotate its staff, stranded on duty and otherwise at different locations across India.
 "So far, we have lifted our personnel from Delhi, Chennai, Kochi and Kolkata, following all the precautions as prescribed by the Centre," said Deependu Kumar, chief engineer (drilling), Sagar Vijay Oil Exploration Rig, Bombay High.
 "Our company has taken all requisite clearances from the government before moving our logistics, taking full precautions and maintaining social distancing, keeping the middle seat inside the aircraft vacant during transportation of its personnel," he said.
 The officials, who flew to Mumbai from Patna, were lifted from Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern UP. The Patna hub caters to Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh.
 "They will be taken to the ONGC's Juhu heli-base to be finally taken by choppers to our exploration site," said Gautam Kumar, superintending engineer (production), who was coordinating the operation in Patna.
 Swab samples of each of the ONGC staff were tested prior to departure, he added.
 The 109 people who returned to Mumbai from Patna, had come to their respective hometowns, while those on field duty, both on-shore and off-shore, were stranded due to the lockdown. Oil operation comes under the Essential Services Maintenance Act.
 "An Airbus-320 aircraft from Mumbai lifted 105 ONGC personnel from here at 10am. We expect another charter flight, with ONGC personnel from Mumbai, to reach Patna around 5.30pm," said Neeraj Sinha, Air India's airport manager, Patna. "We took full precautions, as per the new standard operating procedure, before allowing the passengers on board," he said.

 The analysis vividly illustrates the traffic-taming function that public transit provides in cities, as well as the importance of keeping buses and trains safe and available to riders in the future, Work said. Transit, as well as bicycling and walking, allows large numbers of people to move in a limited amount of space, unlike the alternative: “Road-building is an expensive proposition that doesn’t solve the underlying issue of high commute times in the long term,” he said.

"There's no such thing as a free press. Not anymore. Ever since a handful of pamphlets that couldn't be read by the illiterate masses evolved into mass media for the now well-educated masses, it had become clear to politicians that the free press had turned into something inconvenient, maybe even into a threat. They decided it needed to be controlled and also discovered that it could be utilized. But due to their own laws they couldn't act directly. However, they found another way. And thus all the newspapers, all the networks, hundreds of them, are these days owned by a mere handful of companies that are in turn owned by people who possess strong ties to politics. Today's press isn't free, it's '''''independently''''' owned." \- Zack Simons (een kennis van me)

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Two weeks into the reopening of Texas, coronavirus cases are climbing. New outbreaks still crop up. And at Guero's Taco Bar in Austin, which offers the occasional celebrity sighting, a log of every diner and where they sat is begrudgingly in the works.
 “It seems like a huge invasion of privacy," said owner Cathy Lipincott, who is nonetheless trying to comply with Austin's local public health guidelines by asking, but not requiring, customers to give their information.
 Few states are rebooting quicker than Texas, where stay-at-home orders expired May 1. With cases still rising, including single-day highs of 1,458 new cases and 58 deaths Thursday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has defended the pace by emphasizing steadying hospitalization rates and pointing out that Texas’ 1,200 deaths are still behind similarly big states, including California and Florida.

“Initially, the STEM project started as a three-year commitment with leadership from APG (Aberdeen Proving Ground), Cecil and Harford College presidents, public school superintendents and members of NMTC (Northeastern Maryland Technology Council). The STEM project was expanded over five-years and reached over 8,000 students.”
 Kunda recalled one of the last STEM nights hosted at Cecil College. “Along with APG personnel, technology businesses from both counties, the faculty and students at Cecil College embraced the opportunity to create hands-on STEM activities for the students and parents. It was hard to tell who was having more fun, the young participants, our students or the parents.”
 Her guidance on educational matters was tapped once more in January 2017 when she was asked to become a member of Cecil College’s Board of Trustees by Gov. Larry Hogan’s office. During her time on the board, Cecil College has completed the expansion of the Physical Education Complex along with the building of the Engineering and Math Building.
 Now, as Cecil College prepares for the fall semester during the COVID-19 pandemic, Kunda is among the board members providing sage wisdom to the leadership team that is guiding the institution through unprecedented events.
 Under the leadership of Cecil College President Dr. Mary Way Bolt, the institution completed the spring semester through remote learning and stood on a solid financial foundation.
 “I am so impressed with the leadership at the College in the midst of the pandemic. The staff, faculty, and administration have done extraordinary work getting the students online for their coursework. To do the work, the leadership has reached out to every department at the College,” said Kunda.
 “(Cecil College) was ahead of the curve for online learning and getting our students and faculty connected. Dr. Bolt stayed in constant contact with Board of Trustees’ Chairman Dr. Mark Mortenson. Cecil College website provided up- to-date information for the entire community. All this work while completing Middles State Accreditation site visit virtually and receiving a favorable evaluation.”
 Outside of her community service, Kunda is the vice president and financial officer of Bench Bus Company, Inc. since 2015 after the passing of her husband, James. Other honors she has received include the NMTC Visionary Award, Junior Achievement of Delaware Legacy Award along with being named Cecil County Chamber member of the year. She was also presented with the Athena Award honoring women who demonstrate excellence, creativity, and initiative in both professional and community leadership.

BERLIN (AP) — The German economy shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter compared with the previous three-month period as shutdowns in the country and beyond started to bite, official data showed Friday. That means Europe's biggest economy went into recession following a small dip at the end of last year.
 The figures from the Federal Statistical Office offered a first glimpse of the damage caused by the coronavirus crisis, which the government is trying to limit with rescue programs and has pushed other big European economies like France and Italy into recession.
 The decline in the January-March period was the second-biggest quarterly decline since Germany was reunited in 1990, exceeded only by a 4.7% drop in the first quarter of 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis, senior statistics office official Albert Braakmann said.
 It followed a 0.3% gain in last year's third quarter and a 0.1% contraction in the fourth quarter — the latter figure revised down from the initial report in February of zero growth. That revision put Germany into a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. In year-on-year terms, the economy took a 2.3% hit.
 March was the month in which the coronavirus pandemic hit Europe, with first Italy and then other countries imposing sweeping restrictions on public life and businesses.
 Germany itself started shutting down in mid-March. Its lockdown was less severe than those imposed in Italy, Spain and France and it never ordered factories closed, but companies did largely stop production in some areas — such as the automaking sector — and supply chains were disrupted.
 Recent data showed a 15.6% month-on-month decrease in factory orders in March, and a 9.2% drop in industrial production. Exports dropped 11.8%, the strongest decline since Germany reunited in 1990.
 The country started loosening restrictions on April 20 and the process has gathered pace recently. Shops have now reopened, restaurants are gradually opening up and auto production has restarted.
 A far worse economic performance is expected in the current second quarter.
 The German economy "will start to defreeze" in May, Allianz economist Katharina Utermoehl said in a research note. "In the short term, some catch-up effects can be expected, but the economy's underlying growth momentum is likely to pick up only gradually in the coming months."
 With millions of people in a government-backed short-time work program and unemployment rising, consumers are likely to refrain from making major purchases. she said.
 Data already released have shown that the 19-nation eurozone's economy shrank by a record 3.8% in the first quarter as business activity was frozen. France and Italy showed both fell into recession, with the French economy shrinking 5.8%, the most since the country's statistics agency began keeping the figures in 1949.
 Utermoehl said that the German economy looks set to emerge faster and in a stronger position than most of its neighbors, with an 8.9% decline in full- year gross domestic product in 2020 that would be less severe than those of France or Italy.
 She pointed to the fact that other European heavyweights needed a stricter and longer lockdown, their greater reliance on the services sector and tourism, and said that "the decisive and comprehensive policy action on behalf of the German government has been key in limiting the economic damage."

CENTREVILLE — On the eve of reopening retail businesses and manufacturing, Queen Anne’s County saw its positive COVID-19 cases rise again and posted the highest number of local residents hospitalized from the virus at one time to date.
 At the end of the day Thursday, May 14, Beth Malasky, the county’s COIVD-19 public information officer, said Queen Anne’s had 120 positive cases and four people in the hospital, three new ones that day.
 Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday the state would move from a Stay at Home order to a Safer at Home public health advisory at 5 p.m. Friday.
 “As we begin Stage One of our recovery, I want to assure every Marylander who may feel uneasy, and anyone who is concerned that we are moving either too quickly or too slowly, that each and every decision we make is both fact-based and science-based and made only after extensive consultation with our expert Coronavirus Recovery Team,” Hogan said during his press conference Wednesday. “We are continually monitoring this crisis, we remain focused on the clusters, outbreaks and hotspots, and I can assure you that we remain ready to quickly and decisively respond to any changes in the facts on the ground, and that we will continue to attack this virus with every single tool at our disposal.”
 At 5 p.m. Friday, retail businesses can reopen at 50 percent capacity with physical distancing, masks and other safety precautions. Among businesses that may reopen are clothing and shoe stores, pet groomers, animal adoption shelters, car washes, art galleries and bookstores.
 Enclosed malls remain closed, but shopping centers can open. Queenstown Premium Outlets center is anticipating reopening Friday evening, according to Queen Anne’s County Administrator Todd Mohn.
 Hair salons and barbershops may reopen at 50 percent capacity and by appointment only. Tanning salons, massage parlors and tattoo parlors remain closed.
 Manufacturing businesses, like PRS Guitars and Reeb Millwork, can reopen with appropriate safeguards in place.
 Queen Anne’s Health Officer Dr. Joseph Ciotola Jr. issued guidelines Thursday for the reopening of retail establishments including distributing copies of a “Best Practices for Businesses to Reopen” poster and a screening tool for employee health.
 The Emergency Operations Center has been working with Heather Tinelli, the county’s economic development director, and Linda Friday, president of the Queen Anne’s County Chamber of Commerce, to get word to affected businesses. All businesses opening are being asked to sign a “Back to Business Pledge” to show their commitment to the safety and health of employees and customers. The pledge promises routine cleaning and disinfecting, social distancing and promoting hand washing, among other precautions.
 “We trust our businesses to make the best decisions if we give them the best possible tools and resources to be successful,” said Eric Johnson, EOC planning section chief, in a phone interview Thursday evening.
 Face coverings continue to be required for both employees and customers inside retail businesses.
 Restaurants remain carry-out or delivery orders only.
 Child care centers are only open to children of essential workers, and schools continue with distance learning efforts with in-person instruction suspended through the end of the academic year.
 The county will be bringing most of its employees back to work on Monday, Mohn said. No decision had been made Thursday on reopening county buildings.

Clothing is normally discouraged at the Dyer Woods Nudist Campgrounds in Foster, but this year will be a little different.
 "Because of our unique situation, there will be people wearing a mask and nothing else," said Bob Difilippo, campground manager.
 Restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus have forced a lot of changes on Rhode Island businesses, including the 200-acre campground.
 Marking the start of the season, Memorial Day weekend is usually big for the campground, but this year will be quiet. At a time when interest in the camp seems to be increasing, Dyer cannot accept any non-member guests. The only campers allowed on the property are its 25 or so regular members, those who have their own trailers and keep them at the facility year-round.
 "The restrictions are very tight right now," Difilippo said.
 On a summer weekend, Dyer will typically draw 100 to 120 visitors each day, people who can enjoy hiking their trails, sunning themselves by the water, playing volleyball or Frisbee golf. The camp has sites to set up tents, park RVs and cabins for rent.
 Difilippo says he's been fielding five or six calls per day from prospective visitors wondering when the campground will open, and whether they can visit. He has to tell them no, for now.
 "We have no income coming in, really, except for those people who've renewed their leases," he said.
 Difilippo listens closely to Gov. Gina Raimondo's regular briefings for information on the regulations and possible changes. She said Wednesday that's she's considering a plan where out-of-state tourists could avoid two-week quarantine requirements this summer, if they're tested for the coronavirus when they get to the state.
 That might help the campground, Difilippo says, especially since a lot of their day-trippers visit from Connecticut -- its border is just three miles away -- but he also wonders if they'd want to go through the trouble of getting a test just to spend a day hiking or sunbathing.
 The members who do visit the campground will notice some differences. There will be no skinny dipping in the swimming pond. The camp store, clubhouse and sauna will be closed. Gathering for the popular pot-luck dinners isn't permitted.
 Difilippo has been posting notices around the property to remind campers that they must wear masks when they're within six feet of others.
 "We're telling our members to carry a mask with them at all times," Difilippo said.
 Carry them where when they don't have any pockets?
 Nude campers are used to carrying towels to put underneath them when they sit down, Difilippo noted. He added that some campers also use backpacks.
 Despite the difficulties, Difilippo says he isn't bitter about the stringent health regulations. He and others at the camp understand they're necessary to keep people healthy. He's hoping that the rules ease up by July.

Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff recalled an incident featuring former Australia captain Ricky Ponting from the second Test of the 2005 Ashes series. The Edgbaston Test is widely regarded as one of the greatest matches in the history of the longest format, which England ended up winning by just two runs.
 Flintoff produced a scintillating all-round show as he slammed half centuries in both innings and picked up three and four wickets respectively during the two Aussie innings.
 ALSO READ: Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma could remain stranded in Mumbai when India return to training, says BCCI official
 Flintoff revealed that during England's second essay, Ponting tried to rile him up and get under his skin. The former cricketer stated Ponting's sledging didn't work on him as he continued to bat without paying any heed to what the Australian had to say.
 "I can never forget Ricky Ponting in the second innings sledging me," Flintoff told Sky Sports Cricket Podcast as per Wisden.
 "I was stood there with Kevin Pietersen, he looks and he makes a joke to his team going 'Here we go boys, look at the two superstars! They're going to be happy with these two, aren't they'. And it's like 'Jog on, Rick! Jog on."
 Recently, former Australia spinner Shane Warne also jogged down memory lane as he hit out at Ponting's decision to bowl first in this particular Test.
 "Punter's (Ponting) decision to bowl first was just the worst decision ever, by any captain. So take a back seat, Nas (Nasser Hussain), Punter has got your back," Warne was quoted as saying by foxsports.com.au.

 OTTAWA--Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce today an extension to the federal government's 75 per cent emergency wage subsidy -- just as businesses across the country are taking the first cautious steps toward reopening after a two-month, pandemic-induced shutdown.
 He is also expected to announce significant financial support for thousands of medical researchers whose work is unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis.
 The $73-billion wage subsidy program was initially slated to run until June 6.
 Trudeau last week said it would be extended and today he'll reveal for how long. The extension is expected to be for at least an extra month.
 Under the program, the federal government is currently picking up the tab for 75 per cent of an eligible company's payroll -- up to a maximum of $847 per week per employee -- from March 15 to June 6.
 Eligible companies are those that saw revenues drop by 15 per cent in March or 30 per cent in April and May.
 The government has billed the subsidy as the largest economic program since the Second World War, with the cost pegged at $73 billion.
 But so far, it has paid out only $3.4 billion for some 1.7 million workers.
 However, the government sees the wage subsidy as crucial to the country's economic recovery and is hoping that more companies will take advantage of it as they rehire employees laid off when the country shut down in mid-March to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
 That, in turn, would decrease reliance on the $35-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which is paying $2,000 a month to Canadians who have been thrown out of work or seen their incomes nosedive due to the pandemic.
 More than 7.5 million Canadians have received CERB payments so far -- almost double the anticipated number of recipients.
 The government is widely expected to eventually phase out the CERB to prevent it becoming a disincentive to work as the economy restarts.
 Trudeau is also expected today to announce financial support to prevent the threatened layoffs of up to 15,000 researchers at hospital-based research institutes who, due to a technicality, don't qualify for the wage subsidy.
 Research unrelated to the deadly coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was halted in mid-March, including clinical trials and research into cancer, stroke and other diseases. Hospital-based institutes have warned that much of the funding they rely on to pay for that research -- including charitable donations, contributions from foundations and clinical trial contracts with pharmaceutical companies -- has evaporated.
 Without financial support from the government, they've warned that they'll have to begin laying off thousands of researchers by the end of this week.
 Trudeau promised earlier this week to personally look into the matter.

Although the earnings report is nothing to write home about, it's not extraordinarily bad. An extended lockdown and travel restrictions have all but eroded any chance of profitability for airlines. However, the silver lining is that once demand resurfaces, companies that were nicely progressing will get the inevitable bump in the stock market.

"Now, former presidents get deposed," he continued. "They are absolutely within the rule of law. That's one of the things that makes America America. But the weaponization, the coinage of this term, which I'm not going to say, but the coinage of the term is an absolute — I can't call it an apotheosis, because that would suggest it's the height of something — it's the full manifestation of the Trump era. It's grabbing at nothing and attempting to mislead just enough people by demonizing his predecessor that he can make hay out of that. It's another blow against the role of fact in America."

He said, when state enterprises start doing such investments it turns out to be like an attempt to take over the direct responsibility of the government because the government has its own responsibilities and so do the state enterprises. Focusing and executing their core mandate to perfection must be the way to go.

MIAMI (AP) — Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise company, announced on Thursday it will be laying off hundreds of employees due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 The company's CEO Arnold Donald said the combination of layoffs, furloughs and pay cuts were "necessary" as the pause on cruise travel enters its third month.
 The majority of affected employees in the U.S. will be in Florida, California and Washington state, Carnival Corp. said in an email. The company is eliminating 820 positions and furloughing 537 employees for up to six months in Florida out of a workforce of about 3,000 employees.
 Carnival Corp. did not reveal the number of job eliminations in the other states or countries around the world.
 "Taking these extremely difficult employee actions involving our highly dedicated workforce is a very tough thing to do. Unfortunately, it's necessary, given the current low level of guest operations and to further endure this pause," Donald said in a statement.
 Cruise lines announced they were halting sailing on March 13 due to the spread of the coronavirus. Several cruise ships saw outbreaks of COVID-19 cases and found themselves stranded at sea after being rejected by port authorities who were worried they would import more cases.
 Companies have been trying to repatriate tens of thousands of crew members who are still on ships in or near U.S. waters due to the increase in restrictions by health authorities in the U.S. and abroad.
 Carnival Cruise Line, one of the company's brands, announced earlier this month it will start cruising again beginning in August to Caribbean destinations from Florida and Texas.

Implementing these reliable storage systems used to be complex. There were many different types of RAID (0, 1, 5, 6, 10, etc...) that all offered different benefits. Modern NAS devices figure that all out for you. You simply tell it how much redundancy (or none at all) you want, and everything is calculated behind the scenes. Synology calls their system Synology Hybrid Raid (SHR). This system operates like RAID 5 or RAID 6 under the hood. If you'd like a more detailed explanation of the differences, NASCompares has a great piece on that.

As mentioned above, Karma wants to license its platform to other companies. It says the platform offers a solution for firms looking for a fast, relatively low-cost solution to entering the EV game. By using an off-the-shelf platform, a company can avoid the cost of developing, testing and certifying one from scratch. Of course, Karma isn't the only company in the EV space looking to sell both cars and technology. Rival EV startups Bollinger, Canoo and Rivian also have platforms up for sale.

Zipp's two downward-facing bolts mean you can tighten the bolts alternately with the same 5mm Allen key until you've got it perfect – but the front one is tricky to get started because its in a cutout that's too narrow for fingers and angled so you can't use a multi-tool without the handle getting in the way. It took me a few attempts at balancing the bolt on the end of a single Allen key with with the other hand holding the loose nut in place on top of the clamp (I could have done with a third hand to hold the saddle in place), but once it started threading it was more or less plain sailing. I was able to get the tilt exactly right immediately and it hasn't moved since.
