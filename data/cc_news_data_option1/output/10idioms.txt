This guest column was written by Rosie Sill, president of the Bloomington Winter Farmers’ Market and a farm vendor at the Bloomington Community Farmers’ Market; Louise Miracle, vice president of the winter market and a prepared food vendor at the summer market; Caitlin Watkins, treasurer of the winter market; and Kathy Aiken, secretary of the winter market.
 Dear Mayor Hamilton,
 Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to share our concerns regarding the current circumstances of the Bloomington Community Farmers’ Market. Our community is faced with a troublesome situation. Some believe the solution is to privatize the city market. As a result, the city of Bloomington is considering dissolving the Community Farmers’ Market, abandoning the vendors and leaving them with the responsibility of forming a market from scratch.

Difficult to diagnose, PANDAS can suddenly appear following strep throat or scarlet fever. The symptoms are usually dramatic, happen “overnight and out of the blue,” and can include motor or vocal tics or both and obsessions and compulsions, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Instead of going after the strep bacteria, antibodies target the brain — causing obsessive-compulsive disorder, tics and other neuropsychiatric symptoms of PANDAS.

“But at the same time, (running backs coach Ja’Juan Seider) does a good job giving each of us enough touches to where we can make plays. And that’s all we can really ask for. At the end of the day, you can’t pout about how many touches you get. You have to make plays when your number is called. If you do that, everything else will take care of itself.”

“Our room could have went sideways quick, just a guy pouting or yelling at the coach about wanting more touches,” Cain said. “I’m not going to sit here and say it’s not frustrating. At the end of the day, there are going to be games everybody gets touches, and there are going to be games where a dude’s not happy.

You made me feel safe in an dangerous world — and for that, I could never repay you.”

Throughout the season, Alexander seemed to be at his best against the six Lapel opponents with winning records. In those games, Alexander threw for nearly 1,100 yards, rushed for 250 yards and accounted for 16 total touchdowns. After the season, Alexander was named All-State by the Indiana Football Coaches Association.
 “For me, it’s always one of those things where you want to go out and help the team compete the best they can,” Alexander said. “When you play somebody better, you have to raise your own game. The better you play, the better chance the team can win.”
 And win they did. With Alexander as the starting quarterback the last two seasons, the Bulldogs were 13-9 and won the sectional in 2018. In that game, it was Alexander who led a late Lapel rally to upend Shenandoah, and he nearly repeated the feat at unbeaten Eastern (Greentown) this season. In the game, Alexander threw for 250 yards and three scores. Although the Comets scored on the game’s final play to send the Bulldogs home, Alexander had engineered the go-ahead drive in the game’s waning moments.
 “My mindset for that is, ‘You’ve got this, you’ve worked hard for this’,” he said. “At the same time, it takes all 11 of us to get it done, that’s why football is such a beautiful thing.”
