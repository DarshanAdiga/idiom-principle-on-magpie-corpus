It will probably get what it wants. But when push comes to shove, hollowing out the platform is certain to anger a lot of Republican party actors. And the gain from doing so is … just about nothing.

 The first priority though, before diving too deep into potential opponents, is getting Tyson on board for the fight. And as of now it still sounds like an uphill battle.

Hart was one of three people involved in a September crash in Calabasas, California.
 Hart and the driver, Jared Black, sustained back injuries and were taken to nearby hospitals, according to a California Highway Patrol incident report obtained by CNN. The third occupant, Black's fiancée Rebecca Broxterman, did not suffer any substantial injuries.
 The three were traveling in a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda owned by Hart. Black was turning onto Mulholland Highway near Malibu when he accelerated and lost control, the highway patrol report stated. The car careened down an embankment and slammed into a tree, with Hart in the passenger's seat and Broxterman in the back.
 Hart told Rogan during the podcast that he pretended to be better than he actually was while he was recuperating.
 "I lied in the hospital because I didn't want them to know that I was having pain," Hart said, "because I thought that they were gonna stop me from letting me continue to try my walks."

“Indeed, if our ‘highly-respected former footballer’ had to have a word in the ear of every Austin Stacks player who played other sports, he’d be out and about from first light until the stars come out!”
 Stacks was founded in 1917 and says it is “particularly proud“ of its Juvenile section – the jewel in the crown.
 “Mr Daly posed the question ‘should Stacks not be more worried about trying to recruit young lads ahead of (Kerins) O’Rahillys, (John) Mitchels, and Na Gaeil - the other clubs in the town – instead of telling one of their own to turn his back on hurling and his friends.’
 “Not at all, we are happy with our fair share and, as mentioned above, hurling is part of the Rock DNA. All of the GAA Clubs in Tralee coexist in a spirit of mutual respect and co-operation. The clubs are rivals on the field of play but there are longstanding acquaintances and friendships off the field.”
 It accepts there has been a “regrettable decline in our hurling section” but says Stacks are pleased to support the initiative of the new Tralee Parnells Hurling and Camogie Club in promoting those games in the Tralee area.
 “That club is now effectively doing what Austin Stacks did for many years. We are delighted that any of our players, who are interested in hurling, now have a local hurling club on their doorstep.
 “To the best of our knowledge, Anthony Daly has never set foot in Connolly Park. He has never seen how our wonderful club goes about its business. He wrote a very poorly researched article based on a nod and a wink. He did Austin Stacks a grave injustice. If he’d like to soak up the exhilarating atmosphere in Connolly Park and meet with the ‘rare auld stock of the Rock’, he’d be more than welcome to visit Austin Stacks at any time.”

When Cone Health announced they would resume some elective surgeries and catch up on postponed appointments earlier this month, representatives also said they'd be taking extra precautions to protect patients and staff. The hospital system is following through on those promises by increasing the use of UV light disinfecting devices in local facilities.
   
 When it gets dark, you can occasionally see what Cone Health is calling light strikes, a bright glow from windows in the hospital. These light strikes are produced by Xenex and Tru-D devices, which according to recent research, can kill COVID-19 in minutes.
   
 "The robots play an important part of efforts to keep COVID-19 from spreading in Cone Health hospitals," a statement from the hospital system said May 21.
   
 The light strikes are an intense form of ultraviolet light, which according to Michrochem Laboratory, have been in use in U.S. hospitals for disinfection since about 2007.
   
 "(The light strike) is so intense that no one can be in the room when the devices are in use. But the germs have nowhere to go," the statement said.
      
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cone Health has significantly increased their use of these devices, which have proven an effective second step of a cleaning routine.
   
 In a recent test at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute, the light from Xenex devices killed COVID-19 viruses in 2 minutes, Cone Health said.
   
 "We have increased the use of our machines by 40 to 50 percent during this pandemic. As we move to resuming more surgeries, we are sanitizing areas around the clock," Joshua Andrews, executive director of environmental services for Cone Health, said.
   
 The machines were previously used at Moses Cone Day Surgery and anywhere patients with highly contagious diseases stayed.
   
 Cone Health has 10 Xenex machines and five Tru-D devices in use at hospitals in Alamance, Guilford and Rockingham counties.
   
 "Every environmental services tech has been trained to use the devices. This allows more areas of hospitals to be disinfected in this manner," Andrews said.
   
 The UV disinfecting robots are being used to clean all hospital clinic areas, staff lounges, on-call rooms, waiting areas, and public restrooms.
   
 To ensure safety, Cone Health said staff is also cleaning the rooms by hand as a second layer of disinfection.
   
 "Our environmental services staff manually clean and disinfect using the latest techniques and guidance. They cap off their work with a UV robot as an extra layer of safety," Andrews explained. "We want people to be safe coming into a hospital. This is one way we do that."

WALPOLE--With schools shuttered in March through to at least June, plants growing at the Norfolk County Agricultural High School for its annual plant sale were left in limbo until the three-pronged Aggie Abundance program was formulated by staff and administrators.
 First up, the plants students had started to grow after February vacation that were slated for the annual plant sale to raise approximately $20,000 for the school each year. While groundskeeper Patrick Collins kept them going for three weeks after schools were closed in addition to his other jobs, plant science teacher Jeff Thompson and others stepped in to help when they were allowed back on campus.
 In all, 100 plants were delivered to Norwood Hospital staff, 50 plants to the Walpole Fire Department, and 50 plants to the Walpole Police Department, all on the Friday before Mother's Day as a way to thank first responders.
 "They were so appreciative," Thompson said. "It made me feel great to help them because they do so much for the community."
 Part two for the Aggie Abundance initiative is to distribute plants to school families after the school grounds are planted. While students typically would be helping with the beautification of the campus, Thompson said it is school staff that will be doing the work this time.
 "We plant the campus to the nines," Thompson said. "It really looks beautiful. If seniors do get a chance to walk and receive their diplomas, we want it to look nice for them. There's a lot of pride in our school and I think it's reflected in how it looks."
 Teacher Lisa Collins said they put in the extra effort to make the campus appealing because a large number of people from the community walk around the campus.
 "It's like a public park," Collins said. "It's kind of a shining jewel in the county."
 She said a survey was sent out to families to see who could come pick up plants and who needed a delivery.
 "Everything will already be pre-boxed so when they arrive, we put them in their trunk," Collins said. "We're very mindful of making this a safe distribution."
 For the third initiative, Thompson said the school will be planting a Covid Victory Garden instead of the usual pumpkins that are planted on 1.5 acres of land for the annual haunted hay rides.
 He said last year they received a donation of 1,500 packages of seeds from the University of Rhode Island and he has planted everything, some 10,000 plants, in the school's greenhouses.
 Peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, kale and other durable vegetables that do not require a lot of refrigeration will be grown and distributed to school families first, and then food pantries, for those who are struggling and will possibly continue to struggle with the economic fallout from the pandemic and job losses.
 "We're hoping to offset some food shortages and food insecurities," Thompson said. "The idea is, 'let's not waste any of this stuff, let's get it out to people who need it.'"
 Collins said the Covid Victory Garden will supply a free weekly Farmer's Market for Aggie families.
 "We already have staff ready to deliver to families that don't have a car," Collins said. "We don't want somebody's economic status to inhibit them from participating in the program."
 She said they will also be coordinating with the Walpole Food Pantry and Abundant Harvest to see who might be in need of what so any extra crops will not be wasted.
 Thompson said the initiative is in line with what the school was moving toward before the pandemic hit, namely the reintroduction of growing food on campus, with students running the program with staff support.
 "It they come back in September, there will be plenty for the kids to go out and pick," Thompson said.
 Thompson points to the collaboration between staff and administration as the key to bringing all the ideas to fruition and Collins agrees.
 "The Aggie is an excellent place to work even during times of quarantine," Collins said. There's a lot of good going on."

 Free State police are working around the clock to trace a four-year-old boy who went missing in the Thaba Patswa location at Tweespruit.
 Police spokesperson Brig Motansti Makhele said the mother of the missing child, Anastatia March, alerted officers that Mpho Albert March was missing after he went to the veld with a 15-year-old boy.
 “The older boy alleged Mpho looked tired and he told him to wait while he fetched cattle further away from others. He could not identify the spot where he left him as the area is bushy,” said Makhele.
 Makhele said the mother became worried and went to look for him without success.
 “She reported the child missing. Police and rescue dogs are searching. An aerial search is also being conducted," he said.
 Makhele said anyone with information about the child is requested to contact their nearest police station.

The UK government has now given the green light for contact training to resume, with clubs set to vote on the protocols on Wednesday.
 Should the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League all be completed, City could face 17 games in little over two months once the action gets underway.
 But Guardiola is pleased with the fitness of his players given they have not played competitively since March 8.
 "I think they were looking forward to coming back and to train again and do what they like," he added. "They came back perfectly."
 Even when football does return in England, matches are set to be behind closed doors for the forseeable future.
 Fears have been raised over the possibility that fans could congregate around stadiums, but there has been little evidence of such problems in Germany since the return of the Bundesliga.
 And Guardiola encouraged fans to continue adhering to the health and safety guidelines.
 "We want to come back but now the priority is other things. It's still stay safe, be careful and when everything is possible we will come back," he said.
 "The most important thing is to follow the instructions. If they say use a mask, stay at home, social distance, we have to do it. Because there are many, many people in the NHS (National Health Service) around the world who put their own lives at risk to save ours.
 "It's incredible what they have done, and we have to follow them. Now, we cannot do anything wrong."

EVERYONE is more stressed than usual at the moment. This is not surprising as we are navigating our way through an unprecedented global pandemic.   For many of us, increased stress results in an increase in physical tension which may be experienced as muscle tightness and even pain. We are hearing people describing upper body pains and aches, tension headaches and wakening from sleep with sore muscles. To add insult to injury, because of current public health restrictions, many people are missing the opportunity to avail of some popular strategies for relieving tension such as going for a swim and sauna, or going for a massage.   From a psychological point of view, we recognise that there is a circular relationship between physical tension and emotional stress - tense body equals tense mind and vice versa. So in order to allow our minds to relax and slow down a little, we need also to relax our bodies.   In this article we will describe a set of exercises called progressive muscular relaxation which we often use with clients to help them relax, both physically and mentally. Progressive muscular relaxation (PMR) was developed by an American physician, Edmund Jacobsen in the 1920s. It is based on the fact that by tensing muscles before relaxing them, the muscles can relax more fully after releasing, letting go of physical tension more effectively.   Practising PMR helps us elicit the “relaxation response”, first described by Harvard physician Herbert Benson. Psychological research has shown that people who regularly practise PMR spend less time worrying. Regular practice of PMR has also been shown to help with general stress and anxiety management, with improving sleep and pain management.   In order to get ready to practise PMR, it is a good idea to find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed for about 20 minutes. Ideally, turn off phone and device notifications. The exercises can be done lying down or else sitting comfortably, for example on a recliner chair. You will tense each muscle group for about five or six seconds. If you have any pain or discomfort in any of the key muscle groups, proceed very gently or else omit that step. Pay attention to the sensation of relaxation as you experience it in each muscle group, you may notice a feeling of heaviness, or lightness or warmth. Be aware that it is perfectly normal that your mind will wander as you go through the exercises. When this happens, simply bring your attention gently back to your breathing and the muscle group you are working on.   To begin, close your eyes or else look downwards at a spot on the floor. Now, roll your eyes upwards towards 12 o’clock. Then return the eyes to the resting position. This simple movement stimulates alpha waves in the brain, which are helpful in bringing on a state of calm and relaxation. Now bring attention to your breath. Notice as you inhale and exhale.   Next, focus on taking a few slow, deep abdominal breaths. Breathing slowly and deeply helps engage the parasympathetic nervous system which is the rest-and- digest system. For this deep relaxed breathing, inhale slowly through the nose, allowing the breath all the way down to the abdomen as if you were inflating a balloon in your tummy, then exhale slowly through the mouth. Breathe in for the count of four, hold for the count of four, then breathe out for the count of six. Repeat this breathing cycle five or six times before resuming normal breathing. Remember to keep breathing rather than holding the breath as you go through the muscle exercises.   Now, bring your attention to your hands. Clench your fists and hold in this tense position for about five seconds. All at once, let go of that tension and allow the hands to relax. Next, tighten both hands into fists and bring the fists up towards your shoulders, tightening the biceps muscles. Hold for five seconds, then release the tension. Flex the hands back at the wrists so that you feel tension in the wrists and lower arms. Hold for five seconds and then relax those muscles.   Bring your attention next to your shoulders. Shrug your shoulders up towards your ears. Hold for about five seconds and then quickly release, letting go of the tension. Gently pull your head back as if to look at the ceiling. Hold for about five seconds, and release, feeling the tension melting away.   Now bring your chin forward towards your chest, hold for five seconds and feel the tension in the back of your neck. Gently return your head to neutral and let the muscles relax.   Tighten the muscles in your forehead by raising your eyebrows as high as you can. Hold for about five seconds and then relax.   Next tighten your eye muscles by squinting your eyelids tightly shut. Hold for about five seconds and release.   Now bring attention to your mouth and jaw. Tense the jaw by clenching your back teeth and holding this for about five seconds. Release and leave your mouth open slightly.   Tense your upper back by pulling your shoulders back trying to make your shoulder blades touch. Hold for five seconds and release. Tighten your chest by taking a deep breath in, hold for about five seconds, and exhale, blowing out all the tension.   Now tighten the muscles in your stomach by pulling them in. Hold for about five seconds, and release. Gently arch your lower back. Hold for five seconds and release.   Now bring attention to your legs. Stretch your legs as if you were trying to lengthen the muscles. Hold for about five seconds then let go of the tension. Point your toes towards your head and feel the tension in your calf muscles. Hold for five seconds and relax.   Now imagine a wave of relaxation slowly spreading through your body beginning at your head and going all the way down to your toes. Gently repeat any of the exercises in areas where there is still some muscle tension. Take a few slow deep relaxed breaths and enjoy the sensations of the body relaxing.   The above instructions are a shortened version of PMR, which we regularly use with clients who are working on stress or anxiety management.   We often record them as it is helpful to have a voice guiding you through the exercises. If you are going to begin practising PMR, you could easily record the instructions on your phone, or else you will find recorded PMR exercises on Spotify or Youtube. Relaxing the body is an important step in relaxing the mind and we can all benefit from a little relaxation at this very challenging time.
