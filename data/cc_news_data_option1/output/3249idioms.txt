MumbaiA 55-year-old real estate developer was stabbed to death by a man while he was on his way to offer prayers at Irla Jama Masjid in Juhu at 6am on Monday. Abdul Munaf Shaikh, a resident of Saifi House in Andheri (West), was walking towards the mosque when an unknown person wearing a cap attacked him from behind. Juhu police have detained three suspects in the case so far, but the killer is still on the run. The police, after reviewing CCTV footage which recorded the murder, said that Shaikh, who is also a trustee of the mosque, was caught unawares when a man attacked him and slit his throat. The accused then stabbed him multiple times on his head, back, stomach and chest, said police officers. Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone 9, said, "Soon after the incident, people from the mosque rushed him to Cooper Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival." "We have identified the killer and an offence under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Juhu police station. The killer is still on the run. We are investigating case thoroughly," said Trimukhe. "Being a real estate developer, he had built many buildings and had also undertaken a Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) project recently. We are probing possible angles," added the officer.As part of the investigation, the police detained three men, including the son of a man who had sold a piece of land to Shaikh in 2010. He was allegedly unhappy that his father had sold the land at a cheap rate and had threatened Shaikh on many occasions, said a police officer."In 2019, Shaikh was planning to develop the plot. We are questioning many and have detained three people so far," said the police officer.Asif Ali Shaikh, a relative of the deceased, said, "Shaikh had notices someone following him when he used to go to the mosque for morning prayers. He had also filed a written complaint to DN Nagar police, but no one took cognizance."

Mumbai After initiating 67% cut to the outlay of its development schemes and banning new recruitments, the state government has now announced a 30% cut in the remuneration paid to outside consultants. The government has 400 such consultants working through six leading companies. The move is expected to save the exchequer to the tune of ₹36 crore in this financial year.The government resolution (GR) issued on Monday has directed all the departments to reduce 30% of the remuneration paid to the consultants. Various departments of the government have appointed six companies including Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Wipro for technical and other consultancies on various programmes and schemes. The consultants are paid a remuneration ranging between ₹198,000 and ₹356,400 per person per month depending on their experience, as per the last rate revision on March 20, 2019. The government, in the GR, asked its departments and sub-establishments to restrict the appointment of such consultants to two per department. "Most of our consultants are from the information and technology sector, which itself has given pay cuts to their employees. On the similar line and in light of the economic crisis, we have decided to reduce their payments," said an official from the finance department, requesting anonymity.The remuneration of these consultants is mainly incorporated in the project cost.

Chandigarh The city's bid to transition from fossil fuel to renewable sources of energy has received the corona jolt.Facing a fund crunch in the wake of the pandemic, the UT administration has stalled the shifting of the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) bus fleet from diesel to electric for the current financial year at least.The plans, set in motion last year, to buy 40 electric buses for the CTU local fleet has been suspended for the current financial year. The medium sized (9m) battery-operated buses were planned to be procured on the gross cost-contract model.Confirming the development, Uma Shankar Gupta, director transport, said, "For the time being the project has been deferred. There were financial constraints in view of the pandemic."The addition of electric buses to the CTU fleet is a long-term plan for a greater environmentally-friendly public transport system. The transport department plans to phase out ordinary buses after the full cycle is completed.ALL 400 BUSES TO BE MADE ELECTRICAs per the plan, all ordinary buses will be replaced with electric buses in time. There are around 400 buses, and nearly half of these are nearing completion of their operational life.The administration had even floated tenders for the buses. After failing to procure electric buses in its previous two attempts, the administration received two bids in the third tender it had floated in January this year. The new buses were to be made operational by September, but the pandemic hit.After the Union government refused to finance the buying of 40 electric buses, the department in June last year decided to procure them on the gross cost- contract model. Under the model, the successful bidder has to procure, operate and maintain the buses. All revenue is collected for the administration, and the company is paid on a per kilometre cost basis. The medium-sized (9m) battery-operated buses are to be equipped with air-conditioners and are to be used on local city routes.QUESTIONS RAISED ON PROJECT'S FINANCIAL VIABILITYThe finance department had raised questions over the financial viability of the project. In response, the transport department had contended that the department's own revenues and the revenues generated from the project itself would finance the project.But with only 150 local buses operating from the 400-bus fleet, generating adequate revenue to make the project viable will be difficult. "Due to the pandemic, for nearly three months, all the CTU buses were off road and consequently no revenue was generated. Even now for ensuring social distancing norms, the buses are running on half of their capacity. The CTU is now under a greater financial stress," said a CTU official, requesting anonymity.

Just because something is common does not mean it is normal. Many diseases are common nowadays, yet few would consider them normal. For example, while obesity and diabetes are rampant, none would argue that these conditions are normal or should go untreated. However, when it comes to problems of the urinary tract, this is often the case. Millions of individuals suffer from urinary incontinence – the involuntary loss of urine. Leakage can occur due to a strong “gotta go, gotta go” urge, activity such as coughing or laughing, or even without awareness. Few people seek treatment for these bothersome, yet very treatable, conditions.
 On average, patients wait six years or more to bring these urinary complaints to their physicians. And some never do. Many are under the impression that incontinence is a normal part of aging, or something one must simply live with. This could not be further from the truth. Leakage itself is rarely dangerous, however serious consequences can arise from incontinence. Waking frequently at night or rushing to the bathroom can lead to falls, which in turn can result in injury and even the need for nursing home care.
 These situations, while dangerous, are oftentimes completely preventable. The first step is a careful history and physical examination by a specialist. People leak for a multitude of reasons, and successful treatment depends upon correct diagnosis. Most types of leakage can be eliminated or cured. Depending on the cause, often a trial of simple behavioral modifications can do the trick. These may include limiting fluid intake, avoiding bladder irritants or urinating on a set schedule. Pelvic floor physical therapy may also be an option.
 Some patients with a constant urge to urinate, frequent urination, or night waking may require the help of a medication. And not all medications have bothersome side effects. Fortunately, other options do exist. If medication does not work or is not appropriate, we have a multitude of office-based procedures in addition to minor surgical ones. For leakage with activity, a ten-minute procedure can cure leakage for years to come. Not every treatment option is appropriate for every patient, but the bottom line is that options do exist.
 It saddens me to think of the number of individuals who suffer in silence with these and other very treatable complaints. And while these conditions affect up to half or more of all adults, they are not “normal”. If you are bothered by urinary complaints, be sure to let your doctor know and seek out the help of a urologist who specializes in pelvic medicine. Your quality of life could improve dramatically, and you will be glad you did.

The University of Georgia has stopped its daily update of COVID-19 cases among members of the UGA community, but says it will resume weekly reporting beginning Wednesday.
   
 Thursday is the first day of fall semester classes.
   
 Before halting its daily reporting last week, UGA's University Health Center had been compiling numbers from two sources: voluntary reporting and test results from people who went to the University Health Center for testing.
   
 As of Aug. 10, that total was 457 cases, including many people who had not been on campus since the University System of Georgia sent students and employees home as the pandemic gathered steam in March, according to the University Health Center.
   
 That cumulative total "was never intended to serve as an accurate barometer of the current status of COVID-19 at UGA at any point in time," according to the University Health Center website.
   
 Now, UGA has begun a surveillance testing plan, asking for asymptomatic student and employee volunteers to come to a testing site at Legion Field near the university's' high-rise residence halls on Baxter Street. There is no charge to be tested. The test samples will be analyzed by a lab in the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine.
   
 UGA's goal was to reach 300 tests a day by Monday and conduct 24,000 COVID-19 tests by Thanksgiving. Students will leave campus at Thanksgiving to finish out the remainder of fall semester at home, including final exams.
   
 Starting Wednesday and continuing each Wednesday thereafter, the UGA University Health Center will post a summary of the previous week's results.
   
 Other universities have also instituted surveillance testing.
   
 Georgia Tech has set up a network of testing sites across its campus, with a goal of 1,500 tests a day.
   
 Georgia Tech has also been keeping a list of COVID cases among its staff and students, but has been including information on each individual case, without personal identifying information but including whether the person was a student or staff member, the date he or she was last on the campus, and for staff members, where the person worked on campus.
   
 "The staff member works in Housing and is isolating; all affected individuals are being notified as consistent with Georgia Department of Public Health," reads one recent entry in the Tech list.
   
 As of Sunday, the Georgia Department of Public Health listed 237,030 cases of COVID-19 in Georgia, and 4,702 deaths. According to the CDC, Georgia now has recorded more COVID cases than all but the nation's four most populous states -- California, New York, Texas and Florida.
   
 THE DPH website listed 2,250 cases of COVID-19 and 21 deaths in Clarke County as of Sunday, according to the DPH website. Nearly a fourth of Clarke's cases, 511, were reported in the past two weeks.
