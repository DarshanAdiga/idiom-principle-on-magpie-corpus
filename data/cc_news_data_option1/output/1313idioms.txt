The NFL if giving football fans something to latch on to, something to feed their quest for any kind of sports whatsoever.
 Some say what the league is doing is disrespectful, some say it's only being done for greed. I hear the line, "How can they do business as usual with all the suffering going on around the country?"
 These people don't get that the NFL doing business is helping the many sports fans out there to get through these tough times with a mental break from the coronavirus. Football fans who may have lost their jobs now have a welcome distraction.
 The big yearly production that is the NFL Draft has been pushed back but not eliminated as of yet. I hope they still hold it even if it has to be done completely via satellite feed and without a live audience. I still want to see who the Steelers end up with in the second round.
 I don't buy the "disrespectful" angle. To me, this is one of those situations where there's a certain faction of people who feel if they are suffering then everyone else should, too.
 I don't really care if there are greed reasons or whatever for the NFL to still be up and running, I'm just glad they are. The sports world needs that right now.

 One way to fill a thirst for actual sports is watching old DVDs or television broadcasts of classic games and events from the past, and I've been taking that path at home on occasion.
 I've recently popped in the Penguins' Game 6 Stanley Cup clinching victory over the North Stars (Spoiler alert ... 8-0 Pens, still the biggest margin of victory in a Cup-clinching game), Game 7 of the 1971 World Series (people forget how Orioles manager Earl Weaver tried to rattle Pirates starter Steve Blass -- to no avail -- by complaining to the umpires that his foot wasn't on the rubber when he was pitching), and Steelers Super Bowl victory No. 5 against the Seattle Seahawks.
 Watching Super Bowl XL again made me shake my heads at the whiners from Seattle who still claim they were robbed by the officials.

Of late, there has been a surge in the demand for diesel originating from both domestic and industrial applications. As hydrogen is used in the reduction of sulfur content in diesel fuel, the demand for hydrogen generation will also increase. Developing economies have been requiring large volumes of crude oil due to the robust growth in industrialization, aiding the expansion of the global hydrogen generation market. Refineries over the world are being upgraded so as to extend their productivity and efficiency, apart from meeting the strict regulatory standards related to sulfur emission. This has led to increasing investments for the same. All these factors have stoked the growth of the global hydrogen generation market.

“It won’t cost them anything,” Etheridge said. “All they need to do is send me an email (canemile@atlanticbb.net), tell me what book they want, or if they want all of them. I will send them the eBook, I’ll attach the PDF to an email and send it back to them and they’ll have an opportunity to read the book. There will be no charge, Maybe when they’re done if they want they can drop me a little note letting me know what they thought. I’d love to hear from the public.”
 Etheridge stressed that he’s happy to do his part in this unique world we currently live in.
 “It’s giving back to the community,” he said. “I’ve been blessed. I’m a Fayette Countian with all my heart and just want to help out somehow. I think this is one way to do that. I think it’s something people will enjoy reading and it’s free of charge, no strings attached.
 “Folks can read it on their phone, their tablet, or share it. They can send it to their friends. This would be something personal from me for them.”
 Etheridge is a role model whose own personal story is heart-warming and inspiring. He was placed in special education classes while in high school but went on to graduate from college and became a teacher in the Uniontown Area School District for 22 years.
 Sports fans may remember Etheridge as an outstanding basketball player for the Red Raiders who went on to be an assistant coach at Uniontown under head coach Dave Shuck for 10 years.

BUDAPEST -- Hungary will introduce a new pandemic fund on Saturday and work out the details of the country's biggest economic stimulus package by Tuesday, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, adding that the plans focus primarily on employment.
 Healthcare workers will receive a 500,000 forint ($1,500) bonus this year to compensate them for the extra workload and risk that fighting the coronavirus entails, he added.
 Hungary, like most other countries, has already been hit hard by the fallout from the coronavirus epidemic, with business grinding to a virtual halt, and the important car manufacturing and tourism sectors all but shutting down.
 With tens of thousands of jobs lost in March, Orban said the economic stimulus package would have to react to the crisis and prepare for life afterwards.
 "We will have to create as many jobs as the crisis destroys," he told state radio on Friday. A Pandemic Fund will be introduced on Saturday, and detailed economic stimulus plans on Tuesday, he said.
 He said Hungary would not join countries throwing limitless funds at the crisis, but would focus on maintaining a work-centered economic philosophy because any money spent now would have to be made later.
 "The circumstances have changed now but our goals remain the same, except the route to them has changed," he said. "I don't want my country to return to an aid-based economy, because that leads to loans, which leads to indebtedness."
 In his decade in power, Orban dragged the economy out of a deep debt and deficit trap and maintained rigorous finances, while drawing criticism for unorthodox fiscal moves that often taxed foreign business interests.
 Orban also responded to criticism from the European Union, the United States and rights groups this week about his extension of special powers, including the open-ended right to rule by decree until the end of the pandemic.
 "Brussels is busy with us, while they should be busy with the virus," he said. "The Hungarian government's emergency powers are roughly the same as the French president has in peacetime. Clearly we are under political attack."
 "The main thing is that we stay the course … this is a network, which would like to strip Hungary of its resources, with George Soros at the helm, with his people in Brussels criticizing us."
 Soros is a favorite scapegoat for Orban, who was once a protege of the billionaire financier. (Reporting by Marton Dunai Editing by David Goodman and Giles Elgood)

It was only in the spring of last year that the government handed over the land for the new home. As contractors and construction companies were flooded with orders, it was only days ago that the Nakayamas were able to conduct a ceremony to pray for the safety of the construction, which typically takes place before contractors start building the home.
 At present, they are slated to move into the new home in the summer, when Japan was initially scheduled to host the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.
 Many residents have already left the Takinosato housing complex, which at one point accommodated 86 households.
 Dozens of units have been left vacant and the community meeting room is barely used now. Nakayama had often gathered there with about a dozen friends for a morning exercise, but many of them have moved out in the past year.
 A woman in her 60s who puts on the music on a radio cassette player for the morning exercise — Nakayama has a hard time figuring out how to play it on her own — was moving out in March for a new home.
 Nakayama’s other friend, a 95-year-old woman who lives there, has been busy packing her things to move out.
 "It’s a good thing that they’re moving out but I’m always the one who waves goodbye, being left here on my own,” Nakayama lamented.
 In April, 38 people from 17 households still living in makeshift housing in other areas will temporarily move into the Takinosato units until they move on to a new home.
 Some of the survivors, however, are finding it difficult to move on due to financial hardships.
 A 39-year-old barber who lives with his family in one of the city’s makeshift housing units in Rikuzentakata runs a barber shop in a rented building nearby, catering to the dwindled number of local customers. With the city devastated by the 2011 massive tsunami causing people to flee, there are not enough customers for him to make a living.
 Although he has land in the Takata area in the city center on elevated ground, he has been struggling with funding the construction of a building that would accommodate his home and a new store.
 For the past nine years, the man and his family have been tossed left and right having to relocate due to the government’s reconstruction project.
 A year after the triple meltdowns at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant following the tsunami, he opened a barber shop close to the place where he used to operate. But he was forced to relocate after the government came up with a plan to elevate the entire area.
 “I had never imagined that I would spend so much time in a temporary housing,” he said. “But I hope we’ll be able to settle on a plan for the future and rebuild our house soon.”

 The Fayette County Sports Hall of Fame action mirrors the actions of other area sports Hall of Fames.
 The May 2 Robert “Tick” Cloherty-Western Chapter Banquet has been canceled.
 “The Executive Board of the Robert ‘Tick’ Cloherty-Western Chapter voted unanimously to cancel our Chapter Induction Banquet, scheduled for Saturday evening, May 2nd, 2020,” said Paul Palmer Western Region Senior Vice President. “Those individuals scheduled to be inducted as the Class of 2020 will now comprise our Class of 2021 and will be inducted at the Pittsburgh Sheraton at Station Square on Saturday, April 17th, 2021.
 The Mid Mon Valley All Sports Hall of Fame canceled its June banquet.
 “As we are part of the Pennsylvania State Hall of Fame and particularly close to our Western chapter HOF members like Western PA, Erie, Fayette County, Washington-Greene County, and East Boros, the attached information will indicate the direction we and our fellow sister chapters throughout the state are moving,” Mid Mon Valley All Sports Hall of Fame General Chairman Steve Russell explained. “Our chairman Dennis Stitch has contacted the banquet Hall at St. Spyridon to move the class of 2020 to 2021 third Friday in June which would be the 18th. Mr. Stitch is also moving to inform the Hall of Fame inductees as to the necessity to move the banquet to the next year. Mr Stitch has master of ceremonies Lanny Frattare on board for next year.

“There are still employers out there that are hiring and we are trying to get that information out through our Facebook and website,” said Caron Job, director of the Yuba County One Stop.
 Some of the Yuba-Sutter industries in need of workers include manufacturing, restaurants, box stores, farming and health care professions, with available positions as mechanics and heavy equipment operators to cart runners and people to help facilitate take-out and online orders
 “I just want to encourage people that if they need help with employment and preparing for employment, please call us,” Job said.
 One Stop facilities in the area are temporarily closed to the public during the stay-at-home order. Still, staff members from each facility are working behind the scenes sending newsletters and updating their social media and websites with up-to-date information on job postings.
 Some people don’t have access to those information channels. Job said her team is still putting up fliers in front of the building for job searchers that don’t have internet access.
 “We are in the stages of planning on how to deal with this situation if this continues,” Job said. “We are looking at setting up ways for people to have mock interviews online to help them prepare, as well as to work with them on resumes.”
 Yuba County residents can find available job postings at www.yubacoe.org/onestop or on Facebook (@YubaCountyOneStop). Sutter County residents can find more information at www.sutteronestop.com or on Facebook (@SutterCountyOneStop).

"What it does, it undermines our efforts and the chain of command’s efforts to address this problem and creates a panic, and creates the perception that the Navy is not on the job, the government is not on the job, and it’s just not true,” Modly said.
 He complained that Crozier sent the memo to people outside his chain of command and in a nonsecure, unclassified email. He also said he had concluded that the captain's ability to react professionally was overwhelmed by the virus challenge, "when acting professionally was what was needed most. We do, and we should, expect more from the commanding officers of our aircraft carriers.”
 Earlier this week, Modly told reporters that Crozier would not be relieved of duty for trying to protect his sailors, but left the door open for punishment if the captain leaked the memo to the press. On Thursday, Modly said he had no information to suggest that Crozier leaked the memo to the press.
 He said that if Crozier had communicated only with his leadership and not widely distributed the memo, he would likely still have a job. He took sole responsibility for the decision to fire Crozier, and said he had been under no pressure from the White House to do so.
 Democrats on the House committee issued a joint statement in support of Crozier. They said that while the captain went outside his chain of command, the pandemic presents a new set of challenges.
 "Captain Crozier was justifiably concerned about the health and safety of his crew, but he did not handle the immense pressure appropriately,” the lawmakers said. "However, relieving him of his command is an overreaction.”
 Sen. Jack Reed, top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he told Modly that Navy leaders must make it clear that the decision to fire Crozier doesn't inhibit others from taking steps to protect their sailors and Marines.
 He said the incident "raised critical questions” about the navy's strategy to combat the virus across the fleet.
 In his memo, Crozier warned that the ship was facing a growing outbreak of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and sought permission to isolate the bulk of his crew members onshore — an extraordinary move that would have involved taking a carrier out of duty in an effort to save lives.
 He wrote that removing all but 10 percent of the crew would be a "necessary risk” in order to stop the spread of the virus.
 "We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset, our sailors,” said Crozier.
 As of Thursday, the navy said 31 percent of the USS Theodore Roosevelt crew have been tested for the virus and that 114 had tested positive. The 180 Sailors that tested negative so far will move into Guam hotels for quarantine. As testing continues, the ship will keep enough sailors on board to sustain essential services and sanitize the ship in port.

Howard, who is a Uniontown native and Jefferson-Morgan graduate, would have competed in his last collegiate wrestling matches in the national tournament, as he was the third seed at 125 pounds, but had to leave the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and fly back home as his career came to an unprecedented end.
 He finished his senior season at 27-2 and was eighth place in the national tournament last season. Howard transferred to Pitt-Johnstown from Clarion University during the second semester of his sophomore year.
 “We had gone through an entire season and worked to get to this level, and then, we can’t wrestle the last two days,” Howard said. “You are not able to get closure on your career as a wrestler. It is also tough for the underclassmen that were here because you never know what will happen down the road in their careers.”
 One of those underclassmen for UPJ was freshman and Hopewell graduate Jacob Ealy, who was the top seed at 141.
 “He definitely had a chance to win a title after winning the super regional tournament,” said Howard of Ealy. “You hope that he can get back to the national tournament, and I know he will do everything he can to get back, but you just never know what will happen in this sport. You just can’t take anything for granted.”
