The Baltimore Ravens are coming off of a special season, but they are hoping 2020 is even better. While Lamar Jackson won the MVP award by leading the NFL's most explosive offense and the Ravens went a league-best 14-2 in the regular season, they fell to the Tennessee Titans in their first playoff game -- which naturally left a sour taste in their mouth after such a magical year. If anything, the Ravens learned that nothing is given to you in the postseason, and that they will have to follow through if they truly want to win a championship.
 Baltimore's offense and the defense are both returning plenty of starters, and one could even argue that the Ravens got better on paper this offseason. While Baltimore did trade for Calais Campbell to boost the defensive line, the Ravens also put together one of the more underrated draft classes. They picked up several intriguing offensive weapons that could help Jackson move the ball down the field in his third season, and also selected two linebackers who should come in and start right away. So, the question has to be asked: Could the Ravens be even better in 2020?
 It will be hard for Baltimore to match its 14-2 record in 2020, but they do have a great chance to clinch the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC. Even more importantly, I think this team has a better shot this year to win the Super Bowl. Let's take a look at three reasons why the Ravens will be the next team to hoist the Lombardi trophy.
 ## 1\. The best rushing attack in the league has improved
 The Ravens rushing attack played a key factor in making them the best team in the regular season last year. They averaged 206 rushing yards per game and rushed for a total of 3,296 yards -- both of which ranked first in the NFL -- and they had two rushers go over 1,000 yards. Jackson racked up 1,206 yards on the ground and seven touchdowns while Mark Ingram recorded his first-ever 1,000-yard season -- rushing for 1,018 yards and adding 10 touchdowns. They weren't the only rushers Baltimore relied on, however. Gus Edwards rushed for 711 yards and five touchdowns and rookie Justice Hill did his part as well, rushing for 225 yards and two touchdowns. With Hill being only 22, I expect him to play more of a role in the offense in his second season, plus the Ravens added yet another running back this year who could end up being the best on roster.

 SHANGHAI, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Proposed U.S. export curbs on SMIC threaten to derail China's nascent but growing domestic semiconductor supply chain, and also hit American and Japanese companies who count the Chinese chipmaker as an important customer.
 Reuters reported on Friday that the Trump Administration was considering barring U.S. companies from supplying goods and services to SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp), China's biggest chipmaker.
 SMIC shares plunged more than 22% on Monday before recovering only slightly, by 3%, on Tuesday.
 The planned curbs come at a time when SMIC had been expected to more than double its spending this year to make higher-end chips, helped by $6.6 billion in funds from a secondary share listing in July and support from state firms.
 But analysts said the proposed restrictions would prevent American suppliers, such as Applied Materials, Lam Research Co and KLA Corp, from selling manufacturing machinery to SMIC and thereby prevent it from making advanced chips.
 Companies like Netherlands-based ASML, and Japan's Tokyo Electron and Advantest, might also restrict sales to SMIC if their governments follow a U.S. move.
 The planned curbs could hit China's chip industry across the board.
 SMIC filings say 65% of its revenue comes from Hong Kong and mainland China. Along with Huawei, it produces comparatively low-tech chips for a bevy of little-known Chinese firms.
 Analysts said only one Chinese-owed chipmaker, Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd, had the requisite know-how to absorb lost capacity from SMIC. As a result, most Chinese chip vendors would be forced to turn to the local factories of foreign manufacturers, most notably Taiwan's TSMC and UMC.
 "If SMIC can't get access to U.S. technology, China will face an even harder, and maybe an impossible, climb to the cutting edge in semiconductors," Kevin Allison, director of research firm Eurasia Group, wrote in a note.
 The proposed SMIC restrictions also raised the possibility that Washington might target China's other chipmakers, which include Hua Hong, Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd, Changxin Memory Technologies Co Ltd.
 President Donald Trump spoke of a "decoupling" of the U.S. and Chinese economies on Monday.
 SUPPLY SHOCKWAVES
 The proposed U.S. curbs on SMIC could deal a blow to manufacturing machinery providers, like American firms Applied Materials, Lam Research and KLA, and Japan's Tokyo Electron.
 Aside from denting their current sales and service business, they could rob them of the opportunities presented by SMIC's expansion plans.
 However this is unlikely to benefit rival chip equipment suppliers in China as none can fill the shoes of the more advanced foreign players, analysts say.
 However some Chinese suppliers were making advances. The likes of Naura Technology Group Co Ltd and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc (AMEC), for example, were expected to become big equipment providers to SMIC in the years to come, but that future could now be under threat.
 "One may think Chinese equipment and material suppliers would be further boosted due to de-Americanisation, which may be true in the long-term, but if SMIC's production lines are paralyzed, these Chinese equipment/materials would be of no use," wrote CLSA analyst Bin a research note.
 Naura and AMEC saw their share prices fall 9% and 10.1%, respectively, on Monday.
 Paul Cheng, general manager at Taipei-based brokerage Masterlink Securities, said Taiwan's Winbond Electronics Corp and Macronix International Co Ltd might now be in a position to acquire SMIC's NOR flash memory business. Both companies' share prices rose on Monday.
 However that would run counter to Beijing's desire to boost homegrown chip production. It would also force Chinese chip companies to devote resources to switching foundries - a costly, time-consuming endeavor.
 "It's doable, sure, but not without at least 12 months of work," said one executive at a Chinese chip vendor.
