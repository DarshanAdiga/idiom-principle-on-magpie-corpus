We got to chat with Chris Matthews, host of _Hardball_ on MSNBC, for the cover story of the new _Multichannel News_. _Hardball_ celebrated 20 years on MSNBC Nov. 8. I asked Matthews about his most memorable guest. He said Donald Trump, before he was president. He describes a version of Trump one might not expect, calling him “vulnerable.”
 “He’s actually a person,” Matthews said. “When you're with him in the room with maybe one other person, he's not some big shot, yelling and pushing his way around the room. It’s different than you'd think.”
 Matthews underwent prostate cancer surgery last month. We spoke before Michael Bloomberg hinted at entering the race for the Democratic nomination. Matthews saw Elizabeth Warren winning out, taking on President Trump, and winning the presidential election.
 Trump is not the candidate he was in 2016, said Matthews. He came into the race “pretty clean” in 2016, despite the _Access Hollywood_ matter alongside Billy Bush. “He looked better. He's getting old. He looks a little rough around the edges. He looks like he's gained weight, all the usual things that happen when you get older,” said Matthews.
 Matthews said he’s had a hard time getting Joe Biden on the program, though Biden did turn up on _Hardball_ back when he was VP. “You wouldn't believe how hard he is to get on the show,” said Matthews. “I guess they have a strategy. It's one thing for him not to do [the shows of] some of my friends, who are a little more skeptical of him than I am. I'm not skeptical, I just want to see him come alive.”

But low demand also means less workers, which is helping keep employees apart.
 At FCA - Brazil's top auto seller when you combine its brands Fiat and Jeep - only 65per cent of its 11,000 workers are going to its factory in Betim, in the state of Minas Gerais. Others are furloughed or work from home.
 After they pass a mandatory health test at home, more than 90per cent of workers get to the factory by taking company buses, said Neylor Bastos, who heads FCA's health operations in Latin America. The company has bought more buses, he said, to ensure the vehicles operate half full for social distancing.
 "At the plant, we have a system that controls worker temperatures," Bastos said. "All people are monitored and if anyone has a temperature over 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit), that person will go straight to the medical facility ... and then goes home."

A few days before May Day, Marcela Mitaynes, a Brooklyn tenant organizer who is running for the New York State Assembly, started getting calls from neighbors she hadn’t heard from in a while. Rent was due, and they were worried about paying. Many were already living paycheck to paycheck before the pandemic. Now, Mitaynes told me in a phone conversation, families who had been depending on two or three incomes were scraping by on one or none. Tenants were worried about sinking into debt—even if they could delay paying for a couple of months, thanks to a temporary moratorium on evictions, they would still owe back rent.

Denise added the whistle to her list of things she can't live without for _The Strategist_. "I know it might sound odd, but if you try it, you'll see that it immediately changes your state of being. It's very calming," Denise told the site. "Anytime I'm feeling stressed out or overwhelmed, it helps ground me. And we could all use that right now, during a time when there's a lot of anxiety and uncertainty."
 While the Lovetuner could be described as a whistle, it's really a single tone flute that makes a sound at 528 Hz. A study published in the _Journal of Genes and Genomics _found that the frequency can induce the production of testosterone and in turn reduce anxiety-related behavior in rats, though this theory has yet to be tested in humans.
 Still, designers of the Lovetuner claim it can reduce stress and anxiety within seconds and is meant as a tool for practicing mindfulness through deep breathing exercises.
 To use it, you simply pull the Lovetuner out of its cap and gently blow into it to create a smooth, long note--not like the type of whistling you'd hear from, say, a crossing guard. After you finish exhaling through the whistle, you should then exhale through your nose before beginning another "tuning cycle."
 The whistle comes with a strap, so that you can hold around your neck, or you can keep it tucked away in your purse.
 Though it's celebrity-approved, you won't have to break the bank to enjoy the experience of a Lovetuner. You can get one for yourself for just $59. Worth it? You tell us.

_Mad About You_ , which aired on NBC from 1992 to 1999, is back with new episodes for Charter subscribers. Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt reprise their roles, as Paul and Jamie Buchman. Six episodes go live Nov. 20, on demand for subscribers, and six more turn up Dec. 18.
 Buchman daughter Mabel is off to college--NYU, in fact, which is walking distance from the family apartment. After dropping Mabel off at school, Mom and Dad turn up at her dorm room frequently in the pilot, driving her nuts.
 Peter Tolan is the showrunner. He did not work on the original _Mad About You_. “I didn’t watch the show much, but I remembered it being good," said Tolan, whose credits include _Rescue Me_ and _The Larry Sanders Show_. “I thought to myself, I think I know how to write for Paul. That intrigued me. Sometimes you get a sense that you could write for a person, or you can’t.”
 Sony Pictures Television produces the show for Spectrum Originals in association with Comedy Dynamics. All 164 original episodes are available free on-demand for subscribers.
 Tolan starting asking around on the set and in the writers’ room, about which episodes he should watch as he got ready to produce the reboot. He heard from a few people that he had to watch the Thanksgiving episode in season three, where Jamie ends up pitching the turkey out the window.
 Tolan said Sony did not find a partner network for the reboot right away, a number of networks saying they already had a reboot in the works. “They ran up against a lot of that stuff,” said Tolan, who added that he was surprised a legacy show such as _Mad About You_ did not find a taker right away.
 Plenty of the _Mad About You_ fans are not Spectrum/Charter subscribers. One, named JR, commented on the B+C site: “Sucks for the many of us who loved this show back in the day and got all excited to watch this then learned it was only for a limited audience with a certain cable company that isn’t available to everyone. Really? Ugh.”
 Tolan is hoping for what he calls a “second window” that will allow non- subscribers to watch the new episodes. Last week, a spokesperson said only Charter subs can watch at this time.
 What is Tolan watching for fun? Like many out there, HBO’s _Succession_. “I’m a horrible fan, it’s disgusting,” he said.
 Season two of _Succession_ ended Oct. 13. The following Sunday, Tolan said he parked himself in front of his TV and its blank screen, just as he’d done on the 10 Sundays before.
 “I’m hurting,” he said.

"By incorporating our jumper into these designs, these robots could navigate safely through uncharted landscapes."
