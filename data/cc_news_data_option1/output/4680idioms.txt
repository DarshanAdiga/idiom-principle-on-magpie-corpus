This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Banks - Northeast space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 48 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.

The Kougars finished their history making season with a 9-2 overall record. We hosted three playoff games and made the semi-final round, both a first for Kadoka Area, and I believe the nine wins is the most in a single season as well. The seniors were a part of four straight seasons of playoff football. We fell just a little short of a big goal and dream making it to the championship game, but these young men really did WIN THE SEASON. They played amazing football, and they did things the right way on and off the field. They really did things ALL IN all season long! We want to thank the school and community for all of the support this season, and I personally want to thank each and every one of the players and assistant coaches for such an awesome year! What a team! What a season! Thank you all!

While Rutgers lost its games against Indiana and Ohio State, it also lost to the worst team in the Big Ten last week, Illinois, and are 1-3. While the loss certainly hurts Rutgers, the team isn't the pushover it once was. Michigan shouldn't overlook the Scarlet Knights and focus on Penn State, the opponent next week. Michigan needs to treat Rutgers as a threat. Michigan's season hasn't already been up to par, and a loss to the Scarlet Knights would amplify the distress that the team is having in Ann Arbor.

About two weeks before the release of _A Deeper Understanding,_ The War On Drugs played this special "micro show" for a Twin Cities radio station that functions as an almost "unplugged" performance. While still technically electric, this brief but exceedingly lovely set is about as stripped back as they ever get. (At one point, Granduciel promises that "we'll have a few more pieces of gear" when the band returns to the area for a regular concert a few months later.) The vibe is mellow and introspective, a far cry from the "big rock" sound of the _Deeper Understanding_ tour. But this proves ideal for that album's ballads — the breathtaking take of "You Don't Have To Go" is my all- time favorite version of that song — as well as their cover of Warren Zevon's "Accidentally Like A Martyr," which also appears on _Live Drugs._

But then, the actor probably has a lot of free time on his hands. While many film productions are back to work to one degree or another, everything is moving slower than it used to. And Jack Black himself has made noises about retiring, so he's probably not looking to get in front of a camera anytime soon. Even if there was a project that might get him working again, like a new _Jumanji_ movie, we don't know when or even if that project is coming, Dwayne Johnson has a number of other movies in the pipeline so even if a new _Jumanji_ is in the cards, it likely won't be happening for a while.

This gig is also noteworthy for Drugsheads because it includes the most memorable performance of the Grateful Dead's "Touch Of Grey," which regrettably exited their repertoire not long after.

Carter, meanwhile, had made the Tastemakers list for being a "forward-thinking traditionalist" and "a tireless advocate for well-crafted yet unfussy beer," according to the magazine. "It's made her a go-to source for beer history and a leader for its future."
 So Baskerville was a little nervous when he called Carter, in part because he wanted to find a style that would align with both brewery's ways of doing things; "they are very traditional and I am a lot more freestyle in my approach," he says. But Carter quickly agreed to get on board.
 The result is a schwarzbier (a dark lager) that both breweries will tap in early December in honor of Weathered Souls' fourth anniversary. It was brewed in San Antonio in October with Beirstadt's house yeast and some lagering tricks and techniques that Carter and Bierstadt co-owner/brewer Bill Eye brought with them the road trip, as well as chocolate rye and other ingredients that suited Baskerville's non-traditional ethos.
 "It got her out of her realm, and it was a learning experience for me. I want to implement some of their lagering processes into my own lagers," he says. "Really, it was one of the highlights of my brewery career so far because I think very highly of their brewery."
