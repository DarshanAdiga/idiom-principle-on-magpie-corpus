And here you are mixing politics into a thread about culture change. And, as Peracles noted upthread, you are one to promote discussions of who can wear braids and who can't, while Rome burns, long threads arguing about who can wear braids instead of voter suppression and bias in the legal system. This is what introducing culture wars into the political realm does: not just distraction but distraction and divisiveness over things that can't be changed by politics or law. Trump is expert at this. Left culture warriors enable his distraction. He jumps on anything cultural he can, every day, whatever is in the news.

FORT WALTON BEACH -- The phone call comes to Tom Rice every year, and usually just a few days before Christmas.


   


  On the other end is a representative from the Salvation Army, where Rice is Community Advisory Board chairman in Okaloosa and Walton counties, or from one of the Salvation Army's fundraising partners.


   


  "It's usually something like 'Hey, an anonymous donor just came through for us in a big way,' or something along those lines," said Rice, who owns Magnolia Grill in Fort Walton Beach. "And we know it's Doc, but we never shared that with anybody without his permission ... but we always know it's him.


   


  "We've known him as a friend, customer and donor to the Empty Stocking Fund for a long time ... but it's deeper than that. There's so much more to it."


   


  When it comes to Niceville's Dr. Gerald Hollingsworth, the 2019 Daily News Person of the Year, it is deeper than that. And there is so much more to the story than just a list of the organizations and people he's helped over decades and decades.


   


  That includes the Empty Stocking Fund, a local assistance program facilitated by the Northwest Florida Daily News and administered by the Salvation Army of Fort Walton Beach. Hollingsworth has given $25,000 each of the last three years, and each time in the days leading up to Christmas.


   


  At the heart of all of this -- all of the giving back, all of the selflessness -- are the memories of an impressionable boy growing up in tiny Centreville, Mississippi.


   


  'We took care of each other'


   


  Before he was a renowned doctor and businessman, Hollingsworth was just a boy growing up in rural Mississippi who needed to learn how to tie his shoes.


   


  Hollingsworth's best guess is that his father didn't continue his formal education past the second or third grade, when he was pressed into full-time work on the family farm.


   


  He worked blue-collar jobs his entire life -- mainly for the department of transportation and away from home. That left Hollingsworth's care and upbringing almost entirely to his mother, Irma, older sister Ida Jo and younger sister, Billie Nell, and vice versa.


   


  "My older sister taught me how to tie my shoes and comb my hair and do all the things little boys need to do," Hollingsworth said. "Then I helped my little sister along. That's just how it worked ... my sisters were always very sweet and very good to me. We took care of each other, and my mother and sisters were always very, very special to me."


   


  Two things from Hollingsworth's childhood would serve as bedrocks for what would become a lifetime of philanthropy.


   


  The first was a visit to the family's home in rural Mississippi from Salvation Army workers in the late 1930s.


   


  "The Salvation Army helped our family when I was a child," Hollingsworth said. "They provided food and clothing and shoes ... and I remember that vividly. I've always thought that was the very best charity, not only for what they do for the community but for the their stewardship. I don't know (a charity) that's better in that regard."


   


  Three decades ago, the Okaloosa County Salvation Army was operating out of a decrepit old church Rice said was "being held together by paint and stucco and falling down around our ears," and was in desperate need of a move.


   


  This year, the Salvation Army will make the final mortgage payments on its current location. When Rice went through the paperwork that made the move possible three decades ago, he found Hollingsworth's name all over it.


   


  "He used his influence, even back then, to get the ball rolling on a new location," Rice said. "He was on committees, he helped come up with plans ... and he continues to help us to this day. We hope we can influence people like he has, and we hope people working with us today can see that. For what he's done and the way he's helped others, he's my role model. That's the truth."


   


  The second thing in Hollingsworth's childhood that influenced his giving gives some insight into the motivation behind work he's done to help the local Special Olympics.


   


  "I've never really talked to anybody about this before, but my mother's younger sister, Alpha, had Down syndrome," Hollingsworth said. "She was always so happy and always wanting to be part of the crowd and whatever the family was doing ... and we all just loved her so much and wanted to take care of her as much as we could."


   


  The first Special Olympics charter in Florida was established in Okaloosa County in 1970 by Dr. Charlie McFarland.


   


  "In the early 1970s, Fort Walton Beach did not have many doctors," McFarland said. "My friend, Dr. Hollingsworth, generously provided physicals for the athletes. He was one of my first volunteers."


      


  'The best financial decision I ever made'


   


  It's a cold, hard truth that Hollingsworth wouldn't have been able to give back like he has over the years, financially, without cold, hard cash.


   


  Early on, as a doctor with a growing family practice, the money was good enough that he was able to give back to Ole Miss, where he'd done his undergrad work, and to Harvard, where he'd learned to practice medicine.


   


  "I felt an obligation to Ole Miss, because they took kind of an awkward, insecure, self-conscious young guy and gave him enough of an education to be accepted at Harvard Medical School," Hollingsworth said. "I don't think I looked at it as philanthropy back then ... it was more like paying off a debt. But I realized how good it made me feel that I could help other people or kids in need of an education, and I started to get more involved in giving back to other places."


   


  Hollingsworth's capacity to give took a giant leap forward when he returned to Fort Walton Beach in 1968 after a one-year stint doing volunteer medical work during the Vietnam War.


   


  While in Vietnam, Hollingsworth drove a Toyota Toyopet Master -- the first car manufactured by the Japanese to be sold in America.


   


  "I was driving that Toyota for a year and I was always blown away by how reliable, thrifty and economical it was," he said. "It took me over all these dirty, dusty roads everywhere I went, and always got me back home. When I came back, the nation was in a gas crisis and everybody was trying to unload all these V8 (engine) cars and gas guzzlers, so it gave me an idea."


   


  Hollingsworth wrote to Toyota and asked if they were going to put a dealership in Fort Walton Beach or anywhere in the area, and if not he'd like to discuss opening one.


   


  Toyota responded by saying they were going to send one of their representatives to Florida to meet with Hollingsworth face-to-face.


   


  "I don't know if that just shows how desperate they were at the time or what," Hollingsworth said, laughing. "But it ended up being the best business financial decision I ever made."


   


  For an investment of approximately $15,000 -- "parts, tools and a sign" -- and a bank credit to buy inventory, Hollingsworth's dual careers as a doctor practicing family medicine and owning an auto dealership were underway.


   


  In 2014, a Houston-based private equity firm, ZT Wealth, spent $80 million to buy Quality Motors, which encompassed Hollingsworth's Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Mazda stores. That included a $43 million "blue sky offer" to Hollingsworth.


   


  "With the money I made from the car dealership, I was able to get more involved with things like Salvation Army and Special Olympics and the All Sports (Association) Banquet," Hollingsworth said. "And especially when I sold it, I had available funds to give to all the organizations I wanted to help, and that includes Northwest Florida State (College)."


   


  'Appreciate what people have done for you'


   


  It's not clear exactly how much Hollingsworth has given back over the years, nor would he disclose that number, but there are several high-profile examples of his largesse.


   


  Most notably, his 2015 gift to Ole Miss Athletics of $25 million was the largest gift in the history of the athletic department. The Rebels play their home games at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on Hollingsworth Field.


   


  In 2018, he donated $500,000 to the Ole Miss Women's Council to establish the Ida Jo Gallant OMWC Scholarship Endowment and the Billie Nell Jensen OMWC Scholarship endowment to support incoming freshmen with "proven academic ability and leadership potential."


   


  He also helped found the All Sports Assocation in Northwest Florida, was on the Okaloosa Island Authority when it had the fishing pier built and spent years volunteering as a football team doctor for Choctaw High.


   


  Hollingsworth won't say much about his donations over the years or his late saves on the Empty Stocking Fund other than "I like to wait until the end to see how close we are" and is more prone to try and bring the names of others who also volunteered and donated into the limelight.


   


  "If you don't appreciate what other people have done for you, I don't feel like you probably don't have a lot of character or integrity," Hollingsworth said. "And I feel like I've been the most fortunate guy on God's green earth in that regard. I know the joy I've received from giving back.


   


  "I think the Bible says something along the lines of, 'If you give back, you shall be rewarded tenfold.' That satisfaction and enjoyment I feel when I realize I've helped other people that needed the same kind of help I did when I was young ... it's something you can't really quantify."

A Saskatoon judge has ordered that a Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission investigation into former Remai Modern CEO Gregory Burke be stayed because of "unreasonable" delays.


  The investigation started after a former employee of Burke's made a complaint in 2015 alleging that Burke discriminated against her and harassed her because she is a woman.


  Burke applied to have the investigation halted this fall, citing the unusually long process that far exceeded the commission’s stated timelines as well as damage done to his professional reputation and health.


  Under the commission's timeline, mediation on a complaint is supposed to be completed in 90 days, and the investigation is supposed to be finished in a further 180 days.


  According to court documents, the SHRC has acknowledged the four-year-plus investigation "has taken longer than most," but that proceedings have been "complex."


  In a decision released on Dec. 31, Justice Brenda Hildebrandt said she considers the delay in Burke's case "inordinate and therefore an abuse of process," but fell short if finding there had been vexatious, frivolous or abusive conduct. She ordered that proceedings related to Burke be stayed.


  The decision further states that the delay "caused significant prejudice" to Burke, noting it caused him psychological and medical harm, a "direct loss of employment" and, following that, an ongoing problem finding any new employment.


  Burke had originally left his position at the Remai Modern to take a job to lead the Aukland Art Gallery in his hometown in New Zealand, though he was forced to withdraw from the position when news of the complaint became public in March.


  "Of course it's frustrating," he said in a telephone interview with the StarPhoenix in November. "There is a process for these things and, by and large, they're usually done in confidence. But the release of my name without any details obviously allowed people all around the world to speculate and maybe interpret the situation incorrectly."


  Burke could not be reached for comment Tuesday.


  A spokesperson for the SHRC said the commission will be reviewing the decision.

Your victimhood narrative is simply not the reality of things, you are trying to spin a situation negatively instead of being happy and proud it's your time you whine and have an obsession with old times as if you wish they were back so you could continue an old fight which you romanticize and find glamorous and inspiring, almost as if you miss being part of a powerless underclass. _Your glass is half full, not half empty in the history of things, opportunity abounds_. Trump is president by electoral fluke of resentment from a minority BECAUSE OF your tribal cultural success. Your constant negativity is shocking in light of what we all know is going on in the culture.

Whatever hating you experience now, others get as well, the world is never going to be free of Teds and never has been free of haters. Let sleeping dogs lie, take advantage of your moment in the sun, be proud of it and stop the victimhood obsession. Better to show the successes, like President Barack Obama first Lady Michelle Obama being the most popular woman in the world and black medical students posing on the site of former slaves. Victimhood thing simply strikes as ridiculous in context of what is going on in world culture. What's happening to Afro-American culture is the opposite of what is happening to Uighur culture.
