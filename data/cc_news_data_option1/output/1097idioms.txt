TWO weeks ago I met up with Carlos – a Noosa business owner who proudly shared with me the pride and passion he has for the many successful restaurants he runs.
 Six in fact.
 Besides his generosity and great coffee, what shone through for me from our time together was that he had his finger on the business pulse.
 I’m sure Carlos would be running the country’s finances if he wasn’t so good at running businesses.
 From wages to taxes, rent to advertising costs, this guy was across every aspect of every single one of his businesses.
 Someone could sneeze in one of his restaurants and he would know about it.
 But not even Carlos could have predicted what was to come.
 None of us could.
 The coronavirus has brought the whole planet to its knees.
 Living in a time of unprecedented uncertainty is scary.
 And that fear is coming from a 40-year-old, somewhat healthy bloke with a relatively stable income and a 16-year old son who knows everything and is too cool to be scared of anything.
 Even on a journalist’s wage, I’m one of the lucky ones.
 One can only imagine the impact this worldwide pandemic is having on the aged and frail or those with young families.
 Or how the social ban is affecting those hardworking businesspeople who rely on a steady flow of foot traffic to pay the bills or struggling musicians whose only form of income is from punters who turn up to their gigs.
 Even blind Freddy can see we are in troubled times.
 And according to the authorities the seas don’t look like calming anytime soon.
 So what does that mean for you and me?
 I mean no disrespect, but I think there are some positives to come out of this pandemic.
 From all reports, our flora, fauna and environment are loving this chance to ‘recover.’
 I guess that is bound to happen when a few billion people give the planet a rest.
 A break from social interaction means more time to spend with family.
 I’ve spent a lot more time with mine the last couple of days.
 They seem like nice people.
 It also means more time to spend with yourself.
 Without sounding all peace, love and mung beans I’ve enjoyed listening more closely and intently to my thoughts.
 I’m happy to announce most of them are relatively sane.
 As Aussies, we pride ourselves on being a pretty resilient and caring bunch.
 We are always there to lend a hand when the chips are down for our mates.
 Now, more than ever is our chance to really show it.
 Ring your Nanna and make sure they’re doing OK and do some shopping for the old bloke down the road.
 These previously unseen events are a great opportunity to reignite your sense of community.
 Or have it sparked for the first time as it has for this little black duck.
 Most importantly, relax.
 As my mum always says; it is all going to be OK, whatever happens.
 And it’s true, it’ll be OK.
 As a nation, it’s important we take a breath.
 Go about your normal day sensibly and look out for one another.
 For me, I’m off to see my mate Carlos to enjoy a double shot flat white. Cheers.

New efforts to thin population densities included a move by New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania to order the closings of all shopping malls beginning at 8 p.m. Thursday.
 "It is critical that we remain on the same page as our neighboring states, and so far we are the only region in the country partnering to create uniform, regional density reduction policies that prevent 'state shopping,'" Cuomo said.
 He added: "We will continue working together to update our regulations and guidance as the situation evolves while keeping a consistent standard across the region."
 As for the workforce reduction order, Cuomo said it does not apply to essential services, such as grocery stores, health care facilities, pharmacies, transportation and banks and other financial institutions. Also exempt are media companies, utilities and warehouse operations.
 Cuomo said his administration crafted the new restrictions after consulting with the Retail Council and the Business Council of New York State.
 A similar directive was imposed on municipal governments across the state, requiring local governments to reduce staffing in public buildings. Gyms, movie theaters, bars and restaurants have also been closed indefinitely, though restaurants can sell takeout.
 The firms being impacted by the new directive have the option of letting workers telecommute.
 The governor predicted the directives from New York and similar steps taken by other state will have economic impacts.

Then again, I've personally never liked watching things in big groups, because I always end up being the only person who's fuming in the corner about not being able to hear what's going on while everyone else is laughing and chatting it up around me. (If you're going to have people over to watch something, then actually _watch_ the thing, damn it! Sorry, I'm a buzzkill.) I'd be fully on board with this if you could convince your friends to watch something you've already seen; then you could laugh, joke, and GIF your way through it worry-free. But again, these are weird times, so maybe it's worth having that live digital connection with your friends since you can't hang with them in person. I suppose you could always go back to catch up with a scene later if you missed something. In any case, you can learn more about Netflix Party by visiting its official website.

Though student protests over the issue have roiled Pomona, the process has unfolded more smoothly at neighboring Claremont McKenna College, a fellow member of the five-campus Claremont Colleges.
 Among 1,184 Claremont McKenna students living in campus housing, about 200 petitioned to stay and about 85 received approval to do so. That included all international student applicants, who face potential health risks and visa problems if they leave the country, said Dianna Graves, assistant vice president and dean of students.
 Graves said the top concern of those who petitioned to stay involved technology. The college was able to meet those needs by providing enhanced internet and data plans, loaner laptops and iPads, connections via virtual private network and other services, Graves said.
 At Pepperdine University in Malibu, about 1,000 students requested permission to continue living on campus. About 200 will do so, more than half of them international students. University officials were able to help the other students get home safely by providing financial support from donor gifts for flights and gas — or a safe place to live temporarily, said Connie Horton, vice president for student affairs.
 At Pomona, school officials said in a statement that they are “working with students around the clock to help find housing and travel options for the move off-campus.”
 The school says it will continue to pay student employees, help cover travel costs, offer Wi-Fi hot spots and laptops, and provide room and board refunds for students, moves that other private colleges have made nationwide.
 But some say those efforts fall short of addressing the outbreak response’s effect on students who must return home and come from poverty, abuse or other risky situations. And they say school officials have not offered them clear communication and guidance.
 Student advocates with the group FLI Scholars, the acronym for first- generation and low-income students at Pomona College, surveyed 135 students who petitioned to stay. The self-reported data indicate that 70% were denied, they said. School officials did not respond to questions about how many students had applied to stay and how many were accepted or rejected.

 Cuomo's announcement came after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. and Canadian governments have jointly decided to suspend crossings of the U.S. border with Canada. That directive pertains to all "non-essential" traffic and, according to Trump, will not impact international trade.
 To address consequences virus-related quarantines and workforce reductions are having, Cuomo signed measures Wednesday night that allow workers to get paid leave if they have to miss work due to the pandemic and qualify them for immediate jobless benefits should they be laid off.
 While the bulk of New York's infections are in the downstate region, there were fresh indications it has been transmitted to people in rural upstate New York.
 Counties that previously did not have a person infected by the virus but do now include: Chenango, Essex, Hamilton, Warren and Washington, according to state data.
 While the state did not mention Niagara County in the updated data, the Niagara Gazette, quoting Niagara County officials, has confirmed that one person from Niagara County has now tested positive for the virus.
 Meanwhile, officials said a resident of the town of Cobleskill in Schoharie County is being treated for a COVID-19 infection.
 The first upstate resident to die from the virus was identified as an employee of Rochester General Hospital. A local television station, WHEC, identified the man as Alvin Simmons, 54, who had worked in the hospital's housekeeping department for less than a month.
 Cuomo said the increase in the number of infected people reflects an increase in the availability of tests for the virus.
 Cuomo also said Trump has arranged for a Navy hospital ship, the U.S. Comfort, which is equipped to treat at least 200 patients, to assist New York's effort by mooring the vessel in New York Harbor.

Surely there's some animosity between the brothers based on how each of them chooses to worship. Lessons will likely have to be learned in order to make peace with each other and God.

After all, a lot of the mega churches out there with big bands, multimedia services, and an impersonal touch have been mocked by smaller religious communities for a long time now, so it only makes sense that there would be a movie made to remind everyone of a lesson about how it doesn't matter how you pray.
