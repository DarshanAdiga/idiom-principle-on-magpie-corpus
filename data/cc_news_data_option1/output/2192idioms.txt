Today's numbers are a clear step in the right direction for the US labour market. There is still a long way to go, though, with payroll employment and hours worked both 13% below their pre-crisis levels. It remains the case that 3/4 of unemployed persons are on temporary layoff, and that should ease the transition back to work as health restrictions continue to be eased. We're likely to see more strong jobs data in the coming months, though we think it will take a long time for the labour market to fully recover from the coronavirus shock. We expect the unemployment rate will remain elevated (but not in the double digits) by the end of this year, which should keep policymakers in stimulus mode.

The road to the NHL for a goalie is hardly hearts and flowers.
 OK, for Carter Hart it has been.
 The 21-year-old Sherwood Park goaltender was a second-round pick of Philadelphia in 2016, went back to his WHL team in Everett for two seasons where he stood on his head, played just 18 AHL games at Lehigh Valley, and right to the Flyers as their starter.
 Hart has had some bumps along the road, like unfortunately in his first game in his hometown against Edmonton Oilers last fall. But, Hart generally has been excellent in his first two NHL seasons, the fast-lane exception while his friend and Oilers prospect Stuart Skinner, also 21, is the slow-and-steady rule.
 Bide your time in the minors. ECHL, then AHL, then maybe NHL to back-up, then …
 More the Laurent Brossoit Oilers route.
 So in this week's profile of prospects we bring you Skinner, the No. 3 goalie in the organization. He had a 3.31 average and .892 save percentage this past season in Bakersfield. In 2018-2019 in Wichita he had better numbers (3.16 and .903) in the same games.
 "Stuart's got the size, he's got the ability, all the physical tools to be an NHL goaltender. But it's a position where you typically develop later," said Bakersfield Condors coach Jay Woodcroft, who played Skinner 41 of their 56 games this past season before it was cancelled.
 Shane Starrett's groin issues this past year in Bakersfield limited him to 14 games which thrust Skinner into the starter role. The former Air Force Academy star is an unrestricted free-agent who might not get re-signed by the Oilers, in part because he's 26 in July and Skinner, much younger, looks like he could be the 45-50 game No. 1 on the farm this upcoming season.
 Skinner, who'll likely be a farm call-up as one of the Black Aces when the NHL season gets up and running with their playoff format, knows goalies usually take a long time to develop as pros.
 "It's obvious when a goalie makes a mistake and obvious when a goalie makes a good play," said Skinner. "There's a bit more pressure with being a goaltender and how many games you have to play. Knowing your mistakes and successes are out there for the whole world to see."
 The six-foot-three goalie has the frame NHL teams are looking for. Also the quickness.
 "I was grateful to be able to play the games I did this past season … there's a lot of learning. There were lots of ups and down, especially as a team going through a tougher year results wise. Helped me overcome obstacles," he said.
 Skinner wasn't counting on 40 games in the AHL, but Starrett got hurt three games in.
 "I didn't have a ton of expectations going into the season. Knowing the way Shane played the previous year (all-rookie team, second AHL all-star squad), I thought he would take the role (40-plus games) but with the injury, it helped me get comfortable," he said.
 The Oilers used a platoon system in 2019-2020 in net. Koskinen has two years left on his contract; Smith is an unrestricted free-agent at 38, but the Oilers conceivably could want Smith back for another year.
 So, Skinner is biding his time as Brossoit, 27, did before he got a few tastes of the NHL. He was Cam Talbot's back-up here in 2017-2018 but only got into 14 games, and eventually was found wanting. He signed with the Winnipeg Jets .He had a 2.52 average and .925 save percentage last season in 21 games. This season it's 3.28 and .895 in 19 games.
 Skinner admits he sees who's ahead of him.
 "You try not to, but you sometimes look at how they're playing and where they're at in their careers, but it's important to focus on how you're doing and just let things happen," he said.
 Again, there are no guarantees for goalies, no matter where you're drafted.
 "It's different for every person, on and off the ice … depends on who you are and the opportunity you get. If you get that at an earlier age, maybe you're ready for it than if you're more mature," said Skinner, which certainly sounds like Hart.
 "Carter's an unbelievable goaltender. I've played with him and against him growing up here and was able to see him in the WHL and I've seen his hard- work."
 Hart is the exception; Skinner is more than norm.
 Good games, spliced with hard lessons.
 "It is a long road for a goaltender … it's about experience and playing at a high level consistently," said Skinner, doesn't get any debate from Woodcroft of his path.
 "I go back to the 40-odd games he played in the American League this year and the 40 the year before when you figure the East Coast and the American League. He also had to experience three games in a round two playoff series last season (San Diego). That's a good experience level forsuch a young guy," said Woodcroft. "Now, it comes down to finding a way to become an elite goaltender at the American League level. When he can do that and put it altogether it'll be a big step in his development."

Pakistan Cricket Board has announced that wicket-keeper batsman Umar Akmal's appeal against his three-year ban will be heard on June 11 by a former Supreme Court judge Justice. We have seen in the past that controversy and Umar Akmal go hand in hand. For the past several years, Akmal has been involved in a variety of controversial incidents which has led to more talk about his behaviour rather than his cricketing talent. From fitness issues to behavioural incidents and now corruption charges, Akmal has seen it all.
 Now he is facing a ban of three years as he failed to inform PCB about approaches made to him. Then in an observation made by PCB's disciplinary panel, it was said that Akmal did not show remorse nor did he seek an apology for failing to report corrupt approaches.
 Akmal was banned for three-years on April 27 by the PCB's Disciplinary Panel, for not reporting spot fix approaches made to him during the Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches.
 "Notices for the hearing have been issued to Umar Akmal and PCB," the cricket board posted on its website.
 Akmal had filed the appeal against the ban which was imposed after the panel found him guilty of breaching Article 2.4.4 of the PCB Anti-Corruption Code in two separate incidents.
 The spot fixing offers were made to Akmal at two separate parties held in Defence Housing Society Lahore.
 The Disciplinary Panel Chairman Mr Justice (retid) Fazal-e-Miran Chauhan had observed that Akmal was non-cooperative and did not show any remorse.
 The controversial Akmal last played for Pakistan in October, 2019 in a T20 series against Sri Lanka at home.

Another reader, Emily, writes that her “boss intends to apply for the free money (the CEWS) but we will not be working…. Many employers will take the 75 per cent but not pass it on to the employees as they cannot actually operate their business yet.” She wanted to know how she could report her former employer to the CRA.
 On June 1st, the CRA updated its National Leads Program website to advise Canadians that the Leads Program can currently accept leads from Canadians who wish to report suspected fraudulent applications for the CERB or CESB but do not meet the eligibility criteria, as well as businesses or charities that are misusing the CEWS. Prior to the website update, the program had already received more than 600 leads relating to these three benefit programs.
 The Leads Program gives you the opportunity to anonymously report suspected domestic tax evasion online via the website, or by phone, mail, or fax, all while protecting your anonymity. As the CRA does not track the identity of those who submit leads, it’s not able to provide the number of Canadians who have used the program to report suspected domestic tax evasion, nor the dollar amounts assessed related to these leads. The government did confirm, however, that the program receives more than 30,000 annually, and reviews all of them.
 Unfortunately, unlike the Offshore Tax Informant Program (OTIP), which pays monetary rewards of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of the federal tax collected to informants whose leads result in the collection of more than $100,000 of additional federal tax (excluding penalties and interest), there are no monetary rewards handed out for information about suspected cheating under the Leads Program. In the words of the CRA, “When you submit a (domestic) lead, you are supporting your community and the programs and services we all rely on to improve quality of life in Canada.”
 In a normal year, the Leads Program typically has informants reporting on taxpayers who are not declaring all their income, creating false expenses or tax deductions, taking cash “under the table,” setting up a fake business to claim losses and reduce taxes, and falsely claiming tax benefits or credits. For 2020, those false benefits include inappropriate claims for the CERB, the CESB and the CEWS.
 The CRA and Service Canada have records of all individuals who’ve received payments for the CERB and CESB, and are verifying to make sure the payments were correctly allocated. Similarly, various pre-payment verifications and post-payment reviews are being conducted by the CRA for the CEWS. If you suspect a potential misuse of these COVID-19 emergency benefits and programs, the CRA needs some specific details from you depending on which type of benefit you suspect may have been inappropriately claimed.
 For the CERB, the CRA wants you to provide as much detail as you can about the individual’s work situation, their (former) employer and why they may not be eligible. For example, did they earn more than $1,000 in allowable income in the four-week eligibility period? Or perhaps they didn’t earn at least $5,000 in (self-)employment income in 2019 (or the prior 12 months). Are they receiving multiple CERB payments from both the CRA and Service Canada?
 For the CESB, the CRA is asking for information about the student’s schooling situation, graduation, work circumstances (or lack thereof), employer and eligibility. For example, are they an international student? Did they earn more than $1,000 in allowable income in the four-week period?
 For the CEWS, the CRA wants information about the employer (the business name and the legal name), the type of business, the number of employees affected, and whether workers are considered to be employees or subcontractors. While the CRA is encouraging employees to bring any CEWS concerns to their employer first, it seems unlikely that employees, who are either still working or who hope to be rehired by their employer in the future, would confront their own employer about suspected CEWS fraud, for fear of retribution.
 Once you send in a lead, you cannot take it back. If you submit your lead online or by phone, you will be given a reference number and supporting documents you wish to submit can then be sent by mail or fax to the CRA using that reference number. Once received, the CRA will match your supporting documents to the lead you submitted. Examples of helpful documents may include: copies of e-mails with details that help identify the suspected tax or benefit cheat, invoices and/or receipts, cheques, financial statements and bank account numbers.
 Curious if your ex ever got caught? Well, you won’t find out from the CRA. The government won’t provide any feedback or updates after you submit a lead because the CRA is not permitted to disclose personal tax information about other taxpayers to anyone other than the taxpayer and their authorized representative.

Some refer to her as “Zelda the Wonder Dog.”
 They may be right.
 The 6-year-old German shepherd-mix rescue dog escaped from her adopted home residence in Chanhassen on Feb. 6.
 She was captured May 12 outside a residence in Merriam Park area in St. Paul, having somehow survived freezing temperatures, high traffic volume and who knows what else. She even had to cross the Mississippi River.
 “That’s one amazing dog,” said Mike Willis who, with his wife, Susan, noticed the dog outside their home several weeks ago and routinely gave it food and water. “We’re so happy to see how this all ended. We were glad to be a part of it.”
 The distance from where Zelda escaped to where she was found is about 26 highway miles, but she likely covered scores of more miles during the time she was on the run.
 “I never thought I wouldn’t find her or that she wouldn’t be OK,” said Seneca Krueger of St. Paul, who provided foster care for Zelda from mid-August until the dog was adopted out to Chanhassen on Jan. 26.
 “After only about six months, that she would have felt that bonded to this house to try and get back here, that’s amazing,” said Krueger, who lives in the Midway area of St. Paul, only a few minutes from the Willis’ residence. “It’s quite the story.”
 Zelda was rescued from an overcrowded Texas shelter and was initially kept at a different foster residence before bonding with Krueger, who also has a black lab and Great Dane, both over 100 pounds.
 “Zelda was fearful and shut-down at the initial adoption home and never really came out of her shell there,” said Krueger, who’s cared for 30 to 40 dogs and a handful of cats over about 12 years of pet fostering. “The rescue reached out and asked if anyone else could take her in to help get her more trusting. I love the fearful and shut-down dogs, so I offered.”
 Zelda was eventually adopted out to the Chanhassen residence, only to escape.
 Niki Taylor, founder and team leader of the Minnetrista-based START (Search, Track and Retrieval Team), heard about the missing dog and offered assistance, which was accepted.
 Missing dog posters and signs were distributed, and information was posted on a number of social media sites. There were many responses about sightings of Zelda in the Lake Minnewashta and Lake Lucy areas.
 “The community was awesome in letting us know when they saw her,” Taylor said. “There were dozens and dozens of sightings. It was amazing.”
 There were indications that Zelda had at one point returned to the adoption residence off Lake Lucy Road, but she ran off, somehow lost her collar. She was spotted running across frozen Lake Lucy and in late February in the Excelsior area.
 Taylor and others at once had Zelda in their sights along Highway 7 near Excelsior, where she was almost hit by two cars. She got away. She wasn’t seen from Feb. 26 until April 17, but this time it was near St. Mary’s Cemetery in Minneapolis, Taylor said.
 “That’s when we knew she was trying to get back to the foster home in St. Paul,” Taylor said.
 There were multiple more sightings before they got word that the Willises had mentioned on a Next Door website about the stray dog they were feeding.
 “We were pretty certain it was Zelda because of the description,” Taylor said.
 Taylor and Kathy Brunner of C`hanhassen, one of six START team members, set up trail cameras to catch a glimpse of Zelda and had taken overnight shifts to monitor the cameras. A screened trap was also installed at the Willis location.
 At 4:38 a.m. on May 12, Brunner noticed Zelda had been safely secured in the trap.
 “We called Seneca and the homeowners to let them know,” Taylor said. “They were out there next to the trap, trying to keep Zelda calm, when we got there.”
 Because Zelda had lost about 15 pounds and changed color, “from a redhead to a blond,” it was not certain it really was Zelda,” Seneca said.
 It took four readings of the microchip number on the scanner to satisfy Seneca that it really was Zelda.
 “I was pretty shocked and excited, and so happy it was her,” Taylor said. “I turned around and looked at Seneca. She started crying; the homeowners, Kathy, everybody was crying.
 “The reality that she made that who knows how many miles journey from Chanhassen to St. Paul to get back was just amazing,” Taylor added.
 “When Seneca realized it was Zelda, it was much sweeter; very emotional; a really great moment,” Susan Willis said. “It was a definite feel good moment.”
 The Willises, who have dogs of their own, were impressed by the work of Taylor and Brunner and their volunteer service organization in the southwest suburbs, saying they deserve “lots of kudos for what they did in all this.”
 The adopter in Chanhassen agreed to surrender Zelda back to Seneca weeks ago so that Seneca could work with Minneapolis animal control officials on searching for Zelda.
 “There seems to be only one person on this earth that Zelda trusts and that’s me,” Seneca said, also adding her appreciation for the START team’s efforts. “It was priceless to have them go through this with me.”

Pizza is perfect, as everybody knows. It combines all the major food groups — carbs, cheese and weird/savory fruit — to form a paragon of umami, one that is unparalleled by any other comestible. Pizza is perfect eaten hot at lunchtime, throughout the evening or in the staggering late of night; it is also perfection eaten cold, in the morning or thereabouts, standing in front of the fridge like a barbarian. Most pizza is triangular, the ideal aerodynamic shape for shoving into the piehole as well as neat to eat while walking down the street. Even kind-of-bad pizza is pretty good, and great pizza is the second — or at most the third — best thing in life.
 Pizza is especially perfect for these coronavirus times. Pizza by delivery just feels normal, at a time when just feeling normal is singularly marvelous — shout out to Seattle’s Pagliacci, offering adult beverages along with its no-contact pie drop-off, while also supporting other local businesses with special days of cheer-up giveaways of treats like Trophy Cupcakes. Pizza taken to go from our best sit-down spots — Delancey and Dino’s are two of my go-tos — helps us recollect that our world can still contain stellar moments. And making your own pizza is, come to find out, the perfect pandemic hobby (and it also gives you an excuse to eat lots of delivery and takeout pizza, as thorough research is essential).
 Whatever with baking bread — that’s too easy. Making pizza involves bread _and_ sauce _and_ materials science _and_ the fact that your home oven is really probably never going to be quite hot enough. Onward and sideways! Making pizza is a project, and it is fun to try, over and over, getting better every time (with maybe a few glaring exceptions). The pursuit of pizza perfection lends itself to obsession, but, you know, the good kind of obsession rather than waiting with bated breath for the day’s COVID-19 numbers to come in. Making pizza is a journey, which, at least in my case, shows no signs of ever ending.

Rosalía ha participado en el programa especial 'Se agradece' de la televisión mexicana para homenajear a los profesionales sanitarios por la labor que están haciendo para frenar la COVID-19. La cantante catalana, que acaba de estrenar 'TKN' junto a Travis Scott, se ha labrado una buena reputación internacional que hace que todo cartel que lleve su nombre levante un especial interés. Junto a ella este programa especial ha contado también con la colaboración de otros grandes artistas como Alejandro Sanz, David Bisbal, Ana Torroja, Maluma, J. Balvin o Sebastian Yatra. Para esta intervención Rosalía ha escogido 'La Llorona', una canción popular mexicana que Chavela Vargas convirtió en su seña de identidad y que ha vuelto a cobrar especial popularidad en el resto del mundo gracias a la película de Disney 'Coco'. En el programa, presentado por la también cantante Gloria Trevi, Rosalía ha confesado que la música de Chavela Vargas ha estado muy presente en su casa desde que era niña. Ahora, alejada de casa desde su estudio en Miami, donde la cantante se encuentra componiendo el que será su próximo disco y pasando la cuarentena, Rosalía ha cogido con sumo mimo esta canción, de larga tradición y que supone casi un himno para los mexicanos, y le ha aportado su toque añadiendo un poco de autotune a una melodía solemne. Esta versión de 'La Llorona' ha emocionado a todo el mundo. Entre los comentarios, muchos artistas y amigos han plasmado cómo les ha impactado y llegado la magia con la que la reina del Tra-trá ha cantando este tema.

The thing is we are uncharted territory for the current incarnation of the worlds monetary system. Monetary authorities everywhere are in full money printing mode, and all that money has got to go somewhere.      Which would you prefer to have, £1bn in cash in the bank, or some decent sized stakes in actual businesses that will continue to create wealth, regardless of what tokens are used to keep count of the profits? That £1bn might be worth nothing if the bank goes bust, or hyperinflation kicks in once all the printed money reaches down to the mass population, so whats the rational thing to do, if you are a recipient of central bank largesse? Buy hard assets, even if their price might go down 40-50% in the short run in current currency units, or hold cash which could go to zero?

Where we live, June evenings bring fireflies - "lightning bugs" dancing their way across the starry background.      This is a real pleasure of stepping out on a clear night in June. The field we have out back, darkened by the night, would look like a field of stars if those fireflies would stand still. Instead they move about, blinking on and off, a show in my mind coupled with the constellations above, beats any man- made fireworks show.      One night I was looking through my reflecting telescope and a firefly entered through the open end of the tube. You can imagine the distraction!      The stars, though seemingly unchanging and still, looking as they did to our ancestors of old, aren't all that different than the firefly. Like this flashy insect, the stars actually are in constant motion, and many of them "blink" \- mostly at very slow rates (days, weeks, months) as they vary in magnitude.      The stars don't seem to be shifting because they are so immensely far. A few though, are crossing the heavenly sphere at a fast enough clip and are close enough, that a user of even a small telescope could trace its motion over a few years. One of the most famous is Barnard's Star, in Ophiucus.      As darkness falls in mid-June - once the moon is out of the way - look southeast for the large constellations Ophiucus and Serpens. Note: Serpens is broken in two, on either side of Ophiucus.      Ancient Greeks depicted Ophiucus as the renowned physican Aesculapius, the inventor and god of medicine, holding Serpens the Snake across his knees. Ophiucus is also depicted standing on Scorpius the Scorpion, the constellation immediately below it and marked with a fabulous, bright red star, Antares.      Dr. Ophiucus, I don't think, would be recognized by my health insurance plan.      Barnard's Star is of 9.5 magnitude, requiring a telescope of about 3-inch aperture or larger to easily see. You need a detailed star chart showing the myriad of similarly faint stars to track down which one is Barnard's Star.      Although appearing motionless in the eyepiece, if you were to take photographs or very carefully plot the stars on paper, you could repeat this in a few years and see that Barnard's Star has actually moved.      It was discovered by Professor Emerson Bernard in 1916. He noticed it had shifted by comparing his photographic plate with plates taken in 1894 and 1904.      The star has the highest proper motion of any star we see, moving at 10.3 "seconds of arc" per year.      (A degree on the sky, equal to about two full moons, is equivalent to 60 minutes of arc. Each minute has 60 seconds of arc.)      Barnard observed that in 22 years the star moved by four minutes of arc - about a third of the apparent separation of the famous double star Mizar and Alcor in the Big Dipper's handle.      Barnard's Star is a red dwarf star and only six light-years away, among the very closest. Astronomer Peter Van de Kamp, in 1963, had become convinced that an apparent wobble in the star's path was due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet.      His assertion was not vindicated until 2018 when a planet, 3.2 times the size of Earth, was discovered orbiting the star.   Full moon is on June 6.      Keep looking up at the sky!

The NBA has told the National Basketball Players Association that it will present a 22-team plan for restarting the season to the league’s board of governors on Thursday, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press.
 The teams that will be going to the ESPN Wide World Of Sports complex on the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida, would play eight games to determine playoff seeding starting around July 31 before the postseason begins, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the league has not released its proposal publicly.
 The plan, once approved, would have 13 Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams going to Disney, and the cutoff being that teams must be within six games of a playoff spot at this point. Playoffs would start in August, and the NBA Finals will likely stretch into October, the person said.
 The Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics already have clinched playoff spots — and, if only eight games are left, that would mean the Miami Heat, Indiana Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston Rockets would theoretically have clinched spots as well.
 The Dallas Mavericks would be virtually assured of clinching a West spot, holding a seven-game lead over eighth-place Memphis. That would mean the Grizzlies, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix all would be in the running for the No. 8 seed out West. In the East, Washington is six games behind No. 7 Brooklyn and 5 1/2 games behind No. 8 Orlando — so within range of triggering a play-in series.
 “I’m all in from the state’s perspective,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference Wednesday in central Florida. “I don’t think you could find a better place than Orlando to do this. I think it’s very exciting.”
 DeSantis met by phone with NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum on Tuesday. The governor also said the state helped with the plans to make a golf match last month featuring Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning — one that raised $20 million for coronavirus relief — happen. And Major League Soccer announced Wednesday a plan to restart its season in Orlando.
 “Orlando really could be the epicenter of the comeback of professional sports,” DeSantis said.
 For an NBA play-in series to happen to determine the No. 8 seed on either playoff bracket, the ninth-place team would have to be within four games of eighth place once the eight-game schedule of lead-in games is completed. If a play-in series occurs, it would basically be a best-of-two — where the No. 9 seed would have to win two head-to-head matchups to take over the No. 8 spot.
 There also would be some jostling for playoff positioning happening in the eight-game restart. In the East, Toronto and Boston are separated by three games for the No. 2 spot, and Miami, Indiana and Philadelphia are separated by two games for the No. 4 spot. Out West, the Clippers, Denver, Utah, Oklahoma City and Houston are all within four games of one another in the race for the No. 2 seed on that bracket.
 There are still some elements of the restart plan that could be changed, and other matters are still being negotiated — such as how much of a percentage of their salaries players will lose because some regular-season games will be canceled. If 15% of the regular season is not played, which would be the current estimate based on the proposal, players would have to give up roughly $610 million in salary for this season.
 It's also unclear what will happen to the eight teams that would not be vying for a postseason berth under the proposed format — Charlotte, Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, New York, Cleveland, Minnesota and Golden State. If the 2020-21 NBA season doesn't start until December at the earliest, which would seem to be a very real possibility, those teams could go about nine months without playing games, and some have expressed concerns over what that will mean for player development.
 The NBA suspended its season March 11, becoming the first of the U.S. major pro leagues to do so after it became known that Utah's All-Star center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. The list of NBA players who were known to test positive eventually grew to 10 — not all were identified — and Commissioner Adam Silver said the actual total was higher.
 The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is a 255-acre campus with multiple arenas that could host games simultaneously and has been home to, among other things, the Jr. NBA World Championship in recent years. ESPN is primarily owned by Disney, one of the NBA’s broadcast partners.

The suburban booster Joel Kotkin wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed, “The experience of the current pandemic is not likely to prove a great advertisement for living cheek by jowl, riding on a crowded subway or getting to work on a busy commuter train.”
 Much of this criticism can be traced to the large number of pandemic cases in New York City, America’s densest. MIT economist Jeffrey Harris went so far as to assert the "subways seeded the massive coronavirus epidemic in New York City."
 Harris' study was convincingly dismantled by Alon Levy, writing in Streetsblog, but the damage to transit ridership and finances nationwide is undeniable. Transit ridership may take years to recover.
 That’s far from the only challenge facing downtowns, however.
 Remote working will hollow out offices, even in successful downtowns such as in Seattle. A Redfin survey last month found that 44% of Seattleites expect to continue working from home indefinitely, the highest percentage among the high-cost cities examined. To be sure, some of these folks live downtown, where the residential population was 88,000 last year.
 The pandemic and ensuing shutdown have raised the potential for a tectonic shakeout in the restaurant industry. The cruise and convention sectors, big parts of downtown Seattle’s lifeblood, are shut for now. An expansion of the Washington State Convention Center is in trouble.
 Some downtown employment may be gone for good. A Downtown Seattle Association survey of businesses in mid-May suggests that about 12,000 of the jobs lost in the core are permanent layoffs. (The central city had about 330,000 jobs as of the start of the year.)

The law makes it more than hard to hold that cop responsible because sooner or later, that cop who has been arrested will be judged by a grand jury and a so- called jury of his peers. All it will take is one racist on that jury to say no, that the cop was only doing his job. If that happens, the message is sent that it’s business as usual.
 We all understand the level of frustration that has led to the riots in Minneapolis. If you are as old as I am, you remember Watts and Rodney King and the fires. Donald Trump has to be chortling about this. He’s already conflating the peaceful protestors with the looters, calling them “thugs.”
 He is taking advantage of the suffering of people of color and using it for political gain. He could not have been given a better, more cynical, political present. Until these protests began, he was losing to Joe Biden but now he will surely run with the news that white society is in danger. The voters in the middle might well be influenced.
 Yes, we get it. We know about American racism. We know that a cop killed a man while other cops stood by. Joe Biden gets it and says so. America has to divest itself once and for all of its racist past and racist president. Now’s the time.

This also gave 19th century astronomers a strong suspicion that Venus does, indeed, have a hefty atmosphere, far denser than the Earth's.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Europe could have its free travel zone up and running again by the end of the month, but travelers from further afield will not be allowed in before July, European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said Friday after talks among the bloc’s interior ministers. Panicked by the coronavirus outbreak in Italy in February, countries in the 26-nation Schengen area — where people and goods move freely without checks — imposed border restrictions without consulting their neighbors to try to keep the disease out. The moves caused traffic jams and blocked medical equipment. Free movement is a jewel in Europe’s crown which helps business flourish, and many European officials feared that the very future of the Schengen area was at threat from the restrictions. These added to pressures already caused by the arrival in Europe of well over 1 million migrants in 2015. “I personally believe that we will return to a full functioning of the Schengen area and freedom of movement of citizens no later than the end of the month of June,” Johansson told reporters after the video-conference meeting. She said Europe’s Centre for Disease Prevention and Control believes that confinement and other health measures are working. The center says that more than 168,000 people have been killed by the coronavirus in Europe, mostly in Britain, Italy, France and Spain. “Physical distancing and other health-related measures are still needed, of course. But health authorities are clear that there is no long a clear justification for either travel restrictions or border measures within the EU Schengen area,” Johansson said. The news should come as a relief to millions of Europeans still trying to work out their summer vacation plans — which begin for many in July once the school year is over — and are...

Bull riding has long been wildly popular with rodeo fans and after three months of being starved of the action due to the COVID-19 virus, you can bet that the Liberty National Bank Xtreme Bulls Classic will be a welcome coming- out party tonight and Saturday for everyone involved.
 Tonight’s first performance at 7:30 p.m. will feature 61 bull riders and the spacious LO Ranch Arena east of Lawton will provide officials plenty of room to allow people to spread out.
 Two former world champions are scheduled to compete tonight – former PRCA world champion Shane Proctor and 2016 PBR champion Cooper Davis.
 The great thing about this weekend’s event is that since there has been a limited number of rodeos, everyone is pretty much still in the running to make the National Finals Rodeo, so they aren’t going to be turning out, or skipping events that have $10,000 added thanks to loyal sponsors like Liberty National Bank.
 “That’s why we have 110 of the best riders in the world, that added money from Liberty National Bank is the difference,” promoter Maury Tate said. “You put that type of added money out there and all the best riders will show up.”
 While Procttor and Davis are the former world champions, tonight’s field also includes Trey Benton III, Jeff Askey, Daylon Swearingen and Dustin Boquet, each of which has reached the National Finals in recent years.
 Proctor appears to have the best draw, getting Late Night from the Frontier Rodeo Company pen. Davis has been matched against ‘Mo Betta’s Night Owl.
 If you can’t make tonight’s first performance, don’t be disappointed because Saturday’s day sheet is loaded as well with former world champions Sage Kimzey and J.W. Harris.
 Kimzey has won the last six PRCA world titles and is the favorite to add to that total in December. Harris won his first title in 2008, then rattled off two more titles in 2009 and 2010. He last won a gold buckle in 2013 and while he’s still picking up some big wins, the young guns are making it hard for him to get back into title contention.
 Kimzey has drawn Trophy Rack from the Frontier herd while Harris will test out Ringo from the Frontier list.
 Another much-anticipated matchup Saturday will pit Sterling’s young Chauk Dees going against Mr. Payday from the ‘Mo Betta herd. Dees made a big statement last season, winning Sidney, Iowa, and then taking the title at the Lawton Rangers Rodeo on the final night of the area’s richest rodeo.
 Like so many young contestants, Dees hasn’t been able to get much action thus far and is trying to make a late move before the busy Fourth of July period.
 Dees is one of the many top young hands who are eager to prove their stock.
 “There are so many good young riders going that it gets tougher and tougher to make the Finals each year,” Tate said. “Guys like Daylon Swearingen. Dustin Bouquet and some other came out of nowhere to make the Finals over the past couple of years.
 “And, Bouquet got a big lift right here at this event two years ago. The good thing is that these guys all need to win some money and this is a great place to do it, especially as some of the bigger rodeos have been cancelled. This should be our best year since we started this event in Lawton.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Sunbathing, sandcastle building and other activities are now allowed on New Hampshire beaches, Gov. Chris Sununu said Friday. The announcement came just four days after beaches had re-opened to walking, swimming and other motion-based activity. Opponents of those restrictions had planned to hold a protest to “draw a line in the sand” on Saturday. Sununu said the decision to remove the restrictions was based on public health data regarding the spread of the coronavirus. Parking remains limited, and groups must stay 6 feet apart from each other. ___ THE NUMBERS As of Thursday, 4,876 people had tested positive for the virus in New Hampshire, an increase of 81 from the previous day. Eight deaths were announced, for a total of 273. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe illness and can lead to death.

OKLAHOMA CITY — A Lawton man is among three charged Wednesday with federal allegations of pulling off unrelated bank robberies.
 Although the suspects got away initially, investigators believe the three men are cornered by evidence.
 Timothy J. Downing, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, announced Thursday that a federal grand jury indicted John Scott Brooks, 36, of Lawton, for federal counts of bank robbery and bomb threat. He is accused of the March 23 robbery of Southwest Oklahoma Federal Credit Union, 6714 W. Gore, and of using a fake bomb.
 According to an affidavit filed in support of a criminal complaint, Brooks is accused of pulling into one of credit union’s drive-through lanes and allegedly handing a demand note to a teller, along with what appeared to the teller to be an explosive device. Brooks then held up a tablet that was counting down time, and the teller then gave fake cash that was easily traceable to Brooks, according to investigators.
 Bank surveillance photos were published in the media and a search warrant was executed at Brooks’ residence in Lawton, located less than a dozen blocks south of the credit union. Brooks was arrested on April 4 and is being held in the Grady County Jail.
 If found guilty of bank robbery, Brooks faces a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, a fine of $250,000, and mandatory restitution. The bomb threat charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
 The case is a result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation — Oklahoma City Field Office and the Lawton Police Department, according to Downing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. Kumeiga is prosecuting the case.
 Brooks was joined by two other accused bank robbers in being charged Wednesday.
 A federal grand jury indicted Keith Lamar Carter, 37, of Oklahoma City for a Dec. 23, 2019, bank robbery of Credit Union One of Oklahoma, 3300 N. Lincoln Blvd., Oklahoma City. Investigators described him as a sort of “BMX bandit.”
 According to the indictment, after handing a note to a teller demanding money, Carter fled on a BMX-style bike. He was later identified, charged on Feb. 13 and arrested on Feb. 25.
 Brandon Scott Newberry, 39, of Ada, also was indicted for bank robbery. He is accused of using a note on May 12 to rob City National Bank and Trust, 9011 NE 23rd, Oklahoma City. He was arrested three days later.

We have seen in the past that controversy and Umar Akmal go hand in hand.

From fitness issues to behavioural incidents and now corruption charges, Akmal has seen it all. Now he is facing a ban of three years as he failed to inform PCB about approaches made to him. Then in an observation made by PCB's disciplinary panel, it was said that Akmal did not show remorse nor did he seek an apology for failing to report corrupt approaches.Akmal was banned for three-years on April 27 by the PCB's Disciplinary Panel, for not reporting spot fix approaches made to him during the Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches."Notices for the hearing have been issued to Umar Akmal and PCB," the cricket board posted on its website.Akmal had filed the appeal against the ban which was imposed after the panel found him guilty of breaching Article 2.4.4 of the PCB Anti-Corruption Code in two separate incidents.The spot fixing offers were made to Akmal at two separate parties held in Defence Housing Society Lahore.The Disciplinary Panel Chairman Mr Justice (retid) Fazal-e-Miran Chauhan had observed that Akmal was non-cooperative and did not show any remorse.The controversial Akmal last played for Pakistan in October, 2019 in a T20 series against Sri Lanka at home.

Early voting in Gordon County for the General Primary and Presidential Primary elections wrapped up on Friday ahead of Tuesday’s election.
 The election had originally been rescheduled for May 19, but the date was pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic, explained Shea Hicks, chairperson of the Gordon County Board of Elections and Voter Registration Office.
 “Considering the circumstances, we are very pleased with the early voting turnout,” said Hicks.
 She also stressed that there will be no early voting on Monday.
 Only four of the 13 local races on the ballot are contested. Additionally, all four of the races feature only Republican candidates, meaning the primary winner will win the seat by default.
 Three Republicans — Christie Owens Fox, Samuel Terrill Jewell and Bryson Reeves — are running for the Gordon County Board of Education Post 6 seat. That position is currently held by Chris Johnson, but he did not seek reelection.
 Meanwhile, Republican Rod Breham is challenging incumbent Bobby E. Hall for the Gordon County Board of Education Post 4 seat.
 The election for the Gordon County Board of Commissioners District 3 seat is another three-way race, with Republicans Robert “Rob” Ballard and Ronald Bruce Potts Jr. both challenging Republican incumbent Norris Sexton.
 Lastly, Republican Ken Padgett is challenging Republican incumbent James Carver for coroner.
 The following incumbents will be on the ballot without opposition:
 ♦ Tax commissioner — Republican Scott Clements
 ♦ Sheriff — Republican Mitch Ralston
 ♦ Clerk of Superior Court — Republican Grant Walraven
 ♦ Judge of Probate Court — Nonpartisan John R. “Richie” Parker
 ♦ Judge of Magistrate Court — Republican James Pat Rasbury
 ♦ County Commission District 1 — Republican M.L. “Bud” Owens

 To the residents of Kingston,
 Our town of Kingston has been most fortunate these past several months where the Covid 19 virus has been prevalent throughout the region. We had not had a confirmed case until March 24 and now there are over 40 confirmed cases. Thankfully our leadership team was ahead of the curve in preparation for the difficult period to come, including following the governor's directive and making arrangements that have kept the town running in the best and safest possible manner.
 Select Board Chairman Josh Warren and Vice Chair Elaine Fiore have kept in constant daily contact with Town Administrator Tom Calter and the various department heads. The flow of information and the regularly scheduled updates have made difficult job demands less stressful and a better environment for both the residents of Kingston and the town employees.
 Josh and Elaine have strong organizational skills and Tom brings numerous contacts at the state level to Kingston in an exercise of teamwork that has helped us maintain local services as best we can in perhaps the most difficult period in the history of local government.
 We know that sometime in the future this crisis will be behind us. We will have learned that communication and solid leadership will be key to keep our community safe.
 We appreciate the understanding and the efforts of our residents and look forward to a \"Healthy Kingston.\" Thank you and continue to be safe.\"

Rand Paul wanted to add an amendment to the bill that would narrow the scope of crimes that fall under its penalties. Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris mounted an emotional opposition, saying the move would weaken the measure. Booker also formally objected to Paul's request, saying the bill "would speak volumes for the racial pain and the hurt of generations." Paul has been holding up the popular bipartisan legislation.

United States Department of Agriculture and Department of Justice are investigating the four powerhouses of the national meatpacking industry — Tyson Foods, JBS, National Beef and Cargill — for fixing or manipulating beef prices. In a related industry, the CEO of Pilgrim’s Pride was one of four current and former chicken company executives indicted Wednesday on charges of price-fixing, according to The Associated Press.
 Twenty senators and 11 state attorneys general have requested federal investigations into market manipulation within the cattle industry as prices continue to rise for customers and drop for farmers.
 “We’re able to get more out of our beef and the consumer is able to pay less for that. It really doesn’t make sense because if we were getting less for our beef going to Cargill and the customer is paying more for it at Walmart, where is that extra money going to?” Blosser said. “We’ve actually come to find out a lot of these commercial processors right now are making about $1,400 per head profit, and it is the biggest gap we’ve seen in our history of the price that the farmer can sell the cow at and the price the processor can sell the carcass beef at.”
 Joe Cloud of T & E Meats said production doubled compared to last April, and the freezer is constantly at max capacity of storage, so he suspended scheduling for all of May and all workers can do is sit and wait for customers to pick up orders.
 Pangle said prices of operations have risen due to purchasing personal protective equipment for workers, but he is committed to keeping prices stagnant for market efficiency.
 “I’m trying to keep meat going out of here as quickly as I can so people can do it this way and keep it cost-effective. I know a lot of people are sitting not working at home right now, so I’m trying to run it through at the same price I was a year ago, and I have no intention of going up,” Pangle said.
 Selling through local processors is oftentimes more affordable for farmers but less efficient since it entails selling the live cattle and then connecting customers to a processor for the meat to be cut up in a roundabout way of ensuring neither the farmer nor processor are selling prepared meat for consumers without USDA inspection.
 Purchasing directly from farmers and local processors is also less attractive to consumers because it’s preferable to buy the whole animal at once, which amounts to a $1,000 upfront bill. Pangle said it is an investment that saves money in the long run and can feed a family for over a year, and the farmers have maintained ethical prices despite the opportunity to take advantage of a mercurial market.
 “Farmers are very interested in selling to local people because they know they’ve been taking a fairly good beating on the beef prices from the big producers. They know that. That’s their life. They’re used to absorbing and they’ve done it,” he said. “They aren’t gouging anybody, and it’d be a perfect time to do it. The opportunity is there to put your price on it. People would probably still buy, but they’re not doing that. They’re meeting the needs of the local community, way I see it. I hope when all this is kind of said and done, the community will continue to support them.”

The relationship between Andy Warhol and personal computers (becoming quite popular during his last years) has been only partially investigated beyond his Amiga works. In November 2015, Sotheby’s sold his “Apple (from Ads)” (acrylic and silkscreen ink on canvas) for 910.000 USD, and in catalogue’s notes Warhol tells about his meeting with Steve Jobs insisting to give him one and showing him how to draw (even if still in black and white): “we went into Sean [John Lennon's son]'s bedroom–and there was a kid there setting up the Apple computer that Sean had gotten as a present, the Macintosh model. I said that once some man had been calling me a lot wanting to give me one, but that I'd never called him back or something, and then the kid looked up and said, 'Yeah, that was me. I'm Steve Jobs.' And he looked so young, like a college guy. And he told me that he would still send me one now. And then he gave me a lesson on drawing with it. It only comes in black and white now, but they'll make it soon in color…I felt so old and out of it with this young whiz guy right there who helped invent it."

But given the global crisis, organisers ruled out a similar celebration."In view of the current economic situation, Tokyo 2020 will not be holding any events to mark the new one year to go milestone for the Games," the organisers said."But we will consider what we can do to show our solidarity with the people."The confirmation came after reports in the Japanese media that organisers would scrap the event, fearing it was inappropriate given the global pandemic and the ongoing risk of infection inside Japan.Kyodo News agency reported that posters and messages of encouragement to athletes might be put up and displayed online instead, adding that the organising committee felt a more "moderate tone" was appropriate.A nationwide state of emergency over the virus has been lifted in Japan, but a recent rise in cases in Tokyo has led to fears of a second wave.Scaled back Games?The latest reports come after Tokyo's governor confirmed the city and organisers are looking at ways to scale back next year's Games.Japanese media said streamlining plans could involve cutting the number of spectators and reducing participation in the opening and closing ceremonies.The Yomiuri Shimbun daily quoted an unnamed source as saying that everyone including athletes, officials and spectators would be required to take a test for the virus.Tokyo 2020 declined to comment on those reports, saying discussions about coronavirus countermeasures would be held "from this autumn onwards".Organisers and Tokyo officials face the twin headaches of ensuring the postponed Games can be held safely, given the pandemic, and keeping additional costs to a minimum.But with the pandemic continuing to rage in much of the world, it remains unclear whether the Games can be held next year.On Friday, a member of the organising committee's executive board said a decision on whether the Games could be held or not would need to be taken in spring."I think we need to decide around March next year," Toshiaki Endo, a former Olympic minister told reporters, denying speculation that the IOC intends to make a decision in October.IOC chief Thomas Bach said last month that 2021 was the "last option" for holding the Tokyo Games, stressing that postponement cannot go on forever.He declined to say whether a vaccine was a prerequisite for going ahead with the Olympics, but was lukewarm on the idea of holding them behind closed doors.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said it would be "difficult" to hold the postponed Tokyo Olympics if the coronavirus pandemic is not contained.And Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori has said the Olympics would have to be cancelled if the disease isn't under control by next year.",

This is a shame because new breeding techniques are powerful tools that, if fully adopted, could help expand the biological diversity of our crops. Wild plant varieties could be used to generate even better cultivars to help farmers surmount challenges unique to their local environments. For example, the wild ancestor of maize (corn) has been studied by geneticists in order to understand how it adapts to different conditions such as high and low elevations and varying climates. This understanding could potentially help develop cold-hardy corn lines for high-latitude regions, as well different varieties better suited for warmer regions.

Gurugram (Haryana) [India], June 5 (ANI/NewsVoir): BML Munjal University (BMU), a Hero Group initiative, today announced the addition of two new undergraduate (UG) degree courses to its academic portfolio - B Com (Hons) and BA (Hons) Economics.   The introduction of these undergraduate courses is in line with BMU's vision to be a world-class inter and cross disciplinary university. It already offers Undergraduate, Post Graduate and Doctoral Programmes in B.Tech, Law, BBA, MBA, PhD along with Executive Education courses.   The university has also announced the new batches for School of Management, School of Economics and Commerce, and School of Engineering and Technology. The application deadline is June 25, 2020. BMU across all its disciplines, will start the new academic year at its state of the art, fully residential campus spread across 50 acres in Gurugram.   The curriculum of the UG courses is predicated on the overall ethos of BMU, of transforming students into well-rounded, industry-ready individuals, who are equipped to take on leadership responsibilities. The university strives to incorporate multi dimensions of creative thinking and design to all its disciplines.   BMU delivers this through its unique experiential-learning environment that nurtures the spirit of inquiry, creativity, problem-solving, entrepreneurship and innovation; and promotes hands-on and cross-disciplinary learning.   "The launch of the UG Honours courses is an important step in our ambition to be a truly interdisciplinary university offering a wide range of academic courses," said Akshay Munjal, President, BML Munjal University.   "We've brought our transformative DNA into the design of these courses. The curriculum blends the present with new age interventions in technology, managerial and communication skills that will allow our students to immediately apply their skills and knowledge in a real-life environment," he added.   "There's a growing need for well-trained and employable UG students in India and the world, who not only possess the theoretical base, but also a practical interdisciplinary approach. BMU has identified certain gap areas and aims to fill that with its intricately designed course structure and experiential approach to learning," said Dr Vishal Talwar, Dean, School of Management, BML Munjal University.   The Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) degree is designed to provide students with a wide range of managerial, analytical, communication and problem-solving skills while at the same time building competence in a particular area of business.   The course is unique and blends cutting edge courses such as fundamentals of Blockchain and Robotic Process Automation which are embedded in the three-year program. With Blockchain and AI rapidly transforming the Banking, Finance and Insurance sectors, the course is designed to train students to function effectively in an ecosystem that thrives in such technologies.   The B Com (Hons) will offer super specializations in Blockchain and Financial Technologies, Forensic Accounting and Fraud, Banking and Insurance, and Derivatives and Risk Management.   The Bachelor of Economics (Hons) aims to provide the students with an analytical approach to looking at global economic issues and attain a deeper understanding of possible explanations and their extensive influences on society.   BMU's subscription to various latest economic and financial databases will be a key ingredient of the program. The practical program structure will give a scope to the student to complete his/her degree in a more interdisciplinary manner by choosing management or finance as minor. This will also enable better employability after graduating.   Admissions to the BML Munjal University are purely on the basis of merit and aptitude, with the university being fair and considerate on the aspiration of the student to make a life worth its while.

A man was arrested and two others were detained for questioning on Friday by the joint investigation team of the police and forest departments in connection with the brutal killing of a pregnant elephant in Kerala's Palakkad, the state's forest minister K Raju said.The arrested man was identified as P Wilson, an employee of an estate that cultivates cash crops and spices on the fringe areas of the Silent Valley National Park.Wilson reportedly told the probe team that he used to make explosive-laden snares to check crop-raiding wild boars. He said he made the latest snare after he was asked by two others, who have been identified."More arrests will take place soon," the forest minister said. Union environment minister Prakash Javedkar had announced another probe by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, which has also begun its investigation.Autopsy report The death of the 15-year-old elephant came to light on May 27 when a forest officer, Mohan Krishnan, wrote a Facebook post after witnessing its painful death in a river. Initial reports suggested that the elephant died after eating a pineapple stuffed with crackers but the latest post-mortem report said it was a coconut and that her wounds were two-week-old. By the time the elephant died, all that remained of her body was a skeleton.The 15-year-old elephant reportedly rushed to the nearby Velliyar River in the Silent Valley rain forests after eating the cracker-filled fruit and stood there for many days with its trunk and head immersed in the water perhaps to nurse its wounds. Forest officials rushed to save the jumbo after local people alerted them but it succumbed to its injuries on May 27 and during the autopsy, it was found to be pregnant. Locals later said the jumbo was around the river for more than a week.War of wordsThe incident took a political colour later after many BJP leaders, including Maneka Gandhi, said Malappuram is the most violent district in the country.Though the incident took place in Palakkad many inadvertently named the Muslim-majority Malappuram and some even dragged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleging that it took place in Wayanad, his Lok Sabha constituency in north Kerala."It is sad some people are venting their anger without verifying where exactly it took place. It exposes their communal intention," PK Kunhalikuty, the Muslim League MP who represents Malappuram, said.Kunhalikuty said it was a big insult to the people of his constituency. CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also condemned "the move to communalise an unfortunate incident." Upset with a particular district being targeted, many film artists including Tovino Thomas, Ashiq Abu and others began an online campaign "#I stand with Malappuram" which was supported by many.Many posters came up in Malappuram condemning sweeping comments without verifying facts.Previous deathsAfter the incident triggered countrywide protests, many wildlife activists said this was not the first death of its sort.Another female elephant was killed in Kollam in south Kerala in April after it ate cracker-filled watermelon and two years ago another jumbo was killed in Idukki after swallowing jaggery-coated explosives, they said. They said in such cases it is difficult to pinpoint offenders as the animals travel 100-200km a day in search of food and water and added that most of the cases remain unnatural death only on paper.The shocking incident has revived the debate on the growing man-animal conflict in the state which has a 29.1% forest cover. In 2018-19, 24 people were killed by wild elephants and 12 died in tiger attacks and 9400 man-animal conflict incidents were reported, according to the latest forest statistics. Kerala, which is home to many wildlife parks and reserves, has 5,706 elephants, according to the 2019 census. The state has 720 domesticated jumbos and a majority of them are owned by temples.The Guruvayur Sree Krishna temple has the highest number of captive jumbos at 59.Elephants are adored in Kerala and many captive animals carry names. Caparisoned elephants are an integral part of all festivals and big gatherings in the state.Hundred-odd elephants take part in the annual festival of 'Thrissur Pooram', Kerala's biggest cultural festival, along with an ensemble of percussion instrument players.

To the residents of Kingston,
 Our town of Kingston has been most fortunate these past several months where the Covid 19 virus has been prevalent throughout the region. We had not had a confirmed case until March 24 and now there are over 40 confirmed cases. Thankfully our leadership team was ahead of the curve in preparation for the difficult period to come, including following the governor's directive and making arrangements that have kept the town running in the best and safest possible manner.
 Select Board Chairman Josh Warren and Vice Chair Elaine Fiore have kept in constant daily contact with Town Administrator Tom Calter and the various department heads. The flow of information and the regularly scheduled updates have made difficult job demands less stressful and a better environment for both the residents of Kingston and the town employees.
 Josh and Elaine have strong organizational skills and Tom brings numerous contacts at the state level to Kingston in an exercise of teamwork that has helped us maintain local services as best we can in perhaps the most difficult period in the history of local government.
 We know that sometime in the future this crisis will be behind us. We will have learned that communication and solid leadership will be key to keep our community safe.
 We appreciate the understanding and the efforts of our residents and look forward to a "Healthy Kingston." Thank you and continue to be safe."

The news that the full test-and-trace programme might not be up and running until September has led some to think this applies to the NHS contact-tracing app, rather than the wider manual tracing effort.
 The confusion is understandable - after all it's not long ago that ministers talked as if the app was the centrepiece of the programme rather than the "cherry on top" as Baroness Harding described it this week.
 My understanding is that the app, which has indeed suffered a number of delays, should still be rolled out nationwide by late June or early July - although there is no guarantee that the timetable won't slip further.

 Suzanne W. Knecht, 79, of Warren Center, formerly of Denmark, Maine and Towanda, Pennsylvania, passed away peacefully at her home on Tuesday evening, June 2, 2020.
 Suzanne was born on July 3, 1940 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a daughter of the late Frederick and Margaret Gertrude (Cloud) Willing. A loving wife, a devoted mother and a caring grandmother, her greatest pleasure was to give whatever she had to others. Suzanne lived her life with grace, dignity, humor and courage. She was a faithful member of the West Warren Congregational Church where she played the piano and organ for services. Suzanne enjoyed tending to her flower gardens, sewing and knitting — although her greatest pleasure was being surrounded by her family.

Still, nabbing Venus this close to the sun presents a tough challenge. Such a passage is difficult to observe for obvious reasons: The nearby sun can fry camera sensors, scorch optical coatings, and cause lens elements to come unglued… and of course, visually observing is dangerous and out of the question. Skilled observers who took the "Venus challenge' used pinpoint tracking and took steps to hood and shield optics. No telescopes were harmed during the imaging of Venus this week. Sharin Ahmad successfully imaged Venus from his rooftop observatory in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and broke his previous personal record on Tuesday June 2, catching Venus just 2 degrees and 48' from the sun.

Gold is hanging in there around $1,700 but isn't exactly benefiting from this period of dollar weakness. The rally this week in equity markets and continual improvement in risk appetite may be holding it back as it maybe re-establishes the relationship that was lost during the early months of the pandemic. The yellow metal looks pretty comfortable around $1,700 so further consolidation may be on the cards, although the path of least resistance - if there is one - seems to be below.

Bentley sales grew by 5% to end 2019 at 11,006 units, resulting in a profit of 65 million euros (approximately $74 million). This was thanks in part to a turnaround plan implemented after a shocker of a 2018 where the automaker lost 288 million euros, due primarily to the delayed launch of the redesigned Continental GT. But the latest slowdown caused by the coronavirus is proving to be a major blow, with sales in 2020 likely to come in much lower than 2019's result.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — An appeals court in Burundi on Friday upheld the two-and-a-half-year prison sentence for four journalists convicted on charges of trying to undermine state security. The journalists are with Iwacu, one of the few remaining private media organizations in the East African nation. “Our four colleagues remain in prison at Bubanza. We will keep claiming justice and take the affair to the Supreme Court. We thank all those who support us,” Iwacu leader Antoine Kaburahe said in a Twitter post. The four were arrested in October in Musigati district in the western province while covering the aftermath of clashes between the army and a rebel group from South Kivu in neighboring Congo. President Pierre Nkurunziza’s government cracked down on the media ahead of the May presidential election won by the ruling party candidate. Several local radio stations and media houses closed and many journalists fled the country. “These (Iwacu) journalists should never have been arrested for doing their work. This case has been nothing but retaliation for journalism,\" said Muthoki Mumo, the Committee to Protect Journalists representative in sub-Saharan Africa. “This case is empty,” added Arnaud Froger, Africa manager for Reporters Without Borders. Burundi has been plagued by political violence since 2015, when Nkurunziza announced he would seek a disputed third term. He won re-election despite widespread protests, and the United Nations says more than 1,200 people were killed in the ensuing crackdown. Nkurunziza surprised many by not running again this time, but some in Burundi worry he will assert power behind the scenes as the ruling party's “Supreme Guide.”

"First, we observed this animal on May 23 when we were informed by locals that an elephant was seen roaming around in the private area of the forest. When one of our staff members went to see the elephant, it was observed that she had suffered an injury in the the lower jaw area. Later, for at least 24 hours the animal was trying to look for water and on May 24 we received information that the animal has come into river Velliyar," Krishnan said on Facebook.

"Thank you for choosing me to be the CHL Scholastic Player of the Year award winner," Perfetti said in a release. "It's a big honour for me and something that I worked for all season. To be able to be a part of this trophy, and a group of all the prior recipients, it means a lot to me. There are a lot of great players to have won in the past and even better people. I want to say thank you to my family and my billets. Without them I wouldn't be where I am today. They give me the support and the love that I need to excel both on and off the ice and in the classroom and without them I wouldn't be in the spot that I am now. I also want to say thank you to the Spirit organization and to Pam Moretuzzo especially. Everyone in the organization is trying to make each player a better student, a better hockey player, but most importantly a better person. Pam is our high school advisor and day in, day out, she's always taking care of me and making sure that each player is set up for greatness. I can't thank her enough and I can't thank the Spirit organization enough for providing me with all the resources and help I need to thrive both on and off the ice."
