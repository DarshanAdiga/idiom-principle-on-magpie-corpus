I think I got my first Chinese takeaway in Messines Terrace in Derry well over 30 years ago.   It may well have been called Raymond’s then (there are now two) but last week I was struck by a very sad message on the takeaway menu, which read “Please enjoy our food with your 100% relaxation on China Kitchen. We don’t have coronavirus! Our employees are healthy and our food is safe, don’t worry anything. Thank you very much. A happy mood for you every day.”   Many Oriental restaurants are suffering because of the virus scare, but it doesn’t seem to be affecting Italian restaurants at all, which is rather ironic, considering where most of the European spread has stemmed from.   Not that it should affect any restaurants, other than the fear of being in a space with others, but recently, I detect a latent trepidation in the air as St Patrick’s Day looms in particular.   Funny old world . . . our mammies were blue in the face telling us to constantly wash our hands. You’d think it was a recent discovery!

Since 2005, he has also volunteered his time and expertise as a trustee to the MASA Foundation, an organization that supports the development of professional practice in school leadership.
 Amoroso’s background includes a wide range of experiences at both the school district and state level. He has been a teacher, assistant principal, principal, director of educational services and human resources, and for 15 years, a school superintendent.
 He has been active in the statewide and national dialogue on educational policy issues, working with a variety of groups to promote and support public education.
 Amoroso has spoken before numerous education and civic groups in addition to serving as an adjunct professor in educational leadership for Saint Mary’s University.
 “During his tenure as executive director, I have been able to observe first hand Gary’s leadership style. He is always prepared, pleasant and thoughtful in the way he worked with MASA members and the MASA Foundation Board. He showed concern for young or new individuals moving into the superintendency or other leadership positions,” said Dale Jensen, retired superintendent and former MASA executive director. “One of the other things that has changed dramatically since I was at MASA is the tremendous use of technology to effectively communicate with MASA members and others. Gary Amoroso has been an effective and thoughtful leader for MASA and I wish him well in the next chapter of his life.”
 Amoroso received his Ph.D. in educational administration from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He holds a specialist’s certificate in educational administration and a master’s degree in education administration and supervision from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Amoroso earned a bachelor’s degree in broad field social studies and history is from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.

The coronavirus outbreak might cost the global economy $1-2 trillion in 2020, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development. Its potential impact on the Indian economy is not yet known, but several sectors are already feeling the pain, Here's a look at the sectors most impacted by the outbreak. Aviation 585 international flights cancelled by private carriers as on March 6 As part of its efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19, India on March 12 suspended almost all visas for a month, adding to the woes of airlines. As of March 6, Indian private carriers had cancelled 93 international flights and global airlines 492 flights, according to data shared by the government in the Lok Sabha. With the number of Covid-19 cases in India increasing two and a half times over the past week to 84, travellers might be hesitant to even fly within the country. “There will be a further demand slump in the domestic segment, at least for the next few weeks,” says Kapil Kaul, chief executive for aviation consultancy CAPA India. Indigo, India’s largest airline, has reported a 15-20% decline in daily bookings over the past few days, compared with the week-ago period, and expects its quarterly earnings to be “materially impacted”. Kaul says the impact of coronavirus on airlines will be deeper than epidemics in the past. This crisis comes at a time when airlines are also being hit by a falling rupee. Clearly, airlines have to navigate a lot of turbulence. ------- Hospitality 35% fall reported in restaurant business With several companies restricting all but essential travel, business hotels in major cities could be left with a lot of empty rooms. Kapil Chopra, founder and CEO of Postcard Hotels & Resorts, says average occupancy in these hotels could fall from 70-75% to 20%, if they haven’t already, even as demand in holiday destinations continues to be strong. As people become more cautious, restaurants have reported a decline of 30-35% in business in the past few days. And restaurants at malls have recorded a sharper drop, says Anurag Katriar, president of the National Restaurant Association of India. “Delivery segment is seeing the least impact.” Multiplexes will also have to contend with a fall in demand. Delhi, Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir have ordered that cinemas be shut till March 31. Maharashtra has also ordered the closure of cinemas in some cities, hurting multiplex chains like PVR Cinemas and Inox Leisure Limited. Movie producers globally and in India have deferred the release of movies such as the latest James Bond franchise, No Time to Die, and Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi. -------- Apparel 35% of apparel export orders come from Europe Raja Shanmugam, an apparel manufacturer in Tirupur, India’s largest textile hub, is a worried man. “There is a fear psychosis because of coronavirus. If this continues for 2-3 weeks, it could be really bad for us.” India exported over Rs 1 lakh crore of garments in 2018-19, according to the ministry of commerce. Exports bring in 60% of Indian apparel makers’s revenues. Europe alone accounts for a third of India’s garment exports. But with the region being declared the new epicentre for the disease by the World Health Organization, new orders are bound to be affected. “But it is hard to assess the outcome now. We’ll know in the next couple of weeks,” says Shanmugam, who also heads the Tirupur Exporters’ Association. What is accentuating the apparel industry’s problems is the decline in footfalls at stores, both as a result of people’s reluctance to visit them and the closure of malls. ------- Consumer Durables and Electronics 15% decline seen in mobile shipments in Jan-March India’s consumer durables industry is heaving a sigh of relief as factories in China resume operations after Covid-19 cases taper off in the country. But as India grapples with a rising incidence of the disease, visits to stores might dwindle due to a fear of being exposed to the virus in public spaces, says Kamal Nandi, president of the Consumer Electronics and Appliance Manufacturers Association. This would hurt demand. India imports around 45% of its consumer durables from China, according to CRISIL. India also relies heavily on China for components like compressors for air conditioners and open cell TV panels. Similarly, mobile handset shipments to India are also likely to be hit by the supply disruption in China. According to Counterpoint Research, there could be a 15% fall in mobile shipments in the January-March quarter, from the corresponding period of 2019, and there could be a similar impact in the next three months. -------- Poultry and Seafood 30% fall reported in demand for chicken in the past three weeks With the spread of the coronavirus, it was not surprising to see a spurt in unsubstantiated social media messages on the dos and don’ts. Among these was a warning to stay away from meat, which has driven down demand for chicken, the meat of choice for Indians, by around 30% in the past three weeks, says industry sources. To prevent stock pileup, poultry companies have been forced to sell birds at Rs 25 per kg, a third of the raising cost, says B Soundararajan, chairman of poultry company Suguna Foods. Despite the food safety regulator assuring people that the virus does not spread through poultry, it might take weeks for the Rs 80,000 crore chicken industry to bounce back. As far as seafood is concerned, India’s worries are more on the export front. Seafood exports brought in Rs 46,600 crore in 2018-19, with the US, European Union and China being the top markets, according to the Marine Products Export Development Authority. Though the number of Covid-19 cases in China has been on the decline, it is not clear if the US and Europe have seen the worst yet. Exporters say demand could be hit.

CEDAR RAPIDS -- Cole Erickson was supposed to be wrestling for a national championship this weekend, completing his senior season on the mat for Coe College at the NCAA Division III Wrestling Championships at the U.S. Cellular Center.
   
 Instead, the Mediapolis High School graduate was sitting in his apartment, trying to wrap his head around all that had transpired in the past 24 hours after the NCAA canceled all of its winter and spring championships because of the coronavirus outbreak.
   
 And it left Erickson to ponder what the future holds, both short term and long term after his wrestling career came to an abrupt halt.
   
 "(Thursday) was interesting, to say the least. I am still shell-shocked as to how everything played out," Erickson said. "You feel like the carpet has been pulled out from underneath you, but there's nothing you can do about it."
   
 Erickson, along with every other qualifier for the tournament, was at the arena on Thursday afternoon awaiting weigh-ins. Two hours later, the tournament was canceled, leaving hundreds of wrestlers, coaches and fans wondering what to do next.
   
 "The whole thing is really weird," Erickson said. "The weirdest part is the DIII's is that everyone was already here. Everyone was in the arena before they made the decision. We had to be here by two o'clock for weigh-ins and then around four o'clock they canceled it."
   
 Erickson did go out on a winning note, beating Rafael Roman of North Central, 12-0, in the 157-pound third-place match at the Lower Midwest Regional in Dubuque on March 1.
   
 But it wasn't the way Erickson wanted to end his wrestling career.
   
 "I feel like I still have some unfinished business," Erickson said. "It's heartbreaking to not go out on your own terms. I feel like I did everything I needed to do to be prepared for this weekend. Then 17 hours before it starts, the carpet is pulled out from under you because of things that are out of your hands. But nothing you do or say is going to change the outcome. I'm just kind of shell-shocked right now."
   
 Erickson is on schedule to graduate this spring, but with spring break being extended an extra week and classes no in jeopardy, even that is up in the air.
   
 "I am trying to figure out where to go next. Maybe I will pursue a nursing degree," Erickson said. "I have a lot of grown-up decisions to figure out, like where I am going next in my life in general and just build off of that. It's time to move on to the next chapter of my life.
   
 "It's a weird time to be living in right now with all the craziness going on and the way the coronavirus is affecting society as a whole."

L’iniziativa “dei balconi musicali” è stata commovente e partecipata. Ha coinvolto musicisti e anche tanti amatori, ma soprattutto ha sorpreso e dato un incoraggiamento a tanti cittadini costretti a stare in casa. Per questo la Scuola di Musica di Fiesole, il Conservatorio Cherubini, l’Ort Orchestra della Toscana e il Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, con la collaborazione di Fondazione CR Firenze e Comune di Firenze, hanno pensato di suonare e cantare dalle loro abitazioni alle 18 di ogni domenica e di ogni giovedì. Suoneranno per sé stessi e per gli altri, per i vicini e i concittadini, coinvolgendo - questo è l’auspicio - le altre importanti realtà musicali presenti sul territorio, della Città metropolitana e della Regione, magari varcandone il confine. A questa iniziativa sono ovviamente chiamati anche tutti gli amatori che si uniranno in una enorme comune orchestra fiorentina facendo risuonare Firenze “La Città Incantata" in un legame non solo virtuale. L’idea è nata ripensando a quell’entusiasmante concerto intitolato “La piazza incantata” che vide suonare assieme per la prima volta, nell’estate del 2017, chiamate dalla Fondazione CR Firenze per celebrare i 25 anni di attività le quattro istituzioni. Fu un momento di grande emozione che inaugurò un inedito sodalizio grazie alla capacità di Fondazione CR Firenze di essere costruttore di reti tra le più dinamiche realtà del territorio. Per questo motivo Fiesole, Ort, Conservatorio e Maggio, comunque sempre legate tra loro in molteplici collaborazioni, hanno pensato di saldarsi nuovamente assieme, anche se in maniera virtuale, per unire, con la musica, Firenze, la ”Città Incantata”. Firenze in questi giorni sembra infatti incantata ma soprattutto a causa dal silenzio quasi irreale che l’avvolge. Il silenzio che tuttavia può essere anche una condizione positiva per cose che in molti avevano “scordato” magari come apprezzare il silenzio stesso, gli affetti familiari, il tempo che passa più lento, ma soprattutto la solidarietà con i vicini e i concittadini. La Scuola di Musica di Fiesole, il Conservatorio Cherubini, l’ORT - Orchestra della Toscana e il Maggio Musicale Fiorentino hanno così pensato che quanto è successo ieri - la musica dai balconi - può essere riproposto e rivolgono un appello ad unirsi a loro a musicisti, allievi, professori, professori d'orchestra, coristi per far risuonare nell’aria ‘’la grande voce di Firenze’’. Domenica 15 marzo alle 18, saranno le note dell’Inno di Mameli che sempre unisce gli italiani a suggellare una grande impresa solidale e di speranza.
