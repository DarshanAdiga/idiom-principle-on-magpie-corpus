"Over the years you create certain nonverbal communications or you get used to working with a certain person and you guys might play a certain play one way," Wagner said. "Then somebody comes in and you have to either explain how you guys are playing that play or adjustments. Sometimes that happens in the game and you're trying to adjust on the fly. The whole thing as far as the pass game, we just have to do better."

As well as Milan, Neil Lennon's side will take on Czech Cup winners Sparta Prague and French club Lille, who qualified automatically for the group stage after finishing fourth in Ligue 1.
 Milan, the seven-time European champions, qualified by winning 9-8 on penalties away to Rio Ave in Portugal on Thursday after being rescued by a Hakan Calhanoglu spot-kick right at the end of extra time.
 The Scottish champions and Milan last met in the Champions League group stage in 2013/14. They also faced off several times in that competition in the previous decade including in 2006/07, when the Italians narrowly won their last-16 tie en route to winning the trophy.
 Rangers' reward for ousting Turkish giants Galatasaray in the play-offs and qualifying for the group stage for the third season running was a spot in Group D with Benfica, Standard Liege of Belgium and Lech Poznan of Poland.
 Steven Gerrard's side may fancy their chances of reaching the knockout phase again, after losing to Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16 last season.

 Arsenal will play three teams who dropped out of the Champions League qualifiers in Rapid Vienna, Norwegian champions Molde, and Dundalk of Ireland.
 It is Dundalk's second appearance in the group stage in five seasons and the Arsenal clash in particular will be a glamour tie for them.
 They will hope their fans can attend the match, with UEFA announcing on Thursday that they will allow spectators back at a maximum of 30 percent of capacity.
 However, the loosening of restrictions is subject to national authorities giving the green light.
 Leicester City will play Braga, AEK Athens and Zorya Luhansk of Ukraine in Group G, while Jose Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur were placed in Group J alongside Bulgarian champions Ludogorets, LASK of Austria and Belgian Cup winners Antwerp.

 Trades in which tens of millions of dollars were spent betting on the biggest American technology companies have again surfaced in the options market, weeks after the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group was linked to similar wagers. Amazon.com, Facebook and Netflix were among companies that saw block trades of call contracts Thursday, representing speculation on movements in their shares through the first months of next year. Call options are bullish bets by themselves but can also be paired with other positions as part of a hedge. The identity of the buyer wasn't known. Analysts noted a resemblance to a series of wagers made by SoftBank over the summer, which entailed billions of dollars of call purchases in tech stocks. Those "Nasdaq whale" wagers --combined with an explosion in buying by individuals and day traders in short-dated options -- were theorised by some analysts to have created a bullish feedback loop that contributed to the August rally in the Nasdaq 100. "The structure of the trades combined with the timing certainly has a lot of investors spe­culating the Nasdaq whale is back in the marketplace today," said Chris Murphy, derivatives strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP. A SoftBank spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of all four companies rose Thursday amid a broad rally in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Murphy said he saw evidence Thursday's positions were part of a larger "delta-neutral" position in which underlying stock was sold in tandem with the call trading. The goal of such a strategy can vary, but is often a hedge against declines in the stock, he said. The latest trades come amid another blistering stretch for technology stocks. The Nasd­aq 100 climbed 1.5 per cent Thursday, and has risen in seven of the last nine sessions, rallying almost 6 per cent over the span after falling into a correction earlier in September. The gauge is up 33 per cent in 2020, an annual return that would rank among the five best of the last two decades.
