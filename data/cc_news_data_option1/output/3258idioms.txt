"This year, we have deployed two boats. One for transporting COVD-19 patients, while the other was used for general patients. These boats were in service round the clock. Basically, these boats were pressed into service as rescue boats during monsoon flooding to rescue people. Currently, one boat is in service all the time. This is because many people live in interior areas and they need boats to reach the hospital. The regular boat service stops working at 10 pm and after that, they had no other options," a report in The News Minute quoted Shaji V Nair, director of Kerala Water Transport Department.

Virginia lawmakers plan to take up dozens of criminal justice reforms during a special legislative session this week, but one proposal in particular is expected to spark an intense battle: a push to change a law that allows police to charge people with felony assault even if the arresting officers are not seriously hurt. Dantio was arrested in 2013 when she went to a church in the middle of the night to try to see a priest. Dantio, who has mental health issues and was homeless at the time, said she did not immediately respond to Fairfax County police officers who responded to a trespassing call.Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

After a bit of a false start with off-the-shelf software that proved slow and clunky, Prose built its own version. Based on customers’ answers to a detailed 25-question online survey, which asks about hair type, scalp health and even Zip code, the software quickly determines the mixture each individual should get. Prose says it can deliver up to 79 trillion possible formulations using more than 160 ingredients, which range from the prosaic (coconut oil) to the exotic (butterfly pea flower). As with any business that relies on data and machine learning, the more customers who complete Prose’s questionnaire (so far, more than 2 million have), the more information it has to refine its products. Helping retain those customers is Prose’s new subscription business, in which members get 15% off and one-on-one styling tips.

 With 1:54 left in the game and the Jazz up by four, Mitchell was unaware the shot clock had started at 22 seconds instead of the normal 24 because Rudy Gobert had blocked Nikola Jokic's shot out of bounds, which brought the play clock down.
 Mitchell started walking the ball slowly up court and did not realise he had failed to pass midcourt in time, leading to him being pinged for the infringement.
 "That's my fault as a leader and as a point guard at that time," Mitchell said. "That's terrible on my part.

Regarding that claim about saving 40,000 lives, Biden presumably is referring to this statistical analysis that models the effects of various mitigation policies. It estimates that between 17 to 55,000 lives would have been saved if employees nationwide were required to wear masks between April and May.


  The problem with Biden’s claim then should be obvious. Requiring employees to be masked is not the same as requiring all Americans to be masked, and the situation in April and May is significantly different from the situation now. For one thing, masks are much more accepted now than they were before. And secondly, the infection has already spread through all or nearly all major cities in America — which means population immunity, although not yet at herd immunity levels, is going to be much greater than it was in April.


  Thus, universal masking now will not have the same impact as it may have had earlier. Now, masking is still helpful — and again, a prudent step to take when needed. But it is impossible to say that without a national mask mandate, and its requisite enforcement, 40,000 Americans would be lost. Stating so amounts to reprehensible fear-mongering.


  That’s one reason politicians shouldn’t be trying to politicize mask wearing with mandates — and calling for heavy-handed solutions they know are impossible, backed by outlandish claims they know are misleading. It compromises public trust and diverts us from doing the right thing.


  Americans, by and large, are generous, caring people. We need to trust them to care for themselves and their loved ones by wearing masks when social distancing is not possible. As President Donald Trump has said, it’s the patriotic thing to do.

En consecuencia, nunca podrás ganar más, porque todos somos iguales y debemos ganar lo mismo. Menos ellos.... ¿Qué harás cuando veas que Petro y todos sus corruptos asesores siguen viviendo en las mansiones que poseen hoy, como emperadores millonarios, y tú vivirás, entre tanto, apretujado en una casucha de lata y cartón? ¿Qué harás tras saber que las familias de esos líderes miopes viven en el exterior disfrutando del dinero de un país que algún día fue hermoso y próspero? ¿Qué harás cuando aceptes que te lo advirtieron y no creíste como no creyeron los cubanos, los nicaragüenses ni los venezolanos y hoy están lamentándose? ¿Qué querrás hacer en los próximos días, mas no puedes realizarlo, porque por solo intentarlo te asesinan tanto a ti como a tu familia? ¡Reacciona ahora mismo! Levántate de esa silla, de esa cama, de ese letargo y habla con tus amigos, conocidos y familiares, para tratar de frenar ya el lavado de cerebro que nos está haciendo la izquierda, con el fin de llevarnos al degolladero. Participa en las charlas sobre el tema, defiende tu opinión con fundamentos y con la experiencia vivida. Habla con tus hijos y explícales la verdad destructora del socialismo, prepárate para estar dispuesto a actuar. ¡No más silencio! Si tenemos que salir a las calles, saldremos. Pero no nos dejaremos esclavizar. No más bloqueos de vías públicas, no más bloqueos de universidades, no más vandalismo ni terrorismo. Nos haremos sentir. ¡Los sensatos somos más numerosos! Exigiremos que esa minoría violenta respete a Colombia. Somos 50 millones de colombianos, los vándalos terroristas son 500 compatriotas y 15 mil son los venezolanos enviados por Maduro. Podemos y debemos derrotar a los violentos títeres mamertos del farsante Gustavo Francisco Petro Urrego. A nuestra invaluable Fuerza Pública no la dejan actuar como deberían, mas no nos pueden prohibir a los colombianos defender lo que nos pertenece.

Como resultado de esto los hemos dejado avanzar para que nos monten el conflicto armado y lo financien con su narcotráfico. Si no actuamos ya, tan solo nos quedará lamentarnos, llorar y, quizá, desear huir, sin tener para dónde. ...

To give a background, direct monetization of deficit refers to a scenario where a central bank prints currency to the tune of accommodating massive deficit spending by the government. RBI does so by purchasing government securities directly in the primary market. Such a monetization process used to be automatic only until 1997, when it was later decided to end this practice by entrusting RBI to conduct such OMOs (Open Market Operations) only in the secondary market. However, an escape clause in the 2017 amendment of the FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act) act permits such direct monetisation under special circumstances.

 And while it looks as though the new iPhones are on schedule for the fall, when exactly they will launch during the season is still up in the air. We usually see new flagship iPhones in September, but Apple confirmed there will be a delay on the iPhone 11 sequels due to the coronavirus. That's because early into the outbreak, COVID-19 forced suppliers in China to shut down or operate on limited capacity. This affected not only inventory in September but it may affect sales, too. Apple also closed its US retail stores, though now some have reopened in limited ways.

FRAMINGHAM -- The city's Board of License Commissioners voted unanimously to slap a $2,500 fine on Samba Steak & Sushi after a fifth violation of its liquor license.
 Monday night's decision came with a warning from board member Stuart Pologe -- one more violation and the business, which has operated for 13 years in Framingham, could be shut down.
 "Please don't put us in this position again," Pologe said to Samba owner Shiyun "Joe" Zhang, who attended the virtual hearing with his lawyer, Christopher Mingace. "You will be closed. Your employees will be out of work."
 Besides the fine, Samba was hit with a 30-day suspension of its liquor license, held in abeyance for two years.
 Samba will immediately serve a 14-day suspension, after the board approves a written version of Monday's decision, expected to occur at its next meeting.
 The two-week suspension represents the number of days remaining from a 30-day suspension Samba was given by the board last summer for committing three liquor-license violations in 2018. Samba served 16 days of that suspension.
 Zhang told the board he assumed he was operating with a valid liquor license when a police compliance check on June 12 showed he illegally served food and drink, including alcohol, at outdoor tables in the restaurant's parking lot. At the time, the board had not approved Samba for outdoor dining during the coronvirus pandemic.
 Board approval came June 15, and the city notified Zhang the next day.
 "Confusing" was the word Zhang used to describe the application process during the pandemic. He said everything was shut down, including City Hall. As a result, city officials gave no updates on his application.
 "I kept open. I wanted to be part of the community," Zhang said.
 City Solicitor Christopher Petrini and members of the board said they doubted Zhang's confusion, and pointed out that he was fined three times -- for a total of $600 -- in May and early June. Two of the fines were for serving food and drinks on site during the pandemic, a violation of Gov. Charlie Baker's executive order. The third was for allowing outdoor seating in the parking lot during the pandemic without receiving local approval.
 "I don't see the confusion here. He was fined three times, and continued to operate," Petrini said.
 Several members of the public urged the board to be lenient, given how hard it is for restaurants to survive financially during the pandemic.
 "Joe's doing the best he can," said Traci Simpson, Zhang's wife. "He didn't deserve a violation. He's just doing the best he can."
 One member of the public who supported a punitive step is Southborough Police Chief Kenneth Paulhus. He told the board two Southborough police cruisers were hit by drunk drivers leaving Zhang's other restaurant, China Gourmet in Framingham.
 Police attempts to obtain surveillance video at China Gourmet that potentially captured those customers being served alcohol were unsuccessful. Police were told the video was destroyed in an electrical fire. Paulhus believes it was purposely destroyed.
 Zhang faces a charge in Middlesex Superior Court of withholding evidence from an official proceeding. A court clerk said a final trial conference is set for Sept. 25, with a jury trial possible in October.
 The first trial ended in a hung jury, which led to a mistrial.
 License Board member Tiel Wadland remarked on Paulhus' testimony, saying "I'm in shock," because Zhang told the board at an earlier meeting that all issues with Southborough police were resolved.
 Wadland also didn't buy Zhang's claim that he was confused with the application process for securing outdoor seating during the pandemic.
 "I think he knew what was going on," Wadland said.
 Ultimately, the board decided to give Zhang one more chance, because of the sensitivity the community has for businesses struggling to survive during the pandemic, and not wanting to see Samba's employees out of work.
 But a sixth violation could result in closure for Samba, and board member Sara Porter gave Zhang a piece of advice.
 "When in doubt, don't play fast and loose" with the rules, she said.

All told, he admitted to harming 87 victims in 53 separate crimes scenes spanning 11 California counties in a plea deal that spares him the death penalty.


  Sixteen of his rape victims plan to confront him Tuesday.


  A similar number will tell a Sacramento County judge on Wednesday and Thursday how DeAngelo’s crimes changed their lives, before he is formally sentenced Friday.


  Victims to tell Golden State Killer about trauma, healing


  Jane Carson-Sandler says she has served the equivalent of a life sentence in the more than four decades since she became one of the first rape victims of DeAngelo.


  Now it's DeAngelo's turn to do his time.


  Carson-Sandler will be among nearly three dozen survivors and family members of victims who plan to confront DeAngelo during an extraordinary four days of court hearings before the 74-year-old is sentenced to life in prison.


  Beginning Tuesday, some plan to tell of their pain, others of their healing.


  It's the culmination of a plea deal that will spare DeAngelo the death penalty for 13 murders and numerous sadistic rapes and burglaries that terrorized California for more than a decade. His reign of terror mystified investigators until they used a new form of DNA tracking to arrest him in 2018.


  "Our wounds heal and our scars remain," Carson-Sandler said.


  Certain things always trigger flashbacks of the night in 1976 when DeAngelo confronted Carson-Sandler with a butcher knife as she snuggled in bed with her 3-year-old son after her husband left for work at a nearby military base.


  She can't go skiing, for fear she'll see someone in a ski mask like the one DeAngelo wore. The sound of a helicopter is another trigger, because "after the attack the helicopters would fly over every night with spotlights on the ground, looking for DeAngelo," she recalled.


  DeAngelo pleaded guilty in June to 13 counts of murder and admitted dozens of rapes that were too old to prosecute. His attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.


  Prosecutors said then that he acknowledged a total of 161 crimes involving 48 people. In a court filing made public Monday, they said he harmed 87 victims — an increase in the number of victims previously cited. The higher figure includes victims of crimes that DeAngelo did not publicly admit, Ventura County District Attorney Greg Totten said.


  Testimony from DeAngelo's rape victims in Sacramento County alone will consume a full day. Other rape victims will speak Wednesday, and family members of those murdered will speak Thursday before Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael Bowman formally sentences DeAngelo on Friday.


  Kris Pedretti was 15 when the Golden State Killer attacked her just before Christmas in 1976.


  "This kid who liked to go shopping and do cartwheels on the lawn, that girl was gone," she said about her life after the attack.


  She said she lost her friends, her once profound faith in God, switched schools three times, had two failed marriages, and "did a lot of self- medicating, a lot of poor coping mechanisms."


  It wasn't until DeAngelo's arrest that she sought therapy and changed her life. She's now happily married and described by other survivors as the "den mother" who helps organize pot luck dinners after each of DeAngelo's court appearances. This year she started a Facebook group for sexual assault survivors that now has more than 300 members.


  "He didn't win, I'm not a lost girl. I want to make that clear," Pedretti said.


  Soon after attacking Pedretti, DeAngelo escalated his attacks from targeting single women and girls to humiliating their husbands and boyfriends. He would tie up men and pile dishes on their backs, then threaten to kill both victims if he heard the plates rattle while he raped the woman.


  That's what happened to Bob and Gay Hardwick, who were living together in Stockton in 1978.


  "That's been with me for 42 years now, and in my view that's a long life sentence for someone to serve who didn't deserve to serve it," Gay Hardwick said. "Not one of us, the survivors, deserved to have this kind of violence and hatred and desecration put upon them."


  Victor Hayes, who with his then-girlfriend endured a similar assault in 1977, is now more angry with police and prosecutors than he is with DeAngelo. At the least, Hayes said, DeAngelo should have been forced to publicly admit that he acted under color of authority by using his knowledge of police procedures to avoid arrest.


  DeAngelo was a cop for the first six years of his onslaught — the first three years when he was known as the Visalia Ransacker for about 100 burglaries and one slaying in that San Joaquin Valley farm town; the next three years in the Sierra foothills city of Auburn northeast of Sacramento, until he was fired for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer.


  DeAngelo killed two more people in Sacramento — a couple out walking their dog — but committed most of his murders after he left the police force and moved to Southern California, where he was dubbed the Original Night Stalker.


  Some survivors plan to use props in court to try to break through to DeAngelo, who they think is malingering as a feeble old man in a wheelchair to hide that he remains a mentally and physically sharp, soulless killer.


  Carson-Sandler wore a T-shirt with "Victim Survivor Thriver" to his previous court hearings, and drew applause and laughter during his guilty plea when a prosecutor included her observation that DeAngelo "had a small penis." This week, she plans to wear a new T-shirt that "starts with 'Itsy-Bitsy.'"


  Two families plan videos or slideshows to illustrate their losses.


  Counter-intuitively, Jennifer Carole said she will concentrate on what she called the "silver linings" — the survivors who have grown so close. She is the daughter of victim Lyman Smith, a lawyer who was slain at 43 in Ventura County in 1980. His wife, 33-year-old Charlene Smith, was raped and killed.


  Carole plans to urge everyone to “find a way to do good. I think it is within our power to do good things and take care of each other.”

Virginia lawmakers plan to take up dozens of criminal justice reforms during a special legislative session this week, but one proposal in particular is expected to spark an intense battle: a push to change a law that allows police to charge people with felony assault even if the arresting officers are not seriously hurt. Dantio was arrested in 2013 when she went to a church in the middle of the night to try to see a priest. Dantio, who has mental health issues and was homeless at the time, said she did not immediately respond to Fairfax County police officers who responded to a trespassing call.Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Golden State Killer, a former police officer in California who eluded capture for four decades, faces his victims in court Tuesday on the first of four days of hearings before he is sentenced to life in prison. Joseph DeAngelo has admitted to 13 murders and nearly 50 rapes between 1975 and 1986. All told, he admitted to harming 87 victims in 53 separate crimes scenes spanning 11 California counties in a plea deal that spares him the death penalty. Sixteen of his rape victims plan to confront him Tuesday. A similar number will tell a Sacramento County judge on Wednesday and Thursday how DeAngelo’s crimes changed their lives, before he is formally sentenced Friday.Jane Carson-Sandler says she has served the equivalent of a life sentence in the more than four decades since she became one of the first rape victims of DeAngelo.Now it's DeAngelo's turn to do his time.Carson-Sandler will be among nearly three dozen survivors and family members of victims who plan to confront DeAngelo during an extraordinary four days of court hearings before the 74-year-old is sentenced to life in prison.Beginning Tuesday, some plan to tell of their pain, others of their healing.It's the culmination of a plea deal that will spare DeAngelo the death penalty for 13 murders and numerous sadistic rapes and burglaries that terrorized California for more than a decade. His reign of terror mystified investigators until they used a new form of DNA tracking to arrest him in 2018."Our wounds heal and our scars remain," Carson-Sandler said.Certain things always trigger flashbacks of the night in 1976 when DeAngelo confronted Carson-Sandler with a butcher knife as she snuggled in bed with her 3-year-old son after her husband left for work at a nearby military base. She can't go skiing, for fear she'll see someone in a ski mask like the one DeAngelo wore. The sound of a helicopter is another trigger, because "after the attack the helicopters would fly over every night with spotlights on the ground, looking for DeAngelo," she recalled.DeAngelo pleaded guilty in June to 13 counts of murder and admitted dozens of rapes that were too old to prosecute. His attorneys did not respond to a request for comment.Prosecutors said then that he acknowledged a total of 161 crimes involving 48 people. In a court filing made public Monday, they said he harmed 87 victims — an increase in the number of victims previously cited. The higher figure includes victims of crimes that DeAngelo did not publicly admit, Ventura County District Attorney Greg Totten said.Testimony from DeAngelo's rape victims in Sacramento County alone will consume a full day. Other rape victims will speak Wednesday, and family members of those murdered will speak Thursday before Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael Bowman formally sentences DeAngelo on Friday.Kris Pedretti was 15 when the Golden State Killer attacked her just before Christmas in 1976."This kid who liked to go shopping and do cartwheels on the lawn, that girl was gone," she said about her life after the attack.She said she lost her friends, her once profound faith in God, switched schools three times, had two failed marriages, and "did a lot of self-medicating, a lot of poor coping mechanisms."It wasn't until DeAngelo's arrest that she sought therapy and changed her life. She's now happily married and described by other survivors as the "den mother" who helps organize pot luck dinners after each of DeAngelo's court appearances. This year she started a Facebook group for sexual assault survivors that now has more than 300 members."He didn't win, I'm not a lost girl. I want to make that clear," Pedretti said. Soon after attacking Pedretti, DeAngelo escalated his attacks from targeting single women and girls to humiliating their husbands and boyfriends. He would tie up men and pile dishes on their backs, then threaten to kill both victims if he heard the plates rattle while he raped the woman.That's what happened to Bob and Gay Hardwick, who were living together in Stockton in 1978."That's been with me for 42 years now, and in my view that's a long life sentence for someone to serve who didn't deserve to serve it," Gay Hardwick said. "Not one of us, the survivors, deserved to have this kind of violence and hatred and desecration put upon them."Victor Hayes, who with his then-girlfriend endured a similar assault in 1977, is now more angry with police and prosecutors than he is with DeAngelo. At the least, Hayes said, DeAngelo should have been forced to publicly admit that he acted under color of authority by using his knowledge of police procedures to avoid arrest.DeAngelo was a cop for the first six years of his onslaught — the first three years when he was known as the Visalia Ransacker for about 100 burglaries and one slaying in that San Joaquin Valley farm town; the next three years in the Sierra foothills city of Auburn northeast of Sacramento, until he was fired for shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer.DeAngelo killed two more people in Sacramento — a couple out walking their dog — but committed most of his murders after he left the police force and moved to Southern California, where he was dubbed the Original Night Stalker.Some survivors plan to use props in court to try to break through to DeAngelo, who they think is malingering as a feeble old man in a wheelchair to hide that he remains a mentally and physically sharp, soulless killer.Carson- Sandler wore a T-shirt with "Victim Survivor Thriver" to his previous court hearings, and drew applause and laughter during his guilty plea when a prosecutor included her observation that DeAngelo "had a small penis." This week, she plans to wear a new T-shirt that "starts with 'Itsy-Bitsy.'"Two families plan videos or slideshows to illustrate their losses.
