It is not certain as to whether any study has been undertaken to correlate the dynamics between the smuggling networks and terror elements in the last two decades. No such material is available in public domain, however. The epicentre of such smuggling circuits and the money trail therein must indicate that the investigations in most cases do not maze through the many layers to reach the rock bottom. What are the impediments in this process? When the law adequately empowers an agency for carrying out certain investigations, as under the customs law in this case, why do such episodes keep lingering persistently? Unfortunately, owing to sheer obsession with revenue figures and reporting formalities, our priorities have got manhandled very violently that this issue has been pushed to a ping-pong mode now.

Not too long after trying cold pressed juice for the first time, Karen Odierna had a kind of crazy idea.
   
 She wanted to start a juicing business, but not one where the product would be mass-produced and quantity would be emphasized over quality. She wanted it to be vegan, gluten free, served in glass bottles and made with organic produce 100% of the time -- not just when available.
   
 It was a big risk for the oncology nurse, fitness instructor and self- proclaimed "sugar addict" who was only able to kick her sweets habit after introducing cold-pressed juice into her diet.
   
 But it was a risk that she and her now-fiancee Keith Campbell were willing to take in 2013.
   
 More than six years later, the business they founded, CROP Juice -- short for "cold-pressed raw organic produce" -- has three locations, and sells things like smoothies, juice shots, acai bowls, salads, donuts and more, in addition to their signature cold-pressed juices.
   
 CROP Juice's newest location is in the works for 2480 Stickney Point Road. It will be a relocation of the company's Gulf Gate retail store.
   
 Odierna is a lifelong juicer, and has always been health conscious. Before she discovered cold-pressed juice, she and Campbell were using a Vitamix to make juices at home. But it wasn't until a friend, who had received a breast cancer diagnosis around that time, introduced her to cold-pressed juice that she became inspired to make it her business.
   
 She started playing around with different concoctions at home -- Campbell was her first test subject -- and within six months they were building out their first location in Gulf Gate.
   
 Typically, juice companies make the product in big batches, where they make a recipe for a small yield of leafy greens, she said. The finished product might look green, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there are a lot of greens in there, she said.
   
 They didn't want to be an $8 juice bar, she said. They wanted to be premier and cold press their leafy greens.
   
 "If you're a juicer, you know it takes a lot of leafy greens to make a little bit of juice, and that's where the cost comes in. We juice leafy greens separately, and we hand pour," Odierna said. "If we do a batch of 50 juices, we have to go along the line to do three ounces of leafy greens, then we'll hand pour the ginger. Then we'll hand pour the lemon lime. So, it's not the big batch juicing mentality that most companies have."
   
 One of the biggest challenges has been educating customers about what exactly it is that they're buying. If employees can't tell people what they're buying and why it costs what it costs, customers won't understand why the juice costs between $11 and $14 depending on the amount of organic leafy greens, Campbell said.
   
 "Our customers now come in knowing we vetted it and they don't challenge us anymore, whereas they challenged us all the time early on," he said. "[Odierna] and I talked to probably the first 10,000 people that walked through the doors."
   
 Odierna just quit her nursing job two months ago. She's been working two full- time jobs for the past six years and she and Campbell both work about 70-80 hours a week.
   
 But for them, it was never about the money. They were willing to fail.
   
 "When we opened it was for the sake of doing the right thing. We figured that if we did the right thing by our customers, we'd end up in a good place down the road. But believe me, it's been a long grind for six years," Odierna said.
   
 That mentality of doing right by the community is one of the things fellow entrepreneur Sharon Juraszek said she admires about Odierna and the business she's created. Juraszek owns Fermentlicious, a Sarasota-based organic and probiotic company that makes varieties of sauerkraut and vegan kimchi and sells her product at CROP Juice stores.
   
 She said that there's a lot of demand for organic products like the ones CROP Juice and Fermentlicious make in Sarasota, because some people move here in the first place to live a healthier lifestyle.
   
 "I think it just speaks to what's happening in the whole foods movement. Food is sexy, food is trendy, because as people start to uncover different health issues, reexamining why this is happening," Juraszek said. "Karen is providing organic product that's high quality, in a vessel that is sustainable to the planet."
   
 CROP's next chapter
   
 Today, CROP Juice has three locations -- 2320 Gulf Gate Drive, 8211 Tourist Center Drive in University Town Center and 1605 Main St. in downtown Sarasota.
   
 They plan to expand into the space right next to their current University juice bar, a move that will add about 20 seats to the shop. This will allow them to try a new fast-casual dining menu, including bowls made-to-order.
   
 That shop will serve as a test kitchen for Stickney Point, which Odierna and Campbell said they hope will open by spring. Stickney Point, a relocation of the retail aspect of the Gulf Gate store, will have a pick-up window, where people can grab orders they've placed ahead of time without ever getting out of their cars.
   
 It's possible that the fast-casual dining might eventually make its way to Stickney Point, but the focus at first will be on getting things open, Campbell said.
   
 CROP Juice has a total of about 40 employees. Since the company is well known in the area now and has cultivated a loyal employee base and reputation, it's been easier to find the right talent, he said.
   
 "We worked very very hard to get the team that we have, and we're finally at the point now where we feel like we can open these other stores and have the support of people who work hard and are on the same mission," Campbell said.
   
 That mission is what Odierna said kept her going and determined to start her business, even though many people told her it would never work the way she wanted to do it.
   
 "I wouldn't take no for an answer. I kept coming back [saying] 'no we've gotta do this. People need us, we're all on the caffeine ups and downs and the sugar highs and lows.' We just knew it was something we needed to share with Sarasota."

Reds on Top of the World: FIFA Club World Cup Qatar 2019™

Por Luke Baker, John Irish y Robin Emmott
 LONDRES/PARÍS/BRUSELAS, 7 ene (Reuters) - Alemania, Gran Bretaña y Francia están tratando de mantener vivas las conversaciones con Irán sobre el acuerdo nuclear que firmaron en 2015, pese a que Teherán rompió el acuerdo después de que Estados Unidos mató a su principal comandante militar.
 Irán dijo el domingo que abandonaría los límites de su enriquecimiento de uranio, incumpliendo aún más con el acuerdo que alcanzó con seis grandes potencias, en su primera respuesta formal al asesinato de Qassem Soleimani, en un ataque con aviones no tripulados en el aeropuerto de Bagdad.
 Dado que Irán no dijo qué tan lejos llevaría el enriquecimiento y reafirmó su cooperación con los inspectores de la ONU que monitorizan su actividad nuclear, los funcionarios de la Unión Europea encontraron elementos alentadores en el comunicado y margen para reducir la tensión.
 Los ministros de Asuntos Exteriores de la UE celebrarán una reunión de emergencia en Bruselas el viernes para discutir maneras de salvar el acuerdo a través de la presión si es necesario, un paso que podría llevar a la reimposición de sanciones de la ONU a Teherán.
 "El acuerdo está casi muerto, pero haremos todo lo posible para frenar y contener la pendiente de proliferación (nuclear) que se ha tomado y tratar de salvar lo que se pueda salvar", dijo un diplomático europeo.
 Un portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores alemán dijo que el acuerdo alcanzado entre Irán y Estados Unidos, Rusia, China, Gran Bretaña, Francia y Alemania aún no estaba muerto y que había una comunicación bidireccional.
 "Nuestro objetivo sigue siendo salvar el acuerdo", dijo el portavoz. "Estamos en conversaciones".
 Como ha ocurrido desde que el presidente Donald Trump retiró unilateralmente a Estados Unidos del acuerdo en 2018, Gran Bretaña, Francia y Alemania se encuentran en el papel de mediadores, tratando de convencer a Irán de que cumpla con el pacto y a los estadounidenses de que no serán engañados por Teherán.
 En una declaración conjunta, después del anuncio de Irán sobre el enriquecimiento, la canciller alemana, Angela Merkel, el presidente francés, Emmanuel Macron, y el primer ministro británico, Boris Johnson, dijeron que existía la "necesidad urgente de reducir la escalada".
 "Hacemos un llamado específico a Irán para que se abstenga de más acciones violentas o de proliferación, e instamos a Irán a revertir todas las medidas incompatibles con el JCPOA", dijeron, haciendo referencia al Plan de Acción Integral Conjunto, el nombre formal del acuerdo.
 A raíz del asesinato de Soleimani, que siguió a un aumento de los ataques contra objetivos estadounidenses en Irak por parte de las milicias respaldadas por Irán, la tensión en la región está en su nivel más alto en más de una década, lo que dificulta la mediación.
 Lo que agrava la frustración entre los europeos es el hecho de que no se les advirtió con anticipación de la decisión de Trump de matar a Soleimani, a pesar del potencial desestabilizador que tenía para la región.
 Expertos nucleares interpretaron que la declaración de Irán deja la puerta abierta a las conversaciones. Dijeron que era positivo que Teherán no hubiese amenazado con enriquecer uranio a una pureza fisionable del 20%, un umbral crítico alcanzado antes de 2015 que lo acercó mucho más a la concentración del 90% requerida para una bomba. Además dijo que permitiría las inspecciones de la agencia reguladora de Naciones Unidas.
 "Esto es menos de lo que podría haber sido y deja margen a las negociaciones", dijo Mark Fitzpatrick, miembro asociado y especialista en no proliferación del Instituto Internacional de Estudios Estratégicos. "Es siniestro que Irán declare que no hay límites. Sin embargo, tenemos que ver lo que realmente hace".
 ZANAHORIA Y GARROTE
 Si bien los diplomáticos europeos dijeron que la primera prioridad era evitar una escalada hacia un conflicto armado, están preocupados por lo impredecible del gobierno de Trump y conscientes de que tienen poco que ofrecer a Irán para que cumpla con el acuerdo nuclear.
 En el pasado, Francia propuso líneas de crédito a Teherán para aliviar la presión de las sanciones de Estados Unidos, y Gran Bretaña, Francia y Alemania crearon un mecanismo para el comercio humanitario y de alimentos, pero un año después aún no funciona.
 En general, no han podido cumplir con lo que Irán realmente quiere para permanecer en el acuerdo: el fin de las sanciones y libertad de vender su petróleo. Con la muerte de Soleimani, parece aún menos probable.
 Si se ven obligados a elegir, los europeos tienen pocas opciones más que ponerse del lado del gobierno de Trump.
 En ese sentido, la declaración conjunta de Alemania, Reino Unido y Francia (E3) supuso una línea dura con Irán y sobre su "papel negativo" en la región, además no se refirió en absoluto al ataque estadounidense contra Soleimani. El texto puede satisfacer a Washington, pero agravará la situación con Teherán.
 "Si miras cómo ha reaccionado el E3, se están acercando cada vez más a los estadounidenses. No puedo ver que cambien ese camino, pero también tienen que mantener el diálogo abierto con Irán. Es una cuestión de tiempo", dijo un diplomático occidental.

Com três ataques básicos, a vida de Lulu foi reduzida para 49, e isso sem Aphelios sequer pisar fora da base. Sim, o jogador de Aphelios já estava bem forte na hora dessa jogada, mas muitos concordam que um campeão não deveria ser capaz de fazer isso com um oponente de uma distância tão alta.
 Uma pessoa disse que o ataque melhorado de Calibrum não deveria ter alcance ilimitado, mas um aumento de alcance. Outros apontaram o potencial assustador de Aphelios para causar muito dano de uma vez só e pediram melhorias ou enfraquecimentos a suas habilidades. A Riot Games vai precisar falar sobre isso em breve.
