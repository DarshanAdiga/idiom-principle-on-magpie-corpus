A four-term Democratic representative from Oswego said Thursday she plans to challenge House Speaker Michael Madigan for leadership of the chamber.
   
 Rep. Stephanie Kifowit said Madigan's role in the unfolding Commonwealth Edison scandal prompted her to take the risky step of trying to unseat the longest-serving speaker in the history of the country.
   
 Shortly after the federal investigation into ComEd's activities became public, Kifowit sent a letter to Madigan saying he should step down as speaker.
   
 "I feel he has compromised the integrity of the office of Speaker of the House and has undermined public trust," Kifowit said. "To me, that is not acceptable. It's clear to me he doesn't hold the values I do and I can surmise he falls short of what the public expects of elected officials."
   
 She said it is an opportunity for the House to "move into the future and beyond the scandals and corruption of Michael Madigan."
   
 Madigan released a statement saying he is focused on the upcoming election.
   
 "I have spent my entire career supporting Democrats, regardless of differences in perspective within our party," Madigan said. "We are at a critical juncture in our country and all of us should be focused on coming together to defeat Donald Trump and repair the hate and division he has sown in our communities."
   
 Kifowit said she has spoken to other House Democrats about supporting her bid. She declined to identify any of them because, she said, they fear retaliation. She would also not say how many offered their support.
   
 Kifowit said she is not asking that Madigan resign his seat in the House, but that he should no longer serve as speaker. Since 1993, Madigan has served as speaker for all but two years.
   
 Kifowit was first elected to the House in 2012. She is running unopposed for reelection. She chairs the State Government Administration and Veterans' Affairs committees. She is a full time legislator.
   
 Kent Redfield, a retired political science professor at the University of Illinois Springfield, said Kifowit's announcement could put some pressure on Democratic candidates in closely contested House races in the suburbs. They could be pressed to declare whether they support Kifowit or Madigan for speaker.
   
 "If you're smart you say I don't know who the choices will be," he said.
   
 But he said it also helps keep Madigan's name in the forefront through the election.
   
 "It elevates the Madigan issue which is about all the Republicans have got," he said. "The timing of doing it before the election will not win Kifowit any friends in the Democratic caucus."
   
 Madigan has been under a cloud since ComEd agreed to pay a $200 million fine for giving jobs and contracts to Madigan associates in an effort to curry favor with the powerful House leader. Madigan has not been charged and has denied any wrongdoing.
   
 House Republicans forced creation of an investigating committee to look into the ComEd situation and determine if Madigan behaved in a manner unbecoming of a lawmaker. The three Republican members of the committee held a news conference Thursday to again press for subpoenas to Madigan and several other persons to compel them to testify before the committee about the ComEd case.
   
 During that news conference, the three were asked if they would support Kifowit for speaker in an effort to oust Madigan from the post. The Republicans were non-committal.
   
 Rep. Tom Demmer of Dixon said he wasn't aware of Kifowit reaching out to any Republican House members and that he wouldn't be surprised if other Democrats also got in the running. Rep. Grant Wehrli of Naperville also said other candidates might step forward. Rep. Deanne Mazzochi of Elmhurst the issue isn't only a different speaker, but different House rules that are fairer to the minority party
   
 The Republicans also said they are pushing ahead with trying to issue subpoenas to Madigan and other potential witnesses. Rep. Emanuel "Chris" Welch, D-Hillside, chair of the Special Investigations Committee II, said he thought it was too early in the process to issue subpoenas and that he hadn't seen an draft copies of subpoenas. The Republicans said they have now submitted those drafts to Welch and are waiting for his reply.

 “And I wanted to change that. So I sat down with myself and said I think I want to have my own modelling agency and have completely diverse models, all different shapes and sizes, all different skin tones.”
 “There is a huge gap in the market for this sort of agency right now especially in Ireland it’s time for a change.

ROCCA DE' GIORGI, Italy (AP) — Her hands were hardly visible, so quickly did they press the clippers before dropping grape clusters into red plastic bins. Some distance behind her, in the next row over, Italian students subbing in due to a pandemic-fueled worker shortage tried vainly to catch up.
 Though from a Romanian region famed for its wine, Alexandra Ichim had never worked in vineyards before traveling to Italy's Lombardy region for the September grape harvest, known in Italian as the vendemmia — the pay is too low in Romania and the working conditions too harsh, she says. For the Italian work, the 20-year-old came on a 12-hour bus ride and returned by plane to her native Arad region when the harvest was done.
 Eastern European seasonal workers, led by Romanians, are considered essential to getting food on the table throughout the continent. Their willingness to work hard in uncertain jobs for lower wages is sought after abroad, and their income is desperately needed at home. At a time when travel for work is seen as dangerous for everyone, they are among the world’s last regular border- crossers. Unlike the farms that so desperately need them, there are no subsidies from the European Union or special protection should they fall sick.
 Around one in five Romanians works abroad. Italy is the top destination for 1.2 million of them, with France and Spain not far behind. When coronavirus struck, around a million returned to their homeland, ignoring the Romanian president’s plea to stay in place and avoid bringing the virus already raging in Western Europe. For many, it was the longest homecoming of their adult lives.
 Workers can make around 1,200 euros a month working eight-hour days during the vendemmia in Italy, versus around 700 euros for a month of 10-hour days in Romania.
 Ichim has lived off and on in Lombardy with her mother since 2006 and speaks flawless Italian. She was in Romania with her father when the coronavirus outbreak first struck Italy earlier this year, working in a steering wheel factory, which later sent her home during Romania's virus lockdown. She left to join her mother nearly as soon as the borders reopened. At the time, Romania’s infection rate was low and no quarantine was required, but within a few weeks, a 14-day quarantine was required in Italy for travelers from Romania and Bulgaria.

Just like with humans, it can be tempting to put your dog on a crash diet if they have gained a lot of weight that you want to help them lose quickly. But dieting too much and too quickly can have the opposite effect on your pet. Simply reducing the amount of food that your dog eats and increasing the amount of exercise that they do should be enough to help your dog lose weight, and bear in mind that losing weight slowly and steadily is always safer. Putting your dog on a crash diet could prevent them from getting the essential nutrients that they need.

Now, just a few months shy of her 40th birthday, she has little to show for that promise besides a play that she's been working on for ages. She pays the bills by teaching drama at a local high school and spends a lot of time commiserating with her talent agent and longtime buddy Archie, played by Korean American actor Peter Kim in a sly riff on the gay-best-friend trope.
 Archie urges Radha to seize any and every opportunity, even if it may require some compromise. At a party one night, he steers her toward J. Whitman, a powerful theater producer played with delicious smarminess by Tony Award- winner Reed Birney. After some tussling, Whitman eventually agrees to produce Radha's play, which follows a Black couple in a fast-gentrifying Harlem. But he demands numerous changes, including the introduction of a white co-lead in order to show the face of gentrification itself and, of course, draw a larger audience.
 Blank clearly delights in skewering the tone-deaf condescension of white men who fancy themselves cultural gatekeepers. But one of the reasons _The Forty- Year-Old Version_ is so disarming is that Blank saves the toughest criticism for herself. She lets us see her character grapple with deep insecurities about her talent, her calling and her future — sometimes with tears, but more often with a well-timed, self-deprecating jab.
 At one point, Radha decides to abandon theater and reinvent herself as a rapper, seizing upon a long-ago passion that she hopes will tie her more closely to a strong community of Black artists. And so begins a wide-ranging tour of New York's hip-hop scene, from a boxing ring in the Bronx where female rappers go ferociously head-to-head, to a Brooklyn club where Radha does some recordings with a gruff but sensitive DJ, played by Oswin Benjamin. Radha's talent in this arena is more than apparent, even if her nerves sometimes get the better of her — like when she freezes onstage in front of an audience that includes several of her high-school students.
 If you cringe for Radha in that moment, as I did, consider it proof of how deeply Blank has secured your emotional investment in her journey. That's no small feat, considering all the crowd-pleasing underdog-drama clichés the story could have stumbled into but somehow avoids.
 A more obvious telling of this story might have ended with Radha discovering her true calling as a rapper, or figuring out how to put on a successful version of her play that stays true to her creative vision. But Blank seems less interested in clear resolutions than in examining how these two distinct worlds, theater and hip-hop, have shaped her complex identity as an artist. She doesn't feel entirely at home in either space. And yet her work, at its best, becomes a bold synthesis of both.
 As fast and funny as much of it is, _The Forty-Year-Old Version_ also has a rich vein of melancholy. There's an elegiac quality to the black-and-white images, which might bring to mind vintage New York pictures like _Manhattan_ , _Shadows_ and _She's Gotta Have It_ , Spike Lee's equally auspicious 1986 debut. As it happens, _She's Gotta Have It_ recently spawned a TV series for which Blank wrote a few episodes. But it would be a mistake to squeeze her into any kind of mold based on her influences. Radha Blank already has a voice that is gloriously her own, whichever version of it we hear next.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With just a month to go until the election, President Donald Trump had a busy schedule during the week the coronavirus hit home with him. Trump tweeted early Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus.


--DocBreak--
The positive test reading for the leader of the world’s largest economy heaps uncertainty onto a growing pile of unknowns investors are grappling with, first among them how it might affect the Nov. 3 election and American policies on trade, tariffs and many other issues beyond then.“To say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,” Rabobank said in a commentary. “Anyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this US election campaign.”Trading in Asia was thin, with markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed. The Nikkei 225 index shed strong early gains, losing 0.7% to 23,029.90 after the Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed trading following an all day outage due to a technical failure.Reports that the Japanese government is preparing new stimulus measures to help the economy recover from a prolonged downturn worsened by the coronavirus pandemic provided only a temporary lift. Prices fell further after Trump’s announcement.Australia’s benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 1.4% to 5,79.50. Shares in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia also fell.On Thursday, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 ended the day 0.5% higher, at 3,380.80, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% to 27,816.90 and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.4% to 11,326.51, as big tech- oriented stocks propped up the market, much as they have through the pandemic.Such big swings have become typical recently, as investors handicap the chances of a deal on Capitol Hill to send more cash to Americans, restore jobless benefits for laid-off workers and deliver assistance to airlines and other industries hit particularly hard by the pandemic.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continued their talks on Thursday, but no breakthrough arrived before stock trading ended on Wall Street. Instead, there were only hopes that were periodically raised and dashed as government officials took turns criticizing each other.“Things remain fluid; we all know what is at stake if this deal does not go through before markets sundown, it is unlikely to be pretty ugly,” Stephen Innes of Axi said in a commentary.Beyond potential political developments, investors will be watching for job figures due out Friday. Data released Thursday painted a mixed picture for the economy, with one report showing the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits last week fell to 837,000 from 873,000. That was less than economists expected, but incredibly high compared with before the pandemic.Consumer spending was higher than forecast in August, which is key because it’s the main driver of the U.S. economy. But personal incomes weakened by more than expected last month, and growth in the country’s manufacturing sector also fell short of forecasts.With airlines and other major companies announcing layoffs and furloughs, another round of economic aid from Congress is seen as crucial. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have worked effectively together in the past, helping to drive through the previous economic rescue approved by Congress in March. But the country’s deepening partisan divide has stymied progress, with the presidential election only about a month away.The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 0.66% from 0.67% late Thursday.U.S. benchmark crude lost $1.15 to $37.57 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Clashes raged between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces on Friday despite calls for a ceasefire, as French President Emmanuel Macron warned Turkey against the alleged deployment of jihadists to the war zone.
 Macron said intelligence reports had established that 300 fighters from "jihadist groups" in Syria had passed through Turkey en route to Azerbaijan, saying that "a red line has been crossed" and demanding an explanation.
 Ankara is backing its longtime ally Baku in the fighting over Nagorny Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian province that broke away from Azerbaijan in a bitterly fought war in the 1990s.
 Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in a simmering conflict for decades over the region and new fighting that erupted on Sunday has been the heaviest in decades.
 Nearly 200 people have been confirmed killed, including more than 30 civilians, and there are fears of the fighting expanding into an all-out, multi-front war that could suck in regional powers Turkey and Russia.
 As the clashes entered a sixth day on Friday, the defence ministry of Karabakh's separatist government reported the deaths of 54 more of its troops.
 It said there was fighting all along the frontline after "a relatively calmer night".
 Azerbaijan's defence ministry also said the fighting was ongoing, and both sides claimed to have inflicted heavy losses.
 Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev have rejected calls for talks.
 \- Russia, US, France appeal for talks -
 Russia and Western countries have pressed for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations, while Turkey has been fierce in its support for Baku, accusing Armenia of occupying Azerbaijani lands.
 Macron issued his warning to Ankara at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, urging "all NATO partners to face up to the behaviour of a NATO member".
 In a joint appeal on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump and Macron urged the two sides to return to negotiations aimed at resolving their longstanding territorial dispute.
 Russia also suggested it was making progress in diplomatic efforts with Turkey.
 It said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu had confirmed they were ready for "close coordination" to stabilise the situation.
 Yerevan is in a military alliance of ex-Soviet countries led by Moscow and has accused Turkey of directly supporting Azerbaijan in the fighting, by deploying aircraft in support of Baku and sending mercenaries from northern Syria to join the fighting.
 Armenia has recorded the deaths of 158 soldiers and 13 civilians since Sunday. Azerbaijan has not reported any military casualties but said 19 civilians were killed after Armenian shelling.
 Karabakh's declaration of independence from Azerbaijan sparked a war in the early 1990s that claimed 30,000 lives, but it is still not recognised as independent by any country, including Armenia.
 Armenia and Karabakh declared martial law and military mobilisation Sunday, while Azerbaijan imposed military rule and a curfew in large cities.
 Talks to resolve the conflict have largely stalled since a 1994 ceasefire agreement.

JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura has warned residents against complacency as the country tries to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections.
 The province recently recorded a 6% increase in infections in the space of just one week.
 The premier said that a resurgence in COVID-19 infections would be devastating for Gauteng's economy at a time when it needed to rebuild.
 Gauteng has the most COVID-19 cases in the country, recording close to 220,000 infections since the start of the outbreak.
 There are currently over 19,000 active cases in the province, down from 20,276 a week earlier and Makhura said that the province was still not out of the woods.
 Makura has warned that the province could see a second wave of infections during level one of the lockdown.
 “The only thing that will make it easier for us to continue to contain the spread of COVID-19 and ensure that the numbers are lower is the conduct and behaviour of the people of our province. It doesn’t mean we will not experience another wave. We may be doing well, we are in level one. October, November could see a new wave.”
 Makhura said that while the provincial government had increased its efforts to rebuild livelihoods and save lives, the easing of restrictions on social and economic activity meant that the transmission of COVID-19 remained high.

It was back in 2016 that I bought King’s Lynn Town Football Club – in some ways it feels like I have been here for decades!
 But now, as the season begins, I guess I am 90pc relieved that we got there and I am over the moon for the fans and the town that we have actually achieved something that has been elusive for the club for so many years.
 It is a great honour to be playing at the highest level of non-league football. It is great we have managed to put the club on the map again, where it deserves to be, and I am just pleased for everyone concerned – the players, the manager and all his staff. It is not the end of the journey, but hopefully it is the start of a new journey that we want to continue.
 Of course, there are not going to be fans in the ground, but there will be a presence. A fan contacted me and asked if he could put his flag up inside the ground and I thought, yes, let’s open up the ground and let them in, so that is what we did and it means at least a part of our support will be there in spirit with us.
 Whenever I think about the fans not being here, it upsets me, it doesn’t get any better. One of the reasons Chris Henderson gave when he left was that he wanted to play in front of 6,000 fans at Notts County and big crowds at The Walks, but that has been taken away from him. That is the draw to be part of it. Players get a lot of encouragement off the fans and it moves them on, especially at times in a game when they perhaps start to lose a bit of energy and sag a little bit – you play two games in a week and you have a few games on the trot etc, you need the fans to help you out and that is not going to happen.
 And also there is the historic side of it – we want the fans to be there as part of it. We have done all we can do. We want people to still be part of the club and we need to engage with them as much as we can. That is why we have produced a programme. It isn’t so much a money-making exercise, but we have also done it to engage with the fans so they can get as much of the match experience as we can give them.
 Really, you just feel so helpless – and people know how ridiculous the situation is. Next Tuesday night we are allowed 600 fans in for the FA Youth Cup game but we are not allowed anyone for the opening game of our National League season. It doesn’t make any sense, there is no logic to it and that makes it harder to swallow.
 But it is what it is and there is nothing we can do about it – we just have to get through it and lobby for the return of fans as soon as is humanly possible.
 I would happily have accepted being allowed 1,000 fans inside the ground. We would have had to put prices up, but not massively. We would have let season tickets holders in for what they paid for, and we would just have increased it a little bit for the rest with a one-price ticket to get in, although it wouldn’t have been as good financially, of course. I think we would have had a crowd of 3,000 for this game against Yeovil – they would have brought 300 and King’s Lynn fans would have put 2,700 on the gate. So, clearly you would have had one third of the attendance and you couldn’t charge triple the price. But it would have been a help had we got them in, not just financially, but to be part of it and have a little bit of noise about the place. As I was saying to someone the other day, the fans make it - the smell of the burgers and the onions, it is all part of the theatre of football, the experience of it, watching things happen, laughing - it has been taken away from us and it has become soulless. It is a fan-driven game at this level and we want it to remain that way and it is just wrong they are not allowed to take part.
 Fortunately, we are live on BT Sport and national exposure for King’s Lynn doesn’t come around very often. I don’t know of a league game that was televised live from here. In the nicest possible way I am tired of hearing about the FA Cup game against Oldham 14 years ago – we have got to create history, we can’t just have old history all the time. We can’t just look back and remember that 14 years ago we were on TV. To have our little old ground, our lovely old stadium pictured across people’s living rooms on a Saturday evening has got that bit of romance to it.
 I am so pleased that is happening, but I am probably not as motivated as I should be because of the absence of fans. But I am pleased we are creating our own history, that we are putting ourselves on the map and obviously if we do well this season we will hopefully appear more than once and it will be nice if we get another chance down the road – with fans in the ground with us.
 It seems a long time ago, when we kicked off last season at Guiseley. Who would have thought that we’d be here now, waiting to go live on TV?
 We look over our shoulders and see some of the clubs now below us – the likes of Kettering, Hereford, York – and it shows you how far we have come as a football club. There are a lot of York Citys ahead of us this year again – so who knows where we will end up?

CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - A big problem in a local neighborhood has people asking 19 News to help Troubleshoot what they call a dangerous intersection.Imagine trying to navigate it without the safety of a traffic light?19 News was at the intersection of East 116th Street and Forest Avenue on Cleveland’s East Side when a car laid on its horn as another vehicle pulled out in front of on-coming traffic. Neighbors say this near miss is not the first one, and it won’t be the last because there’s already been at least seven or eight crashes at this intersection recently.Antonia Stowes lives right down the street and says when she brings one of her patients to the busy convenience store located at the intersection, navigating traffic can be frightening. “I’m so scared somebody is going to get killed right here. We have had multiple accidents here; it’s dangerous for the kids,” Stowes said.Stowes said she called the 19 News Troubleshooter Hotline because it’s time that someone takes action.“There used to be a street light but when they was doing construction for the streets they took down this light and the one a little farther down on Honeydale, and it’s been over two years,” Stowes said.About two years too long, according to neighbor Maureen Mims. She says she feels like she’s taking her life into her own hands just crossing the street. Because she says, cars use the road like a raceway.“There’s several people in wheelchairs like this that travel this area, and a lot of times a lot of people are not courteous. They don’t pay attention to the walk signs,” Mims said.19 News contacted Cleveland Ward 4 Councilman Ken Johnson by telephone. He says, taking the lights down during the paving project and not putting them back up was a decision made by the state’s traffic and engineering department.But residents say what may sound good on paper isn’t working out here on a busy street, just down the road from a school.A stop sign knocked down during one accident at the intersection has only recently been put back up to help control some traffic. “Memorial Day it was terrible, we had back to back accidents here,” Stowes told 19 News.Now, these neighbors are hoping their concerns won’t continue to fall on deaf ears. “Put the stoplight back, and you know what else they can do – at these little crosswalks here put flashers there and enforce it,” Mims said.Councilman Johnson has assured 19 News that he will contact ODOT’s traffic and engineering department first thing Friday morning.Stay with 19 News for updates on this developing story.Copyright 2020 WOIO.

The Chennai Super Kings (CSK) bowling attack has left something to be desired and the veteran Piyush Chawla was called up after the first match in order to bolster the leg-spin department. With the CSK bowling not really coming to terms with the challenge, Chawla's experience could well be a major factor. For SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH), the batting was under the microscope, so it was inevitable that Kane Williamson would see action as soon as he was fit. He did so against Delhi Capitals and made quite a significant contribution to SRH's win.

The positive test reading for the leader of the world’s largest economy heaps uncertainty onto a growing pile of unknowns investors are grappling with, first among them how it might affect the Nov. 3 election and American policies on trade, tariffs and many other issues beyond then.
 “To say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,” Rabobank said in a commentary. “Anyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this US election campaign.”
 Trading in Asia was thin, with markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed. The Nikkei 225 index shed strong early gains, losing 0.7% to 23,029.90 after the Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed trading following an all day outage due to a technical failure.
 Reports that the Japanese government is preparing new stimulus measures to help the economy recover from a prolonged downturn worsened by the coronavirus pandemic provided only a temporary lift. Prices fell further after Trump’s announcement.
 Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 slipped 1.4% to 5,79.50. Shares in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia also fell.
 On Thursday, the benchmark S&P 500 ended the day 0.5% higher, at 3,380.80, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% to 27,816.90 and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.4% to 11,326.51, as big tech-oriented stocks propped up the market, much as they have through the pandemic.
 Such big swings have become typical recently, as investors handicap the chances of a deal on Capitol Hill to send more cash to Americans, restore jobless benefits for laid-off workers and deliver assistance to airlines and other industries hit particularly hard by the pandemic.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin continued their talks on Thursday, but no breakthrough arrived before stock trading ended on Wall Street. Instead, there were only hopes that were periodically raised and dashed as government officials took turns criticizing each other.
 “Things remain fluid; we all know what is at stake if this deal does not go through before markets sundown, it is unlikely to be pretty ugly,” Stephen Innes of Axi said in a commentary.
 Beyond potential political developments, investors will be watching for job figures due out Friday. Data released Thursday painted a mixed picture for the economy, with one report showing the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits last week fell to 837,000 from 873,000. That was less than economists expected, but incredibly high compared with before the pandemic.
 Consumer spending was higher than forecast in August, which is key because it’s the main driver of the U.S. economy. But personal incomes weakened by more than expected last month, and growth in the country’s manufacturing sector also fell short of forecasts.
 With airlines and other major companies announcing layoffs and furloughs, another round of economic aid from Congress is seen as crucial. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have worked effectively together in the past, helping to drive through the previous economic rescue approved by Congress in March. But the country’s deepening partisan divide has stymied progress, with the presidential election only about a month away.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 0.66% from 0.67% late Thursday.
 U.S. benchmark crude lost $1.15 to $37.57 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gave up $1.50 to $38.72 on Thursday. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $1.23 to $39.70 per barrel.
 The dollar weakened to 105.13 Japanese yen from 105.54 yen. The euro weakened to $1.1733 from $1.1747.

“I don’t think we quite hit the nail on the head in qualifying,” said Kellett, adding, “just lacking a bit of rear stability, struggling a little bit and didn’t quite get everything out of the reds (Firestone tires). Unfortunate that we’re not starting further up the grid, but I think we definitely learned some stuff in practice and I think we’ve got a solid race car. We’ve consistently had better race pace than qualifying pace this year so we’ll be looking to make spots on track and in pit lane, make some smart moves, get some passes done early on. The No. 41 crew will be solid in pit lane so hopefully we can jump some spots and move up for the race. For Saturday’s qualifying we’ll be having a look at what Seb and Charlie were doing today and see if we can learn anything and if we can all get better as a team. I think there’s definitely some potential there so looking forward to seeing what we can learn.”

It was back in 2016 that I bought King's Lynn Town Football Club - in some ways it feels like I have been here for decades! But now, as the season begins, I guess I am 90pc relieved that we got there and I am over the moon for the fans and the town that we have actually achieved something that has been elusive for the club for so many years. It is a great honour to be playing at the highest level of non-league football.

The agency says deaths fell 2% last year, to 36,096. That’s 739 fewer than the 36,835 fatalities reported to the agency in 2019.The decrease came even though vehicle miles traveled increased by nearly 1%, reducing the fatality rate to 1.1 per 100 million miles traveled. That was the lowest since 2014.The agency says pedestrian deaths fell 2.7%, bicyclist fatalities dropped 2.9% and motorcycle deaths dropped 0.5%. Deaths in passenger vehicles fell 2.8%.But deaths in crashes involving heavy trucks fell by just one, from 5,006 in 2018 to 5,005 last year.Estimates by the agency show that traffic deaths in the first half of this year fell 2% from the same period in 2019, to 16,550. But traffic volumes fell more than the number of fatal crashes, increasing the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled to 1.25. That’s up from 1.06 for the first half of 2019.James Owens, NHTSA’s deputy administrator, said the agency is encouraged by the overall declines, but concerned because of a trend since April of increased fatality rates. “Now more than ever we should be watching ourselves for safe driving practices and encouraging others to do the same,” Owens said in a statement.The agency issued a report saying that during the height of the coronavirus restrictions with less traffic on the roads, drivers took more risks including speeding, failing to wear seat belts, and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Average speeds increased, and incidents with people caught driving at extreme speeds rose, NHTSA said.A study of people injured or killed in crashes who were treated at five large trauma centers found that from mid-March to mid-July, almost two- thirds of drivers tested positive for at least one drug, including marijuana, alcohol or opioids. NHTSA said the number of drivers testing positive for opioids nearly doubled after mid-March, compared with the previous six months. Marijuana use was up 50%.The Governors Highway Safety Association, a group of state highway safety officials, said speeding is a factor in nearly one-third of traffic deaths. But association members reported that during the height of the pandemic, states and communities reduced health risks to police officers by limiting traffic stops.“This may have led some motorists to believe they could get away with dangerous and aggressive driving, despite the threat to themselves and everyone on the road,” the association said in a statement.The data match trends noted by @GHSAHQ earlier this year. We would have expected traffic deaths to be down drastically given much less driving, but sadly, that hasn&#39;t happened. We have much more work to do. https://t.co/iwAT2w8Qqv&mdash; Jonathan Adkins (@jraindc) October 1, 2020

KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine - House District 9 candidates Traci Gere and H. Stedman Seavey both name the COVID-19 pandemic as the state's most pressing issue this election.
   
 Gere, a Democrat, and Seavey, a Republican, agree on that top priority. But they emphasized differing aspects of how the pandemic is impacting people's lives and how the government should respond.
   
 If elected, Gere said she would focus on making sure Mainers have access to affordable health care.
   
 "For people who are being affected by the pandemic in some way -- whether it's a change in their job status, or a change in how many hours they're getting at work -- they really need to make sure they're able to access health care," Gere said.
   
 Gere also said the state has to help people get through pandemic by prioritizing services that, in addition to health care, include education, employment supports, public safety, and revenue sharing with municipalities.
   
 "I would work to protect those items," Gere said. "I would also work to tighten our belts in less essential areas ... I think that in tight times we may need to look at continuing to look at management salaries, keeping those down in this time frame, and some of the less essential categories that might include some maintenance that can be just deferred."
   
 Seavey said the economic strains of the pandemic have created a financial shortfall in the state totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, making the next two-year budget process especially challenging.
   
 "There's going to have to be a lot of decisions made on how to deal with that," Seavey said. "You certainly can't recoup all of the money through taxes. I mean, these people are working less, earning less, and you can't expect them to come up with tax money to support the government."
   
 Seavey said the government is "supposed to support the people to a certain extent," but paring down the state budget is paramount, especially when one considers how COVID-19 is impacting so many areas, from education to retirement.
   
 "Every aspect of a person's life is affected," Seavey said.
   
 Assessing the governor's response
   
 Seavey said he is troubled that the State Legislature has not been meeting during the pandemic.
   
 "That's unheard of, almost," he said. "How long can just the governor run the state by herself?"
   
 Seavey said Gov. Janet Mills has been listening primarily to Nivah Shah, director of the state's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, on how to handle the pandemic.
   
 "She has two ears, and I think they're both being taken up by the CDC director," Seavey said. "I think she needs to free up one ear."
   
 "You've got to be safe, but I just think the pendulum has swung a little bit far towards safety," Seavey said. "I'm not saying loosen everything up. All I'm saying is listen to other policymakers. Listen to the legislature, to business leaders, to nonprofit leaders."
   
 Gere gave Mills high marks for her handling of the crisis, saying she has taken a science-based approach, relying on data and medical expertise, listening to people from around the state and adjusting to conditions in real time to keep people safe.
   
 "Her team has focused us on those actions that limit the spread of the virus," Gere said. "I would say they have done a remarkably good job at steering us through this situation."
   
 Their business experience
   
 Seavey owned and operated Bradbury Brothers Market in Kennebunkport for 25 years, an experience he said acquainted him with the issues that are important to others.
   
 "What happens is that you meet people from every single walk of life, every endeavor, every possible aspect of life," he said. "And they've all got their stories. They've all got good times and bad times. I've been very pleased to understand where people are coming from."
   
 Seavey, who has served in the legislature before, said such experiences have helped him in his role as legislator during his previous terms.
   
 "You vote on just thousands of pieces of legislation every year," he said. "These experiences that I've had meeting and dealing with so many people through the store have helped me do that."
   
 Gere is the founder and manager of Make It KPT, a retail store in Lower Village that promotes local artisans and fosters creativity for children and adults. She said her experiences in business have taught her that data and facts are important for making decisions.
   
 Gere said her business career also has taught her to be flexible and adapt to changing conditions.
   
 "That's necessary in business as well as in making decisions for government and how we are serving the people in our districts and our state," she said.
   
 Gere also said her experience in business and in serving in nonprofits and other organizations has given her a "big-picture perspective to solving problems."
   
 Hitting the campaign trail
   
 Both candidates have tailored their campaigns to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 Gere said she is still knocking on doors but in a distant way, standing back at least 10 feet in the resident's yard during conversations. She wears a mask. She also is calling voters on the phone.
   
 "I'm a very active listener," she said. "I ask a lot of questions. I make sure I come away from conversations with understanding."
   
 Seavey said he is campaigning through social media, flyers, letters to the editor, and newspaper ads, "pretty much what you do normally, anyway." He wears a mask and socially distances when out and about, he said. Going door to door is difficult at this time, however, Seavey added.
   
 "People are still very concerned," he said. "COVID is a very serious situation. I think we're going to scale back on door to door a little bit."
   
 Veteran versus newcomer
   
 Voters first elected Seavey to serve the district in the Maine House of Representatives in 1982. He was reelected in 1984, 1986 and 1988. He stepped away in 1990 to focus on operating his store with his cousin.
   
 Seavey returned to the Maine House for two more terms in 2014 and 2016. He opted not to run in 2018, so he could focus on a health concern that earlier this year he said is now under control.
   
 "Here I am, full of vinegar, and ready to go at it again," he said back in March.
   
 Seavey graduated from Kennebunk High School and the University of Southern Maine, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science. He and his wife, Betsy Perrow, a retired elementary school teacher, have been married 47 years. They have two grown children and two grandchildren. They now own and operate the Goose Rocks Beach General Store and Gift Shop.
   
 Before serving in the State House, Seavey served as a Kennebunkport selectman for five years.
   
 Gere is seeking her first term in the legislature. She has served on Regional School Unit 21 task forces that helped address enrollment imbalances in the school district and created renovation plans for Kennebunk High School. She is a member of the Kennebunk, Kennebunkport and Arundel Chamber of Commerce and the Kennebunkport Business Association. She also has been an active member of Kennebunkport's Democratic Committee.
   
 Gere is a graduate of Brown University and received an MBA from Boston University. She and her husband, Nick, have two sons.
   
 Maine House District 9 is comprised of Kennebunkport and parts of Kennebunk and Biddeford.

Yet since the early days of the pandemic, experts have questioned the health and safety protocols at the White House and asked why more wasn’t being done to protect the commander in chief. Trump continued to shake hands with visitors long after public health officials were warning against it and he initially resisted being tested. He has been reluctant to practice his own administration’s social distancing guidelines for fear of looking weak, including refusing under almost all circumstances to wear a mask in public.
 Trump is not the only major world leader known to have contracted the virus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical workers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel self-isolated after a doctor who gave her a vaccination tested positive for the virus, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau worked from home after his wife fell ill.
 The White House got its first COVID-19 scare in early March when at least three people who later tested positive came in close proximity to the president at his private Florida club. That included members of the Brazilian president’s delegation, including the Brazilian chargé d’affaires, who sat at Trump’s dinner table.
 In mid-March, as the virus continued to spread across the country, the White House began taking the temperature of everyone entering the White House complex, and in April, it began administering rapid COVID-19 tests to all those in close proximity to the president, with staffers being tested about once a week. The frequent tests gave some staff the false impression the complex was safe from the virus, and few, as a result, followed recommended safety protocols, including wearing masks.
 But then the bubble broke.
 On May 7, the White House announced that a member of the military serving as one of the president’s personal valets tested positive for the virus, followed a day later by a positive diagnosis for Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary.
 Even then, Trump said he was “not worried” about the virus spreading in the White House. But officials again stepped up safety protocols for the complex, directing everyone entering the West Wing to wear a mask.
 “I think it’s very well contained, actually,” Trump told reporters on May 11.
 But by June, concerns at the White House had dissipated once again, with few staffers bothering with masks even as more and more people tested positive for the virus, including campaign staffers preparing for a Tulsa rally and Secret Service agents.
 On July 3rd, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tested positive in South Dakota before an Independence Day fireworks show at Mount Rushmore. Guilfoyle, a former Fox News personality who works for Trump’s campaign, had not flown on Air Force One and had not been in direct contact with the president, though she had had contact with numerous top GOP officials.
 In July, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, tested positive.
 While there is currently no evidence that Trump is seriously ill, the positive test also raises questions about what would happen if he were to become incapacitated due to illness. The Constitution’s 25th Amendment spells out the procedures under which a president can declare themselves “unable to discharge the powers and duties” of the presidency. If he were to make that call, Trump would transmit a written note to the Senate president pro tempore, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pence would serve as acting president until Trump transmitted “a written declaration to the contrary.”
 The vice president and a majority of either the Cabinet or another body established by law, can also declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, in which case Pence would “immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President” until Trump could provide a written declaration to the contrary.

While the American film industry still has a long way to go in nurturing movies made by women and people of color, the Sundance Film Festival has long provided an important platform for marginalized voices. This is the festival that recently introduced us to pictures like _The Farewell_, from Lulu Wang, and _Clemency_ , from Chinonye Chukwu. Eight years ago, Ava DuVernay premiered her film _Middle of Nowhere_ at Sundance and became the first Black woman in the festival's history to win best director for an American drama.
 This year, Radha Blank became the second Black woman to earn that prize for her first feature, _The Forty-Year-Old Version_. It was a worthy winner, not just because it's a terrific movie, but also because it's specifically about the challenges of making meaningful, personal art from an underrepresented perspective.
 Blank's artistry has many facets: She has a sharp ear for comic dialogue and an exquisite eye, having shot this movie on gorgeous black-and-white 35-millimeter film. She also gives a very fine performance as a fictionalized version of herself, also named Radha Blank — a struggling artist from Harlem, who was hailed years earlier as a promising playwright.

The final stage of the French 5G tender ended on 01 October, completing the sale of 310 MHz of spectrum in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band. Telecom regulator Arcep said that proceeds amounted to EUR 2.79 billion, which compares with the floor price of EUR 2.17 billion set by the government at the end of last year. Market leader Orange accounted for the highest spend, at EUR 854 million for 90 MHz of spectrum. Altice France subsidiary SFR acquired 80 MHz for EUR 728 million, while Bouygues Telecom and Free Mobile both secured 70 MHz for EUR 602 million.
 In the first phase of the award, the French government had agreed to sell 200 MHz at a set price of EUR 1.4 billion, with each of the four network operators spending EUR 350 million for a block of 50 MHz. After a pause due to the Covid-19 health crisis, the regulator was asked to oversee an auction for the remaining 110 MHz of spectrum available, sold in equal-size chunks (10 MHz) at a starting price of EUR 70 million per block.
 Bidding lasted just three days, with the unit price rising from EUR 70 million to EUR 126 million by the end of the final round. In addition to the initial 50 MHz, Orange secured the most spectrum in the auction (40 MHz), followed by SFR (30 MHz). Bouygues Telecom and Free Mobile were each attributed two blocks (20 MHz).
 Spectrum acquired in the auction will have to be paid for over four years, while the set price of EUR 350 million will be spread over the fifteen-year duration of the licences, which can be extended by a further five years under conditions set by Arcep. The final amount spent in the tender will be known at the completion of the last step of the award process, in which the four participants will bid in a "positioning" auction to determine where their spectrum will be placed in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band.
 French operators will also be able to rely on other frequencies for their 5G deployments. These include the 700 MHz band, which was awarded by Arcep in 2015, and in future 26 GHz frequencies, still to be allocated.
 ## A “well balanced” result encouraging investment
 Orange commented that the total amount raised in the tender remains reasonable compared with other large European countries, such as Germany. CEO Stephane Richard said that the company was very satisfied with the auction process, noting that the result was "well balanced" and encouraged operators to invest.
 The rules set by Arcep capped the amount of spectrum per operator at 100 MHz, including the 50 MHz block sold at a set price. Industry's expectations were that this limit, coupled with the decision to auction blocks of equal size (10 MHz each), could keep a lid on auction bids.
 Including 90 MHz in the 3.4-3.8 GHz band, Orange retains the largest portfolio of frequencies in the French market with 257 MHz overall, while SFR defends its runner-up position holding nearly 245 MHz across all bands.

Trump is not the only major world leader known to have contracted the virus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical workers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel self-isolated after a doctor who gave her a vaccination tested positive for the virus, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau worked from home after his wife fell ill.


--DocBreak--
It is noteworthy that Trump issued a government order in June, which led to a temporary moratorium on H-1B visas and other visas issued to foreigners including H-2B, J&L visas by the end of this year. The president argued that America needs to save and protect the jobs of its domestic workers, especially when millions of jobs have been lost due to the Kovid-19 epidemic.

The retracement in the price has also been reflected in the exchange inflow as per the data by Santiment. Earlier this week, the exchange inflow of XRP surged to 44 million. The value of XRP increased from the support at $0.22 to highs close to $0.25. However, the decrease in the influx of XRP is occurring in tandem with the described breakdown. Unless a reversal in the inflow comes into the picture, XRP might continue to explore the rabbit hole.

Building Amesbury back into title contention will take time, but Doherty already has the buy in from her players. The Indians return eight starters and 17 varsity players overall from last fall’s team, and Doherty said they spent the summer working out almost every day to prepare for the season — even though none of them knew for sure if there would even be a fall season at all.
 “They worked their butts off this summer, and they’re going in the right direction,” Doherty said. “I’ve been impressed with their conditioning and the work they’ve put in, they show up every day and they want to work hard.”
 Settling in as a first-year head coach would be a challenge any year, but Doherty faces the added difficulty posed by the pandemic. This fall field hockey will be played with extensive safety modifications, the most notable being that games will be played seven-on-seven instead of the usual 11-on-11. Coupled with the elimination of penalty corners and the wearing of masks during play, the Indians will have to adjust to a whole new game on the fly.
 “It is a challenge, it’s going to take flexibility, some people will be put in different spots, because it’s not a 11 v. 11 game anymore,” Doherty said. “So I’ve been trying different things in practice in terms of different formats each day, working on different lines, different shifts with playing time, but it’s going to come down to passing, communication, ball movement and fitness.”
 Amesbury opens its season at Georgetown on Friday at 3:45 p.m.

 The two, though, don’t know each other. They meet on the train, and she doesn’t reveal her true identity. Anyone who has watched mainstream entertainers would know that the two will inevitably fall in love, after a spate of incidents that intentionally and unintentionally evoke laughter.
 The families are at loggerheads. Posani Krishna Murali as Bujji’s father is at the receiving end of the wrath of Krishnaveni’s mother (Vani Vishwanath). Bujji has to trace Krishnaveni and prove that he has nothing to do with her running away from home, to save his dad’s fortunes. And Krishnaveni has to find Bujji to prove her side of the story.
 The initial hour or so is packed with laugh-aloud moments. There’s nothing too striking, but it’s not bad either. Sid Sriram is also called in to add his charming touch to the blossoming romance through the song ‘Ee May Peremito’ (composed by Anup Rubens).
 However, the later portions become a drag. The hospital scene involving Sapthagiri and Raj Tarun begins on a fun note but goes on and on until you feel like giving up with the rest of the film.
 Apart from a few comic segments that overstay their welcome, the lack of depth to some of the characters makes the film disappointing. On paper, Vani Vishwanath’s character might have appeared like a complex woman of power, but it doesn’t translate well on screen.
 Raj Tarun portrays an effervescent youngster as usual and Malvika gets ample scope to show that she can also be good in fun parts. The portions that show her as a pragmatic young woman who knows to guard herself on social media deserve a mention. Hebah Patel is effortless in her brief appearance as an opportunist.
 At 149 minutes, _Orey Bujjiga_ is way too long for an old predictable tale full of gags.

 If there was any confusion about his attitude as a youngster, those are quashed as he recalls, when aged 16, he went head-to-head with Arsenal main man Thierry Henry.

 Ibrox would have been rocking for Galatasaray last night. Instead it was empty.
 But if the punters had been in, they would have been bouncing early on as their side carved out several decent chances.
 Alfredo Morelos has plenty on his plate, from chasing Ally McCoist’s European goal record to going up against his big hero Radamel Falcao.
 But the Gers striker also nearly got an opportunity on a plate after 70 seconds when Hagi nudged the ball in behind and the Colombian ace was a whisker away from beating keeper Fatih Ozturk to pinch an opener.
 It was an early confidence boost for the Ibrox side.
 Conor Goldson’s header was deflected over the top, Morelos headed across goal when Tavernier was steaming in at the back post to bury and there was a big handball shout as well in amidst the opening flurry.

Never, never, judge, never give me even advice, just ask questions that then allowed me to think, OK, I see what's going on here.
 And so that I have definitely lost and he has definitely lost. But, every once in a while I can still come in with a question and he'll just go deep analytic and be right in there for the length of that question. So in some ways, it's taught me new ways to think and talk and interact with him.
