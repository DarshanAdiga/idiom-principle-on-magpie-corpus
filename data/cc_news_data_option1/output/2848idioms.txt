Raymond Arnold lived to see the day.
   
 He never thought he would.
   
 Arnold, a Spartanburg resident, was on the pit crew and became chief mechanic for Wendell Scott, one of NASCAR's first black drivers, a Hall of Famer, and still the only African-American to ever win race at the circuit's highest level. Arnold sat in his bed, less than a month before his passing, and held a model car in his hands. It was the No. 43 famously associated with Richard Petty, now driven by Bubba Wallace, the only black driver in the series, and it was autographed by both.
   
 That day, June 10, two days after Wallace pleaded a case that had been made upon deaf ears for decades, NASCAR banned the Confederate flag from its events.
   
 "He was in disbelief," said his daughter, Toni Arnold-McFarland. "He said, 'I don't really know it is really going to happen.' I gave him that car sent to him by a racing enthusiast and my dad just kind of looked at it and held on to it. You could tell he was going back through his life and was thinking about how things could've been so different if this moment had happened 50 years before."
   
 Arnold died on July 7. A memorial service was held 10 days later, Friday evening, at the most appropriate place, the Piedmont Interstate Fairgrounds, more commonly known as the Spartanburg County Fairgrounds, near downtown. You would never know it by looking at it today, except for the remaining barriers around overgrown weeds, but this was the center of the NASCAR world in 1961, when Arnold went to watch this black driver he had heard so much about from his friend David Pearson, who became arguably - up against Petty and later Dale Earnhardt - the greatest driver in the history of their sport.
   
 And on that day, Scott's NASCAR Grand National debut on March 4 of 1961, Arnold was troubled by the fact that Scott didn't have enough help in the pits or in the garage. So Arnold actually came out of the stands to offer help. Arnold ended up taking the carburetor off his own automobile to put in the race car. From that day on, Scott and Arnold stayed as close as close can be. Arnold became a trusted source both on and off the track.
   
 Consider that this was during the height of the Civil Rights unrest. It was less than six months from when 6-year-old Ruby Bridges had to be escorted by four armed federal marshals to become the first student to integrate an elementary school in New Orleans. Throughout 1961, there were the "Freedom Rides" throughout the South, and they were marked by violence. Civil rights leader and U.S. representative John Lewis, who died Friday, was one of the 13 original Freedom Riders recruited by and often stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Martin Luther King Jr.
   
 "The Confederate flag is actually heritage to a lot of people," said Scott's son, Frankie, a gifted mechanic in his own right who witnessed discrimination first-hand from a young age. "And a lot of that is not bad. But when you come to a race track, it's something you should not have to deal with. On your own property, that's fine. On your own vehicle, that's fine. But when people come to a race track, there is a lot of bad history associated with that flag.
   
 "We are hoping that society will realize that it's time for a change. I think it's going to help NASCAR in the long run. You don't want to come to the track and hear derogatory terms when you have paid your money to come. You just want to enjoy good racing. It's a good thing and it's long overdue. … NASCAR seems to realize that now is finally the time."
   
 "This should have happened sooner," said Arnold-McFarland. "We should be further along. We want this to be a learning time. It's time for us to move forward. We need more diversity in the sport."
   
 Perry Allen Wood was 9 years old and at the Spartanburg track when Arnold helped Scott make his Grand National debut. Wood is now a NASCAR historian, noted author and co-host of a weekly radio show on 1400 AM Spartanburg called "Start Your Engines."
   
 "From what I gather," Wood said, "Arnold was a well-known person around the local shops. Pearson would have had to have known Wendell through short-track races. So it's interesting that he introduced to the two if that is the case."
   
 Scott's car lasted only 52 laps in that first race and the carburetor went back in Arnold's car so he could get home. The top three, in order, were Spartanburg's Cotton Owens, Petty and Pearson. Ned Jarrett's car had oil pressure failure, same thing that got Scott, and was 16th, one spot and two laps ahead of Scott.
   
 Scott never had a sponsor or a manufacturer backing his team. He took broken car parts discarded from other drivers and searched junk yards. Arnold was instrumental, through his connections, in helping Scott find pieces to put together a car to race. Their goal was not necessarily to win but to finish, hopefully in the top 10, to get paid and continue racing.
   
 In nearly 500 races over his 13-year career, Scott had a top-10 finish 147 times and won the Jacksonville (Fla.) 200 in 1964 by passing Petty near the end. With a strong backing and an even playing field, who knows how good Scott could have been.
   
 "I'm not going to tell you he would've been a track champion," Wood said. "But he might have been."
   
 Interestingly enough, Arnold missed that only victory. He was a teacher, most recently until his retirement at Eastside High School in Taylors, and could only get to the races closer to the upstate.

The typical rule of thumb given by financial planners is to have a goal of saving up to 20% of total earnings. But if you want to retire when you're younger, that percentage will probably need to be more like 40% to 50% of your income. Of course, that's not so simple since a big part of your paycheck goes to day-to-day, necessary expenses. So if you want to save that much, you need to make some serious lifestyle adjustments. It requires making changes, but it's doable.

The New York Democrat is reviving his strategy from the last virus aid bill that forced Republicans to the negotiating table after McConnell's original bill was opposed by Democrats.
 Schumer said Trump's effort to block testing funds in "unacceptable."
 Trump raised alarms on Capitol Hill when he suggested last month at a rally in Oklahoma that he wanted to slow virus testing. Some of Trump's GOP allies wanted new money to help test and track the virus to contain its spread. Senate Democrats were investigating why the Trump administration had not yet spent some of $25 billion previously allocated for testing in an earlier aid bill.
 The payroll tax Trump wanted also divided his party. Senate Republicans in particular opposed the payroll tax break as an insufficient response to millions of out-of-work Americans, especially as they tried to keep the total price tag of the aid package at no more than $1 trillion.
 Trump said Sunday in the Fox News interview that he would consider not signing any bill unless it included the payroll tax break, which many GOP senators opposed.
 "I want to see it," he said.
 As McConnell prepared to roll out his $1 trillion-plus proposal, he acknowledged it would not have full support. This would be the fifth virus aid package, after the $2.2 trillion bill passed in March, the largest U.S. intervention of its kind.
 The first round of virus aid is running out.
 A federal $600-a-week boost to regular unemployment benefits would expire at the end of the month. So, too, would the federal ban on evictions on millions of rental units.
 With 17 straight weeks of unemployment claims topping 1 million — usually about 200,000 — many households were facing a cash crunch and losing employer- backed health insurance coverage.
 Despite flickers of an economic upswing as states eased stay-at-home orders in May and June, the jobless rate remained at double digits, higher than it ever was in the last decade's Great Recession.
 Pelosi's bill, approved in May, included $75 billion for testing and tracing to try to get a handle on the virus spread, funneled $100 billion to schools to safely reopen and called for $1 trillion to be sent to cash-strapped states to pay essential workers and prevent layoffs. The measure would give cash stipends to Americans, and bolster rental and mortgage and other safety net protections.
 In the two months since Pelosi's bill passed, the U.S. had 50,000 more deaths and 2 million more infections.
 "If we don't invest the money now, it will be much worse," Pelosi said.

Mourinho has named an unchanged side during the games and it has seen the team get the better of Arsenal, Newcastle United and Leicester City.
 Tottenham's attacking quartet of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Giovani Lo Celso have proved crucial over the past week and they were on song against the Foxes on Sunday, with all four playing a huge role in the second goal of the afternoon.
 The Lilywhites are now seeing exactly what Lo Celso can do in the final third in a more advanced role after playing the vast majority of the season slightly deeper alongside one of Harry Winks or Moussa Sissoko.
 The Argentine can have a big impact on the game in his position further forward and Mourinho may want to stick with him there over the foreseeable future.

Pelosi said any attempt by the White House to block testing money "goes beyond ignorance."
 Lawmakers were returning to a Capitol still off-limits to tourists, another sign of the nation's difficulty containing the coronavirus. Rather than easing, the pandemic's devastating cycle was happening all over again, leaving Congress little choice but to engineer another costly rescue. Businesses were shutting down again, schools could not fully reopen and jobs were disappearing, all while federal aid expired.
 Without a successful federal strategy, lawmakers are trying to draft one.
 Trump insisted again Sunday that the virus would "disappear," but the president's view did not at all match projections from the leading health professionals straining to halt the alarming U.S. caseload and death toll.
 "It's not going to magically disappear," said a somber McConnell, R-Ky., last week during a visit to a hospital in his home state to thank front-line workers.
 McConnell and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy were set to meet with Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin "to fine-tune" the legislation, acting chief of staff Mark Meadows said on Fox News.
 The political stakes were high for all sides before the November election, but even more so for the nation, which now registered more coronavirus infections and a higher death count of 140,500 than any other country.
 The House already approved Pelosi's sweeping $3 trillion effort, giving Democrats momentum heading into negotiations.
 The package from McConnell had been quietly crafted behind closed doors for weeks and was expected to include $75 billion to help schools reopen, reduced unemployment benefits alongside a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans, and a sweeping five-year liability shield against coronavirus lawsuits.
 But as the White House weighed in, it has put the administration at odds with GOP allies in Congress. The administration was panning some $25 billion in proposed new funds for testing and tracing, said one Republican familiar with the discussions. Trump was also reviving his push for a payroll tax break, which was being seriously considered, said another Republican. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks.
 Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned Monday his side will block any effort from McConnell that falls short.
 "We will stand together again if we must," Schumer said in a letter to colleagues.

Arguably though, encouraging the public to eat out doesn’t sound like the right way to go about the problem. When eating out, we are statistically more likely to overeat due to bigger portions while sodium and cholesterol levels are significantly higher, and we’re likely to fall into the temptation of desserts.

Engineers have completed a temporary repair of the Toddbrook Reservoir dam almost a year after it partially collapsed and threatened to inundate Whaley Bridge.
 More than 1,500 people were evacuated from the picturesque Derbyshire town when the spillway began crumbling during heavy rainfall in early August last year.
 A huge emergency operation involving the RAF and hundreds of firefighters and police officers saw the damaged wall shored up with hundreds of tonnes of aggregate while the reservoir was hastily drained.
 Professor David Balmforth, a reviewer of reservoir safety, blamed 'poor design' and 'intermittent maintenance over the years' for the failure of the dam in his report about the breach in March.
 Today (Monday) engineers revealed the temporary repair of the damaged spillway has now been completed.
 The dam’s waterproof clay core has been made more effective by the installation of a concrete ‘cut off beam’ and an enhanced crest wall along the top of the dam to protect against extreme downpours.

Pelosi's bill, approved in May, included $75 billion for testing and tracing to try to get a handle on the virus spread, funneled $100 billion to schools to safely reopen and called for $1 trillion to be sent to cash-strapped states to pay essential workers and prevent layoffs. The measure would give cash stipends to Americans, and bolster rental and mortgage and other safety net protections.

As far as determining how to invest in 5G stocks, there are some different things to consider. First of all, 5G is a communications technology. As smartphones with 5G hit the market, they will need a much higher degree of internet connectivity through cellular networks. Naturally, these communications companies will be able to charge higher fees per smartphone, as they will offer more and better services. The Internet of Things involving all things connected to the internet like autonomous cars, smart cities, health monitoring services, and a wide range of other things will ring the register as well. And many of these telecom companies can lock in customers for long- term contracts.

 The publication reported that the north London club could make a move in the summer but have been warned that they will have to pay a significant sum.
 Although Gabriel cost the Ligue 1 side just £1.5million, it is claimed that Lille President Gerard Lopez is expected to hold out for a fee of around £30m, based on the £27m Arsenal spent on Saint Etienne defender William Saliba last summer.

“It would be less of a problem in terms of fairness, because this time around we’ve had two parts to the season: normal and not normal,” Ferré said. “Imagine that in 2021 all matches are played behind closed doors (without fans) and with five subs. We would adapt, because it would be comparable.”
