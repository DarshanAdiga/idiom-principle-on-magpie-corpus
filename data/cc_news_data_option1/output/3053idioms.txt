An underground gas pipeline at Assam's Geleky oilfield of energy major Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) ruptured on Monday, leading to leakage of gas in the entire area, a senior company official said.&amp;nbsp;However, it immediately stopped supply of gas through the damaged pipeline and started repair work, which is likely to be competed by tonight, ONGC Executive Director (Assam Asset) Sanjeev Kakran told PTI.&quot;At around 12:30 pm, a leakage occurred in an underground four-inch pipeline inside ONGC's gas compressor plant at the Geleki field. It was followed by a small blast and the gas came out,&quot; he said.&amp;nbsp;Kakran, however, claimed the leakage did not catch fire and there is no injury of any kind to anybody as well as no safety hazard to the sorrounding environment or people living nearby.&quot;The gas pipeline was immediately depressurised and isolated. ONGC's team is on the site to repair the pipeline, which should be completed by tonight itself,&quot; the official added. He also said ONGC is investing Rs 265 crore to replace all the pipelines of Geleki operations and 70 per cent of the work is already over.&quot;This is one of our very old oil fields. We undertook replacement of entire pipeline network here, comprising crude, gas and water injection lines. The work is likely to be completed by May 2021. We plan to invest more money to upgrade our operations,&quot; Kakran said.A gas well of another PSU major Oil India at Baghjan in Tinsukia district of Assam has been spewing gas uncontrollably for the last 69 days since May 27, and it caught fire on June 9, killing two firefighters at the site.

"articleBody": "England know another sluggish start to a Test campaign could prove costly as they go in search of a first series win over Pakistan in a decade. Wednesday sees a three-match contest get underway with the first Test at Old Trafford. And while England can point to recent series victories over most of their rivals, their last such success against Pakistan was back in 2010. That campaign, however, was overshadowed by a 'spot-fixing' scandal at Lord's which led to bans and jail terms for then Pakistan captain Salman Butt as well as pacemen Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir.

"The lockdown restrictions have been lifted by the central government!" I informed my partner in a matter-of-factly way. He kept looking at his phone without blinking and after a long gap of 20 seconds, reminded me that the state government may wish to keep us confined to our homes for longer.I groaned in response. The lockdown fatigue had started taking roots in my life and I was running out of ways to keep myself entertained. Making jars of Dalgona coffees, loaves of banana bread, watching all the new shows and movies on streaming platforms, and chattering on video calls with friends and family evoked as much excitement in me as my boss telling me that I may have to work on weekends.While I was doing a mental marathon on the hamster wheel of boredom and frustration, my partner started shrieking with happiness. I asked him sarcastically, "Which jackpot have you won?" I realized the joke was on me when he replied, "I just won a big poker tournament on Adda52!" I grabbed his phone and to my surprise, he had indeed won real cash. I knew then how I was going to entertain myself for the rest of the days in home confinement.Share the fun with your friends and family on private tablesMy tryst with online poker on Adda52 was a revelation of sorts. Before I started playing on Adda52, my participation in poker games was limited to social settings, and the customary poker parties during Diwali.I had a penchant for the game and my skills had also developed significantly in the last few years. Contrary to popular belief, poker is highly skill-based and tests your emotional control, analytical and strategy-making abilities. However, I could never muster the confidence to play poker online. Given that a physical game allows players to change strategies based on their observations about other players, the thought of playing poker without being able to observe other players seemed challenging. There were misgivings about the safety and the fairness of the game on online platforms.All those fears evaporated with Adda52 thanks to the private table feature. It is thrilling to have an online poker party with my closest friends and family members thanks to the private tables, and the fun quotient of that experience is incomparably higher than that of any online game. Private tables are a great attraction for people like me who are new to the world of online poker and are not too keen on playing the game with random people or against a computer.A chance to win real cashMy partner's victory dance after winning the poker tournament was enough to convince me that there is real money to be won on the platform, unlike any other online game. Be it high rollers or amateur players, there is something for everyone as Adda52 has a plethora of table options. What's more, there are daily freeroll or cash tournaments with huge prize pools worth lakhs, handsome bonuses, and even exciting deposit schemes. The adrenaline rush that I felt after winning a few matches against some excellent poker players was enough to make me forget my yearnings for outdoor activities. Celebrities like Minissha Lamba and Rannvijay Singha are also beating the lockdown blues by playing poker on Adda52. The software is compatible with Windows and Macintosh and the app can be downloaded on Android or iOS devices.Safety and fairnessSince online poker in India is a relatively novel concept, I had my fair share of inhibitions about the possibility of the games being rigged. Besides the allure of being able to win a jackpot, what drew me to Adda52 was that the platform has been certified by iTech Labs for fair gameplay, which is a global standard in gaming software reliability. Adda52 also ranks high in terms of the safety quotient. The platform uses 128-bit encryption to ensure a completely safe environment for players and also has the VeriSign Norton SSL certification. The payment gateway is fully secure with multiple options for deposits.I have also managed to get my friends hooked to Adda52 thanks to their sign-up bonus offer. Every new user gets Rs 500 as a bonus on signing up and existing users can win cash benefits and referral benefits through Adda52's unique referral programme.I have found my 'adda' thanks to 'Adda52'. I know you want this, too! Chalo phir ab sab poker khelenge!

When you add the fact that each technology has its own user interface (UI) and management console, it can very quickly become overwhelming for the end user to keep tabs on each console, learn every interface and complicates building a workflow in the case of incidents or investigations. The administrators who manage the system also have to update each component individually, ensure that the integrations don't break when an update is delivered and ensure that any new technologies don't cause an existing piece of your solution to fail.

England have lost the first Test in eight of their last 10 series -- including during last month's 2-1 win over the West Indies that marked international cricket's return from the coronavirus lockdown.It is a statistic they are all well aware of, with in-form England pacemen Chris Woakes admitting: "I'd love to be able to put my finger on it and I'm sure the management and the team would as well."It's not coincidence but it's almost, it is just a coincidence that we can keep losing that first Test match."But we want to put that right," he added, with the eyes of the global cricket community set to turn to Manchester in the absence of any other major international fixtures outside of England amid the pandemic.Both of Pakistan's past two series in England -- 2016 and 2018 -- ended in draws, which should encourage the tourists this time even though they go into the first Test on the back of just a couple of intra- squad warm-up fixtures compared to their 'match-hardened' hosts.'Complete bowler'"We've had good preparations and team bonding," said Pakistan coach Misbah-ul-Haq on Monday."Still we feel there is always a slight nervousness when you just play Test cricket after a long, long time (away)," he added ahead of his side's first Test in six months.Misbah accepted that how his batsmen coped with James Anderson and Stuart Broad -- who now both have more than 500 Test wickets each after Broad reached the landmark against the West Indies -- would go a long way to determining the outcome of the series.But the former Pakistan captain was also excited by a pace attack that includes the youthful promise of teenage rising star Naseem Shah as well as the accurate Mohammad Abbas,and towering left-armer Shaheen Shah Afridi.Naseem has impressed Pakistan fast-bowling great turned bowling Waqar Younis and Misbah so much when they saw him in action in Lahore, the coach said they had no qualms about fast-tracking a "complete bowler" into Pakistan's side in Australia last year.Naseem became the youngest bowler to take a Test hat-trick against Bangladesh in February and he showed a liking for English conditions with 10 wickets in the two practice matches at Derby."He is one who could win a Test match on his own," said Misbah of Naseem.Pakistan, however, could still deploy two spinners at Old Trafford in Yasir Shah and Shadab Khan.The West Indies failed to post a single individual century in their recent series. Pakistan will hope the likes of Abid Ali, the first man to score a hundred on both Test and one-day international debut, Shan Masood, Azhar Ali, Babar Asam and Asad Shafiq can provide the runs they need.Meanwhile England must decide whether to stick with four quicks in their XI after Ben Stokes couldn't bowl in the West Indies decider because of a quad injury.The star all-rounder was, however, reported to have bowled with good pace in the nets on Monday.",

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - As teachers are headed back to the classroom Monday in Muscogee County, many parents still have questions about how the “back to school” process will work. Takesha Lynn, an eighth grade Language Arts teacher at Aaron Cohn Middle School, is excited to be back in the classroom preparing for the upcoming school year.“This literally has been the day to hit the ground running. And I say that because it will basically be full-steam ahead in preparing for something we’ve never been apart of, and that’s a pandemic,” Lynn said.Between now and the first day of school for students in the Muscogee County School District August 17, teachers will have virtual learning training. All students will learn virtually for the first half of the nine weeks and then the district will reassess.Once school starts, Lynn said each teachers will have 30 minutes of social, emotional, and individual learning time a day. She explained how her daily schedule will look with live virtual teaching following Aaron Cohn’s block scheduling.“Within that time frame, we have an outline set up to Zoom with our students and then have individual time for them to complete any assignments within that almost two-hour increment of time,” Lynn said.Lynn wants to make sure students are ready to learn.“We cannot just put a pause symbol on their education because they still have to advance. They can’t stay in the sixth grade or the seventh grade forever. They have to move on one day, so we have to be in place and we have to make sure that they are ready to go forward,” Lynn explained.As far as what teaching will look like once in-person learning is an option, Lynn said that’s still in the works.“We all have questions about that. We’re definitely concerned about that because just like everyone, we want to be safe and in good health and we want our students definitely safe and in good health,” she said.The biggest challenge for Lynn right now is the technology that comes along with virtual learning. She hopes parents and students are patient as they learn the ins and outs of this new format of learning.Copyright 2020 WTVM. All rights reserved.

During the first quarter of this consolidated fiscal year (April 1 to June 30, 2020), a rapid deceleration in the global economy was seen from restrictions on economic activity to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The increase in people infected with the virus led to restrictions on overseas travel and stay-at-home restrictions in the U.S. and Europe from March onward, and economic activity stagnated as steps were taken to close stores and other businesses, leading to an even greater deceleration in the economy. In China, economic conditions remained severe despite the resumption of economic activity and consequent signs of recovery, owing to the impact of stagnant overseas demand, restrictions on economic activities, and other factors. The declaration of a State of Emergency by the Japanese government in light of the spread of the virus caused further slowing of consumer spending and corporate revenues, making the future of the Japanese economy uncertain.

The existence of cars in the game has been one of the worst kept secrets surrounding _Fortnite_. Fans got a glimpse at the vehicles in the aforementioned trailer, but leakers have been discussing the addition over the last few weeks. Previous rumors pointed towards a July 21st release date, but it seems that Epic Games may have pushed the release back.
 Those previous leaks also indicated that the cars will have a spawn rate with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 10 per lobby, with different cars having different tank capacities and health points. A Chrome Race limited time event will apparently arrive alongside this week's update. During the event, players will have to race to the finish line using any means necessary. While the August 5th release date is official, fans should bear in mind that the rest of this information has not been confirmed, as of this writing.
 It will be interesting to see what kind of impact cars have on the game! The addition of choppas earlier this year had a pretty significant impact on player strategies, and it seems that cars could have an even bigger impact. Fans have been waiting for quite some time to see cars added to the game, so it seems many will be eager to give them a spin later this week.

I mean, there's some amazingly talented people in all those categories and to be in the middle of a bunch of guys or girls that are on the top of their game, is an awesome experience for an artist. It's just an awesome experience that kind of collaboration, or to even have a boss that just got it going on, or to be with a fellow actress or actor, that's just inspiring every take after take, after take that you do. It's just so much, but every once in a while, somebody in my business will say something or do something and I wish I wasn't in a business then, but no, as far as regrets, it's pretty simple really. I'm not sure what, I think it's very common, this answer. I'm not sure what I would do if I wasn't an actor, I'd probably be a teacher.

It is worth noting that Millions of dollars have been collected by the Government of Eritrea (GOE), from its supporters in diaspora; nothing has been seen on the ground, to indicate use of these funds. I therefore call upon the UN and the International community, to use their good offices, to consider and expedite Emergency food and other support, for the needy population of Eritrea, inside the country and in the camps in neighbouring countries as well as in Libya. I thank you. Yohannes T. Berhe"

The Queens Theater in New York, I teach there, I teach disabled actors there and it's kind of everything's at a standstill right now because of the whole COVID situation. But once we're in the clear we'll go back to doing that, it's a program called The Theater For All, and they need donations. And so if anybody is in New York and wants to donate to them, you can get online and do that. And yeah, right now, those are my two things.

I think that I got into magic, and I used to do, I started doing shows and I got to be a very popular magician down in Florida, a really young one, but very popular and I used to make a lot of money as a young man. And so I realized that I had no butterflies on stage and I could actually focus on stage and not be distracted by the audience or any kind of judgment of me or anything like that. And then as I got older, I realized that, if I want it to get the girls maybe magic isn't the right way to go and I had never studied any instruments or anything, so I thought acting was the next jump. And I just realized that I had to learn how, because I'd seen some people act when I was being a techie. And I'm like, "They're not very good, "they're not very good actors, "yet they're up there and I give them credit for it." But I thought, I don't wanna be like that. I wanna, if I'm gonna do it, I wanna be as good as I was doing magic. So I studied, I went and I studied in New York City and studied and studied and studied and studied and like six years later, I got my first professional job in a theater.

I play Reverend Jerry Falwell in that, and so that's already in the can when that's coming out. I don't know yet. Everything is kind of weird right now 'cause of what we're going through. So that was the last one I was able to get into the can it wasn't that long ago.

If you ask any customer what the biggest negative is when it comes to new and emerging technologies, you'll get a pretty rapid answer of "vendor lock-in." You can have the best technology in the world, but if you don't give a customer the opportunity to build multiple, "best-of-breed" products into a comprehensive strategy, you're going to fall by the wayside pretty quickly.
