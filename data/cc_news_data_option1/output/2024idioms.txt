Jammu and Kashimir observed a subdued and low-key celebrations on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitr on Sunday because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown rules in place.
 All major shrines and mosques, including the Jamia Masjid, the Hazratbal shrine, Eidgah in Srinagar and the Talab Khatikaan Jamia Masjid in Jammu, decided against organising any, otherwise mandatory, mass congregational prayers that sees the culmination of the holy month of fasting, Ramzan, for Muslims.
 Most people organised at-home prayers where only closed families members joined in. Scores of people posted pictures on the social media of family organising own prayers, because the priests and caretakers of mosques had passed decree to maintain social distancing and avoiding mass prayers on the occasion.
 “We offered Id prayers at home with my father leading the prayers,” Peerzada Mahboob Ul Haq, a local, said.
 Kashmir’s grand priest Nasir-ul-Islam had appealed to people living in the red zones and hotspots to organise prayers at home and those living in green zones to perform Id prayers in playgrounds, “while wearing face masks and maintaining proper social distancing”.
 “May this Id be the harbinger of peace and prosperity for the entire J&K and may Allah bring an end to the Covid pandemic soon,” said Mr. Islam, who sighted the crescent moon on late Saturday evening and declared Id for Sunday.
 ## Deserted look
 Unlike in the past when streets would be abuzz with children wearing new clothes, the Valley wore a deserted look.
 “We are organising video meetings with relatives to exchange greetings this time. We may have to give up on Eidee (gift given by elders to children) due to the coronavirus pandemic,” said Nazia Jan, a Class X student from Srinagar’s Gojwara area.
 Meanwhile, extra deployments and additional checkpoints were set up by the security forces across the Valley on the occasion.

The main event of the 2018 _Crown Jewel_ pay-per-view is infamous for being one of the worst WWE matches of that year. Between Triple H suffering a torn pectoral early in the match, Shawn Michaels looking rusty after being retired for several years and all four men looking to be past their prime, the 27-minute tag team match between D-Generation X and The Brothers of Destruction was panned by fans before even mentioning the politics surrounding the Saudi Arabia event.
 In the latest episode of _Undertaker: The Last Ride_, Taker, Michaels and Hunter all blasted the match for not turning out like they hoped.
 "It's with Kane and Taker, dude it's a night off, right," Triple H said while describing how he pitched the match to Michaels. "You'll come in there, we'll do a couple of crotch chops, we'll throw some glow sticks out, a couple of Superkicks, drop an elbow, it'll all be great. No problems, easy... except me and Taker are doing the 'once in a while' thing, Shawn hasn't wrestled in however many years, Kane's the mayor. It was like a bad comedy movie, it really is."
 Hunter played back the moment when he suffered his injury and jokingly imitated how Michaels said, "you're kidding me" when he learned his tag partner was hurt. They then showed the clip of Kane's mask flying off after Michaels hit him with a few punches.
 "It couldn't have gone any worse," Triple H said.
 "It was a total train wreck, it was a disaster," Undertaker said.
 "Whoa, goodness. It totally blew," Michaels said.
 Undertaker said he took responsibility for what happened because mentally he wasn't into the match due to personal issues going on in his family. However, he mentioned that the match could've potentially been his last.
 "If that match would've came off the way it was intended, the way we wanted it to, that may have been enough for me," Taker said.

 Earlier in the episode Undertaker admitted that he was jealous of how Michaels was able to retire back at _WrestleMania XXVI_.
 "I'm so envious of Shawn because he was able to walk away and be...he was good with it. Do I wish I had that kind of clarity? Absolutely," Undertaker said. "He had the clarity before going into the match. Hopefully, when I have the match I'm looking for, I have that clarity. 'Okay, that's it.'"

The decision to let Liverpool's Champions League match against Atletico Madrid go-ahead may have "led to 41 additional deaths" due to the coronavirus, the Sunday Times reported. Jurgen Klopp's side faced the Spanish club in a second- leg last 16 tie at Anfield on March 11 in front of a crowd of some 52,000, with 3,000 visiting supporters in attendance. The match was the last major football fixture played in England before the coronavirus lockdown.
 According to the Sunday Times, Edge Health, which analyses data for Britain's National Health Service, estimated the match was "linked to 41 additional deaths" at nearby hospitals between 25 and 35 days later, compared with similar hospital trusts that were used as a control.
 Imperial College London and Oxford University have estimated Spain had around 640,000 positive coronavirus cases at the time that the match went ahead compared to 100,000 in Britain at that stage.
 March also saw jump horse racing's four-day Cheltenham Festival in southwest England go ahead as scheduled, with officials citing British government guidance that it was safe to proceed with major sporting events.
 According to the Edge Health research estimates cited by the Sunday Times, that decision may have been linked to 37 additional deaths.
 More than 250,000 people attended Cheltenham, with organisers insisting they had introduced special hygiene measures for the event, including extra hand- washing stations for spectators.
 But racing in Britain was suspended on March 17 in response to the pandemic after the British Horseracing Authority was widely criticised for allowing the festival to go ahead.
 Last month one of the mayors for Liverpool called for an investigation into why the Atletico match was allowed to proceed as scheduled.
 "If people have contracted coronavirus as a direct result of a sporting event that we believe shouldn't have taken place, well that is scandalous," Steve Rotheram, Mayor of Liverpool City Region, told the BBC.
 "That needs to be investigated to find out whether some of those infections are due directly to the Atletico fans. There were coronavirus hot cities, and Madrid was one of those."
 Atletico won the game 3-2 after extra-time to knock out the defending champions 4-2 on aggregate and reach the quarter-finals.
 An initial ban on spectators is expected when sport resumes in Britain, which has already seen more than 36,000 deaths during the pandemic -- the worst tally in Europe and second only to the United States.

 Accusing the TTD board of “bending over backwards” to please the political bosses, he told the members not to incur the wrath of Lord Venkateswara through such decisions.

 Objecting to the move, Congress State general secretary D. Rambhupal Reddy said the TTD should, instead, hand over the Lord’s properties to the devout, who would go the extra mile to safeguard them.
 Selling the landed properties in other States, which were donated with a noble intention, would only amount to hurting the sentiments of the donors, he fumed.
 Since the TTD had local committees in every State, the board should leave the maintenance of such properties to the local devotees, who would be more than willing to do the same, Mr. Reddy observed.
 Jana Sena Party district leader and Tirupati constituency in-charge K. Kiran Rayal said the TTD should stop any move that could hurt the feelings of the devout.

Viewers have been binging since Thanksgiving Day on _Suits_ , and USA Network is hoping they'll   still be hungry when the second half of the series second season starts Jan.   17.
 Working with nearly all of its distribution partners, USA   arranged to have all 22 already-aired episodes of _Suits_ available for free on video on demand. They've also been   available for streaming at USAnetwork.com and on Hulu.
 The object of enabling such a binge-a-thon is to give viewers   a second chance to get hooked on the serialized lawyer drama from the beginning   and, as of last week, more than six million episodes have been viewed.
 "In terms of sheer sampling, this has been a runaway success   for us," says Alexandra Shapiro, executive VP for marketing at USA. "That's a   massive number. Let's just say we convert 20% of those people now to come back   and watch us [when new episodes resume.] That would be for us a huge success."
 She adds that USA's strategy appears to be working because   viewers seem to be watching older episodes first, with 57% of the content   consumed coming from season one and the remaining 43% coming from season two.   About 62% of the viewing was via VOD, with 38% coming via streaming.
  _Suits_ has been one   of USA's most watched series already, averaging nearly six million total   viewers during 2012, ranking it sixth among original cable series.
 Shapiro says that when it comes to marketing TV, letting   people see for themselves how good a show is beats telling them. And making   previously aired episodes available has given a big boost to series such as _Mad Men_ , _Downton Abbey_ and _Breaking   Bad_, she says. "Enabling binge watching for all three of those franchises is   the difference between OK ratings and stratospheric ratings," she said.
 Because _Suits_   already generates high ratings, she wouldn't predict that the binge-a-thon   would have a similar effect. But she said her goal was to strengthen the _Suits_ franchise over the long term and   that the network decided to do this now, while the series was young, rather   than wait till later in the show's life.
 For _Mad Men_ and _Breaking Bad_ , the boost came when past   episodes were made available via Netflix, which pays a shows owner big fees to   stream the shows. But Shapiro says that this holiday season stunt won't prevent    _Suits_ from someday being bought by   subscription VOD steamers like Netflix and Amazon.
 USA's move is especially suited for a breed of viewer that   prefers to watch shows -- particularly serialized dramas in a marathon fashion.
 "There are people who literally this is the only way they   watch. And we can't ignore it. They want to binge watch," Shapiro. "This is   probably the only tactic you have to reach them." Shapiro says that on an   anecdotal basis, holiday periods, such as Thanksgiving weekend and the stretch   between Christmas and New Year's Day, are some of the biggest binge-watching   period. That's when people have time to catch up with series that they've   either let lapse or have simply never sampled, she said.
 Many viewers are reluctant to jump into a serialized series   in the middle, no matter how good it sounds. "By availing all 22 episodes to   date we in essence took away that being a factor or a deterrent for people to   sample the show," Shapiro says.
 The episodes will stop being available after the first new   episode airs on Jan. 18. "This has had a long run, and at that point you really   want to drive viewers back to the mother ship," she says.
 The stunt became the centerpiece of USA's midseason marketing   for _Suits_. "It gave us an anchor   around which to focus all of our messaging," she said. "We had paid media in   the marketplace to drive to this. It was primarily as digital effort and all of   our social efforts brought this marathon to life by using the dialog and   imagery from the episodes."
 The push also got crucial support from cable operators and   other distributors that was very targeted.   "You really can't go and buy that off the shelf. You have to create these compelling offerings   to get that kind of support from these MSOs," Shapiro says.
 USA had this binge idea too late to draw sponsors for the   event. But the viewership it's generating should make it attractive to   advertisers in the future.
 "These are the things that advertisers should absolutely   hitch their cart to. It makes total sense," Shapiro says. "I think the only   barrier to entry in aligning advertisers in the VOD space has been the lack of   dynamic ad insertion. As you know in 2013 that's going to be a moot point.   Every cable operator will have dynamic ad insertion and so when these amazing   opportunities happen, I think the smart advertisers will recognize their value   and want to align themselves."

A pervert dad who was found in bed with a teenage girl in care he had been secretly messaging on Snapchat was blasted by a judge for seeking to 'condone' the abuse of vulnerable kids.
 Billy Hibbert, 22, has been accused of ruining the young girl's life after she developed strong feelings for him and repeatedly ran away from home to stay with him.
 He was twice seen on CCTV kissing her.
 Hibbert has now been jailed by a judge who said he had 'exploited' the vulnerable 14 year-old 'for a sexual purpose' and had sought to justify it by saying she was a "looked after child."
 Hibbert, of no fixed address, was charged and pleaded guilty to two counts of child abduction and one count of sexual activity with a child and was sentenced by a judge sitting at Minshull Street Crown.
 Judge Tina Landale said he had showed "no remorse" as she sentenced him to 21 months behind bars.
 She also made a restraining order banning him from contacting her and a sexual harm prevention order, both lasting for 10 years.

NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump visited one of his golf courses Saturday at the start of the Memorial Day weekend as he urges U.S. states to reopen after coronavirus-related lockdowns. Yet many Americans remained cautious as the number of confirmed cases nationwide passed 1.6 million.
 In California, where many businesses and recreational activities are reopening, officials in Los Angeles County said they would maintain tight restrictions until July 4. Some religious leaders took issue with Trump's declaration that houses of worship are "essential" and should resume in-person services this weekend.
 "Being at the epicenter of this pandemic and in order to protect our flock, we advise that congregations remain closed until more accurate and uniform information is provided," said Bishop Paul Egensteiner, who oversees the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's congregations in the hard-hit New York City region.
 Statewide, New York reported its lowest number of daily coronavirus deaths -- 84 -- in many weeks in what Gov. Andrew Cuomo described as a critical benchmark. The daily death tally peaked at 799 on April 8.
 "For me, it's a sign that we're making real progress," Cuomo said.
 Rain dampened the start of the holiday weekend in the northeastern United States, where newly reopened beaches had been expected to attract throngs of people and test the effectiveness of social distancing rules. At Orchard Beach in the Bronx, which was crowded a weekend earlier, parking lots were mostly empty except for the large puddles.
 Farther south, Trump visited one of his private golf clubs for the first time during the pandemic -- the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. He has been pushing for state and local leaders to fully reopen after months after closures and tight restrictions.
 Parts of New Orleans were stirring to back life, with some restaurants and businesses opening their doors for the first time in more than two months. Some remained closed, especially in the French Quarter, which relies largely on tourist dollars.
 At least a few out-of-towners trickled in. Greer Falls of Augusta, Georgia, wore a mask as he entered the Royal House restaurant for lunch. After weeks at home, he said he was ready for a change of scenery and didn't want to miss a birthday celebration with friends he's known for decades.
 Overseas, there was mixed news. New coronavirus cases in China fell to zero on Saturday for the first time since the start of the outbreak but surged in India and overwhelmed hospitals across Latin America.
 Many governments are easing restrictions as they face a political backlash and historic recessions brought on by the battle against the virus. In just a few months, the pandemic has killed at least 338,000 people worldwide and infected more than 5.2 million, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. It says more than 96,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States.
 Turkey, which has recorded over 155,000 infections, imposed its toughest lockdown measures yet starting Saturday for the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of Ramadan, and Yemen's Houthi rebels urged believers to use masks and stay inside, as authorities try to contain infections at a time usually marked by days of multigenerational feasting and collective prayer.
 In Germany, which has drawn praise for its handling of the virus, seven people appear to have been infected at a restaurant in the northwest of the country. It would be the first known such case since restaurants started reopening two weeks ago.
 And in Frankfurt, more than 40 people tested positive after a church service of the Evangelical Christian Baptist congregation on May 10. The city's health office said one is hospitalized.
 A church leader said the community had complied with all hygiene rules but has canceled all gatherings and is now holding services online. Authorities in nearby Hanau called off Muslim prayers planned for a stadium Sunday as a precaution.
 Religious events helped spread the virus early in the pandemic; resuming gatherings of the faithful is an especially thorny issue.
 Mindful of evangelical Christians who are key to his base of support ahead of November's election, Trump on Friday labeled houses of worship as "essential" and urged governors to let them reopen this weekend. However, leaders of many denominations have said they plan to move gradually and cautiously.
 France allowed in-person services to resume starting Saturday after a legal challenge to the government's ban on gatherings in places of worship.
 One of the world's major pilgrimage sites is reopening Sunday: the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected.
 Latin America is the latest epicenter of the virus, and experts note the limits of government action in a region where millions have informal jobs and many police forces are unable to enforce restrictions.
 Brazil and Mexico reported record numbers of infections and deaths almost daily last week, fueling criticism of their presidents for limited lockdowns. But infections also rose and intensive care units were swamped in Peru, Chile and Ecuador, all countries lauded for imposing early and aggressive business shutdowns and quarantines.
 Concerns are rising in India, where new cases showed another record jump Saturday, topping 6,000 for a second consecutive day as a two-month lockdown has eased.
 While some countries are facing a second wave of infections, badly hit Russia is still struggling with its first, and reported more than 9,000 new daily cases Saturday.

Mr Cummings was also reportedly spotted by another member of public in Houghall Woods near Durham home on 19 April.
 Mr Johnson did not directly dispute the two other allegations about Mr Cummings when they were put to him by a journalist at the news conference.
 The prime minister said he had "looked at them carefully" and was "content that at all times throughout his period in isolation... he behaved responsibly and correctly and with a view to defeating the virus".
 A statement by Durham Police, who say they spoke to Mr Cummings' family, also conflicts with Downing Street's claim the family was not contacted by officers.

 “But all of a sudden, we’re starting to get culture. We’ve got an opera company, several ballet companies, and we’ve matured artistically, and that’s wonderful.”

Regarding “TV’s Great Adjustment” [May 17]: These articles were so stimulating that I immediately wanted to turn to the TV Grid to see what’s on today. In a time when, as you write, many are turning to their television sets— perhaps The Times could see its way clear to restore it.
 As a consolation, and in light of the only returning live sports in Southern California – Horse Racing at Santa Anita – I turned to the Sports section for the race entries and results. That was not successful either.
 I am quite critical of The Times’ failure to accept the 2016 election results but I compliment you on continuing to publish a newspaper in these plague crisis times where there is, no doubt, a shortage of resources and an absence of theater, movies, book debuts and signings, sporting events, etc.
 It can’t be easy and for that I thank you for continuing to publish. I only wish it were a little more balanced.

So there's a growing body of evidence that at least some of the problems caused by SARS-CoV-2 are the result of how the virus manipulates the immune system in order to maintain an infection. How much of the COVID-19 symptoms it explains isn't yet clear, nor is it obvious whether the variability of symptoms is the result of patient-specific immune responses. But in light of this growing body of evidence, it's a safe bet that researchers will be working hard to find out.

Barry Wallach has resigned his position as president of   NBCUniversal Domestic Television. A replacement has not   yet been determined.
 "Barry has led our syndication business with great   distinction," said Ted Harbert, chairman of NBC Broadcasting, in a   statement. "He has been a valued partner and colleague and I will deeply   miss his wise counsel. We thank him for all that he has done for NBCUniversal   and wish him nothing but continued success in the future."
 Wallach sent a letter to his staff on Wednesday and held a   meeting with them, saying that "after an incredible run at NBCUniversal, I   want to share some news. I have been thinking for some time about the   possibility of change and want you all to know that I have decided to leave the   company in the coming weeks.
 "I am finally going to take a deep breath, stop traveling so   much and spend some very important time with my family. I do intend on doing   many things down the road but have no immediate plans.
 "The timing is perfect. I leave our business in terrific   shape, coming off our most successful syndication season to date in both   ratings and profitability. The momentum is on our side, and we are well   positioned to achieve even bigger and better things in 2013 and beyond. I   wouldn't feel comfortable making this decision otherwise."
 This year, NBCU successfully launched _The Steve Harvey   Show_, which is produced by Endemol USA. The show is confirmedto return for season two and NBCU is currently signing deals with stations   through the 2015-16 TV season. NBCU also is renewing its new conflict talker, _Trisha   Goddard_, on stations throughout the country, and it plans to continue to   expand its _Access Hollywood_ spinoff, _Access Hollywood Live_ , to   additional markets.
 Wallach has been president of NBCU Domestic Television   Distribution since May 2004, overseeing the distribution of NBCU-produced   products to all forms of television within the U.S. and Canada. That includes   distributing current TV and film products and library content to broadcast markets.
 Wallach also oversees sales of first-run series such as _Access   Hollywood_, _Steve Harvey_ , _Maury_ , _Jerry Springer_ , _   Steve Wilkos_ and _Trisha Goddard_ to TV stations, and sales of off-net   series such as _30 Rock_ , _The Office_ , _Monk_ and the _Law   & Order_ franchise to TV stations.
 Prior to being promoted to president in 2004, Wallach was   executive VP of NBC Enterprises under Ed Wilson, who launched the syndication   division for NBC. Before that, he was executive VP of domestic syndication for   CBS/Eyemark Entertainment, where he also worked for Wilson. While there,   Wallach sold such shows as _Everybody Loves Raymond_ , _Touched by an   Angel_ and _Martha Stewart_.
