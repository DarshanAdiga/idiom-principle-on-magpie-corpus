Many people realise they need to digitalise as a way to keep their businesses alive during the effects of lockdown, social distancing or sheltering in place. That’s fairly obvious even to devoted traditionalists, but where to start and how we execute are less so.
 I’ve seen a lot of companies embark on these projects and programmes only to fail. With the speed at which organisations are being pressured to change right now, they almost find themselves in a perfect storm to repeat the mistakes, which end up being expensive and time-consuming.
 There’s clearly a lot of scope for many of our businesses to improve how we work and how we serve customers, be they B2B or B2C. Some of our organisations have no choice. They’re rooted in brick-and-mortar constructs now defunct in a novel coronavirus world.
 Thomas Siebel is a billionaire businessman and technologist who authored a book called "Digital Transformation: Survive and Thrive in an Era of Mass Extinction". In it he tells us where to start transforming our businesses.
 “…today, the availability of inexpensive sensors (under $1) and credit card- sized AI supercomputers interconnected by fast networks provide the infrastructure to dramatically transform organisations into real-time adaptive enterprises. Cloud computing, big data, AI, and IOT converge to unlock business value… A key challenge for organisations is how to bring together and leverage these technologies to create meaningful value and positive return on investment.”
 He's right that the challenge lies in uniting the technologies that transform our businesses into real-time, adaptive enterprises. That’s precisely where I’ve seen the failures occur here in South Africa.
 Sometimes IT departments, tempted by the plethora of open source solutions, test them in isolation and find they work, in isolation. But the complexities of integrating them into the organisation’s broader IT ecosystem, as well as the management overhead of many different systems and software, becomes a bridge too far. They’re trying to go it alone because they want to save money or think they’ll be able to do it a lot faster. Both are good goals, but they represent a short-sightedness that causes failure further along the road.
 In many cases, our IT departments are stocked with good people skilled at putting the usual IT tools to work for the business. That’s what they trained to do; it’s what they’ve been doing in businesses for years, and that is why you cannot reasonably expect them to suddenly become experts in whole new fields. Any reasonable person would consult the experts, particularly when you consider projects or programmes of this nature and how deeply and widely they potentially affect the core of the business.
 Our IT people are being asked to go beyond simply replicating existing business processes using new technologies. We’re asking them to use the technologies in ways that create exponential advantage if we want to compete. That requires specialist knowledge and skills.
 Cloud computing, for example, changes how businesses provide servers, storage and applications. You can provision a server running a business system and a database or a software service within hours instead of weeks. Much of it can be automatic so it happens within seconds or minutes instead of hours. That’s a significant change because it’s quick, cheap and effective. It means our businesses can quickly change what we do or how we do it.
 One of the challenges of big data has been the cost to store it and the capability to quickly scale processing it. In the past, it was often more cost-effective to store subsets of data and have experts interpret it. But now it’s often cost-effective to store big volumes of data and process it in parallel in the cloud.
 IOT is about connecting sensors, machines and anything that can provide data to the Internet to share its state, receive information then act on it, or both. It may be simple but it can create enormous potential value, particularly when you combine it with cloud data storage, big data to organise it into information, and AI and ML to use it knowledgeably and effectively.
 AI in essence means making smart machines and software that learn to solve problems and do the work of people. Much of that today focuses on recognising patterns such as fraud, machine and equipment failure, essentially making decisions and acting based on analytics. ML can learn by example. Feed it a few thousand images labelled “damaged” or “undamaged” and it can thereafter determine, quite precisely, quality control of parts coming off the assembly line. It’s much faster and more accurate than people and it’s truly transformative.
 Digitalisation makes work easier, produces more accurate results, and enables automation. But it’s just the first step of the journey. To transform our businesses means extracting deeper value in future from the tools and materials many of us desperately crave right now because of the global pandemic. We can only achieve that with sound advice and expert guidance to ensure we build the foundations of real-time, adaptive enterprises.

Quanto alle misure contenute nel decreto Maggio (anche detto "decreto Aprile/Maggio", o ancora "Cura Italia bis", _ndr_ ), il primo ministro italiano spiega che potrebbero essere introdotti dei «fondi per la ristrutturazione degli immobili a tasso zero», nonché un piano straordinario per l’edilizia scolastica e a un "piano estivo" per i bambini. Su uno dei nodi su cui è bloccato il Governo, ossia sui prestiti alle aziende e sul ruolo che debba ricoprire lo Stato in questo frangente, Conte dichiara che «le banche temono di essere coinvolte un domani nel concorso in reati collegati alla bancarotta. In pratica di aver contribuito a tenere artificiosamente in vita aziende già decotte. Il Governo lavorerà per trovare una soluzione equa». Molte imprese «non verranno nazionalizzate», assicura Conte, ma verranno valutate le diverse tipologie di aiuti presenti nel ventaglio dei sostegni alle imprese, «in alcuni casi anche attraverso capitale, finanziando direttamente l'impresa per facilitare investimenti produttivi e consentire il consolidamento dell'organismo societario».

The number of meals soon outgrew that kitchen so, in 1985, they raised enough money to build what is now the Ted Adcock Community Center. This was the first community-built kitchen on the Coastside. The group moved there, along with Coastside Opportunity Center (now Coastside Hope) and Half Moon Bay Parks and Recreation Department, and added many other activities and services beyond the meal program.
 By 1995, it was clear that both Senior Coastsiders and the Coastside Adult Day Health Center needed more space. In 2014, after one of the Coastside’s longest and largest public fundraising efforts, the Senior Coastsiders community-built kitchen filled its refrigerator, fired up the ovens, and laid out the tablecloths at 925 Main St.
 Over the past six years, our senior population has grown significantly in parallel with increased demand for services focused on older adults, but no one could have foreseen the central role our community-built kitchen would play when the dangers of COVID-19 required our most vulnerable citizens to shelter in place.
 The week of March 2, Senior Coastsiders served 437 meals — about half served in the dining room and half delivered. By April 6, the crew home-delivered 1,195 meals. That's an increase of 274 percent in a month! And those are just the meals prepared specifically for Coastside seniors. There are hundreds more meals coming out of your community-built kitchen.
 For many years Senior Coastsiders has partnered with the No Strings Attached Breakfast and Table of Plenty. By sharing our community-built kitchen, these programs have been able to transform their operations from sit-down dining to home delivery or “grab-and-go.” So together, these three programs are serving Coastside families over 1,600 meals a week.
 Your community-built kitchen has become a center of creative thinking, innovation, and risk management. Just imagine what it takes for the staff and volunteers of these three organizations to provide so many meals. Anyone who’s been to a grocery store knows that food supplies are disrupted. Add to that the need to maintain health regulations for seven delivery routes (walking and driving), including gloves, masks, physical distancing, safely preparing and packaging the food, and creating entirely new, volunteer-based, home delivery systems. To ensure minimum disruption to the home-delivery cycle, should a Senior Coastsiders staff member or volunteer become ill or exposed to the virus, an entire backup crew of cooks, delivery volunteers and required staff is organized and stands ready to activate.
 Meanwhile, your community-built kitchen requires a continuous stream of funding and donations. Federal funding distributed by the county doesn’t come close to covering the cost of each home-delivered meal, so donations from the clients we serve and the generosity of our community are essential. We are now in a recession that many say will be long and deep. Research indicates that after the 2008 recession, public donation revenue dropped by 7 percent in 2008 and by another 6.2 percent in 2009. As a result of the pandemic, Senior Coastsiders has had to cancel the annual Seniors Night Out and the Home Repair Day. Other major fundraising events that also generate important connections with the community could potentially be canceled as well.

Voters will have four choices, including Justin Hubbs, for two positions on the State Fair Community College Board of Trustees in next month’s election.
 Hubbs, who ran for the board in 2016, also faces Richard L. Parker, Christopher Paszkiewicz and WyAnn Lipps in the June 2 municipal election. Board members Jerry Greer and Ron Wineinger decided not to seek re-election so two seats are up for grabs.
 Hubbs spent 21 years working in retail, 17 of those years in management positions. He now works as a realtor in Sedalia. He also spent the last three years as a member of the State Fair Community College Foundation board.
 “I learned a lot the last three years serving on the foundation board since my previous election attempt,” Hubbs said of why he decided to run for the board again. “There’s a lot going on at the college, there’s a lot going on in the community and I feel like there’s a really close connection there between the two. That really drove my motivation to run now.”
 Last year, SFCC decided to move forward with the Olen Howard Workforce Innovation Center. The proposed $9 million facility will house the college and Career and Technology Center’s welding and precision machine programs.
 “When the campaign was on the ballot four years ago, we needed it then so the need is absolutely there now,” Hubbs said. “I applaud the board, (President) Dr. (Joanna) Anderson, (Foundation Executive Director) Mary Treuner and the foundation, I think that was a complete work in progress to get us to where we are today on it. We can’t build it quick enough for the need.”
 Hubbs said the future center could help with the college’s declining enrollment, a trend being seen at community colleges across Missouri. He said it’s also important to showcase to area businesses how SFCC can help their workforce.
 “Yes, enrollment may be down, I think that is because as a country we’ve lost the technical side of that and we need to continue to educate that. The average age of a plumber or electrician is retirement age and you have nobody to replace them, that’s the avenue we need to keep attacking,” Hubbs said. “We’ve got to keep showing the benefit that we have low cost, quick turnaround on certificates, getting you trained, get you right in the workplace.”
 While workforce development is a legislative priority for Gov. Mike Parson and SFCC continues to expand its offerings, Hubbs said the college should have an “equal blend” of workforce training and traditional programs. He cited SFCC’s partnerships with Central Methodist University, the University of Missouri and the University of Central Missouri as ways the college is helping students seeking two-year degrees.
 “I think those partnerships are key … But again, our technical workforce development is so large right now and there’s such a high demand, we’ve got to make that our priority,” he said. “Look at the amount of businesses coming to the state of Missouri, look at the number of businesses that call the college looking for students from St. Louis, Chicago, Denver. It’s a large need but definitely don’t want to underestimate the general student too.”
 Hubbs said employee compensation is something the board should look at consistently but that employee appreciation and understanding is just as important.
 “If you don’t give your people the recognition when it’s due and you don’t give them the tools and resources, you’re not giving them the ability to do their job,” he said. “So yes, you always have to look at pay and how does it fit in the budget, how does it work out, what can we do, but I also think we can do a better job of not stretching our faculty so thin and really showing them the appreciation they deserve.”
 Hubbs said he thinks the board and college could do a better job of highlighting SFCC on a local and state level. He said college officials need to make sure legislators in Jefferson City understand SFCC’s funding needs.
 Hubbs said it’s important for SFCC to also highlight its extended campus at the Lake of the Ozarks. In June, Camdenton R-III School District voters will consider a proposal to annex the district into the Ozark Technical Community College taxing area. According to the Springfield News-Leader, voters must approve a tax levy of 20 cents per $100 of assessed valuation to join OTC.
 The SFCC board issued a resolution in January opposing the annexation.
 “(We need to ensure) we’re doing everything we can to educate the residents of that area that we are offering them a service for the last 36 years that they have not had to pay a tax on and now you’ve got the College of the Ozarks coming in to make that tax. I think that’s very vital too,” Hubbs said.
 If elected, Hubbs said he plans to “be open-minded but also ask the tough questions.”
 “I do feel like my experience through my career, my experience through the Foundation board and really the passion and drive I have for the community. I think those three things really light a fire to ensure we continue to grow the college, grow the community,” Hubbs said. “I’m going to go in there and put all those resources to use. This is a college I want to be around when my three girls come through and I think continued growth and development, ensuring we’re making the right choices will allow that.”

Nothing should be out of the blue. We know there is no cure as of now and secondly, an element of uncertainty persists. Red, orange or green colours put on the map demarcates district-wise mapping of the country. But for me its red, orange or yellow in Chhattisgarh, and purposefully I will not hold or assume any district on to green zone since 80 per cent of those who may catch the virus are going to be asymptomatic if the experts are to be believed. Another theoretical presumption is potential risk remains for around 20-60 per cent of India's 25-80 crore population. In the context of Chhattisgarh, our team of experts arrived on the assumption that 30 per cent of the 3 crore population of Chhattisgarh may be affected. Even if not being so apprehensive and going by just 10 per cent then also it's going to be 30 lakh, which is quite high. So, we need to be prepared.

"While nine out of 10 Internet users in urban India access the Internet at least once a week, in rural India, there is an addition of 30 million new users who access the internet daily compared to March 2019," said IAMAI.
 In India, close to a third of users access the Internet for more than one hour during Sundays/holidays versus a normal working day.
 The time spent on the Internet continues to be higher in urban India compared to rural India.
 According to the report, with better connectivity, quality of service, and affordability of mobile Internet, there could be an increase in rural consumers spending more time on the internet in future.
 Interestingly, the report found that 26 million new female Internet users were added by November 2019 which is a 21% increase compared to that of 9% increase in male users.
 While the proportion of male Internet users in rural India is more than double than female internet users, however, usage of Internet among females in rural India is growing at a fast clip with 31% increase in Internet population in November 2019 compared to March 2019.
 The research showed that mobile continues to remain the device of choice for accessing Internet in both urban and rural regions.

 As states reopen for business, there could be an increase in COVID-19 cases in some states. This could result in more stringent limits on large gatherings.
 There are other major events scheduled this year that could be impacted by the pandemic. The Norsk Hostfest already canceled this year’s event and promises to return next year. The North Dakota State Fair and the United Tribes International Powwow also face difficult decisions down the road.

Like many in her profession, nursing was a calling for Pettis County Health Center Administrator JoAnn Martin. Inspired by her mother and a series of books from her youth, Martin is now responsible for guiding Pettis County through a pandemic that the nation and world have never experienced.
 Martin is a graduate of the University of Missouri-Columbia and has advanced degrees from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the University of Alabama in Birmingham. She began her career at the health center in 2002 as the Epidemiology Specialist under a Bioterrorism Grant.
 “I don't ever remember a time when I did not want to be a nurse,” Martin said. “I wanted to help people. I read all the Cherry Ames books when I was growing up and I was inspired by all the good things she got to do.”
 Martin explained she wanted to go to Deaconess School of Nursing in St. Louis because they had a cool cap, which she said, tongue in cheek, was a “great reason, right?”
 Her mother worked at a nursing home and the lead nurse encouraged Martin to go to college. The advice led Martin to the University of Missouri-Columbia.
 Only months ago, few in Pettis County may have known of Martin and her work. As the administrator for the health center prior to the pandemic, Martin was responsible for attending numerous meetings to represent the health center. She answered questions, managed the business of the health center and even got to see clients.
 Since the pandemic’s arrival, her work has changed in many ways.
 “I don't go anywhere,” Martin said. “I now worry about not only the well-being of the staff but the well-being of the entire community on a different level.
 “I worry that the decisions that are made will contribute to more people becoming ill who could have been protected with a different decision,” she continued. “I worry about all the people who have lost jobs because of the need to be closed. I worry about all the children at home who are trying to complete their education this year and the parents who are trying to help them, but more about the children who have no one to help them. I worry about the teachers who are trying to do their best…”
 As a member of the Pettis County COVID-19 Task Force, Martin and other elected and appointed leaders meet twice weekly if not more to discuss the ever- changing situations facing the county and its residents. By state statute, as the Health Center Administrator, Martin is tasked with issuing health orders and decisions for the county.
 All of Pettis County remains under the same guidelines. This includes establishments and residents in the City of Sedalia and surrounding townships within Pettis County. Martin issued a new health order for Pettis County on Saturday that will remain in effect until May 31.
 “According to the statutes, if a city does not have an established health department, then the public health authority resides with the recognized local public health agency for the county,” Martin said last week. “There are no other recognized health departments in the county, so the Pettis County Health Center remains the public health authority for the county.”
 Pettis County Presiding Commissioner David Dick, who oversees the task force meetings, is grateful for Martin’s knowledge and advice.
 “I am glad to be working with someone who has my full trust and confidence,” Dick commented via text. “She has been a source of reason and information that has the community and its health at the forefront. Her time at the health center has shown a consistent focus on delivering programs and services.”
 Dick, who has known Martin for more than a decade, also applauds Martin’s staff for the work they are doing each day to ensure the safety of the community.
 “She has a staff that is remarkably capable and responsible to carry out their task and keep the citizens and their families first,” Dick noted. “She has put together a very excellent staff that is long on depth and experience. They are all capable and focused.”
 Martin too is extremely grateful for her staff: “I want them to get the credit as they are working really hard.”

GREENHALGH - Joseph M. August 26, 1926 April 30, 2020 Joe Greenhalgh passed away peacefully on the morning of April 30th, surrounded by his family (many on video conference) as they were telling stories about his colorful, cheerful life. It was his sense of deadpan humor-equal parts self-deprecating and naughty-which made Joe such a fun and memorable guy to know and to be around. His life was defined by a strong work ethic and a devotion to family and friends, but even at the age of 93, his mischievous spirit was still vital and intact. Very recently, when doctors would ask Joe if he was married, he would say, "No, but, well, my girlfriend just took a pregnancy test...." Joe was born in Bay Shore, NY, on the south shore of Long Island. He was 15 years old when the United States entered World War II and he enlisted to serve on the day after his 17th birthday. He joined the Navy instead of the Marines, based on which elevator door opened first at the recruitment office-one of many gambles that Joe would make over the course of his life (including at one of his favorite places, the racetrack). During the war, while serving aboard the flight deck of the U.S.S. Essex in the Pacific, he once witnessed the officers to his left and right be shot and wounded during an air attack. "I was too dumb to be scared," he would later tell his grandchildren. Upon returning to the US, Joe met his wife Lillian on a blind date in Seattle. They married in 1946 and raised their four children in Bay Shore, NY. He worked as a driver for the bakery company Entenmann's for three decades and coached kids on local Little League teams, many of whom kept in touch with Joe for decades. After the passing of his wife in 1977, he moved to the Seattle area, where he owned and operated the Club Tavern, a popular local pub in Sumner, WA, and was married to Dixie Greenhalgh until her death in 1993. In 2011, he relocated to Boise, ID. Friendships were a huge source of joy for Joe. He cherished memories of life-long high school pals Al Karlson and Walt Bunge. Wash Dayton was a great friend and coworker at Entenmann's. And Jack Roesel, together with Joe, built and owned a home on Fire Island, NY (named the Green-Rose) that still stands today. During the last year of his life, his best buddy was Darryl Dillon, a fellow resident at Grace Assisted Living in Boise, ID, where the two men were frequently observed off-roading on their mechanical scooters. As a patriarch, Joe was filled with love and pride for his family. He is survived by three of his children, Debbie Randolph of Boise, ID; George Greenhalgh of Redmond, WA; and Alan Greenhalgh of Littleton, CO; their spouses Chris Randolph, Barbara Greenhalgh and Karen Greenhalgh; and his younger brother George, 92, of Lindenhurst, NY. He was predeceased exactly five months earlier by his daughter Donna McGovern of Fort Collins, CO. He is also survived by eight grandchildren (Ian, Tracie, Joe, Kerrie, Katy, Caysie, Jill and Sara), their spouses (Rob, Lani, Rich, and Rob), and eight great- grandchildren (Kyle, George, Brody, Henry, Alex, Harper, Roman, and Oliver). His verve for life and his amusingly askew view of the world will be terribly missed. As will his softer, more sentimental side. Among the belongings in his bedroom was a card that Joe had recently written, to be read after his death. It is addressed simply "To Whom" (a classic Joe enigma) but inside, in his own handwriting, it mentions his children and their spouses and reads: "I can't say how blessed we were to have such a wonderful family. God bless you all. Dad, Daddy, Old Man, etc." Memorial contributions may be made to two of Joe's favorite organizations,

It's a lousy title - one that isn't explained till just before the end credits run - but it's not a bad movie. Neither, unfortunately, is much of a good movie. Even so, the target audience of female tweens and teens, as well as some slightly older young women, just might eat this up.      The opening shot, a full-screen close-up on the face of Johanna Morrigan (Beanie Feldstein, from "Lady Bird" and "Booksmart") makes it clear that this is going to be a story about her ... about her insecurities, her dreams, her missteps, and eventually her redemption.      It's 1993. She's 16, lives with her family in the British town of Wolverhampton, and is an overachiever at school, always writing long-winded essays, much to the consternation of her English teacher. But writing is her passion; the girl can't help it.      She also has a regular practice of escaping from reality, and spends a great deal of time in her bedroom, having conversations, in a Harry Potter-like manner, with photos and paintings on her wall. And those folks on the wall - Sigmund Freud, Sylvia Plath, and Maria von Trapp among them - are ready to offer some advice, at least in Johanna's head.      Though the family is close, there are money problems. Breeding border collies doesn't quite pay the bills. On top of that, mom (Sarah Solemani) has a touch of depression, and loose, laidback dad (Paddy Considine, terrific in the role), is a bit of a scoundrel, as well as being a frustrated ex-drummer who still wants to play in a pop band.      Johanna's hopes are boosted when she hears of an opening to be a rock critic at the (fictional) London fanzine Disc and Music Echo, and even though her taste in music leans toward "Tomorrow" from "Annie," she catches a break, due in part to an assignment that no one at the magazine wants, and gets a gig covering a concert.      But first, she decides to reinvent herself, physically changing her appearance and wardrobe from the relatively bland Johanna Morrigan to the glitzy, lipsticked, top-hatted Dolly Wilde. From that point on, every scene, and almost every moment of the movie, rests on the shoulders of Feldstein, who goes at it with a big dose of frenetic energy and a winning smile. Her dream is coming true, she lands more review assignments, and she tries for a step up the freelance ladder by asking to write a feature - and getting a yes.      This leads to a third strong performance in the film - after those of Feldstein and Considine - and the introduction of pop star and singer of sad songs John Kite (Alfie Allen, Theon from "Game of Thrones"), who is to be her first interview subject (and it turns out that Allen is a very good singer!).      Complications arise, the term "off the record" might not be quite clear to the novice interviewer, emotions veer out of control, things go badly, and a John Kite poster starts talking to her, attempting to help her out of the problems she inadvertently creates for herself. One of them involves the changes she finds herself going through. Her magazine wants tough stories, not fawning pieces, and Johanna plunges down a dark hole that results in new, not very pleasant personalities taking root in her. Her profiles and reviews turn nasty, her attitude toward her family becomes one of a jerk, she becomes recognized for her "toxic writing," and she's proud of it.      She morphs into a protagonist that no one will be rooting for, not even that young target audience. Most of this works quite well in a dramatic sense. But some lazy writing late in the film leads to a lame plot twist that turns everything around too conveniently, with wrongs being righted too easily.      For a brief moment, the film again finds its footing, with Alfie Allen's acting range saving the day, but then we get an unnecessary breaking of the fourth wall at the very end with a message delivered to anyone still interested - those young girls again - to be yourself. That lesson was already there, in the words of the characters. It sure didn't need to be given twice.      "How to Build a Girl" premieres on VOD platforms on May 8.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

Our dad wasn’t always excited for us to stop work to attend baseball practices and games, but mom encouraged our participation. We certainly didn’t mind the break from work and looked forward to practices and games. Our baseball coach happened to be our high school principal, and he coached all the teams from pee wees through the Legion team. It didn’t take Pete, the name everyone called him, to realize that the country boys could play baseball. He noticed that we not only practiced during his workouts, but that we had been playing baseball for years with our siblings in the pastures and yards on the farm and were fundamentally pretty good at fielding, throwing and hitting. We didn’t take family vacations; baseball games and one tournament at the end of each season was the highlight of our summer.
 Once our dad realized we could play baseball and still get all the work done, he allowed us to play other sports as well. We played football in the fall and basketball in the winter, but track was off limits. That was when dad needed us the most for spring planting. Since Montrose High School was a small school, I participated and practiced with my three older brothers during the football and basketball seasons.
 Nearly all of us played three sports throughout our high school careers. Some of us continued to play for our local town baseball team for a few years and most of us continued to play softball for several years. Three of my brothers played in tournaments in Sioux Falls and surrounding areas on a softball team made up of former local baseball players. A lot of their opponents found out rather quickly that those farm boys from Montrose could play ball. They didn’t play in the highest league, but they won numerous softball tournaments while playing into their 30’s and 40’s.
 My wife and I have three grown children. Each participated in sports from ages 7-18. I was fortunate to coach each of them during several softball and baseball seasons. Our family loves to spend time together at all types of high school, college, and professional sporting events. I am an uncle to more than 130 nephews and nieces. Most of them have participated in sports, whether it be at a small, rural school or a large high school. Several have been fortunate to play at the collegiate level.
 I guess you could say that the love of sports continues in the Struck family. I guess it takes time to realize sacrifices parents make for their children. I’m thankful for the sacrifices our mom and dad made so we could participate in sports. Some parents are willing to make sacrifices for their children to enable them to have opportunities that they never had. Thanks mom and dad for our love of sports.

It wasn’t all work and no play. We usually found time each day to play ball. We spent many days playing baseball in the small pasture just west of our house. In the fall, we played football in that same pasture. In the winter, we played basketball under a hoop fastened to one of our granaries. Needless to say, when we weren’t doing chores or working in the fields, we were usually playing some type of ball.
 After I finished my third grade year, our country school closed. This meant that my siblings and I would be attending Montrose Public School. My mom thought it would be good for us to play baseball in town so that we could get to know other kids before we began school that fall. It wasn’t easy for her to persuade my dad that this was a good idea. How were we going to care for the livestock and crops with the boys running off to baseball practice and games two or three afternoons each week? My mom ultimately convinced my dad, and we began playing baseball that summer.

Kellyanne Conway suggested we should just shrug off the 70,000+ American deaths from coronavirus because Trump warned us "all along" (even though he didn’t). Yet she went on to repeatedly call Trump “this health care president.”
 During her visit to Fox & Friends this morning, cohost Brian Kilmeade began by citing a New York Times report that a Trump administration model predicts coronavirus cases and deaths will nearly double by June 1. “Are those the numbers that you’ve heard circulate around the White House, too?” Kilmeade asked.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a second experiment, again with three groups, and this time with a sample of college students around the US. The first group was exposed to _The_ _Hunger Games_ and, as before, we included a second, no-media control group. The third group, however, was exposed to violent scenes from the _Fast and Furious_ movie franchise (2001-), similar in length and type to the violence in the _Hunger Games_ excerpts.

Berlin plans to allow Germany's Bundesliga to restart behind closed doors in May after weeks of shutdown imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus, according to a draft government agreement seen by AFP Wednesday.
 Politicians believe restarting play in the first and second divisions to "limit the economic damage" for the 36 clubs is "acceptable", the document showed.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel and state premiers will set a date for the games to begin in a telephone conference later Wednesday, with German media reporting May 21 was a possible candidate.
 "Restarting match activity must be preceded by a two-week quarantine, where appropriate in the form of a training camp" for players, the document read.
   
   
 Germany's influential DFL football league has long urged restarting play, which it says is vital for a sector that employs 56,000 people in Germany.
 It has offered authorities a strict infection control plan based on numerous coronavirus tests, which it says would allow the competition to be relaunched with low risk.
 Health Minister Jens Spahn has judged that the scheme "makes sense and can serve as an example for other forms of professional sport," although "it has to be lived up to".
 German clubs stand to recoup 300 million euros ($325 million) in TV rights if they are allowed to contest the nine remaining match days in the Bundesliga season.
 That could help soak up some of their financial losses, with more than a dozen of the 36 first- and second-division teams on the brink of bankruptcy according to media reports.
 The DFL will hold a general meeting by video conference Thursday where representatives from the clubs will finalise details of the restart.
 Most have already begun training again in anticipation.

He moved to Houston at the age of two and considered himself a lifelong Texan and Houstonian.   Beau attended the University of Texas at Austin where he met his wife Susan.

Beau will be remembered for his incredible sense of humor, his love of rock 'n roll music, and more than anything how much he loved his three daughters.

Kolkata Knight Riders CEO Venky Mysore did not entirely rule out the possibility of the popular IPL franchise "evaluating" investment opportunities in England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)'s ambitious franchise league 'The Hundred', which had to be shelved this year due to COVID-19 pandemic. British newspaper 'The Telegraph' on Tuesday quoted Mysore saying that they would surely be keen to "explore" investment opportunities in The Hundred.
 However the KKR CEO was categorical that at this moment it's nothing more than speculations. "I know this story is going around. All I said was 'if we are approached to consider investing in 'The Hundred', we will evaluate it'," Mysore told PTI, reacting to the report in the English daily.
 Owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, the two-time IPL champions had in 2015 acquired Caribbean Premier League side Trinidad & Tobago Red Steel, who are now known as Trinbago Knight Riders, a winner of successive CPL titles in 2017 and 2018. They also had acquired a third team, the Cape Town franchise in Cricket South Africa's Global T20 league which however did not see the light of the day and was cancelled in 2017.
 "We are the biggest brand in IPL and perhaps the only global brand in cricket. So we can understand why leagues around the world would be interested in getting Knight Riders on board," Mysore said.
   
   
 A brainchild of the ECB, The Hundred will be 100-balls-per-side format and will be played by eight franchises rather than the established 18 first-class counties.
 It was slated for a July start but only to be pushed till 2021 with ECB grappling in financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 According to ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, they are slated to incur a loss of over GBP 300 million, if the upcoming season is wiped out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Hello Baraza,_
  _I am a young professional looking to buy my first car in the next four months. I have been going through various options and frankly feeling overwhelmed on the choice to make. My budget is between Sh600,000 and Sh 700,000. The key features I am looking for are durability and affordability in terms of maintenance and fuel consumption. I had thought of the Nissan Tiida or Nissan Note (new shape) but changed my mind on learning about the gearbox problems Nissans manufactured from 2013 upwards have. I am currently toying with the idea of getting either the Peugeot 207 or the Mazda Verisa but I am open to other suggestions. Your recommendation would be highly appreciated._
  _Kind Regards,_
  _Jess_
 Hi Jess,
 Well, you were wise to heed the naysayers and steer clear of the Notes and Tiidas. They do seem to have consistent difficulties with the transmission, particularly the Note. A friend of a friend is currently playing a game of thimble rig with two lazy-matics and three TCMs and/or ECUs (the little compu- thingies that are the brains of an engine and/or slush-matic tranny), one of which is not even model-specific and will therefore not work. The choice between the 207 and the Verisa will depend on how much you like to drive. Both drive quite well, but the Peugeot is marginally more engaging — so marginally that it will take a hardened petrolhead made edgy by the strongest coffee to suss out these differences, but the differences are there. Incidentally, the 207’s controls are also soft to the point of stodginess, which is at odds with my earlier allegation, but listen, cars are complex, multidimensional inventions, things are not always black and white with them.

Crystal D. Hill 1966-2020 Crystal Danette Hill, 53, of Boise passed away April 30th 2020, at St. Luke's Hospital in Meridian. Crystal was born August 22, 1966 in Boise, Idaho at St. Alphonsus hospital. She was the third child born to Jerry and Pauline Hill. Crystal was an adventurous and vivacious person from the time she was a young girl. She was full of imagination and had a love for life. She loved to listen to music and do sing- alongs to records with her best-friend Shawana, who would have the privilege to remain her lifelong friend. As a teen she could often be found at Skate- land on Overland or at the Diamond Mine in Garden City. It's there that Crystal found another of her life's passions…dancing. Dancing would be her go to escape throughout her life and she was wonderful at it. People loved to watch, even when there was no one to dance with she would be on the dance floor, the center of everyone's attention, though she hardly noticed. She danced for herself and she loved it. She had a yearning to travel right out of high school. Moving to Maui, becoming a nanny in New York, and listening to the choir at the church next door in Philadelphia. But Boise was home, it was where her family was. At twenty-five she purchased her own home and started her own business. She enjoyed her "Crystal Clear Window Cleaning" business, being her own boss and getting to know her clients was a personal achievement for her. Though many thought she might never stop her wandering with her adventurous spirit, she found the thing she loved more than anything else. It has been almost twenty years since a little smile and beautiful spirit stole Crystal's heart and soul. From the moment she became a mom, you wouldn't know there had ever been anything more important. She took all the love and knowledge of what a wonderful childhood meant from her loving parents, grandparents, and older siblings, to make sure her good Karma had a safe, stable and loving home. Karma would be Crystal's only focus above all else for the rest of her life. Crystal will be missed every day, every holiday, every life event to come, but her spirit will remain. Her soft smile and beautiful soul remembered forever. Crystal is survived by her daughter Karma, her parents Jerry and Pauline, her grandmother Dorothy, her siblings Jerilyn and David, nephews Kyle and Jordan, and great-nephew Bronson. And her best dog, Booton, who has been her loyal companion for all his eleven years. She is proceeded in death by her grandparents Jake and Margaret Wisdom, grandfather Roy Hill, and five cousins. Her viewing will be Thursday May 7th, at the Bowman Funeral Home on State street at 10 a.m. Graveside services are at 12 p.m. at Terrace Lawn Memorial Cemetery in Boise. Memorial donations can be made for her daughter Karma Hill to help with her college education. To leave the family condolences please visit www.bowmanfuneral.com

Someday, Grant Bieser is going to have a great story to tell his children. Well, that's when Grant is a bit older and learns how to talk.
   
 That's because the son of Truman High School activities director Daniel Bieser celebrated his first birthday during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "Our daughter Vivian turned 4 in March, just before all the quarantine stuff happened," said Bieser, the Patriots' first-year activities director who is now playing daddy to his two young children while still taking care of all his prep duties. "So she had the big birthday party.
   
 "Grant was 1 on April 12, and we had the big 1-year-old birthday party planned in St. Louis with all our relatives - and of course, it didn't happen because of the coronavirus quarantine.
   
 "I know my wife and our relatives were a lot more disappointed than a 1-year- old, but boy, is he ever going to have a story to tell his kids and grandkids one day - having your first birthday during the COVID-19 quarantine."
   
 Bieser is a glass half full kind of administrator, and despite some frustrations, he is making the most of working at home and Zooming with his coaches and fellow administrators rather than meeting with them face to face.
   
 "I can't speak for everyone, but I'm about Zoomed out," he joked. "We have the Zoom meetings weekly, to keep in touch and stay up to date on everything.
   
 "But I can't wait for the time I can walk down the hallways, into a classroom, our gym or the weight room and visit face-to-face with one of our coaches. You don't know how much you miss that face-to-face time, those in-person conversations, until you can't have them anymore."
   
 He paused for a moment, and added, "And I can't even tell you how excited I am about going back and watching a sporting event. This week would have been the leadup to district and state and I think about that so much - what our kids, especially our seniors, are missing. What we're all missing!
   
 "I know we're experiencing the new normal, and I want to go back to the old normal. And I know it's going to happen someday; it just can't get here soon enough for me."
   
 Bieser could spend hours talking about his love of Truman High School, and he does a great job talking about the silver lining moments he has experienced during the quarantine.
   
 "We still have staff handing out meals to the kids who need to get their meals from the school district, and that fills me with pride," he said. "We have such great leadership - you see (Independence Superintendent) Dr. (Dale) Herl on a school bus, riding around Independence handing out food to families.
   
 "They are making quarantine masks over at Chrisman and even though our doors are closed, our teachers are still teaching and our students are still learning.
   
 "And for me personally, I've had more dinners at home the past six weeks than I have had the past 10 years that I have been a teacher and coach in the school district.
   
 "I get to stay home with Vivian and Grant and they just make me laugh all day. And they keep me on toes - boy, do they keep me on my toes."

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau deflected questions Tuesday about why it took more than 12 hours for the Canadian Armed Forces to confirm a military helicopter had crashed and when he found out that horrified crew members on board a Halifax-class frigate had watched it go down.
 "The military has very important protocols in place when there is a tragic incident like this around informing the next of kin, talking to the families as quickly as possible before sharing information with the general public," Trudeau said. "All those protocols were followed."
 The Cyclone helicopter carrying six Armed Forces members crashed into the Ionian Sea off the coast of Greece on April 29. Defence officials have said it was returning to HMCS Fredericton at the end of a NATO training mission.

The Israeli Navy will not participate in RIMPAC 2020 as planned due to the continued spread of the deadly coronavirus, _The Jerusalem Post_ has learnt.
 The biennial Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) multinational naval exercise led by the US 3rd fleet off of the coast of Hawaii and Southern California in August has been held every two years since the early 1970s and is considered the world's largest maritime exercise.
 Israel took part in the exercise for the first time in 2018 along with 26 other nations, 47 surface ships, five submarines, 18 national land forces, and more than 200 aircraft and 25,000 personnel.
 The Israeli military cancelled all joint military drills in March due to the outbreak of the pandemic and a IDF Spokesperson told The Post that despite the decrease of cases in Israel, the military will hold off until July to reassess the situation.
 Due to the coronavirus, the US Navy said the drills this year will be held only at sea with a minimal footprint on shore "to ensure the safety of all military forces participating," read a statement released by the US Navy Pacific Fleet.
 The exercise will include multinational anti-submarine warfare, maritime intercept operations, and live-fire training events, among other cooperative training opportunities.
 There will also be no social events and Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam will only be accessible for logistics support with a small number of staff for command and control, logistics and other support functions.
 Similar to 2018, the Israeli Navy was not set to send naval vessels to take part in the drill, rather troops were to take part in shore-based exercises. With those being cancelled, "Israel will not take part in RIMPAC 2020," an IDF spokesperson said.
 The theme of RIMPAC 2018 being "Capable Adaptive Partners" and the drill will work to increase multinational cooperation and trust as well as enhance interoperability of troops and strategic maritime partnerships.
 "We remain committed to and capable of safeguarding allies and partners throughout the Indo-Pacific region," said Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet Adm. John Aquilino. "The flexible approach to RIMPAC 2020 strikes the right balance between combating future adversaries and the COVID-19 threat."
 According to a report in Defense News, Hawaii Gov. David Ige had asked the military to postpone the drills "until the COVID-19 situation here in the islands subsides" and as such the drill has been reduced to two weeks from August 17-31 instead of the usual five weeks from late June to early August.

Crystal D. Hill   1966-2020   Crystal Danette Hill, 53, of Boise passed away April 30th 2020, at St. Luke's Hospital in Meridian.   Crystal was born August 22, 1966 in Boise, Idaho at St. Alphonsus hospital. She was the third child born to Jerry and Pauline Hill.   Crystal was an adventurous and vivacious person from the time she was a young girl. She was full of imagination and had a love for life.   She loved to listen to music and do sing-alongs to records with her best- friend Shawana, who would have the privilege to remain her lifelong friend. As a teen she could often be found at Skate-land on Overland or at the Diamond Mine in Garden City. It's there that Crystal found another of her life's passions…dancing. Dancing would be her go to escape throughout her life and she was wonderful at it. People loved to watch, even when there was no one to dance with she would be on the dance floor, the center of everyone's attention, though she hardly noticed. She danced for herself and she loved it.   She had a yearning to travel right out of high school. Moving to Maui, becoming a nanny in New York, and listening to the choir at the church next door in Philadelphia. But Boise was home, it was where her family was. At twenty-five she purchased her own home and started her own business. She enjoyed her "Crystal Clear Window Cleaning" business, being her own boss and getting to know her clients was a personal achievement for her.   Though many thought she might never stop her wandering with her adventurous spirit, she found the thing she loved more than anything else. It has been almost twenty years since a little smile and beautiful spirit stole Crystal's heart and soul. From the moment she became a mom, you wouldn't know there had ever been anything more important. She took all the love and knowledge of what a wonderful childhood meant from her loving parents, grandparents, and older siblings, to make sure her good Karma had a safe, stable and loving home. Karma would be Crystal's only focus above all else for the rest of her life.   Crystal will be missed every day, every holiday, every life event to come, but her spirit will remain. Her soft smile and beautiful soul remembered forever.   Crystal is survived by her daughter Karma, her parents Jerry and Pauline, her grandmother Dorothy, her siblings Jerilyn and David, nephews Kyle and Jordan, and great-nephew Bronson. And her best dog, Booton, who has been her loyal companion for all his eleven years.   She is proceeded in death by her grandparents Jake and Margaret Wisdom, grandfather Roy Hill, and five cousins.   Her viewing will be Thursday May 7th, at the Bowman Funeral Home on State street at 10 a.m.   Graveside services are at 12 p.m. at Terrace Lawn Memorial Cemetery in Boise.   Memorial donations can be made for her daughter Karma Hill to help with her college education.   To leave the family condolences please visit www.bowmanfuneral.com

In view of University Grants Commission (UGC)'s suggestive guidelines, Allahabad University (AU) has decided to conduct year ending exam of undergraduate courses from July 1 and that of postgraduate courses from July 16.
 Besides, the central varsity has also decided that admission process for the next academic session (2020-21) would restart from May 10, informed varsity officials.
 It has also been decided that viva voce examination of those PhD candidates who have submitted their thesis would be conducted through online mode, they added
 In a meeting of the examination committee that was held on the campus on Monday evening, it was decided that the exams for UG courses that were interrupted because of the nationwide lockdown from March 24, will now be held from July 1. The examination committee has also decided that the exam would be held every day in three shifts and that too on all the seven days of the week including Sundays. Earlier, AU used to conduct exams in two shifts, morning and post-noon only.
   
   
 Likewise, for postgraduate courses (semester system), the exams would be conducted from July 16 and the same would be held in two shifts. Earlier, the PG exams were held in just one shift per day and that too on just five days a week.
 Following the suggestive guidelines issued by UGC on the concept of social distancing, varsity authorities have decided that there would be sufficient distance between two examinees. For following the same, more exam centres would be made. All examinees have also to wear masks compulsorily.
 It has been decided that all teachers and non-teaching staff would be given duties for exams and no one, barring some emergency cases, would be excused.
 AU authorities would also be sanitising all exam centres, as suggested by UGC. It has been decided that the question paper format would remain the same as half of the exams had already been conducted before the lockdown started.
 In another decision, it has been decided that viva voce exam of PhD and MPhil could be held in online mode. However, it has not been made mandatory. In another development, the admission committee at AU also held its meeting. The committee decided to restart the admission process for various undergraduate and postgraduate courses offered by AU and its constituent colleges.
 "It has been decided that for various UG and PG courses, aspirants can start submitting their applications through online mode from May 10", said AU PRO Shailendra Mishra.
 The last date of filling up of the applications has not been decided by the admission committee. The entrance exam will be held in August and the results would be announced in the same month.
 The admission process for UG and PG courses for academic session 2020- 21 had started on March 25 through online mode. However, it was stopped after first two days.

“It’s a moment of truth for the United Nations and the multilateral system which faces the most difficult crisis the U.N. has been confronted with since World War II," Kabtani said.
 The 193-member U.N. General Assembly approved two resolutions on COVID-19 in April.
 One recognizes “the unprecedented effects” of the pandemic and calls for “intensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat” the new coronavirus. The other urges global action to rapidly scale up development, manufacturing and access to medicine, vaccines and medical equipment to confront the pandemic.
 General Assembly resolutions reflect the opinion of governments around the world but are not legally binding. By contrast, Security Council resolutions are legally binding.
 U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who called for a cease-fire to all global conflicts on March 23 to tackle COVID-19, told reporters last Thursday: “It is my hope the Security Council will be able to find unity and adopt decisions that can help to make cease-fires meaningful and real.”
 The draft French-Tunisian resolution demands an immediate cease-fire in major conflicts that are on the Security Council agenda from Syria and Yemen to Libya, South Sudan and Congo, and calls for all parties to armed conflicts “to engage immediately in a durable humanitarian pause for at least 30 consecutive days” to deliver aid.
 The draft, obtained by The Associated Press, states that these measures do not apply to military operations against the Islamic State and al-Qaida extremist groups and their affiliates.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department says it will begin distributing billions in coronavirus relief funding to tribes. The announcement Tuesday comes more than a week after a congressional deadline to get $8 billion to tribal governments. Tribes sued to keep the funding from Alaska Native corporations, which own Native land but aren't tribal governments. The Treasury Department says tribes will receive a combined $4.8 billion based on population over the next several days and the rest will be doled out later. Tribes are relying on the money to stay afloat, respond to the coronavirus and recover after shutting down casinos, tourism operations and other businesses.

It's a lousy title - one that isn't explained till just before the end credits run - but it's not a bad movie. Neither, unfortunately, is much of a good movie. Even so, the target audience of female tweens and teens, as well as some slightly older young women, just might eat this up.
 The opening shot, a full-screen close-up on the face of Johanna Morrigan (Beanie Feldstein, from "Lady Bird" and "Booksmart") makes it clear that this is going to be a story about her ... about her insecurities, her dreams, her missteps, and eventually her redemption.
 It's 1993. She's 16, lives with her family in the British town of Wolverhampton, and is an overachiever at school, always writing long-winded essays, much to the consternation of her English teacher. But writing is her passion; the girl can't help it.
 She also has a regular practice of escaping from reality, and spends a great deal of time in her bedroom, having conversations, in a Harry Potter-like manner, with photos and paintings on her wall. And those folks on the wall - Sigmund Freud, Sylvia Plath, and Maria von Trapp among them - are ready to offer some advice, at least in Johanna's head.
 Though the family is close, there are money problems. Breeding border collies doesn't quite pay the bills. On top of that, mom (Sarah Solemani) has a touch of depression, and loose, laidback dad (Paddy Considine, terrific in the role), is a bit of a scoundrel, as well as being a frustrated ex-drummer who still wants to play in a pop band.
 Johanna's hopes are boosted when she hears of an opening to be a rock critic at the (fictional) London fanzine Disc and Music Echo, and even though her taste in music leans toward "Tomorrow" from "Annie," she catches a break, due in part to an assignment that no one at the magazine wants, and gets a gig covering a concert.
 But first, she decides to reinvent herself, physically changing her appearance and wardrobe from the relatively bland Johanna Morrigan to the glitzy, lipsticked, top-hatted Dolly Wilde. From that point on, every scene, and almost every moment of the movie, rests on the shoulders of Feldstein, who goes at it with a big dose of frenetic energy and a winning smile. Her dream is coming true, she lands more review assignments, and she tries for a step up the freelance ladder by asking to write a feature - and getting a yes.
 This leads to a third strong performance in the film - after those of Feldstein and Considine - and the introduction of pop star and singer of sad songs John Kite (Alfie Allen, Theon from "Game of Thrones"), who is to be her first interview subject (and it turns out that Allen is a very good singer!).
 Complications arise, the term "off the record" might not be quite clear to the novice interviewer, emotions veer out of control, things go badly, and a John Kite poster starts talking to her, attempting to help her out of the problems she inadvertently creates for herself. One of them involves the changes she finds herself going through. Her magazine wants tough stories, not fawning pieces, and Johanna plunges down a dark hole that results in new, not very pleasant personalities taking root in her. Her profiles and reviews turn nasty, her attitude toward her family becomes one of a jerk, she becomes recognized for her "toxic writing," and she's proud of it.
 She morphs into a protagonist that no one will be rooting for, not even that young target audience. Most of this works quite well in a dramatic sense. But some lazy writing late in the film leads to a lame plot twist that turns everything around too conveniently, with wrongs being righted too easily.
 For a brief moment, the film again finds its footing, with Alfie Allen's acting range saving the day, but then we get an unnecessary breaking of the fourth wall at the very end with a message delivered to anyone still interested - those young girls again - to be yourself. That lesson was already there, in the words of the characters. It sure didn't need to be given twice.
 "How to Build a Girl" premieres on VOD platforms on May 8.
