Sarita Koli and her mother have been selling fish at Lalbaug market all their lives, each bringing in Rs. 200 to Rs. 300 a day. Ever since the COVID-19 lockdown began, their entire family in Worli Koliwada is at home with no income. Her son Sunil is worried about the uncertainty. “We don’t even know if fishing will resume after the monsoon. If this goes on, some fisherfolk might commit suicide,” he says.
 Two cyclones ravaged the beginning of their season, followed by a slack winter, COVID-19, the economic slowdown. And now, with the approaching monsoon, Maharashtra’s fishermen stare at the loss of an entire year’s business.
 Even though fishing has been exempted from the lockdown, unions and marine research institute scientists estimate only about 30% to 40% fishing has taken place in the State.
 In Mumbai,koliwadas in Worli, Juhu and Khar are under the grip of COVID-19. As the monsoon approaches, fisherfolk are staring at a period of another three months of no income.
 ## Dry season
 The fishing year typically starts in August. In October 2019, Maharashtra’s fishermen could not venture into the sea due to Cyclone Kyarr and in November, due to Cyclone Maha. With the beginning of their season ruined, fishermen headed into the slack season of December and January when the catch diminishes due to the cold. They were hoping to salvage the year in the February to May period, when COVID-19 hit them harder than both these cyclones combined.
 “My family has been in the fishing business for generations and I have never seen such a year,” says Devendra Kale, member of Vesava Koli Nakhwa Machhimar Mandal. “In Versova, for every fishing boat, the owner has suffered losses of Rs. 15 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh this year.”
 In April, a month after the lockdown took effect, the Central government exempted the fishing and marine aquaculture industry, on condition that maintain physical distancing and hygiene norms.
 Soon after, the Maharashtra government issued rules for fishing activities wherein roadside stalls were banned but home delivery was allowed. Despite the order, little to no fishing has taken place off the coast of Maharashtra in April or May.
 Soon after the lockdown, social media was abuzz with images of fishermen dumping their catch back into the sea. Hundreds of fisherfolk remained stranded at sea after the lockdown and had to be brought back to safety. Once that happened, a majority of fisherfolk have not ventured into the sea, be it in Mumbai or anywhere in the rest of the State.
 Kiran Koli, secretary of the Maharashtra Machhimar Kruti Samiti (MMKS), pegged the losses at Rs. 1,000 crore in Mumbai alone. “Even though fishing has been exempted, where do we take the catch? The market, cold storage and export is shut,” said Mr. Koli.
 China, he said, imports 80% of the fish, and small fishermen have suffered the most as they live hand to mouth. “People have loans from fishermen’s societies and banks, why aren’t these being waived? If farmers are given aid after a failed season, why doesn’t anyone talk about fishermen? If this persists, fishermen might starve to death.”

In light of the worst public health crisis in generations, we have used medical science, facts and compassion as our guide. Throughout this crisis, our decision-making has been guided by Cherokee Nation health experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Based on this guidance, limiting access to government headquarters and temporarily shutting our businesses was the right thing to do.
 We are now ready to move forward, while continuing to err on the side of safety and being prepared for any sudden change. Beginning June 1, Cherokee Nation will begin a phased reopening of government offices, as well as Cherokee Nation Businesses. We will execute this plan gradually and strategically to safely restore services that have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Our plan incorporates social distancing with employees returning on staggered shifts.
 As we begin a return to normalcy, I am proud of our team’s response to the pandemic. Our government and business employees have risen to the challenge of this unprecedented time. Those not directly connected to our COVID-19 response have been working from home, taken voluntary furlough, or been on administrative leave since mid-March. These actions helped flatten the curve in northeastern Oklahoma, making it safer for everyone. Our employees have continued to receive pay and health benefits throughout this time, and that will not change as we execute our reopening plan.

For Oklahomans who have been pushing for an expansion of passenger rail in this state, last Wednesday's action by the House of Representatives might have come as somewhat of a shock. But it's a shock in a good way.
 The Legislature has its priorities, and with some notable exceptions among Republicans serving metropolitan areas, and Democrats in more rural pockets of the state, rail service hasn't been among them. This year, for example, concerns have focused on the collapsed fossil fuel market, which legislators stubbornly cling to as the state's prime source of revenue, by a long shot; diversification doesn't seem to be in their mental portfolio. The coronavirus has also laid waste to other tax avenues, and across-the-board cuts could be substantial for all agencies. Plus there's the 35 percent pay raise most legislators – again, with a few exceptions – plan to gleefully accept in November.
 Nevertheless, the House managed to unanimously adopt a resolution to support extension of passenger rail service from Oklahoma City to Newton, Kansas. That came in the form of House Resolution 1036, by Ken Luttrell, R-Ponca City; John Pfeiffer, R-Orlando; and Garry Mize, R-Guthrie. The resolution calls for a partnership between Amtrak and any states through which a line runs. Of course, the resolution sets aside no funding, but it does push for Oklahoma's congressional delegation to work to secure federal funding.
 Good luck with that, though. Even if the Legislature manages to get Oklahoma's bunch on board, it's doubtful that they can persuade self-serving types like Mitchell McConnell to their way of thinking. Why would these upper-echelon elites – who fly first class to their destinations of choice – care about a transportation mode that caters mainly to working and middle-class families?

 Asimismo, también estuvieron junto a Trump, el secretario de Salud, Alex Azar; el secretario del Tesoro, Steven Mnuchin, y los doctores Deborah Birx y Anthony Fauci, que lideran el grupo de trabajo de la Casa Blanca contra el virus.
 Trump reiteró que el origen del coronavirus estuvo en China y responsabilizó a ese país por no haber hecho más para frenar la expansión de la pandemia.
 No obstante, en un poco habitual gesto de cooperación internacional dado su agresivo nacionalismo, subrayó el esfuerzo global actualmente en marcha.
 "Estamos trabajando conjuntamente con diferentes países y, de nuevo, no tenemos ego, no tenemos ego. Quien lo logre, perfecto. Trabajaremos con ellos y ellos trabajaran con nosotros", dijo.
 Al ser preguntado si lo mismo ocurriría con China debido a las crecientes tensiones entre las dos grandes potenciales mundiales, el mandatario se mostró a favor.
 "Diría que la respuesta sería sí", respondió.
 CRISIS ECONÓMICA
 Estados Unidos sigue siendo el foco central de la pandemia, con más de 86.000 fallecidos y más de 1,4 millones de casos positivos por COVID-19.
 Además del terrible saldo mortal, el país encara una aguda crisis económica debido a la parálisis de la actividad económica, algo que ha generado choques en la Casa Blanca ante la insistencia de Trump por levantar las restricciones y los llamados de los expertos médicos a la prudencia.
 "La gente quiere regresar" a sus actividades, insistió, aunque reconoció que el regreso implicaría nuevas condiciones ante la amenaza persistente del virus.
 Más de la mitad de los estados de EE.UU. han iniciado la reapertura parcial de la economía y una retirada gradual de las restricciones de movilidad, pero todavía se enfrentan a los miedos de los ciudadanos que no consideran que el virus esté controlado.
 Los demócratas de la Cámara Baja han propuesto un nuevo plan de estímulo fiscal valorado en otros 3 billones de dólares, que incluye enviar a los estadounidenses una segunda ronda de cheques de estímulo, más generosa que la anterior, y que en algunos casos puede ascender a 6.000 dólares por familia.
 El plan se espera que sea aprobado que esta tarde en la Cámara de Representantes, dado que los demócratas, que la impulsan, tienen la mayoría, pero los republicanos, que controlan el Senado, y el propio Trump ya han mostrado su oposición, por lo que se quedará como elemento de negociación.
 "El nuevo programa de estímulo podría salir adelante, pero tendrá que ser del modo adecuado", sostuvo el mandatario en una nueva muestra de rechazo a la propuesta demócrata.
 El nuevo paquete contempla un billón de dólares para los Gobiernos estatales, locales y autoridades tribales, así como para el sistema sanitario, y establece un "Fondo de Héroes" de 200.000 millones de dólares para reforzar los salarios de los trabajadores esenciales.
 La gravedad del impacto del virus es de una de magnitud sin precedentes recientes, de acuerdo a los primeros indicadores macroeconómicos que se han ido conociendo.
 El primer cálculo de evolución del producto interior bruto (PIB) del primer trimestre del año registró una contracción del 4,8 %, pero se espera que las cifras del segundo trimestre sean mucho más dramáticas, y el desempleo en el país se disparó en abril hasta alcanzar una tasa del 14,7 %, cifra no vista desde hace 70 años, como consecuencia de la oleada de despidos.

Workers, the real India
 Though the travails of migrant workers have been highlighted by the media time and again, their status remains unenviable. They went through the extreme rigours of staying away from home and suffered in silence, having been deprived of livelihoods during the lockdown period. The inhuman treatment meted out to them such as spraying disinfectants on them like cattle cannot be erased from memory. The government needs to ensure that the free foodgrains scheme reaches bonafide beneficiaries — migrants who are still stationed in their work places. After all, they are the fulcrum of nation building, whose existential concerns should be addressed.
 P.K. Varadarajan,
 Chennai
 The announcements for migrant workers and small farmers in the stimulus package are short on complete succour, given the magnitude of the crisis. Many migrant workers have either reached their home towns or on their way home.
 They will be reluctant to go back to their workplaces out of fear of contracting infection and the great worry of an uncertain future.
 What they need badly need apart from food security is job security. Unfortunately, some States are taking extreme steps such as diluting labour laws. The workers should be treated as equal players to entrepreneurs in the running of the economy.
 Dr. D.V.G. Sankararao,
 Nellimarla, Andhra Pradesh
 The ongoing crisis regarding migrant labour serves as an eye-opener to all. Walking on their own on never-ending roads, with family and belongings, shows that the real India which once used to reside in villages, has now migrated to towns and cities elsewhere. Ironically, it is not COVID-19 patients, but the journey of migrant workers that has become the defining image of the novel coronavirus pandemic in India. The situation is powerful enough to shake our collective conscience — as a citizen and as a consumer of goods made with their labour.

Originally, we staffed a team of level designers to script the game events, believing the scripting burden was simply a matter of placing some triggers. We soon learned that to make the unique cinematic experiences come to life, much more scripting was required. It wasn't long before the level designers spent entire days bogged down in Lua. Though tech-savvy, they were not programmers. The code they generated was complex, buggy, and ultimately unusable. So, eight gameplay programmers were hired to rewrite the entire Lua side of the game from scratch. Staffed with experienced industry programmers and fresh college graduates from Computer Science departments, this group was one of our most critical (and overworked) ones, contributing profoundly to the design and quality of the game.

Kewanee Public Library will begin offering curbside pickups on Monday, May 18.
   
 Library Director Barbara Love said the library will be following state and health department guidelines.
   
 "The main thing in our planning is safety," she said. "We've planned each step with care to make sure the process is as safe as possible."
   
 Beginning Monday, patrons can call the library from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday to request library materials. Staff members will take requests and assign pickup times.
   
 At the assigned time, patrons will drive up in front of the library and call to let staff know they've arrived. Staff members wearing masks will bring the materials to the patrons' trunks. Patrons can make returns at the outdoor drop box, but items cannot be returned curbside.
   
 Love said that the library's staff had been working behind the scenes to make the new service possible. "Even though the library doors have been closed, library staff have been hard at work keeping up digital libraries and planning for how and when we can begin to open again," Love said. "We are excited to be able to begin to let people check out books again."
   
 The library has been a fine-free library since April1 and late fines are not being charged. In addition, all outstanding overdue fees have been cleared from library card records. Bills for items checked out and never returned are still being charged.
   
 Everyone is encouraged to return books and other items that are late. When the items are returned, library cards are cleared of charges and people can check out again. It is always preferred that items are returned so they can be enjoyed by others.
   
 Being closed during the health emergency has actually started the fine free era a little early because no fines have been charged during this time. All due dates were also extended during the shut-down.

DETROIT (AP) — Summer school remains up in the air for kindergarten through 12th graders across Michigan, but some districts are making tentative plans for sessions that take into account protections against the COVID-19 virus. More than 200 students have registered for summer school in suburban Detroit’s Novi Community Schools, The Detroit News reported Friday. The session is scheduled to start June 29. The Berkley School District north of Detroit sent a survey to parents asking if they are interested in summer school, whether they preferred online, in-person or a hybrid summer program, and whether they would pay for summer school. Districts still are under Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order closing school buildings for the current academic year that ends in June and have not yet been cleared to allow learning inside school buildings. Districts will need to build protocols to protect the health and safety of students, educators, administrators and support staff “in order to safely begin to plan for in-person instruction,” Whitmer spokesman Robert Leddy told the newspaper. Detroit Public Schools Community District Superintendent Nikolai Vitti says it’s important to start planning to open buildings for face-to-face summer school as soon as July — pending the lifting of the governor’s stay-at-home order and the ability to create safe conditions for students and staff. “We want to address this need in the safest way possible starting this summer,” Vitti said. “We can envision a hybrid of face-to-face instruction and online learning for both enrichment and credit/grades K-12.” Opening a set of schools in each section of the city with smaller class sizes to ensure social distancing measures could be considered. Classrooms would be cleaned...

The spring weather and the loosening of business restrictions have brought out the green-thumbers in droves.
   
 Jeff Johnson, owner of Sunnyfield Greenhouse and Garden Center in Galva, said last month's sales were up 30 percent over the previous year as a record- setting number of customers poured into his business the first weekend of May.
   
 "We're one of the few places open," Johnson said of the increase in business, and it's not just in the Kewanee area, but all across the country, he said.
   
 Johnson said he's already sold out of certain items, especially vegetable plants and some of his items on re-order are taking several weeks to come in.
   
 Hot items this year include not just vegetables but also small fruit plants. The increased interest in growing food at home could be a response to consumer worries and uncertainty about future food shortages amid the pandemic.
   
 The threat of COVID-19 hasn't been an issue for daily operations, said Johnson.
   
 "We have a lot of square footage," he said.
   
 That square footage made it easier for customers over the busy Mother's Day weekend to observe social distancing. Johnson's employees are also wearing face masks.
   
 The garden center is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and from 10 a.m. To 5 p.m. Sunday.
   
 At Kewanee's Dew Fresh Market, owner Paul Lamb said the increase in business has been incredible.
   
 "It's been a madhouse," Lamb said, noting his sales have doubled in recent weeks.
   
 "I think everyone is stuck at home anyway, and a lot of people have turned that into working on their house and yard," he said.
   
 Lamb said he's had customers from as far away as Iowa City, Bloomington and even Southern Wisconsin come in to purchase his inventory. And while he's seen his regular customers come through, he's also seen a lot of new faces.
   
 "A lot more than normal and a lot of new ones with questions," he said of the gardening novices.
   
 Lamb also said vegetable plants are flying off the shelves.
   
 "We've had a heck of time keeping up with them," he said.
   
 But Lamb said as far as inventory, the nursery is solid and the next crop of vegetables are on their way.
   
 "I think people will plant into June and the better part of mid-June," he said.
   
 Dew Fresh is in its 31st year of operations and is open 8 to 5, seven days a week.
   
 At least one area nursery hasn't yet opened its doors for customers and has no immediate plans to do so.
   
 Ryan Werkheiser, owner of Kewanee's Nature's Creations Greenhouse & Farm, has no plans to open up his family farm to customers. Instead, the farm is offering curbside pickup to customers, who can place orders either through the business Facebook page or by email.
   
 But even with curbside pickup, Werkheiser said he's seen an increase in sales.
   
 "I'm surprised at the amount of business I'm getting from curbside," he said.
   
 And while vegetables have been a hot commodity, he said he's selling a wide variety of other plants and flowers as well. Already, he's looking towards the future and hopes he will be able to open his greenhouse to foot traffic by autumn.. In September, the business re-opens to sell 180 varieties of pumpkins and gourds, mums and popcorn.
   
 "I hope things get back to normal before fall and we can feel comfortable opening back up to the public," he said.

Saturday’s 11-race card has an average of 11 entries per race, and all but one of Sunday’s 11 races is overbooked – 103 trainers have entered horses and 49 jockeys are scheduled to ride.
 “We understand a lot of people are suffering through this pandemic, and we wanted to make sure if we reopened, as other businesses do, that we do it in the best possible light,” Churchill Downs president Kevin Flannery said. “. . . It’s been a roller-coaster of emotions for everyone. Not just here but for the entire community and nation. We feel a big sense of responsibility for people who make their money in this industry. We wanted to do things right and be responsible. And we wanted to give people hope. That’s really what it is all about. So I’m excited we’re here and excited to start racing.”
 Churchill had to put together its purse structure without money from its Churchill Downs gaming operation, which has been shut down by COVID-19 restrictions. And on-track revenue will be a while coming. But if betting handles at other tracks that have remained open through the shutdowns is any indication, bettors will be active though Churchill's TwinSpires.com online platform.
 “Not a lot is going on. I think folks are starved for content,” Flannery said. “I think this is an opportunity for those who love the game to be involved, and maybe to introduce some new fans to this great sport, and the beauty and competition of it.”
 Jockey Gabriel Saez described the emotions of many this week when he said, “I never realized how much I missed Churchill. The track feels great and I’m so happy to be back home. It’s going to be a good meet. It’ll be competitive but I’m ready to go.”
 Competitive might be an understatement. Amoss is just seven wins away from matching Dale Romans for Churchill’s all-time lead in wins at the track, but he said wins will be harder to come by with more horses – and more talent – in the fields.
 “There are a lot of really good trainers here,” he said. “From the standpoint of handicapping, they’re going to be great. Big fields, a lot of opportunities to take advantage of nice odds. From a trainer’s point of view, you’re not going to win as often as you used to. Mathematically, running in 12-horse fields, you’re not going to win as often as you would in 7-8-horse fields. It’s great for the handicappers and betting and handle. But from a trainer’s perspective, it’s going to be a lot harder to win races.”
 And, of course, it is different without fans. Amoss, who will double as an analyst for Fox Sports for much of the meet, says the absence of fans could lead to horses running truer to form, without that distraction. But he also says it’s strange. His Serengeti Empress, last year’s Kentucky Oaks winner, won the Azari Stakes at Oaklawn with no fans in the stands, and though Amoss said he was happy, it was a different feeling.
 “Oaklawn is a track that draws big crowds,” Amoss said. “Smart racing people just like here at Churchill Downs, and to have no one there to witness it, I’m not going to call it a disappointment because it was a great win, but certainly took away from her performance.”
 Brad Cox is no stranger to big wins. He’ll saddle an Oaks winner, Monomoy Girl, in a comeback attempt in Saturday’s fourth race. But he said racing without fans took some getting used to.
 “My first experience was at Fair Grounds on Louisiana Derby day, and it was a great experience because we won the Louisiana Derby, but it was odd, to say the least,” Cox said. “It was an eerie feeling to win a big race and nobody be around. It’s definitely not good for the game.”
 But it’s how the game will have to live for a while. And everyone involved is grateful for that opportunity.
 “It’s so unusual,” Flannery said. “But it’s that first step. We’re excited to be on FoxSports1 this weekend, and it’s going to be incredible racing. … This is that first step to say we’re going to be OK now.”

LAUREL, Md. (AP) — Billions of dollars worth of fruit, vegetables and other farm products that might have gone to waste because of the coronavirus pandemic will instead be delivered to food banks and nonprofit organizations that help the needy under a new Agriculture Department program.Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and White House adviser Ivanka Trump on Friday toured a Maryland food service distributor that’s participating in the Farmers to Families Food Box Program.At a brief ceremony marking the program's launch at Coastal Sunbelt Produce in Laurel, Perdue gave credit to President Donald Trump. Trump had seen news reports about farm goods going to waste and said ‘Sonny, I want you to bring me a program that will work,’"Perdue said.Perdue announced last month that his department will spend up to $3 billion in coronavirus relief money to buy and distribute agricultural goods through regional and local distributors.“When this thing happened, obviously, it was horrifying to hear about vegetables having to be plowed under because of no markets and milk having to be dumped, animals potentially having to be euthanized because we had broken the supply chain,” Perdue said.Food distributors saw sharp declines in business after restaurants and other food service establishments shut down or cut back because of the pandemic.Suppliers, like Coastal Sunbelt Produce, are packaging the fruits and vegetables in family-sized cardboard boxes and expects to deliver 35,000 boxes a week to food banks, community and religious organizations, and other nonprofits through June 30.Perdue, Ivanka Trump and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who wore face coverings inside the refrigerated warehouse, watched as workers swiftly packed boxes with mushrooms, tomatoes, zucchini, bell peppers, potatoes and other produce items. The workers were bundled up against the chill and wore face shields, face masks and other protective gear.“We held them,” Ivanka Trump said. “These are 20 to 25 pound boxes of the finest fresh produce, often locally grown.”The president's eldest daughter has been working with USDA, the Small Business Administration and Treasury Department to include smaller farms in coronavirus relief programs, the White House said.After Coastal Sunbelt Produce received a USDA contract, the company was able to recall 50 furloughed employees to work on the food box program, she said.Trump praised the program at an unrelated White House event on Friday.“It’ll be helping farmers, ranchers, but it’ll be bringing food to some of the food lines and some of the food kitchens that you’ve been seeing on television,” he said.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Out of adversity often comes innovation.  
 As fire departments continue to battle coronavirus, Cuyahoga Falls firefighters are channeling their inner MacGyver and building devices to do extra decontamination.  
 "This is an unseen enemy," Falls Fire Lt. Rick Malak said. "You have to be hyper vigilant about everything."  
 Assistant Chief Chris Martin said the department started ordering masks, gowns, gloves and other necessary protective gear to stockpile in preparation for coronavirus. It also started adding extra cleaning and decontamination to its arsenal.  
 Like protective equipment, medical cleaning equipment was on back order. As they waited for items to become available, firefighters started seeing what they could make on their own.  
 "Most of the guys in the fire department have some mechanical intuition, " Lt. Tom Carano said. "We all like to tinker."  
 Tinker away they did, and now the department has a wide array of UV-light based units, both bought and built, to decontaminate rooms and items.  
 Carano said they're using the UV lights in addition to their normal decontamination protocols. UV light is not clinically proven to kill coronavirus yet but has been shown to kill most other viruses. Similar devices are used in hospitals to sanitize rooms, and smaller devices are available commercially to clean smaller objects, although they have been hard to buy recently.  
 "In light of the virus, every little thing we can do extra makes our city that much safer," he said.  
 The science behind UV light, Carano said, is that it stops cellular replication, killing viruses and bacteria with prolonged exposure. UV-light is what gives people sunburns, but a lot more of it is needed for decontamination, so the department uses special light bulbs.  
 To clean the backs of ambulances and rooms in the fire station, Carano wired a timer into five floor lamps, and outfitted them with UV-light bulbs. The lamps are left to run for about half an hour and can cover up to 500 square feet of space.  
 The same bulbs can go into the decontamination boxes Carano made to use for smaller items, including firefighters' masks, tablets they use on the job or even their cell phones. The rubber containers, lined with reflective material, have hooks on their lids so masks can be dangled in front of the light and hit on all sides.  
 The department bought small containers that look almost like lunch boxes that do the same thing.  
 Carano said they also bought a lamp designed for decontamination. The medical lamp cost about $1,000, and it broke the next day. Carano made five lamps for about half the cost.  
 Using UV light also avoids having to use chemicals. N95-masks, for instance, can be damaged if they're cleaned with some chemicals. Carano said the masks use a static charge, which attracts particles like a magnet. Using a chemical solution could remove that charge.  
 Every patient gets a new mask they keep. The N-95 masks firefighters use are in high-demand, and the UV light can give them a way to clean them in between calls, Carano said.  
 "Right now, they're in short supply, so we're doing everything we can to make them last longer." Carano said.  
 Staying clean isn't just important for patients, it's also important for paramedics themselves. Malak said in many cases, they're face-to-face with people who may have or are confirmed to have coronavirus when they respond in an ambulance.  
 "We have to sit within a couple of feet of the patient for the entire trip," Malak said.  
 To help mitigate risk, Malak built onto the existing exhaust systems in each ambulance and created a way to expel air from patients out the door, instead of toward paramedics. Using plumbing parts and shop-vac tubes, he said it's a cheap way to keep the firefighters safe and healthy.  
 "In effect, they're not exhaling in the back of the ambulance," Malak said.  
 For added decontamination, the department also purchased a "disinfectant bomb" that will fog the back of the ambulances with a cleaning solution. The bomb is used every few weeks in addition to germ-killing wipes used after each call.  
 Martin said the increased decontamination, both purchased and made in-house, has been an ongoing effort as the department stays prepared for the coronavirus. Some of the items, like the disinfectant bomb, will be used for years to come, and the next ambulance coming to the department already has UV lights built in.  
 Staying ahead of the virus hasn't come cheap. Fire Chief Fred Jackson said the department has spent tens of thousands of dollars more than it normally would.  
 The need for more protective equipment and rising prices for the items have contributed to the increased spending, he said.  
 When Ebola hit the country, Jackson said the department learned to be prepared. It has some supplies stockpiled from then, and will stockpile any back-ordered supplies they order now but get later.  
 At their current rate of use, Martin said they'll have enough personal protective equipment for the current wave of coronavirus cases. As the supplies they ordered come in, they can stock up and prepare for potential second or third waves. He said the only true marker that the crisis is over is when the vaccine is available..  
 "We've gotten through the sprint, now we're in the marathon," Martin said. "We still need to be as far ahead of this as we can."

It’s a big accomplishment for such a young racing series, especially as other major motorsports have struggled to draw in new fans and have had difficulty retaining existing ones. But it’s not something that arrived out of the blue. Formula E is backed by a consortium of big investors (including Liberty Media and Discovery Communications), and it signed a 10-year deal with Saudi Arabia to perform races there. It has now mostly trimmed its losses each season as the series switched its main source of funding from capital investment to sponsorships and race revenue.

Republicans in the Illinois General Assembly said Thursday that when lawmakers return to the Capitol next week, they intend to push for changes to Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s plan for reopening the economy, a plan he dubbed “Restore Illinois.”
 “I have heard members from both caucuses suggest this plan should be vetted and revised,” Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady, of Bloomington, said in a letter to Senate President Don Harmon (D-Oak Park) that he released to the media. “I also believe this should be done in a public setting, which can be undertaken using available technology and social-distancing protocols when we convene in Springfield.”
 Pritzker’s plan divides the state into four broad regions and allows for the gradual reopening of businesses and public activities in five phases if they meet and sustain certain benchmarks for infection rates and hospital capacity over a 28-day period. The final, full reopening phase would occur only after a COVID-19 vaccine or treatment is widely available, something that could take one year or more.
 As of May 1, all of Illinois was in the second phase of that plan, which allows nonessential retail stores to accept online and telephone orders for pick-up or delivery. It also allows hospitals to resume performing elective surgeries and procedures.
 According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, as of Thursday, all four regions of the state, including the northeast region that includes Chicago and Cook County, were on course to move into Phase 3 of the plan by May 29 – the earliest date any region could enter the next phase.
 In that phase, manufacturing, offices, retail establishments, barbershops and salons would be able to reopen to the public, with mandatory capacity limits and other safety precautions. Gatherings of 10 or fewer people will be allowed, although face coverings and social-distancing requirements will remain in place.
 Only in Phase 4 would restaurants and bars be allowed to reopen with capacity limits. Childcare and schools could resume operations under IDPH guidelines, nonessential travel would be allowed and public gatherings of up to 50 people would be permitted.
 But during a video news conference Thursday, a group of House Republicans argued that Pritzker’s plan is still too restrictive and that progress toward a full reopening is too slow.
 “One of the problems I have going from 3 to 4 is, when you open up the businesses in 3, you have no childcare for them,” said Rep. Mike Murphy, a Springfield Republican. “I think this whole plan needs to be reevaluated. I don't see how these businesses can open up in Phase 3 without viable childcare. I also question why restaurants, once again, are part of Phase 4 where in many other states, they're already opening. We have over 30 counties that border states with restaurants open right now.”
