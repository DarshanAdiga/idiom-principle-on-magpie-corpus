Haslem spent just the one year in France, lost about 50 pounds when he was there, fought his way into a tryout with the Heat and the Miami native has been with his hometown NBA team ever since. Corey Crowder remembers times during practice with the French club when Haslem would get put on the second team to face the rest of the starters, "and he'd beat us by himself," Corey Crowder said.

Comparing Trump, Biden:


  “She hit the nail on the head! The comparisons of Biden versus Trump — good versus evil — every single comparison was spot on! How anyone can justify support for Trump is beyond me. I hope and pray Joe Biden wins and brings back civility to the highest office in the land.”

“People don’t realize,” Marks said, of the scope of pandemic relief provided by the tribe. “Sometimes our people don’t realize how much we’re doing in all of this. But it really adds up in the long run.”
 ## Array of quarantine solutions
 Like many other tribes in the region, the Yankton Sioux Tribe has worked to build out some sort of quarantine option for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have had contact with those who have tested positive.
 Those isolation offerings have included providing backyard tents for those in sometimes crowded living situations, to refitting a wing of the tribe’s casino, temporarily shuttered due to the pandemic.
 Scott Davis, executive director of the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission, said he knows of several tribes across the state who are taking a similar approach, to answer a tough question: What happens if uncle gets sick?
 “Keep in mind, housing in the country, there’s three or four families living in one household, that’s very common,” Davis said. “So if you get the uncle who gets (COVID-19) -- boy, that’s what we’re talking about.”
 The Spirit Lake Tribe has worked to arrange quarantine housing at a local hotel, and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is working to place recreational vehicles on powwow grounds to serve as a quarantine center for tribe members, said Davis, who is a member of the tribe as well as a descendent of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.
 “Whether it’s a school gymnasium, or there in the casino or a local hotel, the tribes have worked very hard in being innovative and making sure the right people are quarantined away from those houses,” Davis said.

Do The Right Thing a été réalisé pour 6 millions de dollars et a rapporté près de 40 millions de dollars au box-office. Le film a également valu à Spike Lee sa toute première nomination aux Oscars (en 1990) pour l’écriture. Cependant, mis à part une nomination en 1998 pour un documentaire), il lui faudrait beaucoup de temps avant d’être à nouveau reconnu aux Oscars … Et c’était une pomme de discorde majeure pour lui.

 # Letter: Open letter to Sen. Braun
 Evansville Courier & Press
 Sen. Braun, dumb losers and suckers like me, who served in wars to protect our American political process, are confused on something. Why is the Trump SCOTUS nomination different from Obama's 2015 SCOTUS nomination?
 In 2015, the GOP Senate lockstepped to deny the American people an up or down Senate vote on Obama's very well-vetted and squeaky clean nominee. You told us that with just over a year to go until the 2016 election, the Senate had a duty to delay the SCOTUS process until after the presidential election was determined.
 Now, with only fifty days remaining until the 2020 presidential election, another seat on the SCOTUS is open, and you GOP Senators have done a 180. Now the GOP Senate is lockstepped saying you have a duty to rush a nominee through in just those few days.
 That unprecedented speed would mean no proper vetting, so the lifetime appointment could well produce another tainted justice like Brett Kavanaugh.
 I'm positive you have some explanation, some reason for this, that doesn't reflect badly on you ethically or morally. I just can't put my finger on it. Help out this old soldier, Sen Braun. Explain to me, where is the dignity, honor and patriotism in what you are doing?
