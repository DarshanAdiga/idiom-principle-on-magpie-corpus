“We joined the Supervalu Food Academy programme and applied for an expansion grant with Donegal Local Enterprise Office. With the help of grant aid, we upgraded our juicery last September by installing a commercial cold pressed juicer; this allowed us to increase our stockists to 150 stores nationwide. Naturally, this pandemic has been tough, as we had several other contracts secured that have been shelved for now, but I really believe the increase in business that we achieved in 2019 with the help of our Local Enterprise Office has left us in a very good position to continue producing. When the situation allows, we are determined to pick up where we left off and continue growing our team and the business” he said.

"But if it's interfering with being able to hear what's being said on the House floor, if I complain I'm going to ask them to ask the guy to please step outside and protest out there at that level, or tone it down. If you refuse, you're subject to being arrested and charged with disturbing the peace. It doesn't matter who it is."

Based in Kilcar, Donegal Farmhouse Cheese was set up in November 2018 by James and Noreen Cunningham: “We have a small farm of cattle and sheep and wanted to diversify the farm and add value in different ways,” Noreen said. “Using traditional techniques, and with the help of Local Enterprise Office Donegal and Teagasc, we started producing our handmade Kilard cheddar; a semi-hard cheese produced annually from May to September when the cows are grazing. Kilard Cheddar is handmade from pasteurised cow’s milk, contains no artificial flavours, colours or preservatives and is suitable for vegetarians. The fresh summer grass on the Donegal shores gives our cheese a distinctive flavour reflecting all that is unique about the Donegal countryside. Working with Local Enterprise Office Donegal helped us improve the efficiency of our cheese-making process with a Priming Grant and the COVID -19 support for the new website will help us reach new customers with our online shop, which went live this week” Noreen added.

If other giant companies follow suit, tech employment could start to shift away from expensive hubs like Silicon Valley, Seattle and New York. The option to work from home could also provide more reason for tech workers who complain that their enviable salaries still aren’t enough to buy a home in San Francisco or San Jose to consider settling in other parts of the country.
 Zuckerberg’s announcement followed similar decisions at Twitter and the payments company Square, both led by Jack Dorsey. Dorsey said last week that employees at his companies would be allowed to work from home indefinitely. At Google, employees have been told they can work from home through the end of the year, but the company has not made any indications about permanent plans.
 There are signs that remote work is popular among technologists. After Dorsey’s announcement, Google searches for “Twitter jobs” spiked, according to Google Trends.

Retail establishments, office spaces and restaurants gradually began reopening in May as Gov. Doug Ducey loosened various emergency regulations and allowed his stay-at-home order to expire on May 15.
 But the commutes and checkout lines still aren’t as full as they once were. This may be because—according to a recent Reuters survey—40 percent of Americans are still waiting to see how the virus and vaccine develops before they decide to continue their lives as before. With so much still up in the air, new laws are helping the local workforce decide the best plan of action.
 According to Jessica Post, head of the labor and employment practice group for Fennemore Craig law firm, there are two new laws Arizona workers should know about when returning to work: the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act and the Emergency Family Medical Leave Act. These are aimed at maintaining a safer working environment and clearing hurdles for returning to work.

WHEN approached to share his experiences as a volunteer in acknowledgment of National Volunteer Week (May 18-24), Alan O’Callaghan was hesitant.
 “I’ve always had a dilemma about promoting the link between people with disabilities and volunteering as if it’s their only work option,” Alan said matter-of-factly.
 “Before moving from Melbourne, I had paid employment for about 15 years along with two university diplomas. In Queensland, my experience and qualifications meant nothing.”
 Alan is a man of many facets – husband, father, retired public servant and a long-time advocate for people with disabilities. He also has cerebral palsy.
 He serves as the committee secretary for 121 Care and president for the Mooloolah Valley Community Association to which he volunteers not only his time, but also his skills, knowledge and experience as a community worker.
 “My involvement in the management of organisations now is not primarily about volunteering as it is about advocating,” he said.
 “On the committee of 121 Care, it’s about service consumers having a voice in the way services are focused on their choices. For many years, disability agencies were more concerned about services they provided and the medical model of disability, which I fear is creeping back in the with advent of NDIS. In services like that, people with disabilities (PWDs) had no choice in how they received services.”
 The busy septuagenarian has not only continued his advocacy for PWDs in retirement, but also ensuring that his community in Mooloolah continues to thrive.
 “As president of Mooloolah Valley Community Association, it’s about ensuring we obtain and provide benefits for our local community (and) the reason I involve myself in such activities is more about the politics than occupying my time as a volunteer,” he said.
 It was through decades of activism by pioneers such as Alan that led to the eventual establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
 “In the late ’70s, a friend encouraged me to become involved in the Disabled Action Forum which led to the establishment of the Disability Resources Centre,” he said.
 During the 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons, as a member of the inaugural Committee of the DRC, Alan began lobbying for in-home support for people with disabilities. The same year, he was also involved in organising a Super March where 3000 PWDs took their concerns through the Melbourne CBD.
 “Ironically, it was my advocacy and activism that led to my first paid employment (and) the jobs I had over the years had a strong advocacy component,” he said.
 Alan worked in the adult education sector supporting students with disabilities then later in local government for 10 years as access and integration officer advising on disability issues, policy, training and service gaps.
 “I have spent most of my life lobbying for in-home support and independent living for people with disabilities (and) my main aim was to put an end to institutionalisation and segregation for PWDs” he said.
 With the NDIS scheme now up and running, all that work has almost paid off.
 “Unfortunately, those of us who lobbied so long for such a program have been excluded due to the age limit imposed on entry to NDIS,” he said
 Alan and his family relocated to the Sunshine Coast from Melbourne at the turn of the millennium for his health. In trying to find work here, Alan came across Quality Lifestyle Alliance, the forerunner of 121 Care. His life and work proves advocacy in volunteerism can and does bring about change for the better.

Yes, some minor DC films like _Birds of Prey_ and _Shazam!_ didn’t perform quite as well at the box office—but even Marvel had some duds in the beginning. And the DCEU is very much in the beginning stages with its universe-building. The MCU has churned out 23 films since 2008, including nine over the past three years. Meanwhile, the DCEU only has eight films under its belt, with an average of about one per year. So this isn’t rock bottom for the DCEU—this is a jumping off point.
