It is becoming a standing joke that the ex-Liverpool legend Michael Owen is not a big Arsenal fan, and regularly tips us to get beaten (sadly he has been right quite a few times in the last few years), but for our last game of the season, against lowly Watford, he does actually think the Gunners will win the game to end the season on a high.
 “Arsenal were hugely disappointing in their 1-0 loss to Aston Villa on Tuesday night and, with qualification to the Europa League via the Premier League no longer an option, their minds will undoubtedly be on the FA Cup final to come,” Owen said in his blog at BetVictor.
 “Watford surprisingly sacked Nigel Pearson as their manager after their 3-1 defeat away at West Ham on Friday and were then walloped by Manchester City in their next game. That ruined their goal difference advantage over their relegation rivals and dropped them back into the relegation zone.
 “Suddenly, things look very bleak indeed for the Hornets, and a win is the least they look likely to need if they are to stand any chance of surviving the drop.
 “I expect to see a much-improved performance from Arsenal in this one and I’m going for a 2-1 win to Mikel Arteta’s men which will bring an end to Watford’s five year stay in the Premier League.”
 To be fair, it’s not such a hard call, with Watford having sacked their manager as they plummeted down the table, and the Hornets only scoring in one of their last six games against Arsenal. Of course the Aston Villa defeat was away from home, whereas our form at the Emirates has been far, far better with 8 games undefeated since the New Year (6W 2D), compared to Watford’s 8 games without winning away from home (7L 1D).
 On paper, this should be a doddle for Arsenal, but this game will be played on grass!

 “We welcome the Government’s introduction of ‘exemption cards’, but more must be done to raise public awareness of who is exempt from wearing face coverings, so the public are on board and disabled people feel supported.”

In the wake of business closures and job losses in the Philippines, thousands of Filipinos have found themselves struggling to make ends meet.

 The boy's parents recalled how once, when Benjamin saw a food peddler riding a beat-up bicycle with its pedals missing, he used his own savings to replace them. And they saw a way to connect their private donors with the needy in a way that echoed their son's good deed.
 The idea was to give away bikes to deserving individuals nominated by their peers or loved ones. Unsure of the demand, the foundation at first announced on social media that it would give away just seven bicycles. But there were more than 50 entries.
 The nominations were vetted for authenticity and on July 11, 27 individuals got bicycles that would help make their lives a little less difficult.
 Among the recipients was 25-year old Ronaldo del Rosario Jr. who lost his job at a fast food chain due to the lockdown. He ended up borrowing a bicycle to sell rice cakes in the morning and smoked fish in the afternoon, to support his wife and almost 2-month old baby. He traveled tens of kilometers each day. Often, precious time and income would be lost when his borrowed bike needed repairs.
 "I nominated him because he's so hard working that his (bicycle) wheels always end up breaking down," said Mharygrace Ortega, del Rosario's partner.

Jam session is an opinion forum offering comments on issues from a group of Plymouth residents. It appears on the Forum pages in the Weekend edition of the OCM.
 The newspaper poses a question to the group each week, and participants choose whether to comment. This column is designed to bring the voices of well- informed residents into the Forum page to address issues, one at a time.
 Participants cross the local political spectrum and live throughout the town. Some are current or past Town Meeting representatives, and all are active in the community. We hope their diverse points of view will encourage discussion of the issues Plymouth faces.
 This week's question  
 White Horse Beach - will the problems ever be contained? Plymouth Police will upgrade patrols and ticketing and towing to better enforce parking issues. Also, behavior on the beach is a continuing issue. As a member of the WHB Parking Committee said, "We've never had it as bad as it has been this year. We need help and we need it now." Are the latest measures enough to help the neighborhood? What would you suggest be done to alleviate the ongoing situation?
 Pat Adelmann
 Limiting parking to residents with beach stickers and increasing police presence will alleviate some of the problems at White Horse Beach. The well behaved nonresident families will no longer have the right to enjoy the beach. White Horse Beach is a poorly planned neighborhood. The public beach has inadequate sanitary and parking facilities. The proliferation of short term rentals and multiunit housing has contributed to the crowding on the beach.
 My coworker's neighborhood beach association in Dennis, hires a police detail to keep order from the encroaching public beachgoers.
 My fear is that the few visitors who have displayed unruly behavior have triggered an anti-outsiders sentiment. The White Horse Beach nonresident policy sets precedence for more restrictions to our beautiful natural resources.
 Pat Adelmann has been a Plymouth resident since 1977 and is a mother of five Plymouth Public School graduates, a proud grandmother of 12, a former School Committee member and a former Town Meeting representative.
 Ed Angley
 I believe it will. I have great confidence in the Chief and the Department. Aggressive enforcement of parking, trespass, etc., will set a tone and finally bring order to WH beach.

 Karen Buechs
 White Horse Beach residents are seeing more people on the beach is because of the lock-down. People need recreation and it seems they've chosen White Horse Beach. Of course, we all expect visitors to act appropriately. I see the Police Department doing all they can. Perhaps stiff fines could be applied. Tickets with a very high dollar amount. Outside of privatizing the entire beach (which I'm against) just hold on. Fall and Winter will be here soon enough.
 Karen Buechs was a Town Meeting representative and served as chair of Precinct 7. She sat on the Manomet Steering Committee, Manomet Village Common Inc., Capital Outlay Committee and the Revenue Idea Task Force. She also served as Charter Commission member and on three Charter Review Committees. Karen has been a resident of Plymouth for 46 years.
 Birgitta Kuehn
 Think of all the busy, beautiful beaches around the world and you'll find amenities that attract the beach-goers you envision. Some subtle, some not. Everyone knows that beaches have reputations. Long range strategic planning is needed for White Horse Beach. What is the Town's vision for Manomet beaches? Establish the goal, develop specific tactics to reach the goal and most importantly, attach a timeframe to each tactic. If the goal is to have a family beach three basics tactics need to happen to reach this goal, 1) one or even two family bathrooms with changing stations and showers are needed; 2) one or two designated and monitored parking areas need to be carved out through acquisition and 3) the safety of the water from Cyanobacteria in the stream and sharks off shore need to be secured (such as an Atlantic White Shark Conservancy partnership). Analyzing the factors contributing to the "current state" by engaging professional consultation and doing the work to implement a plan is politically difficult. The Bartlett Pond Watershed study was completed and the regulatory followup never implemented - it sits on the shelf with the others. The issues at White Horse beach are a result of the political will that has been infused in the area over the years - not to be confused with local passion. And no amount of "enforcement" will get White Horse Beach out from under its reputation without a strategic plan and strong leadership to implement the plan.

She is the former chairwoman of the Board of Health and serves as alternate to the Planning Board, and Town Meeting Rep for Precinct 15. Her commitment to volunteering spans local conservation and environmental groups, PACTV "The Plymouth Show" and the League of Women Voters.
 Mike Landers
 I haven't been to White Horse Beach for years. I found it overcrowded with no parking or bathrooms and decided that it was not very accommodating, even to residents. I know that there have been some improvements, but it appears that the improvements have fallen short of the need. I applaud all of the efforts and the enforcement by police and parking professionals. I'm very concerned about the lack of social distancing, lack of parking, bathrooms, etc. I wonder if the beach should be limited to Plymouth Residents only..
 Mike Landers is a Town Meeting representative and is the founder and producer of Project Arts of Plymouth. He is also the owner of Nightlife Music Company and is a performing musician.
 David Peck
 Aggressive, visible, prompt enforcement is needed...but only after signage (and lots of it) in place. You don't want any of the bad actors to claim they never saw the signs. And then, noisy, visible towing. And noisy, visible arresting of obvious misbehaving individuals, although that is a little tougher as the police probably would be issuing a warning first. If they still act up after a warning, handcuff them and walk them the length of the beach. The heavy enforcement message is for the offenders but even more so for the word of mouth/Facebook posts which will the multiply the message across the region. If you come to White Horse Beach, you must obey all the parking restrictions and be respectful of everyone sharing the beach, or there will be consequences. That said, White Horse is a public beach, and as much as the residents might want to" "privatize" it, we must keep it open.
 David Peck is the retired director of Facility Planning at Boston Children's Hospital. He serves as the chairman of the Plymouth Building Committee and vice-chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals. He is a Town Meeting representative from Precinct 4.
 Ed Russell
 White Horse Beach has always had parking issues and problems with some bad visitor behavior. It has only gotten worse as people that have been Covid secluded swarm out to find summer respite. It's happening all over New England; too many people going to too few beaches. Many beaches are being closed to non-residents and others are turning away crowds. You can't blame people for wanting to get away during Covid but there comes a point when it becomes too much and the throngs from out of town displace our own Plymouth residents. Something must be done. Ten years ago the town had to step in to quell July 3 bad behavior that have been escalating over the years. While I didn't experience what was happening at WHB this year I have seen things at their worst when Town action was required. In 2009 I was at Jordan Hospital's ER on July 3 when legions of drunken and injured WHB partiers rolled in one after the other all night long. Each case was sadly fascinating to behold. The next year brought Plymouth police oversight and WHB became family oriented again. 2020 is a tough time for the town to take on additional expenses but in this case it's warranted. The WHB community and the town will work out parking restrictions which I believe will return a sense of order once again.
 Ed Russell is an attorney and a Precinct 12 Town Meeting representative, and he serves on a number of town committees.
 Roger Silva
 The White Horse Beach problems were similar 40 years ago and ever since. Many resolve themselves as trouble spots were closed like the Full Sail and White Sands, but I think the leniency of bonfires on the 4th didn't help the problem! It will take a full and difficult response from the PD.

Driven by investments in liquid schemes as also banking and PSU funds, debt mutual funds saw an inflow of Rs 1.1 lakh crore in three months ended June 2020 after witnessing massive redemptions in the preceding quarter.
 Most individual categories that invest in fixed-income securities, or debt funds, saw inflows. However, credit risk, overnight, ultra-short duration, medium duration and dynamic bond funds saw withdrawals.
 The positive inflow pushed the asset base of debt mutual funds to Rs 11.63 lakh crore at June-end from Rs 11.5 lakh crore at the end of March, according to data with Association of Mutual Funds on India (Amfi).
 As per the data, inflows into debt mutual funds were at Rs 1.1 lakh crore in the three months ended June, compared to outflows of Rs 1.13 lakh crore in the January-March quarter.
 Investment into such funds was at Rs 19,690 crore during the quarter ended June 2019.
 Nearly 80 per cent of the total inflows during the quarter under review in the fixed-income segment came through liquid funds, where most of the institutional money is parked.
 Liquid funds, with investments in cash assets such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial paper for the shorter horizon, witnessed inflows amounting to Rs 86,493 crore during the quarter under review. The segment had witnessed an outflow of Rs 94,180 crore in the March quarter, typically due to advance tax payment requirements.
 In addition, banking and PSU category, which is considered as a safe option, received inflows of Rs 20,912 crore in the quarter ended June 2020, compared to a withdrawal of Rs 66 crore in the previous three months.
 As a mandate, such funds need to invest a minimum of 80 per cent of their total assets in debt instruments of banks, public sector undertakings, or public financial institutions. This makes the category of investment relatively safer than some of the other fixed-income categories in terms of credit risk.
 Further, investors poured in Rs 18,738 crore in corporate bonds.
 However, credit risk funds, which invest 65 per cent of the investment corpus in less than AA-rated paper, saw an outflow to the tune of Rs 25,905 crore.
 Such funds witnessed a pull out of Rs 19,239 crore in April, Rs 5,173 crore in May and Rs 1,494 crore in June.
 Huge outflow in April was mainly due to redemption pressure and lack of liquidity issues. Moreover, shutdown of six debt schemes by Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund added to the woes.
 Given the recent credit crisis that adversely impacted fixed-income markets, investors continue to tread a line of caution by staying away from riskier investments. Hence categories such as credit risk and medium duration, which also comprise funds that take credit bets, continue to witness net outflow, said Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director  Manager Research, Morningstar India.
 On the other hand, funds that do not cut corners with credit risk, especially from categories such as money market, short duration, corporate bond and banking and PSU, continue to gain investor traction, he added.
 Apart from debt funds, investors pumped in Rs 11,710 crore in equity-oriented mutual funds during the quarter under review, against an investment of Rs 30,703 crore in the March quarter.
 The slump was mainly on account of market volatility and uncertain economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Let me just be very blunt: I believe Chad Knaus and Jimmie Johnson are the best to ever get it done. Period,” Gabehart said afterward. “The reason is sustainability. The years upon years upon years that they did it is hard to burn the candle that hot for that long. So bar none, I would never put myself in that category. That’s not for me to do.”
 It’s not just sustainability, though, it’s sealing the deal on the final race weekend of the year. Hamlin came close to winning the championship in 2010, when he won an astounding eight times only to have a poor qualifying effort at Homestead and some minor damage during the race torpedo his chances. And last year, when Gabehart’s aggressive decision to tape off the front of his car late in the race caused some overheating issues and allowed teammate Kyle Busch to win the title.
 Hamlin has a few things working for him right now.
 For one thing, the Gibbs stable started to gain some momentum at Kansas. Martin Truex Jr. finished behind Brad Keselowski in third, and Erik Jones finished behind Harvick to give the team three of the top five finishers. Busch was a bit farther back in 11th, but he also won a stage to earn his first playoff point of the season.
 For another thing, Hamlin is coming up to a run of tracks that he likes. He’s won three times at New Hampshire and twice at Michigan, which will host a weekend double-header. Should Hamlin advance in the playoffs, he’d return to Kansas in October for the Round of 8 and the penultimate race is at Martinsville, where he also has won five times.
 “We can win every single week,” Hamlin said. “I know my equipment is good enough to do it. I still need to get better at some tracks, but certainly I go to the track every week expecting to win. If we have what we call a green race where no mistakes are made, we’re in the top five with a shot to win. It’s on me to have those green races.”

Driven by investments in liquid schemes as also banking and PSU funds, debt mutual funds saw an inflow of Rs 1.1 lakh crore in three months ended June 2020 after witnessing massive redemptions in the preceding quarter.Most individual categories that invest in fixed-income securities, or debt funds, saw inflows. However, credit risk, overnight, ultra-short duration, medium duration and dynamic bond funds saw withdrawals.The positive inflow pushed the asset base of debt mutual funds to Rs 11.63 lakh crore at June-end from Rs 11.5 lakh crore at the end of March, according to data with Association of Mutual Funds on India (Amfi).As per the data, inflows into debt mutual funds were at Rs 1.1 lakh crore in the three months ended June, compared to outflows of Rs 1.13 lakh crore in the January-March quarter.Investment into such funds was at Rs 19,690 crore during the quarter ended June 2019.Nearly 80 per cent of the total inflows during the quarter under review in the fixed-income segment came through liquid funds, where most of the institutional money is parked.Liquid funds, with investments in cash assets such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial paper for the shorter horizon, witnessed inflows amounting to Rs 86,493 crore during the quarter under review. The segment had witnessed an outflow of Rs 94,180 crore in the March quarter, typically due to advance tax payment requirements.In addition, banking and PSU category, which is considered as a safe option, received inflows of Rs 20,912 crore in the quarter ended June 2020, compared to a withdrawal of Rs 66 crore in the previous three months.As a mandate, such funds need to invest a minimum of 80 per cent of their total assets in debt instruments of banks, public sector undertakings, or public financial institutions.

“We have not come up with a decision on having spectators or fans coming in,” DeWitt explained. “One of the tasks force committees came up with rules for conditioning during the off-season and I think we have done really well as a county. Some of the recommendations from SMAC, we are already doing and we are ahead of the game. They recommended a waiver, which we have, they recommended temperature checks, which we do, and a few other things that we are already doing. I am very happy with what the task force committee recommended to us. Our student athletes got used to it, our coaches got used to it and it is now just the norm. It is good for the kids to have some activity and to have some normalcy to their lives. We are in a good situation right now.”
 At Highlands County schools each athlete has their temperature checked upon arrival and that will be the same when they go to school to make sure they aren’t showing symptoms. If a student does have a fever or symptoms they will be sent home and advised to see a doctor. During practices athletes social distance, shared equipment is sanitized between each use and groups are no larger than 10 people and that includes the coaches. The schools are doing everything they can to follow the guidelines to keep students safe.
 “There are a lot of counties that have not made it to the phase where they can condition,” said DeWitt. “I’m happy that we are able to do that. Some counties haven’t had any organized conditioning at all so we are fortunate to be able to do that. Our students are getting exercise, they are monitored by their coaches and we are fortunate on that end of it.”
 Lake Placid High School is doing everything they can to protect their students and athletes.
 “Right now, we are waiting and making sure we are doing everything we can to keep the kids safe,” said Lake Placid Athletic Director Jason Holden. “In education the safety of our students is the first priority. We don’t want to rush into anything before we know what is the right thing to do. We are on track with the county and the surrounding counties, we will not be behind if we start late.”
 COVID-19 has turned the world upside down and everyone is adjusting to a new normal.
 “Just like everything else with COVID-19, we don’t know how it will affect the sports and we hate to speculate,” said Holden. “We are going to have to modify schedules and it does create stress. I know the athletes are anxious to get going and for a lot of them it is their favorite part of school. This is hard on everyone but everyone I have talked to understands that we have to be patient.”
 The Avon Park High School Athletic Director was unavailable for comment.

The number of Israelis arrested in recent days for possession of the khat plant, a stimulant common in Israel and throughout the Middle East, has risen substantially, according to the Foreign Ministry.
 The ministry sent a message of clarification stating that khat is considered illegal in the UK, despite being legal when consumed in its natural form in Israel, and that anyone caught with the illegal substance may therefore be subject to imprisonment.
 The ministry also reminded those travelling abroad - a rare phenomenon in light of the coronavirus pandemic - to check their baggage, both hand and hold luggage, for any items that may be illegal in their travel destination.
 Israelis must also not smuggle khat abroad, the Foreign Ministry and the Department of Israelis Abroad in the Consular Division stated. Such an exploit "may end with a prolonged arrest in a foreign country, with many familial expenses and mental difficulties for the person under arrest," according to a statement by the Foreign Ministry.
 Numerous Israelis were caught smuggling khat throughout the past year in Europe, with the number of arrests by October 2019 standing at 67 arrests. The arrests spanned France, Sweden, Spain, Ireland and Turkey.
 Some of those arrested for khat-smuggling were given up to two years in prison, such as an Israeli arrested in February in Paris, who was also given a fine of €14,000.
 As of February, the Department of Israelis Abroad in the Consular Division of the Foreign Ministry stated that they were dealing with over 100 cases of khat-smuggling out of Israel.    _   Yonah Jeremy Bob contributed to this report._

Highlands County schools had no intentions of starting on Monday.
 “It made no sense for us to start on Monday,” said Sebring Athletic Director Jasone DeWitt. “We have been communicating with other counties and coaches. We all have to be on the same page to have a season. There is no point of us starting now and not having anyone to play against because other counties can’t start. We wanted to wait see what the counties around us decided. We have nothing set in stone and we have the luxury of extending our season if we need to through playoff time. It is all about the safety of the schools and players.”
 The School Board of Highlands County is very involved in the decision-making process.
 “Dr. (Brenda) Longshore is very involved and is now a Highlands County School Board member,” DeWitt said. “She will have a lot of information to go off of and will decide when it is safe to play for our county. I know no matter what decisions are made not everyone will be pleased. I think us not starting is the best decision at this time. We will continue to monitor what is going on and what is going on in the school itself. If there is an outbreak at any school, I’m sure things will change. There is flexibility so that we will not miss the full fall season like we did during the spring. There is room to adjust and start later.”
 Highlands County Schools have not made a decision on whether spectators will be allowed at games or what rules will be in place if they are allowed. During player conditioning workouts, schools have a set of rules they are following.

It was hard to fathom out why the UK government had adopted a blanket approach for the whole of Spain, especially as the Balearics and the Canaries were excluded from the advice against non-essential travel. The concept of air corridors, which had originally contemplated there being regional connectivity, was kicked into the long grass. Responding to the UK announcement, the Balearic government argued that there should be a UK air corridor with the islands. But the damage was already done. Even were there to be an air corridor for the Balearics, travellers will surely think twice, given how sudden the changes in policy can be.

The Topeka Santa Fe Band will head back to Gage Park this Sunday for its final Concert in the Park of the season.
   
 The concert, which is hosted by Shawnee County Parks and Recreation, will take place at 7 p.m. Sunday at the Gage Park Ampitheatre.
   
 The concert is free and attendees are encouraged to bring blankets and lawn chairs if they don't want to use the ampitheater's seating.
   
 According to Jay Stevenson, the band's business manager and a trumpet player, the hourlong concert will feature a variety of songs, including "Cyrus the Great," "Anything Goes," "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and "Danube Waves."
   
 The Topeka Santa Fe Band, which got its start in the Capital City in 1924 as a railroad band, is made up of about 40 members.
   
 At one time, most of the band's members were associated with the local railroads and while that isn't the case anymore, tribute is still paid toward its founding.
   
 "It's a very diverse group of people that play," Stevenson said.
   
 While some of the band's other concerts have fallen through because of COVID-19, Stevenson said band members were ready to get back in front of an audience.
   
 "Generally every summer we don't just play music in the park," Stevenson said. "We also play for retirement homes, rest home facilities."
   
 Stevenson said the band is hoping for a good turnout despite recent event cancellations.
   
 The concert will offer people a good opportunity to get outside and have a sense of community, Stevenson said.
   
 "It's a good old fashioned concert like they used to have a long time ago," Stevenson said. "When they didn't have TV or radio, they would go out and enjoy live music. We are trying to keep that going."

MARSHFIELD - Character is evidenced by the work that you do when nobody else is watching. The character of several members of the Marshfield girls track and field program was on full display all spring as they continued working out and getting better long after the spreading Coronavirus pandemic had officially canceled their spring athletic season.
 The hard work did not go unrewarded as sophomore Ava LoVuolo, junior Charlotte Henning, seniors Veronica Julian and Amanda MacKinnon as well as Class of 2020 graduate Olivia Valianti all posted times and distances while training on their own that qualified them to compete at the recent NSAF Athletic.net virtual nationals.
 "I'm very proud of how hard all the girls worked this spring," MHS Girls Track and Field Head Coach Ed Ryan. "I started what would have been the first week of the outdoor season by posting workouts to our website. Each group had their own workout and they were progressing just as if we were all practicing together and running as a team.
 "Along with those workouts there were time trials and Bay State Running was doing some virtual meets so there were some incentives to keep training. Doing the workouts was hard at the beginning because the track was closed and they were always looking for places to train. I was very pleased with how many girls kept training and how they continued to do so through the entire season."
 A leading finish from the group came from MacKinnon, whose fifth place finish in 1:11. in the 400-meter hurdles earned her the title of virtual All- American. Virtual or not, that's a title she'll be able to take with her the rest of her life.
 "It's kind of insane that I can call myself an All-American," she admitted.
 MacKinnon, who will be a senior in September, is looking forward to getting back to training again with her teammates down the road.
 "It is different when you do the training by yourself. I missed being with everyone each day in practice and the adrenaline rush you get when all of your teammates are cheering you on during the race," MacKinnon said. "It really does push you forward and make you run that little bit faster in the races."
 Several of MacKinnon's teammates also posted some great times.
 LoVuola was 12th in the 400- and 800-meter dashes.
 Julian was 25th in the 400 dash.
 Valianti closed out her high school track and field career with an 11th place finish in the javelin.
 Ryan said he was proud of the effort and execution from all of his girls.
 "It's very difficult to train by yourself, without a track, and on my part not knowing exactly where they are in their training," Ryan said. "At least if we were practicing together as a team I would be able to fine tune things, but the girls did an awesome job on their own."

 Lexington football plummeted about as far it could go in 2019 with a 1-10 record, with several of the games blowouts.
 That led to a coaching change, which was not surprising even though the man who led the program was there just one season. It wasn't working.
 So the administration found someone who reached the absolute pinnacle of North Carolina high school to hopefully lead Lexington back to promised land. Eric Brown is the guy. He was the co-defensive coordinator for 2019 4-AA state champion Vance. Yep. It doesn't get any better than that.
 Brown has a tough job ahead of him. Can he do it? That remains to be seen of course. Brown, who also played college football at South Carolina, can tell Lexington's players he's been there and done that. He has walked the walk. It isn't just talk. And the guys sounds like a motivator. That's what Lexington needs.
 At the same time, success doesn't always translate from one place to another.
 Kevin Gillespie won a state championship at Page. But when he went to Asheboro, the wins were scarce. In three seasons, Gillespie was 5-28. Perhaps it was just not the right fit because Gillespie was found to be attractive by former perennial power Thomasville.
 There's plenty of history between Gillespie and Thomasville. He was on the staff for the Bulldogs' 1991 2-A state championship team. The administration jumped at the chance to get Gillespie back. He, in turn, has inspired former Thomasville defensive coordinator Roger Bryant to come home. Dickie Cline is on board, too. It sounds like they've got it going.
 The Bulldogs were 8-3 last season and return quarterback Landon Johnson. They could be primed for more success.
 Ironically, the opening was there for Gillespie because Doug Robertson left the Chair City for Page.
 And that left Asheboro in need of a coach. The administration didn't really have to make much of a search -- not with Blake Brewer already on the staff. The former Asheboro quarterback was a natural choice to take the reins.
 Brewer wanted the job and they wanted him. It was a popular choice and a great storyline -- the former quarterback takes over at his alma mater. Brewer is enthusiastic. He could be Asheboro's coach for years to come.
 Hopefully, these new coaches will have a season to look forward to.

Lexington football plummeted about as far it could go in 2019 with a 1-10 record, with several of the games blowouts.
   
 That led to a coaching change, which was not surprising even though the man who led the program was there just one season. It wasn't working.
   
 So the administration found someone who reached the absolute pinnacle of North Carolina high school to hopefully lead Lexington back to promised land. Eric Brown is the guy. He was the co-defensive coordinator for 2019 4-AA state champion Vance. Yep. It doesn't get any better than that.
   
 Brown has a tough job ahead of him. Can he do it? That remains to be seen of course. Brown, who also played college football at South Carolina, can tell Lexington's players he's been there and done that. He has walked the walk. It isn't just talk. And the guys sounds like a motivator. That's what Lexington needs.

That curators swan around, basking in an easy life. The responsibilities and work required to get an exhibition up and running can be huge, especially for those curators working within museums and publicly funded galleries.

Come discover the true Florida, just under three acres and a semi-furnished, cedar built home. But there’s more than a home here, it comes with a 26-by-40-foot building with two additional full baths. Turn it into a guest house, shop, office or enjoy it to have some great parties, as the current owners have lovingly named it “The Brown Water Bar.” Yes, it has a bar, kitchen, bar stools and even a pool table. Get the picture?
 With a gated entrance, fenced on three sides, seawall, dock and your own boat ramp, it’s one of only eight homes on the banks of Arbuckle Creek. This is your opportunity to have your own hammock with breathtaking old oak trees and true to Florida’s natural vegetation. There’s nothing like this available anywhere in Central Florida.

Masud’s oeuvre is as distinct from the fabulists’ as it is from the progressive realists’. What genre does it fall into then? In an interview with Asif Farrukhi, Masud had responded, “As for fantasy, I try very hard to steer clear of it. My stories are not fantasies, at least not in the sense of the fantastic. You cannot say their events don’t occur in real life.” In another conversation with Sagaree Sengupta, he had spoken of the telepathic process of writing; that when a writer writes of a complex personal experience in a straightforward language with all the details clear in his own mind, somehow the experience reaches the reader.
