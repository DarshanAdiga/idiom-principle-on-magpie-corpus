The NHL Entry Draft. For many owners, general managers, presidents, scouts, coaches, players, and prospects, the annual NHL Draft is one of the most exciting days on the calendar. It provides hope, a fresh start, and the chance to land the next great talent. If history is any indication, many of these great talents are found in the first round (picks 1-31). Some are slam dunks, while others take 3-10 years to develop into valuable NHLers. In many cases, these draft picks simply never make the grade at the NHL level.

As the Columbus Blue Jackets saw in their injury-plagued 2019-20 season, sometimes the answer is “Yes.” A number of players who hit the ice for the Blue Jackets this year were regulars for the team’s AHL affiliate, the Cleveland Monsters before being called up. Junior star Liam Foudy shot straight from the OHL to the NHL for a two-game visit (1 assist, 14:13 time on ice). Yet, despite leading the league in man-games lost to injury, Columbus was in a playoff position at the time of The Pause.

In a statement Thursday, Christie said he had been vindicated.
 “As many contended from the beginning, and as the court confirmed today, no federal crimes were ever committed in this matter by anyone in my administration,” he said. “It is good for all involved that today justice has finally been done.”
 He went on blame the Justice Department under President Barack Obama and the U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case, Paul J. Fishman.
 “This case was driven by a U.S. attorney and Justice Department in search of a predetermined and biased outcome,” Christie said. “In recklessly pursuing that outcome, they violated the oath sworn by every member of the Department of Justice.”
 A lawyer for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey said the court’s decision “speaks for itself” and offered no further comment.
 Fishman, now in private practice, took issue with Christie’s comments. “It is stunning, but perhaps not surprising, that Chris Christie’s response is to concoct accusations of political ambition, partisanship and personal vindictiveness,” he said in a statement. “Chris Christie may try to rewrite his legacy — and he may want to rewrite history — but the fact remains that the ‘deception, corruption and abuse of power’ was committed for precisely those reasons by his team on his watch.”
 But the self-proclaimed mastermind of the plan, David Wildstein, a former Port Authority official who eventually pleaded guilty and cooperated with the prosecution, said he was still remorseful for the lane-closing scheme.

CHINA CENSORS EU OP-ED: The European Union delegation to China says Beijing allowed a Chinese state newspaper to publish an op-ed from the delegation only after a reference to the Chinese origins and spread of the coronavirus was removed. “The EU Delegation to China made known its objections to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in no uncertain terms,” the delegation said in a statement Friday. However, it said it decided to proceed with publication because the op-ed “passed key messages on a number of our priority areas to a potential audience of more than 1 billion readers,” including on climate change and sustainability, human rights, the importance of multilateralism and debt relief for highly indebted countries. Only the English-language China Daily published the editorial, although the original agreement had also called for it to be published in the ruling Communist Party’s Chinese-language flagship People’s Daily. The complete sentence as published on the EU’s website and those of several member states said, “But the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world over the past three months, has meant that our preexisting plans have been temporarily side-tracked.” The China Daily version appeared without the words, “in China, and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world over the past three months.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown much of the television world into disarray, as many network shows are being forced to end earlier than planned. One of the latest examples of this was The CW's _Riverdale_ , which wrapped up an abridged fourth season earlier this week. With the timeline of when filming will resume - much less when the series will premiere - still up in the air, some questions have begun to pop up. Namely, the exit of two of the series' stars, Skeet Ulrich and Marisol Nichols, which were initially announced pre- pandemic. As showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa recently explained to Entertainment Weekly, the nature of production being shut down means that both actors, who play F.P. Jones and Hermione Lodge on the series, respectively, will still film their proper goodbyes once Season 5 starts filming.
 "Yeah, I've talked to all the actors and I called Marisol and Skeet and I said, 'You know guys, obviously we still want to finish the stories we started in the season.'" Aguirre-Sacasa explained. "And both of them were like, 'Of course, let's do it.' And again, neither Hermione nor F.P., this isn't a spoiler, but they're not dying. My hope is to have them be a part of _Riverdale_ for as long as _Riverdale_ continues."
 This update - as well as the confirmation that neither character is kicking the bucket - is definitely good news for fans of the series, especially given how popular the show's roster of parents has become.
 "Part of life in _Riverdale_ -- and part of growing up -- is saying goodbye to people," Aguirre-Sacasa said in a statement when the exits were first announced. "I'm grateful to Skeet and Marisol for their incredible work on the show these last four years, and we all wish them well on their future endeavors. F.P. and Hermione will never be far from our hearts. And, of course, they're always welcome back in Riverdale."
 It will also be interesting to see how those exits factor into Season 5 overall, as the series still has some pretty major plot points to deal with.
 0comments
 "We had written episodes 20, 21, and 22 and when we talked about season 5 and some of the big events like prom and graduation, it would feel like a cheat if we somehow didn't do those," Aguirre-Sacasa revealed. "So we're essentially starting the season with the last three episodes of season 4, and partly because they're dynamite episodes. I mean big, big, big changes happen. We are continuing the mystery and the relationship drama straight into season 5."

BALTIMORE — The lawyer for the wife of Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas said she is being subjected to an “unfounded ongoing investigation” by Texas police after she allegedly pointed a gun at her husband’s head upon finding him in bed with another woman last month.

 The affidavit says Nina Thomas admitted to pointing the pistol at Earl Thomas’ head “with the intent to scare him.” She had taken the magazine out of the gun and disengaged the safety, but police noted “she was unaware the gun had a round in the chamber.”

 Angie Johnson, chief nursing officer, said people should still use caution. She has a conversation with the University of Kansas Medical Center daily.
 “They say the three things that you need to help combat communicable disease: you need an effective treatment, you need a vaccine and you need robust testing,” she said. “We are opening back up and we have none of those. So it falls down to personal responsibility.” People just need to make smart decisions, she said.
 “Until we have any of those things, rapid ability to test within minutes, effective treatment that works or a vaccine. With other communicable diseases we have at least one of those things,” she said. “This is one of the rare times that we have none. Just because we are open, doesn’t mean it is safe.”

Use of carbon black of semi- reinforced grade in rubber and automotive industries is increasing in regions such as Europe and North America. Carbon black is largely utilized in the rubber sector. Non-tire applications of carbon black include rubber products such as conveyor belts, flaps, hoses, and gaskets. In the plastics industry, carbon black is used for conductive packaging, semi-conductive cable compounds, and films. As a pigment, carbon black used in a wide range of applications such as printing, carbon paper, inks, paints & coatings, dry-cell batteries, electrodes, and carbon brushes. Several major companies in the market are highly investing in research & development of specialty-grade carbon black in order to meet the rising demand from end-user industries such as paints, high-performance coatings, and inks & pigments.

When the City Council met late last year to discuss future capital improvement projects, the need for a outdoor warning system was expressed by the majority of the city council.
   
 The debate isn't new. A panel of experts in the 2013 Emergency Warning Task Force recommended purchasing outdoor warning sirens to be used only for tornadoes. In 2014 the Citizens Advisory Committee also recommended the City Council purchase an outdoor warning system.
   
 The Citizens Advisory Committee wrote that Lubbock is the only city in Tornado Alley with a population greater than 200,000 that doesn't have outdoor warning sirens.
   
 The issue comes up yearly when the region enters tornado season and looks back on the catastrophic 1970 tornado. One thing tornado sirens have working in their favor is cost.
   
 When city leaders were discussing a potential bond election in 2015, tornado sirens were estimated at more than $10 million. Now, city leaders say they can come at a cost of $1.1 million. The material is cheaper, as is the maintenance and the connection.
   
 When Lubbock's current city council was talking about a potential 2020 bond election, which was before the COVID-19 outbreak consumed all matters of discussion, it was said that those funds can be found in the city's annual operating budget. Tornado sirens wouldn't require a bond election.
   
 Again, this was before COVID-19. The city expects to see a significant hit in revenue, particularly in sales tax, which is the highest budget driver. It could put most projects on hold.
   
 Mayor Dan Pope said he believes the council wants to get this done, but it'll be a decision for the 2020-21 budget, which needs to be approved prior to October 1.
   
 "I think the desire of the council was very clear around tornado sirens," Pope said near the end of April. "We need to find a way to get it done. I think there was some thought we could find a way to do it in this year's budget. I would say in light of the situation we're in now that's probably unlikely.
   
 "However, I think it's very likely to be a decision during budget time," he continued. "The technology has gotten more affordable. The sirens are smaller and easier to maintain with batteries and solar technology. There are a lot of reasons why it makes sense to do it."
   
 The city launched a personal alert system several years ago. The city says LBKAlert is a way to alert and engage the community in a variety of different ways through call, text or email notifications. The method of contact is at the subscriber's discretion, and in the event of an emergency any mobile device within the designated distance will receive a notification.

Teams often stay below the 50-contract limit to allow some flexibility for trades (or for financial reasons).

 Businessmen were eager to exploit the new film craze. In 1912, two new cinemas opened. They were The Picture House and The Olympia. In 1915 The Empire opened. Its managing director, Mark Freedman, was a key figure in the Huddersfield cinema world. He was a Jewish tailor and immigrant from Eastern Europe.
 Critics said the people of Huddersfield would not accept longer films, but Freedman thought otherwise. He brought The Battle of the Somme and the great silent epic The Birth of a Nation to Huddersfield.
 Freedman’s career in early cinema management was extensive. In 1912, he opened The Olympia before going on to manage The Empire. Later, he became managing director of The Princess cinema, and finally The Savoy in Marsh. His rags to riches story came to an end when he died, aged 70, in 1942.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer who alleged Joe Biden sexually assaulted her 27 years ago, is being represented by a prominent lawyer and political donor to President Donald Trump’s 2016 Republican campaign.Attorney Douglas Wigdor told The Associated Press he was not currently being paid for his work with Reade. His firm also denied there was a political motivation for his decision to represent Reade in her accusations against Trump’s presumptive Democratic opponent in the November election.“We have decided to take this matter on because every survivor has the right to competent counsel,” the firm said in a statement.Reade has said for weeks that she was struggling to find a lawyer willing to represent her. She’s accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, when she worked on his Senate staff. He has denied her allegation.On Thursday, Reade said she wanted Biden to be “held accountable” and called on him to drop out of the presidential race. Her comments came in her first on-camera interview, conducted by former Fox News and NBC News journalist Megyn Kelly.Pressed by a Florida television station about Reade’s comment, Biden reiterated his denial of the allegation.“The truth is what matters,” he told Bay News 9. “In this case, the truth is these claims are flat-out false.”Wigdor is well known for his work on prominent cases related to sexual harassment and assault. He represented six women who accused Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer, of sexual misconduct. He has also represented a number of Fox News employees in cases alleging gender and racial discrimination at the network, including Juliette Huddy, one of the women who accused Bill O'Reilly of pursuing a sexual relationship with her and retaliating when she refused. In 2018, he spoke out in the media defending Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.Wigdor has been a supporter of Trump and provided about $55,000 in campaign contributions in 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records. He has also given tens of thousands of dollars to state and local Democratic politicians in New York, including New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and New York Attorney General Letitia James. He has not donated to either Trump’s or Biden’s 2020 campaign.Wigdor said he plans to help Reade in her dealings with the media and any independent investigations into her allegations that might occur. He said the two have not discussed bringing a lawsuit based on her claims, but he did not rule that out.Wigdor suggested Reade's earlier struggles to find a lawyer to represent her were the result of “politics.”“I think highly of a lot of these people,” he said. “These are my friends and colleagues, people who I respect, but they tend to be Democrats or liberals, and they were not interested, because of that, in representing Tara Reade.”Over the weekend, another attorney, William Moran, told the AP he was working with Reade.Moran, who works at a law firm in Columbia, Maryland, previously wrote and edited for Sputnik, a news agency founded and supported by the Russian state-owned media company Rossiya Segodnya. A January 2017 report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign said Sputnik was part of “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine,” which “contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.”Reade herself has faced questions about her past writing praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reade on Thursday expressed concern to Kelly about having been “called a Russian agent” and said she had received a death threat from someone who “thought I was being a traitor to America.”There is no evidence to suggest Reade or Moran worked at the behest of Russia with respect to the Biden allegation.Moran contacted the AP on behalf of Reade to complain about and seek changes in a story detailing what Reade says she remembers writing in a Senate complaint about Biden. Reade told the AP she did not allege sexual assault in the complaint and did not explicitly use the words “sexual harassment,” though that is the behavior she believes she was describing.Moran told the AP in a text message Thursday that he found the focus on his past work “disgraceful.” He said Reade requested that he reach out to the AP “on a limited matter.”“I do not turn away clients who I believe and who have credible causes of action. I never will,” he said.Wigdor said Reade told him she was connected to Moran through Katie Halper, a podcaster who first interviewed Reade about her sexual assault allegation against Biden in March. It’s unclear how Reade connected with Wigdor, who said he believed she found the firm through “word of mouth and our reputation.”Reade first spoke out about her alleged interactions with Biden in 2019, telling journalists he had touched her inappropriately while she worked on his Senate staff. She came forward in 2020, around the time Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, with new allegations of assault.She says she didn’t initially disclose the assault allegations because she was scared of backlash and was still coming to terms with what had happened to her.___AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace and writer Brian Slodysko contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Despite only spending two seasons in the NHL, Jiri Sekac saw his share of travels; four different teams tried to find the offensive spark that he had proved capable of overseas. After two seasons in the USHL with the Youngstown Phantoms, Sekac signed with Poprad Lev of the KHL, where he played two and a half seasons. In July 2014, the Canadiens signed Sekac to a two-year, entry- level deal. In 50 games with the team in 2014-15, Sekac recorded 16 points, earning a spot in that year’s NHL YoungStars Game. Despite this, the Canadiens opted to trade him at the 2015 trade deadline to the Anaheim Ducks, in exchange for Devante Smith-Pelly, where he recorded 7 points in 19 games.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Eight World War II veterans — the youngest of them age 96 — will join President Donald Trump at a wreath-laying ceremony Friday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe. Their hopes to mark the day in Moscow were dashed because of the coronovirus pandemic.White House officials described the veterans as “choosing nation over self" by joining Trump at the World War II Memorial ceremony.“These heroes are living testaments to the American spirit of perseverance and victory, especially in the midst of dark days," said White House spokesman Judd Deere.The veterans joining Trump include Gregory Melikian, 97, of Phoenix, who sent the coded message to the world that the Germans had unconditionally surrendered.Participants in the D-Day invasion that turned the tide in the war include Steven Melnikoff, 100, of Cockeysville, Md., Guy Whidden, 97, of Braddock Heights, Md., Harold Angle, 97, of Chambersburg, Pa.; and Frank Devita, 96, of Bridgewater, New Jersey.Other veterans joining Trump are Donald Halverson, 97, of Minnesota, who fought in some of the war's fiercest fighting in Italy, John Coates, 96, of Maryland, who fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and Jack Myers, 97, of Hagerstown, Md., was part of a unit that liberated the Dachau concentration camp.Timothy Davis, director of the Greatest Generations Foundation, which helps veterans return to the countries where they fought, said the U.S. soldiers were originally slated to travel to Moscow for a commemoration event. He said that with international travel out of the question during the pandemic, the veterans talked to him about trying to commemorate the day in Washington.“Of course, we presented to them the risk we are facing," Davis said. “They said it doesn’t matter Tim" and asked him to press ahead, saying they viewed the commemoration as “a blessing to all who fought, died and served in World War II."Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

I know I had a desk in my room but I guarantee readers that I was still in bed when classes started.
 While we only had one channel on the television, that one station would show a movie every night after the 10 p.m. news and naturally, since I didn’t have class until second period, my head never hit the pillow until after midnight.
 While I tired to listen, similar to today’s Zoom discussions, it could be difficult to hear. Once in a great while Earl Dean, my teacher in American History, would ask me a question. I think he was just testing to see if I was there.
 I have to admit that I aced the tests.
 My mother Nelda would bring them home to me to take with the textbook sitting open on my desk.
 Naturally I couldn’t carry my telephone box around the house with me like students can their iPads now. And teachers and students couldn’t observe reactions during class discussions.
 There was no sitting around the Cowboy that was on the floor in the main lobby at AHS, flirting with the girls and talking about the football game coming up.
 Because of the injury, I missed fall sports that year. I was a three-year letter winner in cross county but that wasn’t a huge disappointment.
 However, I would have been crushed to miss my final season on the golf course though I had to wear a back brace and couldn’t carry my clubs.
 High school athletics has been proven to help student achievement, especially if they have to make the grades in order to be eligible.
 eLearning is becoming the future of education as many colleges and universities offer online degrees.
 Education could change after this pandemic is finally over. Who knows where technology will take us?
 When I finally got back to the classroom in 1974 I realized there was something special about getting up before dawn, getting cleaned up, dressed up and meeting my girlfriend in the hallway before first hour.
 I won’t mention sneaking out of school to get a dozen donuts at the Carol Lee Donut Shop and eating them in the photography darkroom.
 The more things change the more they stay the same, I guess.

Out of the box, a baseball’s shiny white finish is perfect for an autograph but a nightmare for pitchers. Controlling a baseball is almost impossible without that glossy surface being marred. After trying a variety of concoctions, pitchers settled on using mud from their local ballpark. That led to other problems. Rubbing a baseball’s leather with just any kind of dirt softened the leather and left the surface scratched. Most muds darkened the ball, making it harder to see.

Even those numbers won't fully capture the scope of the damage the coronavirus has inflicted on jobs and incomes. Many people who are still employed have had their hours reduced.

Estimates in the survey ranged to as much as a loss of 35 million. Forecasts for April's unemployment rate, which was at 4.4per cent in March, were as high as 22per cent.
 There is great uncertainty surrounding last month's estimates because of the nature and speed of the job losses.
 A total of 26.5 million people had filed claims for jobless benefits and 16.2 million were on unemployment rolls through the week of April 12, when the government canvassed establishments and households for payrolls and the unemployment rate.
 Eligibility for unemployment benefits has been greatly expanded to include contractors and gig workers among others, overwhelming local employment offices with applications and leading to backlogs. Economists believe the numbers of people applying for unemployment aid and those continuing to receive benefits are understated.
 Meanwhile, some people might be filing more than one claim, and workers whose hours have been cut because of COVID-19 can also seek unemployment benefits.
 GREAT UNCERTAINTY
 Some workers who have filed claims have likely since found employment, with companies like Walmart and Amazon hiring workers to meet huge demand in online shopping. Truck drivers are also in demand, while supermarkets, pharmacies and courier companies need workers.
 According to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the employment report, a person has to be looking for work and available to do it to be considered unemployed.
 "This means many workers who lose their job as a result of the virus will be counted as dropping out of the labor force instead of as unemployed because they are unable to search for work due to the lockdown, or because they are not available to work because they are, for example, caring for children whose school has closed," said Heidi Shierholz, a former chief economist at the Labor Department.
 Furloughed workers and others who expect to return to their jobs within 6 months are counted as unemployed on temporary layoff.
 A drop in the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, could blunt some of the anticipated surge in the unemployment rate in April.
 To get a clearer picture, economists will focus on a broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment.
 April could, however, mark the trough in job losses as more small businesses access their portion of an almost US$3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for them to get loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries. The Federal Reserve has also thrown businesses credit lifelines and many states are also partially reopening.
 Still, economists do not expected a quick rebound in the labor market.
 "Given the expected shift in consumer behavior reflecting insecurities regarding health, wealth, income, and employment, many of these firms will not reopen or, if they do reopen, hire fewer people," said Steve Blitz, chief economist at TS Lombard in New York. "This is one reason why we see the underlying recession extending through the third quarter."
 Economists say the economy entered recession in late March, when nearly the whole country went into COVID-19 lockdowns.
 The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.

 The statewide gas price average in Texas was $1.50 for a gallon of regular unleaded fuel, according to the AAA Texas Weekend Gas Watch.
   
 That price is the same as the same time last week and is $1.11 less per gallon compared to the same weekend last year.
   
 Of the major metropolitan areas surveyed in Texas, drivers in Midland are paying the most on average at $1.75 while drivers in Sherman/Denison are paying the least at $1.22 per gallon. Lubbock's average gas price was $1.47 per gallon heading into the weekend - down 3 cents from the same time last week and down $1.10 from a year ago.
   
 The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded is $1.81, which is four cents more compared to this day last week and $1.08 less than the price per gallon at this same time last year.
   
 Before the coronvairus pandemic, the statewide pump price average for a gallon of regular unleaded had not been as low as $1.50 since 2009.
   
 The price dipped to its lowest point in 2020 on May 4, at $1.49 per gallon. Gas prices could fluctuate in the coming weeks, however, as gasoline demand increases around the region, and the country, as some states begin to re-open. And due to prices going up in some states, Texas has regained a spot on AAA's top 10 cheapest gas prices list, sitting at number six today.
   
 "Demand for gasoline is on the rise, and that could mean a price increase at the pump for drivers in the coming weeks," AAA Texas spokesman Daniel Armbruster said in a statement. "However, gasoline demand levels remain far below last year's figures, and that's helping keep gas prices cheaper year- over-year."
   
 Gasoline demand increased to around 6.7 million barrels per day, according to the latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's up from the nearly 5.9 million barrels per day the week prior. The EIA also reports refinery utilization remained flat at 75% in the Gulf Coast region last week. At the national level, refinery utilization is also flat week-over- week coming in at 70%.
