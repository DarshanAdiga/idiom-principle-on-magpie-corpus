Toyota's Safety Sense 2.0 suite of driver assist features is standard across the board, including automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-departure warning with steering assist, road sign assist and automatic high beams. Every 2021 Sienna has 10 airbags, including curtain airbags for all three rows and the aforementioned side airbags built into the first and second-row seats. A digital rearview mirror and a 360-degree camera with a curb view are new options, and there's also a rear- seat occupant reminder system.
 Toyota hasn't released any pricing yet, but the Sienna will go on sale toward the end of the year and will continue to be built at Toyota's plant in Indiana. It will have to face still-tough competition in the form of the face- lifted Chrysler Pacifica and Honda Odyssey and an upcoming next-gen Kia Sedona. (See how it stacks up against those competitors in our spec comparison story.) But, at least for now, the 2021 Sienna seems poised to be a major contender.

In addition to providing a welcome distraction from the 新型コロナウイルスの感染拡大 ( _shingata koronauirusu no kansen kakudai_ , spread of infection of novel coronavirus), あつ森 has been a delightful study supplement. Sure, there are the localized quirks — like the fact that recurring character たぬきち ( _Tanukichi_ ) in known as Tom Nook in English — but I've been particularly taken with the 洒落 ( _share_ , puns).
 For example, one deer character’s name is Fauna, a pun on the word "fawn," while her name in Japanese, ドレミ ( _Doremi_ ), is a nod to the word "doe" and, of course, the musical scale of do-re-mi. She ends her sentences with でしか ( _deshika_ ) — which could sound like a natural play on the conjugated forms of the frequent sentence-ender です ( _desu_ , to be): でした ( _deshita_ , was), でしょう( _deshō_ , it seems) and so on. でしか, however, contains "しか" (" _shika_ "), the Japanese word for “deer,” so it sounds more like she is saying "dearie." Dear and deer, でした and でしか — it's all very punny indeed.
 The 洒落 in the game are one of its linguistic charms, and anyone who studies Japanese will know that this kind of wordplay is prevalent in the humor. The first one I came across was the basic, 山梨だけど、山がある ( _Yamanashi da kedo, yama ga aru_ ). Yamanashi is the name of a prefecture, while " _yama nashi_ " means there are no mountains. Rendering it English it reads along the lines of, "They call it Yamanashi, but there are _yama_ (mountains)." Throwing this one out at my Japanese friends will often get a groan and accusations of spouting 親父ギャグ ( _oyaji gyagu_ , dad jokes).
 あつ森の洒落を分かったら、嬉しい ( _Atsumori no share o wakattara, ureshii_ , When I understand the puns in New Horizons, I'm happy). Upon catching the スズキ ( _suzuki_ , sea bass) in the game, the player exclaims, 「スズキを釣り上げた！鈴木…じゃなくて、鱸なのね!」 (" _Suzuki o tsuriageta! Suzuki … janakute, suzuki na no ne!_,” “I caught a _suzuki_! Suzuki… not that one, the other _suzuki_!"). This particular pun pokes fun at the common Japanese surname, 鈴木 ( _Suzuki_ ). Just as スズキ are plentiful in the game, 鈴木 are abundant in the sea of Japanese society.
 Sticking with fish, another 洒落 comes up when the アジ ( _aji_ , horse mackerel) is caught, 「さて、味はいかほどか?」 (“ _Sate, aji wa ikahodo ka?_ ” “So, how does it taste?”). Perhaps delectable when grilled with a dash of lemon juice if we’re talking about the fish’s 味 ( _aji_ , flavor).
 For 虫 ( _mushi_ , insects), the アゲハチョウ ( _agehachо̄_ , tiger butterfly) is no exception to evoking a small chuckle each time the player catches one and says, 「アゲハチョウをつかまえた！アゲアゲだ〜っ！」 (“ _Agehachо̄ o tsukamaeta! Age-age da~!_ ,” “I caught a tiger butterfly! Woop, woop!”) The latter part of that statement, アゲアゲ, expresses excitement — and that’s definitely what you feel when you catch a butterfly in this digital world.
 Life in a virtual paradise of your own design can be idyllic; しずえ ( _Shizue_ , Isabelle) cheering you on with a「本日もよい一日をお過ごしください！」(“ _Honjitsu mo yoi ichi- nichi o o-sugoshi kudasai!_ ,” “Wishing you a nice day!”) is a sweet way to kick off the day’s errands.
 Popping into タヌキ商店 ( _Tanuki Shōten_ , Nook’s Cranny) to ask,「今日のカブ価は？」(“ _Kyō no kabu-ka wa?_ ,” “What’s the price of turnips today?”) may lead to a windfall in the "stalk market." The in-game prices are no laughing matter, but the word カブ can mean both turnips (蕪) and stocks (株).
 While capitalism fuels a lot of island life in あつ森, the 住民 ( _jūmin_ , villagers) that make the grind worth it are a likable cast of eight 性格 ( _seikaku_ , personality types) that include 元気 ( _genki_ , peppy), ハキハキ ( _haki-haki_ , jock), ぼんやり( _bon’yari_ , absent-minded) and キズ ( _kizu_ , smug) animals.
 It’s not hard to guess which personality type is prone to startling the neighbors by screaming 「キンニクサイコー！！！」 ( _Kinniku saikō!!!_ , Muscles are the best!!!) at any given hour.
 Nor is it a stretch to hear a 元気 villager say,「そのエナメルのパンプスちょーイケてるね〜！」(“ _Sono enameru no panpusu chō iketeru ne~!_ ,” “Those vinyl round-toed pumps are, like, hella stylish!”).
 After a day of interacting with 住民 around the island and saving the day’s worth of work, the closing screen always reads「またいつでも遊びに来てくださいね」(" _Mata itsudemo asobi ni kite kudasai ne_ ," "Come back and play anytime"). あつ森 isn’t exactly as thrilling as an 一人称視点シューティングゲーム ( _ichininshō shiten shūtingu gēmu_ , first-person shooting game), but that may be why, in a time of heightened 不安 ( _fuan_ , anxiety), players keep making the trip back to this delightful island.

Those figures are believed to understate the true dimensions of the outbreak because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.

Three groups of 15 patients aged 18 to 55 received three different doses of the vaccine in the Phase 1 test, the complete results of which are not yet known.
 The Phase 2 trial, with 600 subjects, has already received the green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Moderna said they should begin this quarter.
 A Phase 3 trial, the largest and most important to validate the efficacy of a vaccine, should begin in July.
 "The Moderna team continues to focus on moving as fast as safely possible to start our pivotal Phase 3 study in July," said Bancel, Moderna's CEO.
 Based on the Phase 1 partial results, Moderna said they would no longer study the highest dose since the lower doses appeared to provide some effect.
 "The lower the dose, the more people we expect to be able to protect," said Moderna president Stephen Hoge.
 Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that while it was difficult to be sure of the results "from a press release," there was reason for optimism.
 "It must be noted that this is a Phase 1 study, which has an object of showing the vaccine is able to induce an antibody response and that the dose range is appropriate," Evans said.
 "It will not be until the Phase 3 trial is completed that it will be known whether the vaccine actually prevents COVID-19 disease," he added.
 Trump has said he wants 300 million vaccine doses by January 2021 to protect the U.S. population and his administration has provided funding to Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and France's Sanofi.
 The development of a vaccine usually takes years but the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused more than 315,000 deaths, has given unprecedented urgency to the search.
 A dozen clinical trials are taking place around the world, half of them in China, according to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
 China has said that it is carrying out tests on humans of five experimental vaccines.
 The challenge is not only finding a safe and efficient vaccine but also producing billions of doses.
 Several large laboratories, including Moderna, have said they would immediately begin production of an eventual vaccine even before the completion of all of the clinical trials.
 Moderna recently announced a partnership with the giant drugmaker Lonza to boost its manufacturing capacity to up to one billion doses a year.

On Tuesday, NFL owners will vote on a proposal that would place a perpetual asterisk next to hires of coaches and executives who are people of color. Should the plan receive 24 of 32 votes, teams would move 10 spots up in the third round of the draft for hiring a general manager of color, six picks for hiring a head coach of color, and get a fourth-round compensatory pick for hiring a quarterbacks coach of color.
 Well-intentioned? Probably. But it seems far more patronizing than it does empowering.
 First off, I’m not sure this is something most people of color would get behind. Two Pew Research polls from last year — one pertaining to college admissions and the other to job hiring — showed that the majority of Black, Latino and Asian-Americans oppose taking race into account when evaluating candidates. I doubt that would change when it comes to football coaches.
 Second, this plan doesn't do much to foster diversity so much as it would be forcing it.
 “I think sometimes you can do the wrong thing while trying to do the right thing,” Chargers coach Anthony Lynn, who is Black, told CBS radio. "I think this is out of desperation, this is something that we’re throwing out there, but it is what it is.
 "You can’t make people hire someone they don’t want to hire for whatever reason.”
 As it stands, there are four head coaches of color in the NFL and two general managers. Three years ago, there were eight head coaches of color. Granted, most of the coaches who were fired in that time had either missed the playoffs in consecutive years or oversaw a stinker of a season. But in a league where about 70 percent of the players are Black, the ratio of white to people of color on the coaching and executive fronts is glaring.
 How did it get this way?

We all could use a great comedy about now, but in the absence of that, the fitfully entertaining "The Lovebirds" will do. Booted from its April 3 debut in theaters by the coronavirus, the story of a warring couple stumbling into a night of criminal misadventure has landed unexpectedly on Netflix, one of the few venues where rom-coms still thrive. And this one pulsates courtesy of its fetching leads, Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani.      They're a mixed-race couple at the end of their romantic rope. What was once cooing has digressed into constant bickering. And at the start of director Michael Showalter's follow-up to the Nanjiani-penned "The Big Sick," Leilani and Jibran mutually agree to go their separate ways. But first, they must maintain appearances by attending a dinner party way down south in New Orleans. Ah, but a funny (well, mildly funny) thing occurs on the way to the soiree involving a bicyclist, a murderous cop and a blackmailed congressman. Suddenly, their love and deep knowledge of each other become essential to their survival.      There's nothing remotely original on the minds of co-writers Aaron Abrams and Brendan Gali, cribbing generously from other wild-evening-on-the-town flicks like "After Hours," "Game Night" and "Date Night," spiced with a pinch of "Eyes Wide Shut." It's an understatement to say they push the definition of plagiary to Mike Barnicle proportions. And had they not had the fortune to land Rae and Nanjiani, "Lovebirds" probably wouldn't be a night to remember.      You wouldn't think it, but in action the chemistry between the two comedians emerges a no-brainer. Which is apropos since most of "The Lovebirds" is brain- free. Why, you ask yourself, does love have to be so stupid? Apparently, Rae and Nanjiani asked themselves the same question, as they often override the shallow script by engagingly engaging in movie-saving improvisation. Their timing is impeccable and their delivery sly and subtle.      It doesn't always work, but the stars render you eager to accompany them on a dusk-to-dawn odyssey in which just about everything is thrown at Leilani and Jibran from boiling bacon grease to horrendous dialogue. The strength of both actors is their ability to sell the predictable path in which adversity only makes Leilani and Jibran's threadbare bond grow sturdier. Might they decide to give love a second chance - provided they survive the night? Dah!      Rae and Nanjiani generously give more than they receive from Showalter and the writers, who don't seem to be trying. For most of the blessedly short 85 minutes, little of what transpires makes sense. Nor is it logical, as is the case when the pair makes a confounding stop at an "Eyes Wide Shut" orgy complete with creepy bird masks. If the scene is meant as parody, it's off the mark. And don't get me started on all the shameless plugs for "Mythbusters" and "The Amazing Race," which like the movie's distributor, Paramount, is a wholly owned property of Viacom. Ain't synergy grand?      Despite its faults, "The Lovebirds" is worth your time, simply because Rae and Nanjiani are such delightful company. They're TV's version of comfort food, like chicken gumbo, going down easy in the Big Easy.      Al Alexander may be reached at alexandercritica@aol.com.      "The Lovebirds"   Cast includes Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani. Premiering May 22 on Netflix.   (R for sexual content, language throughout and some violence.)   Grade: B-

_New York, 18 mag 22:09 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il presidente degli Stati Uniti, Donald Trump, ha rifiutato un invito a un incontro virtuale dell'Organizzazione mondiale della sanità, che è proseguito oggi con i messaggi di diversi leader mondiali. Da Washington è arrivato invece un rimprovero molto forte all'Oms. Lo riporta il sito "Axios". Una fonte che ha familiarità con il pensiero di Trump avrebbe affermato che il presidente Usa non vuole avere a che fare con l'Oms in questo momento. L'Oms aveva esteso un invito a Trump all'inizio di questo mese, ma il presidente ha respinto l'invito attraverso la Missione degli Stati Uniti a Ginevra, secondo le fonti di "Axios". L'assemblea è in riunione per valutare la possibilità di un'indagine sulle origini del Covid, puntando a un accordo sulla risoluzione europea e australiana che chiede di avviare "il più presto possibile un processo di valutazione" per esaminare la risposta sanitaria internazionale e le misure adottate dall'Organizzazione in risposta alla pandemia. Il progetto di risoluzione al momento ha ottenuto il sostegno di 116 Paesi. Il testo, anticipato dalla stampa internazionale, verrà presentato domani ma necessita del sostegno di due terzi dei 194 membri dell'assemblea. Pechino si è sempre fortemente opposta all'ipotesi di un'indagine internazionale sulla pandemia. Nella bozza non si menziona la Cina o Wuhan. (segue) (Nys)
