Morin later cited a Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape analysis published in May—before the rise of the BLM protests—in the _Washington Post_ that found young black voters have significantly soured on Biden. It found that 91 percent of black voters ages 65 and up planned to vote for Biden, but that only 68 percent of black voters ages 18 to 29 planned to back Biden—23 percent less than their elders in the black community. Compared with 2016, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton won 93 percent of black voters 65 and older while she won 85 percent of younger black voters. Assuming this data is accurate, that represents a significant drop-off in support from Clinton to Biden—in just one presidential election cycle—among young black voters. In fact, Morin noted that the survey also found 13 percent of young black voters intended to vote for Trump—an increase from 2016.

For nearly a century, Illinois State University’s oldest and largest building loomed over the campus grounds and town environs. It was the Watterson Towers of its day, though instead of brutalist concrete, Old Main offered a more pleasing arrangement of brick and Italianate woodwork.
 Dedicated in 1861, the administration and classroom building was originally known as Normal Hall because, back then, ISU was called Normal University. Old Main remained the center of campus life well into the 20th century. Yet by 1946, concerns of the structural integrity kind led to the removal of the dome and entire third floor. A new roof was then placed over the second story, and the building continued to welcome students, though in a somewhat diminished state.
 On July 17, 1958, the wrecking ball took care of the rest. Today, a memorial to Old Main featuring a bell from the beloved building can be found on the north end of the ISU Quad. Founders Day tradition calls for members of the ISU community to venture out to the quad for a ceremony in which the bell is struck once for each year of ISU's existence. Read more about Old Main in this column by Bill Kemp.

I'm almost obsessed with the way that fanboys sort of take so much joy out of the pain of these artists -- not only the deep pain to create this music, but in particular, disappearing artists, like _Searching for Sugar Man_ , or people who not only just go off the grid but maybe even disappeared or have died. I find it to be so icky and sycophantic and vampiric and just gross. And I always thought, "What would it be like if they ever got face to face with that actual pain?"

Torstar Corp. (TSX:TS.B) Up one cent to 74 cents. The $60-million acquisition of the Torstar Corp. newspaper group by NordStar Capital LP was approved by shareholders Tuesday, despite a rival group's last-minute offer to increase its cash bid. A preliminary count of votes tallied after a brief online meeting showed the deal recommended by Torstar's board received the necessary support from the company's shareholders. Although the shareholder vote is a critical step in closing the deal, the transaction remains subject to regulatory and court approvals. John Honderich, who chaired the online meeting, noted that any deal requires approval from the Torstar Voting Trust, which is controlled by five families including the Honderichs, as well as a majority of class B non-voting shares. The Torstar board issued a statement Monday that NordStar's amended offer remained superior to the latest proposal from Canadian Modern Media Holdings Inc. CMMH increased its proposed offer to 80 cents per share in cash on Monday but Torstar said NordStar's offer of 74 cents per share was superior because it could be completed more quickly. NordStar's initial offer was worth $52 million or 63 cents per share when announced on May 27 but was increased after the rival group came forward with another proposal on July 10. Torstar holds an investment in The Canadian Press as part of a joint agreement with subsidiaries of the Globe and Mail and Montreal's La Presse.

Everyone agreed that busting the spy ring would blindside Medvedev, who was set to meet with Obama within days. But ignoring the spies or even letting them off the hook presented a dilemma in itself. Defense Secretary Robert Gates offered a solution: meet privately with Medvedev and reveal the real names and ranks of the nearly one dozen Russian spies and demand that they be recalled to Russia quietly and immediately. Obama did not want to embarrass Medvedev and agreed to Gates’ soft-touch proposal.

The main aim of the game here is combat, and lots of it. If you enjoy turn- based character building with plenty of loot then you're likely going to feel right at home. It's quite a streamlined game one that does away with forcing you down the path of specific skill sets and big open worlds to explore. Instead you go through various smaller maps picked from a board of missions, with each one being a series of encounters to battle through.

We think the two of them are going to have a big role in the story together moving forward, so we'd suggest to go ahead and prepare yourselves for that. We'll see precisely what the future holds both here and down the road. (There is no guarantee another season happens -- if it does, you're clearly going to be waiting a while to check it out.)

WASHINGTON (AP) — A top House Democrat demanded an apology Tuesday from a Republican lawmaker who is accused of using a sexist slur after an angry encounter with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.The Hill newspaper said one of its reporters witnessed the confrontation on Monday between Ocasio- Cortez and Florida Rep. Ted Yoho on the steps outside the Capitol. After the two separated and as Yoho descended a few steps, he appeared to utter the sexist comment “to no one in particular,” The Hill reported.A spokesperson for Yoho, one of the House’s most conservative members, denied that he had used a sexist slur and instead contended that Yoho had said “bull——” to describe the progressive Ocasio-Cortez’s policies.The comments by Yoho were “despicable and unacceptable” and require an apology on the House floor, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters.In a tweet Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she’d never spoken to Yoho “before he decided to accost me” as they passed each other.“Believe it or not, I usually get along fine w/ my GOP colleagues. We know how to check our legislative sparring at the committee door. But hey, ‘b-----s’ get stuff done,” she wrote, using one of the words The Hill reported Yoho had used.Yoho, 65, is a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and is retiring when his term ends in January. Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is a high-profile first-term congresswoman whose vociferous support for proposals like the Green New Deal has won her appearances in GOP campaign ads casting her as a liberal villain.Congressional Democrats swarmed to Ocasio- Cortez's defense on Twitter.Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who, like Ocasio- Cortez, is a member of the “Squad” of first-term congresswomen of color, wrote that Yoho had “perpetuated” the problem of violence against women with his “sexist verbal attack.”Several male House Democrats tweeted that they agreed with Ocasio-Cortez that poverty is a cause of crime and wondered why Yoho had never confronted them about their views.According to the Hill, Yoho had approached Ocasio-Cortez on the Capitol’s outside steps and said her recent comments connecting poverty to a crime surge in New York City during the coronavirus pandemic were “disgusting.”“You are out of your freaking mind,” Yoho added. Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being “rude,” the article said.Yoho spokesperson Brian Kaveney said in an email Tuesday that Yoho “had a brief member to member conversation” and had not called Ocasio-Cortez a name.“It is unfortunate that Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is using this exchange to gain personal attention,” said Kaveny.He wrote that instead, Yoho said “bull——” to himself “summarizing what he believes her policies to be.”Kaveny did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking if Yoho would apologize.Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, contrasted Yoho's remarks with the conciliatory tones often used by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the civil rights hero who died last week.“It was the act of a bully, of a person who is the antithesis of the person we are honoring this week, John Lewis,” Hoyer said. He added that Yoho’s action was “despicable conduct and it needs to be sanctioned.″___Associated Press writer Matthew Daly in Washington contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
