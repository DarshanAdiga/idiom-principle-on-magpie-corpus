Investors have been simply obsessed with the EV market. The fear of missing out has caused investors to bet heavily on many companies in the EV sector, to an extent that they have looked past the fundamentals of some firms. Investing based on speculation on how the business will evolve in the future has driven some of the EV stocks to insane heights. While there is a lot of hot air pumping up in the EV industry, quite a few stocks appear over inflated and the bubble might just be waiting to burst.

COVID-19 restrictions won't be eased in any part of the state for the next several weeks even if a region shows improvement in controlling the virus, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday.                           With ongoing fears that Thanksgiving holiday gatherings could lead to another spike in coronavirus cases, Pritzker said Illinois cannot afford to let its guard down now.                           Pritzker said hospitalizations from the virus are still 25% higher than they were during their peak in the spring. He also said that over the weekend, Dr. Anthony Fauci "offered a bleak outlook and a warning that over the next two or three weeks we may see a surge upon a surge related to the holidays."                           "He said the massive number of indoor gatherings by people visiting family and friends across the nation will very likely bring a post-Thanksgiving surge and he believes this is no time to pull back on mitigations," Pritzker said.                           In addition, the situation in the state remains precarious.                           "The dip in Illinois' cases over the last few days comes as we are seeing near record high numbers of hospitalizations, meaning that our ability to handle any new surge in COVID patients is still limited," Pritzker said. "If we are not especially careful right now, the surge will overwhelm our state's health care system."                           Consequently, Pritzker said, every region of the state will remain on the Tier 3 mitigations now in effect even if a region has shown improvement in controlling the growth in cases or showing improvement in other medical criteria.                           "We are still very much in a precarious place and we have got to take the time to evaluate any Thanksgiving effect before we make any premature adjustments," Pritzker said.                           Illinois reported another 6,190 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 Monday, the fourth day in a row that the number of new cases was below 10,000. The new cases brought the statewide total to 726,304 since the start of the pandemic earlier this year. The Illinois Department of Public Health reported an additional 85 deaths from the virus, bringing the death toll to 12,278.                           IDPH reported 5,849 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, with 1,217 of them in intensive care and 715 requiring ventilators. All of those numbers have remained relatively flat for several days.  The statewide positivity rate ticked up to 10.2 after several days at 10.1%.                           Pritzker said numbers from the last few days "have offered a hint of progress," but he also said he had hoped the state would have made more progress in reducing hospitalizations.                           "If we stay the course yet a while longer we will end this pandemic soon," said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the IDPH.                           Despite concerns about another spike in cases, Pritzker said he isn't ready to issue another stay at home order, although it remains a possibility if things get worse.                           "If everybody follows the mitigations and if we don't see as big a surge as is being discussed nationwide, we'll be able to avoid a stay at home order," Pritzker said.                           Even if a stay at home order is required, Pritzker said it will be different from the one issued in the spring that shut down most of the state.                           "It's not something right now that we think we're going to have to do," he said.                            Pritzker and Ezike warned again that while vaccines to protect against the virus could be approved soon, it will still be a long time before they are widely available to the majority of the public. Until then, people will still have to wear masks and practice distancing to help avoid spreading or contracting the disease.                           Pritzker also mentioned Springfield Mayor Jim Langfelder, Sangamon County Board Chairman Andy Van Meter and other local officials for their efforts in seeing that Tier 3 mitigation measures are being followed by businesses.

JACKSON, Mich. (WDIV) - A family in Michigan is mourning the death of not one, but two people from the coronavirus.“It’s beautiful, but it’s just so tragic,” Joanna Sisk said. “Kind of like Romeo and Juliet.”Like the star-crossed lovers, Sisk’s parents Leslie and Patricia McWaters died a minute apart.“One wouldn’t have wanted to be without the other,” Sisk said.The couple were married for more than 47 years, inseparable since the day they met.The great-grandparents passed away in the hospital from COVID-19.“But I can tell you this, that when they passed, we really do think that Mom, the boss, she definitely went to his room and took him by the hand and said, ‘Come on, LD. Let’s go,’” Sisk said.Patricia McWaters was a no-nonsense surgical nurse and Leslie McWaters was a fun-loving truck driver. Somehow their personalities were a perfect fit.“Overall, I think that it was just give and take,” Sisk said. “They picked their battles.”The coronavirus, however, was a battle this elderly couple couldn’t win.“It’s tough enough to lose one parent, but this was the worst,” Sisk said.Like so many who’ve lost loved ones to the virus, Sisk says it’s agonizing to hear others brush off the risk.“People were talking about it and not knowing that my parents were in the hospital, both fighting for their lives with it,” Sisk said. “I just had tears streaming down my cheeks, listening to them. Our entire family is completely devastated.”Copyright 2020 WDIV via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

GREENSBURG -- The Kiowa County Care & Share store in Greensburg was closed for three months due to COVID-19 restrictions this year.                           Jo Ross, president of the Care & Share board under the direction of the Kiowa County Ministerial Alliance, said it was likely that people had more time at home with canceled events, which led to an uptick in donations. However, also because of COVID-19, the number of helpers to process the increased inventory has fallen.                           For example, Ross said the community thrift store normally has 12-18 pairs of men's jeans available on any given day. However, there are currently about 60 pairs of jeans for customers to browse through. The same goes for several other items in the store. Women's jeans are in abundance at Care & Share, with even more pairs available than on the men's shelves.                           Ross said a lot of glassware and reading material has also been donated in recent weeks.                           "People don't use a lot of fancy dinnerware anymore," Ross said. "We have a lot of books right now because people are thinking, 'Well, I can read this online or on my Kindle.' There are also a lot of CDs and tapes because those aren't as popular anymore."                           There is also a great quantity of shoes, kids clothes, pictures and picture frames to be had for bargain prices at the Kiowa County Care & Share.                           "We are really full, which is wonderful because we have had such big donations so that way we can turn around and give our profits back to the Ministerial Alliance," Ross said.                           But despite an increase in donations, the number of volunteers to keep the inventory organized has declined.                           "We have about 30 volunteers plus the board, of which there are seven," said Ross. "We have a few less volunteers just because we are mostly 65 and up or 60 and up and some of (our volunteers) were more comfortable with staying home than coming in and working in the store."                           A couple of community men have given their time which has been helpful when it comes time to load the boxes of excess donations on to the Goodwill truck, Ross said.                           "We have to take the boxes out of the shed that we are sending on to Goodwill. (The items) are too old or have some damage to them," Ross said. "We have to store them in our shed then load them on a semi that comes through."                           Before COVID-19, a semi-truck and trailer traveled down US-54/400 highways to collect things from other thrift stores, but the volunteers are lucky to see a truck once a month right now. There are anywhere from 250-300 banana boxes full of things to be sent on to Wichita, so the shortage in trucks is an issue.                           "We have really run into problems (due to the lack of trucks)," Ross said. "We have had to have a volunteer or two take a load in with a trailer to Wichita when we got desperate. Last week we filled half of a semi on our own."                           Although the influx of donations and lack of semi loads has made things somewhat stressful for volunteers, they are grateful for the ability to sell things at an affordable rate and give back to the community.                           The Kiowa County Ministerial Alliance works to provide housing, food, school supplies, utilities or other expenses that residents can't cover.

The more that firms do the right thing, the more they attract stable capital flows, which leads to better outcomes for the company, for investors, and for society.”

Indeed, the EV industry is one of the most happening industries currently and offers solid upside potential on the back of climate change concerns, stricter emission rules, favorable government regulations and improvement in EV infrastructure on the back of superior technologies. However, its time investors realize that not all EV players will keep on registering gains. EV stock buying frenzy without considering the stocks’ fundamentals could result in massive loses down the road.

_I approach production and arranging by beginning with refining the vocals. When Chris writes melodies, I immediately start creating chord voicings on guitar or synth that compliment his ideas. Conner’s process is similar, but on the opposite end of the spectrum. With bass starting as the foundation leading up to the tonality and chord voicings, the result Conner and I reach together works as two sides of the same coin, marrying the bass and Chris’ lush vocals. After we have a feel for where the tune is heading, Conner and I collaborate on the groove. We are all hyper-creative and write in a quick, sporadic way. The hardest part is deciding which ideas make the cut, keeping creative freedom as the priority. My main focus is trying to set an eerie, psychedelic ambience behind these ideas, while striving to ensure it’s recorded well, and the mix is solid._

(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Gisselle Vila Benites, University of Melbourne and Anthony Bebbington, Clark University (THE CONVERSATION) Peru’s new interim president took office on Nov. 17 under unenviable circumstances. Francisco Sagasti became the South American country’s third president in a week after President Martin Vizcarra was impeached for “moral incapacity” in what many Peruvians saw as a coup by Congress. Then Vizcarra’s successor, congressional president Manuel Merino, was quickly forced to resign after furious public protest. New president Sagasti must now steer a shaken nation not just toward elections, scheduled for April 2021, but also toward renewed faith in democracy. It’s not an unprecedented mandate for a Peruvian leader. Exactly 20 years ago, Peru’s political leaders faced – and ultimately failed – a similar test, after the fall of dictator Alberto Fujimori. And their failures explain why Peru, in the words of political scientist Alberto Vergara, peered into the “abyss” of repressive authoritarianism for six days this November – with protesters facing indiscriminate and deadly violence, even kidnapping, torture, illegal detention and sexual abuse by Peruvian police. Great expectations fall short During Fujimori’s corrupt military-backed rule between 1990 and 2000, Peru’s democratic institutions were dismantled and its democratic values subverted. Dissenters faced death, disappearance and torture. Fujimori’s regime came crumbling down in November 2000 because of electoral fraud and a mass popular uprising. Fujimori was removed from office by Congress and replaced by congressional leader Valentín Paniagua. As interim president,...

It's up for pre-order starting today for $1399 and up, but the tablet isn't expected to ship until the third quarter of 2021.
 Given the long lead time, Eve is only asking customers who want to pre-order to make a down payment of $300. The rest will be charged closer to the time the tablet is ready to ship.
 That said, while the original Eve V tablet got positive reviews from tech news sites (including this one), the company ran into trouble when it came to shipping and support. All it takes is a quick scan of the /r/evev subreddit to find numerous stories from people who say they ordered a tablet years ago and have never received the tablet or a refund.
 Eve says it's resolved the manufacturing and distribution problems it had in the past, but as good as the new Eve V tablet looks on paper, I'd be reluctant to make a down payment… although I should probably point out that Eve says the pre-order prices represent a a discount over the eventual retail price. The price will go up after the first 500 units are pre-ordered.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A member of the Virginia State Corporation Commission has been confirmed to a spot on a federal energy regulatory panel, creating a vacancy for the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to fill. The U.S. Senate confirmed Mark Christie's nomination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Monday evening. Also confirmed was Allison Clements, which the commission said brings it to a full, five-member complement for the first time in nearly two years. Both Christie and Clements were nominated by President Donald Trump. The Virginia State Corporation Commission is an independent branch of state government with a wide range of responsibilities, including the regulation of public utilities, insurance and railroads. The three commissioners, elected by the General Assembly for six-year terms, oversee the work of hundreds of staff. Earlier this year, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam appointed Jehmal Hudson as a commissioner after lawmakers in the state Senate said they were unable to reach an agreement on a nominee. Christie was first elected to the commission in 2004. A White House news release called him one of the nation's longest-serving state utility regulators.

Ollie's Bargain business operating model of “buying cheap and selling cheap”, cost-containment efforts, focus on store productivity and expansion of customer reward program — Ollie's Army are likely to have contributed to the third-quarter performance. We believe that the company’s endeavors might have aided it in capitalizing on growing consumer demand for essentials and other daily purchases amid the ongoing pandemic.              However, comparable store sales growth rate for the third quarter is likely to have decelerated when compared with the sturdy second-quarter performance, due to gradual waning of stimulus impact and the reopening of other retail stores. On its last earnings call, management highlighted high teens growth in comparable store sales in the third quarter through Aug 27. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for comparable store sales for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at 12.7%.              Apart from aforementioned factors, we cannot ignore concerns related to deleverage in supply-chain cost, promotional pressure and higher expenses associated with operating through the ongoing pandemic.
