Since then Iran has walked back on its commitments including on processing uranium, which can be used in nuclear weapons.
 Tehran's latest step in January to forgo the limit on the number of machines used to make uranium more potent prompted the Europeans to trigger the mechanism.
 But the three powers said they "once again express our commitment" to the deal and expressed "determination to work with all participants to preserve it." Iran's foreign ministry said in response on Tuesday that "if the Europeans... seek to abuse (this process), they must also be prepared to accept the consequences".
 \- 'Thoughtless' - Russia condemned the "thoughtless" European move, warning it risked causing a "new escalation".
 A US State Department spokesperson said Washington fully supported the three countries, adding "further diplomatic and economic pressure is warranted".
 Zarif also said that the US killing on January 3 of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Iraq had served only to strengthen the Islamic State group.
 "I think the war against Daesh (ISIS) just suffered a major setback, and Daesh just won a major victory," he said.
 He also implied that the crisis sparked by the killing of Soleimani had contributed to Iran's accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner on January 8, killing all 176 people on board.
 "Why did it happen? Because there was a crisis. People make mistakes, unforgivable mistakes, but it happened in the time of the crisis," Zarif said.

 The transfer was completed on Wednesday following reports last week that the move was put on hold after issues arose during Randolph’s medical.
 West Ham wanted to be sure he would not break down once he joined, having recently had a thigh injury. But Randolph is fit again and, with Lukasz Fabianski out until next month with a hip injury, he could go straight into the team ahead of David Martin when the Hammers host Everton in the Premier League on Saturday.
 “It’s a great challenge for me and I am really looking forward to working with the goalkeepers here and helping the team in any way I can,” said the Republic of Ireland international.

Fourth time's the charm? Rylan Kleiter and his Team Saskatchewan rink think so -- or at least they hope so.
 Skip Rylan Kleiter, third Trevor Johnson, second Joshua Mattern and lead Matthieu Taillon are banking on past experience as they head to the 2020 New Holland Canadian junior men's curling championship this week in Langley, B.C. They will be looking to improve on last year's bronze-medal performance.
 "The boys are ready to take it to the next step and take it to win that Canadian (title)," coach Dean Kleiter said.
 "Knowing everything that happens at this big event, they'll just be relaxed and ready to go."
 The junior men's squad -- as well as the Team Saskatchewan junior women's foursome of Ashley Thevenot, Rachel Erickson, Paige Engel and Mary Engel -- are set to receive a grand send-off Wednesday night at the Sutherland Curling Club in Saskatoon.
 Three members of the Kleiter team -- Rylan Kleiter, Taillon and Mattern -- have curled together for a decade, including winning a provincial high school curling title. Taillon says they are "best friends so it makes it really easy."
 They've played in about 800 games together, which skip Kleiter says is "definitely a game-changer for us, just knowing each other and what we do on and off the ice and how to get the best out of each other is really important.”
 When Johnson joined the squad six years ago, "we haven't looked back," said Dean Kleiter.
 "They just have to look at each other and they know what the other guy is thinking. They're really turning it on now. As you get into these bigger competitions, the focus gets a little more intense. It's looking really good. I'm excited."
 Last year, Saskatchewan finished second in Pool A, behind eventual champion British Columbia, with a 5-1 record. Kleiter's team placed second overall in the championship pool with an 8-2 record before losing its semifinal to Manitoba.
 The foursome has taken away a piece or two from each of their appearances at the national championship, said Rylan Kleiter. This year, their main focus is on patience and waiting for their opportunities.
 “We know that if we do what we do, we’ll be right there,” he said, noting that they are the only squad with each member returning from last year. “We had a good provincial, but we know there’s still some left in the tank to take our game to the next level.
 "It'll be fun. We'll have a little bit of a target on our backs so we're looking forward to embracing that."
 The team leaves Thursday for Langley, where Kleiter -- a kicker and receiver in football -- helped the Saskatoon Hilltops win a Canadian Bowl championship in November.
 Teams will practice Friday, with competition beginning Saturday. Half of the games will be played on modified arena ice and the other half on regular curling-rink ice.
 "Learning how to throw on that arena ice is definitely huge, but it's a long week so you have to keep that in mind, too," said Taillon.
 "Even though it is, you still have to win early. But even if you do get a loss early, you can come back and really put it to them in the end."
 The championship covers 10 days. It's a grind on the grand stage.
 "Our first year when we were there, we were kind of in awe," Kleiter admitted.
 "We didn't really know how to react. Now, getting on that different kind of arena ice, and that experience there, will be a game-changer for us."
 All four members of the rink are 21 years old, so this is it for eligibility as junior curlers. It's now or never on this national stage.
 "I think it's the most confident we've gone in yet," Taillon said. "Now we're kind of calm, cool and collected as opposed to the past when we were kind of jittery and excited."

NORMAL -- Former Illinois Valley Central and Illinois State player Chris Razo has been named interim coach of the Heartland baseball team, according to a release from the school.
 The 2009 IVC grad joined Heartland in 2018 as pitching coach. The former Journal Star Player of the Year replaces Jimmy Frankos, who was hired as an assistant coach at Iowa.
 "Coach Razo ... understands the history and impact Heartland Community College can have on a student-athlete," athletics director Ryan Knox said in a release. "I am very confident in Chris's ability to further our athlete's success on and off the field."
 While at ISU, Razo was a first-team all-Missouri Valley Conference pick and won its Pitcher of the Year award. He helped lead the Redbirds to a school- record 39 wins and the first and only MVC outright title. He was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2013 and played two seasons in the minor leagues.
 While at Heartland, Razo was first team all-Region 24 and Mid-West Athletic Cconference Pitcher of the Year. He helped the school to its first appearance at the NJCAA Division II World Series.
 "I am beyond excited to take over this program that I have now been part of as a player and a coach," Razo said in a release. "My best baseball memories on and off the field came from Heartland and I hope that's the same for all the players.
 "Our goal has always been to win a national championship and that will not change. We expect to go to compete for a national championship this year."

This nation had just been through eight years of a president with dark skin, and it is no secret that this drove many European Americans into a type of madness.

Although the investing process is fairly straightforward, securing consistent returns in the stock market is not easy. Throwing hard earned money at un- researched investments can eventually lead the investor down the road to ruin. Every individual investor may have different goals when starting out. Aligning these goals with a specific plan can create a solid foundation for the future. Nobody can predict what the future will hold, but being aware of market conditions can be a great asset when attempting to navigate the terrain while mitigating risk. Once the vision of the individual investor is clear, the road to sustaining profits may be much easier to travel.
