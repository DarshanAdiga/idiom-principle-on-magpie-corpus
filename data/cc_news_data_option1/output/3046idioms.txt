ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Microsoft post. But the company said in a statement published Sunday on Toutiao, the Chinese social media site it owns, that it "has always been committed to becoming a global company."


  "In this process, we are faced with all kinds of complex and unimaginable difficulties," the company added. It cited a "tense international political environment," among other issues.


  "But we still adhere to the vision of globalization and continue to increase investment in markets around the world, including China, to create value for users around the world," ByteDance said. "We strictly abide by local laws and will actively use the rights granted to us by the law to safeguard the legal rights of the company."


  TikTok did not respond immediately to a request for comment Sunday night, but a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business on Saturday that it is "confident in the long-term success" of the app. The company has hired nearly 1,000 people to its US team this year, and plans to hire another 10,000 employees across the United States, the spokesperson said. It also recently announced a "Creator Fund" to lure top talent to create content for the app.


  Beijing, meanwhile, blasted Washington after Trump floated a ban.


  "The US has been stretching the concept of national security, without any evidence, and only based on presumption of guilt. It is threatening certain businesses," Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Monday. "China is firmly opposed to this."


  TikTok could be the "right partner at the right time" for Microsoft, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives, who pegged the app's valuation at roughly $50 billion. (He added, though, that TikTok's value could be hurt considerably if it were to be shut down.)


  Ives added that if the sale is successful, Microsoft would also receive a social media "crown jewel" at a time when tech peers like Facebook and Google parent Alphabet are facing regulatory scrutiny, making it difficult for them to consider Tiktok.

Then the coronavirus crisis got worse. The bank suspended most of its restructuring plans earlier this year, saying it hoped to reduce uncertainty for employees amid the pandemic.
 Now, Quinn said, the bank will have to "accelerate" those plans, as well as review "what additional actions we need to take in light of the new economic environment to make HSBC a stronger and more sustainable business."
 Worsening relations between China and the West have also put HSBC in a tight spot.
 Chinese state media, for instance, has accused HSBC of colluding with the United States in its legal fight against Huawei, the Chinese tech giant. The bank last week denied those allegations.
 Asked about US-China tensions on an analyst call Monday, Quinn stressed that the bank had not seen "any material impact" from the issue on its business in the first half of the year.
 Chinese state media has previously suggested that the bank could appear on a long-rumored list of "unreliable" foreign companies that China could blacklist. The bank has also been floated as a potential target for retaliation by Beijing in its battle with the West over trade, technology and national security.
 "It's not right or proper for me to speculate on what may or may not happen with regard to sanctions," Quinn said. "But I come back to, we've seen a very strong performance in the first half of this year from our business in Asia."
 The company pulled in $7.4 billion in pre-tax profits in Asia over the first half, "demonstrating the strength and continued resilience of our operations in the region," HSBC said.
 Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson added that the bank would look out for a number of factors in the second half, including US-China tensions and "any impact this has on our Hong Kong franchise."

And that’s presuming the properties in question come onto the market for €371,000. The report makes clear that the private sector can’t build homes at affordable rates and that the cost of construction is now terminally out of kilter with wages. And it’s questionable whether a big jump in supply – long seen as the solution – is going to square the circle. Equally Government initiatives aimed at bridging the affordability gap such as Help to Buyreinforce prevailing market prices, and may even be inflationary.

You can't fault the players who opt out of the 2020 NFL season. On the Patriots, the reasoning behind the eight opt outs were clear - players wanted to protect themselves, older parents, their children, newborn babies and in a couple cases, their unborn children.
   
 The Patriots have an NFL-high eight opt outs with Dont'a Hightower, Patrick Chung, Marcus Cannon, Brandon Bolden, Matt LaCosse, Dan Vitale, Marqise Lee and Najee Toran. Of course, even with the players who opted to play, they admit the decision wasn't easy.
   
 On Sunday, we heard from four Patriots captains who all have justified reasons for not playing this year. These players admitted the choice play wasn't easy, but they're heading into this 2020 season trying to remain optimistic. One of those players is David Andrews.
   
 No one would've been surprised if the Patriots center opted out. Last year, he missed the season due to blood clots in his lungs. He said after discussing his choices with his family and doctors, he is all-in for 2020.
   
 "My choice has been made," Andrews said. "Talking with doctors and my wife, it's something we feel comfortable with. I'm just excited to get the chance to go out there and compete again."
   
 Andrews situation is a rare one, but he isn't the only player who's dealt with health issues. Cannon is a survivor of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. When he opted out, it wasn't a surprise. Although it's a blow anytime you lose your right tackle, having Andrews back in the lineup will help the Patriots move forward.
   
 As it turns out, Matthew Slater also has his own medical condition and reasons that would've made it understandable if he chose to opt out. The 34-year-old deals with asthma and has three small children at home. It was reported by the NFL Network that Slater nearly opted out. Slater's wife, Shahrzad, is a Providence-based doctor and he admitted the chose to play was really difficult after speaking with her
   
 "With my wife having the background that she does as an MD, I think that she knows a little bit more and it made the conversation a little bit tougher," Slater said. "Obviously, my parents have their own concerns. I have a young family that I'm trying to raise… It's been difficult. You want to make sure you're hearing from the Lord and doing what he wants you to do. You don't want to be selfish. You don't want to be just acting just on the spur of the moment or off emotions whether it be fear or excitement, whatever it might be. We tried to be as prayerful about this as we could. We feel at a place of peace now. I think it's just a matter of us moving forward, continuing to pray and continue to support my family at 1 Patriot Place, continue to support the Slater family. There is no easy decision for this."
   
 Having the captain and Pro Bowler special teamer back is important for the Patriots and the same goes for James White and Devin McCourty. White's wife, Diana, gave birth to their first child last season and she's currently pregnant again. McCourty and his wife, Michelle, have two children under four.
   
 White represents one of the best receiving backs in the NFL. After losing Chung, McCourty's services are certainly needed in the Patriots secondary. The team is certainly happy they're playing, but both recognize that the decision wasn't clear cut.
   
 "It's definitely not an easy decision," White said. "Little one at home, my wife is pregnant, so definitely a lot of consideration. It's definitely not an easy choice like Slate was saying. Don't want to be selfish knowing you love and want to play the game. But we want to protect our families at home, our teammates and coaches and everybody. Definitely a difficult choice, but I feel like we're trying to take the right steps and follow the precautions at the stadium.
   
 "We'll trust in one another to do the right things outside the locker room so we don't bring any unnecessary things into the locker room. At the same time, we all can do the right things and stuff still can happen. Just have to be as cautious as possible. Just keep everybody trusting in one another so we can all be safe."
   
 Of course, players do have a deadline to opt out (the date is either this Wednesday or Saturday) and anyone could change their mind.
   
 "I'm still out here having fun and figuring things out," McCourty said. "So, we'll see how we go."

US regulators have repeatedly expressed concerns around TikTok's data collection and a potential links to the Chinese government. TikTok, whose CEO Kevin Mayer is the former executive behind the success of Disney+, has made a series of moves to distance itself from affiliation with the politics of its parent nation. That includes ceased operations in Hong Kong in light of stringent new security laws introduced from mainland China, and the hiring of thousands of US staff – but so far, those efforts seem to have fallen short in appeasing US regulators.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Sorry, boomers. Millennials and their younger siblings and children now make up a majority of the U.S. population. A new analysis by the Brookings Institution shows that 50.7% of U.S. residents were under age 40, as of July 2019. The Brookings' analysis of population estimates released this summer by the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the combined millennial, Generation Z and younger generations numbered 166 million people. The combined Generation X, baby boomer, and older cohorts represented 162 million U.S. residents. “To many Americans — especially baby boomers themselves — this news may come as a shock. For them, the term “millennial” has been associated with a youthful, often negative, vibe in terms of habits, ideology, and politics,\" William Frey, a senior fellow at Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program, wrote in the analysis. “Now, the oldest millennial is 39, and with their numbers exceeding those of baby boomers, the millennial generation is poised to take over influential roles in business and government.\" Those under age 40 are more diverse than the older cohorts, with almost half identifying as being part of a racial or ethnic minority. Past surveys show that the younger generations split from the older generations on issues such as immigration reform, criminal justice reform and environmental protection, and the pandemic and recent racial justice protests are likely to galvanize the younger groups to promote an array of progressive causes, Frey wrote. Millennials typically are defined as being born between 1981 and 1996. Baby boomers, long considered a primary driver of demographic and social change in the U.S. because of their large numbers, were born between the end of World War II and the arrival of the Beatles in the U.S. in 1964.

In his statement, Mastriano said much misinformation about the governor's COVID-19 restrictions has been floating around. For some people, it has not been clear that churches are exempt from the requirement that indoor gatherings be limited to 25 people. Whether churches can convene is among many questions Mastriano said his office receives every day.
 In response to the letter's "church hopping" allegation, Mastriano said he "simply" meant that if people want to attend church but theirs is not open, they could consider going to another that is hosting "in-person services."
 Mastriano said he would prefer the clergy behind the letter instead address a number of other state issues and legislation, from abortion to funding for emergency responders.
 "The fact of the matter is not one of those who signed the letter made any effort to discuss their concerns with the Senator," said Mastriano's spokesperson. "These misguided clergy members used their religious positions, and non-profit status, to launch a political attack against a Senator in contravention to both Matthew 5 and Romans 13. Therefore, their malicious attack can be discounted as not sincere or viable."
 Mastriano won a special election just over a year ago for the 33rd District Senate seat.

A funeral mass for Patricia Firmin Martin, 80, of Baton Rouge, will be held at noon Tuesday, August 4, 2020, at St. Thomas More Catholic Church. Pat died unexpectedly at home on Thursday, July 30, 2020, leaving a huge void in the lives of her family and friends. She was a devoted mother, grandmother, great- grandmother and friend who loved nothing more than preparing and serving delicious meals to those fortunate to enjoy her gift for hospitality. She had a flair for fashion and was always beautifully dressed, hair and make-up perfect, without fail, daily. She was a talented and creative artist and seamstress, an avid worker of crossword puzzles, a lover of books and music, dinner out with friends, Bombay Sapphire martinis and more recently, Facebook, where she regularly shared humorous and heartfelt updates on life with family and friends. She was a faithful member of St. Thomas More Catholic Church. Pat was a native of Simmesport, LA, the daughter of the late Lemme John Firmin and Mildred Aswell Purpera. She graduated from Istrouma High School and worked in the banking and real estate fields, retiring after a long career as the receptionist at the Piccadilly Cafeterias corporate office where her vibrant personality and style endeared her to coworkers and everyone who entered the building. She is preceded in death by her beloved husband of 59 years, J.H. Martin, and her sister, Ethel Fryou of Baton Rouge. She is survived by her three children and their spouses, Leslie and Jesse Young of Wisner, Jay and Karen Martin of Baton Rouge, and Tracey and Rejean Bouchard of Quebec, Canada; seven grandchildren and their spouses, Jessica and Joe Handy of Baton Rouge, Michael and Maranda Young of Wisner, Matthew Martin of Baton Rouge, and Katherine, Philippe, Julian and Madeleine Bouchard, of Quebec and Emmanuel Comtois of South Harbor, Nova Scotia; four great-grandchildren, Evangeline and Abram Handy of Baton Rouge and Nicholas and Dorothy Young of Wisner; special niece, Michelle Fryou; and numerous other nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. The family would also like to extend their gratitude to Anthony Brooks. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Pat's name to St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Charity.

LONDON (AP) — The weekend arrest of a British lawmaker accused of rape and the sexual assault conviction of a former legislator last week are increasing pressure on Britain’s political leaders to confront a political culture that has often let abuse go unchecked. A Conservative Party lawmaker who has not been publicly named was arrested and interviewed over the weekend over rape and assault allegations made by a former parliamentary aide, U.K. media reported. London’s Metropolitan Police said officers arrested a man in his 50s on Saturday on suspicion of rape and took him into custody at a London police station. He was later released on bail. The force did not name the man, in accordance with its usual rule of not naming suspects until they are charged. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, said Monday that “it’s an ongoing police investigation so it’s not appropriate for me to comment.” Opposition lawmakers called for the legislator to be suspended, but the Conservative Party said it would await the outcome of the police investigation. Suspending the politician would effectively reveal his identity. “They are very serious allegations, and we do take those allegations very seriously,” said Conservative Chief Whip Mark Spencer, who is in charge of discipline among party lawmakers. “I think it is down to the police to do that thorough investigation, not for the Whips' Office to investigate this alleged crime. It is for the police and the authorities to do that.” The Conservative Party is under fire over claims the alleged victim went to party officials several months ago to complain about the lawmaker’s behavior.

The results indicate that cross-country transmission processes, specifically via international flight connections, played a particularly important role in the early stages of the virus' spread and that the shutdown of international airports and border closures were indeed important policies to prevent further spillovers across countries. It appears that governments, who took early action to reduce cross-border air passenger traffic, did in fact do the right thing to prevent the spread of infection. The research also supports anecdotal evidence that countries that delayed closing their borders to air traffic have higher infection rates.

Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske told lawmakers Friday that she wasn’t aware of any fraud in the June primary, when Nevada mailed all active voters absentee ballots and only opened a limited number of polling places to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Limited polling places in Reno and Las Vegas resulted in lines of up to eight hours. The U.S. Center for Disease Control has issued election guidance to provide a wide variety of voting options and limit crowds at polling places.In the June primary, all Nevada counties had one polling place except for Clark County, which had three in the Las Vegas area. The bill requires at least 140 polling places throughout the state in November, including 100 in Clark County, which had 179 in the November 2018 election.Christine Saunders of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada said the long waits in the June primary demonstrated why Nevada needs both mail and in-person voting opportunities."No one should have to choose between their health and voting. No one should have to choose between staying in line to vote and making it to their job on time," she said.In states such as Colorado and Oregon, which have mailed all voters ballots for years, the procedure is cheaper than holding an in-person election. But Cegavske said the equipment, education, printing and postage would cost the Nevada Secretary of State's office an additional $3 million, not including costs to counties, which distribute and tabulate ballots. Nevada spent more than $4 million in federal relief dollars in the June primary, most of it funneled to counties. More than $1 million went toward leasing counting and sorting machines to accommodate a greater number of absentee ballots.Cegavske, the state's top election official and only Republican to hold statewide office, opposed the revised procedures. She blasted the Democratic-controlled Legislature for excluding her from discussions and said she saw a draft of the bill only a day before the vote in the state Assembly."We were not involved in this bill's writing at all ... I wish somebody would have asked us about because we could have told you what we had planned," she said Friday.To bypass Cegavske and enact the changes, the bill gives the governor the power to command the Secretary of State to adjust election procedures during a declared state of emergency. It passed on a party-line vote through both the state Senate and Assembly, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. Republicans were particularly distressed with provisions of the bill that expand who is allowed collect and hand in ballots. They warned it would enable a practice detractors call "ballot harvesting," in which volunteers working for political groups collect and turn in large quantities of ballots to tip the scales in elections."It's a safeguard that our state I believe we need ... I feel that taking it out — and it is in this bill — would be devastating, not only to us, but to our state," Cegavske said.Democrats argued allowing people other than family members to return ballots would help groups like members of Nevada’s 32 Native American tribes, who have historically faced difficulty voting and live far form polling places, and seniors who may need assistance with voting and fear venturing to the polls.In the June 2020 election, all voters were mailed ballots and 1.6% voted in-person on Election Day, a tiny share compared to the 34.2% in the state who voted in-person in the November 2018 election.___Sam Metz is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

In California’s Coachella Valley, people are concerned about catching the novel coronavirus.
 “They’re scared; they’re freaking out,” said Jorge Garcia, who contracted the virus. “I was scared at first because you hear a lot of stories that people don’t make it, they get really sick.”
 A lot of people in the desert community, located about two hours east of Los Angeles, are getting sick.
 Local county health officials report more than 36,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the area and more than 680 deaths.
 Now, health experts say there aren't enough doctors and nurses to handle the spike in cases.
 “At one point we had over 90 patients in the hospital with COVID,” said Alan Williamson, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage, Ca. “I think we had about three beds available at our peak.”
 Williamson says his staff is overworked and pushed to its limits. And that bringing in traveling nurses to help lighten the load is no longer an option.
 “Because of national nature of this pandemic, all of those resources were basically tapped out,” he said.
 Now, help is on the way from the United States military.
 “The Department of Defense is committed to this fight,” said U.S. Army Major General Mike Stone, who is helping lead a joint military team to help civilian hospitals fight COVID-19.
 “We’re tailoring the force,” he said. “We’re giving exactly what’s required where it’s needed on the frontlines to save people’s lives.”
 To help slow the spread of this virus and provide relief for staff, Stone says the Department of Defense has sent nearly 600 health care workers from different branches of the military to support almost two dozen hospitals in California and Texas.
 “There is a lot of need and if we can save a life, that’s why we’re there,” he said.
 The cost of this mission has not been totaled, but Stone says the price is well worth it, as the military shows its commitment to the country.

If Tagovailoa and Fitzpatrick are healthy, however, Rosen’s playing time could be non-existent.


  Rosen’s potential trade value, which could be estimated as a third-day draft pick, could rise if another NFL team potentially loses their starting quarterback to an injury or COVID-19 concerns.


  In the long term (or at least after this season), Rosen is still a relatively cheap and talented option to have on the roster. He is owed roughly $2 million in 2020 and $2.8 million in 2021, which are both fully guaranteed.


  Also, Fitzpatrick is in the final year of a two-year deal he signed with Miami, which will pay him $8 million this season.

Nucleosomes, spool-like structures resembling beads on a string, make up chromatin, a term to describe DNA wrapped around proteins called histones. Chromatin is found throughout the genome, which in humans contains an estimated 20,000 genes and much other genetic information. Modifications in chromatin structure, carried out by protein complexes called chromatin remodelers, regulate the turning on and off of genes for cell- and tissue- specific purposes. Malfunctions of the chromatin remodeling system have been implicated in many cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, a major focus of the Kadoch laboratory.

It won't be a bad time if you're choosing to hit the road, as over a dozen states still have average gas prices under $2 per gallon."
