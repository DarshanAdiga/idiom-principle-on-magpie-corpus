Kate Garraway praises 'brave volunteers' being infected with coronavirus for vaccine trial as husband fights in hospital

In these emails, Hunter refers to his father as the “big guy” regarding a massive business pitch to a Chinese energy firm. This reference is made regarding the equity arrangement. At Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company where Hunter sat on the board making $50k/month, the former vice president was introduced to executives at the company. Hunter got this gig in 2014, around the time his father was heading up our policy efforts in Ukraine as well. Wait, Joe said he knew nothing about Hunter’s business dealings. He also said there was no wrongdoing because he trusts his son. Yeah, not the best line to use, Joe. Burisma was also being investigated for corruption and its executives were banking on Hunter’s connections to protect the company. That happened. Joe Biden fired the prosecutor after threats to withhold aid from the country. It’s painfully clear that? Hunter was there to sell access to then-top Obama officials. It doesn’t get as unethical and swampy as this, huh?
