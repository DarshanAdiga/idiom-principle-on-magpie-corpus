Stewart, the son of Haydn and Louise Williams, was born June 21, 1935 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Stewart married his college sweetheart, Nancy B. Loomis of Canton, Ohio, on December 27, 1958. Stewart graduated from Poland Seminary High School in 1953 and attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio where he earned a bachelor's degree in business.

The day following council’s approval, June 19, community residents Mardi Harris and Suzann Bingham went to town hall to inquire as to the necessary requirements for a referendum. Information was not available on that date and on July 20 they began the process of forming a committee and obtaining the serial number required to obtain signatures for a referendum.
 The referendum committee was told they needed 109 signatures for a referendum and their deadline would be July 17. They later learned the deadline was July 20. Working in a COVID-19 environment they were challenged in safely collecting signatures but managed to turn in three times the required number on July 16.
 Though the initial review accepts the 263 signatures, and only 109 is the required to bring about a referendum, the process is not yet complete.
 According to Akins’ email to the committee, “The Town of Pinetop-Lakeside has twenty (20) days after July 16, 2020, (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) to complete our review and send a random sample of five percent (5%) of the total signatures to the County Recorder for verification.
 The County Recorder has fifteen (15) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) to certify the random sample transmitted to them and notify us if any of the individuals have been disqualified.”
 According to an employee in the Navajo County Recorder’s Office, they will verify whether the random signatures supplied is actually a voter who is registered in Navajo County.
 They will validate that the signature on the petition matches that of the registered voter which they have on file. Upon completion, they will generate a report for the county attorney to determine whether enough signatures were gathered to place the measure on the ballot.
 Town Manager Keith Johnson said he anticipates it will be around Sept. 3 before they receive information back from Navajo County.
 Johnson said, “Even then, if the signatures are accepted, an elector from Pinetop-Lakeside could challenge the sufficiency of the petition.”
 Even if all is in order, the referendum will not make the November General Election. Johnson said it would be about a four month period and would likely be around January 2021 for the mail ballot.

 “And if we see a lot of early cases in schools, it will be harder to get all of our schools open for in-person classes,” he said.

ATLANTA -- Gov. Brian Kemp Monday called a special election for Sept. 29 to fill the remainder of U.S. Rep. John Lewis' term following the civil rights icon's death earlier this month.
   
 Required by state law, the special election will only apply through the end of this year. The general election on Nov. 3 will decide who serves the next full term representing Georgia's 5th Congressional District, a seat Lewis held for decades.
   
 A runoff for the special election would be held on Dec. 1, if needed.
   
 Georgia Democratic Party leaders last week picked state Sen. Nikema Williams, D-Atlanta, to replace Lewis on the Nov. 3 ballot after the longtime congressman won the primary in June. She faces Republican Angela Stanton King.
   
 Lewis, a prominent civil rights leader who was beaten by police in Selma, Ala., during a protest march in 1965, served 33 years in Congress before his death at age 80 following a seven-month battle with pancreatic cancer.
   
 He was poised to defend his seat for an 18th consecutive term prior to his death on July 17, which sparked a complicated and quick-moving process for state Democrats to pick his replacement to square off against King rather than let Republicans claim the reliably blue district.
   
 Kemp, a Republican, announced the Sept. 29 special election as Lewis' casket lay in state at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Monday. His casket is scheduled to lie in state at the Georgia Capitol on Wednesday, followed by a funeral service in Atlanta on Thursday.
   
 Williams, who currently chairs the Democratic Party of Georgia, has touted her background as an activist and tested lawmaker, casting herself in the mold of Lewis as a fighter who will push for voting rights. She was elected to the Georgia Senate in 2017.
   
 The 39th District state Senate seat Williams held will also require a special election to pick a Democratic nominee to replace her on the Nov. 3 ballot. That contest will decide the seat since no Republican nominee is on the ballot.

The surge in the Midwest has been fueled largely by a rise in cases among young adults, who have been hitting bars, restaurants and health clubs again.
 Florida reported 191 new deaths, another one-day high for the state, while Arizona recorded 104, and Arkansas had a single-day record with 20.
 The virus is blamed for approximately 4.3 million confirmed infections and about 150,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Globally, more than 16.5 million people have been infected, and more than 655,000 have died.
 Republican governors in Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina have all resisted calls to close bars and gyms or issue statewide mask requirements, though local officials have imposed some of their own restrictions.
 In Mississippi, nine of the state’s biggest hospitals had no open intensive care beds as of Monday, and officials are considering opening pop-up facilities to provide more space. More than 24% of coronavirus tests have come back positive in Mississippi over the past week, the highest rate in the nation and triple the national average.
 Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has gone so far as to argue that because mask-wearing has become political, a statewide mandate could actually discourage people from covering their faces. Instead, he is requiring masks only in the most seriously stricken counties.
 Terry Sullivan, general manager of Fondren Fitness in Jackson, said a statewide requirement would be “the right thing to do.”
 “I know it’s a hot topic, but if we can all just wear masks and really do right for a month, it would help a lot to try and slow this down in Mississippi,” he said. “If we don’t, it’s not going to slow down.”
 In Missouri, larger cities are growing rattled by a spike in cases after the state fully reopened. The state reported another single-day record increase in cases, with nearly 1,800. St. Louis is curtailing bar hours and reducing restaurant seating capacity starting Friday, and Kansas City may follow suit.
 GOP Gov. Mike Parson has repeatedly refused to enact a statewide order requiring masks, citing relatively few cases in most of the state compared with hot spots in bigger cities.
 Parson said last month that he didn’t believe the governor has personal responsibility for any virus, and compared the illness that has killed almost 1,000 people in his state to the flu. He said no one would expect him to take responsibility if someone were involved in an accident on a Missouri road.
 The uncertainty has put restaurant owners in a difficult position.
 Brian Schmitz, co-owner of The Bellwether and the Polite Society in St. Louis, closed the two restaurants temporarily after a guest expressed concerns Sunday that another diner recently made a social media post about testing positive for COVID-19. Schmitz said that the buildings have been deep cleaned and that he is testing staff before reopening, and it is proving costly.

Last week I was driving down Main Street at the border between Springerville and Eager when the most amazing thing happened.
 I was carefully doing 35 m.p.h. when a large silver horse trailer suddenly shot out into the street under its own power in front of me. There was no pickup truck connected to it. It was just a rogue trailer driving itself into traffic, something that could be very dangerous but this time it was quite hilarious.
 I admit that I have never before see a horse trailer traveling on its own and the thing was actually quite graceful as it consumed the four lanes of Main Street.
 I quickly slowed my car and maneuvered to block the road, turning my 4-way flashers on in the process.
 All of the traffic on Main Street in Springerville came to a quick halt.
 I sat there for a moment thinking I could just drive around it, but thought, “what if it were me in this situation.”
 I got out and walked over to the trailer to see what help I possibly could be. I had major surgery two months ago and can’t do any heavy lifting right now. As I approached the large silver trailer, I wasn’t alone.
 A small army of men were there in an instant to help.
 I finally saw the owner of the trailer as he parked his pickup in the middle of the four-lane road.
 I asked him, “What did you do?” He answered jokingly, “I’m not sure.”
 One of the men said, “This thing it too heavy to just lift up,” while another man shouted, “What if a few of us got on the back and made the tongue lighter.”
 Well I can do that, so I and four other guys quickly became ballast on the back of the trailer as the rest of the army picked up the tongue of the large trailer and rolled it backwards into a parking lot.
 We stood there a few seconds to admire the accomplishment, but everyone realized that the road was still blocked by our vehicles.

 Georgia Democratic Party leaders last week picked state Sen. Nikema Williams, D-Atlanta, to replace Lewis on the Nov. 3 ballot after the longtime congressman won the primary in June. She faces Republican Angela Stanton King.
 Lewis, a prominent civil rights leader who was beaten by police in Selma, Ala., during a protest march in 1965, served 33 years in Congress before his death at age 80 following a seven-month battle with pancreatic cancer.
 He was poised to defend his seat for an 18th consecutive term prior to his death on July 17, which sparked a complicated and quick-moving process for state Democrats to pick his replacement to square off against King rather than let Republicans claim the reliably blue district.
 Kemp, a Republican, announced the Sept. 29 special election as Lewis' casket lay in state at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Monday. His casket is scheduled to lie in state at the Georgia Capitol on Wednesday, followed by a funeral service in Atlanta on Thursday.
 Williams, who currently chairs the Democratic Party of Georgia, has touted her background as an activist and tested lawmaker, casting herself in the mold of Lewis as a fighter who will push for voting rights. She was elected to the Georgia Senate in 2017.
 The 39th District state Senate seat Williams held will also require a special election to pick a Democratic nominee to replace her on the Nov. 3 ballot. That contest will decide the seat since no Republican nominee is on the ballot.
