The faces run the gamut of color, expression and texture. Sometimes they're angry, full of scratchy lines, and sometimes they're happy, almost delusional, with rainbow colors and swirled lines. They can also be confused, or sad, and sometimes they're worried — as the faces painted in early March were — and sometimes they're optimistic. Sometimes they have three eyes, or none at all; all of the faces seem happy to be seen.⁣

The proposed inflatable water park would be situated in the bay off of Amherst Avenue on a private water lot purchased by the water park owner, according to city’s zoning officer, Roger McLarnon.
 The operators have obtained approval from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, but have yet to submit an application to the city’s planning board, McLarnon said. Although the water park would be situated on private property, landward access will be used to get to the park.
 “Once they use bulkhead to cross into the water it has to go to the planning board,” he said. “They want to get up and running by the summer so I imagine an application would be submitted soon.”
 The water park operators could not be reached for comment.
 “There seems to be a lot of excitement for it,” McLarnon said. “We’re always looking for different ways for families to stay in Margate, and visitors. Plus it’s something to do for the kids. We want the waterfront activity to generate activity down there.”

At No. 7 in the world, he’s the highest-ranked player not to have won a major. A recent run of seven consecutive top-8 finishes included his sixth PGA Tour title at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in July. But he missed the cut in the game’s toughest test since golf returned from a COVID-induced break at the U.S. Open-like setup at the Memorial. And in 12 majors since turning pro, he has yet to have a top 10, with a tie for 15th in the 2016 U.S. Open his best finish.

Being selfless and having an innate sense of right and wrong is a quality many heroes have. Think of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert Kennedy Jr. One was a seamstress, one was a minister’s son, and the other, the son of a multi-millionaire. These three people from such different backgrounds changed American history by being selfless and knowing right from wrong. It was wrong for people to have to sit on the back of a bus because of the color of their skin and it was wrong for them to not have the same rights and privileges of every person. Parks, King, and Kennedy were at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement that showed society the consequences of such bigotry, and educated society on knowing the obvious “right from wrong.”

If you’re data driven, there’s good research that illustrates that diverse teams are stronger teams. If you’re anecdote driven, here’s a simple illustration: When I started working on the sales floor, I was required to wear a uniform, like everyone else. I’m kind of a small person, so I ordered the smallest uniform size I could — a Men’s Medium. It looked ridiculous on me. Well, see, diverse uniform sizes never really occurred to anyone on the leadership team, because they were all men at that point, and they were all average sizes. But wearing an ill-fitting uniform shirt every day — for years and years as some of our folks had done — is irritating. It’s more than irritating, actually. It is disrespectful and discourteous to our team. Now apply that same logic to work from home policies, family leave policies, market strategies, and company culture…different perspectives, if you’re willing to slow down and listen to each other on the important two-way street of understanding, make us stronger, more relevant, more honoring of others, and more successful.

 Bing said diversity within police departments is also important and a good beginning but does not make a clear difference as the problems are embedded in the police culture and unions.
 President Donald Trump signed the Safe Policing for Safe Communities executive order on June 16, which called for the increase in capacity for social workers and mental health professionals to work directly with police officers to address situations involving individuals with mental health, homelessness and addiction issues.
 The idea is that social workers are better trained to de-escalate situations, but the reality is police officers are also trained in de-escalation, Cobb said. Both organizations need more training in dealing with racial and ethnic minorities.
 He said people often associate social work as for social justice, but historically social work has maintained a social order perpetuating racial and ethnic minorities.
 The field of social work has a long way to go in ridding itself of the main barrier to Black liberation, that barrier being white supremacy, said Maxine Davis, School of Social Work assistant professor, in an email.
 “For far too long we have tried to work within the system—it’s time to upend the system as we know it,” Davis said.

The PRSA is an important organization that represents more than 20,000 members in the PR profession and 10,000 student members.
 Founded in 1947, it operates via a national organization HQ-ed in New York City and 110 chapters across the U.S., as well as almost 375 university and college campuses through the PRSSA.
 I’ve visited and presented at many local chapters over the years from Richmond, VA to Silicon Valley to Columbus, OH to Detroit, MI and have had universally excellent experiences and enjoyed engaging with PR professionals across the country.
 The trade association does a lot of good work and helps PR professionals prosper in their jobs and is a great networking forum. It benefits from the unpaid work of hundreds of volunteers, both at the national and local leadership levels.
 Some of those unpaid volunteers end up being the butt of those who are dissatisfied with the organization and, however much you may think they’re not doing a good enough job, it’s hard not to feel just a little bit sorry for them given the abuse sometimes directed their way.
 But there's no doubt in recent years some of the mood music around the PRSA has turned negative and the organization now finds itself at pivotal moment in its evolution.
 Two years ago, the association faced justified opprobrium when it launched a social media activation called “Which PR princess are you?” that seemed so out of touch with modern communications and PR professionals as to be almost unbelievable. Many women in the industry understandably found it derogatory.
 There is continuing discussion about the requirement to have an APR qualification to serve on the board of the PRSA, when fewer PR pros deem that qualification necessary to practice in the profession.
 And, in the past year especially, like many other enterprises and organizations, it has also drawn criticism for a lack of diversity in its leadership.
 The association has been without a CEO for over a year now, when the incumbent Joe Truncale departed the role in July 2019, having already given notice of his plans to step down. PRSA CFO Phil Bonaventura took over Truncale's CEO duties on an interim basis and continues to cover the vacancy.
 Neither Truncale nor Bonaventura adopted particularly public roles in terms of fronting the organization, preferring to leave the spotlight to the volunteer chairs of the association, ranging from Debra Peterson last year to Garland Stansell this year and chair-elect for 2021, Michelle Olson.
 Previous incumbent CEO Bill Murray resigned in March 2014 after seven years in the top role. Murray was more comfortable in being a front person and frequently led media responses on PRSA issues and other PR industry matters.
 He stayed on until June to help with the transition and Truncale’s appointment was announced in October that year. It was a fairly smooth and timely transition.
 The quest to find Truncale’s replacement started in December 2018 and ramped up in Q1 2019 when recruitment firm Russell Reynolds was appointed to lead the search. My understanding is that 12 candidates were interviewed via telephone in the summer with six subsequently attending in-person interviews.
 Two of the six progressed to second interviews in September, with a view to making an appointment prior to the PRSA’s big annual conference in San Diego that October. Unfortunately, negotiations with one of the candidates fell through and it was decided not to progress the other candidacy.
 The search was then put on hold until the New Year when more people are looking for jobs and was picked up again in February. COVID-19 hit in March further delayed it and, before we know it, we are back to a situation where interviews are planned for September with a view to having the new CEO announced by the time of this year’s (virtual) conference in October.
 As I stated earlier, this process is being conducted by volunteers and fate and circumstances seem to have conspired against them, but, by any standards, the CEO recruitment process can best be described as tortuous. After all, this is a very well paid job we’re talking about that should be an attractive proposition for a talented leader.
 My sense is that there has been too much focus on infighting, tension between some chapters and the national organization, and not enough attention on advancing the profession of PR.
 Members want to see more progress and leadership on diversity and inclusion. It was curious, for example, that the PRSA’s refreshed diversity pledge – allied with an admission that the body’s leadership and membership was not sufficiently diverse – was released late in the day on the Thursday before the July 4 holiday weekend, a notorious dead spot in the news calendar not designed to garner maximum attention.
 In the PRSSA, the trade association has a jewel in the crown that acts as a platform for young leaders to develop and should be a fantastic platform and pipeline of new talent into the PRSA.
 As the PRSA gears up for its first virtual ICON conference on October 26-29, it is to be hoped there will be a new CEO appointed by then who can grab hold of the challenges ahead and lead the association.
 Some members may never be happy with the direction in which the body is traveling, but it needs a strong hand on the tiller with a well-defined strategy to unleash its undoubted potential.

The report said: “Shortly after the take-off roll was commenced it was rejected, due to a contained failure of the left engine, and the aircraft was brought to a stop on the runway.
 “Just as the flight crew were about to taxi the aircraft off the runway, an evacuation was commanded by the Senior Flight Attendant.
 “The investigation identified several factors that contributed to this decision.”
 The Senior Flight Attendant told investigators she had little contact with the cockpit and there had been confusion with her fellow stewards after the engine failed.
 The noise of it had been “very loud” and had scared her, a fellow steward had reported seeing flames and sparks coming from the engine and she had not heard the pilot order cabin crew to their positions.
 Confusion grew as they attempted to communicate using a combination of the interphone, hand signals in poor light, and the PA system.
 A handset had become tangled in a seat, further complicating communication, and she ordered the evacuation.
 The report said the evacuation was hampered by passengers trying to retrieve their luggage from overhead lockers or trying to escape while holding it.
 Following the incident the operator had taken several safety actions, principally around the training of its flight attendants, the report said.
 Two Safety Recommendations regarding evacuation and how to prevent passengers from obstructing them by retrieving carry-on baggage were also made in the report.

My first kitchen job involved making six gallons of gazpacho every Sunday. This was back when earning your chops meant something, and making that whole batch with just a knife and peeler, no blender, was the most tedious task on my list. It was also the most popular dish on the menu. By the time I'd learned that recipe -- straight out of the "Moosewood Cookbook" -- by heart, I figured I knew everything there was to know about cold Spanish soups.      When I finally made it to Spain, reality set in on many levels. Sangria, it turns out, is just for tourists, while the locals drink a mix of red wine and Sprite called tinto de verano.      Spanish gazpacho, meanwhile, is a lot smoother than my chunky hippie version. And because it's so involved to make, with an entire garden's worth of vegetables to prepare, gazpacho is often reserved for special occasions like Sundays or when company comes over. When the average Spaniard wants to whip up a quick cold soup at home, or have a chilled bowl at the local bar, it's much more likely to be salmorejo.   Just tomatoes, garlic, oil, vinegar, salt and bread crumbs, a much pared-down cast compared to gazpacho, in salmorejo we are free to focus all of our attention on the tomato.      It has a creamy red look, and a body that jiggles like sea foam thanks to the emulsion among tomato, oil and vinegar, and thickened by the tomato-soaked bread. Some recipes call for the "guts" of a baguette; I've also had good luck cutting the edges off a slice of bread -- usually white but whole grain adds a fun heartiness once in a while.      High-acid, normal-looking red tomatoes are traditionally used, but some of my best batches have been mutts, medleys of whatever heirlooms, slicers, cherry and paste tomatoes are getting too soft for salad.      I was in Spain when COVID-19 hit. On the last afternoon before the lockdown, it didn't quite seem real. In Lanjaron, a cute mountain village in Andalusia, it was business and leisure as usual. As my kids enjoyed a playground that would be roped off for months the very next morning, I ducked into a cafe just ahead of a tour bus from Madrid, and ordered a bowl of salmorejo. It came out immediately, garnished with chopped hard boiled egg and jamon -- Spanish cured ham.      I didn't realize it at the time, but that typical bowl of everyday salmorejo would be my last taste of normalcy for months, not to mention my last restaurant meal. Cooped in our rented house during the lockdown, I began to understand the wisdom of keeping a pitcher of salmorejo in the fridge. It was as much an act of preparation for the inevitable heat of the day as a response to the ever-accumulating soft tomatoes and stale bread, one problem solving another.      Here is a boilerplate salmorejo recipe. Tweak it to suit your own whims and tastes -- but only adjust the levels of the called-for ingredients. If you start adding things, you'll have bready gazpacho in no time.      Salmorejo   Serves 4   • 2 pounds tomatoes   • 1/2 cup "bread guts" -- roughly a slice of bread with the crust cut off   • 1 modest sized clove garlic, chopped   • 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar (more to taste if your tomatoes are low-acid)   • ½ teaspoon salt + more to taste   • ½ cup extra virgin olive oil   • Garnish: hard boiled egg, chopped ham, olive oil, parsley, chives      Boil a pot of salted water deep enough to submerge your tomatoes.      While the water heats, cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato to slice the skins. Then chop the bread.      Boil the tomatoes in the water for about 2 minutes, then immediately plunge them into an ice bath until they are completely cool. Remove the tomatoes and pull off the skins. If you want to go the extra mile, cut open the tomatoes and remove the seeds. (And if you want to slack, you can skip peeling the tomatoes).      Liquify the tomatoes in a blender for about 30 seconds. Add the bread and liquify again. Let the blended bread sit for about 5 minutes in the blended tomatoes.      Add the garlic, salt, vinegar and oil. Blend on high for a minute. Check seasonings; blend again if you made any adjustments.      Chill. Garnish with chopped hard boiled egg and jamon if you want to be traditional. More casually, a simple splash of olive oil or sprinkle of fresh parsley will complete the dish.

The service mesh has quickly become a vital part of the modern cloud native computing stack, as it essentially enables communication, monitoring, and load balancing between disparate parts of today’s microservices-based architecture.
 This differs from the popular container orchestration service Kubernetes in its level of granularity. When run in tandem with Kubernetes, a service mesh enables deeper security policy and encryption enforcement and automated load balancing and circuit breaking functionality.

So, I don't have like a 1-to-1 relationship with it like that. And often what's interesting is that you can't even tell for five years if a movie actually is good and has stood the test of time. That's really when you know is if people are still watching it and talking about it and enjoying it, but in general, no, honestly, I am still slightly traumatized by some experiences that I've had with my movies just being trashed. And that has nothing to do with the Marc Maron stuff. Like that, I'm okay with. If I say something, and everyone loses their minds because of it, then that's par for the course for me and something that I never complain about. Not that I'm complaining about this, but that doesn't weigh on me as much as my work being viewed as good or bad.

Two new opinion polls declared on Thursday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party would lose its electoral prowess should another election be held in Israel now.
 Conducted by the Kan Public broadcaster, as well as Channel 13 News, the surveys concluded that the far-right Yamina alliance would enjoy a significant increase in its vote share at the expense of Netanyahu's Likud.
 Speaking to TRT World, Selim Han Yeniacun, an expert on Israeli politics, said in light of the far-right's sudden rise and its current centre stage prominence in Israeli politics, it is becoming clear that neither Netanyahu, nor his rival-turned-ally, Benny Gantz's political visions have resonated with many right-leaning voters
 "In case of evaluating the issue from right wing parties' aspect, Israel is not having good times because of its protective and security based politics," said Yehiacun, who has authored two books on the Palestine-Israel conflict in Turkish.
 "Amid the pandemic, Netanyahu failed to realise its occupation plan of Palestinian lands and disappointed his supporters. Besides, his alliance with Benny Gantz who was accused by him of not loving Israel for a year also disappointed the right-wing".
 As the polls suggest, the rightwing Haredi bloc would gain the majority in Knesset by having 63 seats, while the centre-left bloc would take 49, and Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu will have eight, according to the Channel 13 poll.
 Public broadcaster Kan also gave the highest seat tally of 62 to the far-right and 51 to the centre-left. Like Channel 13, Kan also gave eight seats to Yisrael Beiteinu.
 Both polls resulted in giving Prime Minister Netanyahu's Likud a decisive lead. Likud gets 29 seats according to Channel 13, and 30 as per Kan's poll. Led by the former Defence Minister, Naftali Bennett, the Yamina party which previously won seven seats in Knesset, would increase the number of its seats by 12 - this according to Channel 13's poll and 8 according to Kan.
 A Turkish expert on Israel, Yeniacun, said the new alternatives -- referring to the right-wing parties -- have a potential to increase their votes because of Netanyahu and Gantz's recent activities.
 "The representatives of the 'New Right', by taking its previous name 'Yamina' known as extremist right bloc will increase its votes seriously," explains Yeniacun.
 In May, Yamina was quick to announce that the party refused to join the governing coalition, calling it a "left-wing government headed by Netanyahu." The party's statement said that it was preparing for "the day after Netanyahu."
 On the other hand, according to Yeniacun, Netanyahu is not the only one who has been seriously wounded. Benny Gantz, who destroyed the Blue and White bloc for the sake of allying with Netanyahu, has been, too.
 "Despite his assertive election campaign promises, he has a dim performance in politics. In addition, it's uncertain how he will perform when he takes over the prime ministry position after two years," says Yeniacun.
 When it comes to Gantz's current position in Israeli politics, Channel 13's poll suggests that Yesh Atid-Telem, a faction which broke away from Kahol Lavan after its party leader, Benny Gantz, decided to join a coalition alongside Netanyahu, also received 19 seats. According to Kan's poll, the party is ahead of Yamina, with 17 seats.
 Both of the polls concluded that the Joint List of Arab-majority parties remains in third position, and according to Channel 13's survey, the Joint List is projected to have 15 seats, while Kan's poll suggests 16.
 Current Defence Minister Benny Gantz's Kahol Lavan, which won 33 seats in the elections in March, also dropped below its former partners by gaining 8 projected seats from Channel 13 and 12 from Kan.
 Channel 13's survey was led by Professor Camil Fuchs by looking at the results from 704 respondents. Among them, 604 were Jewish and 100 were Arab - there was a reported margin of error of 3.9 percent.
 The Kan poll was conducted online and by the Kantar Group, and it surveyed a sample representative of the adult population of Israel. It included 559 respondents, with a margin of error of 4.4 percent.

Either Ivan Perisic or Philippe Coutinho is set to start for Bayern Munich in Saturday's Champions League clash against injury-hit Chelsea with the Germans' head coach Hansi Flick demanding full focus despite a comfortable cushion.
 Bayern host Frank Lampard's Chelsea at the Allianz Arena in the last 16, return leg holding a 3-0 advantage after routing the Blues at Stamford Bridge last February before the competition was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Bayern face a depleted Chelsea side missing captain Cesar Azpilicueta, plus wingers Christian Pulisic and Pedro, who were injured in Saturday's FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal.
 With Kingsley Coman out injured, Flick is mulling starting Brazilian Coutinho, on loan from Barcelona, or Croatia winger Perisic, loaned by Inter Milan, on the wing.
 "Perisic is a little more dynamic in attack, but Coutinho is better on the ball and can play in more positions, such as a number 10 off (Robert) Lewandowski," said Flick, saying he has yet to decide.
 Bayern striker Lewandowski, who scored in the first leg in London, has 51 goals this season and is the Champions League's top scorer with 11 goals in six games.
 Former Liverpool star Coutinho is set to return to Barcelona once his one-year loan deal expires when Bayern's Champions League campaign ends, but is in form after recovering from an ankle injury.
 "Philippe is currently in very good shape. I like him very much as a footballer and a person, so I am happy that he is now fit and physically at a high level," said Flick.
 "He always scores and can give the decisive pass. I like the way he interprets football."
 The hosts are overwhelming favourites to reach the quarter-finals, where they would face Barcelona or Napoli in Lisbon next Friday, but Flick is demanding his side give their all against Chelsea.
 "It's about having respect, we have seen how Chelsea performed after the restart," Flick added with the Blues having won nine of their 12 games.
 "We also need to focus on our own strengths," he added.
 Bayern are on a 12-match winning streak, including last Friday's 1-0 friendly win over Marseille.

The WTW Cinemas group has pioneered the way forward while other cinemas remain closed in Cornwall and even multiplexes further afield still haven’t opened.
 It’s not easy for them – they’re only allowed 35% capacity and are hampered by a lack of new releases. Studio fears are leading to the likes of Disney announcing that a new release such as Mulan will go straight to online streaming, which will have a catastrophic effect on cinemas, dependent on those big blockbusters.
 It’s not just about those headline films though, and that’s why we should be supporting the smaller, more interesting, offerings like Make Up and Summerland, which are both showing at The Plaza this week.
 The former has garnered the sort of glowing five-star reviews rare for such an intimate and low-key film – The Telegraph dubbed it the best British film of 2020.
 It’s easy to see why – it’s an unsettling, slightly sinister coming-of-age tale set on a desolate out-of-season caravan park in St Ives.
 This is the other side of Cornwall those of us who live here know only too well. Windblown, insular and depressing.

If I am making time to be in the field and learning more and more, a by product is that I will not spend time doing other things that are less meaningful to my team or our business. Are you surprised by how many different ways we can distract ourselves with conferences, mixers, webinars, roundtables, books from people we don’t really know and aren’t vetted, podcasts, etc. instead of being better students of our own business? We can start believing we’re missing out if we don’t listen/attend/read all those things. Another by product of being in the field more is that it reinvigorates me about why we’re in business at all. I love the people of McCoy’s! I love our customers! I love that we’re a part of the supply chain of housing, community building, homemaking, and ranching. But if I don’t spend time with all the people connected to our business, listening to their stories of life and work, I’ll be distracted and start elevating my own ideas, my own reputation, my own image…and then forget it. I’ll end up more miserable (because that race isn’t really that much fun), and our team won’t be heard.

I grew up outside of Chicago with two successful, hardworking parents. My mother is a Behavioral/Cognitive Neuroscientist and Speech Pathologist and was somewhat of a workaholic when I was growing up. That instilled in me the importance of women having careers. I always had a passion around women’s issues and was a bit of a feminist on the playground. Later, at NYU I took a lot of women’s study courses. When I found my way to WPO it was because I liked the idea of women being in business, but I had zero interest in the business itself. The love of business developed as I worked in this role and understood the impact that women-owned and led businesses had on the economy. Then I went on to get an MBA.

One of the unexpected ways I tried to cope? Overspending. I found myself clicking on Instagram ads as I mindlessly scrolled through my feed. And not only did I click on them, I actually made purchases! I signed up for subscription boxes on a whim. I’d get marketing emails from retailers in my inbox and think, “that’s a great deal, I definitely need that” (even though I didn’t). And don’t get me started on ordering from Seamless when we had a fridge full of food. Now, who doesn’t love to shop for a fun new item or splurge on a decadent treat once in a while? But my habit was turning into a daily activity, and it was adding up.

Beijing. [EFE]. TikTok, la red social de China vetada por razones de seguridad nacional en Estados Unidos, aseguró este viernes que hará todo lo posible para revertir esa decisión y que, si Washington se niega a hacerlo, acudirá a la justicia estadounidense. En un comunicado publicado en su página web, TikTok asegura sentirse “sorprendida” por la orden ejecutiva firmada ayer por el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, por la que prohíbe cualquier transacción con su desarrollador, la tecnológica china ByteDance. ”Emplearemos todos los recursos (legales) de los que dispongamos para garantizar que no se desecha el Estado de derecho (...), si no es con la Administración, será con los tribunales de Estados Unidos”, afirma la nota. La red social, que cuenta con unos 100 millones de usuarios en el país norteamericano, considera que no se han respetado los procedimientos debidos ni se ha respetado la ley, y que el gobierno de Estados Unidos nunca se ha prestado a buscar una “solución constructiva”. TikTok denuncia que en la orden de Trump se habla de informaciones que no son citadas y de temores de que la aplicación “pueda ser utilizada” para campañas de desinformación. Asimismo, asevera que los datos de los usuarios que recaba entran dentro del “estándar de la industria para miles de aplicaciones móviles en todo el mundo”. La red social insiste en que nunca ha compartido datos con el gobierno chino y que tampoco ha censurado contenidos a petición de Beijing. ”Incluso hemos expresado nuestra disposición de pactar una venta completa de nuestros negocios en Estados Unidos a una compañía estadounidense”, agrega la plataforma, en referencia a las negociaciones abiertas con Microsoft que, de cerrarse, podrían permitirle seguir activa en el país norteamericano, donde goza de gran popularidad. En el comunicado, TikTok asegura que la decisión de vetarla “crea un precedente peligroso para el concepto de libertad de expresión” y pide a sus usuarios que ejerzan “su derecho a ser escuchados” contactando con sus representantes políticos e incluso con la Casa Blanca para mostrar su oposición a la medida. Mientras tanto, Beijing aseguró hoy que el veto a TikTok (Trump también firmó uno en términos similares contra WeChat, el “WhatsApp chino”) es un “desvergonzado acto de hegemonía” por parte de Washington. El portavoz de la cancillería china Wang Wenbin dijo que China protegerá los derechos e intereses de sus empresas y que Estados Unidos “deberá asumir las consecuencias de sus acciones”, aunque no especificó detalles sobre posibles represalias.

I think of a hero as being loyal, determined, having an innate sense of right and wrong, being selfless, and being a fighter. Loyalty is a prized quality in all of us, at least it should be. It’s relatively easy to be loyal to your family and close circle of friends. However, it’s much more difficult and sacrificing to be loyal to a cause or a principal. An example we encountered when we started out in business was finding a supplier who would provide us with great service and prices even though we were a startup and couldn’t commit to a large volume of production. Our manufacturer did just that. He gave us great service and prices because he had faith in us. As we grew, competitive manufacturers reached out to us and offered us better pricing than we currently have. We didn’t even consider them because to us, our manufacturer really was a “hero” and was loyal to our needs, and we certainly reciprocated that loyalty. It wasn’t a difficult decision because we were loyal to the principle of being there for those who have been there for us when it wasn’t easy.
