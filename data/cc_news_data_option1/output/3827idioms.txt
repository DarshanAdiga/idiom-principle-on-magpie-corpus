Robert Zemeckis' "Forrest Gump" is a six-time Oscar winner (including trophies for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor) and $683 million grosser (the second biggest release of 1994 after "The Lion King"), but Paramount wasn't so confident about the film's success during production. During a new interview on "In Depth with Graham Bensinger," Tom Hanks revealed that he paid out of pocket for at least two "Forrest Gump" scenes after the studio refused to put down the money itself and increase the budget. One of the scenes was Forrest's iconic run across America.

The committee first recommended that an ordinance be drafted in June, following a request from a group known as Concerned East Side Neighbors. The neighbors had been working for several years to research social host ordinances after many of them experienced loud house parties near their homes.
 As drafted, the ordinance would require the hosts of social gatherings to ensure that noise stays under control, that any alcohol is consumed in accordance with existing laws and to make sure roads and driveways are not blocked. It also authorizes police officers to require that guests at a party vacate the premises if the officer determines that a gathering violates the ordinance.
 The draft includes a four-tier penalty system. A written warning would be issued for the first offense, a $300 fine is possible for the second offense, $500 for the third offense and $1,000 for each subsequent offense. Penalties would be served upon the hosts, with the exception of the $300 fine, which could also be levied against individuals at unruly gatherings if they ignore a verbal warning.
 Penalties are cumulative, meaning that if an officer issues a written warning, but later that night is called back to the same unruly gathering, a fine can then be issued. However, the sequence of fines resets one year after the written warning is issued.
 Additionally, if a warning or fine is issued to the resident of a rental property, the police would be required under the draft ordinance to notify the landlord of that property within three days.
 “This is an excellent first swing at this,” Councilor Mitch Greenwald said. As someone who owns several rental properties around town, he said he feels the draft is fair to landlords.

 # Construction on MSUFCU's office in downtown East Lansing could start in November
 Megan Banta
 Lansing State Journal
 EAST LANSING – Construction could start on a downtown East Lansing Michigan State University Federal Credit Union branch in less than two months.
 East Lansing City Council unanimously approved a site plan Tuesday night, giving the credit union the green light to start work after it purchases a city lot for $810,000.
 MSUFCU is set to transform that lot, at the northwest corner of Abbot Road and Albert Avenue, into a seven-story, nearly 105-foot tall building with a credit union branch, office space and a community space.
 The first floor will have a branch and commercial space. April Clobes, who heads MSUFCU, said they're in discussions with potential tenants for the extra space.
 The second floor will have a community space that can fit up to 499 people.
 That space will be free for community members and organizations to use for conferences, training sessions, financial seminars, group meetings and MSUFCU- sponsored events. The credit union doesn't intend for it to be used for small parties, one-on-one meetings or personal or for-profit events.
 The remaining floors will house MSUFCU's intern center as well as office space for the credit union and potentially for other companies.
 Both city officials and MSUFCU leadership are excited for the project, which they say will support economic development and job growth, especially downtown.
 Jessy Gregg, a councilmember who serves as mayor pro tem, owns Seams Fabric downtown and is "pretty gung-ho" about the project.
 Having the credit union branch and office space downtown will help achieve officials' vision of a livable, walkable downtown by adding to the services available in the area.
 "When we have a concentration of high-density residents downtown, we’re hoping that they would then do their banking there similarly to doing their grocery shopping at the Target," Gregg said.
 A permanent office space will also provide year-round customers for businesses that currently face a three-month gap in regular business when Michigan State University students are on summer break.
 The space is also something residents have wanted for a long time but that developers haven't offered until now, Mayor Aaron Stephens said.
 "Two years ago, when I got elected to council, having office space in our downtown wasn’t a conversation," Stephens said. "It just wasn’t."
 He's happy MSUFCU was willing to take the first step and thinks the office space will help businesses in the downtown and will "continue the work on creating an atmosphere that we want to see."
 MSUFCU and the firms the credit union is working with on the project are still working to finalize construction documents.
 Their goal, according to the site plan application, is to ask for a first set of bids and award a contract in October.
 After about two weeks of environmental remediation, they then propose to start construction around Nov. 16.
 The proposed construction schedule has work wrapping up at the end of March 2022.

Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the most senior Democrat in Washington, said on Thursday that "justice was denied for Breonna Taylor and her family".
 Senator Kamala Harris, who is running for vice-president with Joe Biden, wrote on Twitter that American must "keep speaking Breonna Taylor's name".
 ## What were the circumstances of Ms Taylor's killing?
 Plainclothes police, executing a search warrant, forced their way into the apartment where Breonna Taylor was in bed with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, shortly after midnight.
 Mr Walker fired a shot from his licensed gun, later telling police he thought that Ms Taylor's ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, had broken in, according to the New York Times.
 Officials say Mr Walker's bullet struck Mr Mattingly in the leg. The three officers returned fire, discharging 32 rounds, according to a ballistics report from the FBI.
 Ms Taylor was shot amid the commotion and died on the hallway floor.
 No drugs were found at the property, though Jefferson County Prosecutor Thomas Wine said the search was cancelled after the shooting.

While committee members seemed pleased with the draft, they were not without questions or suggestions for improvement. Greenwald asked whether a complaint is required for a police officer to intervene in an unruly gathering or whether they could choose to step in if they saw a party they believed violated the ordinance while on patrol.
 Greenwald also asked about how police would keep track of the violations. City Manager Elizabeth Dragon said the Keene Police Department has a system for tracking violations, but said that system would need some changes before it’s capable of keeping up with the requirements of the proposed new ordinance.
 The committee also took questions and comments from a couple of community members who expressed support for the city’s efforts.
 Committee Chairwoman Kate Bosley, in response to a question from a member of the public, noted that she would like the ordinance to specify that warnings and fines follow the people who are issued them and are not attached to the property, so that future residents don’t pay for the actions of previous occupants. Mullins agreed and said he would keep that in mind while working on the next draft.
 Keene State College President Melinda Treadwell said the college has been working with community stakeholders to see what steps it can take to help curb rowdy parties. She said she feels the draft social host ordinance will help to advance Keene State’s commitment to being a good neighbor.
 One resident, Pete Moran, raised a few questions, including one about the singular use of the word “host” rather than the plural. He asked how “host” would be defined in the event that there are multiple names on a deed or lease and how many individuals would be fined for the same party.
 Mullins said this is something he would give some additional thought to. He plans to prepare a new draft of the ordinance for the committee to examine at its next meeting on Oct. 7.
 Still, Moran, a member of the Concerned East Side Neighbors group, said the draft does a good job of doing what it is meant to do.
 “At the end of the day, the ultimate issue was to get to the root of the problem,” he said. “And I think this really does that."

Amazon today revealed Luna, its cloud-gaming platform and the latest competitor to xCloud and Stadia. It goes live in early access this October, and sign-ups to receive an invite are available now (US only at the moment). Luna will support Fire TV, PC, Mac and iOS devices at first in early access, with Android support coming just "weeks" later, Luna head Marc Whitten told Engadget.Alongside the software, Amazon built a low-latency, Alexa- enabled Luna controller, and it'll be available for $49.99 during early access. Instead of communicating with the screen like a traditional Bluetooth controller, the Luna gamepad connects directly to the cloud, a move that Amazon says minimizes latency by 20 to 30 milliseconds. (This is reminiscent of the technology behind Google's Stadia controller.) Bluetooth gamepads will function with Luna as well. The controller also features an Alexa button, which, when held down, allows users to boot up specific games via voice commands. Amazon With Luna, Amazon is targeting cloud gaming at up to 4K and 60fps, though initially, the service will be capped at 1080p and 60fps, Luna head of engineering and technology George Tsipolitis said. Amazon recommends internet speeds of 10 Mbps for 1080p, or 35 Mbps for 4K.Luna is a subscription service, though it's not exactly a one-stop shopping experience. Access to the baseline Luna experience, Luna+, is $5.99 a month, and this channel will feature a broad selection of games from various developers. By the end of early access, Amazon is aiming to have around 50 games in Luna+, including Control, Resident Evil 7, Tacoma, Metro Exodus and The Sexy Brutale.Subscribers will have the option to pay more for additional channels, each of which will support curated or publisher-specific games. The first publisher on the Luna train is Ubisoft, and its channel will have around 50 games in early access, including same-day releases of upcoming titles like Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Far Cry 6 and Immortals Fenyx Rising.Between Luna+ and the Ubisoft channel, Luna is on track to support more than 100 games by the end of early access."So more than Stadia, less than Game Pass," Luna business development manager Lisa Schwenke said. Microsoft recently added xCloud to its Game Pass Ultimate subscription service, offering more than 150 streamable titles. Stadia has about 50, some of which are purchased individually.Schwenke continued, "The goal is to continue to have something for everyone, see what customers are enjoying and try to bring more of that. So definitely starting out a little bit smaller during early access."There's also Twitch integration in Luna -- after all, we are talking about Amazon here. On day one in early access, Luna subscribers will see videos on individual game pages showcasing streamers playing that title, and clicking on one will start Twitch. On Twitch, if a streamer is playing a game in the Luna library, viewers will be able to click a link and start playing it via Luna themselves, as long as they're a paid member of Amazon's cloud gaming service.These are similar to YouTube-connected social features that Google outlined at the launch of Stadia, though they're still missing from that particular platform. Amazon Though Luna will be available on iPhones and iPads from day one, it's not a native iOS app. Luna is a progressive web application, meaning it's technically a browser-based program that only looks like a standard app. With Luna as a PWA, Amazon is bypassing Apple's App Store rules and fees -- again. For more on Luna and what it means to be a PWA amid a flurry of mobile antitrust lawsuits, read our additional coverage here.

“Another group of white classmates mocked slavery and pretended to whip each other,” he added. "These were two very public events. I didn’t want to be part of a campus where my classmates held that kind of hate in their hearts. None of those things were ever addressed by the coaches at UGA. There was literally nobody to speak to about these types of things without having fear of losing your position on the team.”

Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer said in a statement that he hoped Thursday's findings "will bring some closure and reassurance to the family and veterans involved in this process".
 He added: "Nobody wants to see service personnel or veterans facing extensive reinvestigations into the same incident, and our Overseas Operations Bill will help provide greater certainty and protections in the future."
 The government says the new law will protect the armed forces from "vexatious prosecutions" but critics argue it could decriminalise torture.
 The Iraq Fatality Investigations (IFI) team was set up after the High Court ruled that investigations conducted by the Iraq Historical Allegations Team (IHAT) should be followed up in the form of an inquest.
 IHAT had been looking into allegations made against Iraq war veterans but was shut down after the human rights lawyer Phil Shiner, involved in many of the abuse allegation cases, was struck off for misconduct.
 The £34m IHAT probe did not lead to any prosecutions and was branded as an "unmitigated failure" by MPs on the House of Commons Defence Committee.

Our skies are hazy with the cross-continental drift of smoke blowing from the West Coast wildfires, but that’s not why some people are holding their breath. A persistent drought — still somewhere between “moderate” and “severe” throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire — and a hot summer have set fire- watchers on edge about the potential for wildfires here.
 “It really preps the fuels, under the conditions that we’ve seen this summer, to make the conditions more conducive for a small fire turning into a much larger fire,” ranger Douglas Miner told N.H. Public Radio earlier this week.
 No one is predicting anything on the order of fires that have swept across 5 million acres of California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho, swallowing thousands of structures and killing at least three dozen people. Disaster on that scale is unthinkable.
