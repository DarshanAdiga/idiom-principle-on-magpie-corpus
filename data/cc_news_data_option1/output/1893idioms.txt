“We still have a few bugs to work out,” Watzke dead-panned in the middle of the swarm. The next day, he got a fogger to keep the mosquitoes and termites to a minimum.
 “We still have a problem with bad weather — I can’t operate the projector in the rain,” he said Tuesday. “We sort of lost last Friday night because of the weather and there are a few bad nights In a row coming up next week (in the forecast), but I’m looking at getting a shed I can put the projector in to keep it safe from the water.”
 For now, Watzke said, there’s no indication from the governor’s office when indoor cinemas can resume, but he’s planning to keep the temporary drive-in going as long as possible.
 “I’d consider keeping it going even after we get going again inside the theater, maybe have a double feature out in the parking lot,” he said. “I’m getting the asphalt fixed. I’d also consider working with an investor on building a full-time drive-in theater somewhere else in the county. I think drive-ins are going to be the big thing again.”
 The cost is $5 per person. The concession stand inside the theater is open.
 “I keep asking people to not bring their own food,” Watzke said. “We need people to buy the concessions so we can afford to pay the bills and keep this going.”
 On Thursday, May 14, he’s scheduled “Jaws” and “Ghost Rider.” On Friday, the line-up is “Cars” and “Kong:Skull Island.” Saturday’s showing will be “Terminator” and “Aliens.” On Sunday, the Beacon will show “The Indian in the Cupboard” and “Jurassic Park 3.”
 The Beacon has an FM transmitter that makes the movies’ sound available on your car radio at 107.3.
 Beacon Theatre is located behind McDonald’s in Waveland. For more, call 228-342-1346 or check out Beacon Theatres on Facebook.

This is a first for AAA.
 Memorial Day usually kicks off the summer travel season, but this year's holiday weekend many people are expected to just stay home.
 As for that summer vacation and whether to book that beach house - as we find out - that's a tricky question.
 "This is the first time in 20 years when we don't have a forecast to share," said AAA's Pioneer Valley's Sandra Marsian.
 Marsian also said there simply isn't data during this pandemic to predict memorial day travel.
 "In 2009 we had 31 million people traveling for the Memorial Day holiday. That period was considered the great recession. Last year we saw 43 million which was the highest we'd seen for Memorial Day travel. This year we can't even give you a prediction of what we're going to see," Marsian explained.
 Most of us won't hit the road or at least, stay pretty close to home Memorial Day weekend per pandemic guidelines, but what about booking that summer vacation?

Toward the end of the meeting, all council members agreed unanimously to meet in person for the next meeting on May 27.
 At Thursday morning's Mineral County commission meeting, county Administrator Drew Brubaker said he'd met with local and state court officials about what's next for the courthouse. The state Supreme Court, Brubaker said, will reopen on Monday and their conversation focused largely on security practices ahead of Mineral's courthouse resuming more normal operations May 21.
 Commissioner Richard "Doc" Lechliter said that county employees who had been teleworking previously returned to the courthouse this week on Monday. The courthouse has been open by appointment only to the public all along, he said, but will fully reopen May 26, operating with social distancing in mind.
 Court security will keep track of how many people are in the building at once, Lechliter said. Dividers have been put up between employees' desks, he said, as a means of trying to accommodate those who are physically unable to remain 6 feet apart from one another.
 The last few commission meetings have been held in the courtroom, rather than in the commission's usual smaller meeting quarters on the first floor of the building. Their next two meetings will be held in the courtroom as well, although that's because their meeting room will be occupied.
 "I think it's been going alright. We just have to watch and see," Lechliter said when asked how he felt the reopening process had fared thus far. "The main important thing seems to be, one, maintaining social distancing, and then keeping track of how many people are here."

 Oxford, a city of about 150,000 people an hour northwest of London, is home to legendary Oxford University, a 10-minute walk from the station. Some evidence suggests that teaching took place there as early as the 11th century, and by the end of the 12th century learning was in full swing, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world. Alumni include saints, prime ministers, and Hugh Grant, and the setting has inspired some of literature’s most beloved stories. (Lewis Carroll wrote _Alice in Wonderland_ here—check out the family-friendly festivities on Alice’s Day in July—and Lyra Belacqua, the heroine of alum Philip Pullman’s _His Dark Materials_ book series, grows up in a fictional version of Oxford.)

Salina Unified School District 305 gave parents and guardians information about the end of the school year and plans for the summer on Thursday.
   
 Thursday was the final day for seniors in the district, with the rest of the students ending the year on May 21.
   
 In a letter, USD 305 reminded families about the previously announced radio graduation ceremony, taking place Sunday at 2 p.m. for Central High School and 5 p.m. for South High School on KSKG 99.9 FM. The district also reminded families that a time for seniors to walk the stage in cap and gowns will be arranged once large group gatherings are permitted. According to the letter, details of this will be announced at a later date.
   
 The district also said K-11 students should return Chromebooks on Tuesday, May 26, and that all district-owned hotspots should be returned that day, as well. The letter said principals will be sending information on the building schedule for the returns and the process.
   
 Additionally, principals will communicate with families the process to return textbooks, calculators and other school-owned materials.
   
 On the subject of summer school, the district said it will look different this summer, with the district's Board of Education discussing changes to summer school at its June 9 meeting. The district did say it does not expect summer school to begin before July, but details will be shared with families through the district's messaging system, social media and local media outlets.
   
 As for summer athletics, the district said USD 305 coaches are still preparing for summer programming. USD 305 said once Gov. Laura Kelly announces a move into Phase 3 of the reopening plan, which will be no earlier than June 1, the district will set dates for practices to begin.
   
 The district said Kindergarten Round-up will be done virtually this year, with school and kindergarten readiness information provided on individual building websites and on the district's website, www.usd305.com.
   
 Finally, the letter ended with a message from Superintendent Linn Exline.
   
 "This school year was full of unexpected challenges," Exline said. "We will be prepared to sustain learning regardless of conditions in the fall. I will communicate plans for next year as more information becomes available. Thank you for trusting USD 305 with your student's education."

When Vermont officials announced that schools would need to close by March 18, Donna Reed and her fellow coaches at Kingdom Gymnastics decided it would be best to shut down their operation.
 So they voluntarily shuttered the gymnastics studio on March 17 for the health of their students and families that frequent their location at Green Mountain Mall.
 “We just thought it was going to be three weeks,” said Reed, who both owns the business but also works as an employee of the corporation. “I had no intention of going on unemployment and was just going to forego my salary.”
 But she soon learned that a couple weeks was likely going to become something much, much longer as Gov. Phil Scott announced the state’s cascade of social and business restrictions and for only the second time in her life, she applied for unemployment insurance.
 Reed was just one of tens of thousands of Vermonters whose jobs were upended by the pandemic and sought state assistance, that would be augmented by extra federal stimulus dollars.
 Unemployment Claims Skyrocket
 The last 2 months have seen historic levels of unemployment in Vermont as large swaths of the economy were shut down and people ordered to stay home. The Northeast Kingdom was not immune to the fallout.
 According to weekly reports released by the Vermont Department of Labor there was a nearly tenfold increase in claims for unemployment in the St. Johnsbury area between mid-March and the end of April. The increase in the Newport/Derby area was nearly that high.
 While official unemployment calculations for the month of April won’t be issued until next week, state officials have been saying for weeks that the unemployment rate will be historically high as they have grappled with the massive influx of claims and ramped up capacity within the Department of Labor to handle the work.
 The Northeast Kingdom has historically had some of the highest levels of unemployment in the state. In the March unemployment report issued on April 17, the Derby labor market had the state’s highest unemployment rate at 7.2%. St. Johnsbury’s was at 4.7% while the statewide total was 3.4%. The majority of the data that went into those calculations came from just before Vermont shut down.
 “The March data captures the early effects on unemployment with both the number of unemployed and the unemployment rate rising sharply,” said Department of Labor Acting Commissioner Michael Harrington at the time of the monthly unemployment announcement. “These increases are dwarfed by the elevated levels of unemployment insurance claims we have seen since mid-March. It is anticipated the monthly press release for April will look much different and should be more consistent with the significant economic disruption we are all experiencing.”
 In that interim, the number of unemployment claims filed from the St. Johnsbury area has risen from 304 in the March 14 weekly report of claims to a peak of 2,938 in the April 25 report. The number of claims filed in the Newport area has jumped from 535 in the March 14 report to 4,205 in the April 25 report.
 During that same time frame, statewide total claims increased even more dramatically, from 5,545 in the March 14 report to 81,574 in the April 25 report.
 Clearing All The Claims
 Reed now considers herself one of the lucky ones, but her attempt to receive unemployment wasn’t the smoothest and in some ways was typical of many Vermonters. The first week her unemployment claim went through but she didn’t receive her money when it was expected. The second week, when she tried to renew her claim, the online system wouldn’t accept her pin number and she was instructed to call the assistance line. What followed was days of frustration and hundreds if not thousands of unanswered calls, first on the day of the week designated for people whose last name began with R, then on a Saturday, which was open to everyone.
 Eventually she started calling her local legislators for help like Sen. Jane Kitchell and Rep. Scott Beck, who tried to help and offered assurance that the issues would be resolved eventually.
 In the end, a Department of Labor staffer reached Reed and helped resolve the technical issue that had tripped her up.
 Reed was part of that unprecedented increase in first time and continuing claims that the Department of Labor was working through.
 Updates on how the Department of Labor has progressed in clearing out the backlog of claims has become a regular aspect of Gov. Scott’s press conferences as DOL added staff, contracted with an outside firm to help field calls and updated its computer systems and procedures. What’s more, DOL had the added complication of getting the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program off the ground, an entirely new category of unemployment assistance for people previously ineligible that was created in the CARES Act stimulus bill.
 As it turns out, Reed wasn’t alone in turning to her legislators for help with resolving issues with unemployment. House and Senate members were inundated with calls and some members asked DOL if there was any way they could help. What came of that was the Legislative Action Team. Rep. Beck, of St. Johnsbury, is helping lead the effort of 25 legislators who are volunteering with DOL to act as a customer service liaison between constituents and DOL on lingering PUA claims. Reps. Sam Young and Chip Conquest are also part of the effort.
 The PUA program “was kind of like trying to build an airplane and fly it at the same time,” said Beck. There are countless reasons why someone’s claim could be hung up, said Beck, from unique employment scenarios, lack of internet access, a mistaken keystroke in the initial application, and on and on. In their efforts the legislators try to share basic information with the claimants and gather the necessary details that will help speed the claim through the process.
 Beck noted they are only a small part of the huge effort that has unfolded at DOL to handle nearly 90,000 unemployment insurance and pandemic assistance claims that have come in since early March. “I think we are making a difference,” he said. “We certainly didn’t solve the problem but we are trying to help out.” He also said anyone who is stuck and doesn’t feel like they are making progress through the normal channels is free to contact their legislator for assistance.
 Economic Fallout
 A more complete understanding of the pandemic’s economic toll won’t be understood for months and likely longer, but another marker will be revealed next week when DOL releases the April unemployment figures on May 22.
 While claims peaked in late April, the last two week’s reports showed decrease in the number of claims both statewide and from the Northeast Kingdom as state officials have begun to allow some businesses to resume operations.
 For Reed that loosening of restrictions can’t come soon enough. Despite acknowledging that she is actually making more money receiving unemployment because of the temporary boost in benefits from the federal stimulus bill, as are many others, Reed worries that if the shutdown lasts too much longer Kingdom Gymnastics may never be able to reopen.
 “I feel an obligation to the families whose kids cherish gymnastics,” said Reed. They closed their doors six days before her competition team was headed to the state meet. Reed says the studio will either need to offer free classes or refunds to the participants who didn’t get to finish their last sessions, and rent, utilities, insurance and other business expenses are still climbing. She now fears the repercussions of a prolonged shutdown.
 Reed, and her daughter Amy Bedor, who helps coach and manage the gymnastics studio besides having a full-time job, have already begun discussing strategies they can implement to keep their students and families safe if and when they are given the OK to reopen, provided it comes in time.
 “I don’t want to criticize Gov. Scott, he’s between a rock and a hard place and I do honor and recognize the need for the shutdown,” Reed said, while adding she hopes the reopening of the state accelerates. “That’s my personal belief … maybe I’m more of a risk taker and because I do own a business.”

 Health care workers and supermarket employees are risking their health to perform essential services. Many businesses will be forced to operate at reduced capacity. CEOs have voluntarily taken cuts in compensation. Special interest groups in Portsmouth must likewise do their part. There can be no sacred cows, not even the police, firefighters, or the schools.
   
 Our City Council was elected in part to get control of the budget. They must have the courage to stand up to career bureaucrats and popular local groups pressuring them to approve unnecessary positions, projects, or increases. The city manager's proposed increased budget offered little in the way of cuts and relied too much on deferring spending until future years when it will be more expensive to do the same things.
   
 Portsmouth taxpayers are counting on our new City Council with a new way of thinking to do the right thing even if it means some short term pain so that our City will experience much long term gain.

The short version of the disquisition was this: Investors should never bet against America. In the long run, things will work out. True, the long run may be very long. As Buffett pointed out, the Dow Jones Industrial Average did not exceed its 1929 peak until 1954. For an entire generation, investors in the Dow had to make do with whatever dividends they received.

A legitimate monetary rival of the NBA in my lifetime, at this point, hockey has less cultural relevance in the states than European soccer. It’s a regional sport in the U.S., so long as the team in that region is winning. And as of last season, half of the league’s teams brought in less than $15 million in operating income, with seven in the red. If those numbers held true this season, it means that most teams didn’t have a built-in financial cushion for an event like this. As such, every day the NHL lies dormant, the more likely it becomes that a team — or teams — goes bust.

CLAY COUNTY — The last day to request an absentee ballot for the June 2 election by mail is Wednesday, May 20.
 “Anyone can come to vote at the office up through June 1, the day before the general election,” Republican Director Patty Lamb of the Clay County Election Board said. The election board office is located at 100 W. Mississippi St. in Liberty. “Anyone can request an absentee ballot, but they have to choose why they are voting absentee. By law, they have to pick a reason.”
 As the stay-at-home orders statewide changed the April 7 election date to June 2, there are still safety concerns being ironed out before voting at the polls can take place. Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft’s office personnel is delivering face masks, distancing strips, hand sanitizer, face shields and posters to local election authorities for polling places. Clay County Election Board should receive their stock Thursday, May 14.
 “We believe we are going to have the necessary face masks and shields to cover our poll workers,” Lamb said. “We are going to ask that people adhere to the 6 feet physical distancing (requirement). We are also going to limit how voters touch voting implements.”
 Rather than have poll workers put voter ID cards or a driver’s license in a tablet to verify a voter, the voter will be asked to place necessary identification in the digital device, Lamb said.
 “When the voter needs to sign the tablet, that person will be handed his or her own pen, which will have the soft tip to sign and then the pen part to fill in the voting ballot,” she said. “It has been a challenge to set up for this election, but we are hopeful we have all the equipment and rules in place.”
 Lamb said used pens can be handed back to poll workers and the pens will be disinfected and reused in a future election. Should people still not feel comfortable voting inside their current polling place, Lamb said people can take advantage of curbside voting.
 “We are trying to give them as many outlets to safely vote,” she said.
 Lamb predicts around a 15% voter turnout.
 Clay County Democratic Director Tiffany Francis said the election board is also looking for poll workers who are younger as many poll workers tend to be 60 and older and part of the high risk group for getting COVID-19.
 “We often have retired poll workers, but they are also the age group that is most vulnerable to the coronavirus,” she said. “We are looking for some younger people to get involved. It might be a great job for a teacher.”Francis said poll workers have to be 18 or older to handle ballots, but if older high schoolers want to help open doors or be on hand, the help would be appreciated.

The 3D Sonic Max was expected to launch in the Galaxy S20 lineup but didn’t make the cut, with Samsung instead sticking with Qualcomm’s heavily criticised gen-one ultrasonic reader used in the Galaxy S10. Unsurprisingly, reviews pinpointed the unlocking experience of the S20 phones as one of their worst attributes. Considering how often you unlock a phone every day, this is a fundamental flaw which the Note 20 range will fix.

This is not an evil, of course, that concerns only the textile sector, although this, recently undergoing an intense process of outsourcing and relocation, is perhaps one of the most worrisome for consumers. The deplorable conditions of workers who extract the minerals from which the big electronic brands source are also well-known. Apple, Google, Dell, Tesla and Microsoft face a lawsuit in the US after the collapse of a cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that killed 14 minors. Or those of those in the first links of our food supply chains. Ferrero, for example, has recently come under fire for the alleged presence of child labor in the supply chain of his famous chocolates, particularly in Turkey. Or the environmental disasters with which the large oil companies are related: France's Total is currently facing a pioneering judicial process for its activities in a protected natural park in Uganda. Or the abuses against the most vulnerable populations in which large homebuilders have been implicated. ACS has been singled out for its connection to a hydroelectric project in Guatemala that threatens the environment and the way of life of the local indigenous community; and Ferrovial, accused of profiting from the management of controversial refugee centers in Australia, the scene of serious human rights abuses.

NORTHUMBERLAND, N.H. — A local community servant is an award-winning “Older Adult Volunteer.”
 Harold E. Marshall Jr. was so designated by state agencies in New Hampshire. The news was shared on Wednesday.
 Marshall, 81, said he got a call three or four weeks ago about the honor. He said he wasn’t expecting the recognition.
 “Well I was totally surprised,” he said. “I do all this for the fun of it and I didn’t expect to get an award from any of it.”
 Each year the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the New Hampshire State Commission on Aging, and EngAGING NH select people from each county for the Older Adult Volunteer Award.
 “During Older Americans Month (May), the Commission on Aging recognizes individuals or couples age 60 or older from each of New Hampshire’s ten counties for their outstanding volunteer efforts on behalf of older adults and others in their communities,” notes information from the award-giving agencies.
 The Grafton County honor went to Robert and Effie Bachand, a couple from Enfield, N.H., this year.
 The awardees are celebrated each May with a formal gathering with the governor, but not this year. Social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19 forced a postponement of the award event.
 Melinda Marshall Kennett, Northumberland Town Clerk and Marshall’s daughter, said she has not been told when the awards celebration will occur.
 “I’m sure as things start opening back up we will hear something, but to know he is being recognized is making my heart happy and proud!” she stated in an email.
 Kennett is the person who nominated Marshall for the recognition. Understanding the qualifying criteria for the award and watching her father in action her whole life made Marshall the obvious person for her to nominate.
 “He is a Veteran Marine and is involved with the American Legion,” she wrote. “He volunteers for so many things to be a helping hand. He is a mentor and teacher at Riverside Speedway for the young adults beginning and also for the kart program.”
 And that’s not all.
 “He is a tractor trailer instructor for WMMC and has a true passion for helping students outside at any time, day or night. He was a member of the Groveton Fire Dept., he helped form the Conn. Valley Snow Riders snowmobile club. He is a fire warden,” she noted.
 In her nomination letter, Kennett wrote, “My Dad is almost 81 years old and he has set such a great example demonstrating his leadership and skills to all that need it and then some.”
 She noted his work history that began on the family farm before he became a truck driver.
 “He has never retired to this day. He still volunteers and works, plus takes care of my disabled mother,” she wrote. “He can run circles around most men 50 years younger than he is!”
 Kennett credits her father for helping her become the person she is. “He has paved the way for me to also demonstrate leadership skills within my community. It is through his contributions and coaching that I am the person that I am today!”
 Marshall is currently far less active these days due to restrictions related to COVID-19. His daughters get the groceries for he and his wife of 58 years, Nancy. His one masked daily outing is across the river to Guildhall to get his mail. He said he’s glad the North Country region has very few known virus cases and he’s doing OK with laying low for now.
 He said he does hope things can start to open up this summer. He said he’s eager to get back to the racetrack and help out with the Kart racing. He also said he’s got a coupe he intends to race. Marshall is the first inductee of the Riverside Hall Of Fame. He also was a frequent racer at the Waterford Speedway in the 1960s.
 “I have always been into racing and I’ve always been willing to try to help anybody out,” he said.

He’s severely speech delayed and avoids eye contact most of the time, so I’ve often compared myself to wildlife photographer. But sometimes, I suppose that is just children in general. Sometimes shooting him just as he interacts in that time and place- and other times laying low, out of sight, waiting for the moment he looks at the camera for even the splittest of seconds. I am a portrait photographer at heart.and my brave little boy is my muse.”

The panel was made up of Chief Justice Robert Brutinel, Vice Chief Justice Ann Scott Timmer, Justice John Lopez and Justice James Beene. Justice Clint Bolick recused himself from the decision. The justice also earlier recused himself from the election challenge against Rep. Shawnna Bolick, his wife. The court allowed Rep. Bolick to remain on the ballot. His recusal was based on a conflict of interest that he extended to any other case involving his wife’s legal counsel, who represented the plaintiff in Dunn’s challenge.
