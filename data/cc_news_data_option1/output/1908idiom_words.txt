Research shows that kids, especially those who are in minority groups or already overweight, gain weight at a faster rate during summer vacations compared to the school year, said Angela Luciani, a registered dietitian in Philadelphia. Researchers believe this is largely because the food that kids eat at home may be less nutritious than the food offered at school.
 Plus, kids don’t have regimented physical activities anymore, Luciani said. “They’re stuck inside and not going out to the park with their friends, so there’s definitely less opportunity for them to be active.”
 How much time kids are spending in front of screens is also concerning, said Peter Bidey, director of family medicine at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. Because quarantine can be such a stressful time, he said families may be eating more “comfort foods,” which tend to be high in calories and have less nutritional value than fresh foods.
