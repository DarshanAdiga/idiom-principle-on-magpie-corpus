Jose Mourinho has insisted Tottenham were never in the running to sign Willian after he left Chelsea because they could not rival the wages Arsenal were offering to the Brazilian. The pair worked together at Stamford Bridge and the Blues notably beat Spurs to the signing of the winger from Anzhi Makhachkala back in 2013.Willian, 32, has endured a slow start to life at the Emirates since he agreed a three-year deal in August, but is still expected to feature in Sunday&rsquo;s north London derby at Tottenham.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have money for Willian,&rdquo; Mourinho said. &ldquo;We cannot pay the wages that he gets at Arsenal so I didn&rsquo;t want to waste our time because we cannot pay these wages.&ldquo;He is still dangerous, he is still one of the best players in the Premier League.&ldquo;Apart from that, he is a good friend. I have nothing to hide in relation to that. We keep in touch, we keep in contact, we call each other.&ldquo;We wish good things to each other. He is my friend and of course he is a very good player.&rdquo;Mourinho says the feeling at Tottenham ahead of this derby compared to the meeting in July is very different.When Toby Alderweireld&rsquo;s 81st-minute header sealed a 2-1 victory over Arsenal during the summer, both clubs were languishing in mid-table. This time around Spurs are top of the Premier League and unbeaten in the division since the opening day.&ldquo;It is a little bit different because we want the points and we are not just like, we want to beat Arsenal because to beat Arsenal is the only good thing we can give to our fans,&rdquo; Mourinho added.&ldquo;It happened last season when we played Arsenal in the last part of the season. It was about winning against Arsenal to give something good, to have a good feeling.&ldquo;In this moment, we also look to the table and we are in a good position, fighting for positions in the top part of the table.&ldquo;But we never forget the fact that there are historical rivalries and what it means for the fans.&ldquo;Even for people that were not born at Tottenham, and many of us are in this situation, when you arrive at the club you understand the culture, you learn the culture and you share the values with the fans.&rdquo;Harry Kane knows what this fixture means more than most having progressed from Spurs&rsquo; academy – after a brief stint with Arsenal originally – to score 10 times against the Gunners.An unspecified injury saw the striker ruled out of Thursday&rsquo;s 3-3 draw with LASK, but he is set to return on Sunday.&ldquo;He had a little problem,&rdquo; Mourinho said. &ldquo;He was not available. It was not like I wanted to protect him. He had a problem but it&rsquo;s the kind of problem that I can say I expect him to play.&rdquo;

Sidney W. Jackson Jr.   Luverne - Mr. Sidney W. Jackson "Jack" Jr., 95, a resident of Luverne, Alabama, passed away peacefully in his home, surrounded by his family, on Wednesday, December 2, 2020. The family held a private graveside service for Mr. Jackson on Saturday, December 5th, in Luverne Emmaus Cemetery with Rev. Darren Easter officiating and Turners Funeral Home of Luverne directing.   Jack grew up in Petrey, Alabama, graduated from Luverne High School, and went on to attend the University of Alabama where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Business. While at Alabama, he was the president of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, and met the love of his life Bobbie. He also joined the ROTC, and later served in Germany following WWII. After his service, he became a successful and respected businessman in his community. He was an officer and owner of W.L. Petrey Wholesale Company, was a founder & board member of First Citizens Bank of Luverne, and a real estate developer. He was also honored to become a deacon of the Luverne First United Methodist Church. Jack continued to work at Petrey for over 60 years, making the round trip from Luverne to Petrey over 15,000 times.   Jack was devoted to his wife, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, extended family and friends. He was a founder of Crenshaw Christian Academy in 1968, and strongly believed in a good education for his children. He also loved to have a good time. Jack was an avid golfer, world traveler, and loved all types of sporting events that involved football, basketball, or baseball.   Jack had a low key, but dynamic personality. He could light up a room without being flashy, and had a gift to make you feel welcome and wanted without being overbearing. The standard takeaways from those who met him was "the nicest man ever," "they don't make them like that anymore," "what a fine man," and "just a great guy." In his later years, he and his special friend, Mary West, loved to cook, go out, and spend time together, including Troy football games. He was close to his brother Jim, who was his across the street neighbor for over 50 years. They were known as the "best brothers ever," and every day they would work crossword puzzles, and Jim would exercise Jack, a great recipe for staying active 95 years.   People sought Jack's advice, which he would subtly parse out when least expected, the type of advice that would stick. He set the example for his family and friends by doing and giving, especially of his time, and by being the type of leader everyone should be. He was not a hurried or temperamental man. He was there for them, always, and he is still here and will be missed. He was, as they say, one of a kind.   Mr. Jackson was preceded in death by his wife, Bobbie H. Jackson; parents, Sidney "Sid" Sr & Myra Petrey Jackson; and sister, Betty Gibson. He is survived by his four children, Lee Jackson Moncus, Celia Jackson (David) Partlow, Sidney W. (Alyson) Jackson III, and Leslie Jackson (Frank) Moody; twelve grandchildren, Sidney Petrey Bagwell, Leslie Moncus (Bowen) Chapman, Janie Lee Moody Moncus, Mary Jane Partlow (Branham) Moore, Beeson (Stephanie) Partlow, Jack (Sarah) Partlow, Cece Partlow, Maggie Partlow, Sidney W. (Lysa) Jackson IV, Sarah Haden Vance, Diana Katherine (Adam) Meter, Townsend Vance, and Susannah Jackson; six great-grandchildren; beloved brother, James "Jim" William Jackson; and many nieces, nephews, cousins, & friends.   Active pallbearers were Sidney Jackson IV, Adam Meter, Beeson Partlow, Jack Partlow, Branham Moore, and Bowen Chapman.   The family would like to express their profound & deep gratitude to Mr. Jackson's caregivers, Angela Cowart, Martha Shepherd, Renetta Blair, and Mable Levens.   Any memorial donations may be made to the Luverne Public Library, 148 East Third Street, Luverne, Alabama 36049.

However, voting to deny the application was not the original recommendation brought to the Preston board.
 Superintendent Steve Wotring had recommended at previous meetings — and into Monday’s session — that the board defer to the Mon County board in rendering a decision on the application. State law now prohibits county school systems from impeding students who want to go to school in other counties and take their state funding with them. No matter whether the board were to approve or deny the charter school application, Preston students would still be free to attend the school, if it opens.
 “If we as Preston County defer to the Mon County Board of Education and what they say their approval status is, because of the fact that the school is going to be located in Mon County, it makes no difference,” board President Jack Keim said. “We could vote no, we could vote yes — and still makes no difference because if it’s approved in Mon County, Mon County is still able to take students from Preston County.”
 As Wotring’s recommendation to defer the application decision was on the meeting agenda, the board put it up for a vote.
 “I think that we could save a lot of complaints and problems and everything in the future if we just vote to go along with Mon County because they’re going to control it anyhow, and it makes no difference what we do,” Keim said.
 Board member Pam Feathers called for an outright rejection of the application instead.
 “It needs to matter to our Preston County residents and students that we care about them. We want to fight for them, and we want to keep them here,” Feathers said. “Whether they go or not, I say we stand strong and fight for our kids in Preston County to keep them here. They’re worth it.”
 Keim told Feathers that if she felt that way, Wotring’s recommendation should be voted down and another motion made.
 That recommendation fell on a 2-3 vote, with Keim and Jeanne Dreisbach voting in favor, and Feathers, Jeff Zigray and Bruce Huggins opposing it.

NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - One of Louisiana’s largest health systems expresses hope first responders could begin getting vaccines well before Christmas. They laid out a possible timetable for two vaccines, with a possible third vaccine waiting in the wings. With Louisiana’s COVID-19 death rate now at over 6,500 people the wait for a vaccine grows more intense. “Pfizer is going up for FDA approval December 10 and we think it will be distributed by mid December,” said Katherine Baumgarten, MD, Ochsner Medical Director over infectious diseases. During a Friday Facebook live event, Ochsner doctors discussed the vaccine timetable as well as first recipients. “Healthcare workers will be prioritized at first we may not have enough I will have to prioritize those with higher risks,” said Baumgarten. The state health department expects Louisiana will get 80-thousand doses before the end of the year Probably from Pfizer or Moderna. SEE THE LATEST CORONAVIRUS INFORMATION ON HELP AND RECOVERY HERE.And Ochsner says they are preparing now. University medical center is making preparation as well but they worry about covering enough people. “Even if we get some of the first doses available if there is only a handful of those available that is still obviously not enough for the number of people that are at risk,” said UMC Chief Medical Officer Nirav Patel, MD. Ochsner says both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require a second dose to be administered up to 28 days after the first, but there is another possible vaccine being looked at they would only require a single dose. “The dose we are studying at Ochsner by Jansen is a single dose and we’re waiting on data,” said Baumgarten. Which ever vaccine is given, Ochsner says side effects will depend on the patient. It is a risk many say they are willing to take, some before the holidays. “It would be a great Christmas present, maybe we can get a little bit just before Christmas,” said Ochsner Chief Medical Officer Robert Hart, MD. Ochsner says for those who get either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, they can expect the vaccine to be 95% effective against coronavirus. Without the second dose, they say all bets are off.Copyright 2020 WVUE. All rights reserved.See a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it. Please include title of story.

Season 1 is messy, tossing us into the grinder of a brutal Federation/Klingon war and spinning its wheels a bit too often (there are about 12 episodes of story in 15 episodes). But the show clicks in season 2, with the arrival of season-long guest star Anson Mount as Captain Christopher Pike, a character from the original series (and the Abrams reboot films) who immediately ranks as among the best captains in all of _Trek_ , which is no small feat. Mount's commanding, hopeful energy refocuses the entire series, making the entire regular cast around him better. Thankfully, that positive energy carries forward into the ongoing season 3, which sees the series continue to take one major swing after another. Sometimes successfully. Sometimes not. But at least _Trek_ is alive and kicking and trying to be something new. Franchises this old should fall into formulaic ruts and _Discovery_ is shaking off any easy classification.

SOUTH BEND — For the first time since 2001, a Notre Dame football team will be playing a regular season game in the month of December.
 The No. 2 Fighting Irish (9-0, 8-0 ACC) have one last regular season contest Saturday when they host Syracuse (1-9, 1-8 ACC) inside Notre Dame Stadium (2:30 p.m., NBC).
 Back in 2001, Notre Dame visited Purdue on Dec. 1 in West Lafayette. The game was originally scheduled to take place Sept. 15 that season, but was postponed to December in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. The Irish won, 24-18, to finish the season at 5-6.

Hendersonville City Council heard a detailed breakdown of demographics among city staff, trends in the community, survey results and more Thursday as members fine tune a proposed diversity and inclusion position in the city's Human Resources department.
   
 The council voted to move forward with the position in September, with plans for the job to focus on helping Hendersonville staff be more diverse by recruiting and retaining diverse candidates and providing employees with resources.
   
 Council members have weighed several actions following community conversations about how to celebrate and understand diversity in the community, but residents had mixed reactions.
   
 Speaking during the meeting's public comment portion, Indian Jackson said "creating that part-time position is not it. It's a start. We have to do more than that."
   
 Western Carolina University student Wendy Nevarez presented the findings of her research about such positions, after looking at similar posts at other organizations, and gave her recommendation that the city create a hybrid position instead of an employee solely dedicated to diversity and inclusion.
   
 Nevarez said the diversity advocate would address equity, diversion and inclusion both internally with city staff and externally in the community.
   
 The position "signals to the citizens that diversity, equity and inclusion are important," she said. "And this is a proactive approach versus a reactive approach."
   
 Digging into the city's demographics, she showed that the African American population in Hendersonville has dropped by 19.44% between 2000 and 2018, and the Hispanic and Latino population has risen across the board, representing about 8.3% of the city's total population.
   
 African Americans are continuing to move to the southeast of the city, her research showed, to the East Flat Rock and Upward Road areas.
   
 She also broke down city departments by race of employees, showing across the board that compared to the city's demographics, white residents are over- represented among staff.
   
 "The white race is overrepresented in every single department," Nevarez said, showing percentages of different ethnicities working in city departments.
   
 Six departments were 100% white, but the city's police department, with 13% Black members, is over-represented for the Black population in the city, she said, which is 8.9% citywide.
   
 Getting a representative bureaucracy is step one, with step two being diverse engagement with the community.
   
 After surveying staff, Nevarez found the desire for a diversity advocate ranked fifth among respondents, though she said a diversity advocate who would handle other goals as well would keep those issues from getting passed on as just another "hat" for other employees.
   
 Among the top-ranked wishes were diversity in hiring and a diversity mission.
   
 Of the 109 employees who responded to her survey, 74.49% said that social equity "should be a core value for the city of Hendersonville."
   
 On whether to hire an employee to focus only on diversity and inclusion, Nevarez said, "I will say no, simply because there should not be, due to the size and resources; it doesn't make sense for one person to focus solely on that and not do other job functions."
   
 But, it's important that management and the council take on the role of shaping a positive culture and keeping energy and support up for the hybrid position to do diversity advocate job functions, she said.
   
 The broad goal and initiative for the position, she said, would be to create a more diverse and inclusive city government, create equitable policies and practices, and focus on building and fostering community relationships.
   
 City Manager John Connet said they will take the job description put together by Nevarez, tweak it to fit the city's pay structure and other details, and bring it back to council in January for final approval.
   
 Councilman Jeff Miller said the issue should go before the diversity committee as well.
   
 Raises for city staff
   
 With sales tax revenues outpacing bleak forecasts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hendersonville is taking the opportunity to reward its employees with a $1,000 bonus and by unfreezing its scheduled pay raises.
   
 City Manager John Connet told council that although sales tax revenues were expected to decrease, they have actually been up this year. Forecasts show fiscal year 2021 outpacing budgeted totals by nearly $400,000.
   
 The total impact to the budget for the bonuses and raises should be between $325,000 and $350,000, according to the agenda.
   
 "I'm happy to say that our revenue is coming in very well," Connet said. "We expect to continue to do well moving forward."
   
 Given that strong financial position and hard work from city employees under stressful conditions over the past year, he said, staff recommended reinstating the raises and issuing the one-time bonuses.
   
 The council voted unanimously to approve the measure.
   
 Infrared sewer survey
   
 The city also approved $33,875 to cover half the cost of an aerial infrared imaging survey of its sanitary sewer system, which will show potential leaks in the city's water and sanitary sewer collection system as well as any leaks from privately-owned septic systems in the city.
   
 The move was proposed by nonprofit MountainTrue, which will cover the other half of the total $67,750 cost with funds appropriated in a state House bill.
   
 With equipment fitted into an airplane, the city will be photographed from above to create a thermal map of certain areas to show sources of pollution and waste, according to information provided with the agenda by Stockton Infrared Thermographic Services, which will carry out the work.
   
 The deal includes a report of the findings with each thermal anomaly marked individually, with their latitude and longitude listed.
   
 French Broad Riverkeeper Hartwell Carson said, "I wouldn't say it's a silver bullet tool, but it's the best that is out there to find sewer and water leaks."
   
 He added that Brevard has found the program to be very successful.
   
 Arts center gets COVID-19 financial assistance
   
 The council also decided in a 3-2 vote to provide financial assistance for the Center for Arts and Entertainment.
   
 The funds will help the center get up to COVID-19 safety standards. The $15,000 will cover a little less than half of the expense of getting the facility ready to seat nearly 130 people while observing safety precautions.
   
 According to information with Thursday's agenda, the money will help fund a new virus-killing air filter for the HVAC system; masks and gloves for staff; hand-sanitizing stations and gel; face shields; temperature scanners; cleaning equipment and more.
   
 In exchange, the Center will list the city as a Partnership Patron, giving a ticket discount to city employees, giving the city the opportunity to rent facilities for free and more.
   
 A $1 million request from Hands On! Children's Museum to help with the purchase of a portion of the former Rodson Mall was removed from the agenda at the start of the meeting.

WASHINGTON — After numerous fits and starts and months of inaction, optimism is finally building in Washington for a COVID-19 aid bill that would offer relief for businesses, the unemployed, schools, and health care providers, among others struggling as caseloads are spiking.
 Under pressure from moderates in both parties, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have initiated late-game negotiations in hopes of combining a relief package of, in all likelihood, less than $1 trillion with a separate $1.4 trillion governmentwide omnibus spending bill. The duo were the architects of the $1.8 trillion CARES Act, the landmark relief bill March.
 Success is not certain and considerable differences remain over items such as aid to states and local governments, liability protections for businesses and universities reopening during the pandemic, and whether to issue a second round of $1,200 direct payments to most Americans.
 But renewing soon-to-expire jobless benefits, providing a second round of “paycheck protection” subsidies, and funding to distribute vaccines are sure bets to be included in any deal.
 Here are the top issues for the end-stage COVID-19 relief talks.
 ___
 JOBLESS BENEFITS
 The CARES Act created a $600 per-week bonus COVID-19 unemployment benefit that sustained household incomes and consumer demand during the springtime shutdowns. It expired at the end of July and Republicans are against its renewal. The CARES Act also allowed for additional weeks of emergency pandemic unemployment payments at regular benefit levels — which are themselves about to expire, on Dec. 31. Any deal is sure to extend the emergency benefits, and a bipartisan compromise framework that’s helping guide the talks calls for restoring half of the bonus benefit, or $300 per week more.
 ___
 BUSINESS SUBSIDIES
 Another sure thing is a reauthorization of the Paycheck Protection Program, also established by the CARES Act, to give a second round of subsidies to businesses struggling through the pandemic and make other changes to the program, which enjoys bipartisan support but is particularly revered by Republicans. Leftover PPP funds from two springtime infusions into the program would cover almost half of the $300 billion or so cost.
 ___
 DIRECT PAYMENTS
 President Trump has long supported another $1,200 round of direct payments to most Americans, subject to income limits that make upper-bracket taxpayers ineligible. House Democrats support the idea, but it is unpopular with many Senate Republicans and was left out of a scaled-back Senate GOP plan. A bipartisan bill by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and others, leaves out the direct payments as well, and their up to $300 billion cost could render them too expensive for inclusion in the year-end package, though lawmakers ranging from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-Maine, to Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., are pushing to retain them.
 ___
 STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
 This is one of the trickiest issues in the talks — another round of aid to states and local governments to follow a $150 billion this spring. It’s a top priority of Pelosi and other Democrats but is opposed by many Republicans, who warn it would bail out states run by Democrats like California and New York. Trump doesn’t like the idea as well, but Pelosi’s demands for the money have been slashed from earlier amounts approaching $1 trillion. Revenue losses due to COVID-19 haven’t been as large as feared. But smaller localities left out of the first tranche of payments are eager for funding. A plan endorsed by moderates would provide $160 billion.
 ___
 LIABILITY SHIELD
 Businesses reopening during the pandemic have for months been seeking a shield against lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks. McConnell is the most potent backer of the idea and he’s drafted sweeping protections against lawsuits for businesses, universities, and other organizations. The powerful trial lawyers lobby — which still holds great influence with Democrats — is opposed, and McConnell’s fears of a wave of COVID-related lawsuits haven’t materialized. Veteran Senate Judiciary Committee members Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, have been deputized to negotiate the issue, a sign the talks are at a serious stage.
 ___
 ODDS AND ENDS
 Numerous smaller items are ripe for inclusion, including $10 billion for the Postal Service, a $20 billion-plus deal adding food aid sought by Democrats and farm subsidies favored by Republicans, more than $100 billion in funding for schools seeking to reopen, along with funding for child care, Amtrak, transit systems, and health care providers.

HILLSDALE -- The city of Hillsdale's work to completely reconstruct a section of Fayette Street between Carleton and West streets is nearly completed.
   
 Kristin Bauer, the city's engineer, said as of Tuesday all the concrete has been placed for the box culvert end sections and concrete headwalls.
   
 "As luck would have it the swelling of the river from recent rain and snow has caused a breach in the dams at the upstream and downstream ends of the culvert, as such overnight the river put itself into the culvert," Bauer said.
   
 The contractor for the project was on site Wednesday evaluating the situation and developed a solution as the city still needed to strip concrete forms and finish up the work on the river banks necessitating the continuance of the river by-pass.
   
 The plan for the upcoming weeks, Bauer said, is to strip the concrete forms and begin the work on the river banks work next week.
   
 "It is anticipated that our work for the season may be completed by mid- December," Bauer said. "This is, of course, weather dependent. Temporary asphalt has been placed so when we do open the road it will be on a paved surface."
   
 It should be noted that, due to some construction constraints at the culvert, the road is only 18 feet wide and has a mini-s curve, which the city hopes will slow traffic in the area.
   
 Concrete barriers will be placed for safety at the culvert but the road will be narrow.
   
 "We will be maintaining the barricades over the winter noting the construction zone as it will be considered an active construction site but car traffic will be allowed into the area when we finally open the site," Bauer said.
   
 Construction will resume in late April or May and the remaining work will be completed at that time. There is approximately 200 feet of road work left around the culvert area to be done.
   
 "All told the project has run very smoothly and things have gone well," Bauer added.
