KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) — A 17-year-old from Illinois accused of killing two men during an August protest in Wisconsin faces a preliminary hearing in the case. Hearings such as the one Thursday in Kenosha are generally used to determine whether enough evidence exists to proceed to a trial. Kyle Rittenhouse is charged with homicide and attempted homicide in the shootings. They came during a night of unrest in Kenosha following the police shooting two days earlier of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse is free on $2 million bond largely provided by supporters who see him as a patriot who was trying to protect other people's property. Others view him as a trigger-happy youth whose presence with a rifle incited protesters.

Am făcut Liceul de Construcții, pe partea de Arhitectură, iar în timpul liceului, sinceră să fiu, nu știam exact ce îmi doresc să fac în viitor. Nu aveam o viziune în fața mea, despre ce aș putea să fac eu. În momentul în care am făcut cursul de prim ajutor la SMURD, acolo mi-am dat seama că îmi place să ajut oamenii, îmi place să intervin în situații de urgență și practic cred că în momentul în care am făcut acest curs, cursul respectiv mi-a deschis ochii către drumul meu spre această meserie pe care o ador”, a rememorat Maria Elena Casoni momentul în care s-a îndrăgostit iremediabil de SMURD și de profesia de salvator de vieți.

Bengaluru FC will look for their first win of the season when they take on southern rivals Chennaiyin FC in an Indian Super League match at the GMC Athletic Stadium here on Friday. (More Football News)      Both the teams have played twice so far, with BFC winless following consecutive stalemates, while CFC registering a victory and draw.      Two-time champions Chennaiyin FC was dealt a blow when head coach Csaba Laszlo confirmed that left-back Jerry Lalrinzuala will start on Friday in place of Chhuantea Fanai, who was substituted in the previous game against Kerala Blasters due to injury.      The fixture between Chennaiyin and Bengaluru has become a huge rivalry since BFC entered the ISL fold in 2017. The final that season was a closely contested affair that CFC won 3-2 on Bengaluru's turf to lift a second ISL title.
