Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Thursday resigned from the Union Cabinet in protest against "anti-farmer ordinances and legislation".   The resignation came soon after Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Sukhbir Singh Badal opposed the farm sectors bills in Parliament.

Proud to stand with farmers as their daughter and sister," Harsimrat Kaur Badal said in a tweet. (ANI)
