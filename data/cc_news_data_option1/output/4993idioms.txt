We must do far more if we are to reach our goal of achieving universal health coverage by 2030. This means spending more on health. But it also means spending better, from protecting health workers and strengthening infrastructure to preventing diseases and providing health care close to home, in the community. Investments in health systems also improve countries’ preparedness and response to future health emergencies.

Oregon State’s offensive line doesn’t have a player as talented as Kayvon Thibodeaux. It doesn’t have one as physical as Noah Sewell.
 On paper, those two players and the rest of Oregon’s star-studded defense should have steamrolled the Beavers’ offensive front last Friday. And yet, Oregon State’s unheralded O-line did what it has done all year: executed the game plan and found a way to be better than it was the week before as it pushed Oregon State to a thrilling upset win.
 With the season now past the halfway point, the Beavers’ group of offensive lineman have been the unsung heroes for a team that is overachieving and turning heads in the Pac-12. A band of two- and three-star recruits has blossomed into one of the best run-blocking groups in the conference, seemingly overnight.

With a Democrat now in charge, fiscal conservatives will be hitting hard on the claim that it’s irresponsible to deepen the nation’s already-hefty debt. So it’s more important than ever for people to understand why some of the more emotionally appealing of those arguments are specious.
 Two common pro-austerity refrains, for instance, are that the government should stay out of debt like a prudent household, or be run efficiently and profitably like a business.
 But the federal government is a unique entity, with different objectives and more borrowing capacity than any private entity — or even state governments.
 Let’s debunk the business analogy first. Political candidates, especially conservative ones, sometimes vow to run government like they would run a company. And there are some ways in which experience from the latter sphere can absolutely be applied to the former, usually in the realm of operational efficiency. But there are more important ways that the government isn’t like a business.
 The biggest is that a business is beholden to shareholders, while government is beholden to the public good. If a company consistently fails to make operating profit, it’s a money-losing, value-destroying operation and needs to be shut down or reorganized.
 But government doesn’t exist to make a profit; when a government service loses money, it can still be worth it if it improves things for the public overall.
 For example, when government spends money on basic research, it typically doesn’t capture the monetary value that research creates. But the eventual economic benefits, which are reaped by companies downstream of government- funded research, tend to vastly outweigh the cost.
 The government doesn’t need to be the one that gets paid, as long as society gets paid. The same is often true of environmental cleanup, road networks and anything with a positive externality.
 It also applies to fiscal stimulus during recessions. Even if the government doesn’t recoup the full cost of emergency spending programs in terms of increased tax revenue, the economic activity generated by stimulus often outweighs the costs.
 In the long term, the government can run deficits forever, as long as the economy grows faster than the debt. In the short term, it can run up debt even faster than that and still be OK, as long as it’s a temporary thing — like covid relief, or the stimulus in the Great Recession. All of this is very different from how a business operates.

DETROIT (AP) — A week after being fined for delaying safety recalls, Hyundai says it will recall about 130,000 vehicles in the U.S. because the engines could fail.The recall covers certain 2012 Santa Fe SUVs, 2015 and 2016 Veloster cars, and Sonata Hybrid cars from 2011 through 2013, and 2016.Hyundai says the recall will address a manufacturing issue that could cause the connecting rod bearings to wear out and the engines to fail or catch fire.The recall stems from discussions in an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Owners will be notified in late January.Dealers will replace the engine if the bearings are damaged.All of the vehicles will get a knock sensor system to monitor symptoms that come before an engine fails.For more information on recalls, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s recall page.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Rovers are short on numbers in the second row but Smith has earmarked Sims for the engine room.
 “He sort of indicated he wants me to play in the middle,” said Sims.
 “I mentioned to him that lock is probably my preferred position and allows me to roam around. He likes that I’ve got a bit of versatility with a pass as well.
 “I don’t want to get over there and overplay my hand because I’ve never played in the league before.
 “It’s going to be a touch and feel sort of thing for the first couple of weeks.”
 By his own admission 2020 was a frustrating year as injuries restricted Sims to five appearances for an underperforming St George team that was subjected to strict biosecurity rules.
 Rovers endured similar frustrations but Sims is confident the club will turn the corner next season.
 “It’ll obviously be a challenge but the club itself and the coaching staff know themselves they had a tough year,” he said.
 “It’s not all going to be on my shoulders, it’s going to be distributed around the team.

 “I plan to get over there and really hang off their hip and learn about the club and the city and really immerse myself in the culture.”

LBMM is the story of a ‘know it all’ little girl who finds out she has probably bitten more than she can chew and learns a few not so pleasant lessons in the process. It began one beautiful evening when we all sat – my kids and I were in front of the television watching cartoons – and my twin boys wouldn’t just quit walking in and out of the room barefoot and in their underpants. They were acting like cartoon characters themselves. They were about five years old at the time and would often love to be chased around the house to go take a bath, brush their teeth, or even put some footwear on. And the first four characters were born that same day- Ladybuckit, Pantylegs, Slipperhead, and Cupsticks. The idea was originally to create something that would teach kids to commit to cleaning up themselves.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration must accept new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects some young immigrants from deportation, a federal judge ruled Friday, in vacating a memo from the acting Homeland Security secretary that had suspended it.U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said the government had to post a public notice within three days — including on its website and the websites of all other relevant government agencies — that new DACA applications were being accepted.The ruling follows one from November where Garaufis&nbsp;said&nbsp;Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf was unlawfully in his position.On Friday, the judge said that invalidated the memo Wolf had issued in July suspending DACA for new applications and reducing how long renewals were valid from two years down to one year.Wolf had issued his memo after the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in June that President Donald Trump failed to follow rule-making procedures when he tried to end the program.Garaufis also ordered the government to put together a status report on the DACA program by Jan. 4.An email seeking comment was sent to the Department of Homeland Security.“Every time the outgoing administration tried to use young immigrants as political scapegoats, they defiled the values of our nation. The court’s order makes clear that fairness, inclusion, and compassion matter,” said New York state Attorney General Letitia James, who led a number of state attorneys general in one of the lawsuits against the administration.DACA, which was started in 2012 during the Obama administration, allows certain young immigrants who were brought to the country as children to legally work and shields them from deportation. Those who are approved for it must first go through background checks and regularly renew.The Trump administration had announced the end of the program in 2017, leading to the legal challenges that wound up in front of the Supreme Court.In making its ruling, the Supreme Court upheld DACA, saying that the particular way the administration had gone about shutting it down was improper, but that the president did have the authority to do so.“Dreamers have fought so hard for justice. For the second time, a court has ordered the administration to resume processing DACA applications. It’s time to do the right thing,” Jennifer Molina, a spokesperson for President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team, said Friday. “On day one, President-elect Biden will ensure Dreamers and their families have the opportunity to live their lives free of fear and continue to contribute to our country.”About 650,000 people are currently enrolled in the program.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

“They are a good defense, and we knew that coming into it,” IR head coach Phillip Townsend said of Delmar. “They have some All-State players along that defensive line that are hard to move. We just didn’t get the job done. Turnovers killed us. I felt like as soon as we got something going [offensively], we turned the ball over. We were down in the red zone, and we fumble the ball.”
 The Indians actually out-produced the Wildcats in total offense, but both defenses really performed well in the game. IR accumulated 117 yards of total offense to Delmar’s 94.
 All told, both defenses combined to force 11 turnovers in the game.
 “I thought defensively, we played very well again,” Townsend continued. “We got some three-and-outs. I don’t think they should have scored 21 on us, but they were able to take advantage of some of our mistakes when we gave them a short field.”

Time is growing short for the NHL to meet its target of launching the 2020-21 season on Jan. 1, and the list of obstacles is growing longer. Without an agreement between the league and the NHL Players' Association by next week, the opener could be pushed back another month, slashing the schedule below the hoped-for 60 to 62 games.Negotiations hit some snags this week. According to people familiar with the discussions but not authorized to speak publicly, Commissioner Gary Bettman asked players to defer an additional 13% of their salaries next season beyond the 10% deferral they accepted in July. Players will eventually get that money back, but without interest. Bettman also proposed raising the escrow cap in each of the last three years of the labor agreement from 6% to 9%. Players previously agreed to cap escrow at 20% for 2020-21, at 14% to 18% in 2021-22, and at 10% in 2022-23.Players held a conference call Wednesday and, predictably, were unhappy about Bettman's efforts to change terms of the four-month-old labor deal to accommodate clubs' pandemic-deflated cash flow. But players want to play and owners want the league to regain a presence, so there's room for a compromise that could include Bettman sweetening the players' pot if revenues return to anything close to pre-pandemic levels.They'll have to find common ground quickly to be up and running by New Year's Day, which is already a month later than Bettman had hoped. The seven teams that missed the expanded playoffs last season and have been off the ice since early March — a group that includes the Kings and Ducks — will be allowed to start training camp a week early and have a three- week camp. To open on Jan. 1, they'd have to start around Dec. 11, followed a week later by the other 24 teams. There's little time to waste because players who went overseas will have to comply with quarantine requirements in their team's home city before they can take to the ice."The focus is still very much on Jan. 1, and the league and players are committed to making that happen," said Kelly Cheeseman, chief operating officer of AEG, the Kings' parent company. "That said, we're going to have to make some decisions here in the next week or two, and we're excited to make those decisions."Having games means having to make decisions. That's good. But the NHL's startup issues are more complex than those faced by the NBA, which crowned the Lakers as champions nearly two weeks after the Tampa Bay Lightning won the Stanley Cup but will return before the NHL, on Dec. 22.Restrictions on nonessential crossings of the U.S.-Canada border are a major problem for the NHL. The NBA has one team in Canada, the Toronto Raptors, and can relocate them to the U.S. for a season. "Obviously, we're not going to move all seven Canadian franchises south of the 49th Parallel," Bettman said during the recent Paley International Council Summit. The NHL is expected to temporarily realign and create an all-Canadian division with intradivision play. U.S.-based teams will play regionally focused schedules to minimize travel.Playing in tightly controlled bubbles like those created in Edmonton and Toronto during the playoffs is a nonstarter because players don't want to be away from loved ones for an entire season. A hub system is a possibility. "You'll play for 10 to 12 days. You'll play a bunch of games without traveling. You'll go back, go home for a week, be with your family," Bettman said. "We'll have our testing protocols and all the other things you need. It's not going to be quite as effective as a bubble, but we think we can, if we go this route, minimize the risks to the extent practical and sensible." Playing in home arenas remains owners' preference.The NHL's financial problems are intensified by its dependence on ticket revenues, one consequence of a U.S. TV deal that isn't as lucrative as those negotiated by the NFL, NBA and MLB. According to statista.com, gate revenue made up 36.6% of all NHL revenues in 2018-19; that doesn't include sales of concessions and merchandise at games. With wide distribution of a coronavirus vaccine likely a few months away, the entire season could be played without fans, a blow to clubs' bottom lines.Another complication is that playing fewer than 70 games would obligate teams to give back some of their local TV rights fees. That's an unpleasant prospect, but playing even a reduced number of games and keeping some broadcast and sponsor revenues would be better than getting no revenues at all.As recently as late September, before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final, Bettman said he anticipated the 2020-21 season would feature a full, 82-game schedule. That was never realistic. Like the rest of us, he has had to become flexible. That should apply to both sides as they negotiate terms for the upcoming season.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (WBRC) - COVID-19 is putting a strain on Emergency Medical Services nationwide. That’s especially true in West Alabama where a representative of one of ambulance services spoke to WBRC.Edgar Calloway, Operations Manager for Northstar Paramedic Services in Tuscaloosa said EMS services in large urban areas are dealing with many more calls related to coronavirus.Precautions in place because of COVID19 force paramedics to take more time putting on P- P-E and clean ambulances that may have transported patients with coronavirus. “Once we arrive at a hospital, potentially it takes longer to get a room, to have staff accept our patients,” Calloway said.Some of the hospitals paramedics are taking patients to are near capacity Calloway continued. “We were generally going to Birmingham which was an hour down the road. Now we are going 4 to 5 hours one way with some patients with specialty needed care because of the limited bed space.” The longer some paramedics are on the road or waiting to get a patient admitted into a hospital, means more work for other paramedics. “The limited staff we have are having to work longer hours and days which probably puts them at greater risk of catching the virus,” Calloway went on to say. Thursday three of their paramedics had to go into quarantine due to a possible COVID19 exposure.Copyright 2020 WBRC. All rights reserved.

The project included the construction of 17 “wetland cells” — which Hackett defined as a “sub-unit within a wetland” that bring diverse habitat due to variations in water depth and other characteristics.
 Work included “strategic earthwork and select ditch plugging,” Hackett said, including the addition of swales and hummocks, or mounds, which connect the wetland cells and help diversify the habitat.
 She said the project was the brainchild of Andrew Martin, program manager for Delaware Wild Lands. Martin, Hackett said, “would probably tell you it’s been in the back of his mind for years.”
 The project, from “conception to completion,” took about two years, she said. Martin “saw an opportunity to enhance the habitat” in the Long Field area and began the design. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service “took the idea and put it on paper,” Hackett said.
 Lyndon Hitchens Excavating of Frankford executed the earthwork involved in the project. Delaware Wild Lands has worked with the company in the past, Hackett said, creating a “high level of trust” between the two. In addition to the Fish and Wildlife Service, partners in the project included The Nature Conservancy in Maryland/DC and Ducks Unlimited. All of those organizations helped with funding the project, according to Hackett.
 Now that the excavation is complete, the next phase of the project will include the planting of more than 10,000 native trees and shrubs over the 80-acre Long Field, including baldcypress, Atlantic white cedar and buttonbush.
 The plants will grow into a forested wetland that will serve to clean and cool the air, slow climate change through carbon sequestration, absorb rain from heavy storms thus reducing flooding. The new trees will also help filter harmful pollutants from groundwater, Hackett said.

For example, some states have passed laws to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana intended to turn a blind eye against users while maintaining strict limits that maintain enforcement against wholesale dealers. Even with decriminalization, criminal justice authorities could still determine whether to impose civil fines, such as for consumption in a public setting or driving while under the influence, as well as mandate drug education or rehabilitation.

In severe cases, patients may think about death or suicide. It is important that if you have these feelings, you seek help immediately. You can take steps at home to combat the effects of SAD. Some people find that exercise helps them to feel better, even if it is for 30 minutes each week. Fresh air and sunshine can work wonders, too. Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Do your best to get adequate sleep by staying consistent and going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on the weekends. Avoid alcohol, caffeine and screen time in the evening before bed.
 Light therapy may be recommended as a first line of defense for those who experience fall onset SAD. Often, this type of therapy is extremely effective and is enough to help those who suffer from mild cases of fall onset SAD. It is possible that your doctor may recommend the use of antidepressants. We find that patients who have more severe cases of SAD, and those who are considering self-harm, benefit more from these medical aids. No matter what, consult your doctor before use of any type of therapy to determine which will work best for you.
 It is important to know that if you are feeling depressed, you are not alone and there is help. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

“He did not wait too long. Just before 3.00.AM trouble called in full force. From the window of his room upstairs, which directly faced the Opebi main road, Shobanjo counted four marauders but he had the cold comfort of being tucked within the safety of his apartment with darkness as his shield and a rifle as his weapon of defence. Thankfully, he had a licence to carry firearms. For some time, he had been fascinated by the reports of the exploits of Nobel Laureate Professor Wole Soyinka, as a hunter. The stories motivated him to want to be a hunter too. To actualize his dream, he applied for and secured official approval to acquire a hunting rifle, which he, accompanied by some of his friends, occasionally took to the bush in the Ijebu countryside to fire for the fun of it. The hoodlums shot at his night guard as they tried to force their way into the premises. Shobanjo was outnumbered by the criminals yet he responded defensively by opening fire on them to deny them access to house. In the thick of the shooting, he still found time to return to the annex to check on the children who were deeply frightened by the staccato of gunshots. The noise of the raging storm was not loud enough to disturb the calm sleep of his youngest child, Dolapo. The exchange of fire resumed and went on for a while.

(AP) - California certified its presidential election Friday and appointed 55 electors pledged to vote for Democrat Joe Biden, officially handing him the Electoral College majority needed to win the White House.Secretary of State Alex Padilla’s formal approval of Biden’s win in the state brought his tally of pledged electors so far to 279, according to a tally by The Associated Press. That’s just over the 270 threshold for victory.These steps in the election are often ignored formalities. But the hidden mechanics of electing a U.S. president have drawn new scrutiny this year as President Donald Trump continues to deny Biden’s victory and pursues increasingly specious legal strategies aimed at overturning the results before they are finalized.Although it’s been apparent for weeks that Biden won the presidential election, his accrual of more than 270 electors is the first step toward the White House, said Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University.“It is a legal milestone and the first milestone that has that status,” Foley said. “Everything prior to that was premised on what we call projections.”The electors named Friday will meet Dec. 14, along with counterparts in each state, to formally vote for the next president. Most states have laws binding their electors to the winner of the popular vote in their state, measures that were upheld by a Supreme Court decision this year. There have been no suggestions that any of Biden’s pledged electors would contemplate not voting for him.Results of the Electoral College vote are due to be received, and typically approved, by Congress on Jan. 6. Although lawmakers can object to accepting the electors’ votes, it would be almost impossible for Biden to be blocked at that point.The Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate would both vote separately to resolve any disputes. One already has arisen from Pennsylvania, where 75 Republican lawmakers signed a statement on Friday urging Congress to block the state’s electoral votes from being cast for Biden. But the state’s Republican U.S. senator, Pat Toomey, said soon afterward that he would not be objecting to Pennsylvania’s slate of electors, underscoring the difficulty in trying to change the election results through Congress.“As a practical matter, we know that Joe Biden is going to be inaugurated on Jan. 20,” Foley said.That was clear in the days after the election, when the count of mail ballots gradually made clear that Biden had won victories in enough states to win the Electoral College. It became even more apparent in late November, when every swing state won by Biden certified him as the winner of its elections and appointed his electors to the Electoral College. Trump has fruitlessly tried to stop those states from certifying Biden as the winner and appointing electors for the former vice president.He made no effort in deeply Democratic California, the most populous state in the nation and the trove of its largest number of electoral votes. Three more states won by Biden — Colorado, Hawaii and New Jersey — have not yet certified their results. When they do, Biden will have 306 Electoral College votes to Trump’s 232.Trump and his allies have brought at least 50 legal cases trying to overturn the results in the swing states Biden won — mainly Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. More than 30 have been rejected or dropped, according to an AP tally.Trump and his allies have also raised the far-fetched notion that Republican state legislatures in those states could appoint a rival set of electors pledged to Trump.But state Republican leaders have rejected that approach, and it would likely be futile in any case. According to federal law, both chambers of Congress would need to vote to accept a competing slate of electors. If they don’t, the electors appointed by the states’ governors — all pledged to Biden in these cases — must be used.The last remaining move to block the election would be the quixotic effort to vote down the electors in Congress.This tactic has been tried — a handful of congressional Democrats in 2000, 2004 and 2016 objected to officially making both George W. Bush and Trump president. But the numbers were not enough to block the two men from taking office.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

There’s nothing like the holiday season to remind us of the warmth and richness of family traditions. For me, though, some of the very best ones are born out of silly and unpredictable happenstance, because they always make for the best stories.
 Once upon a time, when my former husband Joe and I were married, we were given a special wedding gift that was the continuation of a lovely family tradition.
 His family were members of the Collins Memorial United Methodist Church on Bolton Road in Atlanta and one of their fellow parishioners, Mrs. Erma Warren, had a tradition of giving handmade personalized Christmas stockings to church friends in the event of marriage or the birth of a new baby.
 The stockings were lovingly crocheted by Mrs. Warren’s mother and they were all the same bright red, green and white design, with a cute Santa Claus stitched into the leg of the stocking and the recipient’s name cross stitched in white yarn across the top.
 I was thrilled to receive the stocking that made me truly feel a part of the family as mine became another addition to the matching set that spanned three generations.
 Unfortunately I, it turns out, was the last of the new additions to the family to receive one because Mrs. Warren’s mother passed away before the last three of the grandchildren were born.
 Nate, Clay and our daughter Ramsey were born into the family, each a year after the last, and were the only ones that didn’t get these special stockings.
 I always thought that was sad and imagined that in my spare time I might get around to learning how to crochet and then how to perfectly copy the stocking design and make stockings for each of them.
 It was the era of Martha Stewart, what can I say. Of course it never happened, but the intentions were pure.
 Years later, after Joe and I had divorced, it occurred to me that I should change the name on my stocking and turn it over to Ramsey so that she could continue the tradition that felt inappropriate for me, the prodigal wife.
 I was so excited by the epiphany! Both of our names had six letters so I knew it would be easy to simply change one letter at a time. No crocheting skills were required, all I had to do was stitch little white Xs. I figured it would take me just a couple of hours to change M-O-N-I-C-A to R-A-M-S-E-Y. Easy peasy Christmas morning surprise.
 I was quite proud of my mother-of-the-year plan and got started late on Christmas Eve so she would have no idea it was coming.
 It started out easy enough, as the best laid plans usually do. I carefully removed the three unneeded legs of the M and used its first leg to build the R. It was going even faster than I thought it might, so I imagine I took a moment to refill my wine glass or whatever self-rewarding beverage I was enjoying on that festive evening.
 As I started to plan the structure of the A in place of the O, I looked ahead and realized that I had made one fatal miscalculation. There was no way that I could fit an M in the meager real estate occupied by the I, it was way too wide.
 Boy, oh boy, I thought. I was going to have to take the whole name off and recalculate the pattern for her sweet name to fit, a task far beyond my late night holiday weary frame of mind.
 I decided that I would have to leave it as was and just explain to her and her dad what I had planned. I would easily find time to fix it before the next year’s Christmas morning, right?
 What was that we were saying about the best laid plans? They oft go astray, as the saying goes, so of course I never got around to fixing the name on Ramsey’s stocking. Several years ago I joked that I would try again to get to it, but she balked and said, “No, don’t change it! I like it that way because it is the way it has always been!”
 And so, in the eyes of Santa, Ramsey is and apparently forever shall be “Ronica.”
 Isn’t that the way it is with traditions?
 There is a funny part of the show Gilmore Girls that proves the point. Ramsey and I have always loved the show and the way that it compared to our own lives. In this particular part of the show, Lorelai has finally married her high school sweetheart, Christopher, who happens to be her daughter Rory’s father.
 It feels as though their nontraditional little family has finally come full circle and, as they prepare for their first Christmas together, Christopher surprises them with fancy matching store-bought stockings, the kind you picture being suited for Victorian royalty. Lorelai and Rory look at them and hold up their pitiful worn cheap stockings that they have always used and say, “We don’t need those, we have these.”
 While there is no logic other than tradition in the choice, it makes perfect sense that they would prefer those seemingly imperfect vessels of years of memories.
 What unusual traditions play out each holiday in your family? I love hearing these stories from my friends, and I know that you probably have your own. As we celebrate in the midst of this unusual year, may the quirky gifts of your seasonal traditions remind you that, as much as life changes, there are some things that will forever stay the same.
 Happy holidays to you and yours from Ronica and me.

Cherokee County Sheriff Jason Chennault said certain crimes have decreased, while others have increased, and he attributes that to COVID-19.
 "You would think that burglaries would be down because more people are home, but we haven't seen that. The biggest thing that we've probably seen is a rise in scam calls," Chennault said. "I would say we've seen a decline in DUIs and crimes like that, and that might be because people aren't out and about as often as they used to be."
 Chennault said even though the courthouse has closed twice since August due to the virus, his office has always remained open.
 "We still have to do what we have to do, and the front office - where you can walk in and see us - is only open during the week. As far as the sheriff's office, we run around the clock, 24 hours a day," Chennault said.
 The sheriff said three deputies have been quarantined because of exposure through a family member or spouse.

The good thing about airplanes' ventilation systems is that they can quickly suck contaminated particles into vents and away from passengers. However, it remains important that you not only wear a mask on a plane but also turn on your personal fan. Having the air blasting in your face may take some getting used to, but this will ideally help the air circulate a bit more efficiently. Airplanes use ventilation systems that essentially blend fresh air with recycled air, which ideally helps those systems filter the air. However, it's still important to be cautious about air travel for the time being and to keep an eye on how airplanes are updating their ventilation practices.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. health chief declared Friday that positive results from coronavirus vaccine trials mean the world “can begin to dream about the end of the pandemic,” but he said rich and powerful nations must not trample the poor and marginalized “in the stampede for vaccines.”In an address to the U.N. General Assembly’s first high-level session on the pandemic, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that while the virus can be stopped, “the path ahead remains treacherous.”The pandemic has shown humanity at “its best and worst,” he said, pointing to “inspiring acts of compassion and self-sacrifice, breathtaking feats of science and innovation, and heartwarming demonstrations of solidarity, but also disturbing signs of self-interest, blame-shifting and divisions.”Referring to the current upsurge in infections and deaths, Tedros said without naming any countries that “where science is drowned out by conspiracy theories, where solidarity is undermined by division, where sacrifice is substituted with self interest, the virus thrives, the virus spreads.”He warned in a virtual address to the high-level meeting that a vaccine “will not address the vulnerabilities that lie at its root” -- poverty, hunger, inequality and climate change, which he said must be tackled once the pandemic ends.“We cannot and we must not go back to the same exploitative patterns of production and consumption, the same disregard for the planet that sustains all life, the same cycle of panic and meddling and the same divisive politics that fueled this pandemic,” he said.On vaccines, Tedros said, “the light at the end of the tunnel is growing steadily brighter,” but vaccines “must be shared equally as global public goods, not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind.”He said WHO’s ACT-Accelerator program to quickly develop and distribute vaccines fairly “is in danger of becoming no more than a noble gesture” without major new funding.He said $4.3 billion is needed immediately to lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of vaccines and a further $23.9 billion is required for 2021. That total, Tedros said, is less than one-half of 1 percent of the $11 trillion in stimulus packages announced so far by the Group of 20, the world’s richest countries.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made a similar appeal for funding for the ACT-Accelerator at Thursday’s opening of the two-day General Assembly session. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday that Guterres is frustrated and would have liked see “a much much higher rate of investment by those countries who can.”Henrietta Fore, head of the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF, said, “When poor countries started to try to buy vaccines,” there were none available or the price was too high.UNICEF typically distributes 2 billion vaccine doses a year, she said, and once it can get COVID-19 vaccines, “We’re going to double that next year, so we need all hands on deck.”U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said three of the six vaccine candidates that the U.S. government has supported have reported promising data and “I have every reason to believe that more good news about vaccines and other countermeasures is on the way.”U.S. President Donald Trump has formally notified the U.N. of its withdrawal from WHO, which he has harshly criticized for its response to the pandemic and accused of bowing to Chinese influence.Azar criticized the lack of “transparent information sharing” about COVID-19 and WHO’s investigation of the virus’ origin. But he said he wanted health ministers to know they can count on U.S. cooperation to defeat the virus “with no strings attached,” and stressed that the U.S. “is providing to countries combating the virus more funding, equipment, and support than any other nation.”Despite years of warnings, WHO’s Tedros said, many countries were unprepared for the pandemic and assumed their health systems would protect their people. Many countries that have done best dealing with the crisis had experience responding to the outbreaks of SARS, MERS, HINI and other infectious diseases, he said.WHO has been sharply criticized for not taking a stronger and more vocal role in handling the pandemic.Tedros told the meeting that “clearly, the global system for preparedness needs attention.”He said a WHO commission established in September is reviewing international health regulations. WHO is also working with several countries on developing a pilot program in which countries agree to regular and transparent reviews of their health preparedness, he said.The pandemic also showed the need for a global system to share samples of viruses and other pathogens that cause disease to facilitate development of “medical counter-measures as global public goods” he said, welcoming Switzerland’s offer to use a high-security laboratory to manage a new biobank.Tedros also backed European Union chief Charles Michel’s proposal for an international treaty under which WHO would monitor the risks of emerging infectious diseases in animals for transmission to humans, ensure alerts of health risks, improve access to health care, and address financing needs. He said this would provide “the political underpinning” for strengthening the global health sector.The world spends $7.5 trillion on health every year, almost 10% of global GDP, Tedros said, but most of that money is spent in rich countries on treating disease rather than on “promoting and protecting health.”“We need a radical rethink on the way we view and value health,” he said.“If the world is to avoid another crisis on this scale,” Tedros said, “investments in basic public health functions, especially primary health care, are essential, and all roads should lead to universal health coverage with a strong foundation of primary health care.”___AP Medical Writer Linda A.

He called for a qualitative leap in relations, going beyond mere conflict management to a true partnership in addressing the root causes of violence. Close cooperation between the Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council is therefore necessary. The complexity of the crises requires more work with regional actors that understand the situation on the ground, he added, pointing out that his country has much experience with assisting mediation efforts. More financial and logistical support for African peace missions must be provided in a comprehensive approach for peace that covers social, economic and environmental aspects and the Union’s vision of “The Africa We Want”.

Farmers have long been seen as the heart and soul of India, where agriculture supports more than half of the country’s 1.3 billion people. But farmers have also seen their economic standing diminish over the last three decades. Once accounting for a third of India’s gross domestic product, they now produce only 15% of GDP, which is valued at $2.9 trillion a year.

“Honestly the only thing I could think of was ‘save my baby,’” Bentham said.
 It was a tale of survival, the day before Thanksgiving. Benham said Buddy was outside playing near his home off You Bet Road when something just didn’t sound right. Buddy had come face to face with a 350-pound bear.
 “I heard a growl, looked about 75-100 feet down, and the bear was dragging him by his head, had his head in his mouth,” Benham said.
 That horror sunk in but didn’t paralyze him.
 “I just ran down there, plowed into the bear, tackled it and grabbed it by the throat and started hitting it in the face and the eye until it let go,” Benham said.
 Then came the desperate dash to find a vet. The first place Benham tried, which was closest to his house, had been closed down due to a positive COVID-19 case.

Earlier this year came the surprise announcement that Dexter is returning to Showtime. The fan-favorite TV series ended with a whimper instead of a bang seven years ago, with a series finale that fans still talk about in negative tones to this day. With its return the series will be able to try and right the course and give itself a chance at redemption, and if new reports are to be believed it will definitely be taking the series back to its roots and perhaps even sooner than we thought. According to _The Illuminerdi_, the new season is scheduled to begin in January of next year and the premium cable network is targeting major talent to go up against the title killer.
 Michael C. Hall will reprise his role of Dexter for the series and going up against him will be a new character, a "50 year old man named Kurt." The outlet describes Kurt as having a season long arc for the ten-episode limited series, revealing him to be a trucker from the Northeastern part of America that owns a own the local truck stop in town and has "established himself as a beloved leader in the community." He harbors a secret though in his son Matthew which The Illuminerdi says has "created many messes" which require his father to use his wealth to clean-up. We can only assume "messes" is code for "murder victims."
 Though they have no line on casting for the part of the son Matthew, but Showtime is reportedly targeting none other than John Cusack for Kurt (having previously reached out to Tim Robbins who passed on the part). It seems like the series is getting ready to have Dexter face a pair of villains that hearken back to the strongest of its antagonists like The Ice Truck Killer and The Trinity Killer. Let's hope they hit that mark.
 "We basically do get to start from scratch," executive producer Clyde Phillips previously told _THR_. "We want this to not be Dexter season 9. Ten years have passed - or however many years have passed by the time this will air - and the show will reflect that time passage. Insofar as the ending of the show: this will have no resemblance to how the original finale was - and it's a great opportunity to write a second finale for a show, and Showtime was very gracious about that."
 Production on the _Dexter_ revival is set to begin in early 2021 with a premiere set for fall of that same year

Dr. Deborah Birx: We know masks work and we know masks work best when they are required for two reasons. One, because it sets the tone that this is our expectation of the behaviors of everyone. It's kind of like no shirt, no entry. It's the same principle. It also reinforces it because sometimes we forget. If we've left our mask in the car and the retailers are enforcing then it reminds us. It reminds us every single day that what we should be doing to protect one another. So that's why mask requirements work. They work because they remind us to do the right thing but they also work because of the physics of it. Now we know that masks not only protect you from me, but also protect us from getting COVID-19 and becoming infected during this pandemic. There is a lot of virus around. There remains a lot of virus around in Iowa so we all need to be very diligent to protect ourselves and protect our families.

Bloomberg) -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court denied President Donald Trump’s request that it hear his lawsuit seeking to decertify the state’s election results, ruling that his campaign needs to start in a lower court.
 The suit by Trump and his campaign alleged state officials and election boards in Democratic-leaning Milwaukee and Dane counties failed to follow proper procedure for issuing mail-in ballots and also accepted tens of thousands that should have been rejected based on various errors. President-elect Joe Biden won Wisconsin by around 20,000 votes.
 Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, asked the state high court to reject Trump’s suit in a filing this week, calling the president’s attempt to overturn the will of the voters is an “assault on democracy.”
 The rejection by the state’s top court comes a day after Trump filed yet another lawsuit in federal court in Wisconsin challenging the state’s entire procedure for mail-in-ballots and asking that the election’s outcome be determined by legislators instead of voters.

Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, said that the United Nations is duty-bound to help Africa weather the COVID-19 storm. The Organization should focus on a united fight against the pandemic to help bolster the African people’s health and safety defences and leverage its coordinating role in mobilizing global resources. Vaccines should be a global public good and made assessible and affordable for African countries. It is important for the United Nations and the African Union to work closely together to advance the Union’s “Silencing the Guns” initiative, he said, calling for implementation of the Joint Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security. He also underscored the need to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. This would help bring broad prosperity, promote fairness and justice and enable the African people to benefit from the progress of global governance. China stands as a true friend of African countries, as evidenced by the dispatch of eight medical teams fighting COVID-19 to the continent, as well as free military assistance worth $100 million to the African Union, he said.

But this senior class leaves the program better than they found it.
 “The brotherhood on this team, nothing can ever beat that,” said junior Anthony Costanzo. “We are losing a bunch of key guys next year, Luke, Kaden, Marcellus and all them, but now it’s time for younger kids to step up and finally fill that role. Us becoming closer as a team will definitely be key.”
 Costanzo, who was the only junior among the team’s top receivers and was fourth on the team in tackles with 27 heading into the title game, said it will be hard to see this senior class go.
 “Me and Kaden have been playing ball since we were in fifth grade so our friendship goes way, way back,” Costanzo said, “and then meeting Luke and Marcellus for the first time we all clicked instantly and we’ve all been best friends since I’ve been in high school, so them leaving it hurts, it definitely does.”
 Junior captain Connor Jones said this year’s seniors taught him that football is bigger than just a game, and believes the relationships that he has built in this program means far more than this loss.
 It also means motivation.
 “Really we just have to use this game as fire,” Jones said. “That score is gasoline and you have to light the spark in order to put on a great season next year. It’s definitely a wake-up point for us, being the first year back in 4A, a lot of us haven’t experienced this type of competition and go out and get 10 percent better everyday.”

SMITHVILLE — Smithville boys basketball started off the season with split results after the team’s first two games in the Savannah Tournament.
 The Warriors fell short against Benton 62-59 Tuesday, Dec. 1 at Savannah High School, but recovered with a 54-39 victory over Chillicothe the next night.
 Smithville had kept things even at 12-12 through the first quarter against Benton before the Cardinals outscored the Warriors by 7 points in the second to take a 30-23 lead into the break.
 Smithville responded with an 18-14 third quarter but were unable to gain ground in the final frame as the Cardinals closed out the game.
 The Warriors completely flipped the script against Chillicothe as they took an 18-4 advantage after one quarter. Senior guard Brad Schram scored three early 3-pointers on his way to a team-high 16 points.
 Schram and sophomore guard Ryker Edwards have both been the top scorers early in the season for the Warriors with Edwards getting a team-high 18 points in the first contest. Edwards also added an average of 7.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists to go along with his 16 points per game so far. Schram chipped in 13 points, two rebounds, two assists and two steals against Benton.
 Junior forward Rhett Foster was off to a hot start with 13 points on 4-of-7 shooting and five rebounds in the opener to keep Smithville close with the Cardinals throughout the contest.
 Foster went a little cold in the second game as he went 0 of 4 from the field. Senior guard Nick Dakon, junior guard Keltin Nitsche and senior forward Dante Cox helped lift the team on the offense end of the floor with 6 points each.
 Nitsche also got his teammates in position to score with six assists and Cox pulled down eight rebounds in the game. He improved his performance after filling the stat book a little too much in the first outing.
 Nitsche scored 8 points against Benton and team-highs with seven rebounds and five assists, but he also had eight turnovers. He limited that to four turnovers in the second game.
 Smithville will finish out the tournament with a fifth-place game against host Savannah 10 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 4 at Savannah High School.

The two businesses already formed a partnership in autumn of 2019 (Rosenfeld’s Expansion Partners LLC) to give the Jewish deli an operations partner for future locations. From now on, Big Fish will handle the operations of all new Rosenfeld’s locations (except in Worcester, Wicomico and Sussex Counties). This began with Rosenfeld’s newest Wilmington branch. “But I’m getting older. I didn’t really feel like opening a new location on my own,” Rosenfeld said, so he invited Big Fish to the South Bethany project.
 The Big Fish Restaurant Group has been expanding for the past several years, now owning or managing 18 restaurants, catering operations and more, in addition to various investments, like the Rosenfeld’s partnership.
 “The folks at Big Fish are big thinkers and, in my opinion, do everything incredibly well, and I think this combined concept will come off incredibly well … they make beautiful spaces and beautiful food,” Rosenfeld said. In terms of menu items, “We don’t really have anything that overlaps … We just think the market concept makes a lot of sense, because it’s both businesses putting their best foot forward,” Rosenfeld said.
 And there’s still a chance that McCabe’s famed chicken salad will be on the menu.
 “It’s not that complicated. It’s five ingredients, and the biggest thing is you have to make it 40 pounds at a time … Anything they want to continue that we did, we’re open to that,” Rebecca Mais said.
 They love how parts of their life have come full circle, such as Sugue’s father being a McCabe’s customer years ago.
 “He was so proud to tell us his sons were opening Big Fish Grill, which has always been one of our favorites in Rehoboth,” said Rebecca Mais, pleased with both restaurant groups. “They’re good quality people that also care about the community, and that’s so important to us.”
 The Maises met at University of South Carolina, where Rebecca was earning a master’s degree and Richard — hailing from Kansas City, Mo. — worked. Life brought the Maises back to her mother’s coastal hometown to oversee her family’s cottage rentals, raise a family and attempt to recreate a charming gourmet market they had once loved in Columbia, S.C.
 Opening in January of 1986, the Maises had a newborn and a new business. Over the years, they produced a younger son and a popular lunch stop.
 But Richard and Rebecca didn’t create McCabe’s to be a family legacy or burden — it was just right for them as they raised a family. They began mulling a retirement plan a few years ago. Their boys aren’t looking to become fulltime proprietors — one teaches high school locally, while the other is a collegiate coach in South Carolina.
 “They are really settled in what they were doing, and we’re really proud of them and what they’re doing,” Rebecca Mais said.
 “McCabe’s” was named for her grandparents. Her family still owns the overall York Beach Mall shopping center, the only actual commercial zone within South Bethany proper.
 McCabe’s will shut down, as always, around Dec. 31, 2020. Some 50-percent off sales have already begun. York Beach Mall is located at 34444 Coastal Highway, South Bethany.

But that just isn’t so.
 In fact, our military pretty much was limping out of the Great Depression. We featured a pitifully small amount of soldiers ready to fight, who were supplied with antiquated weapons and not even enough of them.
 We were able to mobilize our great economy and start churning out weapons pretty rapidly once war seemed likely. And after the Japanese launched their unexpected attack 79 years ago — Dec. 7, 1941, on Pearl Harbor, and around the same time or soon after in other places throughout the Pacific Theater — we had no shortage of men willing to fight, and women willing to serve the cause in uniform or on the home front.
 Still, from December 1941 until probably July 1944 — after it was clear the D-Day invasion would be a success, and that the Soviet Union was winning in a big way on the Eastern Front — the outcome had to seem in doubt for Americans.
 Think about that for a moment. Imagine today if we got in a war with another country or countries that could stand toe-to-toe with us, or at least have a lot more than just a fighting chance.
 Think about fighting a war where _losing, and all the bad stuff that comes with that,_ is a possibility. That ought to make the hairs on the back of your neck tingle a little.
 World War II was like that — the United States and the Allies started out fighting just to stay in the game, took the lead in about the beginning of the fourth quarter, and then finally pulled away in the closing minutes of the contest.
 Hopefully, we’ll never have to fight another world war, or anything like it, considering that World War II left us with 291,557 battle deaths, 113,842 other deaths in service, and 670,846 non-mortal woundings, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. And 16,112,566 Americans served in the military during World War II, a staggering number.
 France and Great Britain were once the most powerful nations in the world. But World War I beat down France, and the combination of World War I and World War II left Great Britain just a shadow of its old self.
 Fortunately, neither ended up permanently under the subjugation of the forces of evil, which could have occurred without the combined Allied effort against Germany, Japan and Italy.
 But there’s no guarantee that a future world culture clash would end up with the same kind of outcome. And even if the United States ended up on the winning side, would it mark the gradual decline of our power?
 That’s an answer we’d probably rather not face in our lifetimes, or the lifetimes of our children or grandchildren.
 Meanwhile, we still owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the soldiers who fought for America in the Revolution and World War II, and for the Union in the Civil War.
 There are obviously no living veterans from two out of those three wars. But we still have an estimated 326,000 living World War II veterans alive in the United States, and an estimated 2,000 in West Virginia, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
 Honor them accordingly.

What he probably won’t remember is that our paths crossed years before that. Unlike Shobanjo who has every reason to put pen to paper, it is unlikely that I will write my memoir. So snippets of my life will have to be gleaned from write-ups like this. Mr Shobanjo will remember a youth magazine in the early 70s called ‘Teen and Twenty’. It was around the time he left broadcasting for advertising. It was published by Mrs David, a woman who had a twin – a boy and a girl – and a vision to do a magazine for young people. The boy was in his ‘A levels’ at Kings College at the time while the girl was doing the same at Queens College. They both headed the editorial board which included classmates from the two schools. ‘Teen and Twenty’ became an instant hit among top secondary schools in Lagos. As fate would have it, I became its Associate Editor and first full time editorial staff a couple of years down the road. My job was to see to the viability of the magazine. The editorial part wasn’t much of a problem, but the commercial part was. I was after all, a naïve, shy and introverted young man who had to meet young, confident, well dressed advertising executives. People like Biodun Shobanjo. In knocking on doors, I avoided people who looked too stern or too aloof.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WBRC) - Alabama’s State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said it is not possible at this time to decrease the home quarantine time frame to seven days for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19.That’s one of the changes the CDC made this week.Dr. Harris said Alabama can’t make that change right now for a number of reasons including our high case numbers and the disparity in testing resources among different parts of the state.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended two additional options for quarantine and asked states to review their respective COVID-19 situations.The new guidelines will allow people who have come in contact to someone infected with the virus to resume normal activity after 10 days, or 7 days if they receive a negative test result. That’s down from the 14-day period recommended since the onset of the pandemic.According to CDC, 14 days remains the optimal time for home quarantine. ADPH leaders said taking options for home quarantine of less than 14 days carries attendant risks of disease, especially in Alabama’s environment of widespread community transmission, high overall percent positivity, and need to preserve testing capacity for symptomatic and high- risk individuals.ADPH leaders said they are working to make the changes needed to allow 10-day quarantine. That change will require ADPH to make changes to current processes which should be finalized before December 11.State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said, “While we would like to be able to decrease the home quarantine time frame to seven days for persons who may have been exposed to COVID-19, this is not possible at this time due to a number of reasons including our high case numbers and the disparity in testing resources among different parts of our state. &nbsp;We should not knowingly increase the percentage of possibly infectious asymptomatic persons out and about. Even though there is hope that our first doses of COVID-19 vaccine may arrive in the next two weeks, we are still months away from having enough vaccine to protect everyone. So, ADPH continues to encourage every Alabamian to stay home when possible, and to practice social distancing and wear masks when they must be out. Please protect the most vulnerable people in our state by doing the right things.”Copyright 2020 WBRC. All rights reserved.

(CNN) – Two U.S. pharmacy chains are preparing to give out COVID vaccines as soon as there’s a green light from the Food and Drug Administration.Health care workers and long-term care facility residents will be the first to get the vaccinations from CVS and Walgreens.“Our plan is to be ready to go as early as Dec. 15, waiting for the state approvals,” said Dr. Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer at CVS Health.In October, the Trump administration announced agreements with CVS and Walgreens to vaccinate residents of long-term care facilities nationwide.The pharmacy chains already have a list of those organizations.“We’ve basically got 31,000 locations where we’re going to have to be doing the vaccination and that’s about 2 million patients,” according to Brennan. “We’ll know who it is; where they are and how many patients there are.”CVS plans to send teams to each of the facilities three times in the coming months. An average team will consist of two vaccinators and one support staffer.Brennan said they’re already working out details for vaccine distribution within each state.“Once we get into sort of general distribution, I suspect that not only ourselves and Walgreens, but there’s going to be a number of other pharmacy chains and grocers who will be involved in it,” he said.“I think that using all those various outlets, we’re going to have very good penetration across the United States.”Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.

On Monday, I returned to The Marshfield Mail office feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the day.
 That morning, I picked up a copy of the newspaper and the first story that caught my eye was "Mask Up, Marshfield," written by my co-worker, Shelby Atkison. It was excellent coverage and I’m thankful to work with a great team of reporters who want to keep our community informed on big decisions like this.
 Later on that morning, I received a phone call from a concerned citizen regarding enforcement of the new mask mandate in Marshfield. She pointed out some weren't following the executive order and not wearing their masks while in a few public places. The citizen was very sweet as she talked to me about her concerns and said she understood that enforcement of the mandate would be a challenge, especially with a limited number of officers in the area, but she still wondered why nothing was being done about it.
 This citizen wasn't the only person to speak about the issue.On Monday afternoon, I noticed an email from someone, stating the masks don’t work because you can get the virus anyways.
 Everyone's entitled to their own opinion and I try to be open to them, as that's my job as a reporter — to listen. I'm a firm believer in Jesus Christ and I know he can deliver us from the coronavirus if he wanted to. That’s what I keep praying all the time — that God will heal our land and guide our doctors and scientists in developing a vaccine.
 It has been a hard year on people and I fully agree with wanting to return to normal again. I get exhausted with the coronavirus talk and pray against news claiming we’re going to be stuck at home for several more months. The last thing our country needs is another shutdown.
 Am I exhausted from wearing masks all the time? Yes and I’m praying we’re not stuck wearing them forever. In fact, I believe God will bring about good things in the coming year. We’ll see the light at the end of the tunnel.
 I want to be able to go around and enjoy time with people without having a piece of cloth confined to my face. I want to celebrate a new chapter in my life without limiting the number of guests who attend that special day.
 I don't want to live in fear about the future because I know I'm in God's loving hands.
 Yet I want to be respectful of the guidelines. I keep a mask in my purse, just in case I’m traveling out and about with people. My Dad's health is getting better and the last thing I want is to hinder his progress by catching a cold (or any sickness for that matter).
 Prior to our early Thanksgiving celebration, Mom and I prayed for protection over our loved ones gathered there (and we only had seven). We haven't stopped praying that when we gather together.
 God's going to get us through this. Until then, we shouldn't stop praying for each other and we should pray for God's wisdom over our local city officials. This wasn’t an easy call for them to make regarding the mask ordinance, but let’s do our part and help take care of those around us.

Greatly value our multifaceted relations based on shared culture and history. Thailand is a key partner in our Act East Policy."   Last month, a two-day long trilateral naval exercise, SITMEX-2020, involving India, Singapore and Thailand was held in the Andaman Sea.  
 It was scheduled in a "non-contact, at sea only format", in wake of the COVID-19 restrictions.   The primary aim of the exercise was to further consolidate interoperability between the three navies and also enhance understanding, sharing best practices and procedures for multi-faceted maritime operations.   This edition of the exercise involved a war-at-sea exercise, naval manoeuvres, weapon firing on the surface and aerial targets, seamanship evolutions, and coordinated navigation operations. (ANI)

Located in Belleville, Hospice Quinte provides service and care for terminally ill residents throughout Quinte West, Belleville, Deseronto, Tyendinaga Township, and the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory.
 On Thursday, Hospice Quinte's Heart & Home Building Campaign received a $25,000 boost from the local business and financial professionals at Wilkinson & Company LLP.
 For over 10 years, Hospice Quinte has been planning to expand its services and address the need for a community-based Hospice Quinte Care Centre. The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care has approved moving forward with a six- bed Hospice Quinte Care Centre Hospice Quinte's Heart & Home Building Campaign helps to support the construction of the new Hospice Quinte Care Centre.
 "We are honoured to receive this thoughtful gift by Wilkinson's," said Hospice Quinte executive director, Jennifer May-Anderson. "The company's generous donation will go a long way toward helping us to reach the $9.5M capital campaign goal and we are so very grateful for their benevolence."
 Volunteers and staff at Hospice Quinte provide passionate care and comfort for residents and their loved ones free of charge to residents within the service areas. Hospice Quinte is a charitable not-for-profit organization and relies on relationships with individuals, businesses, and charitable foundations in the community.
 Wilkinson & Company LLP founder Wilfrid Wilkinson began promoting the important community care, charitable giving and a `goodwill to all' attitude among his staff in 1964. This benevolent mindset is something the company partners and staff continue to foster today.
 "It gives our team great joy to donate to the Heart & Home Building Campaign. The essential services that will be provided by the future Hospice Quinte Care Centre are desperately needed in our community," said Wilkinson business partner Kris Himberg-Larsen. "With construction of the facility now fully underway, we saw an opportunity to give a gift that's needed in order to bring this vital community project to fruition."
 Wilkinson & Company LLP will be recognized at the new centre in the executive director's office where a commemorative plaque will be placed to acknowledge and remember the company's contribution.
 The new, six-bed Hospice Quinte Care Centre located in Bayside will be a safe, comfortable, quiet and welcoming place that feels as close to home as possible. Professional palliative care will be provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at no cost to the individual or family.

Opening the meeting, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres stressed that the partnership between the United Nations, the African Union and African regional economic mechanisms has never been stronger. It is anchored in the principles of complementarity, respect for African leadership and the certainty that no one organization or State can face problems alone, he said, spotlighting how the continent has shown exemplary leadership on meeting the COVID-19 challenge. As well, the United Nations is supporting the initiative, “Silence the Guns in Africa by 2020”, in many concrete ways, including capacity‑building for mediation and disarmament, partnership in creating the network of African women leaders and investment in young people. This is in addition to broadening operational support for the African Union, he added.

Seasons may change, but the need to be prepared for any season remains the same.
 The Sussex County Emergency Operations Center reminds the public that hazard preparation is a year-round necessity, whether it’s ahead of hurricane season that officially just ended — 2020 was the most active season ever recorded — or the nor’easter season that typically runs from now to mid-March. As the calendar turns to the colder months, residents and property owners are encouraged to check supplies, monitor weather conditions, and take appropriate action if directed this winter season.
 “This year is certainly one for the record books on many levels, whether it’s the ongoing pandemic or the unprecedented hurricane season of 27 named systems, three of which affected us here in Sussex County — Fay, Isaias and Zeta,” Sussex County EOC Director Joseph L. Thomas said. “I know everyone is ready for a break, but we cannot take a break from readiness, no matter the season. Winter storms, particularly nor’easters, bring us some of our most intense weather each year. So we urge the public to take stock of their supplies and readiness plans now in case the winter months ahead are as challenging as the rest of 2020 has been for all of us.”

Hondru’s ryb on a fake punt in the fourth quarter secured a first down and put the final nail in the coffin of Upper St. Clair, one of the Indians’ most important victories of the regular season..
 “Growing up I always played lineman,” said Hondru. “That’s where I learned how to block. I grew, got stronger and that’s when I got better. I just put it all together.”
 Hondru, who stands 6-2 and weighs 210 pounds, models his game after linebacker Luke Kuechly, who retired from the Carolina Panthers this year after an eight- year NFL career.
 “We were building brick by brick, climbing the mountain,” Hondru said of the Indians’ emergence over the past four years. “Our sophomore year, we had about four guys starting. This year, we had a lot of seniors starting.”
 Hondru was an early commit to Miami of Ohio, a school that seemed like home to him.
 “It’s the best of both worlds,” said Hondru. “They compete every game, every practice. They want to win championships. The coaches are a little old school. They will scream at you and I love that. The education is top-rate.”
 Still, he says he will miss his teammates and the coaching staff, especially head coach TJ Plack. The Indians made two appearances in the WPIAL finals, losing to Gateway by a point last year and falling to eventual WPIAL and PIAA champion Pine-Richland.
 “I enjoyed the time I had with him,” Hondru said. “He’s a great coach. He has a great football mind. He could always get us motivated. When we were younger, he would tell us we were the underdogs. He believed in us. Even last year, at the beginning, no one believed in us and this year, we ran with him and trusted him. He led us the entire way and I can’t thank him enough.”
 “He does everything. I can sit here and tell you all these things about him, but it comes down to this: He does all these things almost perfect,” said Plack. “He never misses a workout. He’s always on time, if not early. He’s the type of guy I hope my daughter meets some day. He does everything for us and he does it flawlessly. Boy, we’re going to miss him.”
 Hondru’s biggest play of the season came in the WPIAL Class 5A semifinals at Gateway. He made the game-winning catch in a 20-19 victory, hauling in a rocket from Pfeuffer with four seconds to play in the game on a skinny post pattern. It capped a thrilling second-half comeback by the Indians, who trailed 19-0.
 “Just catching the ball and looking at the sideline and all my teammates going crazy, it was an amazing feeling,” Hondru said.
 “He’s the best high school player I’ve been around,” Plack said of Hondru after the Gateway game. “He’s absolutely tenacious, an Alpha Male, intelligent. He does everything right.”
 McMillon made a spectacular TD catch in that game, laying out for the football in the end zone. It was the kind of play McMillon has been making for the Indians for the past three years.
 “I loved playing with Donovan,” he said. “His sophomore year, they threw him in there and he just took off. It was awesome. He’s a great player, great teammate and great friend of mine.”
 To get away from football, Hondru doesn’t hunt or fish like some of his friends. He turns to other sports such as lacrosse or basketball.
 “I’m obsessed with sports,” Hondru said. “I’ve been playing sports all my life. I’m a sports fanatic. If I want to get away from football, I go to other sports. I love to compete.”
 Hondru is carrying on a family tradition of achievers. His mother swam at John Carroll, where she was team captain, his sister, Kate, played softball at the University of Delaware, his father and uncle also played football at Delaware, another uncle played football and wrestled at Princeton and his grandfather was among Joe Paterno’s first recruiting class before getting a shot at the NFL.
 “Hopefully, I can keep the Hondru tradition going in college,” he said.

BOSSIER CITY, La. – President Donald Trump has signed a law renaming the Mansfield Post Office after civil rights leader and former state legislator Dr. C.O. Simpkins Sr., U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Rep. Mike Johnson (LA-04) announced jointly Friday afternoon.
 Born in Mansfield and raised in Shreveport, Simpkins was a fighter for voting rights for African American Louisianans and worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King throughout the civil rights era. Simpkins was a founder of the United Christian Conference on Registration and Voting, and was an advocate for peaceful protest through nonviolence and civil disobedience.
 Although he and his family had to flee Louisiana during the height of civil rights tensions, he returned home 26 years later to practice dentistry and served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1992-1996. He continued to be active member in the community until his passing at age 94 last December.
 “Dr. Simpkins dedicated his life to promoting civil rights in Louisiana and across our great nation. His courage to speak out on behalf of the marginalized will forever be remembered. I’m proud to play a part in securing this designation,” said Cassidy.
 “We were so happy to honor the life and legacy of Dr. C.O. Simpkins by officially naming a U.S. Post Office for him in his hometown of Mansfield. The strong support we have received for this symbolic gesture shows once again our area’s tremendous appreciation for Dr. Simpkins’ service to our community, state and country. I want to thank Senator Cassidy for partnering with me on this special legislation and President Trump for signing it into law,” said Johnson.

James Duddridge, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and Minister for Africa of the United Kingdom, highlighted his country’s support for the African Union’s Continental Early Warning System. However, accurate and timely information needs to be coupled with plans for effective early action, at State, regional or continental level. The African Union’s support of elections in Madagascar two years ago and mediation in Sudan last year were impressive examples of what that organization can do. Yet, in other cases, action from the African Union or the United Nations has come too late or not at all. The key to greater shared success is consistency in approach. When conflicts do emerge, the United Nations and the African Union bring complementary skills to the table. He expressed his concern over the situation in Tigray, noting that the immediate priorities are to secure greater humanitarian access and to ensure the protection of civilians and human rights. His Government will continue to support African Union-led efforts, he said, urging all parties to accept credible offers of support to establish the conditions for a sustainable political solution.

For those playing Monday night, players can return to their facilities on Thursday, and for Thursday night games, teams must close their complexes until Sunday.
 But there are some exceptions. The only ones allowed inside the complex during the closing period are players needing medical attention or in rehab programs. Coaches are also given the green light to work in their own offices but can only conduct meetings virtually.
 Traveling is also changing. The NFL lifted the 62-player game travel limit for teams. Each team can determine how many players to take to road games, including the practice squad players. This latest decision should help with filling out the 48 man roster in case of issues with the coronavirus on game days.
 While the New England Patriots are one of those teams traveling this weekend, cornerback Jason McCourty told Western Mass News it will be a different road trip amid the pandemic.
 "The rest of our season, we have to, kind of, have that doe-or-die mentality," said Patriots captain Matthew Slater. "Every game has to be treated like it's the most important game of the year, especially starting with the chargers."
 The Patriots will take on the Los Angeles Chargers for a 4:25 p.m. kick-off time and will have a quick turn around, looking ahead to face the Rams the following Thursday.

There was also a need for predictable financing through assessed contributions for African Union peace support operations.

Most of these buildings already have HVAC systems with filters. It's crucial that these systems are regularly serviced with professional guidance and governmental oversight in light of the pandemic. It's generally been advised that these systems increased their filtration and ventilation as a rule. But every building is different, and the systems need to be altered to fit the needs of those buildings.

“We’ve been preaching to the guys all offseason to play smart and tough,” Central Coosa coach Richard Bell said. “I think we did a good job of that (Thursday night) considering we haven’t practiced in two weeks. We did a good job of moving the ball around and playing together — and that’s what you want to see.”
 According to Bell, defense is going to have to be the key to success this season after graduating multiple scoring options.
 “We lost a lot of good players over the last couple years,” Bell said, “so we lost some of our offensive firepower. The best thing for this team right now is hustling on defense to set ourselves up on the other end.”
 Demarcus Sandlin was all over the place for the Cougars, scoring 28 points en route to a double-double on the night to go along with his handful of steals. Demarcus wasn’t the only Sandlin that had a good night; Tacoryan Sandlin balled out as well with seven rebounds and 16 points on Thursday. The Sandlins also had some help from their guards Dequaion Thomas and Jon Kelly. Kelly is the floor general for the Cougars, leading the team in assists with six and scoring seven points. Thomas was hot from three all night, scoring 18 points to go along with his four assists and two steals.
 As well as his guards played, Bell still wants to see his young playmakers be more consistent through four quarters rather than in spurts.

Citing the importance of investing in vaccines, he observed positive results in recent weeks reveal “the light at the end of the tunnel is growing steadily brighter.” However, we cannot accept a world where the poor and marginalized are stampeded by the rich and powerful in the rush for vaccines. In April, WHO established the Access to COVID‑19 Tools (ACT)‑Accelerator to deliver them and has already secured 120 million low-cost rapid tests and other provisions, with 189 countries and economies also participating in the COVAX Facility. However, he noted the ACT‑Accelerator faces a $4.3 billion funding gap, with a further $23.9 billion required in 2021 — just half of 1 per cent of the $11 trillion in stimulus announced by the Group of 20 (G‑20) countries thus far. Sharing the fruits of science is not charity, he said, but in the interests of every nation. Calling for investment in preparedness to prevent the next pandemic, he noted those States that previously experienced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the influenza A virus (H1N1) fared better, and all must “develop that muscle memory”, he said. WHO is engaging with several countries to prepare a Universal Health and Preparedness Review, and he noted Switzerland is providing a high‑security lab for a biobank.

“All of my guards are 10th and ninth-graders,” Bell said. “They start to dribble to one side and if they don’t see what they want — they force it. That’s what we are going to work on before our next game, keeping the offense in motion and free flowing. We need to value each possession and that’ll come with time.”
 Bell said he has been putting an emphasis on playing each game as hard as they can. Due to complications with the coronavirus, the schedule has been limited to just 10 games, so each game matters more than in a regular season.
 “We don’t know how many games we will be able to get in, so I really want those seniors to get a few games under their belt before anything goes off,” Bell said. “We only have nine games left, so we can’t drop one. Overall I thought we played well (Thursday night) but we got some things we need to work on Monday.”
 Central Coosa’s next game will be at home Wednesday, Dec. 9 versus Horseshoe Bend.
