Investigators have concluded that Dolloff was acting as a security guard at the time of the incident, according to a tweet from the Denver Police Department (DPD). It reads, in part, “further investigation has revealed that, at the time of the shooting, the suspect was acting in a professional capacity as an armed security guard for a local media outlet and not a protest participant.”

Perú llegó este domingo a casi 850.000 casos de COVID-19, aunque solo poco más de 72.000 de estos están activos en la actualidad, y a 33.305 fallecidos, según el último informe del Ministerio de Salud (Minsa). En las últimas 24 horas se detectaron 1.076 nuevos infectados, con lo que el total ascendió a 849.371 desde que se reportó el primer caso de la enfermedad en el país, el pasado 6 de marzo.   De esa cifra total, 743.969 personas ya han sido dadas de alta en un centro médico o han cumplido su cuarentena domiciliaria, y los fallecidos llegaron a 33.305, con 82 nuevos decesos. Además, los pacientes hospitalizados son actualmente 6.291, de los cuales 1.210 se encuentran en unidades de cuidados intensivos (UCI) con ventilación mecánica.  Al respecto, la ministra de Salud, Pilar Mazzetti, aseguró que aunque las cifras de contagiados, hospitalizados y fallecidos se han estabilizado, seguirán incrementándose porque la epidemia sigue presente en el país. “La pandemia no ha terminado. El virus está con nosotros. La transmisión en estos momentos es menor, pero el virus está con nosotros”, remarcó. Mazzetti agregó que “desafortunadamente” se calcula que Perú, muy probablemente, mantendrá alrededor de 100 decesos diarios por la pandemia. La ministra también comentó que los niños aún no han sido incluidos en la preparación del esquema de vacunación con la futura vacuna contra la COVID-19 porque primero se tendrá que aprobar una que tenga “las condiciones de seguridad” necesarias para ellos. “Apenas tengamos vacuna probada en niños, procederemos a la vacunación en los niños”, remarcó.  Este domingo se informó de que las autoridades sanitarias de Perú ya han firmado acuerdos no vinculantes con 11 laboratorios internacionales, de un total de 13 con los que mantienen conversaciones para asegurar la futura provisión de vacunas contra la COVID-19. “Perú está abierto a todas las posibilidades de adquisición y seguirá avanzando en las negociaciones en la medida que los laboratorios farmacéuticos vayan dándonos más precisiones sobre el avance del desarrollo de sus vacunas, principalmente en su seguridad y efectividad y el cronograma de entrega”, explicó el doctor Carlos Castillo, asesor de Inmunizaciones y Vacunaciones del Minsa. Recordó que Perú ha iniciado la firma de acuerdos vinculantes con la coalición Covax Facility y con el laboratorio Pfizer, que ya han brindado “más información y certeza” sobre las condiciones que brindarán al momento de la adquisición formal. “En la medida que los desarrolladores de vacuna con los que se tienen acuerdos no vinculantes nos brinden más información y detalles técnicos, el país puede firmar nuevos acuerdos vinculantes”, acotó el especialista.  Por otra parte, el Colegio Médico del Perú (CMP) informó de que al menos uno de cada 200 médicos en actividad durante la pandemia ha perdido la vida en el país. Según un reporte publicado por el diario El Comercio, los médicos fallecidos son 223, de un total de 4.245 especialistas que se contagiaron con el virus, mientras que 76 siguen internados en unidades de cuidados intensivos. Por ese motivo, el decano del CMP, Miguel Palacios, quien se ha recuperado tras padecer la enfermedad, pidió al Ministerio de Salud que refuerce las medidas de seguridad sanitaria y la distribución de equipos de protección personal para los médicos. Perú es actualmente el octavo país del mundo con más casos de la COVID-19 y el primero del mundo en tasa de mortalidad. EFE

The real estate sector has witnessed a substantial decline in residential sales, particularly during the first two quarters of 2020 amid the onset of the novel coronavirus and subsequent lockdowns.          However, the worst seems to be over for the residential sector as housing sales have increased substantially during the quarter ending September (Q3).          The value of houses sold in the top-seven cities in Q3 2020 collectively rose to Rs 29,731 crore against Rs 12,694 crore in the preceding quarter – a significant quarter-on-quarter jump of 134 percent. It still has some way to go to reach the level of Rs 46,306 crore in the pre-COVID-19 quarter. Let's find out if the worst is over for the real estate sector and if these numbers indicate recovery.

Williams was born in Germany and her family emigrated to Australia in 1960 when she was still a toddler. She hails from a family steeped in the tradition of painting churches and frescoes. She admits to always having had an innate feeling that a career in art was the only possible path for her. What’s impressive about Williams is the fact that she has no formal training in art. In the musical world, she is what one might call a prodigy. By the age of fourteen, her teachers were buying her paintings. After dropping out of school, and pushing through a difficult time in her life where she worked as a hairdresser for two decades, Williams navigated back to her comfort zone and began painting on porcelain as well as painting in watercolor on paper in 1989. She was living in Canberra, Australia. In 1997 to 1998, Williams was the president of the Australian Capital Territory Porcelain Painters Association. In 1998, she subsequently founded and was president of the Australian Capital Territory On-glaze Artists Association Inc. By 2001, Williams orchestrated a major 3-month exhibition and concurrent educational program at the Canberra Museums and Gallery, “Porcelain Art into the New Millennium,” curated by Director Peter Haynes.

 Delhi have been hit by a spate of injuries this season. Ishant didn't start for Delhi in their IPL opener on September 20 and in the very first match off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin suffered a shoulder injury that kept him out of the next two matches.
 Moreover, wicket-keeper batsman Rishabh Pant didn't play the Mumbai game on Sunday due to a hamstring injury. Alex Carey replaced Pant behind the stumps.
 Captain Shreyas Iyer has said that Pant has been advised by the doctor to “rest for a week” meaning the left-hander may miss some of the team's remaining seven matches.

The COVID-19 pandemic sent a lot of entertainers and venues scrambling to acquire new technology. St. John’s was ahead of the curve. The church at 679 Farmington Ave. had webcasting equipment installed before anyone had ever heard of coronavirus, and long before the state locked down in mid-March.                                                       “We already started livestreaming church services and concerts to folks in Duncaster and other retirement communities,” Lamlein said. “We had no idea we would be using it for our main way to reach people.”                                                                                                                                                                     So The Red Door pivoted to all-virtual concerts more quickly than most. Since the quarantine began, St. John’s has streamed 19 concerts, using them to raise money for charities that fight food scarcity.                                                       “People have just been so grateful that something was happening that they could tune in to live,” Lamlein said. “People have been tuning in from across the country.

Her family went to St. John’s when she was a child. In her senior year at Conard High, she had a cello recital in the church sanctuary. “That was almost 20 years ago and that was the last time I set foot in the church,” she said.                                                       After Conard, Metcalf attended Boston University, then Mannes School of Music at The New School in New York. She lives in Manhattan with Boyd, a native of Australia, who is her husband as well as her partner, and their 2-year-old son Milo.

There is a not a lot of music originally composed for a duo like that. As a result, we do a lot of arranging of classical and nonclassical works,” she said. “We are both classically trained, but good music is good music regardless of the genre.”

As a result of stark contrast in consumer behavior and stringent regulations across the world pertaining to transportation during the pandemic, the global packaging sector is going through a turbulent phase. This is expected to reflect in the growth of the Destructible Security Labels market, as operations are limited to essential activities and products, thereby creating a huge void in packaging needs for non-essential commodities. On this premise, the global Destructible Security Labels market will experience a downtrend through the pandemic. Further complicating smooth operations are hindered operations and travel bans across the world. On the back of these factors, players operating in the global Destructible Security Labels market are expected to experience a steep decline in revenue flow.

Jake was ready to squeeze the trigger when he heard a louder noise – a buck on the run through the woods. Jake shot one round that missed, but soon the buck was running back toward Jake. He tried to get the buck’s attention and finally decided to yell really loud and the buck froze. The shot Jake took next got him. He was so heavy that the four-wheeler lifted up when the buck was strung up in a tree.

“I got really nervous. I moved as slowly as I could, turned carefully and took a shot, dropped a doe,” he said. “It was the coolest thing ever, the biggest rush ever. I put my thumb up in the air to show my uncle who was across the field and he stuck his thumb in the air too. It was super cool — a memory I’ll never forget.”
 It was also Jake’s first time to field dress a deer.
 “That was an experience I’ll never forget,” he said. “The smell is distinct.”
 The Friedrichs family does their own butchering and processing at home.
 “The shooting part is the easiest part,” Jake said. “It takes hours and hours over two to three days with all the quartering, wrapping and splitting up the meat between us.”
 When it comes to making sausage, the pork is purchased ahead of time. The venison is ground and spread out on a tabletop, it is mixed by hand with the pork and seasonings. With eight hands on the job, it’s doesn’t take so long. Jake, Michael, mom Lynn and John all pitch in.
 Any hunter has unlikely stories to share and Jake is no exception. While making a quick midday stop to let the dog out at his brother’s house in 2019, Jake decided to look in the woods there. He closed his car door quietly and went looking.
 ”I saw a doe get up and I was just about to shoot when a buck decided to get up as well and follow the doe. They went in a low spot and I lost sight of both. Eventually the doe walked up out of the low spot and the buck followed. I took the buck down and called my family and not one of them believed me — that I had a large buck on the ground,” Jake said.
 Looking back to an earlier hunt, the largest deer Jake shot was in 2008. He was alone in a stand when he heard footsteps behind him. The doe trotted under the stand. Jake was ready to squeeze the trigger when he heard a louder noise.
 “I looked down and saw nothing but antlers. The buck was on a dead run through the woods. I fired one round off. I missed and was more than saddened. Seconds later the noise came back and it was him running back in my general direction. I tried to grunt but nothing worked so I decided to yell really loud and he froze. That is when I put him down. He was so heavy, when we strung him up in the tree he lifted the four-wheeler up.”

In 2017 during the course of the year from when the second republic came into power a drastic infringement of labour laws have been the order of the day as the government fails to pay its workers a living wage. Educators are a big chunk of the civil servants affected. The nature of the job for educators makes their situation worse and unbearable as there cannot be arrangements for them for instance to work twice a week, or exchange duties. It means they have to be present at work to deliver their services each and every day. Now they are failing to be there not because of their own design but because they simply cannot afford. Their paltry salaries just cannot sustain. To the responsible authorities now that there is this crisis whereby an educator just cannot afford to be at work my heart bleeds to note that someone is dismally affected. Someone is being robbed here and that someone is the future. It is the child whose rights have been robbed at the end of the day. The right to education has been violated.

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss                     BOSTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Investment firm PrimeStone is pressing medical device maker LivaNova PLC to consider strategic options including selling parts of its business, refreshing its board and hiring a new finance chief, saying such steps could double its share price.                     London-based PrimeStone said that years of underperformance required a new strategic direction and that the company should divest its Cardiopulmonary business, sell or close its Heart Valves business, and consider appointing a new board chairman and hiring a new chief financial officer, according to a letter the investment firm is sending to LivaNova's board on Monday.                     PrimeStone said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters, that LivaNova's share price could "more than double to $100", adding: "However, to get there, several changes need to take place."                     The investment firm is urging the company to focus on its Neuromodulation unit.                     LivaNova did not immediately respond to a request for comment.                     PrimeStone, founded by three former partners at private equity firm Carlyle Group, said in the letter that it owned roughly 2.2% of LivaNova. The investment has not been previously reported.                     The investment firm said in the letter that it has been a patient investor. But it added that total shareholder return for LivaNova investors since 2015 has been -17% compared with a +171% for its peers during that period.                     Private negotiations between PrimeStone and LivaNova broke down in August, according to the letter, because LivaNova's board chairman wanted to reach a higher share price through "beat and raise" earnings releases.                     LivaNova, which has a market capitalization of $2.4 billion, was created five years ago through a merger of Cyberonics and Storin. In the last 52 weeks, its share price has fallen 28%. It closed trading at $50.06 on Friday.                     PrimeStone said in the letter that it expects other shareholders to support its suggestions that could "help restore the Company's credibility and get it on the path of significant value creation."

It never is an easy task to help people transition to the knowledge that there is no going back. The only way is to go forward.

After Lewis Hamilton drew level with Michael Schumacher at the top of the standings for the most Formula One victories, debate rages over which driver is the sport’s greatest of all time. While Hamilton sits joint-top, in many’s eyes he has some way to go to reach the heights of his predecessors. Due to technological advancements and alterations in the teams, calendar and tracks, it is nigh on impossible to compare drivers from different eras. In no particular order, here is our selection of the best over the years.

Studio clay tends to be stored in plastic bags these days. When it is frozen and then thaws out again, there is some water in the bag. This may make the clay appear as if something is wrong with it. In fact, though, the only thing wrong is the gooey wet surface of the clay we see in the bag is the outside of a block of clay that’s now drier on the inside than it was before freezing. The freeze/thaw cycle has changed the distribution of water in the body. Thorough wedging to remix the moisture so it is uniform throughout the body will have it looking and working like new again.

Hunting is something Jake never misses if at all possible. During his six years serving in the National Guard, he was deployed to Iraq in 2011 and 2012, and had to miss hunting.
 “There’s always something to hunt,” he said. “There’s nothing better than bacon-wrapped duck or goose.”
 Compared to hunting deer, “duck hunting is a whole other animal. It’s about getting up between 1 a.m. - 4 a.m. to get to out spot on public land. Sometimes, we camp out there the night before,” Jake said. “It’s a long process to put out dozens of decoys.”
 A duck hunter has to make sure the calls are right. Decoys have to be set the right way.
 “There are so many things that can go wrong. In the end, even though everything is perfect, they might just decide to fly over without stopping,” he said.
 While ducks can be found mostly in swamps and sloughs, geese like fields more. Jake also hunts pheasants and sometimes grouse. Most of his bird hunting buddies are friends from the Guard.
 During a goose hunt in November 2014, near Rochester, Jake and some buddies who were in Iraq with him were able to hunt with well-known hunters and guide service including Scott Threinen and Robbie Iverson, “two of the best goose callers in the world. We hunted out of dug-in pit blinds in the field. It was at this hunt I realized that no matter how good you are at calling or setting up, geese can just fly away for no good reason,” Jake said.
 Jake also hunts coyotes.
 “They are a huge nuisance. They kill a lot of fawns,” he said. “They have amazing eyes and can smell really well. I enjoy the challenge.”
 The best time to go after coyotes is during a full moon (or early in the morning) when there is snow on the ground. They are much easier to see then.
 One coyote-hunting tournament Jake went to was near Montevideo. He remembers one of the best shots he has ever made. He was sitting next to an old silo that was halfway fallen down. His electric caller died so he decided to use hand calls for the first time. He used a couple of quick barks and howls and after 15 minutes of calling he saw a coyote at a dead sprint at 300 yards. He stood up and let two quick shots off with his .223 and hit the coyote with both rounds. The coyote took third place in the tournament.
 No matter how well a hunt goes, what matters most to Jake are the laughs, the memories.
 “I have a passion for hunting for the bonding with friends. I get more joy now seeing people get their first deer. I like to bring people along who have never been hunting,” he said. “I can’t remember one duck I’ve shot, but I can remember the memories made in the duck blind.”

Daniel Carlson converted field goal attempts of 38 and 43 yards and is 12-for-13 this season. He did miss an extra point, which could have been a body blow had the Raiders not played such good defense and held the ball for so long in the second half. A.J. Cole punted only twice but it was for a 53-yard net and gross, placing one inside the 20-yard line. There was no punt or kickoff return damage to speak of inflicted by either team. A penalty pushed the Raiders from the 10 to the 5 following a Chiefs punt. An illegal block by Nicholas Morrow on a kickoff was responsible for another drive starting at the 9.

The artists, designers, and architects associated with Constructivist ideals after World War I were interested in a pure style that let go of detail and connected to industry in a fluid way. They dismissed classical representation of history and nature in favor of abstracted geometric patterns. The changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution were in full swing and trains, automobiles, and soon airplanes were shifting people’s notions of labor, speed, time, and space. The Constructivists pursued a vision of equity, but ironically its clean-slate approach to history played well with the totalitarian impulse behind Brutalism. This disjunction provides a meaningful and complex ground for exploration.
