NORFOLK — It will be a different world when students return for in-person instruction in September at Norwood-Norfolk Central School.
 Students who ride the bus could each be assigned to separate seats, unless they’re family members.
 Wall lockers will be closed to students who would normally use them for storing their books and other materials.
 Elementary students taking part in recess may not have use of the playground equipment.
 Students will need to be 12 feet apart in their physical education classes.
 It’s the new world brought about by COVID-19.
 Those were among the topics addressed by Superintendent James Cruikshank during a Zoom meeting with parents, administrators, teachers and board of education members.
 Assigning one student per bus seat will allow students to have proper social distancing, he said.
 “All our buses have higher back seats. We are looking at doing one student per seat unless you live together,” he said.
 Mr. Cruikshank said supply lists for classes was a subject that was still up in the air.
 “We’re going to look at the supply lists. We have to start talking with teachers. Let’s take a look at what you need because you can’t have kids just piling eight binders in their backpack. One of the things that we’re going to get away from at the upper level is lockers. We can’t have any points with a lot of kids converging, and we can’t socially distance at lockers,” he said.
 One option to alleviate the heavy backpack load would be the use of Chromebooks and ebooks, but those come with a cost, he said.
 “Obviously, with more things going online, there’s less of a dependence on textbooks. We’ve been filtering off textbooks for a while. Not every teacher can do that, not every subject area can do that. But that is something that we are looking at,” Mr. Cruikshank said.
 “When I say that, I see dollar signs popping out there and we’re under kind of a fiscal crisis right now. But we don’t want kids walking around with backpacks that are 80 pounds. That’s on us. We have to figure it out,” he said.
 Mr. Cruikshank also discussed how COVID-19 would impact recess.
 “We’re still unsure about playgrounds because those are all high touch surfaces. We know they have to get outside. We’re going to try to encourage outside, whether it’s recess or science class or what have you, and socially distance as we can. We have a lot of fields around here. We can use those fields. We need to spread them out as best as possible,” he said.
 But, then the question becomes, how do you manage a class that’s spread apart to maintain social distancing.
 “We have to educate our kids, when it’s recess these are the rules, these are the allowables. I want to say they’re going to be on the playground. (But) right now I’ve received almost no guidance on playground equipment,” he said.
 Physical education classes will also look different in the fall, with students required to stay 12 feet away from each other and taking part in activities that don’t require close proximity to each other.
 “I know our high school does archery. We’re not going to do 180 days of archery, but there are things that they can do,” Mr. Cruikshank said.
 The 12-foot distance also impacts performance arts like music, chorus and band, he said.
 There was some concern about extracurricular activities for students who were taking part in remote learning from their homes.
 “We want them to be able to participate in everything that a student attending in person would be. Transportation is a big issue. I don’t necessarily have a solution for that. But, I want to say that if parents can help us with transportation, awesome. We want kids to participate,” he said.
 “If they’re 100 percent remote, we’re going to do our best to accommodate students. I think there’s a lot of questions to the actual logistics. There will be challenges and we’re going to have to be flexible with your needs and you’re going to have to be flexible with our needs. Really, we all want the same thing — we want our kids to participate,” Mr. Cruikshank said.
 Students taking part in remote learning from home will be part of the day’s attendance count, and will participate in virtual classes during the day.
 “Remote instruction won’t look like it did in the spring. The guidance says we have to do one thing, and that is, whether the students are here or at home with remote instruction, we have to take attendance,” he said.
 “I don’t foresee a student sitting there if they have a schedule that has four or five academic classes back to back to back. I don’t think I could sit there for that amount of time, and I think our teachers recognize that it’s a bit much to expect a student to do,” he said.

The MSHSL is allowing fall teams to host practices, but it will be interesting to see how students get or stay motivated knowing there will be no games. In addition, spring sports will also be given the green light to practice in fall also. What does this all mean for coaches and ther pay? With fall sports hosting practices in fall and then a normal season in spring, will they get paid for both? Likewise for spring coaches, if they host fall practices, will they be covered for those also? I suppose pay would be up to each district, but if there is no revenue coming in, will they fork the bill? They should, but will they? After all, coaches are not just "in-season", they often set up different fundraisers, schedule open gyms, set up tournaments, speak with colleges about potential student-athletes, help student-athletes with life situations, all sorts of things in the "off-season" that many don't see. Coaches do so many things behind the scenes that go unnoticed or underappreciated. Coaches can be the most influential people in these kids' lives and these kids may need them more than ever during these times.

DAYTON — As part of its plan for a return to school Aug. 25, the Dayton School District will use three recently purchased automatic thermal scanners for student temperature checks.
 Heading into their three respective schools each day the roughly 420 students of the district — the largest in the area returning for face-to-face instruction — will make a quick stop in front of a machine before they proceed to classes.
 The devices are Personnel Management Kiosks by a company called Meridian. Dayton Superintendent Guy Strot said each one cost the district about $2,400.
 In addition to the thermal scanning, they’re also equipped with facial recognition technology, which the district won’t be using — for now.
 Although originally expected to offer the added bonus of monitoring absenteeism through a student database, the devices were met with mixed feelings in the community and expressed through social media.
 But by the time of a live demonstration Thursday to help put families’ minds at ease the district realized the software it needed to gather the data and keep student info, limited to name, photograph and temperature, out of the cloud was more complicated than initially believed.
 Strot and Dayton School District assistant to the superintendent Jana Eaton decided to hold off on the facial recognition component.
 Eaton said it will be simpler to use the devices to take temperatures and have a staff member check off names from a list as students enter.
 “We are small enough that we all know all of our kids,” Eaton said Thursday morning during student registration. “We’re using a staggered start, and each school will have one entrance. Kids will get used to the system, and we will get fast at it.”
 Strot said Thursday he hadn’t received much negative feedback about the devices and would still consider using facial recognition at a later date should the software improve and allow for a printout of the information.
 He added that the company that makes the devices is doing beta testing on software and he would rather wait until that’s complete. So, he said checking off students by hand will have to do for now.
 Parents who attended the Thursday morning session of registration did not seem to have an issue with the device. Parents and students alike stopped at the technology as they entered while staff showed them how the process worked.
 Stephen Dean, father of 9-year-old fourth-grade twins Victor and Luis, said he was a little concerned about the use of facial recognition at first until he heard the data was not going to be online.
 “When I read into it I saw it was a closed loop system and that made me feel a lot more comfortable,” Dean said. “With the way the internet is, I was concerned about having their information out there. But with a closed loop system, I think that’s great and would have made things more efficient for students coming to school and being safe.”
 Norbert Cush, father of high school junior Tristian, mostly agreed. He said he liked that the school is using a device to track students’ temperatures. He said it made him feel safer allowing his son to return to school. Like Dean, Cush said he was OK with the district’s plan to use facial recognition after hearing it would be a closed loop system.
 “In this day and age it’s inevitable, facial recognition is everywhere,” Cush said. “You’re taking pictures, you’re taking selfies. You’re constantly doing something somewhere where your picture is being taken.”
 Edward Brooks, father of high school junior Julia and first-grader Oliver, said while he has no problem with the idea of using the technology in school, he thinks people hear “facial recognition” and assume the worst.
 “I think it can be misconstrued as a form of ‘Big Brother,’” Brooks said. “There’s a certain fear factor and people tend to panic, especially right now, with everything that’s going on.”
 Strot said he wants to take every safety precaution he can so that schools can open and stay that way. Most of the area’s other schools have announced they won’t be reopening for face-to-face instruction this fall.
 Dean said he’s pleased that Dayton schools are reopening.
 “It’s great,” Dean said. “(Victor and Luis) really need the social interaction and they really need the face-to-face learning. I don’t feel like I’m the best option for them to learn from. I’m educated myself, but at the same time, I’m not a teacher.”
 Still, Dean said safety should be the priority. So far, he likes the steps the district is taking to keep everyone safe.
 “They are set up well with the thermal scanners and the masks,” Dean said. “It’s great.”
 Cush is also pleased families are being given the choice whether or not to send their students back, noting that the district is also offering distance learning for families who prefer it. He said his son actually excelled with distance learning during the spring, but wishes to return to school for now.
 Brooks is a little less sure. He said while the plan is currently to send Julia and Oliver to school, the current situation with the pandemic makes him very nervous about it.
 “All it takes is one infected person to change everything,” he said. “I’m kind of thinking as time goes on, kids, being kids, might take off the masks at the strangest times.”
 Students were less divided on the issue of returning to school.
 Twins Victor and Luis are excited to return to class.
 “I’m really excited,” Victor said. “I miss my friends.”
 “I’m excited to just learn more math,” added Luis.
 Julia said she’s ready for things to start going back to normal.
 “I’m wanting to see my friends and go to classes in person because it’s kind of hard to do that at home,” Julia said. “It was hard to stay focused at home because you get sidetracked with social media.”

The first major cruise ship to set sail in the Mediterranean was poised to depart from Genoa on Sunday, as Italy's struggling travel industry hopes to regain ground after a bruising coronavirus hiatus.
 The departure of the MSC Grandiosa from the northwestern port city at 1930 local time (1730 GMT) represents a high-stakes test for the global sector in the key Mediterranean market and beyond.
 The international cruise industry has been battered not only by the ongoing health crisis which in March forced the worldwide grounding of its ships, but accusations of a botched handling of the epidemic in its early stages.
 Cruise lines are hoping that new, tighter protocols will allow them to control the still-lingering threat of coronavirus aboard its ships while still offering travellers a cruise experience that does not disappoint.
 Arriving passengers preparing to check in before taking a required coronavirus blood test inside the terminal told AFP they were not concerned about the virus. Some said they believed cruises were now safer than other vacation options.
 "I couldn't miss the first cruise after COVID," cruise blogger Rosalba Scarrone, 64, told AFP.
 "I've taken 87 cruises, can you imagine how much I've suffered not setting off from February until now?"
 The Grandiosa is part of the fleet of privately-owned MSC Cruises, founded in Naples but now based in Geneva. The ship will travel to the ports of Civitavecchia near Rome, Naples, Palermo and Valletta, Malta during the seven- day cruise.
 Competitor Costa Cruises, owned by Carnival, has opted to delay the restart of its Mediterranean cruises until September, with departures from Trieste and Genoa for Italian-only clients. The company said the measure was designed to "guarantee the maximum security for guests, crew and local communities."
 \- Fewer passengers -
 Much is riding on the decision to restart cruises. Italy represents the bulk of Europe's cruise industry, reaping 14.5 billion euros of revenue per year ($17 billion) and supporting nearly 53,000 jobs, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA).
 The group estimated a potential economic loss from suspended cruises throughout Europe could amount to about 25.5 billion euros.
 "The voyage ... represents a tangible sign of comeback for one of the fundamental economic industries of our city," said Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci. Over 2 million cruise passengers departed from the city last year.
 Last week, Italy's government, which is striving to revive the country's moribund economy after a more than two-month lockdown, gave cruise operators the green light to begin operating again as of August 15.
 MSC authorities said approximately 2,500 passengers would be on its debut cruise, limited to about 70 percent of normal capacity.
 All eyes in the industry will be on the Grandiosa after a smaller cruise operator, Norway's Hurtigruten, was forced earlier this month to suspend its newly restarted service after dozens of passengers and crew tested positive for COVID-19.
 Global health authorities criticised the industry's slow response to the spread of the virus at the onset of the crisis earlier this year before ships were grounded in March, from lax monitoring of crew, to continued operation of self-service buffets and gyms, to lack of personal protective equipment.
 \- Buffet is served -
 As of June 11, 3,047 people were infected and 73 people died aboard 48 cruise ships affiliated with trade group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), according to Johns Hopkins University data provided by CLIA.
 Health authorities say close living and working spaces for crew, along with partially enclosed environments contributed to greater risk of infection on cruises than other venues.
 MSC has suspended the rest of its Mediterranean cruises until October save for an August 29 cruise departing from the southern Italian port of Bari.
 The company said its new security protocol exceeds national and industry standards, including daily temperatures taken and escorted trips in controlled groups for excursions.
 Food from the buffet, a highlight of the cruise experience, will be served at passengers' tables.

  “Our mattress sales doubled between Q1 and Q2,” said Ariel Kaye, the founder and CEO of Parachute, which sells one mattress called “The Mattress,” made of wool from New Zealand and pocketed steel coils that costs $1,899 for a queen size. “We have seen growth across categories. It’s been a bit of a hibernation. People have time to research.”


  And it’s not just in the higher-priced brands like Dux. At Nest Bedding, a chain of stores headquartered in California whose mattresses start at $449, Christian Alexander, the COO, said he and staff members were scared in the beginning of quarantine.


  “We didn’t know how much of a drop off there would be — analysts were saying things could get really bad — but we saw our first uptick in online traffic in the beginning of April. As the months went on, we saw online sales not only made up the difference of our closed brick and mortar stores, but far surpassed their sales, which was astonishing. We had an email uptick in initial sales inquiries, increase in phone call volume to sales line, increase in conversion rate.”


  The explanation for this unusual activity seems simple. “People are spending so much time at home and less time and money eating out or going on vacations,” said Mark Abrials, the chief marketing officer at Avocado, a company that makes a carbon-negative mattress, and a vegan one (no wool) that start at $899. “People are putting more money into the home next and other things that make them feel good.”


  Philip Krim, the CEO and founder, along with Jeff Chapin and Neil Parikh, of Casper, whose mattresses start at $595, said that “We talk about ‘cozy performance’ internally. The idea is that we’re still doing work, but we want to feel safe, secure and get a good night of sleep.” Sleep is, perhaps, the most basic act of self-care.


  “You definitely have the people who have been putting it off for a long time and this was the awakening, if you will,” said Krim, with a laugh.


  The kinds of beds that are selling fast offer insight into 2020 habits. At Saatva, there’s been a spike in adjustable mattress bases. “I think a lot of people work in bed even though they say they’re at a desk or a table,” said Ron Rudzin, the company’s CEO.

Flight operations at the Walla Walla Regional Airport still have plenty of thrust, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
 Yes, passenger flights have far fewer travelers on board — some flights have even taken off with zero passengers this year.
 The airport’s commercial passenger service provider, Alaska Airlines, recently told 1,600 employees in Washington state to get ready for layoffs this fall.
 In general, aviation has been hit hard — but general aviation hasn’t tailed off in quite the same way at the local airport.
 July saw a 70% increase in operations over last year, according to data from the Port of Walla Walla.
 The airport had 4,278 flight operations in July compared to 2,511 during the same month a year prior.
 “It’s been a few years since we cracked the 4,000 operations (per) month mark,” airport Manager Jennifer Skoglund said. “So this was a very good sign for the aviation industry and the airport.”
 In contrast, numbers in April 2020 were down 68% from 2019. The complete swap in numbers shows that people are still using the airport, but the data aren’t quite as clear into why that happened.
 One factor may be the addition of what’s known as a fixed-based operator, commonly shortened to FBO among pilots and staff. Gorge Aviation Services has been leading general aviation service at the airport for about 16 months now, and Port Commissioner Kip Kelly said its impact should not be taken lightly.
 “Before that, we didn’t actually have an FBO for over a year,” Kelly said. “Nobody really to provide those types of service to pilots. So after this length of time, the word’s out that you can get any kind of service that you need in Walla Walla ... and they do deliver good service.”
 Kelly himself is an instrument-rated pilot who just stepped onto the board of commissioners after being elected last year. He said having a company that provides fueling, charter service, car rentals, aircraft maintenance and more provides a boon to the airport’s operations.
 Even at the beginning of this year, before COVID-19 became a harsh reality, the airport was seeing above average numbers, likely thanks in part to Gorge. February saw a 136% increase in flight operations from 2019 to 2020, although February 2019 did have bad winter weather, once again showing the difficulty in determining why numbers fluctuate.
 Gorge Aviation Manager Rolf Leirvik said business has been just fine after the teetering months of March and April. Things began to take off again around June 1.
 “I think we expect it’s going to continue to go back to not only where it was, but even exceed that,” Leirvik said.
 While he had high hopes for a bounce-back in aviation, things are still a bit up in the air.
 “We, like any small biz, you’re not sure what’s gonna happen with the virus or the government the next day,” Leirvik said. “(But) as an industry, people feel safer in a private chartered aircraft than an airline.”
 Leirvik said he sees plenty of new customers hopping on charter flights. People who may normally fly first class are foregoing crowded terminals and plane cabins for personal flights, he said.
 “The charter industry is starting to see tremendous growth,” Leirvik said. “I think there’s a good chance that’s gonna grow quite significantly over time.”
 Some days, Leirvik said he’ll note more than a dozen of their rental car fleet lined up ready to pick up passengers.
 So even though he estimates business is down about 25% from last year, the market is beginning to shift as travelers find new ways to venture.
 Gorge is also adding more hangar space soon for a long waiting list of private fliers in the Walla Walla Valley, and others who are wanting to move their planes to the region, Leirvik said.
 One of the other common operators is the flight school for Walla Walla University, which operates at the airport.
 University flight instructor Matthew Toelke said the numbers at the school have climbed over the years and flight operations were slightly higher this summer over last summer.
 “The real driver in a lot of those (July) numbers is Walla Walla University,” Kelly said. “Their program is pretty darn robust right now, in terms of the number of students and the like that are flying there. ... They’ve been hammering it pretty darn hard.”
 Leivrik also said flight training at Gorge Aviation has been holding good numbers.
 New pilots are in a unique scenario. Travel may be ready to bounce back in the next couple of years, and when it does, they may not be fighting much headwind when entering the workforce.
 Pilots are required by U.S. law to retire by age 65 — it used to be 60 until a law was passed in 2007, extending it to 65. That means that some pilots who may have already been on the verge of retirement may possibly decide to retire early, or they may be furloughed into retirement, depending on the company.
 At any rate, piloting is a high turnover job market. A 2016 report from Boeing predicted that forced retirement would ground 42% of pilots by 2026. Now, that may not be as big of an issue.
 “Until the pandemic hit, the global need for airline pilots was in the multiple hundreds of thousands,” Kelly said. “There was just a grotesque shortage of commercial pilots.”
 Just two years ago, the industry had been thought to be at a critical point with air travel expected to double in coming years and pilot availability dropping by 30%, according to the FAA.
 Now, across the globe, pilots are facing layoffs as a result of decreased commercial traffic. So is it a good thing that many are still seeking piloting as a profession?
 It depends on what field you want land in.
 Kelly and Leirvik said companies like FedEx and UPS are soaring right now as online shopping shipments skyrocket.
 Locally, Life Flight announced intent to establish a base in Walla Walla, which Kelly estimated could lead to four full-time pilot jobs.
 Skoglund said there are multiple areas airports can be utilized, especially in a diverse economy like Eastern Washington’s — cargo planes, passenger planes, medical services, law enforcement operations, fighting wildfires, flight training, agriculture operations, charter flights and hobby flying.
 “Airports and the aviation industry provide a valuable economic resource to a community, state, nation, worldwide,” Skoglund said.
 Even though wine weekends, alumni reunions and parent weekends at local colleges aren’t happening, the Walla Walla Regional Airport has found perhaps inadvertently a few ways to keep buzzing.
 Although there is one downside to the increased flight traffic.
 Skoglund reported last week to Port commissioners about increased noise complaints from Valley residents.
 Kelly said such complaints are inevitable sometimes because pilots love taking off early in the morning.

GLENVILLE — Construction has started on a multimillion-dollar project that will eventually result in a full-sized roundabout at one of the busiest intersections in Glenville. The project site is located at the intersection of U.S. 33, College Street and Mineral Road, near the entrance to Glenville State College.
 Six alternatives and a no-build option were all considered initially. After a public meeting was held in October 2015, and in consideration of the comments submitted following the meeting, alternative No. 9 was selected as the preferred alternative for the project. Alternative No. 9 consists of relocating and combining the existing U.S. 33/College Street and U.S. 33/Mineral Road intersection into a single lane roundabout intersection. A 16-foot wide circulating lane and 13-foot wide truck apron will be features of the roundabout.
 The proposed project improvements include the construction of the roundabout; construction of an embankment for the realignment of Mineral Road, including a pipe culvert under the embankment to maintain local drainage; the widening of U.S. 33, including construction of a new rock cut to accommodate the widening; minor-grade adjustments to all project roadways to improve profile grades and intersection of the alignments; and construction of a retaining wall to tie into an existing wall along U.S. 33. The project is part of the Roads to Prosperity program and is expected to cost $4,790,000.

Many people are under the impression that water applied through sprinklers or drip systems is more efficient than flood systems. In other parts of the United States and the world that may be true, but since Yuma has designed its irrigation distribution system on farm ditches to maximize the use of large amounts of irrigation water for each application, the water moves quickly over the field, and when the planned amount of water is applied, the water is turned off.
 Growers do use miles and miles of portable sprinklers when they are germinating vegetable crops grown from seed and irrigating transplanted cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower to name a few. Sprinkling can lower the temperature in the field by 20 or 30 degrees, creating a microclimate that allows for the rapid germination of seed. On the transplants, besides creating a better environment for the plants, it reduces problems with various insects that attack the small plants. Sprinkling also keeps water in the very shallow root zone of the transplants so they do not have to struggle for water, and it makes available nutrients and pesticides that have been applied to the soil before transplanting. Yuma County irrigation is a highly developed process, and there is a lot going on that isn’t obvious to the casual observer.

“They’re portals, in a sense,” he said. “I consider them between painting, drawing and sculpture, and a repository of memory — the memory of the body.”


  The quilt, vernacular object par excellence, proved to be rich terrain for what Biggers calls “material storytelling.” As the full scope of his quilt work comes into view, it sheds new light on his long-held concerns — with the Black experience, American violence, Buddhism and art history — and reveals interior dimensions of his personal journey.


  Biggers made his first two quilt works in 2009, installing them at Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. One of the vintage quilts had a flower pattern; the other was plaid. On each, he transposed from a historical map the locations of the church and safe houses from the Underground Railroad, marked them like stars in a constellation and connected them with charcoal and oil stick.


  The reference was to a theory that holds that people along the Underground Railroad shared crucial information in code through quilts hanging at safe houses and other waypoints. Scholars have found little validating evidence, but for Biggers, the fact of folk knowledge, even when it’s apocryphal, has worth in itself. “It’s more important that the story endures,” he said.


  This fall, an exhibition of nearly 60 of Biggers’ quilt-based pieces, titled “Codeswitch,” will open at the Bronx Museum of the Arts before traveling in 2021 to Los Angeles — where the artist grew up — and New Orleans. A separate fall show planned at Marianne Boesky Gallery in Manhattan, titled “Soft Truths,” will present new quilt works juxtaposed with his Afro-European marbles.


  Sparked by his interest in hidden codes, Biggers’ quilts in turn reveal hidden connections amid his eclectic oeuvre. “It’s this series of works that has allowed me to read his other work well and really come to terms with what it might be up to,” said Andrea Andersson, director of the Rivers Institute in New Orleans, who curated “Codeswitch” with Antonio Sergio Bessa of the Bronx Museum.


  Biggers, who turns 50 this year, is perhaps best known for his conceptual installations mingling pathos and dark humor. In “Blossom,” first shown in 2007 at Grand Arts in Kansas City, Missouri, and later acquired by the Brooklyn Museum, an artificial tree bursts through a baby grand that he has converted to a player piano; it plays his arrangement of “Strange Fruit,” the haunting anti-lynching lament.


  “Laocoön,” involving a massive, inflatable vinyl Fat Albert character prone on the floor, seemingly struggling to breathe — based on the Iliad character, depicted in Renaissance sculpture as an icon of suffering — caused some unease when it was shown at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2015 and the next year at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit for its apparent allusions to police killings of Black men and to the cartoon’s originator, Bill Cosby.

In Washington, districts must submit a reopening plan to the state education department within two weeks of their first day of school that requires them to attest they will provide the minimum amount of instructional hours in whatever plan they pursue. Some states — like Louisiana — want more proof that districts intend to help students catch up, said Robin Lake, director of Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE).
 Lake and her colleagues are tracking these plans. They’re “across the map,” she said, partially because many districts had to trash initial plans when it became clear it wasn’t safe to offer in-person learning. The best of their plans, she said, give more predictability to parents, and provide clear expectations.
 In Northshore, whose closure set off alarm bells in March, Superintendent Michelle Reid has a reading list that points families toward the research she’s consulting in order to make decisions. When Highline still planned to partially reopen, the district created a page that directly addressed students to describe the school day.
 Renton assembled a 120-person committee — at least one person from every school, most of them classroom teachers — to make plans for the fall. Teachers helped guide the process by sharing what worked, and what flopped. The plan emphasizes giving families and students clear, concise communication about what each week’s lessons are about, and making time and space for students to and families to connect with teachers and one another.
 The challenges are more acute in districts such as Yakima School District, where 80% of students are Latino and many are the children of agricultural workers and migrants, most of them low-income. A third of students are learning English. Their chances at starting in-person were quashed this summer after months of severe viral outbreaks in the area.
 This district learned from surveys and focus groups that while parents worked in factories and other jobs during the day, older students watched over their young siblings, leaving them little time for schoolwork.
 The district is crafting a remote learning plan with those students in mind, allowing middle and high school kids flexibility to end the school day later. No classes are scheduled when the district is distributing meals, a community lifeline. Administrators recently hired eight migrant and bilingual advocates. District officials are working with the city to broadcast Wi-Fi everywhere, said the superintendent, Trevor Greene.
 But no matter how effectively districts plan, this year will be harder for parents. “This school year is going to be such a mess,” said Shaun Glaze, the parent of an incoming first grader at Seattle’s Dearborn Park International Elementary School.
 Glaze is disappointed that the district’s plans call for several hours of screen time for first graders, and that there won’t be much of an emphasis on social-emotional learning. As the Black parent of a mixed-race child, Glaze also wishes administrators would use this time to reimagine what school could be and not try to replicate the classroom online.

The outbreak in Auckland, discovered Tuesday, has prompted officials to put the nation’s largest city back into a two-week lockdown. The outbreak has now grown to 49 infections, with authorities saying they believe all the cases are all connected, giving them hope the virus isn’t spreading beyond that cluster. New Zealand had gone 102 days without community spread of the disease before the latest outbreak. Officials believe the virus was reintroduced to New Zealand from abroad but haven’t yet been able to figure out how it happened.

Yet, the Belarusian economy has been stagnant since 2012 and this heavily regulated Soviet-type economy can hardly grow much more. Most of these big state companies will need to be privatized to become efficient and competitive, but how can that be done? When communism was collapsing, privatization was very popular, because everybody wanted their share of the public wealth. After privatization had taken place, however, virtually all ministers of privatization were accused of embezzlement or worse. People generally like small private enterprises, but private ownership of big enterprises is barely not accepted. If large enterprises were sold early on in open auctions, they would be sold to wealthy crooks, the old elite, or foreigners for a song. If they were taken over by their old state enterprise managers, they tended to collapse. There seemed to be no way to get it right.

Jones, a former high school principal, said he likely never would have been an owner of a brokerage were it not for his wife, who is white and has more experience in real estate. They own Windermere Abode together.
 The nature of real estate, a relationship-based business in which relatively minor market fluctuations can spell either feast or famine for brokers, means Black people interested in entering the industry face obstacles their white counterparts do not, said Nicole Bascomb, a Black second-generation real estate agent and owner of Bascomb Real Estate Group in Seattle.
 For one, residential brokers often rely on their personal networks to find clients. That could be one reason that, according to the National Association of Realtors, Black agents typically earn roughly half as much as other brokers. Just 28% of Black families in King County own their homes, compared to 63% of white residents, shrinking the pool of potential clients for those with predominantly Black networks.

Students start with rules and regulations and “why you want to be safe.” Next, they learn about harnesses and other equipment (there are multiple class periods dedicated to boots). Then students are introduced to the ladders at the very basic level — up and down, start and stop, secure versus hands-free. All the initial climbing takes place in a controlled environment using practice ladders, the CSI outdoor challenge course, and even a ladder treadmill to build endurance.
 By the end of the program, students are able to climb a 300-foot wind turbine in under the industry standard of 10 minutes, Bowles said.
 The program isn’t just for prospective wind techs, either. Students learn skills relevant to renewable energy and a variety of other industries, including basic tools, industrial electricity, mechanical drives, electric motors and hydraulics.

Zimbabwe's government has accused the head of a Catholic bishops congress of stoking division and seeking to create a "genocide" after the group spoke out against alleged rights abuses and economic woes.
 On Friday, the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference (ZCBC) issued an unusually strong letter deploring the thwarting of anti-government protests on July 31.
 The bishops denounced the "unprecedented" crackdown on dissent and weighed in on Zimbabwe's long-standing social and economic crisis, which the government vehemently denies.
 In a statement late Saturday, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the letter had been written under the "evil minded" leadership of ZCBC president Archbishop Robert Ndlovu.
 Mutsvangwa accused Ndlovu, a member of Zimbabwe's Ndebele minority group, of "fanning the psychosis of tribal victimisation" and sowing "sins of collective guilt" among the Shona majority.
 She likened the archbishop to Athanase Seromba, a Rwandan priest who was found guilty of crimes against humanity for facilitating the killing of Tutsis during the 1994 genocide.
 "Ndlovu is inching to lead the Zimbabwe Catholic congregation into the darkest dungeons of the Rwanda-type genocide," Mutsvangwa said, adding that the letter sought to revive the "perennial vices of division".
 \- 'Incendiary hate speech' -
 President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration has come under fire over its growing crackdown on dissent, including detentions, assaults and intimidation.
 The southern African country's economy has also been on a downturn for more than a decade, with a recent surge in hyperinflation and shortages of fuel.
 But the government again on Saturday denied there was a crisis, even as official statistics showed inflation soaring to almost 840 percent.
 Mnangagwa has implemented policies "that result in a robust economy" and has kept the country "commendably stable", the government said in statement.
 At least 20 demonstrators were arrested for taking part in banned protests against alleged state corruption and economic hardship on July 31.
 All have been charged with inciting public violence and released on bail.
 Mutsvangwa's statement -- published on the front page of Zimbabwe's Sunday Mail newspaper -- sparked outrage on social media, where the hashtag #ZimbabweanLivesMatter has been trending for the past weeks.
 "So many things are just wrong and gross in that speech," tweeted Bulawayo- based journalist Zenzele Ndebele.
 "I am Zimbabwean and I am definitely not dancing to that... tribal song," said another Twitter user.
 The opposition Movement for Democratic Change Alliance (MDC-Alliance) condemned the "incendiary hate speech" and called on the government to apologise for the "unacceptable remarks".
 "The singling out of a Ndebele archbishop... is discrimination on tribal grounds," tweeted MDC-Alliance spokeswoman Fadzayi Mahere, warning against the reviving of Zimbabwe's "history of genocide".
 Some 20,000 people were killed during the 1980s, when late ex-president Robert Mugabe led a military-style crackdown on alleged militants known as Gukurahundi.
 The targets were mainly Ndebele, perceived as backing the opposition, while Mugabe was Shona.

Black media entrepreneurs Rhonesha Bing, Anastasia Williams and DéVon Christopher Johnson have compiled a list of more than 80 Black-owned outlets, several more than a century old, but a relative few focusing on business and tech.
 “Storytelling is human,” says Saleem, who also teaches at the University of Washington, where he is a doctoral candidate at the Information School. “Who gets to be storyteller? … The reading and writing of the word has material consequences in the world, both in terms of how people see themselves in these stories, and how people are able to participate in stories."
 He thinks of Dorsey alongside icons like Zora Neale Hurston, Octavia Butler and other “Black feminist futurists and storytellers” whose works have illuminated and inspired “not just Black folks … but society writ large.”
 Dziko pointed to the power of video and the success Black people have had using social media to raise awareness.
 “This is something that’s been going on for 400-plus years,” she says. “What was new was they had to sit there and actually watch it. Now you’re forced to see this man die in front of you. … And there’s a good portion of people who are internalizing it and saying, 'I’ve got to stop this cycle.' ”
 When Michael Brown was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, sparking protests that added momentum to the Black Lives Matter movement begun two years earlier after the killing of Trayvon Martin, “there weren’t a lot of visible tech leaders talking about what was going on at the time,” Dorsey recalls.

A freight train left the Chinese city of Lanzhou for the Uzbek capital of Tashkent, carrying some 230 tonnes of electrical appliances valued at $2.6mn. On the return journey, it was to bring back $1mn of Uzbek cotton. Initially, the corridor was to only involve a railway, but due to unending construction delays in Kyrgyzstan, China and Uzbekistan agreed on a rail-to-road-to-rail line. Goods departing from China reach Kyrgyzstan, where they are unloaded, before being trucked to Uzbekistan where they are once more loaded onto a train to facilitate the final journey to Tashkent.

Andrea Dovizioso won an eventful Austrian MotoGP for Ducati on Sunday just 24 hours after revealing he would leave the Italian team at the end of the season.
 Spain's Joan Mir on a Suzuki robbed Ducati of a one-two by clinching second spot from Australian Jack Miller with a single corner to spare.
 The race featured a string of crashes and narrow escapes notably for Yamaha's Franco Morbidelli and Frenchman Johann Zarco.
 In a two way tangle on lap eight at the empty Speilberg circuit Yamaha's Morbidelli and Zarco hit the deck at high speed.
 Zarco's Ducati carried on without him, cut a corner and narrowly missed the veteran Valentino Rossi, who was clearly shaken by the close shave.
 The riderless bike exploded into pieces at a safety barrier scattering debris through the air as the race was red flagged.
 Morbidelli was taken away on a stretcher but was later able to walk to an ambulance as Zarco appeared unhurt.
 The accident followed a similar spectacular spill in the earlier Moto2 race.

HICKORY — It’s back to school this Monday for Hickory Public Schools. However, not one single student will step foot inside the school buildings. That realization, alone, makes for the most unusual “Return to Learn” in HPS history.
 With safety of students and staff as a priority, the HPS Board of Education opted for the entire district to participate in remote learning through Sept. 11. Beginning on Monday, Sept. 14, the district anticipates starting the “Blended Learning” hybrid model of Plan B — with a percentage of students attending in-class instruction on certain days and alternating with other students who are learning remotely. This model allows for social distancing in the classrooms, as well as the buses.
 With Aug. 17 as the first official day of school, families have attempted to visualize what this day will look like. This year, there’s no trying out the assigned desks, turning in classroom supplies, hugging old classmates and sharing high-fives, peeking in the fish tank, tasting refreshments, or creating name tags.

  He confesses it’s taken him a long time to articulate this calling to the ministry of sacred laughter. “There are all kinds of ways to function as a rabbi. There’s congregational life, which I did for 14 years and still conducted High Holiday services for another 34 years. Organizational life. Research. Academic life. My rabbinate is making people laugh. That’s what I do.”

Since recovering from the coronavirus in March, he has been on the front lines of the pandemic alongside his colleagues at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. But his decision to marry Schaap on July 5 was not made in a fog of fatigue. Becoming her husband had been his dream since medical school.

Christina Lomeli-Anaya has joined Visit Yuma as a marketing specialist.
 Born and raised in Yuma, Lomeli-Anaya graduated from Harvest Preparatory Academy in May 2013. She received a full-tuition academic scholarship to study at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where she studied marketing with an advertising minor.
 After a car accident left her immobile for a couple of months in her junior year, she ended up transferring to mostly online classes until she could attend the Yuma extended campus.
 In May 2017, Lomeli-Anaya graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business administration with a marketing emphasis. While finishing up her degree, Lomeli-Anaya joined the Yuma Sun, first working in the Circulation Department and later moving to the Classifieds Department.
 After graduating, Lomeli-Anaya moved to Monterey, California, where her family and the family of her boyfriend were spending a lot of time working in agriculture. She found employment as the sales coordinator for the Monterey County Convention and Visitors Bureau and was soon promoted to group sales and marketing specialist, a position created for her.
 This year the opportunity with the Yuma Visitors Bureau came up. “Having had prior destination marketing experience and with Yuma being my hometown, I was fortunate enough to get the job,” Lomeli-Anaya said.
 “Being able to bring my knowledge and experience back to my hometown has already been incredibly rewarding, especially during this time when our community is trying to stay afloat amidst the pandemic,” she added.
 “I am here to help support our community and this wonderful organization that I am now a part of. I am very excited for the future to see my ideas come to fruition.”

The Oxford English Dictionary might need a word stronger than “boggled” for you, Michael. When we first opened the garage, we used to swap out a lot of VW engines. And when you pulled the engine, there were about five wires you had to detach. And you were done. Now, a typical engine compartment has 500 wires.
 Just think about the electronics on a modern engine. You’ve got electronic throttle, sensors galore, feedback systems, fuel injectors, safety systems and more. And we’re not even getting into the cabin electronics. There are a number of things that are done by printed circuit board. But there are still plenty of wires in there running from sensors to computers.
 The good news is, hardly anything goes wrong with automotive wiring anymore. Today’s connectors are all weather-tight, and they’re pretty much designed to operate under water.
 It used to be commonplace that wires would get wet, would rust or short out, or their connectors would corrode. But it’s rare these days that anyone has a problem with wiring, unless they crash the car and crimp 40 or 50 wires. And in that case, the biggest issue is finding the problem. You drive into the back of a Ben & Jerry’s truck, and six months later, you have no tail lights and your seat heaters are permanently set to “add grill marks,” and you don’t know why.

A roundabout, which is also sometimes referred to as a traffic circle, is a type of circular intersection or junction in which road traffic is permitted to flow in one direction around a central island, with priority typically being given to traffic already in the junction.
 Contrary to many people’s perceptions, roundabouts actually move traffic through an intersection more quickly, and with less congestion on approaching roads. Roundabouts promote a continuous flow of traffic, and unlike intersections with traffic signals, drivers don’t have to wait for a green light at a roundabout to get through the intersection. Traffic is not required to stop — only yield — so the intersection can handle more traffic in the same amount of time.

Jefferson said she wasn’t upset that the Realtors endorsed O’Ban. But she thinks that “had T’wina been able to have that interview, whether or not we would have endorsed her, people would have heard there’s a different approach to being pro-Realtor,” Jefferson said.
 At the time, Jefferson didn’t elevate her concerns. Instead, she co-hosted a virtual party for Nobles that raised just shy of $5,000 for the candidate from other brokers.
 Then, in mid-July, residents of the 28th District received a pro-O’Ban mailer, produced by the PAC to which the Realtors had contributed, with a black-and- white photo of Nobles so dark her face was almost entirely obscured. O’Ban was pictured in color.
 The tactic smacked of racist fearmongering to many who received the mailer. “It looked like they selected a menacing photo of Ms. Nobles, and that to me was problematic,” Jefferson said. She contacted an executive at the Realtors, criticizing the group's role.
 In response, the Realtors “unequivocally condemned” the advertisement in an email to members, saying it had no involvement in the mailer's creation. (The O’Ban campaign also denounced the mailer.) The Realtors committed to changing how it endorses candidates and donates to political groups.
 While the state won't certify final primary results until Aug. 21, Nobles and O'Ban currently appear locked in a dead heat. Both candidates will appear on the ballot in November’s general election. If elected, Nobles would be the only Black state senator.

The first major cruise ship to set sail in the Mediterranean was poised to depart from Genoa on Sunday, as Italy's struggling travel industry hopes to regain ground after a bruising coronavirus hiatus.
 The departure of the MSC Grandiosa from the northwestern port city at 1930 local time (1730 GMT) represents a high-stakes test for the global sector in the key Mediterranean market and beyond.
 The international cruise industry has been battered not only by the ongoing health crisis which in March forced the worldwide grounding of its ships, but accusations of a botched handling of the epidemic in its early stages.
 Cruise lines are hoping that new, tighter protocols will allow them to control the still-lingering threat of coronavirus aboard its ships while still offering travellers a cruise experience that does not disappoint.
 Arriving passengers preparing to check in before taking a required coronavirus blood test inside the terminal told AFP they were not concerned about the virus. Some said they believed cruises were now safer than other vacation options.
 "I couldn't miss the first cruise after COVID," cruise blogger Rosalba Scarrone, 64, told AFP.
 "I've taken 87 cruises, can you imagine how much I've suffered not setting off from February until now?"
 The Grandiosa is part of the fleet of privately-owned MSC Cruises, founded in Naples but now based in Geneva. The ship will travel to the ports of Civitavecchia near Rome, Naples, Palermo and Valletta, Malta during the seven- day cruise.
 Competitor Costa Cruises, owned by Carnival, has opted to delay the restart of its Mediterranean cruises until September, with departures from Trieste and Genoa for Italian-only clients. The company said the measure was designed to "guarantee the maximum security for guests, crew and local communities."
 \- Fewer passengers -
 Much is riding on the decision to restart cruises. Italy represents the bulk of Europe's cruise industry, reaping 14.5 billion euros of revenue per year ($17 billion) and supporting nearly 53,000 jobs, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA).
 The group estimated a potential economic loss from suspended cruises throughout Europe could amount to about 25.5 billion euros.
 "The voyage ... represents a tangible sign of comeback for one of the fundamental economic industries of our city," said Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci. Over 2 million cruise passengers departed from the city last year.
 Last week, Italy's government, which is striving to revive the country's moribund economy after a more than two-month lockdown, gave cruise operators the green light to begin operating again as of August 15.
 MSC authorities said approximately 2,500 passengers would be on its debut cruise, limited to about 70 percent of normal capacity.
 All eyes in the industry will be on the Grandiosa after a smaller cruise operator, Norway's Hurtigruten, was forced earlier this month to suspend its newly restarted service after dozens of passengers and crew tested positive for COVID-19.
 Global health authorities criticised the industry's slow response to the spread of the virus at the onset of the crisis earlier this year before ships were grounded in March, from lax monitoring of crew, to continued operation of self-service buffets and gyms, to lack of personal protective equipment.
 \- Buffet is served -
 As of June 11, 3,047 people were infected and 73 people died aboard 48 cruise ships affiliated with trade group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), according to Johns Hopkins University data provided by CLIA.
 Health authorities say close living and working spaces for crew, along with partially enclosed environments contributed to greater risk of infection on cruises than other venues.
 MSC has suspended the rest of its Mediterranean cruises until October save for an August 29 cruise departing from the southern Italian port of Bari.
 The company said its new security protocol exceeds national and industry standards, including daily temperatures taken and escorted trips in controlled groups for excursions.
 Food from the buffet, a highlight of the cruise experience, will be served at passengers' tables.

I found myself wondering at the impetus for this precautionary note on public and council behavior. Was it made in anticipation of a McCool reply to what had been said about him by Tederick on July 27, and how council had jumped on board with, as previously reported in the above-referenced story, that unfounded personal attack?

“Normally as we start getting into July and August, demand starts tapering off, but this year I’m not seeing demand lightening up in any way,” he said. “We’re still running full speed ahead trying to keep up with everything. The demand is unprecedented, levels I haven’t seen in the almost 19 years I’ve been here — just a constant demand that doesn’t seem to be letting up.”

The impetus for the new resolution request submitted by Paul Aldrich last month was the enactment of new state legislation passed by the Democratic Virginia General Assembly majority, that went into effect July 1. As previously reported, that legislation for the most part bans the carrying of firearms into state government facilities, offices, meetings, and spaces and allows municipalities to follow suit if they see fit.

Before Ashley could officially open, she had to close. Not to be deterred, she held yoga classes in the front yard of her and Ben’s Newton home. No charge. Just donations, which went to The Corner Table soup kitchen in Newton. Ashley’s plan all along has been to designate certain days as free to participants with the hope that they’ll make donations to the day’s intended charity — either money or something that the charity needs, such as canned goods or supplies.

R is not alone. Around the world there are many people who have to deal with the impediments of the pandemic, with a lot of it having to do with figuring things about, drawing a line, asking for space, and ultimately putting the relationship to test. Infidelity is not a new concept – it is an umbrella term that embodies everything from cheating to straying and adultery (for married couples). For long now, it has been used to initiate feverish debates about whether or not it is acceptable. While for some people infidelity is a deal- breaker – no questions asked – for others, it is not that big of a deal. For instance, when the host of a popular celebrity talk show asked a Bollywood A-lister her views on relationship deal-breakers, she promptly answered: “emotional infidelity”. In the same show, when another actor was asked the same question, she had simply said “infidelity”.

So, the removal of the illegal structure, to all intents and purposes, merely coincides with the unfortunate incident at the airport and should not be construed as government vendetta. Airports are on the statutory exclusive list of the Nigerian government and are thus federal assets.

Aoun said the probe is divided into three parts. The first aims to determine the circumstances surrounding the cargo, the second where it came from and who shipped it and the third to find who was responsible for handling and securing it.


  “We had the determination to reach conclusions quickly, but we found out that the issues are very complex and require time,” said Aoun.


  When asked about what measures he took when he learned of the explosives in July, Aoun said the information came to him “very late,” but his military adviser was reassured that those with direct responsibility were handling the matter.


  “They all were informed,” Aoun said, adding that he made sure those who could take measures to secure the area were in the loop.

ENTERPRISE, Ore. — Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has closed the Snake River spring Chinook fishery, while opening the fall Chinook harvest season beginning Tuesday.
 “The spring Chinook fishery essentially died a natural death,” said Kyle Bratcher, the Wallowa District Fish Biologist. “The fish aren’t there anymore and the anglers have moved on, too.”
 Fisheries biologists expect nearly 15,000 fall Chinook, including about 9,500 hatchery fish, to cross Lower Granite Dam near Lewiston, Idaho.
 About half of those fish will be bound for the Clearwater River in Idaho with the other half bound for the Snake and Salmon Rivers.
 Though the fishery will open Tuesday, fall Chinook will not likely be available to anglers until September when fish arrive in greater numbers.
 “Fall Chinook fishing in the Snake River has been one of our more consistent opportunities,” said Bratcher. “Despite seeing reduced anadromous runs across the board, we still have enough fall Chinook to offer a season to salmon anglers.”
 Snake River fall Chinook saw returns of fewer than 1,000 fish annually from 1975 to 1995.
 Since then, abundance has steadily increased with record counts of more than 50,000 fish crossing Lower Granite Dam in 2013 and 2014.
 Fisheries managers were able to begin offering fall Chinook fisheries in 2009 and have opened seasons every year since.
 Like last year, this year’s bag limit includes one wild (unclipped) Chinook per day.
 While some true wild fish will be harvested, biologists estimate about 60 percent of fish with intact adipose fins are actually unclipped hatchery fish.

Samrudhi says she was in a long-term relationship with someone who repeatedly cheated on her, both emotionally and physically. “He hid it from me for years, which brought out a lot of toxic traits in me. I was always suspicious and distrustful of him. I would constantly invade his privacy, keep tabs on him, be suspicious of the people he would hang out with; because I was always afraid he would cheat on me. At this point in life, I will certainly not be forgiving of a partner who has been unfaithful.”

However, Scott’s Place wasn’t the only local nonprofit that benefited from the help of good Samaritans. Just a few blocks away, volunteers from Trinity and City Church were doing their own projects at Rising Stars, a nonprofit organization that provides many students in the county with after-school meals and tutoring, among other things.
 In addition to installing a new roof, the volunteers are completely redoing the kitchen and bathrooms, as well as fixing water damage in the building and installing panels and a new half wall in the area where students will work.
 Sherry Kinder, the organization’s executive director, said she couldn’t believe the generosity of the volunteers and other anonymous donors who made the work possible.
 “There aren’t even really words,” Kinder said. “For each one thing that was offered in assistance, it’s ended up blossoming into more.”
 Wotring said that it was his and his church’s honor to do the volunteer work, and he hopes the projects they’ve worked on will breathe new life into the two crucial Fairmont nonprofits.
 “Being a part of this community, we feel the need to support other organizations and not be so inwardly focused,” Wotring said. “It’s about giving back to the community that gives so much to our church, and also our faith motivates us, and we believe faith in action is much more impactful in a community than just being stagnant.”
