Jesus taught us love is the greatest commandment. Now is the time for us to show the world what Christian do when they are called upon to walk the talk.

The big news on this week's Bestsellers List is the debut of Erik Larson's "The Splendid and the Vile" in the top spot on the Original Non-Fiction list. Larson's intimate portrait of Winston Churchill during his first year as British Prime Minister, beginning in May 1940, draws on diaries and archival documents, some recently released, to create a day-to-day record of England's darkest year through the life of Churchill, his family and a country besieged by months of bombing during the German Blitzkrieg. Of course, novels set during or after the Second World War have had a hold on the Original Fiction list over the past couple of years ("The Tattooist of Auschwitz" and "The Orphan Thief" are current examples). But this is the first time in recent memory that a non-fiction book about the last world war has captured the book- buying public's imagination.
