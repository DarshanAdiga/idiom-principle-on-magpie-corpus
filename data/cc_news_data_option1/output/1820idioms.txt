“They have their own protocols in place where they don’t wear the same clothes to and from the hospital. They wear scrubs in the hospital.
 “So, we have been lucky. I have been lucky so far. None of us have had any symptoms and Sarah has been in work full-time.
 “It brings its own challenges but you sort of trust that the hospitals are doing their best to limit the spread as well as people going into hospitals.”
 The virus has also challenged how Tekno Surgical, the company Fenton works for as a medical sales representative, goes about its business, with personal protective equipment now part of their output.
 “A lot of our business would be elective surgery. With COVID, they shut down operating theatres, bar emergency cases just in case any cases come in with coronavirus so yeah, that’s put on hold for the time being but from our point of view we’re adaptable as a distributor.
 “We’re trying to bring in personal protective equipment, we’re trying to bring in anything now that’ll help the hospitals.
 “A couple of our sister companies provide ventilators, so they’ve been flat out. We’re certainly not as active in the hospitals because they don’t want sales professionals going from one hospital to another.”
 As well as working from home, Fenton is kept busy with his studies, as he builds towards a masters in business management. But while his time is full, the lack of a social outlet is jarring.
 He was speaking in conjunction with Pieta’s Darkness Into Light Sunrise Appeal, which ought to have taken place this morning and, in light of the current difficulties people face, the GPA and WGPA have launched REST (Routine, Exercise, Sleep, Talk), a mental fitness campaign.
 “What comes hand in hand with football is nights out and the bit of craic and even training camps,” Fenton explains.
 “Away from football, you’re missing your social interactions. My boss would probably want me to say work but I’m happy enough working from home at the minute. It’s just that social interaction.
 “I just love bringing the dog down the park, watching sport and just walking around and being out and about. I’ve a nice, fancy barbecue out the back and I miss not having the lads over and a few games of FIFA but luckily enough I live with my girlfriend and I get to see her.
 “It rolls back to the Pieta launch. I have been in isolation, really. She gets up, she’s gone to work, I’m working and studying from home.
 “I can imagine there are so many lonely people out there looking for that social interaction and none more so than Gaelic footballers.
 “We want to be out and about and engaging with whoever we are. Just the craic about St Anne’s Park in Raheny, walking about and being out with my mates and having a couple of drinks.
 “I will look forward to all this when it is done.”
 One outlet that has provided some sustenance, however, has been the stream of old games that broadcasters have shown over the past couple of months as an alternative to the lack of live sport.
 Fenton laughs that he would be “crucified” by modern day managers for some of the hoofball tactics of yesteryear.
 “I never really got a chance before to watch them,” says the 27-year-old.
 “I watched a couple of the 70s games so you had the likes of John McCarthy, James’s dad, playing in corner-forward whereas James was wing-back.
 “You might be slagging James that his dad was a nippy corner-forward.
 “Similarly, with Dean, Barney Rock has these incredibly big hands. I assumed he was a midfielder or a centre-forward.
 “Again, there was a lot of, ‘Jesus, if I did some of those things they were doing under Jim (Gavin) or Dessie (Farrell) we would be absolutely crucified for it’.
 “Some of the defensive tactics was just if it fell to you, just to hoof it out.”
 His father, also Brian, instructed him to keep tabs on Anthony Tohill when TG4 showed the Derry-Down classic from 1994 a couple of weeks ago.
 “The text read, ‘Derry v Down is on either TG4 now. Anthony Tohill. Watch and learn.’
 “I was watching Anthony Tohill. So, I just sort of sit back and watch.
 “I watched a piece of the (Dublin-Kerry) 2013 All-Ireland semi-final on TV.
 “I was up in the Canal End on one of my first dates with my girlfriend watching it.
 “I watched that, so even comparing that game to the ones in the ‘70’s.
 “It was just absolute carnage and the scenes in Croke Park, jeez it just brought me back to being a fan again.
 “I was watching Brian Mullins in a couple of the games and how different the role of a midfielder even is now. Really enjoyed it. Really interesting.
 “I wonder will I look back at our games in 30 or 40 years saying, ‘Jesus, we were absolutely crap’ and me here thinking I am a great fella. It was just really, really interesting.”

Seven weeks after Gov. Phil Murphy ordered residents to stay home and non- essential businesses to close to fight the spread, New Jersey’s death toll from the coronavirus increased to at least 9,116 fatalities Saturday, with state officials reporting at least 137,085 total cases since the outbreak started in early March.
 Officials reported another 166 deaths attributed to COVID-19 and 1,759 new positive tests in the 9 million-resident Garden State, which has more cases and deaths than any U.S. state but New York.
 Murphy said the daily number of cases and hospitalizations keeps dropping. But he has yet to give a definitive timeline for gradually peeling back his near- lockdown orders, saying the state risks the numbers jumping again if reopening is rushed. He has called on residents to continue social distancing and wearing face masks when going out to stores or parks.
 “The number of new cases continues to show an overall positive trend, but where we are seeing the most progress is in the declining positivity rate — that is the number of tests which are coming back positive," the governor said during his daily coronavirus briefing Saturday afternoon. ”The daily positivity rate has been coming down — steadily — over the past several weeks. And, for the latest tests which we can assign a collection date to — in this case May 5 — that rate has dipped to 27 percent. So, we’re making progress."
 The total number of patients in intensive care is getting better, but not at the rate “we’d like to see,” Murphy said. “We are not out of the woods, folks."
 This is the fourth straight day there were fewer than 2,000 new positive COVID-19 tests announced, even though deaths are up.
 About half of the state’s COVID-19 deaths have come at longterm care facilities, such as nursing homes and veterans homes. And more than half of the known fatalities have had underlying conditions, according to the state’s coronavirus tracking website.
 On Friday, the state reported a 4-year-old girl with an underlying medical condition was the first child in New Jersey to die from COVID-19 complications.

Why such rigidity? The real problem was not so much a confrontation mindset as a phenomenon that the historian Paul Kennedy had identified in the late 1980s: “imperial overstretch.” Like other empires before it, the U.S. had allowed itself to become so over-extended after twenty-five years of “unipolarity” that strategists had their hands full keeping an increasingly rickety structure together. Nerves were on edge, which is why an ethnic uprising that might have been accommodated at an earlier stage of U.S. imperial development was no longer tolerable. Because the rebels had run afoul of U.S. imperial priorities, they constituted a fundamental threat and therefore had to be bulldozed out of the way.

The lights were still on and I could still see that I had over half of my battery charge on the meter, so I was a bit confused to say the least. I popped the battery off (which can be done while riding, as it's right there in front of the handlebars) and then slapped it back on. I was rewarded with false hope when I got a few more seconds of power before it cut off again. No pedal assist, no throttle, nothing.

Champagne glasses were no doubt clinking in Washington now that the Ukraine was solidly in the western camp. But then everything went awry. First, Vladimir Putin seized control of the Crimean Peninsula, site of an all-important Russian naval base at Sevastopol. Then a pro-Russian insurgency took off in Donetsk and Luhansk, two Russian-speaking provinces in the Ukraine’s far east.

ROME (AP) -- A petition signed by some conservative Catholics claiming the coronavirus is an overhyped "pretext" to deprive the faithful of Mass and impose a new world order has run into a hitch.
   
 The highest-ranking signatory, Cardinal Robert Sarah, head of the Vatican's liturgy office, claims he never signed the petition. But the archbishop who spearheaded it said Friday that Sarah was fully on board, and he has the recorded phone conversations to prove it.
   
 Thus Sarah, the Guinean-born hero to the Catholic right-wing, has landed in another he said-he said controversy, following the polemics over a book he penned with retired Pope Benedict XVI on priestly celibacy that created a huge firestorm this year.
   
 The virus petition, signed mostly by Italian clergy, academics and journalists, is the latest initiative by conservatives to frame COVID-19 lockdowns as an assault on religious liberty, a threat to the global economy and a conspiracy to separate families.
   
 The petition calls the pandemic a "pretext" by unnamed actors to manipulate and control people through panic and deprive them of their fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of worship. It warns that contact-tracing devices, required vaccinations and "criminalized" visits between grandparents and grandchildren are "a disturbing prelude to the realization of a world government beyond all control."
   
 It's another manifesto from Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the former Holy See diplomat who achieved notoriety with his 2018 j'accuse of a high-level Vatican cover-up of sex abuse. Vigano has gone on to opine -- negatively -- on everything from the Vatican's China policy to Pope Francis' outreach to Muslims and the pope's Amazon synod.
   
 Aside from Sarah and Vigano, the prominent signatories include three other conservative cardinals who have been critical of Francis' papacy, including the ousted prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, and the retired archbishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal Joseph Zen.
   
 It was issued Thursday, the same day the Italian government and the bishops conference reached an agreement to resume Masses starting May 18, with strict protocols, after a two-month shutdown.
   
 Vigano blindsided Francis' papacy with his 2018 claims of a two-decade cover- up of disgraced American ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.
   
 Francis defrocked McCarrick after a Vatican investigation found he sexually abused adult seminarians and minors. The Vatican still hasn't released its promised report into Vigano's allegations.
   
 Sarah grabbed headlines in January when he released a book with Benedict as co-author asserting the necessity of keeping Catholic priests celibate. It created a ruckus because it implied that the retired pope was trying to influence the ruling one, who was then weighing whether to allow married priests in the remote Amazon.
   
 Benedict's secretary insisted the retired pope never agreed to be a co-author and asked that his name be removed from future editions.
   
 Sarah insisted Benedict had indeed agreed and had contributed significant amounts of text. Seeking to clear his name, Sarah provided contemporaneous notes of his dealings with the retired pope.
   
 Vigano is now using that tactic against Sarah to show that the cardinal was on board with the virus petition despite his claims to the contrary.
   
 Sarah tweeted Thursday that while he might "share some questions or preoccupations" about fundamental freedoms raised by the petition, he didn't sign it, and shouldn't, given his role as a Vatican official.
   
 Vigano, though, gave a time-stamped chronology of his communications with the cardinal, including a recorded May 4 phone call in which Sarah said: "I give my consent to put my name on it because it's a fight we have to conduct together, not just for the Catholic Church but all humanity."
   
 Vigano said would forgive Sarah "for the grave crime he committed against the truth and myself."
   
 In a final salvo, Sarah tweeted later Friday that he was leaving it to the conscience of anyone who wants to exploit the matter. "I decided not to sign this text. I fully accept my choice."

Beyond the stern formalities of the Red Square military parade and smaller parades in other cities, Russians in recent years have turned out in huge numbers for the Immortal Regiment processions, when civilians crowd the streets displaying photographs of relatives who died in the war or endured it. Russian officials routinely bristle at criticism of the Red Army's actions in the war, denouncing the comments as attempts to “rewrite history.”

“The coffee ought to be dried up to moisture level of 13 per cent. And if the farmer chooses to store it for some time before disposing of it he should pack it in bags and place them on wooden pallets to avoid picking moisture from the floor,” says Ssentamu.
 The bags should be placed a good distance from the walls. The roof must be leak proof and the room must be well ventilated. When the coffee is to be transported from the farm to the market the bags must be protected from dust and rain and the farmer should use trucks that have tarpaulin covers.
 He further said that coffee must never be stored together with crops such as maize and beans in the same room because they might transmit mould to the coffee and damage its quality.   Quality   Sowedi Sserwadda, chairman of Kibinge Coffee Farmers Cooperative Society in Masaka, made nearly similar recommendations about best coffee harvesting practices.
 “Good coffee quality production begins with farmers planting the best quality plantlets,” he told Seeds of Gold. “Good quality coffee includes coming up with large coffee beans such as screen 17 and screen 18 which is only achievable if the farmer uses the right planting material obtained from nurseries licensed by UCDA.
 The coffee trees must be well taken care of from planting to maturity by the farmer doing the weeding, applying the needed inputs, and carrying out regular inspection.
 During harvesting the farmer should not trip but rather pick the coffee cherries carefully, removing only the red, ripe, ones.   Picking green coffee cherries causes loss for the farmer because they weigh much less after drying than the red ones and apart from that they kill the cup taste. Since we are into group marketing we ensure that no farmers dry their coffee on the bare ground.
 That practice causes foreign objects such as stones and animal droppings to get mixed into the coffee which degrades quality. We prefer that the farmers spread out the coffee on tarpaulin to dry under the sun as soon as they harvest it.”
 Asked how farmers can go about this since harvesting is taking place during the rainy season, Sowedi said, “That is why we are insisting on the use of tarpaulin because upon noticing that it is about to rain the farmer can fold up the tarpaulin and cover up the coffee, thus protecting it from the rain.
 When it stops raining he just uncovers the coffee and spreads it out again. In fact even if it rained on the coffee right on the tarpaulin the damage is not as bad as what would be caused by keeping harvested red coffee beans indoors for days waiting for sunshine.”
 In the Masaka region and perhaps a few other regions thieves often visit farms at night and harvest unripe coffee and eventually get buyers of the coffee. This evil practice has led some farmers to harvest unripe coffee from their own gardens before the thieves take it. When asked to comment about this problem, Sserwadda, who is also the Chairman of Kibinge Sub-county, said, “Farmers must exercise vigilance in their groups to fight this. What we do here when we see anyone spreading out unripe coffee in the yard we ask him where he got that coffee from.
 If he has a garden we ask him to show us where he picked the coffee in his garden. We then blame him for picking unripe coffee before reporting him to the authorities. If he has no coffee garden it is clear that he either stole it himself or he bought it from a thief. It becomes a police case.”
