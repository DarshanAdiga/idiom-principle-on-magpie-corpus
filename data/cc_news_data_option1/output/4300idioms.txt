I was asked by a friend this week if I didn't like Cody Bowen. I replied, "Of course I like Cody, but I firmly believe the sheriff's office is a professional place and voting for sheriff should be considered carefully."
 The sheriff is a very powerful individual and voting for one shouldn't be taken lightly. Five years of experience as a school resource officer doesn't qualify an individual to run an office that investigates the worst of crimes, makes the decision to lock up or release criminals on a daily basis, manages a million-plus-dollar budget, protects our constitutional rights and heaven forbid may be dealing with rioters like we see in Portland.
 Cody is very likable and a really good guy whom I like and I admire his rapport with kids and adults. But, I think voters need to ask if he would make the cut if he was going through a hiring process instead of a good old boys popularity contest?
 I encourage those voting for Union County sheriff to look who the professionals are endorsing. The professionals endorsing Bill Miller are individuals with the knowledge of what makes a good law enforcement manager/sheriff. These are the professionals we would ask or expect to be on the hiring board if there was a hiring process. For these reasons I will write in Bill Miller for Union County sheriff. I encourage you to join me.

ALEC is sort of almost a dating service between politicians at the state level, local elected politicians, and many of America's biggest companies. It brings them together much as a dating service would do. It sits them in rooms behind closed doors where three times a year they come together to think about what should be the next wave of state-based legislation and they have presentations from the companies that say what they would like to see done legislatively in states right across America. Then they have a vote and the legislators begin. Hundreds of state legislators across America belong to ALEC and come to these meetings.

Sherwani has stopped checking Facebook, and her family is concerned for her safety. It is particularly troubling that her traditional reservoir of support is evaporating. Many of her “own community”, journalists, now troll her, since that is an easy way of buttressing their so-called nationalist credentials and ensuring career advancement in media houses aligned with the government. Little she says about anything goes without an inimical reaction, but more adverse responses than ever come from “blue ticks”, verified Twitter accounts of her peers and other seemingly respectable people.

They talked about their actual agenda, they talked about their budget, which showed the degree of which they're in financial difficulty post the Trayvon Martin controversy. One of the things that leapt out at me was a page which was titled "Prodigal Son Project," and beneath it was a list of 41 companies — and I mean, major companies, the biggest in the country and most iconic, there's Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonalds, Walmart, Amazon, General Electric — and those are all companies that quit as members of ALEC in the two or three months after Trayvon Martin died. And by dint of that name, Prodigal Son Project, it suggests that ALEC is very keen to get them back — and you sort of can start to understand why when you see the funding structure of the network. The vast majority is something like 98 percent of its funding comes from the corporation side as well as major foundations, conservative think-tanks and funding bodies. So although they get an equal vote, the corporations, alongside the politicians, they pay the lion's share of the money.
