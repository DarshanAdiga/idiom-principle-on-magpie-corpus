Evolution Digital and Rovi Corporation have announced that they are working together to offer to Evolution's Universal Digital Transport Adapters (uDTAs) with a Rovi DTA Guide.
 Cable operators have been deploying DTAs as a way to go all digital and freeing up analog bandwidth for other channels and services without having to deploy more expensive set-top boxes. By partnering with Rovi, Evolution will be able to offer a DTA with a guide that allows users to navigate through hundreds of SD and HD channels.
 "The ability to find the TV shows you want to watch can greatly influence consumer satisfaction with their cable TV experience," said Bob Shallow, senior VP of sales and marketing at Rovi. "This fundamental functionality should not be limited to advanced devices. We're working with Evolution to add value to uDTAs in the eyes of subscribers, so that MSOs can deliver a simple device that provides advanced functionality beyond a signal converter."

We have been at the mercy of a cut off low to our west, which has been responsible for the shower and thunderstorm activity. Since these types of systems are cut off from the flow of the jet stream, they tend to meander, which is hard for computer models to pinpoint details and locations, as opposed to a typical storm set up. This is likely the reason we did not see that much activity here, as the low didn't wobble far enough east.

Voters in Cooper County will have some tough decisions to make during the June 2 elections.
   
 With a total of 10 wards throughout the county, Cooper County Clerk Sarah Herman said this election will be anything but normal due to COVID-19.
   
 This year's Municipal Election 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. June 2. Coters want to obtain an absentee ballot through June 1 at the county clerk's office, though, Herman said. The Cooper County Courthouse will be open 8 a.m. to noon May 30, as well for those seeking an absentee ballot.
   
 Herman warned voters not to be concerned about the April 7 date at the top of the ballot even though they are voting on June 2.
   
 "I did not have time to repurchase new ballots to say June 2," Herman said. "We are still able to use the April 7 ballots since the elections was postponed due to the pandemic."
   
 Turnout for the municipal election typically is low at 12-14% on a normal municipal election. Last year's elections had a 22% turnout due to a ballot question from the Boonville R-1 School District, Herman said.
   
 With the COVID-19 pandemic still effecting surrounding counties, Herman said the elections could go two ways.
   
 People will either really want to get out, which is why you would see 20%, or they will want to stay home. That is when there is maybe 10% voter turnout because they are worried, she said.
   
 There are several decisions for voters, including Proposition 1 and the Extension Proposition.
   
 Proposition 1 is asking whether Cooper County will continue a county-wide sales tax at the rate of one-half of 1%, for a period of four years, ending December 31, 2024. The tax continuance will fund county road system improvements, including new bridges and culverts.
   
 Voters also will decide if the Extension District in Cooper County can impose an annual levy up to 14 cents per $100 of assessed valuation to fund University of Missouri Extension District programs, equipment and services.
   
 A yes vote will continue educational programs in 4-H youth development, agriculture, Master Gardeners, nutrition, wellness and other Extension programs in Cooper County.
   
 Boonville residents will decide on a the continuation of a one-half of 1% capital improvement tax, along with a license tax waiver for vehicles, both for a period of five years.
   
 Voters in the Village of Windsor will have a question on the ballot to establishd a business license tax. The levy would authorize the Village of Windsor to collect $25 annually on all qualifying businesses within the village boundaries.
   
 The 10 voting wards are at Firm Foundation Four Square Church, United Methodist Church, the Knights of Columbus, Immanuel Lutheran, Blackwater Depot, Clarks Fork Mount Herman Baptist Church on Highway B, Bunceton Community Building, Otterville Senior Center, Pilot Grove Community Building and the Prairie Home Lions Club.
   
 Herman said social distancing will be maintained along with extra judges at every precinct.
   
 "Usually, I have only four because of low turnout but for this election I am going to have six," Herman said. "I am going to have two election judges waiting outside."
   
 Those judges will direct voters to follow a blue line. There also will be tape lines spaced six feet apart and voters should wait for election judges to motion to approach when they are ready for the next voter. Voters should have their ID ready for election judges.
   
 Judges in smaller precints will place a number on a voter's car so they know who is next in line.
   
 "Once it's safe for them to come in, they will be able to go inside and vote," Herman said. "My election judges are going to have masks and shields that they will be wearing along with gloves."
   
 Hand sanitizers and disinfectant sprays also will be available. The only items voters will touch are ballots and pens. Voters will keep the pen.
   
 The June election is a trial run for August and November, Herman said. This is definitely not a normal election because of COVID-19, she said.
   
 "We are learning a new way of doing things so patience is key," Herman said. "We want to make sure people are as safe as possible, not only the public, but my election judges as well. I only have so many judges and I need them for August and November."

Responding to a Columbia University disease model suggesting tens of thousands of lives could have been saved if social distancing had been implemented a week or two earlier, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that data show that "government matters" and ripped the Trump administration's leadership during the COVID-19 crisis and the weeks leading up to it. Warren, who is under consideration as Joe Biden's running mate, said the Trump administration had done a poor job of stockpiling personal protective equipment. "If the Trump administration had started planning for this crisis back in January, we wouldn't be in this mess today, and lives would have been saved and our economy would be in better shape," Warren, who lost her brother to the coronavirus, told Jon Keller of WBZ-TV on Sunday morning. "But it takes planning, and it takes a smart, thoughtful, science-informed, aggressive response. Back in January, the Trump administration was ordering masks for themselves, but not for anybody else around the country … When people were calling and saying, 'This crisis is coming. Can we help?' The answer was no. And that has been the position of the Trump administration all along. It has been to deny the problem, and not have effective leadership, and I think every time we go back and analyze where we've come from to this point, we see that what the Trump administration has done has cost people lives, and has cost our economy - a lot of, a lot of, a lot of harm to people." Trump has defended his administration's virus response and called for economic reopenings to bring back jobs. Warren declined to weigh in on whether Gov. Charlie Baker was moving too quickly to reopen the state's economy. Reopening, she said, is going to be "totally based" on COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and personal protective equipment availability. "And then every step we take, you just have to keep collecting the numbers," she said. "And we're going to, you know, going have to learn as we go along in this. But the point is to make an informed decision."

A month out from hosting the Primetime Emmys, ABC's Jimmy   Kimmel is getting a big promotion.
 Starting Jan. 8, _Jimmy Kimmel Live_ will swap time   periods with _Nightline_ , moving to 11:35 p.m. where the late-night talker   will compete head-to-head with NBC's _Tonight Show With Jay Leno_ and CBS'    _Late Show With David Letterman_.
 ABC said in the announcement Tuesday that the shift was   meant to "better position the network for increased ratings and financial   performance over the long term." _Jimmy Kimmel Live_ 's audience grew by 3%   in total viewers for the 2011-12 season, registering its most-watched season in   five years.
 "Given the passionate fan base _Jimmy Kimmel Live_   has built over the past decade and the show's ratings and creative momentum   this season, the time is right to make this move," said Ann Sweeney, co-chair,   Disney Media Networks and president, Disney/ABC Television Group. "There is the   potential for far greater upside over the long term with this shift, given   increased advertiser demand for competitive entertainment programming in the   time slot."
 The network will use _Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve   With Ryan Seacrest_ and its coverage of college football's Bowl Championship   Series, which wraps on Jan. 7 to promote the switch.
 Beginning in March, _Nightline_ will add a Friday   primetime hour at 9 p.m., again timed to leverage the promotional platform of   ABC's broadcast of the Academy Awards on Feb. 24. At that time, _What Would   You Do?_ will move to another spot on the schedule.

Michael J. Fox will return to television next fall, as NBC has given a 22 episode commitment to the actor's untitled comedy series.
 In the single-camera laugher, Fox will play a husband and father of three in New York. The series will be loosely based on the actor's life, including his battle with Parkinson's disease. It comes from Sony Pictures Television and Olive Bridge Entertainment. Will Gluck and Sam Laybourne serve as co-creators and executive producers; Gluck will direct the pilot.
 "To bring Michael J. Fox back to NBC is a supreme honor and we are thrilled that one of the great comedic television stars is coming home again," said Bob Greenblatt, chairman, NBC Entertainment. "From the moment we met with Michael to hear his unique point of view about this new show, we were completely captivated and on board. He is utterly relatable, optimistic, and in a class by himself, and I have no doubt that the character he will create -- and the vivid family characters surrounding him -- will be both instantly recognizable and hilarious. Being in business with him is a supreme pleasure."
 This marks Fox's first regular TV gig since _Spin City_.
 "I'm extremely pleased to be back at NBC with a great creative team and a great show," added Fox. "Bob Greenblatt and all the folks at the network have given me a warm welcome home, and I'm excited to get to work."

“Before I went in (the military), it didn’t mean too much,” Johnson said. “Since I went in, you just feel an attachment that you have never felt before, an attachment to the flag, to your country and to your comrades.
 “After being in 20 years, I really do feel that.”
 Johnson, a Waco native, said he always heard stories growing up from a family friend about the Air Force, which later influenced his decision on what branch of the military to join.
 “He talked to me (and said), ‘If you ever think about joining the military, you have to think about the Air Force because this is the way to go,’” Johnson said. “I was working for L.L. Sams and Sons in Waco, the church furniture company, and I saw that it wasn’t going to go anywhere with that company. So I thought that at least if I join the military, I will have some chances at moving on.”
 When he was young, Johnson said, he used to rebuild car engines and machines, so his work on aircraft was in line with what he enjoyed doing.
 While Johnson enjoyed working on aircraft and the many machines, he said his favorite part about the military was getting to travel around the world and seeing the many countries. Johnson said during his four years in Hawaii he was able to see the territory become a state on Aug. 21, 1959.
 Johnson finally left the Air Force after 20 years and 9 months at the rank of master sergeant when the military wanted to send him to Germany for three years, a move that his wife and two sons didn’t want to make.
 “(My family) didn’t want to go, and it was a three-year tour, so I didn’t want to be unaccompanied for three years,” Johnson said. “I had submitted my retirement request and it had came back disapproved because I was in a critical career field. So, I waited a few months and submitted it again, and they approved it that time, so I got out in June of 1976.”
 After leaving the military, Johnson worked for Texas Instruments in Abilene, writing programs and maintaining some equipment, before later moving to Temple.
 Now a member of Temple’s Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 1820, Johnson said the organization has given him a place to feel a part of and to share his stories with those who understand.

According to sources, FCC chairman Julius Genachowski has   circulated an order allowing cable operators to encrypt basic tiers and it is   said to incorporate some accommodations for IP-enabled devices -- like Boxee --   offered up by cable operators to help secure passage of the item.
 The commission signaled last fall it wanted to remove the   ban, which cable operators had asked it to do/ Sources suggest the commissioner, Democratic and Republican are generally on board with the order, though a vote is not expected until at least next week.
 â€ŒIn a July 25   letter to the FCC, in response to complaints by Boxee and others about the   inability of such devices to access programing on basic tiers once they are   encrypted, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association said that it thought   the concerns were misplaced, but that its six largest members would make a   three-year commitment to ensuring those devices could receive a signal through   one of two options, both pertaining to retail boxes.
 According to a source familiar with the order, the FCC did not include a three-year sunset, but instead agreed with the Consumer Electronics Association that it should not be time-limited given that it is a nascent market. The Media Bureau will review the market in two years, though.
 Cable ops said they would provide either an adapter with   home-networking capability to decrypt TV signals and pass them through to IP   devices or an encryption solution that would be made commercially available to   third-party manufacturers.
 According to an FCC source, the commission has incorporated   the cable proposals into its proposed order, though details were not available.   The source said cable ops have already started asking for meetings next week, which means cable ops may not have gotten everything they   wanted out of the order, like that absence of a 3-year sunset.
 While cable ops had offered both hardware and hardware-free   solutions -- it would be the operator's choice and depend on the system -- Boxee   and other consumer device manufacturers were looking for a hardware-free,   long-term solution for third-party devices.
 Boxee also said that if the FCC accepted the cable ops'   proposal, it should make compliance an enforceable prior condition of basic   tier encryption, and should ensure that specs for operator-supplied hardware or   technology under either choice be available to third parties, as well as define   a home networking standard that would be available to all on a   nondiscriminatory basis.
 In June, Boxee   and Comcast came to an agreement on an adapter that would let users of   Boxee-based set-tops access encrypted cable programming.
 In October 2011, the FCC in proposed allowing cable   operators to encrypt their digital tiers. But as the world is going digital,   with a push from the FCC, the commission proposed scrapping the ban.
 The FCC adopted the rule prohibiting cable operators from   scrambling digital basic tiers so that viewers with cable-ready sets would not   have to buy or rent a set-top box. Now, because of the cost savings to cable   operators, the reduction in pollution from fewer truck rolls, theft-of-service   prevention, and the general lack of complaints in markets where the agency had   granted waivers -- most prominently to Cablevision Systems in New York in 2010 --   it was time to lift the ban.

May 18th marks an important day in the history of Eelam Tamils. The Sri Lankan state’s genocide on the Tamils reached its height in May of 2009. The failure of international bodies and institutions to prevent genocide of the Tamil people resulted in one of the most recent genocides of the 21st century. In May 2009 alone, tens of thousands of Tamil civilians lost their lives and countless others maimed and injured. The slaughter of Tamils reached genocidal proportions in Mullivaikal, where tens of thousands of Tamils were slaughtered in cold blood. Civil society in the Tamil homeland estimates that over 146,679 people disappeared during this time. Today, those civilians continue to remain unaccounted for and the pursuit of justice for them continues.

As Joe Biden panders shamelessly on his vice presidential candidate selection, Americans would be wise to observe the grim goings-on in Michigan. The "vote your body parts" chickens are coming home to roost with a vengeance. An entire state is being held hostage to the emotion-driven diktats of two politicians who used "vagina, voice and vote" and "I don't have a penis" to achieve power. Gretchen Whitmer and Dana Nessel are self-righteous, smug and condescending. And they feel absolutely unaccountable to the very people they are meant to serve.

CHINA CENSORS EU OP-ED: The European Union delegation to China says Beijing allowed a Chinese state newspaper to publish an op-ed from the delegation only after a reference to the Chinese origins and spread of the coronavirus was removed. “The EU Delegation to China made known its objections to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in no uncertain terms,” the delegation said in a statement Friday. However, it said it decided to proceed with publication to convey key messages on climate change and sustainability, human rights, the importance of multilateralism and debt relief for highly indebted countries. Only the English-language China Daily published the editorial.

After a report of a man violating a relative's order of protection at Good Samaritan Society, police determined no order existed, but the man was told he was banned from the facility, and would be charged with trespassing if he returned. A letter he had brought his relative was deemed non-threatening -- it just said he was headed to another city. In reports last week, the same man reportedly twice harrassed West Gate staff for not allowing a worker to come to his home.

That said, make sure to do your due diligence and investigate any and all alternative internet options. That even includes crappy DSL; I don’t love it, but it’ll still be faster and cost less than using your phone as a hotspot on any plan you pick from your wireless carrier. Satellite internet should be considered the internet of last resort. If you have no other alternatives whatsoever, it’ll work, but the experience will be much worse than basically anything else.
