One of those members that needs no worry about where he will be, Bryce Harper, belted a two-run shot during the scrimmage. Harper has been hitting the ball well during the extended Spring Training period this July.
 The red and pinstripe squads ended their scrimmage in a 5-5 tie. The Phillies open the season with a weekend series against the Marlins beginning Friday.
