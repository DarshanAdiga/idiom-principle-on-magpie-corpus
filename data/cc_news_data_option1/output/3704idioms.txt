"The private cloud ecosystem continues to mature in light of rapid digital transformations, making the competition to land one of the coveted spots on the Cloud 100 list steeper than ever," said Byron Deeter, a top cloud investor, and partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. "Private cloud valuations are getting bigger as the market's appetite for cloud continues to grow. Over the past five years, the average Cloud 100 valuation has grown by a tremendous 2.5x, from $1 billion in 2016 to $2.7 billion in 2020. In fact, our 2020 Cloud 100 includes over 87 private cloud unicorns! These founders represent the absolute best in cloud computing today, and they will most certainly follow in the footsteps of our esteemed Cloud 100 alumni. More than a third of the companies of the Cloud 100 have exited either via strategic M&A, financial M&A or Initial Public Offering. Congratulations to these cloud leaders!"

Several Republican operatives were subsequently revealed to be aiding efforts to get West on the ballot, including Lane Ruhland, an election lawyer who has worked for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin; Rachel George, a Republican consultant in Colorado; and Atlas' Gregg Keller, the former executive director of the American Conservative Union.
 Third-party candidacies, of course, can influence the outcome of an election. While a Morning Consult/Politico survey last month of 1,983 registered voters nationwide found that West had the support of only 2% of them, presidential elections in some states have been decided by less. In 2016, Trump and Hillary Clinton were separated by fewer than 23,000 votes in Wisconsin, where the Libertarian Party candidate, Gary Johnson, won close to 107,000 votes.
 “Winning the presidency can come down to a razor-thin margin in a single or handful of states,” Steffen Weiss, managing director of research science for Morning Consult, said in an email. “Any independent candidate on the ballot in a battleground state, Mr. West included, could be consequential in an otherwise close race.”
 West first called a Times reporter for this article Aug. 11, close to midnight on the East Coast but a couple of hours earlier in Cody, Wyoming, where he lives. He had just tweeted, “I’m willing to do a live interview with the New York Time about my meeting with Jared,” referring to a recent meeting he had with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, that The Times had inquired about.

“The American public needed urgently to know what was being done routinely in their name, and there was no other way for them to learn it than by unauthorized disclosure,” he said in his written testimony.
 “I observe the closest of similarities to the position I faced, where the exposure of illegality and criminal acts institutionally and by individuals was intended to be crushed by the administration carrying out those illegalities,” he added.
 U.S. prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Assange on 17 espionage charges, and one of computer misuse, over WikiLeaks' publication of secret U.S. military documents a decade ago, largely around the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq a decade ago. The dump, similarly coordinated at various stages with some of the world’s leading newspapers, was arguably the biggest single leak since the Pentagon Papers four decades before. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.
 Like Assange, Ellsberg faced the prospect of decades, at least, in prison.
 After leaking over 7,000 pages of classified documents to the press, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ellsberg was put on trial on 12 charges in connection with violations of the Espionage Act. They were punishable by up to 115 years in prison, but the charges were dismissed in 1973 because of government misconduct against him.
 Ellsberg, who had worked at both the State Department and the Pentagon, said Assange won’t be able to provide a justification for his actions if he were to be extradited to the U.S. in the same way that he was denied the chance to raise a public interest defense for his leaking of the Pentagon Papers.
 He said that Assange “cannot get a fair trial for what he has done under these charges in the United States.”
 Pressed repeatedly by James Lewis, a lawyer acting on behalf of the U.S. government, about the consequences of the leaking of unredacted documents, Ellsberg said there was “zero evidence” that the actions of Assange and WikiLeaks had led to anyone being harmed. He also said that Assange took great care not to willfully expose anyone to harm.

Because a variety of allies and supporters of President Donald Trump are working on the ground to advance his campaign, many Democrats view his candidacy as a dirty trick by Republicans, a notion that West has rejected. Still, in a year in which the president is working to undermine confidence in the election, West’s candidacy is one more point of uncertainty. And many Republicans, including Trump, appear confident he will siphon votes from Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, although his appeal could be blunted by some of his conservative positions.
 West has a bare-bones platform, focusing on general objectives like reforming the police, reducing household and student loan debt, and “restoring prayer in the classroom,” with each point reinforced by a bit of scripture. In discussions, the topic he brought up most was his opposition to abortion. He does not, however, want to ban abortion.
 “You can’t do that,” he said in a phone call. “I don’t want to ban or stop or point fingers at anything.” Instead, he said he supported “stipends for families that need support, creating orphanages that are really high-level desirable for people to go to, and the redesign of communities and cities in general to be supporting of families.”
 He didn’t elaborate on his views on other issues when asked, saying at one point that he had an album to finish.
 A number of consulting firms are aiding his candidacy. Mercury Public Affairs, a prominent bipartisan New York political consulting firm, played an organizing role, although the firm was dismissed last month and was reluctant to discuss the matter.
 “Our role was limited to helping the campaign get started up, primarily by helping to recruit a ballot access team and launch that effort,” said Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury. “For a short time, we served as a liaison between the campaign and the team until they established independent relationships. That happened weeks ago, ending our involvement.”
 McKeon would not say why Mercury was not included in the companies that received disbursements in the West campaign’s recent filing to the Federal Election Commission, which showed that West had lent the campaign nearly $7 million.
 The filing showed that West had also brought on both a Republican-oriented firm, the Atlas Strategy Group, and a Democratic-leaning one, Millennial Strategies, to help get him on the ballot. Millennial, however, bailed out after less than a month on the job, shortly after his South Carolina appearance, during which he said that Harriet Tubman “never actually freed the slaves” and that “she just had the slaves go work for other white people.”

While they haven't yet met in person, Savannah was able to speak to that man on Wednesday through the help of the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office and the Commonwealth Journal. Although he doesn't wish to be identified, and noted that at least four or five others had come up to the vehicles to help, the Good Samaritan turned out to be a pastor who had been traveling Ky. 80 for work that afternoon and was able to pray for and with Penny before she passed away.
 Following behind the other vehicle, the pastor said he was able to avoid the collision and came to a stop near Penny's vehicle.
 "I've been there in the last moments with people and every situation's different," he said, "but I'd never been involved in as tragic a situation as this, with a vehicular accident where everything's so sudden.…
 "What I remember most is there was just a very calm peace during that whole time frame," he continued, adding he was able to stay with Penny for 20-30 minutes.
 The pastor called his conversation with Savannah special. "That was left open, when I left Penny, not knowing who all was going to be affected.…For Savannah to reach out to me and fill in some of those blanks really brought closure for me also."
 He went on to express his appreciation for the first responders on scene, saying he didn't do anything but stay and help hold Penny until they got there. "The work that they do and the things they have to see…I've got a new appreciation for them," he said.
 Savannah echoed those sentiments as well as passing on her family's sympathies to the family of the couple in the other vehicle. Of her mother, Savannah wants her to be remembered as a good person who loved her family and made it past the troubles she'd had in her life.
 "She was a clown," Savannah said of Penny. "She was always making jokes. She always was trying to make people laugh. She had the biggest heart I've ever seen in anyone. If she had $5, she would somehow give you $10.…She was just a really good person."

En crisis económica, con más de dos años de recesión y en plena pandemia del covid-19, Argentina reforzó aún más su muy estricto control de cambios para tratar de frenar una caída de reservas que la coloca al límite de la disponibilidad de divisas.
 El gobierno del presidente de centro-izquierda Alberto Fernández decidió mantener un cupo de 200 dólares mensuales para particulares, pero a un impuesto de 30% que ya tenían esas operaciones sumó otro de 35%.
 "Los dólares hacen falta para producir, no para guardar", justificó este miércoles el presidente Alberto Fernández.
 Con el nuevo esquema, el tipo de cambio oficial, que este miércoles cerró en 79,55 pesos por dólar, se paga en realidad a 131 pesos por dólar, la misma paridad que tenía la semana pasada el informal o blue, que a su vez se disparó a 145 pesos.
 "Se buscó no aplicar una restricción cuantitativa a los 200 dólares por mes. Lo que se ha hecho es buscar un efecto a través del precio con la aplicación de esa retención", explicó el presidente del Banco Central, Miguel Pesce.
 \- "Tradición de dolarización" -
 El Banco Central enfrenta "compras muy fuertes de dólar ahorro (de particulares). Hicimos un esfuerzo importante para alinear las tasas de interés. (Pero) hay una tradición de dolarización que va a llevar mucho tiempo revertir", indicó el funcionario.
 Según cifras oficiales, solo en agosto el Banco Central vendió unos 1.280 millones de dólares.
 El nuevo esquema cambiario se adoptó ante la persistente caída de reservas internacionales que ni siquiera una exitosa reestructuración de unos 100.000 millones de dólares en deuda tanto local como extranjera, completada hace dos semanas, ha conseguido detener.
 Las reservas de Argentina se ubican en unos 42.450 millones de dólares, una pérdida de casi 10.000 millones de dólares en el último año. Pero los analistas estiman que las reservas líquidas son mucho menores.
 El endurecimiento del control de cambios "es el resultado de la caída de las reservas internacionales" que ha colocado las reservas líquidas en unos 5.000 millones de dólares, consideró el economista Renzo Merino, de la calificadora de riesgo Moody's, en una conferencia online.
 "Esto es una muestra de que el gobierno se encuentra bajo presión, pero no ha encarado el problema de por qué los argentinos no confían en su moneda", añadió Merino.
 \- Riesgo inflacionario -
 Para Merino, la principal preocupación radica en que el encarecimiento de la divisa lleve a una disparada inflacionaria, en uno de los países con mayor índice de precios al consumidor.
 "Cada vez que hay crisis económica en Argentina, la población se vuelca a comprar dólares, y cuando sube el tipo de cambio aumentan los precios, incluso los de los bienes no transables, con la idea de que se producirá un shock inflacionario, y en efecto ese comportamiento lo provoca", dijo Merino.
 La inflación de Argentina fue de 53% en 2019 y ha logrado, en medio de la pandemia del covid-19, desacelerar un poco, a 18,9% entre enero y agosto de este año.
 Pero las restricciones para la compra de dólares "tienen un efecto inflacionario en el corto plazo sin que haya manera de aumentar las reservas", dijo a la AFP el economista Héctor Rubini, de la Universidad del Salvador.
 Argentina entró en recesión en 2018 y se estima que su economía sufrirá aún más este año por efecto de la pandemia del coronavirus. El Fondo Monetario Internacional calcula en 9,9% la contracción del Producto Interno Bruto para 2020.
 El gobierno estimó un crecimiento de 5,5% del PIB en su proyecto de presupuesto para 2021, con un déficit fiscal de 4,5% del PIB, una inflación de 29% y un tipo de cambio de 102,4 pesos por dólar.
 Además del nuevo impuesto a la adquisición de divisas de particulares, el Banco Central dispuso que aquellas empresas con deudas superiores a un millón de dólares deberán reestructurar 60% de esas acreencias.
 "Eso perjudica a la mediana empresa exportadora, que necesita importar insumos y es a la que se debe apuntar para la reactivación económica de la próxima década", estimó Rubini.
 "Si no se quiere un salto del tipo de cambio hay que cesar la emisión monetaria. Pero eso no es gratis: habrá mayor recesión", indicó el economista.

WEBSTER - Its roster at a bare minimum, the Fire Department, which has no one in the station during early-morning hours, received a significant staffing boost from the federal government Wednesday.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Webster will receive a three-year, $1,320,465 award from its fiscal 2019 Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response grant program.
 Webster was one of 91 departments nationwide to win a share of the $253.1 million in SAFER grants.
 "It's history-making," Fire Chief Brian Hickey said in an interview. "We just changed the whole face of the Fire Department. We've gone from a part-time department, per se, to a full combination department that's going to have 24-hour coverage seven days a week.
 "As excited as I am about winning the grant," he continued, "the townspeople are the ones who are going to win because, from midnight until 7 a.m., there's nobody in the station. So our response times are going to be cut dramatically."
 The lack of personnel has resulted in response times as long as 15 minutes in the early-morning hours, he said.
 While the department is staffed from 7 a.m. to midnight seven days a week, it is at a "bare bones" level, the chief said. It employs three people per shift, though the minimum standards call for four, he said.
 "With this grant, we'll be able to move from that to 24-hour coverage with four people around the clock," he said. "That's going to be a mix of full-time people and part-time people working to get the job done."
 The department presently employs three full-time firefighters and a roster of 34 part-time firefighters. The part-time staff covers the station from 3 p.m. to midnight on a rotation of three people working three-hour shifts, Hickey said.
 The department responds to an average of 700 to 800 emergency calls a year, including 40 to 45 building fires of varying degrees, the chief said.
 "The town is just too busy, too big, there's too much going on, to be running with three full-time people, and trying to manage it with part-timers," Hickey said.
 Hickey said the additional hires would help bring the department "from the dark ages into the modern world" in terms of coverage. The money will cover pay and benefits for seven new firefighters.
 The town has applied for the grant the past six years. This time, Hickey said, Town Administrator Douglas C. Willardson allowed him to hire a grant writer who specializes in seeking this type of funding.
 The town will have to figure out a way to sustain the salaries after the grant expires in three years. The town can reapply, but there's no guarantee it will secure another round of funding, Hickey said.
 The grant should also help the department with its ongoing training requirements, Hickey said.
 "People don't understand how much training we have to do constantly," Hickey said, adding that many of Fire Department workers "do things on their own time just to make things better."
 Under another FEMA grant program for fire departments, Worcester received $117,183 for a Cooking Fire Education and Prevention Campaign in collaboration with the Worcester Housing Authority. The grant, announced Friday, is a share of $6.8 million in fire prevention and safety funds distributed to 30 fire departments nationwide.

In the 1960s, when Crouch came of age, he was part of the emerging Black Arts movement, championed by poet and activist Amiri Baraka. It was a sometimes militant effort to create art, music and political strength within the African American community, separate from the dominant White culture.
 Crouch joined a Los Angeles theatrical group led by Jayne Cortez, a major figure in the Black Arts movement, and wrote defiant poetry and plays. By the early 1970s, he was growing disaffected with the Black nationalist movement.
 "Race pride is something that I'm not unacquainted with," he told Newsday in 1990. "But that's different from racism, and a lot of people in the cultural nationalist movement are hard-core anti-white racists. And to me, racism is antithetical to the Afro-American tradition."

Through good times and bad, Savannah Hubbuch said she had always tried to maintain contact with her mother.
 On that last afternoon, according to Savannah, Penny had been on her way to pick up her boyfriend. When he couldn't reach her by phone for about 30 minutes, he became concerned and ended up driving along the route he believed Penny would have taken and found traffic backed up due to the accident.
 "She had told him she wasn't feeling good and wasn't able to drive," Savannah said. "She couldn't find anyone to drive for her, so she had to go by herself."
 Savannah said her mom's boyfriend was able to find out from a first responder that there were two fatalities and that a black Chevy Suburban — the kind of vehicle Penny was driving — had been involved but could not get any confirmation beyond that about Penny herself.
 The family ultimately learned what happened to Penny when authorities made contact with her father, Savannah's grandfather. Savannah began posting on social media about her mother, with one of the posts being seen by someone who had been at the accident. The woman shared a picture of a man leaning into Penny's window and told Savannah that he had stayed with her mother until she passed away. She asked for permission to share the picture so that her family might find the man.
 "We just wanted to thank him for being there with her," Savannah said. "At first, we thought she died on impact from the looks of the car. It brings peace to us knowing that she wasn't alone. I'd like to give him a hug, take him out to dinner or do something for him. It would just mean the world to us to let him know how much we appreciate him. He didn't have to that; he's not required to do that. It just shows that there are Good Samaritans still out there in the world."

Justin Silvera came off the fire lines in Northern California after a grueling 36 straight days battling wildfires and evacuating residents ahead of the flames. Before that, he and his crew had worked for 20 days, followed by a three-day break.
 Silvera, a 43-year-old battalion chief with Cal Fire, California's state firefighting agency, said he's lost track of the blazes he's fought this year. He and his crew have sometimes been on duty for 64 hours at a stretch, their only rest coming in 20-minute catnaps.
 "I've been at this 23 years, and by far this is the worst I've seen," Silvera said before bunking down at a motel for 24 hours. After working in Santa Cruz County, his next assignment was to head north to attack wildfires near the Oregon border.
 His exhaustion reflects the situation up and down the West Coast fire lines: This year's blazes have taxed the human, mechanical and financial resources of the nation's wildfire-fighting forces to an extraordinary degree. And half of the fire season is yet to come. Heat, drought and a strategic decision to attack the flames early combined with the coronavirus to put a historically heavy burden on fire teams.
 "There's never enough resources," said Silvera, one of nearly 17,000 firefighters in California. "Typically with Cal Fire we're able to attack -- air tankers, choppers, dozers. We're good at doing that. But these conditions in the field, the drought, the wind, this stuff is just taking off. We can't contain one before another erupts."
 Washington State Forester George Geissler says there are hundreds of unfulfilled requests for help throughout the West. Agencies are constantly seeking firefighters, aircraft, engines and support personnel.
 Fire crews have been summoned from at least nine states and other countries, including Canada and Israel. Hundreds of agreements for agencies to offer mutual assistance have been maxed out at the federal, state and local levels, he said.
 "We know that there's really nothing left in the bucket," Geissler said. "Our sister agencies to the south in California and Oregon are really struggling."
 Demand for firefighting resources has been high since mid-August, when fire officials bumped the national preparedness level to critical, meaning at least 80% of crews were already committed to fighting fires, and there were few personnel and little equipment to spare.
 Because of the extreme fire behavior, "you can't say for sure having more resources would make a difference," said Carrie Bilbao, a spokesperson for the National Interagency Fire Center. Officials at the U.S. government operation in Boise, Idaho, help decide which fires get priority nationwide when equipment and firefighters run scarce.
 Andy Stahl, a forester who runs Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, an advocacy group in Oregon, said it would have been impossible to stop some of the most destructive blazes, a task he compared to "dropping a bucket of water on an atomic bomb."
 But Stahl contends the damage could have been less if government agencies were not so keen to put out every blaze. By stamping out smaller fires and those that ignite during wetter months, Stahl said officials have allowed fuel to build up, setting the stage for bigger fires during times of drought and hot, windy weather.
 That's been exacerbated this year by the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted U.S. Forest Service Chief Vickie Christiansen to issue a directive in June to fight all fires aggressively, reversing a decades-long trend of allowing some to burn. The idea was to minimize large concentrations of firefighters by extinguishing blazes quickly.
 Fighting the flames from the air was key to the strategy, with 35 air tankers and 200 helicopters being used, Forest Service spokesperson Kaari Carpenter said.
 Yet by Aug. 30, following the deaths of some firefighters, including four aviators, and several close calls, fire officials in Boise warned that long- term fatigue was setting in. They called for a "tactical pause," so fire commanders could reinforce safe practices.
 Tim Ingalsbee, a member of the advocacy group Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology, said the June directive from Christiansen returned the forest service to a mindset prevalent for much of the last century that focused on putting out fires as quickly as possible. He said allowing more fires to burn when they are not threatening life or property would free up firefighters for the most dangerous blazes.
 With no end in sight to the pandemic, Ingalsbee worried the focus on aggressively attacking every fire could prove lasting.
 "More crews, more air tankers, more engines and dozers still can't overcome this powerful force of nature," he said. "The crews are beat up and fatigued and spread thin, and we're barely halfway through the traditional fire season."
 Cal Fire's roughly 8,000 personnel have been fighting blazes from the Oregon border to the Mexico border, repeatedly bouncing from blaze to blaze, said Tim Edwards, president of the union for Cal Fire, the nation's second largest firefighting agency.
 "We're battle-hardened, but it seems year after year, it gets tougher, and at some point in time we won't be able to cope. We'll reach a breaking point," said Edwards, a 25-year veteran.
 The immediate dangers of the fires are compounded by worries about COVID-19 in camp and at home.
 Firefighters "see all this destruction and the fatigue, and then they're getting those calls from home, where their families are dealing with school and child care because of COVID. It's stressing them out, and we have to keep their heads in the game," he said.
 The pandemic also has limited the state's use of inmate fire crews -- either because of early inmate releases to prevent outbreaks in prisons or because many are under quarantine in those prisons, both Berland and Geissler said.
 Aside from the human toll, the conflagrations in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and now California and the Pacific Northwest have cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
 California alone has spent $529 million since July 1 on wildfires, said Daniel Berlant, assistant deputy director of Cal Fire. By comparison, the state spent $691 million the entire fiscal year that ended June 30. The U.S. government will reimburse most state costs for the biggest disasters.
 Back in the field, Silvera and his crew saved two people at the beginning of their 26-day duty tour. The two hikers encountered the crew after the firefighters themselves were briefly trapped while trying to save the headquarters building at Big Basin Redwoods State Park.
 "We got in a bad spot, and there were a few hours there we didn't know if we'd make it," Silvera said. "Those people found us, and we wouldn't have been in there."
 "That's what you sign up for."

Bush and filmmaking partner Christopher Renz say they used 1970s horror films as inspiration. They hope to unsettle audiences when depicting terrors of the pre-abolition South. The Oscar-winning 1939 film “Gone With the Wind” became a touchstone. Bush describes it as both a “horror film” and “a piece of really effective propaganda.”
