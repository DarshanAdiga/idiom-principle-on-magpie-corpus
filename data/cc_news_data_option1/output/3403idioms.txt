Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park and Museum in Hamilton, Ohio, is all that and more. It is a park filled with art and can be seen in a variety of ways. It is a safe-distancing outdoor adventure suitable for the entire family.      The best way to see the unique 300-plus-acre sculpture park is by golf cart, or "art cart," as those at the park refer to it.      Many opportunities await visitors to park their cart and take a hike. With miles of hiking trails, lakes, meadows and forests, there is a lot to explore. It is a place to take a picnic, let the kids run and give them a little art education as well. Among the rolling hills and in the museum, visitors will find ancient Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Syrian and Egyptian sculptures that date back to 1550 B.C., as well as many modern art pieces.      The park was a vision of local attorney and philanthropist Harry Wilks, who in 1987 purchased 40 acres in the foothills to build his home. He continued to acquire more land as time went on and began clearing it, building roads, lakes and hiking trails. Because of his desire to preserve the land for future generations, he created a non-profit sculpture park accessible to the public.      In 2007 the Ancient Sculpture Museum opened, and it holds models of ancient Roman homes and Wilks' collection of ancient sculptures.      While cruising the grounds visitors will find gardens and more than 80 outdoor sculptures. The pioneer house that dates back to the 1820s has an arched ceiling, which was very unusual at the time.      Pets are welcome, as long as they are on a leash. Watch out for the wild turkeys and other wildlife often visible in the park.      The Pyramid House on the property was Wilks' home. It is an underground home designed by Wilks and architect Luke Schelly. It is a one-of-a-kind home and today is used for private parties and meetings. The home has been featured in Better Homes & Gardens, Architectural Digest and other magazines and newspapers. The patios offer great views of the park.      The sculptures can be enjoyed by cart, on foot or by car. Visitors can take as much time at the sculptures as they wish. Pack a picnic, bring a snack, or stop by one of Hamilton's restaurants and pick up some food to go.      During the holiday season, the park hosts the Holiday Lights on the Hill drive-through light display.      Check pyramidhill.org for current information on hours and programs. Pyramid Hill, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati, is open 365 days a year as weather permits.      Contact CR Rae at crraetravel@gmail.com.

It's been 30 years since Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves charmed audiences as the goofy, time-traveling metal heads Bill S. Preston, Esq., and Ted "Theodore" Logan in "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" and "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey." In the third installment, "Bill & Ted Face the Music," Reeves and Winter revisit their quintessential burnout bestie characters in a film that offers up an easy dose of nostalgia.
 In "Excellent Adventure," Bill and Ted had to pass history to avoid military school, which they did by assembling historic figures using a time-traveling phone booth. In "Bogus Journey," Bill and Ted escape from hell to win the Battle of the Bands as the Wyld Stallyns. Many, many years later, they're still holding onto those rock 'n' roll dreams. In "Face the Music," written by original writers Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, and directed by Dean Parisot, Bill and Ted face their midlife crisis.
 The codependent bros haven't grown up much over the years, which has hampered their lives with their wives, medieval princesses Joanna (Jayma Mays) and Elizabeth (Erinn Hayes), evident in a disastrous couples therapy session. They're the proud fathers of the music-obsessed Billie (Brigette Lundy-Paine) and Thea (Samara Weaving), but they're far more dude than dad. But soon, time travel calls, in the form of Kelly (Kristen Schaal), the daughter of their former futuristic leader Rufus (George Carlin), who tasks them with performing a song that will unite reality and prevent the timeline from collapsing in on itself. With only a few hours, Bill and Ted harness their time-travel prowess to snatch the song from their future selves, and their journey through time will help them learn to unite their own realities with their families.
 "Face the Music" has all the gravitas one might expect from a "Bill & Ted" movie, which is to say, almost none. It's fun to watch Winter (now a prolific director) and Reeves (now John Wick) step back into these roles, though the cognitive dissonance between sweet doofus Ted and the Reeves we have come to know as a serious, laconic action star is a long leap.
 Weaving and Lundy-Paine prove to be the breakouts of "Face the Music," nailing the mannerisms of their fathers. Their chunk of the story, traveling through time to scoop up the best musicians to back the Wyld Stallyns, could (or should) have been the whole movie. Another standout is Anthony Carrigan (who plays NoHo Hank on HBO's "Barry") as a deadly yet neurotic robot, chasing Bill and Ted through time as they track down their various future selves in search of their reality-uniting song. His white cue-ball head is a nod to William Sadler's incredible turn as Death in "Bogus Journey," and Sadler reprises his role here, as well as Hal Landon Jr. as Chief Logan and Amy Stoch as omnipresent stepmother Missy.
 Although one shouldn't expect realism, what rings false is the casting of Hayes and Mays as the duo's wives. They're over a decade younger than Reeves and Winter, as well as two different sets of actresses than who played the princesses in the prior films, and the age difference makes it feel like time travel but in the worst, most Hollywood way.
 Bill and Ted bouncing through time means the narratives of these films are merely loose assortments of kooky bits and cameos, and "Face the Music" doesn't stray from that. While it doesn't quite gel cohesively, in this casual kickback with a pair of old pals, it's the dudes who remain excellent.

THE Second Republic under President Mnangagwa has, in the two years of its span, recorded a number of milestones across sectors towards the achievement of Vision 2030 to transform the economy and improve lives of Zimbabweans while repositioning the country in the community of nations.      President Mnangagwa was given the mandate to rule the country when he and his Zanu-PF party romped to victory in the 2018 elections and set out to, through various interventions, take Zimbabwe back to her glory days.      Under President Mnangagwa's leadership, Government re-introduced the Zimbabwean dollar after 10 years of dollarisation while implementing bold fiscal and monetary reforms to that saw the country registering, for the first time in many years, surplus budget in the year 2019.      Owing to these reforms, Zimbabwe has been ranked 3rd in Africa on budget transparency, according to the Open Budget Survey.      The Government has also embarked on a number of infrastructural development projects white providing social safety nets for citizens affected by Covid-19 and successive droughts recorded in the country.      In a statement to mark the second year since the coming of the Second Republic, President Mnangagwa said despite economic challenges, his Government was committed to improving people's livelihoods.      "Two years ago, today, I was inaugurated as your President. I vowed to serve Zimbabwe and its people so that we could move towards a more prosperous future. Zimbabwe is not without its challenges. But rest assured that myself and this Government are fully committed to improving our great nation for the benefit of all Zimbabweans," said President Mnangagwa.      He said the US$4,2 billion Great Dyke Platinum and the US$4 billion Karo Resources Mhondoro-Ngezi platinum projects are some of the initiatives that his administration was implementing to transform the economy.      Government has committed itself to compensate former commercial white farmers to the tune of US$3,5 billion for improvements made on farms, ending years of contestations.      President Mnangagwa said Government was undertaking various infrastructure construction projects that include the Makuti-Chirundu and Karoi-Binga roads while some such as the Chiredzi-Tanganda Road were completed.      Government is also working on the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport expansion project while dams such as Gwayi-Shangani, Causeway and Marovanyati are under construction.      The President said the introduction of the Zimbabwe dollar after a decade of dollarisation has addressed the over reliance on imports.      To improve on agriculture output, President Mnangagwa said Government continues to provide vulnerable farmers with subsidised farming inputs while training at least 1,8 million farmers countrywide to optimise grain production ahead of the summer cropping season.      Government also introduced an $18 billion stimulus package, to ensure that the economy recovers from effects of Covid-19.      Government is also implementing the new curriculum to promote inclusive education, as pregnant pupils will no longer be expelled from school.      Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Professor Paul Mavima said in the face of devastating natural disasters, Government has managed to provide safety nets to cushion them from hardships.      He said successive droughts in the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 have increased citizens vulnerability of citizens who were being assisted by Government and development partners.      "All vulnerable individuals, be it the elderly, disabled or child headed families on a monthly basis they get some assistance. Last year as Government only we were providing assistance to more than 3,6 million people and this year we are going to provide food aid to almost four million people. As Government we have organised with international partners for instance World Food Programme and last year we were supporting about seven million and this year we are looking at about eight million," he said.      Prof Mavima said Government is targeting to increase fees payment for vulnerable children under the Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM) from 400 000 to one million children.      He said under BEAM, Government this year for the first-time paid examination fees for vulnerable children and would be buying their stationery and uniforms going forward.      "We also offer bills assistance for Zimbabweans who fail to pay for their health bills. In some cases, we have even given money to people who have been treated abroad but who could not pay for themselves. When Covid-19 hit, we made a target to reach one million people through cash transfers and we have registered 200 000 but we are rushing to reach the targeted figure," he said.      Prof Mavima said Government is also reaching out to people with disabilities where it is capacitating them on entrepreneurship skills and has already trained 20 000 and is targeting to increase the number.      In terms of child protection, Government is providing shelter and other basic services for children and adults living on the streets. In Bulawayo, 31 boys are being kept at Jairos Jiri Training Centre and there are other centres countrywide.

EDITOR,
 I want to say thank you to Mayor Rickman for the exceptional job he is doing leading Tracy through these difficult times. He has kept us informed and safe with the latest information concerning COVID-19. He has fought for our small businesses while other politicians have ignored their suffering. It was great to see him take the initiative and close 10th Street so our restaurants could expand outdoor dining into the street. I have spoken to many residents and restaurant owners and they are truly excited and grateful. You can tell Mayor Rickman’s heart and soul is in this city and he understands that we need to do everything possible to protect our small-business owners and help them thrive. Furthermore, during the Aug. 18 council meeting, he fought to complete Legacy Fields for our children. Legacy Fields has provided our children with much- needed soccer fields, baseball fields, softball fields and enjoyment. Unfortunately, Council Members Ransom, Young, and Arriola voted against finishing Legacy Fields. This is a huge disappointment for our children and city. We should finish what we have started before we move on to other projects. Again, thank you, Mayor Rickman, for the great job you are doing.

Bloomberg) -- Oil edged lower -- but was still headed for a fourth weekly gain -- after Hurricane Laura swept through Louisiana and Texas without appearing to inflict major damage on the region’s energy infrastructure.
 Futures in New York dipped below $43 a barrel after closing down 0.8% on Thursday. Laura came ashore as one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever hit Louisiana but has since weakened to a tropical storm. While it knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people and impacted plants that produce chemicals and liquefied natural gas, southeast Texas ports and crude facilities -- including the largest U.S. refinery -- likely avoided the worst of it.
 More than 80% of oil output in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and almost 3 million barrels a day of refining capacity had been shut ahead of the storm, causing a spike in gasoline and oil prices earlier in the week. Crude was also buoyed this week by data showing a fifth straight weekly decline in American stockpiles.
 With the passing of Laura, investor attention will now turn back to the coronavirus and the pace of the global energy demand recovery. About half of India’s trucking fleet is still idled, leading to a bleak outlook for diesel consumption there, while gasoline and diesel sales in the U.K. are still about 11% below pre-lockdown levels.
 Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Beaumont refinery in Texas will begin restarting after Laura on Friday if an assessment shows no damage, while its Baytown refinery on the Houston Ship Channel has begun the restart process. Magellan Midstream Partners LP’s East Houston terminal restored full operations at its refined products truck loading rack and the U.S. Coast Guard reopened the Port of Houston on Thursday.
 In physical markets, Gulf Coast crudes are showing mixed signals. Mars Blend, a high-sulfur crude, dropped on Thursday to its narrowest premium against Nymex WTI futures since July, while Heavy and Light Louisiana Sweet crudes rose. Bookings for tankers to ship gasoline from Europe to the U.S., meanwhile, have surged this week.

Only a few things had seen a lockdown boom—baking at home, surfing the web and watching TV among them. But in July, TV viewership actually fell, according to data of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). This was attributed to a shortage of fresh content after shoots got frozen. In August, though, couch potatoes were back on their couches, it seems: viewership was back up. Industry experts believe this growth was on the back of original programming, as production houses resumed churning out television fare.

Some players were asked earlier this week if they were concerned that the messaging — “Black Lives Matter” being painted on the courts, many players and coaches kneeling en masse for the national anthems, phrases urging social change and awareness on the back of most uniforms, all of them being steps unprecedented in NBA history — was getting stale, if there was a concern that fans were tuning it out.

BOLTON - A plan to progress toward the 10 percent affordable housing goal with a new Housing Production Plan won selectmen's support as it goes through the process.
 Making some progress, the board accepted an agreement that makes two units at the Keyes Farm development affordable and adds them to the housing inventory.
 But progress is slow at that rate. Currently, 69 of the town's 1,729 households live in homes that are considered affordable, not quite making it to the 4 percent mark, according to a committee working on the plan.
 The proposal raised the possibility the town could make a greater leap towards the goal, and gain so-called "safe harbor" and the ability to limit 40B (state afforable housing statute) projects.
 The 40B process allows developers to bypass many local regulations.
 A recent Still River Commons plan was rejected by the Zoning Board of Appeals. After the developer appealed that decision to the state, the project was reduced, but had more units than would otherwise be allowed on the parcel.
 If the town allowed a "friendly 40B" that included apartments, it could make greater progress, since all apartments in a project could be counted, even if only 25 percent were affordable under the state guidelines.
 Selectmen also discussed another 40B proposal that would require multiple waivers and building in wetlands area, illustrating the issue.
 The housing plan was outlined by Brian Boyle and Mark O'Hagan, members of the Housing Production Plan Committee, formed in 2019 to update a plan last approved by the state in 2004.
 "It sounds like a good plan," Selectmen Chairman Bob Czekanski said. "It's ambitious."
 But he said education would be a big part of the plan.
 "It's a big shift in viewpoint," he said, but "it's a worthwhile effort."
 "Hopefully we can get people on board with the concept," O'Hagan said.
 The town had taken the approach of a lot of smaller 40Bs spread out.
 "It doesn't really get you anywhere close to the 10 percent," O'Hagan said.
 The advantage of rental is counting all units, and he noted some area towns had used that approach, with Berlin looking at reaching the 10 percent threshold that way. Berlin's apartment complex was developed in cooperation with the town; a major affordable housing apartment complex in Lancaster was not and the Zoning Board of Appeals approval has been appealed by residents.
 "It makes perfect sense," Selectman Stan Wysocki said, noting there was a proposal years ago that would have done that.
 He said such an approach could bring in tax revenue without large influx of expenses since there would be fewer new students in rental property
 "And you get your zoning back," Wysocki said of the control the town would gain over development.
 O'Hagan said being open to the idea could allow the town to work with a quality developer by offering the incentive for such a project.
 O'Hagan estimated a site of 15 to 20 acres might be able to support the infrastructure needed and provide space for up to 220 units.
 He said there are perhaps a half dozen parcels in town that may be suitable, including some near the interchange of routes 117 and 495.
 A powerpoint presentation of the plan will be posted on the town website.

 • Selectmen approved reducing the Economic Development Committee from nine to seven members. The EDC had requested the change after earlier reducing the board from 11 to nine members, making it easier for members to meet with a quorum.
 • Town Administrator Don Lowe said mast arms were in for the traffic signals at the intersection of Main Street and Wattaquadock Hill Road. The plan is to have the lights flashing for about 10 days to get people used to the fact that they are there,
 • He updated the board on the truck exclusion the town was seeking for Wattaquadock Hill Road. Although Clinton's Traffic Committee had approved a plan to try the exclusion, the Clinton Board of Selectmen rejected the idea.
 "The next conversation is with MassDOT to get their thoughts on it," Lowe said.
 Watching large trucks turning at the intersection, "It's a very dangerous situation," Lowe said. "I hope MassDOT will see their way through to support exclusion.
 "I'm not giving up till we exhaust every avenue."
 • Lowe said the town is in a drought situation and was asking people to take voluntary measures, using recommendations the Water Use Committee had a couple years ago.
 Seeking to raise awareness, he said the compliance for those on wells is voluntary, but the town can encourage and educate people.
 • Selectmen discussed goals for Lowe, including LED light conversion, an electric car charging station, managing the capital planning process, working with the Advisory Committee on the budget process, creating and managing any necessary modifications to current processes relative to COVID-19 pandemic, pursuing the feasibility of installation of a solar array on town-owned land, and continuing to support the Master Plan Committee. Selectmen also suggested a three-year capital plan.
 • Lowe said the Parks coordinator has resigned and the town is advertising for the position. He said it is a position that needs to be filled; ads will run another couple weeks and the interviews will be held.
 • The selectmen accepted the gift of a hand-forged gate for West Cemetery from Jennifer Petrila and Robert and Alice Roemmer.

After the murder, Yaser seemingly vanished into thin air. Despite numerous sightings across the USA, the authorities could not apprehend him. Reports suggest that he was in contact with at least two of his brothers, and despite Patricia's protestations, she seems to have been in touch with him too. Finally, in August 2020, the capital murder suspect has been taken into custody in Justin, Texas, the Denton County town, which is 36 miles northwest of Dallas.
