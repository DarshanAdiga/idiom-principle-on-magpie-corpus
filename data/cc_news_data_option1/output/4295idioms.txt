 # Daniel spreads the ball around, clinches region title
 Ryan Davenport
 Special to the Independent Mail
 View Comments
 CENTRAL — Winning 27 games in a three year span is an accomplishment in itself. Adding consecutive region titles to that mark begins to solidify your place in history.
 The Daniel Lions picked up that second region title Friday night with a resounding 52-14 win over the visiting BHP Bears, locking up the top spot in Region 1-AAAA with two weeks to play in the regular season.
 “It’s just a culture here and we keep building it every day,” said senior Linebacker Jacob Hendricks, a fourth year starter for a team that won two games his freshman year.
 The Lions energy and enthusiasm seemingly never wanes. Special teams players are as excited on the sixth kickoff as they were at the opening salvo. The Lions sideline is a contagious atmosphere where no player goes unnoticed and as many guys as possible get significant playing time.
 “It's a brotherhood here,” said senior linebacker Blake Simpson. “At the end of the day, it’s all love and we all have each other’s back anytime, anywhere.”
 Exemplary of that environment was the Lions last possession, when senior quarterback Wise Segars repeatedly yelled to the sideline to call a play that would get a freshman tailback into the end zone. A senior quarterback who played sparingly on this night and could have had the glory of calling his own number in a region championship game.
 “The last two years have brought us so close,” said senior Jackson Crosby. “It’s easy now to introduce new guys to it.”
 The star of the Lions trio of rotating quarterbacks on this night was junior Trent Pearman. Pearman only played the first half but completed 15 of 17 passes for 289 yards and five touchdown passes. Four of those touchdowns were for 45 yards or more.
 The unselfish culture allows that system to flourish. Crosby started the game at quarterback but slid over to receiver for the remainder of the half, catching five of Pearman’s passes for 59 yards. Crosby rotated back under center later and opened the Lions second half scoring with a 23 yard run and a dive to the pylon. Segars played some tailback before moving to the quarterback position and throwing a touchdown pass of his own.
 “Pearman’s on fire right now,” said Crosby.
 “Those three guys have continued to earn the right to get on the field in practice and we’re going to continue to get them in there,” said Daniel coach Jeff Fruster.
 “Wins are hard to come by and you cherish every one of them. To be two time region champs is a blessing. I cherish my time here with these kids and this staff, so it’s a very special night for me.”

When Dennis Ketterman began to travel from Montana to Lake Havasu City six years ago, he noticed there was a need for a group for people who wish to meet others and gather for outdoor recreation.
 “This town is full of people who want to get out and do stuff physically,” Ketterman said. “Biking and paddling are two activities that you could have fun and get in shape.”
 Six years ago, Ketterman founded the Bike and Paddle Club, which approximately has 2,000 members nationally and 250 from Havasu, he said.
 He added that 20 people usually meet up for the club’s activities, which include a bike ride on Saturdays and paddling on Sundays.
 It’s that time of year where the club starts to engage in these activities. They met for a meet-and-greet mixer at the Turtle Grille at the Nautical Beachfront Resort on Thursday, which has been one of Ketterman’s favorite spots since he started to stay seasonally in Havasu.
 It was the first time they met this year, and their activities begin this weekend, including a bike ride at Grand Island Park today and paddling at Rotary Community Park on Sunday.
 Ketterman said there are no fees and anybody is welcome to join.
 “We’re just saying come on out and enjoy yourselves. No age limit,” Ketterman said. “Just have some fun, go out and have a few beers afterwards or lunch.”
 Ketterman said the club also has members who travel to Havasu during the winter, including those who come from Canada. He doesn’t think the club’s Canadian members will make the trip this year due to travel restrictions during the covid-19 pandemic. The club also has members from Sedona, Park City, Utah, and Whitefish, Montana, where Ketterman is from.
 Members usually range from 55 to 60 years old. Ketterman didn’t give his age away, but he said he’s the oldest of the group.
 Ketterman is semi-retired and manages sports-related websites, including bikeandpaddle.com, the club's official site. Prior to his semi-retirement, Ketterman worked as a promoter and marketer for sports-related magazines.
 The club’s events are listed on the website, and those who are interested can sign up for the club and subscribe to their weekly newsletter.
 The second oldest person in the club, AJ Camou, helps coordinate the paddle activities and usually does so with more than one group on Sundays.
 “I always toss it out where they feel like going because I always paddle with more than one group,” Camou said. “So maybe this group wants to go over here, this group wants to go over there, to wherever they feel like going.”
 Camou, who is originally from Southern California, moved to Havasu approximately 15 years ago, and paddling has been one his favorite activities during that same time frame. Camou currently manages properties that he owns.
 What he enjoys most about the club is meeting new people every year.
 “Good people interaction,” Camou said. “It’s good to talk to fresh faces and new people. So you’re not with the same bunch of people all the time.”

The idea of wormhole theory and time travel and everything else that went into this movie was just odd to the extent that it required a great deal of thought as well as patience as the movie continued to unfold, and people just weren't having it at that time. Some might think that a tragedy is the best time to relax and kick back, but something on the scale of 9/11 wasn't going to be remedied by a night out at the movies. In fact a lot of people had to be told by word of mouth about this movie since it didn't really get around that easily. The advertising for it wasn't even that extensive considering that some folks didn't even learn about it until the 2000s were over and done with. Yes, that's a true statement, not just an anecdote, but it is hard to prove so it will have to exist as a compromise and remain as an opinion based on fact. Donnie Darko didn't start out being the most popular movie of the decade back in its day and while it's still not the most popular movie ever it's gained a following that's nothing less than impressive since 19 years after it was released it's become one of the many movies that get discussed fairly regularly since it was an oddball flick that allows for a lot of healthy and even disturbing discussion since there were many aspects of the movie that a good number of people didn't fully understand.

Over the past two years, Kenyans who invested their money in the Amana Capital's money market fund have not been able to make any withdrawals. In fact, it is now safe to say that these Kenyans have lost over Sh200 million they had saved with the fund.   Beatrice Kanyeki is one of these Kenyans. Between 2014 and mid-2018, she invested Sh1.2 million in the fund. "I was told I would earn more interest and be able to access my money whenever I needed it," she says. She started saving through Amana. During three different occasions, Beatrice was able to withdraw up to Sh400,000 on short notice. It would take three days for her withdrawal applications to be processed and the money to reflect in her bank account.   But in January 2019, Beatrice was shocked when she couldn't withdraw from Amana. "I wanted to pay for my kids' school fees and lease land," she says. Beatrice was told that Amana had frozen all withdrawals.   One month later, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) placed a 28-day freeze on the withdrawal of funds from Amana. Since then, there has been no hope that Beatrice and other Kenyans who invested in Amana will recover their money. "I wish I had stuck to saving through the bank," she says.   Money market funds are one of the most revered ways of saving cash. They are secure, easy to withdraw from, and they guarantee returns. How could things go so wrong? The fall of Amana is joined at the hip with the collapse of former retail giant Nakumatt where it invested Sh275 million when the hypermarket was on its way down.   According to Robert Ochieng', a financial advisor at Abojani Investments, investors like Beatrice have lost their money because the fund manager they selected invested heavily in a risky investment asset class. "Amana took too much risk," says Ochieng'.

We pay our entrance fees then hop on a speedboat at the floating jetty, and it takes us to our huge Arabic style dhow operated by Pilli Pippa. The dhow was unable to dock at the jetty because of the low tide, hence the speedboat. Dubbed Almasi, this traditional dhow has a canvas cover which offers much- welcome respite from the harsh sun as we sail to Kisite Marine National Park. It is also very spacious, can accommodate big groups.   The crew hands out mandazi, home-baked pizza bread, tea and soft drinks. How my friends are able to drink tea in this heat is beyond me.   “Is that a dolphin in the water?” someone animatedly shouts.   I dash to the edge of the boat to find a good viewing spot. Rising from the gentle waves, I see the unmistakable splash of dorsal fins. A big pod of about seven dolphins frolic and dance, riding with us for a while before disappearing into the distance, and returning to put on a show. It is exhilarating to watch, as the impressed ‘ooh”s and “aah”s every time they appear can attest.   Scuba divers jump into the water fully geared up. A little further into Kisite Mpunguti Marine Park, we come to the reef. Here the water is crystal clear and a gorgeous shade of green. There are about three other boats in the vicinity. Those who can’t swim are suited up with life jackets and they follow the instructor into the water, huddled around a big floater. An avid swimmer, I pop on my snorkeling mask and dive feet first into the water then follow behind this group. This has got to be the most scenic snorkeling reef on the coast.

Unfortunately, and to compound matters, what started easily as a very non- partisan, non-religious and non-ethnic movement is being deliberately turned upside down. It would take some wisdom for the organisers to bring this progressive movement back on track. My candid opinion is that their initial strategy has achieved its first aim. Their message has resonated globally and most Nigerians at home and abroad have bought into their ideas and ideals. They must not be discouraged. The time has come for them to restrategise. Since there is nothing more to hide at this stage, they should unite and pick their own leaders and form a formidable organisation. A crusade and campaign without structures will eventually give rise to anarchy, especially if it is infiltrated by nihilists and subversives, who are up to no good, as has been the case this week. The aim at this stage should not be political. It should be how to reactivate and eventually actualise their demands. They are craftsmen and women who have created a sustainable and resilient platform. They now need to find a way of reaching out to the angry youths, the bitter destroyers, who have been going on rampage and committing acts of gross brigandage. These destructive elements have been neglected for far too long and no one should be too surprised that they are now extremely angry and giving vent to their pent-up frustrations. Our leaders and all the elites are culpable, and we must collectively accept the blames. When the wealthiest of the world live side by side with the poorest, and the rich pay no attention to the sorrow, pain and anguish of their neighbours, anything and everything can happen. The dark tomorrow has arrived on Nigerian shores, despite the good well-intentioned, nationalistic and patriotic actions of the craftsmen and women who originated the #EndSARS protests. By whatever means, next must come the magnificent, triumphant dawn.

 # Beast Feast showcases exotic food for a cause
 Cindy Peterson
 For the Daily Commercial
 The annual Beast Feast fundraiser for the Leesburg Center for the Arts showcased some exotic meats on Friday at their new location, Gator Harley Davidson in Leesburg.
 Some of the tasty options included smoked gator, iguana tacos, wild boar meatballs, kangaroo baked ziti, python and rabbit gumbo and wild turkey pot pie shooters.
 The menu was created by Gourmet Today owner Jessy Flinn, and volunteers helped prepare the meats for people to enjoy.
 “Here at Gourmet Today, we make custom menus every day for clients,” Flinn said. "So, when my friend Maria Stefanovic with the Leesburg Center for the Arts called and asked us to partner with them for Beast Feast, we were so excited to do so.
 "We have supported them in years past by being a sponsor for certain menu items, but this year we expanded quite a bit in light of COVID to provide additional safety for the guests," Flinn said. "I am thrilled to be a part of this event. Every team member at Gourmet Today plays a vital part in creating an exciting menu. It’s always a fun adventure, and this year, we plan to take it over the top to raise as much as money as possible for our Leesburg Center for the Arts.”
 The money raised will benefit the Center for the Arts children’s programs and the mobile art studio.
 “We are so excited to be partnering with Gator Harley Davidson as our host,” Stefanovic said. “This is such a great event every year and this year was no different. We are able to connect with thousands of kids through these programs. We want to keep art accessible to everyone and that is what the cause goes to support.”
 The rain managed to stay away as people quickly filled the tables, sampling all of the exotic creations.
 “The boar meatballs were by far my favorite,” Dan Patch said. “The frog legs and the iguana tacos were exceptional too. Everything was just great and far exceeded my expectations. I can definitely write a few foods off my bucket list now.”

 # Greer overcomes doubt, hardship to win region championship
 Geoff Preston
 Greenville News
 View Comments
 GREER — As he walked off Dooley Field Friday night, Greer High School football coach Will Young had a smile on his face that stretched from ear-to-ear.
 In a year that has brought so many challenges for Greer and the entire country, no one could blame him for taking a moment to feel joy. Plus, his Yellow Jackets had earned the right to smile that night.
 Greer topped Laurens, 37-21, Friday win the Region 2-AAAA co-championship and take the top seed coming out of the region because of tiebreakers.
 In a year when the entire country has been impacted by COVID-19, Greer also lost a coaching and community legend when Travis Perry died of bile duct cancer in May.
 "It’s been a tough year for everyone, for the whole world, 2020 has been rough," Young said. "It’s been unusual but what I told the guys before the game is something that's never changed is Greer football and we’re going to play it the way it should be played."
 The Yellow Jackets also lost their first game of the season to Region 2-AAAA rival Greenville, 34-17. In a season shortened by the pandemic, one loss made the prospects of making a smaller than normal playoff field very difficult.
 It would have been hard only a month ago to imagine Greer celebrating a playoff berth and region championship, but that's exactly what the Yellow Jackets did.
 Greer had to be perfect in Region 2-AAAA after the loss to Greenville, and that started with a 35-21 win over Greenwood, a 48-0 win over Eastside and Friday's win over the Raiders.
 The Yellow Jackets also needed math to be on their side to make the postseason. Three teams (Greer, Greenwood and Greenville) finished with 3-1 records, and the tiebreaker went to the combined defensive points allowed against impacted teams.
 Greer gave up 56 points against the other two impacted teams compared to 62 by Greenwood and 67 by Greenville.
 Greenwood will be the No. 2 seed from Region 2-AAAA.
 "We talked to our kids since the Greenville game about what we have to do to get the playoff berth, and I think they wanted it bad enough," Young said. "They went to practice and tried to get better, and I think we’ve gotten better with each week."
 One player who seemed to get better week-by-week has been quarterback Hollis Crosby. Crosby was first thrust into the starting quarterback role last season because of injuries to other Greer signal-callers.
 Friday he was 13-of-20 for 160 yards and a touchdown, which was a 17-yard strike to tight end Jaleel Skinner that sealed the deal for Greer.
 He also completed multiple sideline throws to wide receiver Miller Dearmond, who finished with seven catches, 110 yards and a touchdown.
 Young said he's seen progression in his junior quarterback.
 "We didn’t have a lot of miscues and mis-alignments tonight, which is a departure to what we did last Friday night (in a 48-0 win over Eastside)," he said. "We didn’t start the game off sloppy and played well for four quarters."
 Last year Greer went 4-8 and lost in the second round of the Class AAAA playoffs to eventual state champion Wren. It was not what the team expected after winning the Class AAAA upper state championship the year before.
 Crosby remembers the trip the Yellow Jackets made to Columbia well. He was only a freshman, but said the journey to Williams-Brice Stadium was one of the most exciting rides of his life.
 After a season that fell short of expectations, and a crushing first game loss, he said the team knew it would have to be perfect to get to enjoy the thrill of a playoff run again.
 "We had a bad season last year and we wanted to show that we’re one of the best teams in the state," he said. "I think you could ask anyone in that room and no one wants to go home without making a run again."
 Crosby isn't the only player adjusting to a new position. Last year, starting running back E.J. Bradford was a defensive back.
 The transition has seemed easy, as he rushed the ball 22 times for 196 yards and two touchdowns Friday night. Against Eastside, he carried the ball 20 times for 144 yards and two touchdowns.
 "You get hit way more but it’s fun to be in on the action on every play," Bradford said on the difference between running back and defensive back while smiling. "It’s fun to help my teammates out, have my teammates help me out."
 Friday night the Greer band honored Perry and his family with a performance to celebrate him at halftime.
 He graduated from Greer in 1992, and won two state championships as a coach for the Yellow Jackets, once in 1994 as an assistant and again in 2003 as the head coach.
 He also served as a role model in the community, serving as athletic director at Greer from 2008 through 2020.
 This season his loss has been felt heavy on the sidelines. A patch with a solid block 'G' adorns the back of the Yellow Jackets' helmets with one of Perry's favorite quotes: "It's all about the G," to honor their coach.
 It hasn't been easy, but Crosby being able to win a region title that seemed so unlikely after Week 1 is a good way to honor a man that meant so much to the Greer community.
 "It’s a big difference without him here," he said. "It meant a lot to us and our community that we were able to get this done."
 Bradford said this region championship is for Perry, but also for those who had written off the Yellow Jackets after their first loss to Greer.
 "It feels great to do this for coach Perry, and going from losing our first game to now and people doubting us," he said. "It just feels great to be able to overcome all that doubt."
 Greer faces Boiling Springs in a non-region game Friday.

Worldwide, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has estimated that the Covid-19 pandemic to send global FDI plunging by about 40 percent – driving the total value of FDI below US$1 trillion for the first time since 2005.      However, in spite of a sluggish start in the first quarter of 2020 and a worrying slump in the beginning of the second quarter due to severe lockdown measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, FDI to Ghana have begun to rebound resulting in a notable increase in FDI inflow for the first half of the year.      At the GIPC, a total of 69 projects with a total estimated value of US$688.74 million was recorded by the end of June 2020. Of this, the total FDI component amounted to US$627.52 million while local components accounted for an estimated US$61.22 million. The FDI value of US$627.52 million was a considerable increase of about 409.10 percent from last year’s FDI value of US$123.26 million recorded within the same period (Jan-Jun 2019), depicting a strong performance irrespective of the global pandemic.      Out of the 69 projects recorded, the services sector registered a majority of 25 projects followed by the manufacturing and export trade sector with 21 and 11 projects respectively.      With regards to value, general trading recorded the highest amount of US$246.05 million. This was tailed closely by the mining exploration sector with US$231.02 million having sealed some major investments such as the Chirano Gold mine project for the exploration of minerals. The manufacturing sector also saw significant investments valued at US$170.67 million on the back of some notable ventures such as a deal by Matrix industries for the manufacture of paper and aluminum products as well as the Rainbow Paints Limited project which is a joint venture between Ghana and Kenya for the manufacturing of paints and related products.      Geographically, the spread of the project cuts across 6 regions namely, Greater Accra, Central, Eastern, Ashanti and Volta regions with most projects registered in the Greater Accra enclave.

Geographically, the market for chiropractic medicine can be segmented into five regions, North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East & Africa. North America has the highest market share in the global chiropractic medicine owing to the easy access to services and favorable reimbursement scenario. There are over 70,000 licensed chiropractors working in the United States today. This is followed by the European market due to the existence of many healthcare facilities providing chiropractic medicine services. Asia Pacific is expected to represent a stable growth rate during the forecast period supported by the increasing investment in healthcare facilities and rise in the healthcare spending. Latin America followed by MEA represents a slow growth rate in the chiropractic medicines market because of the out of pocket spending and less availability of these services in the region.

Stanley Fischer, the former vice chairman of the US Federal Reserve, said on Friday he would use his new role on the board of Israel's Bank Hapoalim to help it grow as it deals with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Hapoalim, Israel's largest lender, on Thursday elected Fischer to a three-year term on its board of directors.
 Fischer, who previously served as Governor of the Bank of Israel, said: "The Israeli banking system faces many challenges, not least of them resulting from the Coronavirus crisis."
 "I intend to study the bank and its activities in depth, as well as the competitive and regulatory environment, so that I can contribute from my experience to the bank and its growth," he said in a statement.
 Hapoalim's second-quarter profit fell sharply after it set aside a 1.13 billion shekel ($335 million) credit loss provision, which included 806 million shekels as an advance to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
 Fischer said he was confident the bank's management could navigate it through the crisis.
 Fischer headed the Bank of Israel from 2005-2013 and is widely credited with helping the country weather the 2008 financial crisis.
 He served as vice chairman of the US Federal Reserve's Board of Governors from 2014-2017.

September 11th was still pretty recent at that time and the pain of it hadn't even fully set in for a lot of people, so thinking about another tragic and twisted story was kind of difficult for quite a few people, and going to the movies wasn't exactly a balm for a lot of folks since sensationalism wasn't all the rage as a country mourned. This was one of the biggest things working against the movie since casting a few relative unknowns in lead parts was something that could have been worked past. But hiring Swayze, despite the fact that he was a legend all the way up to his passing, and still is in the eyes of many people, also wasn't bound to turn this movie around. His star power has pretty much run out by the 2000s since he was a huge 80s and 90s sensation that had already had his heyday and wasn't on an upswing at that time. Drew Barrymore was a bit underplayed in the movie and to be fair some people might have to be reminded that she was even in it to start with. Apart from all that, the movie was just flat out weird, as many people would be willing to agree with no doubt.

As a result, the company's phase 1 clinical trial can continue to dose new patients, but the next phase won't be allowed to start until Inovio addresses the FDA's concerns. This type of pause is somewhat common in drug development, but in general, it happens to smaller biotech companies more frequently than it does to larger pharmaceutical companies that have more experience in the regulatory approval process. Inovio expects to submit a packet of information to the FDA sometime in October, after which regulators will have 30 days to decide whether to give the trial the green light for a restart. It's unclear whether Inovio has submitted the information yet, but every day that passes is a day in which competitors can move forward with their vaccine projects. A continuous delay could devastate Inovio's stock even more, so it's best to steer clear for the meantime.

It's the little things that separate champions from contenders and one play in Thursday's win-or-go-home Game 3 at Heritage was proof positive.
 Down 4-0 in the top of the fourth inning and with the leadoff runner at second base, Jefferson's Abby Beatty attempted a sacrifice bunt to try and move the runner over to third.
 The ball quickly caromed off Beatty's bat, well into foul territory between home plate and third base, and would have harmlessly fallen to the turf.
 But even with Heritage senior ace Rachel Gibson locked in and mowing down hitters left and right, senior third baseman Bailey Christol was leaving nothing to chance.
 Christol, who broke for the plate when Beatty squared around to bunt, stopped on a dime, shifted her body a full 90 degrees on a dead sprint and fearlessly layed out full extension in foul territory to make an unbelievable diving catch, finishing the play with her head merely inches from the concrete wall surrounding the infield.
 The runners would eventually be left stranded at second and, soon thereafter, top-ranked Heritage would be moving on to the Elite Eight with a 7-0 victory over the seventh-ranked Lady Dragons in the deciding game of their three-game Class AAAA second-round series.
 "That's the play you dream about making as a little kid, especially when it's the most important game in your life because that's what it is right now," Christol said. "Every game that's the next game is the most important one."
 The future West Georgia Wolf had already helped the Generals take a big step in their quest for a Class AAAA state championship three-peat earlier in the game.
 After Savannah Wilson dropped down a bunt with the bases loaded in the bottom of the second inning to bring in Bailey Davis with the initial run of the game, Christol got down in the count, 0-2, but fouled off three straight pitches before burning a drawn-in outfield with a two-out, three-run triple to left-center to make it 4-0.
 "I've been struggling this series and I've been nervous this year because (this year) is the most important one to me," she added. "But I finally got my bat going and it felt good to get back to it."
 "This is the type of game when you want your seniors to step up," head coach Tanner Moore said. "(Bailey) did an unbelievable job, down 0-2, and she had to fight off three really good pitches. But (Jefferson's pitcher) threw a change- up that she hung and that hit turned the ball game. It was a huge swing."
 Although Gibson was cruising, apart from Mac Turner's fourth-inning, two- bagger, Heritage made sure of the victory with three more runs in the top of the sixth. Carmen Gayler led off the inning with a triple before scoring on a flare to left by Davis.
 Moments later, designated player Sarah Haynes muscled an RBI-double to the fence in left. She would move to third as Gracie Dawson beat out a bunt for a hit and later scored as Jefferson threw it away trying to pick her off at third.
 Gibson was in total control all game long. The Clemson commit did not issue a walk, allowing just the one hit in seven innings. She finished the game with 15 strikeouts, while 71 of her 95 pitches went for strikes.
 Haynes, Dawson and Madeline Stone had two hits each in the 10-hit attack.
 "Give credit to Jefferson. They did an unbelievable job, especially in Game 1 (a 2-0 Jefferson win) by executing what they need to do to beat us," Moore reflected. "They pushed us to the brink and had us against the wall, but our girls fought. They came together after Game 1 and they knew that wasn't the way they were capable of playing. Today, they just relaxed and played the way they knew how to play."
 "We knew we had to get pressure on them and get out to a lead in Game 2 (a 6-0 Heritage win) and we did that," Moore added. "Rachel was able to hold them until we got a big enough lead where Kelsey (Anderson) could come in and shut the door. That was big, big thing for Kelsey to come in as a freshman and do that and give Rachel the luxury of a little time off to rest before Game 3."
 Up next for Heritage is a 300-plus mile trip to the southwest corner of the state, right on the Florida line, to face Bainbridge. The Region 1 champion Lady Bearcats are unranked, but have one of the top pitchers in the state in flamethrower Lexie Delbrey, a University of Florida commitment, who has an ERA under 1.00 for her career.
 Heritage must make the long drive after Bainbridge's side of the bracket won Thursday's universal coin flip by the GHSA. The best-of-three series is set to begin on Tuesday with a doubleheader. The winner will advance to Columbus next weekend for the Final Four.
 "It's going to be a long trip to Bainbridge, but it's going to be a Clemson commit against a Florida commit," Moore said. "That should be fun."
 Region 7-AAAA could potentially have three of the final four teams in Columbus.
 No. 2 seed Central-Carroll took its deciding Game 3 against North Oconee on Friday, 6-2, to advance to a quarterfinal series against Region 1 runner-up Thomas County Central, while No. 3 seed Cedartown swept Region 8 champion Flowery Branch on Thursday to earn a series against Region 2 champion LaGrange.
 The other series will pit Region 4 champion West Laurens against Region 8 runner-up Madison County.

A simple and straightforward protest, primarily about police brutality and national insecurity, that was put together by different groups of very bright Nigerians was turned into a theatre of war and their blood flowed due to no fault of theirs. The protesters had turned the Lagos LEKKI Tollgate into our own Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China. We’ve never witnessed such orderly, accountable, visionary and transparently honest organisers in this clime. We were all excited that for once we are much closer to our destination. But the forces of darkness, as usual, were hovering in the wings, with their fiendish plans. As masters of the game, they struck unashamedly. In Abuja and Lagos, they brought out their hirelings with daggers, cutlasses and cudgels. As if bewitched, we saw some young people, some looking underaged, with bloodshot eyes who were ready to inflict maximum damage on the two most important cities in Nigeria and its inhabitants. The one in Abuja looked coordinated, as in broad day light we saw hooligans and thugs being corralled and marshalled by agents of State and ushered into areas of pacifist protests that these hoodlums would turn into hotspots of bedlam and mayhem.

“This is not only the election campaign but also a struggle for your rights continued for many years. Now in the last phase, Islamabad will have to listen to our demands and voice,” he said.
 Bilawal said now Imran Khan is throwing people out of their jobs and we will have to stop that. He said we cannot give Imran Khan an opportunity to destroy Gilgit Baltistan as he lied to the people of Pakistan and did not fulfill any of his promises. “Imran promised to provide 10 million jobs but millions were rendered jobless. He promised five million houses, instead thousands were demolished in the name of anti-encroachment”.
 Bilawal said people of Gilgit Baltistan will have to make the PPP successful from all constituencies in Gilgit Baltistan to fulfil their demands. He said the promises which he (Imran) has made to you are the demands of the people of GB and we will continue to ask Islamabad that why the youth of GB have no employment, why people do not have educational and health institutions. “I will make the dreams come true which Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto had envisioned for you,” he said.
 The chairman PPP said the PPP has always worked for the poor of this country from the time of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to the time of Asif Ali Zardari. “We have always worked for the poor, the laborers and the growers”.
 Bilawal said the wheat subsidy which Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had started for Gilgit Baltistan is still feeding the poor people of Gilgit Baltistan.
 He said that Ghanche is the district of Bhuttos from the very beginning. “Now you will elect Mohammad Jafar, Engineer Ismail and Ghulam Haidari from the three seats of Ghanche district”.
 Bilawal said he also wants to serve the people of GB like Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto. “We will establish hospitals for women and children. We started Lady Health Visitors program which is still helping the poor people of GB. Gilgit Baltistan people have to stamp the arrow on the ballot so that we can realise the dreams of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto.”

During the past week, Rep. Adam Schiff's opponent falsely accused him of being related to George Soros, the Jewish Democratic mega-donor who is a constant target of right-wing criticism.
 In an interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Schiff said the Soros meme fit into a pattern of bigotry condoned by the very top of the Republican party. Schiff accused not only President Donald Trump but Republican congressional leaders of encouraging antisemitism through criticism of Soros, which has become unrelenting in this election cycle and frequently veers into antisemitism.
 Schiff, the Jewish Democratic congressman from California who led the House's impeachment inquiry of Trump last year, also floated the idea of Congress removing legal immunity from social networks that fail to crack down on hate if their recent steps to curb bigotry prove insufficient.
 "My Republican colleagues are the ones amplifying these antisemitic attacks on George Soros or myself," Schiff told JTA. "They're pushed out by the Republican leadership. People like Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise have amplified these antisemitic attacks in their own social media."
 In 2018, McCarthy, the House Republican leader, posted a tweet reading "We cannot allow Soros, Steyer and Bloomberg to BUY this election!" referencing three donors with Jewish heritage. That same year, Scalise, a Republican congressman from Louisiana who serves as minority whip, blamed "radical, Soros-backed elements of the Democratic Party" for violence against Republicans.
 While progressive Jewish activists have openly accused McCarthy and Scalise of spreading antisemitism, Schiff's charge is "highly unusual" coming from a senior Democratic congressman, according to Steve Rabinowitz, a longtime Jewish Democratic strategist who said he agrees with Schiff's assessment. Schiff chairs the House Intelligence Committee.
 McCarthy and Scalise have both denied that they are antisemitic. In 2019, McCarthy said on Fox News that his tweet "had nothing to do about faith; that was about Republicans versus Democrats." Scalise's spokesperson told JTA that, especially as a past victim of a politically motivated shooting, it is "absurd" to accuse him of antisemitism.
 McCarthy's office did not respond to a JTA request for comment.
 "Scalise is a victim of political violence himself; it is absurd and offensive to accuse him of engaging in that behavior," the spokesperson said. "George Soros is a known leftist; that has nothing to do with him also being Jewish. Scalise has long been outspoken against antisemitism in any form, and is a longtime ally of the Jewish community. To suggest anything to the contrary is ridiculous."
 Schiff, who has represented a Los Angeles County congressional district since 2001, is considered a shoo-in to keep his seat in his heavily Democratic district. But his challenger, Eric Early, is drawing on a playbook that has made their race a West Coast version of the race between an establishment Democrat and inflammatory Republican that's rattling South Florida right now. There, as in Schiff's district, both contenders are Jewish, with the Republican insurgent unafraid to make personal and sometimes false accusations about the Democrat they are looking to unseat.
 Speaking to JTA, Early, a lawyer, rejected the notion that his rhetoric about Soros was antisemitic, and said criticism of Soros should not be out of bounds. In a tweet this week, he also called Soros, a Holocaust survivor, a "Nazi sympathizer." Some of Soros' critics falsely allege that he aided the Nazis, when he was in fact being hidden from them under a fake name as a child.
 Early, who is Jewish, said he had drawn conclusions about Soros based on his own research.
 "That's what I've heard and read over the years, and that's all I will say about it," he said. "I don't know what Mr. Soros was doing during the Holocaust. The Holocaust was one of the most terrible events in human history, and I don't know what he was doing but I certainly have read a lot about what he's been accused of during that time."
 Early said he believed that antisemitism in the United States was primarily emanating from the anti-Israel left, and specifically called out "The Squad," a group of four progressive freshman Democratic representatives, including two who vocally support boycotting Israel. Early claimed that The Squad, which has a high profile but little institutional power, controls the Democratic Party.
 He also claimed, falsely, that Schiff has not criticized anti-Israel statements from the Democratic Party. In fact, when Rep. Ilhan Omar suggested last year that AIPAC pays congressmen to be pro-Israel, Schiff did call on Omar to apologize and said he was "deeply dismayed" by her comments. Omar apologized following similar calls from across Congress.
 "The Democrat Party right now is literally being controlled by the Squad members," Early said. "You have a huge group growing in the Democrat caucus and behind the scenes of the Democrat Party that are tremendously antisemitic and frankly want to see Israel wiped off the face of the map."
 The Anti-Defamation League and the Department of Homeland Security say that the biggest antisemitic threat in the United States comes from the far right and white supremacists, whom a recent DHS report called the "most persistent and lethal" domestic terror threat in the country.
 Schiff said he wants to ensure that the government pays more attention to domestic threats from white supremacists. Like a range of government officials and security analysts, Schiff worries that violence could result if there's doubt as to the result of the vote.
 "We've already seen militias take matters into their own hands," he said. "You have a plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan. It's all too easy to see a chaotic and potentially violent aftermath given that we have such an unscrupulous president who would be willing to egg it on."
 (This week, Trump turned his attention again to Schiff, saying on Fox News on Tuesday that Schiff was a "sick man" who should be investigated and "ought to be put away.")
 Schiff also said Congress needs to focus on holding tech platforms accountable for the hate published on their platforms. His comments come soon after Facebook, Twitter and YouTube announced a series of steps to crack down on Holocaust denial, hate speech and the QAnon conspiracy theory, which has antisemitic overtones.
 Schiff said that should those steps not prove effective, Congress should think about changing the law that absolves social media of responsibility for most illegal content published on their platforms, including considering "whether to limit that immunity to platforms that are not amplifying or setting their algorithms to amplify extreme content."
 Schiff made similar comments in 2019, well before the social networks' recent actions to curb hate.
 Like other Democrats, Schiff accused Trump of condoning and encouraging antisemitism due to his rhetoric and his repeated declining to condemn white supremacists and conspiracy theories. He said Trump "is normalizing and weaponizing bigotry and antisemitism in all its various forms."
 The president's defenders reject that claim, pointing to his record on Israel and the times he has condemned white supremacists. Vice President Mike Pence said at the vice presidential debate this month that Trump "condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. Your concern that he doesn't condemn neo-Nazis - President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people."
 But Schiff said that even if Trump is defeated on Nov. 3, he still expects antisemitism to pose a threat in the United States.
 "I expect it to persist but I also expect it to decline," he said. "It doesn't mean that antisemitism is going to go away when Donald Trump goes away, or other forms of bigotry, but it won't have the same accelerant. Donald Trump is the fuel to the fires of antisemitism and hate, and his removal will appreciably help the situation."

Kaeda Maegawa, who competes in the 100-meter sprint and long jump, was among those participating in the fashion show and walked down the runway in a lacy white skirt that showcased her metal prosthetic.
 She said she could understand some people are reluctant to reveal their impairment, and worry about being seen as a burden in Japan.
 "But personally, I don't feel that I want to hide my prosthetic leg … I want to send a message that prosthetic legs are cool," the 22-year-old said.
 She is hoping to score a medal at next year's games, but also sees the opportunity to achieve something even bigger.
 "Since the Tokyo Paralympics was awarded, media coverage of para athletes has increased, and because of that more and more people are becoming aware," she said.
 "If you want to change something, knowledge is what's most important."
 Despite the hopes pinned on the games, there are still plenty of unresolved questions about how the event will be staged, with complex discussions on coronavirus countermeasures currently under way.
 The virus issue is particularly serious for some Paralympians, including Tomoya Ito, a two-time Paralympic wheelchair medalist in 400 and 800 meters, who suffers from an immune disorder.
 "For me, there is no way to live with it (the virus)," he warned in a recent interview with local media.
 Murakami, whose husband is a bobsledder aiming for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, remains hopeful Tokyo can pull off the event next year and build a positive legacy for people with impairments.
 "The space for disabled people has been gradually expanding in Japan," she said.
 "I really hope this won't just be a one-time boom but something that continues to grow."

The plan by Liverpool and Manchester United - cutting down the Premier League, stopping ‘parachute’ payments, abolishing the League Cup etc etc and all for a £50 million ‘sweetener’ to the EFL - didn’t take long to get everyone stirred up, and then it was dropped.
 But some good might just come of it.
 One word that’s been bandied around during this coronavirus pandemic is ‘reset’.
 I wouldn’t know where to start on the world’s finances, but I believe that football here has a big chance to look at itself and ‘tweak’ a few things for the better. I’d call it a ‘readjustment’.
 I know people say you’ve got to have change and, after the best part of 40 years in the game, some reckon I’m an old fuddy-duddy.
 But I do think that the culture and depth of our game is a precious thing, probably unique in international sport.
 There’s a reason why foreign owners have bought into our clubs more than anywhere else - and it isn’t out of the goodness of their hearts.
 It’s not a coincidence that the Liverpool and Manchester United owners also run big teams in the USA, where major sport is organised in ‘franchises’.
 They may have done well by the clubs they’ve bought here, but that’s as far as it goes.
 The devil is in the detail with all these things, and you don’t want to be a sprat to catch a mackerel from the Premier League. They give you a little bit, but there’s a danger that they’ll take a lot more.
 There isn’t a lot wrong with our system but the more foreign investment comes in, the more those people want it to change.
 Look what’s happened to the FA Cup. It’s always seemed like a group of them wanted a ‘Super League’ of some kind, and they are increasingly making all the decisions for everyone.
 All through ‘lockdown’, I was trying to champion the idea of the National League becoming the EFL Third Division.
 I really do think it’s that strong now. It’s very professional and almost all full-time, and it shouldn’t be beyond everyone to acknowledge it.
 The EFL has got to change, especially now Covid-19 has exposed how fragile its finances are, and having the National League join, especially in a new relationship with the Premier League, would be a step forward.
 It would strengthen the EFL, not weaken it.
 Everybody knows that football as a whole has got to ‘readjust’ a little bit and, whether ‘Big Picture’ helped or not, it seems like everyone is getting a bit closer to some form of understanding.
 It’s just a matter of how they do it, and also who becomes the real leaders of football in this country. Who is it, by the way?
 Because if that unique culture and the values of English football goes, we will start losing supporters, from the top to the bottom of the game.
 Finally this week, a big ‘WELL DONE’ to Rob Baxter and the Exeter Chiefs for their fantastic achievement in winning rugby’s European Champions Cup.
 From the journey they’ve been on and now to see them as the undisputed No.1s should be an inspiration to us all!
 Stay safe, and fingers-crossed for another big week coming up for the Gulls.

Having city leaders in commercials for the casino is the very reason the public feels that it is a done deal and is silenced on the issue. Casinos are not sustainable and in the long term, social and ecosystems cannot support them. All casinos are by nature boom or bust, looking in the long term. The term “boom or bust” means intrinsically that busting is inevitable eventually, so failure and collapse is inevitable. City leaders are not planning for the long term, when they encourage this casino, and whatever thoughts they have about sustainable development are blindsided by the glitz and glamor of the gambling arena. Because of this, I think the leaders who ended up in the commercials for Jim McGlothlin are drawing unprofessional alliances that will eventually be regretted.

"It's a window of opportunity," the 37-year-old told AFP during a training session in Chiba.
 "I hope that the Paralympics will be a chance for people to realize that people (with disabilities) live among them" and are part of society, she added.
 The decision to delay the Paralympics, now set to open in August 2021, following the rescheduled Olympics, was devastating at first, said Murakami, who lost her right leg in a train accident when she was 25 and competes with a prosthetic blade.
 "I'd worked so hard, and was planning to retire after the 2020 Paralympics … I felt so down and I couldn't get back to being positive," she said.
 But gradually, she said, she felt her motivation return, and she decided to resume training with the goal of qualifying for the postponed Paralympics.
 "If I can win a ticket, I will do my best to jump for a medal," she said.
 Tokyo has worked to improve access for people with impairments and also promote Paralympic sports ahead of the games, but activists and experts warn there is a long way to go.
 Even Japanese citizens feel their society has room for improvement with 84% of the respondents in a 2017 government survey saying they believe there is discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities.
 "Japan has not so far been used to accepting diversity," said Motoaki Fujita, a professor of sports sociology at Nihon Fukushi University.
 "In Japan, the way people are evaluated often depends on whether they are seen as being productive or producing economic value," he told AFP.
 There have been improvements since Tokyo won the bid to host the games, he said, but those could be undone.
 "The results will be totally different if the games are canceled."
 In the runup to the Paralympics, there have been efforts to increase the visibility of people with impairments — with broadcasters hiring reporters with impairments, and events such as a fashion show featuring models, some who are also athletes, with prosthetic limbs.

So it was my idea to doll her up. I thought she should look sexy. ... So that was really my input to the writing, which I ultimately think made it a little more real and not so difficult to take.

It was an artful way of saying Tricky Dick, was, in fact, Tricky Dick.
 But Trump just goes right for the jugular.
 “He’s been a corrupt politician for a long time,” he says about that future inmate Biden.
 Trump knows that no matter what he says, it will generate rounds of exuberant applause on the stump.
 He doesn’t have the courage to do what Sen. John McCain did twice within minutes at a campaign stop in October 2008.
 One man stood up at a town hall meeting and told McCain he was scared of an Obama presidency.
 “First of all, I want to be president of the United States. And obviously, I do not want Senator Obama to be pesident of the United States. But I have to tell you, he is a decent person. And a person you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States,” McCain told the man.
 That was followed by an elderly lady who claimed Obama is an Arab.
 “No, ma’am,” he said. “He’s a decent family man, citizen, that I just have disagreements with on fundamental issues,” he added. “That’s what this campaign is all about."
 McCain could have easily called for Obama to be fitted with leg irons and hauled off to prison.
 He didn’t. That showed character.
 Trump, though, wants us to think of his opponents – or anybody who challenges him in any way – as “criminals.”
 To him, that’s part of his appeal.
 He’s like that motorcycle cop played by Larry Storch in the 1964 madcap comedy, “Sex and the Single Girl.”
 He feels he’s getting no respect from the people he’s trying to issue tickets, so he yells out, “Everybody everywhere is under arrest.”

 Pogba's return from injury after lockdown complimented the midfield perfectly with United's dynamic duo now transformed into a tremendous trio which went the remainder of the league season unbeaten.
 Matic had established himself as the most reliable defensive midfielder at the club, with United's line-up largey predictable in every game they played. Yet while the familiarity boosted United's confidence on the pitch it also made them far too formulaic in their approach with opponents easily able to anticipate what was coming their way.

"He put on a show tonight," Laurel Highlands coach Rich Kolesar said.
 Trinity wasn't done yet.
 A 4-yard touchdown run by Tyson Brophy, the second of the game for the 6-foot-2, 265-pound senior who usually plays right guard for the Hillers, and Dante Derubbo's extra point cut the gap to 34-27.
 Trinity's defense held and the offense drove down field and scored again on quarterback Connor Roberts' 7-yard run to pull within 34-33 with 42.4 seconds remaining.
 Hillers coach Jon Miller opted for a 2-point conversion attempt and put the ball in the hands of Brophy again but this time the Mustangs defense held its ground and stopped the hulking runner a yard short of the goal line.
 "They put in their big kid that had already run for two touchdowns," Kolesar said. "We knew exactly what was coming. Our theme this week is we've got to learn to finish and that's exactly what we did on that play. It was every hat on the ball driving and the kid bounced it outside and it was just a total team effort to get him down."
 Trinity still had life when Jeremy Sikora's onside kick was recovered by Micah Finley at the LH 48. Again, the Mustangs defense held the fort.
 After a five-yard Trinity penalty and an incomplete pass, Roberts was sacked and then spiked the ball to kill the clock. Roberts' fourth-down pass was broken up and Laurel Highlands had the victory.
 Gallagher completed 7of 18 passes for 156 yards, including an 80-yard TD strike to Demonte Kiss and a 2-yard scoring toss to Jayden Pratt in the third quarter to break a 14-14 tie and help LH build a 27-14 advantage.
 "Rodney had the best game of his high school career so far," Kolesar said. "Throwing, running, two pick-sixes. He played unbelievable."
 Finley's 46-yard touchdown run later in the third quarter made it 27-20 with Derubbo missing his second extra point of the night. That set the stage for the exhilarating finish.

Therefore, it will take more data before we can tell if the small drop-off in infections is to be sustained.
 The biggest changes in Wirral's restrictions which people will see over the weekend are the reopening of gyms and the closing of soft play areas.
 Gyms in the Liverpool City Region had been made to close when Tier 3 rules first came in, while soft play areas were allowed to remain open.
 As other areas such as Lancashire went into Tier 3 the opposite happened, sparking fury among several of Wirral’s gym owners.
 But this week the region’s rules were brought into line with other Tier 3 areas, in a move which came into effect at one minute past midnight on Saturday morning.
 Nick Whitcombe, whose gym Body Tech Fitness, in Moreton, Wirral, was fined £1,000 for refusing to close when Tier 3 rules came in, was over the moon when the news was announced.

According to Frederick Kiragu, a Nairobi based counseling psychologist, these shouting matches are motivated by a woman thinking that a man will be least likely to lose his temper in public.   "A usually short-tempered man will not stand up to her, she assumes. Plus, she will have the upper hand in the argument. If things spill out of control, she also hopes to have the sympathy of the observers," he says.   Sadly, this doesn't always work and we have seen women beaten black and blue in public.   According to him, these couples usually have underlying problems in their union than what is said during those arguments.   After witnessing the rather messy public showdown two weekends ago, James Njue, says when couples fight in public, emotions flare and words are thrown around and the primary issue remains unresolved.   "The woman got nothing from it apart from the beating," Njue, who has been married for four years, laments.

The peer leaders then tried to communicate on Facebook with men who had volunteered to participate in a study. Because there are no best practices for using social media to communicate health information, the peer leaders had to make it up as they went along. First, they tried a friendly message and then some social chat, with messages tailored to the participants' interests. Then they invited participants to join either a closed Facebook group with information on HIV prevention, or if they were in the control group, on general health.

Design
 The iPhone 12 made a splash with its throwback design. Apple brought back the flat, squared-off edges, which differentiate the iPhone 12 from rivals that favor curved sides. The new flagship also comes in new blue hues, dark blue for the iPhone 12 and Pacific blue for the 12 Pro. The Pixel 5 has a more minimalist design, with a hole-punch camera, thin bezels and a flush rear camera setup.
 One area where the Pixel 5 beats the iPhone 12, at least on paper, is its 90Hz screen refresh rate. Apple's flagship has a 60Hz display. Having a 90Hz display means the screen refreshes 90 frames a second, making scrolling smoother. Keep in mind that the Pixel 5's refresh rate is dynamic, much like many other 90 or 120Hz phones. The phone will revert to 60Hz when the higher refresh rate is not needed, such as when the screen is static, to help save battery.
 The iPhone 12 and Pixel 5 are nearly identical in size. The iPhone 12 is slightly larger, with a 6.1-inch screen compared to the Pixel 5's 6-inch display. The iPhone 12 is also heavier at 5.78 ounces to the Pixel 5's 5.33 ounces. But because the iPhone 12 comes in four variants and three sizes, small- or big-handed people will surely find an iPhone that fits. The iPhone 12 Mini features a 5.4-inch display, and the Pro Max is a whopping 6.7 inches. You can compare all the dimensions and other specs between Apple's four iPhone 12 models here.

In the MCU version though, Makkari will be taken on by Lauren Ridloff, who starred in The Walking Dead and will be playing the first deaf superhero. Not only is Makkari getting a gender swap, but the character will be played by a female POC that also has a disability, which is interesting, to say the least. No one is doubting Ridloff's ability to act since on TWD she's been quite convincing and has also added a good bit to the show. But while she's not the first actor to be placed on the Eternals cast that people didn't expect, it's also an interest to many that such a thing is happening at all since the idea of keeping to the source material has long been something that people would hope for. In recent years though this has obviously been less of a concern than some might think since there have been a few characters that have been swapped out throughout the years when it comes to comic book adaptations in the movies and in TV shows. It's not that much of a problem so long as the actor taking on the role can make it work, and so far there's a lot of faith in Lauren, though we'll have to wait and see what happens in the movie, whenever it gets the chance to finally show up in theaters.

_Tempers flare during Dagenham & Redbridge vs Yeovil Town, Vanarama National League Football at the Chigwell Construction Stadium on 17th October 2020_
 Well, it had been a fairly quiet week, but then what would take place on Friday afternoon was something nobody could predict – the return of a club legend. With supporters content with the signing of Scott Wilson; they were about to be sent into ecstasy – ‘Abu Ogogo Returns’ – sent into ecstasy by those three words!
 It’s crazy how one afternoon, one loan signing, can turn the mood of a fan base on its head. But, I mean what a signing, this just proves that when Peter Freund told my blog Digger Dagger Matchday, ‘[his] consortium are more committed than ever’, he stayed true to his word.
 We’ll get back to Ogogo returning momentarily, but I’d also like to give the signing of Scott Wilson a mention, he’ll probably appear on the team sheet today and everyone will wonder who he is as – let’s be honest – there has only been one name going around town. Wilson is most likely a replacement for McCallum who is ‘out for a while’ as McMahon said in his Thursday press conference; so too is Adrian Clifton.
 I must say, he is a first-class replacement and hopefully he makes some noise on the pitch, the 28-year old forward, as little was made about him off it with his announcement somewhat overshadowed. Wilson has 54 appearances in League Two for Macclesfield and Oldham and has played 69 times with in the National League with the Silkmen and Eastleigh. The new number 25 was the top scorer for Macclesfield in both of his seasons with them.
  _Rhys Murphy of Yeovil Town hits the post during Dagenham & Redbridge vs Yeovil Town, Vanarama National League Football at the Chigwell Construction Stadium on 17th October 2020_
 So, with the permanent signing of Wilson secured the ex-Daggers captain’s arrival was announced and even though it’s a loan until January – that didn’t detract any excitement. Abu has made over 200 appearances for the club over 6 seasons and he played all 90 minutes in THAT play-off final victory over Rotherham. A fans’ favourite, Ogogo is to again add that fight in the red and blue of Dagenham & Redbridge at the heart of the midfield - over five years on from his last appearance at Victoria Road.
 I will touch on the game that featured a few of Ogogo’s old Daggers teammates, the game that feels like a while ago now, but only took place last Saturday – at home to Yeovil. Now, from an established club legend to a player who may grow into one and that man is keeper, Elliot Justham, who yet again showed just why he is one of the best in the league between the sticks. It was his save ultimately that denied Murphy a goal against his former club that kept the Daggers in the game.
