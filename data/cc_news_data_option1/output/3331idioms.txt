Public health experts have called into question why sentinel surveillance study, which should ideally provide early warning signals and trends about the probable course of COVID-19, has failed to give the State any advantage so far in combating the pandemic.
 Three rounds of surveillance study from April-July, which tested exactly 1,18,554 (till July 31), and epidemiological samples later, the data garnered from this exercise is very much at variance with the actual picture of COVID-19 now unfolding in the State, with all districts reporting an average of 200 cases daily.
 Sentinel surveillance studies are being done in specific chosen populations who are assessed to be at high risk of contracting COVID-19 in the community.
 Between April and July, the test positivity (proportion of people who test positive amongst all tested) recorded by the sentinel survey ranged from 0.10 to 0.59. In June when the case graph of the State had really been climbing, only 38 out of the 17,079 samples from the high risk groups had tested positive. In July, just 205 out of the 35,038 samples tested positive.
 “The huge variance in the data emerging out of the sentinel surveillance and the actual situation in the community begs the question whether this surveillance study is serving any purpose. The State’s current testing strategy focuses on testing all influenza like illness (ILI) cases in the community. It is a bit far-fetched that after testing 11,616 ILI samples in June-July, the sentinel survey picked up just 11 COVID-19 cases,” a public health expert said.
 He also questioned why the official report of sentinel surveillance Round 3 has omitted the results of the samples tested from one of the groups (Group 6, epidemiological samples collected from community/hospital).
 The sentinel surveillance should ideally have been an epidemiological exercise planned and executed at the district-level rather than a centralised plan, he said.
 The official report concludes that “it is very evident that cases and positivity are more in clusters, whereas in the general population, the positivity still remains low.”
 “Even when the credibility of the entire survey process is under fire, no questions are being raised about possible flaws in study design, implementation or data interpretation because it suits the political narrative that community transmission is not widespread in the State,” a senior epidemiologist said on condition of anonymity.

China has since July 22 been administering its domestically-developed COVID-19 vaccines to a broad range of people whose number may soon be in the hundreds of thousands, including medical workers, the armed forces, and employees of companies who are working overseas on Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, said a health official on August 22.
 China has eight different vaccines which are going through clinical trials, and none have so far been approved for the market. Some of the vaccines have, however, been administered on an “urgent use” basis for the past month, Zheng Zhongwei, director of the Development Centre for Medical Science and Technology of the National Health Commission, which is leading the vaccine development programme, told State media.
 Authorities have permitted administering vaccines to medical workers, border officers and those employed overseas, while the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has also begun inoculating military personnel. Vaccines are being administered in two doses, with the second given one month after the first shot.
 “The number of people being vaccinated on an urgent basis may reach hundreds of thousands across China, considering that personnel in wider sectors are being offered free injections,” Tao Lina, an immunology expert, was quoted as saying by the Communist Party-run newspaper, _Global Times_. “But it’s difficult to give an accurate figure since the Chinese military has begun mass vaccinations but has not released details.”
 That number could rise further by this winter. Mr. Zheng said that ahead of a possible wave of cases this winter, the vaccines would be made available “to people working in food markets, transport systems and services industries.” Those who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 will not be among the early group.
 Mr. Zheng said when the vaccine reaches the market, it would be priced slightly lower than the estimate given by one of the producers, Sinopharm, of around 1,000 Yuan, or ₹10,800 for two shots. Sinopharm has said a vaccine may be given the green light for marketing by the end of the year, which was “dependent on the progress of late-stage clinical trials overseas”. More than 20,000 people in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had taken vaccines in Phase Three clinical trials, while Sinopharm has signed agreements with three other countries, Peru, Morocco and Argentina, for trials.
 The _Global Times_ quoted an employee of a state-run enterprise working on overseas projects as part of the BRI as saying “all staff in her company have been offered inactivated vaccine injections on a voluntary basis for free.” The employee took the vaccine on August 7 and said “at least 10% of the employees, mainly those in charge of projects overseas, have been vaccinated in groups since they were notified on July 30.”
 The inoculation of workers going overseas has, however, raised questions with some of the countries receiving them, with Papua New Guinea barring the entry of Chinese workers on a mine project who had been inoculated on August 10 before travelling.

Illinois now has a constitutionally mandated flat-rate tax that taxes all personal income at the same rate of 4.95%.
 Under a graduated-rate income tax, different levels of wages are taxed at different rates. Proponents say higher income taxpayers should bear a greater tax burden than lower income taxpayers. Opponents say a graduated tax hurts business owners and job creators and makes them the target of future tax hikes. Raising taxes across the board under a flat tax is more difficult to do, they say.
 How does a graduated rate tax work?
 When a state imposes a graduated income tax, it separates the pay scale into a number of fixed income brackets and determines a different tax rate for each bracket, called a marginal rate.
 These brackets apply to every individual taxpayer’s income — the first bracket of your income will be taxed at the lowest rate, the second bracket at the second lowest rate, and so on. Ultimately, one’s average tax rate will be lower than their final marginal rate.

She said it took a while to order the supplies in order to figure out how many kids the event could serve, and several days to put the backpacks together after sanitizing everything in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The backpacks were split up between elementary school students and high school students, with the supplies in each backpack geared toward those needs.
 As of now, there were a total of about 500 kids signed up for the backpack event between the two Saturdays.
 “We had a boy come in here – he’s fighting leukemia – and I just, I started crying. He was here, he was smiling and he was so strong.

We tried to kind of hit those who needed it the most, because it makes it all worthwhile.”

For instance, sleep timing is apparently defined as being optimal when “the midpoint of your sleep falls between midnight and 3 am.” This is presented as a way of measuring whether your circadian rhythms are in tune or out of whack but it’s not an easily understood or common metric featured on most sleep trackers.

Gerald Towler      Waverly - Gerald Ray Towler, 86, passed from this life on August 21, 2020 at his home in Waverly, Ohio. He had battled pancreatic cancer for 8 months with his four faithful sons holding vigil at his side. Jerry was born August 8, 1934 to Raymond and Edith Towler in Manchester, Ohio. On May 16, 1954 he married Lois Ann Scott and moved to Waverly to begin a family and career. He began his career as a draftsman for the Goodyear Atomic Corp in Piketon, Ohio and retired 44 years later as an engineer.      Jerry was a committed husband and father, ever-present at his sons' school activities, sporting events, and life moments. He selflessly served as baseball coach, school board member, boy scout leader, headed civic projects and supported numerous charitable organizations. He was a man of great Christian faith demonstrated by his loving gentle spirit. He ended each day in God's Word and prayer, was a passionate Sunday School teacher and served His Lord in various leadership positions. He had a servant's heart whether it be communion or pancakes.      He was preceded in death by his loving wife Lois, his parents and his devoted sister, Laura "Peg" Chandler. Surviving are his four sons, Brian A (Judy) Towler of Chillicothe, Ohio, Craig S (Susan) Towler of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Gary R. (Penny) of Waverly, Ohio and John D. (Nissa) of Gahanna, Ohio. Jerry adored his seven granddaughters and two grandsons and seven great- granddaughters and two great grandsons. Also surviving is a special friend, Bonnie Rhoads, whom he shared many meals and great times at the country music jamborees.      A special expression of gratitude is extended to the professional and caring staffs of NCR Hospice and PCM Home Care for their kindness and comfort during our fathers last days. In light of Covid-19 no public visitation will be observed. A private graveside service will be held on Monday, August 24, 2020 with Pastor Dan Evory officiating.

If all it takes to make it in Japan is to literally have big balls, wouldn’t any statue that’s a mix between scrotal elephantiasis and indecent exposure do the trick? Actually, no. In Japanese culture, it has to be a tanuki. The most popular theory as to why, as championed by researcher Shigeo Owaku, goes back to metal workers in Kanazawa Prefecture many centuries ago. Apparently, to make gold leaf sheets, these craftsmen would put gold between tanuki skin to hammer it flat, and because the skin was so durable, it allowed them to stretch the metal unbelievably thin. Then the gold bit (as in “kintama”) got mixed with the notion of stretching and skin – and landed safely on a giant cushion of tanuki testes.

A woman was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of drugs after a car crashed into a house in Leavenworth, a police spokesman said.
   
 The crash was reported at about 9 p.m. Thursday in the 1100 block of Quincy Street. Leavenworth Police Chief Pat Kitchens said dispatchers were told a woman may have fled from the crash scene on foot.
   
 Officers arrived on the scene and found that car had crashed into the front porch of a house.
   
 "No one was injured," Kitchens said.
   
 He said officers found items in the vehicle, a 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, that pointed to the identity of the owner and possibly the driver.
   
 Police located the 33-year-old woman they believe had been driving the car at the time of the crash. Officers believe the woman may have been impaired by drugs.
   
 She was arrested for an alleged DUI.
   
 Kitchens said the woman also had a suspended driver's license, and a warrant had been issued for her arrest in Meade County.
   
 Kitchens said the primary damage to the house was to the front porch.

Two Metro drivers, Samina Hameed and Mike Winkler, have since died after contracting the virus. Nationwide, at least 200 transit workers have died, unions say. An unknown number have gotten sick.
 Public transit — a system at its most efficient when buses and trains are full — has been remade by COVID-19. Ridership has plummeted and agencies have scrambled to keep drivers and passengers safe as tax revenues evaporate. Six months into the local outbreak, transit workers and riders wonder how they will be protected as the virus rages on and parts of the economy reopen.
 Like reopening schools, making public transit safe will be key to managing the spread of the virus and ramping up reopening. And like schools, restaurants and other facets of once-normal life, transit could look dramatically different if the pandemic stretches on.
 Agencies around the globe are examining ideas for safety precautions, like plexiglass shields to wall off drivers and vending machines to sell masks, and more novel efforts like ultraviolet light to zap the virus and artificial intelligence to spot transit stations with low mask use.
 “If we want to get the economy up and running again, we need to make transit available and safe,” said Dr. Jerry Cangelosi, a professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Washington.
 For drivers labeled first responders early in the local outbreak, that status has outlasted what many imagined. On private transit operator Facebook groups, remembrances for drivers appear from across the country.

Meghan Markle may be finding herself leaning towards politics after her brief royal journey came to end but her husband Prince Harry is steering clear of it.  
 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have found themselves delving towards a myriad things as they start anew in Santa Barbara, and while the former actor becomes a source of guidance for Harry in his journey of comprehending social justice issues, he won’t be looking to go a step further like she would.
 Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliam told _Express_ about what causes he expects the couple to focus on.
 "Harry is on a journey which is very 'woke.' Apart from Invictus and mental health, he will champion other charitable causes but will avoid party politics,” said Fitzwilliam.
 “Meghan’s case is unique. She would obviously be superb as a political activist campaigning on issues such as gender equality and diversity,” he added.
 He went on to say that the couple’s new biography _Finding Freedom_ may have angered the public in the UK but their main target audience had always been in the US. "Both of them feel strongly about what they class as hate speech online and privacy.
 "After their dreadful handling of Finding Freedom, they will get less support in Britain. However they are aiming at an American market. Their arrangement which the Queen brokered at Sandringham will be reviewed by the end of March next year,” said Fitzwilliam.
 "Calls for Meghan to lose her royal title because of what is perceived as political comments are wide of the mark at the moment,” he continued.
 Speaking about their new charity called Archewell, Fitzwilliam said: "They will launch their non-profit organisation Archewell when the pandemic permits. Then with friends who can open any door in Hollywood who knows what the future holds!"

Andover returns a bulk of their talent that took them to third place in the Class 5A state tournament last year and are set to make a run toward that State Championship.
   
 Head coach Steve Alexander is aware of what is awaiting their first match on September 3.
   
 "We just want to keep building off last year's success," Alexander said.
   
 That success sees the lead from the Sinclair sisters. Sarah and Emma finished fifth and ninth at state, respectively. They combined for over 50 wins last season and are set to battle atop the rankings of the singles division once again.
   
 They also return Annabelle Tatemsomboo and Aurelia Tan in doubles. They were sixth in the doubles at 5A state last year. As seniors they will be one of the top doubles teams in the state.
   
 The senior leadership of the Trojans should be enough to overcome the lack of summer preparation due to COVID-19.
   
 "Uncertainty should not prevent us from focusing on our goals," Alexander said.
   
 That leaves room for a doubles pair to step up in the #2 doubles position. A handful of freshmen could step into that role and provide those extra points to push Andover into a State Championship team. Anna Jittawait, Brooke Walker, Hannah Pappademos, Katlyn Aune will all be vying for time.
   
 The Trojans do lose Hannah Weers and Sydney Benjamin, as they were state qualifiers as well.
   
 Is it State Championship or bust for the Trojans? That remains to be seen. They should be a top three team at state once again if everything goes right.
   
 "Every player works their hardest, has fun and represents Andover high well, everything else well take care of itself," Alexander said.
   
 Andover Central returns a lot of experience from a year ago with the expectations of improving upon last year's 10th place finish at state.
   
 The Jaguars will return Hilary Tallman, who was a part of a doubles team that finished 10th at state last season. She will team up with Lizzy Kear this season for the top doubles team to start the season. Both seniors will look to get Tallman back to state in a unique looking Class 5A that will see many teams not send teams to the state tournament due COVID-19 issues.
   
 Anna Strickland and Grace Schaefer will start the season out in singles as they combined for 40 wins a season ago. Strickland, a junior, qualified for state last year. She had a three-set thriller in her opening match at 5A State.
   
 "There are a lot of very talented players out there, especially in the 5A classification," Andover Central head coach Janet Glaser said. "We plan to try and manage things on our side of the net and play with tons of energy."
   
 Schaefer, a sophomore, won 19 games as a freshman. She had the unfortunate task of facing Paige Stronghoner in her first regional match last year. Stronghoner finished third at 5A State last season.
   
 Hannah Lee (Sr.) and Mac Evans (So.) will press up into the opening tournament's double roles.
   
 Positions are not set though. There are plenty of players who could step up if given the opportunity. Maggie Uhlenhop (Jr.), Abbie Lester (Jr.), Reece Solberg (So.) could all rise to the occasion this season.
   
 "We have players who love to play, who are very athletic, and who never quit," Glaser said.
   
 They get their season started by hosting an invitational at their new courts on Sept. 8.
   
 "We will strive to be competitive every time we go on court," Glaser said. "Every match is an opportunity for personal growth and game improvement."
   
 Augusta loses a lot of varsity talent from last year and will look to do so with players who played at the junior varsity level this season.
   
 "I'm sure we'll have several 'eye-opener' matches," Stevens said. "These girls will compete and are ready and willing to learn."
   
 Four seniors will slide into the doubles positions. While none registered any varsity matches, coach Stevens is confident they are ready for varsity action.
   
 "We'll learn quickly to identify their strengths and weaknesses," Stevens said.
   
 Until this week, Ashlyn Bowen was anticipated to be the top singles player for the Orioles, but due to college classes, she will step away from tennis.
   
 That leaves room for players like Charlize Lichlyter, a junior, and Peyton Childers, a freshman, to step up and prove they have what it takes.
   
 The season kicks off for the Orioles on Sept. 8 as will take part in the Andover Central Invitational on the new courts at Andover Central High.
   
 Despite setting a school record with 46 wins and finished with a top six position in the Class 4A State Tournament, the Circle Lady Thunderbirds are looking for more heading into 2020.
   
 Circle sent multiple players to state last year and a plethora of talent for another run at it. With seniors Annabelle Adams and Lanna Chase leading the way, Circle has their eyes on a bigger prize. Adams was the state runner-up in Class 4A singles. The senior is coming off a 28-2 record. Adams rolled through her regional and up to the state championship match but fell to Emma Mantovani of Wichita Collegiate.
   
 Then, there is Chase, she's a three-time state qualifier. Chase went 2-2 in the 4A State Tournament last season after going 22-5 throughout the season. The Big 1-2 combination gives the T-Birds a strong case for one of the best teams in the state.
   
 Cran Chase, who enters his third year as the head coach for Circle has quickly amassed a quality program that can be compared with those of 4A.
   
 "We have a chance to be a very strong team," Circle head coach Cran Chase said. "We are loaded with seniors this year and we also have some juniors that will be battling for varsity time."
   
 Bridget Lindberg, Adisyn Cornali, Kenzi Gillispie and Lauren Madina will all be up for key spots on the varsity squad.
   
 They aren't shying away from competition either. They open the season in the Independence Invitational, which has the Independence Bulldogs, that finished fourth at state last year.
   
 They'll play Wichita Collegiate, Maize and other bigger schools like Salina Central.
   
 "I really like this senior class we have this year," Chase said. "The key will be to figure out the lineups between doubles and seniors."
   
 The sky is the limit for the T-Birds this season.
   
 After one of the best year's in recent memory for the El Dorado tennis team, they will look to reload on the back of sophomore Rylee Marnell-Ball.
   
 "We'll have a lot of big shoes left by the outgoing seniors, not only in terms of skill but also leadership," Kunkel said. "It will be interesting to see how this team shakes out."
   
 Gone are the tandem of Mallory Parsons and Makayla Chabot, who finished 11th in doubles. Also gone is Nalea Payton, who's off to play tennis at Bethel.
   
 "Even though we lost a lot from last year, we still have several jv players who saw some varsity action throughout last season," Kunkel said.
   
 Trinity Lawrence (14-14 last season), a senior, is expected to step into a varsity role this season. Ashlyn Luna (12-7), a junior will also be a varsity player this season.
   
 Marnell-Ball is a name to watch out for. She qualified for state as a freshman with a 20-win season. Other coaches in 4A raved about her skill set.
   
 Marnell-Ball experienced the guantlet last season as a freshman, playing the likes of Brittany Teufel of Buhler, Sonya Murphy of Collegiate and other big time upperclassmen who've all since graduated. Going through the fire last season should have prepared her for this season.
   
 Raegan Barkus, Izzabela Smith and Maya Wade could be sophomores that step into varsity roles this season.
   
 El Dorado starts their season on Saturday, Aug. 29 in Independence against Circle, Independence and Parsons, all top teams at 4A state last year.
   
 "It's going to be interesting to see how this team plays out," Kunkel said. "We'll try to improve on each previous match."

Like in businesses and on state ferries, mask disputes could be an enduring challenge. By October, Metro plans to install mask dispensers on board buses, starting with high-ridership routes, a spokesperson said.
 When an unmasked rider boarded a Route 10 bus on a recent Thursday afternoon, the driver nudged the passenger over the speaker system, saying the rider was free to get off the bus and wait for another driver who didn’t mind an unmasked passenger. The passenger masked up.
 In complaints to the Washington Department of Labor & Industries (L&I), Metro operators, who also drive Sound Transit buses, raised concerns about passengers boarding through the front doors on Sound Transit buses as well as the rule barring drivers from refusing riders without masks, employees gathering in proximity at a bus base and alleged poor quality of KN95 masks provided by Metro.

Like flea markets, social media is very chaotic, bothering anarchic and very fast-paced. Information or knowledge is often only validated when trended by a trendy source. We, however, forget the problem with trends is that they disappear as fast as they emerged so rather than create a sustainable chain of positive reaction - the hashtags become momentarily fleeting and hardly ever leads to substantive reform.

Many never came home; nearly 200 Native children are buried at the entrance of the Carlisle barracks. Effie, at 18, survived and traveled to Lawrence, Kansas, to attend Haskell Indian School in 1918.

While testing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3's workout video streaming feature, I made the egregious mistake of doing about 200 squats and an absurd number of burpees in about 25 minutes. The next day I was unable to walk as my glutes decided they were absolutely done with my bullshit. However, Oura gave me a readiness score of 89 and suggested that day was a good one to go ham on training. In reality, I was unable to walk to the kitchen without waddling like a penguin. On another day, I had an okay-ish score of 79 and it told me to take it easy when actually I felt super rested and ran my best 3-mile time in months. This was something I came across when testing Whoop as well. Oura’s graphs and app are definitely more streamlined and easier to understand, but at least with Whoop’s graphs, I could see that my delayed-onset muscle soreness was reflected in my low heart rate variation scores. I wasn’t quite as able to do that with the Oura Ring.

The city council voted 7-1 this month to slash its police budget. The one vote against was not in defense of police; that council member voted against the cuts because they did not go far enough. The anti-police activist groups, who by and large have the media's ear in Seattle as they do in every major city, slammed the cuts as not going far enough. Media never turn and ask any real questions of those activist groups, such as "When crime inevitably spikes and people die because the city council did what you want them to do, will you apologize to the mothers of those victims?"

The Paris Saint-Germain of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe go after a first-ever Champions League crown in a final behind closed doors in Lisbon on Sunday, but standing in their way are a fearsome Bayern Munich led by the prolific Robert Lewandowski.
 It is a mouthwatering showdown between two of Europe's super clubs, with PSG eager to cap their rise in the last decade under Qatari ownership and Bayern hoping to lift the trophy for the sixth time.
 Such an occasion deserves to be played in front of a full stadium, but the cavernous, 65,000-seat Estadio da Luz will remain empty.
 No fans are allowed in, as has been the case throughout this unprecedented 'Final Eight' tournament in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "It will be odd to play behind closed doors. We would have liked to have our supporters there but I know they are supporting us where they are. But this is still the Champions League," said Mbappe on Saturday.
 "You still feel all the tension. Everyone wants to win it, especially with this unusual format. Everyone will remember this for a long time because of the tragic events surrounding it."
 While the atmosphere in the ground will be surreal, the match promises to be fascinating, pitting together two teams whose domestic dominance is almost total and who were both comfortable winners in the semi-finals.
 \- 'Go down in history' -
 PSG beat RB Leipzig 3-0 to become the first French representative in the final since Monaco in 2004 and can now become just the second French winner ever, after Marseille in 1993.
 "At the gates of paradise" roared a headline in France's leading sports daily, L'Equipe, on Sunday.
 "This is exactly why I came here. I always said that I wanted to go down in my country's history. (This) is another chance to do that," said Mbappe.
 If PSG represent, in the eyes of many, the nouveau riche, Bayern are one of the continent's traditional giants. This is their 11th final.
 The last of their five victories came in 2013. Four starters from that victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley -- goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, David Alaba and Thomas Mueller -- could play here. Boateng is expected to start after a hamstring injury.
 The game comes exactly 50 years after PSG's first official match. When, in 1974, Bayern won their first European Cup, PSG were just winning promotion to France's top flight.
 Leaving aside their storied past, Bayern appear the most formidable team in Europe just now.
 Their 3-0 semi-final win over Lyon was their 20th consecutive victory. They are unbeaten in 29 matches since December last year under coach Hansi Flick.
 They have already pocketed a German league and cup double, with the Bundesliga title their eighth in a row.
 They have won all 10 Champions League matches this season, scoring 42 goals, including a 7-2 win at Tottenham Hotspur and the 8-2 quarter-final demolition of Barcelona.
 \- Bayern's 'small advantage' -
 Lewandowski has 55 goals this season. But he is more than ably supported.
 Bayern take the risk of playing with a high defensive line. Yet it remains to be seen if they can afford to do that against PSG's attack of Neymar, Mbappe and Angel Di Maria.
 "We've always played with a high line and ultimately we've got results doing that so we won't change too much," Flick insisted.
 "Bayern's faith in their own strengths is unwavering," said Munich-based daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday.
 The French champions have themselves lost once since November 1, last year, and they overturned that 2-1 reverse in Dortmund in the last 16 by winning the return leg.
 "It is a small advantage for Bayern that they are used as a club to playing these games. I accept that, but it is not a decisive advantage," said their German coach Thomas Tuchel.
 He was optimistic playmaker Marco Verratti would start after a calf problem. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas is tipped to return after a hamstring injury.
 To the winners, along with the glory, will go huge sums in prize money.
 At the start of the season UEFA set out a prize pot which ensured up to 80 million euros ($94m) would be destined for the winners.
 To that sum can be added close to the same again from television and as a result of the clubs' respective UEFA ranking.

 A woman was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of drugs after a car crashed into a house in Leavenworth, a police spokesman said.
 The crash was reported at about 9 p.m. Thursday in the 1100 block of Quincy Street. Leavenworth Police Chief Pat Kitchens said dispatchers were told a woman may have fled from the crash scene on foot.
 Officers arrived on the scene and found that car had crashed into the front porch of a house.
 \"No one was injured,\" Kitchens said.
 He said officers found items in the vehicle, a 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, that pointed to the identity of the owner and possibly the driver.
 Police located the 33-year-old woman they believe had been driving the car at the time of the crash. Officers believe the woman may have been impaired by drugs.
 She was arrested for an alleged DUI.
 Kitchens said the woman also had a suspended driver's license, and a warrant had been issued for her arrest in Meade County.
 Kitchens said the primary damage to the house was to the front porch.
