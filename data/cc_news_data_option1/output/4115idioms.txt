I have to admit, sometimes "American Horror Story," Ryan Murphy's grisly, campy horror anthology series, is too gory for even me. A love letter to the horror genre in all of its over-the-topness, "American Horror Story" is often indulgent and tends to shock at the expense of plot. That said, it's great fun -- if you can handle all the blood and gore splattering all over the place. Stream it on Netflix.

"At the end of the day then, our team used to meet together to share stories after stories of the existing hunger problems in the city," he said. He added that people who were hungry would run next to their cars identifying them carrying food. "From such gut-wrenching incidents, we saw what hunger was from close quarters."

If you live around East Jefferson Avenue in North Greenwood, chances are Ed Morse has provided part of the soundtrack to your quarantine.
 Ever since the Mississippi Valley State University music professor’s morning lessons went virtual in March, the brass specialist has been blessing neighbors with daily practice routines from his carport.
 “Basically my wife kicked me out of the house,” Morse joked. “She’s a virtual teacher, and my daughter is doing virtual instruction, so I went outside. People will come by, maybe one every couple of days, and just say, ‘Sounds great!’”
 Morse’s musical journey began in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he struggled starting trombone as an undersized fourth grader with an oversized instrument.
 “Trombone’s not the easiest instrument, especially if you’re short, because you can’t reach out and play all the notes,” Morse said. “But I stuck with it, waited for my growth spurt and eventually by high school I could play all the positions.”
 After high school, Morse spent over a decade studying music — first completing his undergraduate work at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, then earning his master’s from Baylor University, and finally receiving a doctorate from the University of Knoxville.
 Morse, 40, never really left campus, teaching at Bethune-Cookman University before taking a tenure-track job at MVSU eight years ago.
 In the classroom, “you never do the same thing on a given day,” Morse said. “You’re constantly on your toes about what’s going to happen next. You might be teaching a beginner one moment, and then the next moment might be helping someone with a master’s degree audition. It is completely unpredictable, and I love it.”
 The pandemic has added yet another twist to his teaching career. Students at MVSU now have the option whether or not to return to campus, so Morse must accommodate both virtual and in-person lessons.
 On campus in the afternoons, Morse teaches from behind a plexiglass booth as a safety precaution.
 Inconveniences aside, quarantine has given Morse an opportunity to pick up another instrument. After mastering the trombone and buying a tuba upon moving to Mississippi, Morse learned to play the trumpet in his free time this summer. The added bonus was connecting with his neighbors, which was the reason he fell in love with Greenwood in the first place.
 “My wife and I are big-city people,” Morse said. “We just fell in love with being here. Everybody felt friendly. My favorite thing is when you walk or drive down the street, everyone waves at you.”
 Morse, a trombone player in the Jackson Symphony in Tennessee since 2009, also offers one-on-one instruction to section leaders of the marching band. The group is scheduled to perform at MVSU’s virtual homecoming event next month.
 “It brings a lot of joy around here,” Morse said of the marching band. “When there’s a parade or something, everyone’s smiling. It’s a really good thing we got going on here.”

Consistent awareness of your thought processes will make you more easily recognize which route you normally take and allow you to be more mindful of choosing the compassionate versus empathic route with patients. Buddhist meditation for millennia have focused more on compassion than empathy, preferring to provide unrequited love to all beings rather than overwhelm their emotions with the burden of one single person’s problems. This may be another way to work on developing the skills of compassion. Lastly, continue to take action and find ways to be more compassionate for your patients rather than empathetic. We must be confident and articulate in our decisions with patients and have them realize the long-term benefit of the suggested treatment plan. Patients pay hundreds of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for all sorts of cosmetic plastic surgery augmentations to endure pain, swelling, and the risks of deformation in the short-term to achieve their desired physical appearance in the long run. We need to push for this same time of long-term thinking in all other aspects of health care.

The analogy I use is that when a new day begins and that first ball is on the tee and we're ready to go, and you know the possibilities are infinite as to what we could see. I look at it as weather. We're on a gorgeous beach and the waves are starting to roll in… some of the waves are big, some of the waves are small and they move in different directions and they have different behaviours. And it's time to go out on a surfboard as you and me and we're bringing the enjoyment to the people on the beach who are watching. It's time to get on the surfboard and ride those waves – some of them might crush you, some of them might just be little bumps and then some of them might be glorious where you get on top of that wave and everyone who is watching just looks and marvels at the beauty of it. You can never predict how it will change or what will happen, but you know it will. You and I get romantic about it, don't we? You only get 17 of them each year and that's what I tell our staff on NFL RedZone. 'Guys, I know it's five in the morning when the alarm clock goes off and I know people are tired but we only get 17 of these. And in the middle of June or July or whenever in the deep offseason, you're going to be wishing for just one of these Sundays.' When you get them for five months in a row, it's just something to savour.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Monday allowed the state's mask mandate to stand, rejecting an attempt by the Republican-controlled Legislature and a conservative law firm to overturn it, even as coronavirus cases spiked and the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 hit a new high.
 The judge noted in his ruling that lawmakers could vote to overturn Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' order, but haven't so far. Evers sent Republican legislative leaders a letter hours after the ruling asking them to drop the lawsuit and "work together on our state's greatest challenges."
 Noting a spike in cases, and the opening of a field hospital to provide additional capacity for coronavirus patients, Evers urged Republicans to "start taking this seriously."
 Republican legislative leaders did not immediately return messages seeking comment. The Legislature filed a brief in support of the lawsuit. Also Monday, a Republican-led legislative committee took the first steps to overturn another order Evers issued last week setting capacity limits for business.
 The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, which filed suit against the mask mandate, will appeal, said the group's president Rick Esenberg. He did not say if they would attempt to skip the state appeals court by asking the conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case. Esenberg called the issue a "critical constitutional matter."
 The lawsuit argued that Evers overstepped his authority by issuing multiple emergency orders to curb the coronavirus pandemic. It also said masks are ineffective since Wisconsin's infection numbers have continued to rise since Evers' mandate was imposed. Evers defended the mask order, saying it was within his power to impose the requirement and that he followed the recommendations of public health experts.
 St. Croix County Circuit Judge R. Michael Waterman said in his ruling that nothing prevents a governor from issuing multiple emergency declarations "when the emergency conditions continue to exist."
 "And, if the Legislature is unconvinced that a state of emergency does exist, the Legislature has the ultimate power to terminate it," the judge said.
 Evers called the ruling a victory in the fight against COVID-19.
 "We will continue doing everything we can to prevent the spread of this virus," he said. "We ask Wisconsinites to please stay home as much as possible, limit travel and going to public gatherings, and wear a mask whenever out and about."
 The judge also noted that overturning the mask mandate would "affect every person in Wisconsin by a judicial act that usurps the governor's power to declare a state of emergency and the Legislature's power to end one."
 Evers first declared a public health emergency in March and renewed it in July after the Legislature declined to extend it. The July order mandated the wearing of masks starting in August for anyone aged 5 and up in all enclosed spaces except at home. He issued another order in September that extended the mask mandate until Nov. 21. Violators could be subject to a $200 fine.
 Wisconsin is among the nation's worst COVID-19 hot spots, with more than 152,000 positive cases as of Monday. The seven-day average of new confirmed cases reached a record high of 2,547, up from 2,395 a week ago, the state Department of Health Services said. Medical experts have attributed Wisconsin's spike to colleges and K-12 schools reopening and general fatigue with virus restrictions.
 The number of people hospitalized due to COVID-19 in Wisconsin also hit a record high on Monday at 950, according to the Wisconsin Hospital Association. The previous high was 907 set just four days earlier. Monday's total was up by 61 from the day before and 168 over the past seven days.
 Republican legislators in May succeeded in getting the conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court to strike down Evers' virus-related stay-at-home order. The high court ruled that the Evers administration had overstepped its authority when it extended the order without consulting lawmakers.
 Republican legislators in other states have skirmished repeatedly with Democratic governors over their powers during the pandemic. In neighboring Michigan, the conservative-majority state Supreme Court ruled that the law underpinning Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's response to the pandemic was unconstitutional.

In 1942, in Newark, New Jersey, a pretty, petite Black girl named Dolores Hill tested into an honors English class. A high school sophomore, an excellent dancer, and an avid reader, Dolores felt uncomfortable in the course. Her new classmates, who had been on the same college preparatory track for at least a year were all white, knew each other, and lived in the same, if not similar neighborhoods in what was then a thriving Newark. Dolores had different friends, (Black ones), lived in a different neighborhood, (a Black neighborhood), and had not considered college in light of the work opportunities made recently available to African Americans and women by the war effort. The teacher, an exacting woman, seemed to Dolores then very, very old. Now ninety-three, Dolores who is my grandmother, can't recall the teacher's name, but in retrospect she doesn't think the instructor was actually a day over thirty. However, the thing that nearly eighty years of life hasn't been able to wipe from my grandmother's memory is just how hostile that woman was to having a single Black student in her advanced class.

McKinney ISD officials announced that the district received a rating of “Superior” under Texas’ Schools FIRST financial accountability rating system.
 The Superior rating is the state’s highest mark, demonstrating the quality of MISD’s financial management and reporting system. This is the 18th consecutive year that the district has earned the highest possible FIRST rating.
 In fact, only two points separated MISD’s total of 98 and a perfect score. While the structure for calculating scores can be complex, the state essentially awarded fewer points to MISD for using an accelerated 20-year debt payment structure—which provides substantial interest savings in the long term—rather than a 30+ year approach to debt payment structure.

EFL chief Rick Parry (L) has backed the plans. © Reuters
 But looks can be deceiving, and even a cursory glance at the deeper caveats of the project reveal a self-serving plan which is merely masquerading as a desperately-needed lifeline for the lower reaches of the English football pyramid.
 The details of the proposal - which came on the heels of Friday's announcement that fans will have to pay an extortionate £14.95 pay-per-view fee for every game they want to watch in October that has not been selected for broadcast, after Premier League clubs spent £1.3 billion in a transfer market - are a reminder of the greed and cynicism that reign supreme at the top of the English game.
 Currently, every Premier League club has one vote when it comes to deciding policy, with a majority of 14 votes needed for a change to pass.
 United and Liverpool are proposing that be scrapped.
 Instead, they and seven other clubs - the remainder of the so-called 'Big Six' of Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur, plus Everton, Southampton and West Ham United - would hold all the voting power, with a majority of six from those nine required.
 The Premier League would also be reduced from 20 clubs to 18 - but the Championship, League One and League Two would remain at 24 apiece, so two clubs would lose their EFL status - while the Carabao Cup and Community Shield would be binned.
 For all the good that would come to the EFL under Project Big Picture, it would come at far too high a price, and the fingerprints of Liverpool and United's US owners can be found all over this opportunistic attempt to seize power.
 The granting of special status to the 'Big Six' to reinforce their stranglehold over the top flight is reminiscent of the "locked-in" model that pervades American sports leagues.
 Big teams aren't at risk of relegation to a lower tier, while those below can't rise through the ranks to challenge those at the top - everyone knows their place.
 Under the proposals, the 'Big Six' would even have the power to veto potential takeovers, allowing them to prevent wealthy new owners from transforming the fortunes of other clubs, ironically like Sheikh Mansour did at Manchester City. Under the new plans, City could block 'upstarts' such as themselves from ever challenging at the top table.

Interestingly, out of the three generations of Oxenberg women who had varying levels of encounters with NXIVM, it was the youngest one who didn't question the organization's authority. In NXIVM, if someone challenged a statement, they were called "defiant" or otherwise made to feel like they were the one with the "issue" -- that groupthink was the "right" way to go. Although both Princess Elizabeth and Catherine Oxenberg both came from the schools of thought that "you don't push back," it was India Oxenberg who became the most concerned with the idea that she would be "on the outs" and publicly shamed within the community -- so much so that she says now that there were gut feelings she ignored in order to continue down NXIVM's path.

Apunto a la calidad del producto y cada vez me pongo más estricta y busco mejor materia prima. También le esquivo un poquito a toda esa cosa de gelatina, a esas terminaciones perfectas. Yo voy más a lo recién hecho, a que sea tentador, les doy mucha importancia a las texturas. Y por último, porque es tendencia y también por curiosidad, estoy incursionando cada vez más en lo saludable, lo vegano, lo sin TACC. Experimento con diferentes harinas, azúcares, investigo, pero no les digo "no" a los ingredientes de siempre. Apelo al equilibrio y trato de que las cosas tengan cada vez menos azúcar y más productos sanos.

"Indoctrination is a slow drip," says Catherine Oxenberg. "One of the initial classes, I'll give you an example, is about honesty, so they'll say, 'When is the higher value to tell the truth or to withhold the truth?' They use the example of if you were hiding a Jew in your basement during World War II and Nazis came to your door and said, 'Are you harboring anybody?' and you said no, did you do the right thing by withholding the truth? That is a plausible argument -- but then the end result of years of line-bending is [that] you take it that Keith Raniere is the highest value, therefore what will you do to protect the truth and protect the leader? They take something initially that makes sense in your sane value structure and they pull you into a bubble of belief that is so crazy."

Governments' unprecedented stimulus responses to the pandemic will also ratchet up the sum of global debt. National debt in advanced economies is poised to reach 125% of GDP by the end of next year, according to the Tuesday report. Governments should stay more focused on reviving their economies than handling debt piles, the IMF added, as a healthy recovery can aid the deficit down the road.

When I was the same age as Claudia is now, I sold a novel inspired by my experiences growing up in Los Angeles among the progeny of Hollywood’s power players. It started out as a darkly comedic book about a 12-year-old girl struggling with body image, mental health issues, family conflict, and social alienation. By the time it was published, in the summer of 2009, it had morphed into a YA novel about a 16-year-old girl complete with the mandatory Best Friend, Bitchy Popular Girls, Seductive but Disappointing Love Interest, and even, though this I included reluctantly, The One Who Has Been There All Along. I took great pains to fictionalize the parents and ensure that none of the characters were too deeply flawed.

Many conifer forests in the western United States contain too many trees, packed too closely together. This crowding is a result of past management practices that suppressed wildfires and prioritized timber harvesting. In recent years, climate warming, accumulation of dead wood on the forest floor and a buildup of small trees - which serve as "ladder fuels," moving fire from the forest floor up into the canopy - have led to hotter, larger wildfires.

Interestingly, out of the three generations of Oxenberg women who had varying levels of encounters with NXIVM, it was the youngest one who didn't question the organization's authority. In NXIVM, if someone challenged a statement, they were called "defiant" or otherwise made to feel like they were the one with the "issue" \-- that groupthink was the "right" way to go. Although both Princess Elizabeth and Catherine Oxenberg both came from the schools of thought that "you don't push back," it was India Oxenberg who became the most concerned with the idea that she would be "on the outs" and publicly shamed within the community -- so much so that she says now that there were gut feelings she ignored in order to continue down NXIVM's path.

They have made the playoffs in every IPL season they have played thus far.Barring the top three of Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis and Ambati Rayudu the other batsmen haven't arrived at the scene and the fragility of the middle order has cost CSK dear on many occasions.The bowlers have done comparatively better than the batsman but death bowling still remains a concern.",
