Many in China chafe at Trump’s effort to blame them for the pandemic as both unfair and factually wrong. They see China, with its draconian isolation of Wuhan province and other hot spots, as a model for how to contain and conquer the disease. Many also see China as having reached out to help other countries as its own crisis has abated.
 There’s a narrative widely accepted within China that the country has been able to bring the virus under control and “that China is — if not the savior of the world — at least sort of doing more than its fair share to help the rest of the world,” said David Bachman, a China specialist at the University of Washington in Seattle.
 And public resentment in both countries is likely to be intensified by the rising economic cost of the pandemic.
 Both economics are expected to see their sharpest drops in decades, with millions of people thrown out of work, businesses crippled or destroyed, and political leaders facing a unique crisis in which conventional stimulus and other time-honored economic policies seem ineffective.
 As the economic pain spreads, analysts say it will probably make compromise more difficult even if deescalation would benefit both sides.
 “I don’t think there’s any way in hell things get better from here,” Blanchette said. “An increasingly authoritarian China, mixed with a global growth downturn, mixed with a domestic recession, mixed with a populist president, mixed with an election year, equals an increasingly factious discourse on China.”
 In the months ahead, China’s economy is expected to suffer its slowest growth in more than 40 years, and could even turn negative for the first time since the mid-1970s.
 That could threaten political stability if the Communist Party fails to make good on its compact with the masses to keep improving their economic well- being in exchange for compliance with an authoritarian and often repressive system.
 But there are signs that China’s economy may fare better than many in the West are projecting. Factories have largely resumed operations, with electric power usage returning to 95% of what it was this time a year ago, said Nicholas Lardy, a China economy expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 Trade will undoubtedly suffer with slumping demand from recessions in Europe and America, but Chinese exports exert only half the weight they did on the U.S. economy in the 2008 financial crisis. What’s more, Beijing hasn’t felt the need to spur growth with massive credit or provide anything close to the $2-trillion relief package that the U.S. passed two weeks ago.
 If the Chinese thought they were heading for a major downturn, Lardy said, Beijing would have injected a lot more stimulus than it has. “I think that’s qualitatively probably the single most important indicator. It’s the dog that didn’t bark.”
 For Trump, the antagonism with China has centered on trade. He has led a tit- for-tat tariff war with China, eroding what for many years had been seen as the ballast in the relationship.
 In January, there was a glimmer of hope that tensions might ease: The two sides struck a large trade deal in which the Chinese promised to buy billions of dollars more in American farm products and other goods.
 But “the trade deal signed in January is already dead in the water,” said Bachman. “There’s no possible way that the targets now are going to be met. And so that’s going to be a source of dissatisfaction on the U.S. side.”
 What’s more, the coronavirus pandemic exposed America’s heavy dependence on China for critical medical supplies and drugs, as well as many other manufactured products.
 The outbreak fractured supply chains now dominated by China, prompting more U.S. firms to make plans to relocate operations and rearrange global business relationships.
 The disruptions came at a time when corporate America was already growing disillusioned with the old relationship.
 Beijing’s persistent refusal to prevent its companies from appropriating the intellectual property and know-how of U.S. firms was high on a lengthening list of complaints.
 Whatever the outcome of the coronavirus crisis, it’s almost certain to accelerate long-term changes in the economic relationship between the two countries.
 The pandemic “has demonstrated the impossibility of the U.S. and China being coupled closely together,” said Clyde Prestowitz, a former top trade negotiator in the Reagan administration. “The notion that free trade and globalization are going to tame China and make it more semocratic, etc., I think this has shown that’s bull.”
 Deborah Seligsohn, a former economic officer and later science and health counselor for the U.S. State Department in China, lamented the fact that Trump officials had ordered most of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff out of China.
 But even so, she said, there’s been enough goodwill among working-level officials in both countries that the Chinese CDC contacted the American CDC in early January about the coronavirus outbreak.
 The warnings were alarming enough and extensive enough that the U.S. could have responded more effectively and quickly, she said.
 “The more we can come up with ways to work together with goodwill in the public health crisis, the more we will be able to move forward and, in a way, to rebuild the global economy,” said Seligsohn, who teaches at Villanova University.
 “We know from 1997 [the Asian financial crisis] and from 2008 that the economy will bounce back better if we are ensuring that we are all flourishing.
 “I think there’s an opportunity right now to tone down the rhetoric, to think about the global health crisis as one of cooperation, and to create the basis when we all try to get back to business.”

The riches had been dug up, dried out. The streams bore no gold. The soil bore no crops. Instead, they found a far duller prize locked within the hills - coal.

NEW YORK (AP) —
 A federal judge in New York on Tuesday denied R&B singer R. Kelly's request for release from jail in Chicago because he was concerned he could contract the coronavirus while behind bars.
 “The defendant is currently in custody because of the risks that he will flee or attempt to obstruct, threaten or intimidate prospective witnesses,” U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly of Brooklyn wrote in her denial. "The defendant has not explained how those risks have changed.”
 The 53-year-old Kelly has been in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago since he was indicted on federal child pornography, obstruction of justice and racketeering charges.
 Three staff members at the federal lockup have tested positive for the virus, but no inmates have been reported with infections. Cases have been reported at Cook County Jail in Chicago and other jails and prisons around the country. Kelly's attorneys filed a motion in late March arguing that people in such facilities are at particular risk of contracting the virus.
 Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said the Chicago lockup and other federal facilities have taken steps to prevent the virus from spreading. Further, they wrote that a “generalized risk” that an inmate could contract the virus doesn't justify their release.
 Kelly has denied ever abusing anyone and has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. He faces several dozen counts of state and federal sexual misconduct charges in Illinois, Minnesota and New York, from sexual assault to heading a racketeering scheme aimed at supplying Kelly with girls.

 “The snow-sports community is attacking this with such intensity,” said Jon Schaefer, the founder of the program. “We all know healthcare workers and you’re like, ‘Oh, man, I want to do something.’”

So this is one big worry on the level of individual countries and then even bigger worries what's happening on the international level because so far, we have seen a really disastrous lack of leadership in the world, like there is no adults in the room. There is no global plan of how to tackle the health emergency or the economic crisis. And we are - we haven't seen the worst of it yet. I think the worst would come when the epidemic and the economic crisis hits developing countries in Central and South America, in Africa and the Middle East. The U.S. can have a rescue package of $2 trillion, but Ecuador or Egypt or Bangladesh can't. So the question is, when and if we will see a global plan, how to tackle both the epidemic and the resulting economic crisis.

Airbnb’s new funding points to some of the tactical measures startups are taking as they navigate the difficult period. In the last month, numerous startups have laid off or furloughed staff, and cut spending and expansion plans in moves that signal the end of a long-running boom for the industry. Well-funded travel startups, including Sonder, Lyric and TripActions, have been hit especially hard.
 Airbnb, too, enacted a hiring freeze, slashed its $800 million marketing budget and cut the pay of its top executives last month. The company raised more money even though it has $3 billion in cash on its balance sheet and access to a $1 billion line of credit.
 A company spokesman declined to comment on what the new funding meant for an IPO. Airbnb is under pressure to go public before some of its early employees’ shares begin to expire later this year.
 The difficulties Airbnb is facing have become increasingly apparent over the past few weeks. The company has contended with frustrated customers who demanded refunds for canceled trips, while also trying to find ways to support its “hosts,” the people who rent their homes on its site.
 Many of its hosts have had their bookings drop to zero over the past few months. The financial struggles of short-term-rental operators have manifested themselves in online petitions and threats of lawsuits against the company.
 On March 30, Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s chief executive, held a video call with the company’s hosts and said the past few weeks had been a “wake-up call.” He announced a $250 million fund to compensate hosts for a portion of their booking cancellations, as well as a $10 million pool of grant money for its “Superhosts,” paid for by Airbnb’s founders and employees.

Dear Dave,   My husband runs a small business that has never done very well. We have three kids, and I make $55,000 annually in my job. Part of what I make has been going into the business for over a year to help keep it afloat, and we don't have a lot of money in savings. What do you think we should do?   Stephanie
 Dear Stephanie,   If you're putting other money into a business account, that's a pretty good sign you're not making money in the business. You and your husband need to sit down together and do a household budget and a profit and loss statement on the business. You've got to get on the same page financially.   Put all his business expenses on the profit and loss statement in detail, and write out what it would take for him to break even each month. But honestly, with everything that's been going on with your finances, if he's not at least breaking even at this point, then it's time for him to do something else for a living full-time.   I'm an entrepreneur and business owner. Trust me, I totally understand the allure and excitement that goes with running your own business. But your own household and its immediate financial responsibilities come first. The only money that should go into the business account is income the business creates.   Dave
 No free passes   Dear Dave,   I own a small business, and recently a relative asked for a job with the company. I hate to say this, but I've got reservations about hiring her. She's basically a good kid, but not the most reliable person in the world. Do you have any advice on how to handle a situation like this?   Bill
 Dear Bill,   As an entrepreneur, you have the right and responsibility to do what's best for your company. That means you shouldn't hire anyone who isn't a good fit - even a relative.   If a relative is qualified, and the kind of person who understands they'll have to bring it every single day, performing at a level equal to or above your other team members, that can be a special and rewarding thing. But if that relative is the kind of person who expects special treatment or is a problem child, that kind of situation can be a nightmare for you, your company and the whole family.   Would you hire this person because they'd make a good team member? Would you hire this person if they weren't part of the family? If the answer to either of these questions is no, don't hire them. It's as simple as that.   The bottom line is you have to do what's best for your business, your immediate family, and your team.   Dave

"While we have discussed the idea of staging games at one location as one potential option, we have not settled on that option or developed a detailed plan."
   
 Baseball officials intend to study which options may be viable.
   
 "While we continue to interact regularly with governmental and public health officials, we have not sought or received approval of any plan from federal, state and local officials, or the players' association," MLB said. "We are not ready at this time to endorse any particular format for staging games in light of the rapidly changing public health situation caused by the coronavirus."
   
 Half of the MLB clubs hold spring training in Arizona, the other half in Florida.
   
 Arizona's advantage is 10 spring training ballparks plus the Arizona Diamondbacks' Chase Field all within about 50 miles. The Indians' spring training facility and ballpark are in Goodyear, just 20 miles from Phoenix.
   
 Florida's spring training ballparks are spread out by as much as 220 miles.
   
 "It allows for immediacy of a schedule, where you might be able to begin it and televise it, provide Major League Baseball to America," said Scott Boras, baseball's most prominent agent. "I think players are willing to do what's necessary because I think they understand the importance of baseball for their own livelihoods and for the interest of our country and providing a necessary product that gives all the people that are isolated enjoyment."
   
 "It gives them a sense of a return to some normalcy," Boras added. "You talk to a psychologist about it and they say it's really good for a culture to have sport and to have a focus like that, where for a few hours a day they can take their minds off the difficult reality of the virus."
   
 Baseball's season had been set to start March 26 but spring training was halted on March 12. After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended restricting events of more than 50 people for eight weeks, MLB said it would not open until mid-May at the earliest.
   
 Texas Rangers president of baseball operations Jon Daniels said MLB is examining different options and he didn't want to speculate.
   
 "But, obviously, we'd all love to find a way to play, provided we could do safely, and that would be the priority," he said.
   
 The players' association would want to survey its members to determine whether they would support such a plan, one of the people said.
   
 "You're going to be largely separated from your families and you're going to have to function in a very contained way. It's not a normal life, this idea," Boras said. "You're going to have an identified group of people. You're going to have a constantly tested group of people. And you're going to have a very limited access of those people to the outside world so that you can assure a very uncontaminated league, if you will, to produce a product that is inspirational to our country."
   
 Chase Field, with artificial turf and a retractable roof, could be the site of daily tripleheaders, Boras said.
   
 MLB and the union reached a deal March 26 to advance $170 million in salary to players for the first 60 days of the season. As part of the deal, players would get only prorated portions of their salaries if the regular season is cut from its usual 162 games and would receive no additional salary if the season is scrapped.
   
 Both sides have agreed to attempt to play as full a season as is possible, and this plan would enable the season to start while waiting for health and government officials to determine whether it is safe to resume play in regular-season ballparks, with the travel that would entail.

As Jails And Prisons Reduce Populations, Advocates Call On ICE To Do The Same : NPR

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Cam Newton says he feels like a “fish out of a water” being a free agent for the first time in his nine-year NFL career.Newton said during a conversation with Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul on Instagram Live on Monday that being released by the Carolina Panthers has left him with a chip on his shoulder that has “turned into family-size real quick.”Newton didn’t give any indication where he might be interested in signing.The 2015 league MVP played in only two games last season and is coming off surgery for a Lisfranc fracture in his foot. He also had surgery in the 2019 offseason for a partially torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder.Because players are not allowed at NFL facilities due to the coronavirus pandemic, Newton has not been able to visit any potential suitors and work out for teams to prove he’s healthy.“It’s so much possibility for me right now, but the fact that this corona situation has hit, I’m not a person to blame or do any of that things,” Newton said. “But at the same time, I think I have been affected in a lot of ways, and it’s just (unfortunate). But at the end of the day, man, I’m going to let the ball play how it play and go from there.”The Panthers replaced Newton with free agent Teddy Bridgewater.General manager Marty Hurney said Monday on a conference call with reporters that releasing Newton was an extremely difficult decision. It was one of several moves Carolina made this offseason in an effort to remake the roster.“You have to make very difficult decisions every year,” Hurney said. “This was probably one of the most difficult. I drafted Cam. We all know everything he’s brought to the organization both on and off the field, so it was extremely difficult.”As for the 30-year-old Newton, he’s still looking for a new home.“I’ve never not known anything other than the Carolina Panthers, and now it’s like I want God to direct my path and put me in a position where I can thrive and be myself,” Newton said.

STEIN: Yes. So the CDC says this new system will finally get a handle on just how bad things are around the country, you know, by gathering the results of the testing that's finally ramping up, you know, tallying how many people are getting and dying COVID-19 and to spot early warning signs, like, you know, surges of sick people showing up at their doctors, ERs getting overwhelmed to help do things, like figure out where to rush more ventilators and clamp down harder to stop the virus and hopefully really know whether all those drastic steps we're taking might be working. Here's Lynnette Brammer again from the CDC.

The other thing I do when I talk with reporters is to be straight. I try not to deceive them or to be defensive, because those are precisely the ways most people get themselves into trouble with the press. Instead, when a reporter asks me a tough question, I try to frame a positive answer, even if that means shifting the ground. For example, if someone asks me what negative effects the world’s tallest building might have on the West Side, I turn the tables and talk about how New Yorkers deserve the world’s tallest building, and what a boost it will give the city to have it again. When a reporter asks why I build only for the rich, I note that the rich aren’t the only ones who benefit from my buildings. I explain that I put thousands of people to work who might otherwise be collecting unemployment, and that I add to the city’s tax base every time I build a new project. I also point out that buildings like Trump Tower have helped spark New York’s renaissance.

Many of us are trying to adjust to being either isolated from others or with more people and pets than normal. Here are some pet tips to help you get by.
 [BestReviews] The best pet tracker »
 Animals generally like routine, so keep routines intact to maintain the harmony in your home. If you are permitted to walk your dog, observe social distancing protocols so everyone safe. In your home or yard, play games with your dog, like fetch or hide and seek, and get your cat moving with toys that make him or her chase something across the floor or swat at something in the air.
 You can also use this time to train your dog. This bonding time will improve your relationship and help tire your dog out too. Get your kids to help with the training and break those treats into small pieces, so they last longer. If you are feeling anxious or depressed, meditate with your pets. All you have to do is sit and stroke them, and you will almost instantly feel the benefits of this human-animal connection.
 This also might be a good time to adopt or foster a pet. In addition to providing a permanent or temporary home for a pet during this crisis, fostering or adopting a pet can be a great way to bring some furry companionship to your home during this isolation period. The shelter likely will cover pet food and medical expenses, so it won't cost you anything.
 Consider it and stay well.
 Dear Cathy,
 I am writing about your recent column on feral cats and how some people wanted them removed from their neighborhoods or killed. Many years ago, on Long Beach Island in New Jersey, there was a group of people that thought the same thing. So, all the feral cats were trapped and removed from their neighborhoods. And guess what? A year later, these same people were complaining about the number of rats and mice that were now running loose and multiplying in their neighborhoods with nothing around to reduce their numbers.

"Mayors have had to have sessions explaining that the doors are not open for the churches to gather," said Jesse Rincones, Executive Director of Convención Bautista Hispana de Texas — a collection of over 1,100 Hispanic Baptist congregations in Texas.
 Like other clergies still working to serve their congregations, the organization is trying to preserve a sense of community amid a loss of routine, ritual and, at times, a sense of peace. Rincones, a pastor of 18 years, has been helping other churches' leaders move their services online.
 The technology aspect has been easier on the United Hebrew Congregation in St. Louis, says Rabbi Brigitte Rosenberg. UHC, which serves over 900 families, already had its livestreaming services set up for the homebound and college students, the rabbi said. Still, it's a different experience.
 "I know for many congregants it has taken some getting used to not being together and just sitting in their homes and listening and feeling like they're watching as opposed to participating," she said.
 The virtual transition will be particularly challenging during the Jewish holiday of Passover, which begins on Wednesday. The St. Louis synagogue is encouraging its congregants to allow for some flexibility with normally strict traditions. This year, the United Hebrew Congregation will be hosting its Passover Seder online.
 "Whereas we may not be utilizing technology on a normal Passover, we are going to be using it this time so that we can connect," Rosenberg said.
 In New York City, a hotbed in the outbreak, the pandemic has hit close to home, said Imam Suhaib Webb, a scholar in residence at New York University's Islamic Center. One of his colleague's mother-in-law died this past week.

There has been a surge of support for efforts like a GoFundMe Campaign to provide food and water for tribal elders, and for DIG DEEP to install more water systems.
 The Navajo Nation also lacks enough health care workers, hospital beds and other equipment needed to address the crisis. Under normal circumstances, there are about 400 hospital beds for 170,000 people. So many patients have been flown to hospitals in border towns. Council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty says the Indian Health Service was lacking resources before the virus.
 "We know it's not adequate to just meet our basic needs. And so now as this pandemic moves forward across the world but on Navajo Nation we're also seeing those gaps in the immediate response," Crotty says.
 The number of coronavirus cases on the Navajo Nation is multiplying rapidly. As of April 3, there are 241 people with the virus and eight confirmed deaths. The CDC says Native Americans are some of the most vulnerable to the coronavirus because of economic, geographic, and health conditions.
 In 2009, American Indians and Alaska Natives died from H1N1 flu at four times the rates of all other racial and ethnic groups combined, according to a study by the National Institutes of Health.

Behind the wheel of his tan Ford Edge, Jay Smith greets passengers with a smile that's hidden behind a bandana wrapped around his face.
   
 A platinum-level Uber driver, Smith, 52, of North Olmsted, has been chauffeuring Cleveland-area residents full-time to their destinations since August.
   
 Now, with mandatory stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19, fewer people are requesting Uber rides, leaving drivers like him to question how much they'll make on their next paycheck.
   
 Although Gov. Mike DeWine declared Uber, Lyft and other driving services "essential," passengers are encouraged -- both by the Uber app and state governments -- to only call a ride if absolutely necessary.
   
 "It's dramatically changed it," Smith said while driving through the vacant streets of Bay Village, west of Cleveland. "I'm not going out continuously anymore."
   
 With nearly every aspect of life shut down -- bars, restaurants, sporting events and even gatherings of 10 or more -- Smith is primarily driving passengers to grocery stores or other residences.
   
 He said he applied to drive for Uber Eats in anticipation of stay-at-home orders increasing as a way to make up for the lost wages.
   
 After being laid off from two companies, Smith said he signed up for Uber driving once his savings were no longer enough to cover the bills.
   
 "My wife is carrying the burden," he said. "I'm treading water just to pay some bills that our household had."
   
 Although fewer passengers impacts Smith's wages, the time it takes him to disinfect the car after he drops someone off leaves him less time to accept other rides in the area, degrading his "acceptance rate" and consequently his Uber rating, he said.
   
 "What's really impacted it is that after I'm done, I find a spot to disinfect the area where they're sitting," Smith said.
   
 Harry Hartfield, spokesman for Uber, said the company will provide financial support to drivers who are required to self-quarantine for up to 14 days. The amount will vary depending on a driver's average daily earnings over the last six months.
   
 "In these difficult times, their well-being is at the top of our minds, and we have a dedicated team working around the clock to support them the very best we can," Hartfield said in an email.
   
 Although Uber will compensate drivers, Smith said it's unclear how much compensation he will earn, and whether that will be enough to get him through the pandemic.
   
 "There lies the unknown," he said.
   
 Although it's daunting when he picks up passengers wearing masks because he's unsure whether they are infected with COVID-19, he said his own bandana, disinfectants and the fresh air ease his anxiety.
   
 As he puts his car in park, Smith said he is hopeful that Uber will remain an "essential service" because someone's got to pay the bills.
