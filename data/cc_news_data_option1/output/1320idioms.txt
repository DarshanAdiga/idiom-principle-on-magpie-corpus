Darius Slay is welcoming the challenge of being the big ticket for the Philadelphia Eagles secondary. It can be an unforgiving market when players don't live up to their massive contract, as others in the past can attest, and Slay landed a three-year, $50 million that includes $30 million in guaranteed money \-- putting him in a pressure-packed situation with his new club. Considering the Eagles also gave up a third- and fifth-round pick in 2020 for the right to award Slay such a deal, the expectation is he'll hit the ground running and improve upon what many view as a 2019 downturn.
 For his part, however, he doesn't believe he took a step back whatsoever last season. Instead, the 29-year-old views it in entirely the inverse, noting his play was good enough to land him a third consecutive Pro Bowl nod.
 "I had a great year, in my opinion," Slay said, via NFL.com. "I think I played freaking fantastic."
 Those who disagree point at regression following a career-best 2017 season that saw him reel in eight interceptions and 26 pass breakups, noting the decrease to three INTs in 2018 and only two in 2019. He's looking to either continue his dominant ways, or to improve upon them -- depending upon your view of his recent production -- when he touches down in Philadelphia. And he wants it to be known he's not shying away from shadowing any team's No. 1 wide receiver on any given week.
 If anything, he's demanding the Eagles keep the pressure for him to perform turned all the way up.

Clubs will be more careful now. Transfer fees are going to come down. Clubs will stop offering big wages and long-term contracts of five or six years.
 Some of them won’t even be able to shift the players they don’t want any more.
 When the next TV deal comes up surely these clubs are not going to expect Sky and BT to pay big money again? There’s no football on. They won’t risk that happening again.
 Before all this started I would have said in a couple of years you would see loads of players on £500,000 or £600,000 a week.
 Not any more.
 The players used to hold all the aces and they would basically get what they want in most deals.

Once you have a script locked, you have graphics being made and editors building out other sequences on the timeline.

Our governor's "shelter in place" order has changed the way we live. Rather than meeting people at church or in the coffee shop, I've been meeting people on Zoom. Pastoral visitation has not happened in people's homes but on our phones. I and others have been calling our church family, checking on their health and seeing if they need groceries or meds. Many of these members are older and, to a person, they are doing remarkably well. They are a resilient bunch.      It turns out that many of our older members were spending most of their time at home, even before the governor's order. The pandemic has not affected them in the same way it affects the soccer mom, who puts 25,000 miles a year on her van, or the retired couple who eat out five nights a week.      While our church family is doing well, the question on their minds, and their friends' and neighbors' minds, is: How long will this last? They want to know what's coming next and when things are going to return to normal.      All of us have a sort of inner gravity that constantly pulls us back toward normal, even when normal is not healthy. When will things be normal again? Our routines, which always have suffered interruptions, have now been turned on their heads. Everything has changed.      The pandemic has highlighted the limits of our ability to control the future. When we are in our usual routines, we assume we know what is coming next. Now, we are painfully aware that we don't. When normalcy finally returns, that awareness is likely to dissolve like a mist.      However, when the awareness of our limits dissolves, the limits themselves remain. As long as our routines are in full swing and our rhythms uninterrupted, we can overlook those limits. We may even congratulate ourselves that our crystal ball readings have been spot-on. Nevertheless, human beings are not, and never have been, good at controlling the future.      When I was a schoolboy, life suddenly changed in my household. My dad, who had been drinking and hanging out with a rowdy crowd, gave up alcohol. Previously, he was gone most evenings playing softball, bowling or playing cards and, always, drinking. Now he was playing catch with my brother and me. We were going fishing together. We even went camping.      The future must have seemed brighter to my mother. It certainly seemed more orderly. We got into a routine of sorts. The uncertainty of the past was gradually replaced by confidence in the future.      It was short-lived. Even at that time, unperceived by my parents, a white blood cell in my brother Kevin's body was damaged and began growing and dividing uncontrollably. He had leukemia.      I don't know how long this went on before my parents noticed something was amiss. For a while, life continued normally. Kevin seemed to have everything going for him. He was a gifted athlete, popular at school, and was loved by kids and adults alike. Then the sky came crashing in.      There was no warning that life was about to change. But that's the way it is. The future only occasionally issues warnings. Usually, it is stubbornly silent. Our confidence concerning the future is built on shaky ground. Even now, some reader's (or the writer's) cells may be dividing uncontrollably, and there is no indication of what is coming.      If COVID-19 helps us come to terms with this fundamental uncertainty, we will have wrestled some good out of a bad situation. If we are able to replace a wispy confidence in the future by a secure confidence in God, we will stand on firmer ground. Oswald Chambers confessed, "Faith doesn't always know where it is being led," then added, "… but it does love and know the one that's leading."      It is ironic. When our routines are in place and we think we have everything in hand, our confidence in the future is set to betray us. But when our routines have been upended and we're not sure what's coming next, our confidence in God can enable us to face the future with courage and peace.

Coronavirus: Back from Tenerife lockdown - in the nick of time

Melbourne Storm football boss Frank Ponissi has revealed a proposal to organise teams in conferences at four different locations as the NRL scrambles to find ways to get back on the field.
 But Ponissi admits he is not getting his hopes up over the idea.
 South Sydney coach Wayne Bennett reportedly pitched an initial idea to organise teams in two conferences to Project Apollo, the NRL's innovation committee charged with finding a way to re-start the competition in the next two months amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 However, Ponissi said the latest development was to divide the 16 teams into four conferences based at Brisbane/Sunshine Coast, north Queensland, NSW's Central Coast and Canberra although he stressed he had not received official word from the NRL.
 "It is four pools of four (teams). (That way) you minimise the amount of people in one particular area which makes it, especially from a health and safety point of view, far more manageable," he told SEN radio.
 And Ponissi believed players would be up for it, even if it meant being away from their families.
 He said their mood had changed dramatically since resisting an initial pitch to house all 16 teams at Gladstone after seeing club employees being stood down and the players' salaries were cut dramatically on Thursday.
 "A couple of weeks ago there was a real resistance (to move away), that was one of the reasons why a lot of people especially players and staff with young families were saying 'no we won't look at that'," Ponissi said.
 "Now it's changed again. People are out of work and salaries have either been cut or stopped completely.
 "You've got to feed your family ... so they will look at anything. The mood has changed dramatically."
 Admittedly Ponissi wasn't holding his breath for the four conference model to be given the green light following government restrictions and border closures due to the pandemic.
 "It will still be a tough ask. I am trying to calm people's expectations at our club," he said.
 "It's a realistic option but let's not get our hopes up.
 "It might be out of our hands. We might be looking at a situation where the government says 'it's just not possible'."
 Still, Ponissi believed any speculation about the game returning sooner rather than later would benefit the players in self isolation.
 "It's a little bit of hope but it is something to cling on. It will help with their individual training for the next few weeks," he said.

English Premier League clubs have unanimously agreed to consult with their players concerning a 30 per cent wage deferral to assist with the payment of non-playing staff during the pandemic.
 It was also acknowledged that the season could not begin in May, with the restart date to be kept under constant review.
 EPL players and clubs have come under fire after some furloughed non-playing staff but not looked at players' wages during the coronavirus crisis.
 British Health secretary Matt Hancock said on Thursday soccer stars should "take a pay cut and play their part."
 EPL shareholders met on Friday and confirmed talks will be held with a view to wage cuts.
 The league also confirmed an immediate advance of STG 125million ($A255 million) to the lower tier EFL and the National League.
 All football in Britain had provisionally been suspended until April 30 because of the outbreak but after Friday's meeting the league's position of a restart date is "under constant review."
 "In the face of substantial and continuing losses for the 2019-20 season since the suspension of matches began, and to protect employment throughout the professional game, Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to consult their players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30 per cent of total annual remuneration," a statement from the Premier League read.
 "This guidance will be kept under constant review as circumstances change. The league will be in regular contact with the PFA and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow between the league, players and club representatives."
 On the subject of the season restarting, the statement said: "It was acknowledged that the Premier League will not resume at the beginning of May - and that the 2019-20 season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so.
 "The restart date is under constant review with all stakeholders, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic develops and we work together through this very challenging time."
 Teams still have nine or 10 games left to play, with Liverpool - the leaders by 25 points - still needing two more wins to clinch its first title since 1990.
 Meanwhile, European soccer's governing body UEFA, in a letter signed by the European Clubs' Association and the European Leagues, has urged members not to abandon their competitions.
 Halting leagues without their approval could see teams blocked from qualifying for the Champions League and Europa League as they are determined based on final positions in domestic standings, UEFA warned earlier on Friday.

If the playoffs don't happen, or if they do and the Sixers are bounced early, it's hard to imagine Brown coming back as the coach next season. Reasonable minds can disagree on the degree of blame he deserves for Philly's relative underachievement. It was GM Elton Brand who traded away -- or let walk away in free agency -- basically all of Philly's shooting (Robert Covington, J.J. Redick, Landry Shamet, Dario Saric, Ersan Ilyasova, Marco Belinelli).
 By most every measurement, Brand over-traded for Tobias Harris, then subsequently overpaid him to stay. He signed Al Horford to a giant contract when the writing was on the wall that he was not a great fit next to Joel Embiid. Brand went all-in on an already flawed team, and in many ways only wound up exacerbating those flaws. Now he's being talked about as a target of Leon Rose's to be the next general manager of the Knicks.
 Meanwhile, Brown could end up taking the fall. It's not to say he's been perfect, and perhaps he's not the right coach to get this team over the hump. Different coaches are right for different parts of every team's process. Mark Jackson got the Warriors within striking distance and Steve Kerr put them over the top.
 Brown had the Sixers within one Kawhi Leonard rim-rolling game-winner from taking the eventual-champion Raptors to overtime in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals last season. But if we're going to credit him with that near success, we have to give him at least some of the blame for a Sixers team this season that currently sits in the No. 6 slot in the Eastern Conference with one of the worst road records in the NBA.

"I love the challenge," Slay recently said in a conference call, via the Associated Press. "I kind of ask for it a lot because the fact that I want the game on me, and I want to help win the game. And if the best route to go about it is me traveling with a guy -- I'll do it. If the coach sees otherwise, if he says left or right, I'll want to do whatever to help the team win."
 This is music to the head coach Doug Pederson's ears, particularly given how desperate the team was to fill the huge void at cornerback after being walked away from in free agency by former rival Byron Jones. So be it press coverage, zone, or full-on glueing himself to a specific wideout all game long -- Slay says bring it on. He's done it most of his career, and has no plans on stopping now that the bright lights of Philadelphia are beaming down on him.
 "I can get up in a guy's face for the whole game," he said. "I can switch up my technique from off to press. I'm comfortable in anything I'm doing. I compete every play. I'm not scared.
 "I'm not a cocky guy, just a confident guy. I feel like I just like to go play ball. I've been doing it the past four or five years and I've been very, very successful at it.
