The Foreign Ministry's budget took a 14.7% hit between 2018 and 2019, even though the state budget went up 4.3%. This was the largest cut to any ministry except the Interior Ministry, which conducted municipal elections in 2018.
 The significant cut to the Foreign Ministry's budget, lowering it to NIS 1.385bn meant that many of its core activities could not take place, because its basic functions cost NIS 1.53bn annually. The report warns that this could have a negative influence on Israel's relations with the world and services for Israelis abroad.
 The Comptroller also criticizes the Finance Ministry for trying to close seven diplomatic missions without doing research on how it will influence Israel's foreign relations.
 At the same time, the report praises the opportunities Israel has created to improve its image and standing in the world through the many government bodies that are active abroad.
 "The Foreign Ministry takes initiative to promote Israel's interests abroad, including a global forum, in cooperation with other government ministries, to deal with climate change," the report reads.
 The Comptroller's recommendations include setting national strategic goals for foreign relations and making clear what each ministry's responsibilities are in this area.
 In addition, one government body should be responsible for coordinating the various ministries doing work abroad.
 The report also called for there to be a dialog between the Foreign Ministry and Finance Ministry about the former's budget, so that the latter brings diplomatic and policy considerations into its decision-making process.
 The Comptroller's Office also recommended that UN payments be a permanent budget item that won't be affected by changes in the Foreign Ministry's budget.
 The Foreign Ministry expressed satisfaction with the report, because they said it supports the view that the Foreign Ministry should be responsible for Israel's international affairs and needs an increased budget.
 "The report shows clearly that the most professional body with the broadest view of the most foreign policy topics is the Foreign Ministry," a statement from the ministry read. "This is also the way many countries around the world work. The Foreign Ministry has unique abilities in the Israeli system, general knowledge and is spread around the world."
 The Foreign Ministry pointed to the parts of the report that said the Finance Ministry cut its budget, saying "the decision to close Israeli missions abroad was not based on professional considerations and the budget was prepared without coordination with the Foreign Ministry, who saw it only three days before it was approved by the government."
 "The unequivocal conclusion drawn [from the report] emphasizes the need to increase the Foreign Ministry's budget and to have an organized process of deciding the budget," the ministry added.
 Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that "the recent months in which Israel and the whole world is dealing with the coronavirus crisis proved once again the Foreign Ministry's importance to Israel's national strength and its centrality in the government's activities in the world, between returning Israel citizens in a time of crisis and bringing necessary equipment to deal with the pandemic."
 Senior officials in the Foreign Ministry expressed hope that its role in the government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis will help make its case before the soon-to-be-formed government passes a budget in the coming months.
 "The coronavirus crisis showed how important foreign relations are and how important it is to have feet on the ground. The Foreign Ministry has to be spread around the world; that makes the difference between success and failure," an official said.
 One official admitted that the Foreign Ministry has to do a better job presenting the importance of its work to the public and to the rest of the government, pointing out that the Health Ministry or Education Ministry are more directly involved in people's lives.
 "The image of the world of diplomacy is very different from the reality," he said. "This isn't something concrete like paying for hospital beds of M-16s, but it's important to Israel's economy, security, strength and well-being."
