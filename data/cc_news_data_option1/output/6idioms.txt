A contentious meeting of the Port Wentworth city council on Dec. 19 ended following the only real vote of the evening -- to adjourn.
   
 The meeting was expected to be combative as the four-member council majority planned an end run around the mayor and the two remaining council members.
   
 Thomas Barbee, Shari Dyal, Mark Stephens and Debbie Johnson planned to add items to the agenda to make Steve Davis the permanent city administrator and to confirm the firing of Matt Libby, director of public safety.
   
 Davis was Effingham County administrator for about a year, until October 2018 when he resigned abruptly, citing health issues and a desire to focus more on his family.
   
 In an email sent by Johnson to the Savannah Morning News on Dec. 16, the council woman said the termination of the city attorney would also be added to the agenda at the meeting. City Attorney Jimmy Coursey, however, resigned his post on Dec 18.
   
 Johnson did not respond to emailed questions regarding the agenda items.
   
 The current rancor between the majority, the mayor and two council members stems -- at least in large part -- from the Nov. 21 council meeting.
   
 At that meeting the four majority members changed the agenda, adding the hiring of Davis as city administrator.
   
 The hiring was a surprise to the mayor and two council members, Bill Herrin and Linda Smith.
   
 "We were completely blindsided," Norton said of Davis' hiring.
   
 Norton said Davis showed up at city hall on Nov. 22 with an employment agreement in hand.
   
 "I have not signed it and won't," Norton said.
   
 The agreement, according to Norton, calls for Davis to be paid $55 per hour for a maximum of 45 hours per week.
   
 Norton said Phil Jones, who served as the city's part-time city administrator until being made a consultant at the same November meeting where Davis was hired, had evaluated Davis' application for city administrator and marked it as not qualified.
   
 The job description for the post calls for two to five years of experience in city administration. Davis was administrator of Effingham County for a year.
   
 Norton said Davis has fired two "outstanding" city employees since he was "hired" on Nov. 21.
   
 Davis fired a city clerk, Sheryl Davis, who he is not related to, and the public safety director, Matt Libby.
   
 "According to the city attorney, Jimmy Coursey, Davis had no authority to fire," Norton said. "The charter states the mayor and council do."
   
 Norton said Davis also violated the city's human resources policies for discipline and has put the city at legal risk for potential litigation.
   
 Norton said in his opening statement that he was the chief executive of the city and had to make sure council followed the law and rules. He told the council any attempts to add agenda items would be ruled out of order.
   
 He kept his word through repeated motions by Barbee and Stephens to add the agenda items.
   
 Each and every time the motions were met with a strike of the mayor's gavel and an out of order ruling from Norton.
   
 Barbee also tried to have the mayor removed from the meeting.
   
 "Are you failing to act?" Barbee asked Norton several times.
   
 "We are going to move on with the meeting," Barbee said. "The mayor can sit there banging his gavel, but he has no authority in this meeting."
   
 Barbee said the city charter states that should the mayor fail to act, the mayor pro-tem can take over.
   
 "You can read can't you?" asked Barbee.
   
 Barbee also told Norton he did not have the right to rule him out of order.
   
 Following more arguments and shouts from the audience, Johnson made a motion to adjourn.
   
 Davis was booed as he left the council chambers.
   
 The majority four council members then left the meeting.
   
 Norton said after the meeting that he is receiving legal advice and will likely be heading to Superior Court to help clear up the issues.
   
 "If it turns out the hiring (of Davis) was legal, I'll be fine with it," Norton said.
   
 The meeting was Herrin's last. Glenn Jones won election for his seat in November.
   
 Herrin said he has loved serving Port Wentworth, but the Dec. 19 meeting was an embarrassment.
   
 Port Wentworth is scheduled to meet again on Jan. 23.

On August 9, 2014, an 18-year-old African-American man named Michael Brown was fatally shot by a 28-year-old white police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, in the United States . Brown was accompanied by his 22-year-old friend Dorian Johnson at the time of the shooting.
 Brown and Johnson were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive, a two-lane street in St Louis suburb of Ferguson, when a police officer asked them to use the pavement, news agency Associated Press reported. After a heated exchange of words between the two, police officer Wilson shot an unarmed Brown and killed him.
 The incident sparked unrest in the area, triggering a series of protests. The slogan “hands up, don’t shoot” originated from the protests against the killing of Brown. One witness had initially claimed that Brown had his hands up in the air before he was shot, but the account was later recanted. This slogan was then raised across the United States in cases of police violence.
 According to Wilson, Brown had first punched him in his face. The teenager also grabbed the police officer’s gun when he drew it to safeguard himself, Wilson added.
 To tackle the protests against Wilson, police in Ferguson used tear gas and rubber bullets, Associated Press reported. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon even declared an emergency and put Ferguson under curfew.
 Demonstrations against the Brown’s shooting also turned violent at times. In March 2015, two police officers were shot in front of the Ferguson Police Department during a demonstration.
 In November 2014, the decision to not indict Wilson was announced, leading to violence in the streets of Ferguson. Several buildings were set on fire, and vehicles on the road were vandalised.

One person was hurt in a neighborhood fireworks accident on New Year's Eve in Las Vegas, but high-profile celebrations on the Strip and Fremont Street went off without any major problems, authorities said Wednesday. The accident in a neighborhood in east Las Vegas sent one person to the a hospital with serious injuries shortly before midnight, the Review- Journal reported. Las Vegas Fire Department officials released few other details. Meanwhile, celebrations that drew hundreds of thousands of people to usher in 2020 on the Las Vegas Strip and Fremont Street were largely safe. Twenty-nine people were taken to hospitals, most because they'd had too much alcohol to drink, said Clark County communications chief Erik Pappa. The Nevada Highway Patrol also responded to a number of calls about drivers under the influence of alcohol. One person was also taken from Fremont Street for chest pains and another person on the Strip reported respiratory problems. With a temperature of about 40 degrees and calm winds, the revelers watched a choreographed eight-minute aerial pyrotechnic display on Las Vegas Boulevard at midnight. The downtown Fremont Street Experience pedestrian mall boasted an upgraded LED light and sound show. Hotel occupancy rates were near 100% and headline acts at various venues included Lady Gaga, Journey, Christina Aguilera, Maroon 5 and Third Eye Blind. Las Vegas Boulevard was closed for the celebrations, but had been reopened for traffic by about 5 a.m. as crews finished clearing away the tons of trash left behind.
