 "As with many other services, we are no longer in a place of business as usual, and so dentists have been working tirelessly behind the scenes over the past few months to restructure the way in which we carry out check-ups and treatments in order to help keep people safe and ensure the patient experience is as seamless as possible."

Relations between India and Australia will scale greater heights following the summit-level meeting between the two countries, the Australian high commissioner said on Monday.Brian O'Farrell's comment came ahead of a virtual meeting on June 4 between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Soctt Morrison.Calling both the prime ministers 'people person', the high commissioner also said that the two Premiers will discuss how to work together to improve people's lives."Both (Prime Minister Modi and PM Morrison) are people person; they'll be talking about how to work together to improve the lives of people. Both believe that the government is not about the number of agreements signed but improving the lives of citizens and generating jobs," news agency ANI quoted O'Farrell as saying. Apart from bilateral ties, the two leaders are expected to discuss the prevailing situation due to the coronavirus pandemic.The Australian PM told reporters on Sunday that he was looking forward to discussing the countries' responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, said PTI quoting a report in Australian Associated Press. "Prime Minister Modi and I will also discuss new opportunities in defence, trade, maritime safety and security, science and technology, and education," Morrison said."As like-minded democracies and natural strategic partners, Australia and India are in full agreement that our strong bilateral relationship is key to a more open, prosperous and inclusive Indo-Pacific," he said.Thursday's meeting will be Prime Minister Modi's first bilateral summit to take place virtually given the embargos on travel due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Australian High Commissioner said it will be "like a virtual interview between two friends"."The virtual summit meet will be like a virtual interview between two friends, discussing how each country is dealing with Covid-19. They may share commentary on the hard task of how to ease restrictions," ANI quoted Brian O'Farrell as saying.Australia has reported a total of 7,193 confirmed Covid-19 cases along with 103 deaths so far, according to PTI. India's Covid-19 tally, on the other hand, is inching towards the two lakh-mark. With more than 8,000 new cases and 230 deaths between Sunday and Monday morning, India's tally rose to 190,535 on Monday.On Sunday, the two Premiers indulged in some light-hearted banter on Twitter when Scott Morrison shared images of 'ScoMosas' and mango chutney made by him on his Twitter feed. "Sunday ScoMosas with mango chutney, all made from scratch - including the chutney! A pity my meeting with @narendramodi this week is by videolink. They're vegetarian, I would have liked to share them with him," Morrison posted on Twitter and tagged PM Modi.Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded to his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison's offer of sharing the 'ScoMosas' on Sunday, saying they look delicious."Connected by the Indian Ocean, united by the Indian Samosa! Looks delicious, PM @ScottMorrisonMP! Once we achieve a decisive victory against COVID-19, we will enjoy the Samosas together. Looking forward to our video meet on the 4th," PM Modi tweeted.Morrison, who was due to visit India in January this year, had to cancel his trip following the bushfire crisis in south-eastern Australia.

The stand-off between Indian and Chinese forces at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh continues with both sides reinforcing their respective positions. While tensions may be reduced through continuing dialogue in mechanisms put in place over the past several years, the key issue is whether Chinese troops agree to vacate the area they have occupied by violating the Line of Actual Control (LAC).China would be content if, after altering the facts on the ground, the stand-off is defused, say by a limited disengagement of a few metres between the troops, leaving most of the encroached territory in Chinese hands. China may agree to vacate the occupied area but expect concessions in return. These could include a halt to border infrastructure development on the Indian side of LAC, even the dismantling of built up structures. In the Doklam stand-off in 2017, the forces of the two sides disengaged. China halted additional road-building activity but continues to consolidate its position in the occupied area. The bottom line -- facts on the ground remain altered to China's advantage although India's action forestalled further ingress. Therefore, unless India is able to find an effective counter-strategy to this pattern of Chinese behaviour, incidents of the kind we have seen at many points on LAC are not only likely to continue but to intensify.There is another feature to the Chinese playbook. This is evident at the India-China border and in other theatres such as the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the Yellow Sea. Each Chinese action, taken in isolation, may not be regarded as threatening enough to require a strong and countervailing military riposte. Over a period of time, however, a string of such "isolated" incidents add up cumulatively to a significant change in the balance of power on the ground. China's dominance of the South China Sea, its occupation and militarisation of several offshore islands, have reached a point where only a major military offensive, perhaps even war, may be necessary to reverse Beijing's advantage. As is apparent, such risky actions are unlikely. At the most, one may expect the now alerted major powers, to prevent any further gains by China. So this is another important part of the playbook -- incremental advances short of the threshold of a likely military response from adversaries, but resulting over time in a more favourable balance of power. We have seen this at the India-China border over the years. There has beenconstant nibbling activity which the Indian side confronts, but it is unable or unwilling to go on a military offensive to reverse Chinese gains. We have to understand these salami-slicing tactics and develop an effective counter-strategy. This may require the ability to use the ambiguity of LAC to make asymmetric gains in zones where we have a tactical advantage. Only then will there be some bargaining chips available with us to restore the status quo.There is a third element in the Chinese playbook that needs attention. China calibrates its posture towards any country based on a careful assessment of the balance of economic and military capabilities. This may sometimes go wrong because Chinese leaders are relatively insular and self- centred in their outlook. There is a cultural predilection towards tactical agility, even deception, in interState relations and little patience with notions of statesmanship. After the 1962 war, China's default position on the border was the so-called package proposal, essentially formalising the prevailing status quo. In 1985-86, after the Wandung incident in the eastern sector, the package proposal was reinterpreted to mean that a settlement required India to make "meaningful concessions" in the east, the area of largest dispute, for which China would make appropriate-though-undefined- concessions in the western sector. Subsequently, it was conveyed that in any settlement, Tawang would have to be "returned" to China.What we now see is a further moving of the goalposts, with China's behaviour suggesting that the ambiguity over the precise alignment of LAC gives it the opportunity to trigger incidents at points of choice in order to make both local, tactical gains but to also convey a larger message that it has a stronger hand when dealing with India.Some analysts suggest that India should not provoke China by moving closer to the United States (US), the implication being that distancing from the US and other countries which China regards as adversaries, would somehow lessen the pressure on India. This is strange logic. It suggests that decisions on India's foreign policy are being made in Washington but should that be replaced by their being made in accordance with Chinese preferences instead? India's foreign policy should be made in New Delhi in India's best interests. It has been New Delhi's experience that strong relations between India and the US, indeed with other major powers, give India greater room for manoeuvre and ability to manage the China challenge. The more isolated India is, the greater its vulnerability to Chinese pressures.At this juncture, no military alliance with the US is on the cards. But building and strengthening a strong and credible countervailing coalition of major powers, which share India's concerns about the China's predatory predilections, is prudent policy even as India must marshal its energies to reduce the asymmetry of power with China which is at the heart of our current predicament.Shyam Saran is a former foreign secretary, and senior fellow, Centre for Policy Research The views expressed are personal

It has turned out to be the biggest confrontation between the two countries after the Doklam episode in 2017.On Sunday, the Indian Army dismissed a video purportedly showing a clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in eastern Ladakh describing it as "malafide."The two-and-a-half minute long video ostensibly shows a brawl between Indian and Chinese troops on the banks of Pangong Tso (lake). The Congress leader also expressed concern over issues raised by Nepal and hoped the government would find a lasting solution to it.

MILANO (ITALPRESS) - Intesa Sanpaolo ha messo a punto un'offerta di finanziamenti "green", ovvero mutui e prestiti personali con condizioni di tasso vantaggiose per chi acquista immobili a elevata efficienza energetica (classe maggiore o uguale a B) e chi effettua una riqualificazione volta ad aumentarne la classe energetica di appartenenza. In Italia, solo il 30% degli immobili appartiene a una classe energetica medio-alta, il resto necessita di lavori di adeguamento. Concorrono all'efficientamento energetico sia i grandi interventi, come la coibentazione dello stabile, sia i piccoli interventi, tra cui sostituzione di infissi, installazione di caldaie di ultima generazione, ecc. "Il prossimo passo di Intesa Sanpaolo - si legge in una nota - sar√† l'anticipo del credito previsto dal recente Decreto Rilancio, il cosiddetto Ecobonus, che permetter√† al cliente di realizzare i lavori necessari e quindi di incrementare il valore della propria casa anche se non dispone delle risorse necessarie".   Intesa Sanpaolo in Italia detiene circa un quarto del mercato mutui. La promozione di finanziamenti "green" √® in linea con l'Energy Efficient Mortgage Action Plan, iniziativa europea che punta a creare un mutuo per l'efficienza energetica standardizzato, i principi della circular economy a cui la Banca ha aderito e l'impegno sottoscritto con il Piano di Impresa 2018 - 2021 per lo sviluppo di azioni e servizi che riducano le emissioni.   La nuova offerta "green" √® disponibile sotto forma di prestito per la ristrutturazione e di mutui per l'acquisto o la ristrutturazione, anche per durate fino a 40 anni, finanziamenti al 100% del valore della casa e senza limiti di importo (surroga esclusa). Oltre a prevedere uno sconto sul tasso del mutuo, la Banca si fa anche economicamente carico, in caso di riqualificazione energetica dell'immobile, dell'attestato di prestazione energetica (APE), indispensabile per dimostrare il passaggio ad una classe energetica superiore.   Intesa Sanpaolo ha inoltre previsto alcuni servizi aggiuntivi in collaborazione con societ√† specializzate nel fornire assistenza professionale a chi ha a cuore le tematiche ambientali. In prima linea un servizio di supporto al cliente per valutare i benefici energetici e fiscali degli interventi di riqualificazione energetica. Un accordo con uno dei pi√π importanti comparatori online consente invece 2 di individuare in pochissimo tempo le migliori offerte per la fornitura di energia elettrica e gas presenti sul mercato. Possibile anche acquistare elettrodomestici di classe energetica A+++ dai partner convenzionati con Intesa Sanpaolo usufruendo di un finanziamento a tasso (taeg) zero.   Infine, per ogni finanziamento "green" erogato, Intesa Sanpaolo verser√† un contributo al progetto del WWF per la tutela delle api, insetti che garantiscono la sopravvivenza delle specie vegetali indispensabili alla vita del pianeta.

Nadia, a four-year-old Malayan tiger, inhabitant of Bronx Zoo (New York, USA), tested positive for Covid-19 in early April this year and soon six other feline zoo inhabitants showed similar symptoms. These animals had got the virus during a lockdown from a zoo employee, a human.It seems that no species is safe from the clutches of this deadly virus.The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) in India responded to the situation with specific guidelines on how to protect the wild animals from Covid-19 in the Indian subcontinent. But what will be the impact of this lockdown on the tigers and tiger reserves across the country?No tiger reserve in the country has reported any case of wildlife being infected by this Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease.There were reports that the camp elephants in Uttarakhand's Rajaji Tiger Reserve were showing symptoms of Covid-19. But these reports were wrong and many senior veterinarians confirmed that elephants cannot be infected by Sars-CoV-2.Also, the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan has reported that two tigresses have given birth to four cubs during this lockdown and the total tiger population of the reserve has risen to 20. This is a cause for celebration as the tigers had become locally extinct in Sariska around 2005 and the species had to be re-introduced from the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve. Initially, a few cubs were born to these tigers but then for a long period, no new births were recorded.Now there is less plastic and pollutants in the clear water of the rivers that originate from outside the boundaries of the tiger reserves. Because of the lockdown, incidents of illegal collection of honey have not been reported. This activity, along with the presence of tourists in the buffer zones of the reserves, contributed immensely to the incidents of forest fires. As a result, there has been a drastic reduction in the number of forest fires this year as a result of the lockdown.Another way in which this lockdown may have had a positive impact on the wildlife is by the reduced levels of glucocorticoids, a stress hormone in tigers. There are some scientific studies that indicate lower levels of glucocorticoids in tigers during the closed season when tourists are not permitted inside national parks.A higher level of this stress hormone has been linked to an adverse impact on the reproduction of the tiger, and consequently, the very survival of this creature. Therefore, these studies would suggest that this lockdown has been a boon in disguise for the tigers in India. But I would like to point out that in the last four estimates of tiger population in India, a constant rise in tiger numbers proves that tourism is not as lethal for tigers as concluded in these studies. If tourism, and the presence of humans around, did lead to a much higher production of stress hormones in tigers, then zoos all over the world would not have had any tiger in their enclosures. Because tigers in zoos are generally more stressed due to limited space and constant flow of the visitors throughout the year. But tigers are breeding well, producing litters, and surviving more in zoos than in the wild.So this takes us to the next part, the humans (officers and front line staff) involved in conservation work to figure out how this lockdown is affecting the tigers and tiger reserves? One has to take into consideration the impact on these people to get a complete picture of the impact of the lockdown on the wildlife.A discussion with them has revealed more about the ground situation in these areas.As per the guidelines of NTCA, tourism is permitted only in 20 percent area of a tiger reserve and most of our tiger reserves are open either for five or six months in a year. As per the policy of the government of India, tourism in Protected Areas (PAs) is permitted to educate people to elicit public support for conservation. I agree that unregulated tourism should not be permitted, where encircling tigers by tourist vehicles becomes a common sight and the management should come up with strict regulations to save the animal from such behavior by the tourists.Such regulations could include a ban on the driver of the vehicle and accompanying guide for a duration which should give them a chance to realise their mistake (but such scenarios are confined to only a few tiger reserves in India). Therefore, the lockdown is a big relief to the management of tiger reserves as the inflow of tourists has stopped and such untoward incidents are not happening.The constant phone calls to officers with requests to facilitate trips that are out of the usual routine have stopped completely. As a result, they are able to spend more time protecting the tigers. There is also more time available to the management of the reserves to contain poaching of animals, illicit felling of trees and land encroachment.Villagers within the vicinity or in the enclaves of the tiger reserves have limited access to resources for livelihood and food. Initially the lockdown aggravated the situation. To combat the issues of unemployment and lack of supply of essential commodities, the management of these reserves have come up with innovative initiatives to provide employment, health care and supply of rations from their own resources during this lockdown. The frontline staff in remote posts of the tiger reserves had it worse. They were not prepared for the lockdown and could not store food items, medicines and other essentials as they do during the monsoon when the tiger reserve is closed to tourists. Their regular supply of food, medicine and other essentials items are either delivered by vehicles involved in tourism or departmental vehicles every six to ten days. That supply chain got disrupted for staffers living inside the reserves.Let us take the example of Corbett Tiger Reserve to understand the initial impact of the lockdown on the frontline staff, where these frontline staffers live 40 to 65 km from the nearest habitation. The staff is totally dependent on camp elephants or boats for supply of essential items. But these vehicles weren't coming. On many days, they slept without proper food, surviving by eating boiled potatoes, wild fruits or rice with salted water. That ended only after the nationwide lockdown was eased and the supply chain was restored.It was a difficult time for the frontline staffers on the personal front too. Their families live either in small neighboring towns for the education of the children or in their native villages. They visit them at the beginning of the month after getting their salaries and make payments to shop keepers for groceries and other items purchased on credit.But they are putting in extra efforts. Some of them described their own problems as miniscule, comparing their plight with that of villagers in the forest enclaves. The villagers, they told me, neither have a permanent source of income nor a steady supply of essential items. The staffers called it their duty and privilege that they were able to help the villagers during the lockdown despite their limited means. And for this, I salute the zeal and spirit of the frontline forest staff of the tiger reserves.Now focusing on the people who work in the area around the reserve and are a part of the tourism sector. The nature guides, vehicle drivers, lower staff in resorts are helpless and many have lost their livelihoods. Resort owners, vehicle owners, and suppliers of goods and services have not been able to repay their loans because of the lockdown. With the closure period of the tiger reserves just round the corner, the recovery will take some more time. They need an alternate source of income and employment to sustain themselves.Overall, this means that the tiger reserves benefited from the lockdown because the managers had more time to focus on the protection and preservation of the wildlife. The animals were also positively affected because of the reduced human presence in their territories. And the frontline staff, in spite of the hardships, had been very effective in maintaining their areas and in performing their duties. Of course, the situation is not perfect but things are under control and the majestic beast with black stripes is safe.(Digvijay Singh Khati is a former Indian Forest Service officer and retired as principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand)
