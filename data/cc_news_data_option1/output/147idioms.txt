According to a Monday tweet, Owens is now in hot water with "The Good Place" star over her willingness to publicly defy current left-wing orthodoxy suggesting biological sex is not only separate from, but entirely meaningless when compared with, one's "gender identity."

No one will want to hear that, certainly not in Houston and not in any other NFL outpost where their team was probably watching the game on vacation. All anyone will want to talk about is how bad a coach O'Brien is, and how he should be fired.

But O'Brien wasn't wrong to know the game was far from over at 24-0. He just chose the wrong time to throw a curveball.

Yes, the Texans took a 24-0 lead and wound up blowing it. But it's not like the Texans jumped out due to some brilliant game-planning by O'Brien. The Chiefs were obviously rusty after the bye week (must be an AFC thing), with a blown coverage for a touchdown, a blocked punt for a touchdown and a fumbled kickoff that led to a touchdown.

ROY, Utah (KUTV/CNN) - While a popular Utah burger joint is known for its exotic meat specials, some customers say the restaurant shouldn’t have served kangaroo in light of the ongoing wildfires in Australia.Several customers at the Burger Bar in Roy, Utah, say selling kangaroo burgers as the exotic meat special in January seems like an ill-timed decision.“It’s probably not the best time to have it on the menu,” customer Rob Wilson said. “You see on the news images of kangaroos fleeing the fires through all the smoke and the haze.”Experts estimate more than 1 billion animals have perished in the Australian wildfires since September.But Burger Bar manager Joe Fowler says they ordered the kangaroo meat months ago. The order took a long time to process, and it finally came in at the end of December.“It was on a ship coming this way long before the fires started,” Fowler said.Fowler says they considered canceling the order and not serving the kangaroo, but they didn’t want the farm-fresh meat to go to waste."We actually considered not doing it, but kind of logistically, it’s very difficult to hold onto hundreds of pounds of meat. We don’t have space for it,” he said.The manager says they’re helping Australia’s economy with their business."It shouldn’t offend people. Really, it’s just hamburgers. We’re not making a statement or anything like that,” Fowler said.While the kangaroo burger may have turned some customers away, the Burger Bar says it brought many more in. The store announced Sunday on Facebook that it had already run out of kangaroo meat for the month after selling around 400 burgers in two days.Customer Bronson Volk was one of the people who got to try the kangaroo burger. He says he comes each month to try the exotic specials, and kangaroo is no exception."I think people should probably stop being so sensitive about stuff," he said.The Burger Bar says it never serves meat from endangered animals and will reconsider its position on kangaroo burgers if the wildfires cause a major population decline.Australia’s government allows millions of kangaroos to be hunted for meat each year.Copyright 2020 KUTV via CNN.

Every time I think that we can’t go lower, we do, and it is not just for the questionable objective of a well-thought out election strategy. For when a man’s public physical condition is considered fair game, then what is next? More pointedly, I do not believe that any political group that actually possesses any wisdom could believe that it may gain some advantage, some benefit, from such actions. I wonder where we will end up between now and March 2nd, and thereafter. Because already, there have been reports of unacceptable conduct in Laing Avenue and Sophia by PNC supporters on the one hand; and, on the other, there is this now vile and sickening development relative to the president’s health by PPP followers.

If supporters and citizens have to be led by the hand, and things spelled out to the nth degree, as to how they must conduct themselves, then so it must be. Leaders are responsible for instilling in supporters what is unacceptable; and leaders and citizens have an obligation to manage themselves better, toe an uninterrupted civilized line, if we are going to get anywhere, other than where we are now. To be frank, I am not optimistic in the least, but I owe myself and the segment of the public that cares to share these thoughts. We are just one-step away from the barbarous. May saner minds take charge.

24-hour view: "EUR continued to fall across Fri and as expected the major 1.1065 support was "out of reach" as 1.1085 was already quite a strong support (low of 1.1083 on Fri). We continue to expect both levels to hold today although risk is still to the downside. A bounce to 1.1135 may be on the cards today but is unlikely extend any further than 1.1150."

Open interest in EUR futures markets increased by just 366 contracts on Friday, clinching the third consecutive build according to preliminary data from CME Group. In the same line, volume rose by around 14.5K contracts, partially reversing the previous drop. EUR/USD now targets the 200-day SMA EUR/USD's positive price action on Friday was on the back of rising open interest and volume, opening the door at the same time for the continuation of the rebound from recent lows in the sub-1.1100 region and initially targeting the critical 200-day SMA in the 1.1140 region.

CME Group's flash data for GBP futures markets showed investors added around 8.6K contracts to their open interest positions on Friday. on the other hand, volume shrunk by nearly 14.9K contracts after three consecutive daily builds. GBP/USD now looks to 1.30 Cable's renewed downside was in tandem with rising open interest, which initially hints at the likelihood of extra downside in the near term. That said, the psychological support at 1.30 the figure emerges as the next key level if the selling pressure picks up pace. The moderate uptick in volume, however, could slow the pace of the decline and/or spark some bouts of consolidation.

Andrew Mear: Adapt to survive on the high street
 It’s perhaps a sign of this jittery climate that Ms Nickolds, who has been with the company since 1994, had only been in the post for three months and was set to take joint helm of John Lewis’ sister company, food retailer, Waitrose, whose previous boss only departed a few months ago.
 If you’ve never shopped at John Lewis – the Yorkshire branches are in Leeds, York and Sheffield – you might be wondering what all the fuss is about. Whilst retail experts fulminate and those who take an abiding interest in the future of the high street spend time trying to come up with explanations and suggestions, whole generations are growing up with no innate connection, and therefore no loyalty to, these once iconic brands.
 Talk to a young couple these days and if they have a wedding list at all, it’s likely to be online, at Amazon. Or more likely, they won’t be bothering with their bottom drawer at all in favour of hard cash or vouchers for a honeymoon. Boardroom shuffles may grab the headlines, but what they fail to take into account is the revolution in consumer habits which has been taking place under their noses.

I say this, because in the nasty, brutish political and social universe that is elections Guyana, we tactically and calculatedly observe no limits. Truly, when we descend to these depths, when we cannot have the discipline to manage ourselves, or the keen interest to rise to the occasion, or the restraint that speaks to decency and dignity, then we might as well swallow the ballot boxes, and drink the oil to our fill, since nothing has any meaning to us, other than those two destructive essences that dominate local existence. It is on occasions like these that I am ready to disown my treasured Guyanese birthright, to distance from the overwhelming tawdriness.

How low can we get? I think there is no bottom to the political gutter that runs through the length and breadth of this country, that makes monsters of some of us, which brings out the absolute worst in so many. Today, we find it comforting and satisfying to attack a man’s - a leader’s - health. Tomorrow we will derive great pleasure to condemn his or her sexual orientation and his partner and mother and extended family; and the next day it would be gratifying to scorn the colour of his skin, maybe even his impoverished state, his want and hunger. What kind of people are we, that nothing matters to us, but the barbarousness and swinishness that pervades? Surely, there can be some limit, some line that we will not cross, some element of our existence that we will hold as sacrosanct, and not even approach. The problem to my great alarm is that we have no such limit: not in mind, not to be practised, and not with any regard for our own standing. I suppose it is the reality of no holds barred, and any depravity during elections.
