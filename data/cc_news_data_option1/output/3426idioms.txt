Ole Gunnar Solskjaer became the club's fourth manager in just five years when he replaced Mourinho in December 2018, and he helped restore the club's Champions League place last season by finishing third behind runaway champions Liverpool and Manchester City.


  Matic, however, has set his sights higher for the coming campaign and believes there is no reason to think United cannot topple their rivals on Merseyside and reclaim the title.


  “From the next season there is no excuse. We have to go with everything," the midfielder explained on the _UTD Podcast._


  "We have to fight for the title because I felt that this year we dropped some points too easy.


  “We allowed Liverpool to win [the title], I don’t know, 10 games before the season finished. They won the league, so we cannot allow that. We need to fight to the end. We have to play with more confidence, with more responsibility.


  “My personal target is to win the league with United and I am sure that everyone wants to do the same. We have to promise our supporters that we will do our best - exactly what we have done after [the coronavirus lockdown] when we started to play again. That’s Manchester United.


  “We have to win five, six consecutive games then you can drop some points, then again you have to do that run. Like that we can win the league. In the beginning of the season we were not stable, we won one or two games then we lost and we drew. Proper United is exactly what we did after [lockdown] and I hope we can continue like that next season.”


  At 32 the Serbian is one of the elder statesmen in the Reds squad, as Solskjaer has attempted to rebuild his side around youth, in particular the potent attacking trio of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood.


  But he continues to play a key role at Old Trafford and, fresh from signing a new three-year extension, Matic signalled that he was delighted to continue with the club he joined from Chelsea in 2017.

On a positive note, Altered Carbon isn't ending due to Cancel Culture or anything along those lines, which is fortunate since it's been one of Netflix's big hits that people have responded to in a big way. But it is pulling up stakes since the show is a bit costly to make and the viewership for season 2 apparently hasn't been quite enough to keep the ball rolling so to speak, meaning that Netflix is looking to cut its losses and pull the plug before losing any more money that might not be gain the kind of return they want. Unfortunately in show business one has to realize that when too much money is going out and not enough is coming in the show is pretty much over and it's time to move on to the next idea. What will come next in this instance though is kind of hard to fathom at this time since Altered Carbon felt like a winner when it first came out and the second season appeared to be on its way forward even with the switch from Joel Kinnaman to Anthony Mackie, which wasn't a horrible switch really since both actors are pretty good at what they do and it's been felt that Mackie put a little more emotion into the role. Whoever people prefer though the story was pretty sound and the idea was intriguing since it utilized elements of storytelling that were capable of pulling people in from start to finish.

In 1887, a man named J. P. Johnston wrote "Twenty Years of Hus'ling." Intended as a brief summary of his life, it was instead, a 664-page book "Portraying the Peculiar Incidents, Comical Situations, Failures and Successes of a Man who Tries Almost Every Kind of Business and Finally Wins."


   


  Vinson A. Scott, bored with his life in Vinita, read the book from cover to cover, said good-bye to the eighth grade and his mom, and joined the Hagenback-Wallace Circus.


   


  Vinson spent two years in a Cadillac, with a chauffeur, scouting locations, hiring locals and clearing plans with local law enforcement. The pace was so hectic, he often slept in the car while the chauffeur drove. He said in a 1975 interview, "It liked to have drove me crazy".


   


  He moved on to assist Funny Owens, an agent for the 101 Ranch Show, doing basically the same thing, but at a more enjoyable pace. He loved the job, but problems forced the show to close.


   


  Vinson left the traveling life and married Clara Oglesby in 1924. They settled in Haskell and opened a bakery. After two years, a "bread war" caused him to turn off his ovens.


   


  Next, they opened the Kumback Kafe, a hamburger stand in Perry. In 1926, he sold it to a customer who had asked his wife if she thought he would sell it - to which she replied, "He'd sell anything except his wife. If offered enough, he might even sell her."


   


  Next, the pair hit the road for a short time with a "breathing" wax figure of Jesse James. He sold it after a short run.


   


  Scott's big break came while hanging out in the Tulsa Hotel. Always well- dressed, he often "borrowed" a cigar stub from a lobby ashtray so he would look even more important.


   


  Link Bowline asked him if he thought he could "sell" his seven-man cowboy band road show. Vinson's reply was that if he couldn't sell it, it couldn't be sold. He booked the show all over Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Wyoming.


   


  The band worked in the east for a while, but Bowline suddenly moved to Tulsa and Scott bought him out. He managed the band for about four years before moving to Pottsboro with aspirations of becoming a rancher.


   


  Scott was disappointed in the quality of his 80 acres and sold out for a "song," as he phrased it. The land later produced almost more oil than wells could handle.


   


  He bought a Model A truck and hit the road with another wax dummy, Tom Mix. He also had a paper-mache' horse that he painted a different color each week. He charged a quarter to see those and some cherished photos. A motel room fire in Louisiana created some problems, but no one was hurt. He lost some clippings and photos.


   


  As sales from the Mix show dwindled, Scott bought a tent, two trucks, a movie projector and sound equipment and traveled throughout Bryan County with "Scotty's Hollywood Tent Theater." His "biggest night" was in Bennington. Eventually he had difficulty buying gas and tires, and keeping workers. He settled in Bokchito, bought a building and operated the Hollywood Theater for six years before selling out to Jerry Easter.


   


  He liked Durant and built a home there on West Main Street. If you look at the grassy lot between the Lutheran Church and First United Bank, a set of old cement steps marks the entrance to 1516 W. Main.


   


  Not one to rest very long between "adventures," as he called them, classified ads in the 1953 newspaper show him advertising for "Texoma Aviaries" where he raised and trained parakeets. His prized one, Duke, temporarily escaped, but thankfully returned in a couple of days. Vinson had taught him 55 words and was preparing him for a television appearance.


   


  Other mentions of him include "publicity chairman" for a number of local events, an auctioneering business, a campaign for constable and service on a jury.


   


  One day, he encountered a woman standing on the corner of 7th and Main, crying over the damages done to the front of her building by movers. She lamented that it was beyond repair. He countered that it was not. To prove his point, he bought the building, repaired it, and turned it into a second-hand shop that he also managed. He got bored with it and sold out to Clint White.


   


  The last years of his life were spent selling metal identification plates and medical IDs from the back of his pickup. His wife usually accompanied him.


   


  He also traveled from town to town selling eyeglass cleaner to optometrists.


   


  Vinson A. Scott died of heart failure on July 18, 1975, after years overcoming the challenges of throat cancer and diabetes. He was 78. His wife, Clara, died in 1980.

“We all realize nothing is going to be fixed by tomorrow morning,” Tampa Bay defenseman Luke Schenn said. “But this is a situation where everyone needs to learn and ask questions and do what’s right and be a good person in the world.”


  The day, however, couldn’t end without a racial concern being raised.: The NHL is i nvestigating whether former Florida Panthers general manager Dale Tallon made racially insensitive comments before the team was eliminated by the New York Islanders in Toronto earlier this month.


  The investigation comes during a seemingly endless season in which Bill Peters resigned as coach of the Calgary Flames after it was disclosed he directed racist slurs at a Nigerian-born player in the minors a decade ago and kicked and punched players while with Carolina.


  Lightning coach Jon Cooper said he wasn’t aware of the allegations made against Tallon when asked how far the NHL still had to go in addressing racial concerns.


  “I don’t know. Can we sit here and say is it just hockey?” Cooper said. “To answer your question, is the league behind? No. The league’s just learning like everyone else. The league’s in a better place today than it was a couple of months ago, and definitely than it was a couple of years ago.


  “I’m telling you, that the players behind me are all trying to use this forum to be better,” he said. "We’re standing united on this front.”


  The one East coach who didn’t speak Friday was Philadelphia’s Alain Vigneault, who became the focus of criticism upon suggesting a day earlier he was solely focused on hockey.


  “I really have no idea what’s going on in the outside world,” Vigneault said. “This is the most important time of the year for us. It’s playoff hockey.”


  Flyers defenseman Matt Niskanen called Vigneault a “dedicated pro” who’s focused on winning a championship.


  “These are not easy times with everything going on. There’s a lot of layers to it. For us as players, we just want to do the right things and as a group we decided to take some action yesterday,” Niskanen said. “I’ll let AV answer questions about how he approaches life in the bubble with everything else going on.”

Este sábado se conmemora el Día del Videojuego o Día del Gamer, una actividad a la que son asiduos casi seis de cada 10 mexicanos y que superó 32 mil millones de pesos en valor el año pasado.


  De a cuerdo con The Competitive Intelligence Unit (The CIU), en 2019 el valor de mercado de los videojuegos creció 19.3 por ciento a tasa anual, su mayor incremento en una década.


  “La industria se ha diversificado, al encontrar nuevas fuentes de ingresos en el segmento de smartphones y servicios de streaming de videojuegos”, señaló la consultora en un reporte.


  Justo el mayor uso de teléfonos inteligentes ha estado detrás de la detonación de la industria del videojuego en el país. Según los datos recabados por la consultora, en México hay 72.6 millones de personas se consideran videojugadores o gamers, que equivalen a 57 por ciento de la población total del país.


  De los gamers que hay en el país, 72 por ciento utiliza su smartphone como principal consola.


  Desde juegos que se han vuelto clásicos como Candy Crush o Pokemón Go, hasta el popular Minecaft o versiones móviles de Call of Duty, son sólo algunos de los títulos que se ofrecen en las tiendas Play, de Adroid, o App Store, de iOS.


  “El número de videojugadores se ha catapultado por la masificación de los teléfonos inteligentes en el país (...) Ello ha facilitado el acceso a este mercado para segmentos de población que antes eran distantes a esta forma de entretenimiento y que buscan juegos casuales a precios asequibles”, indicó el reporte de The CIU.


  Las consolas fijas como Xbox, Nintendo o PlayStation son el segundo dispositivo usado por los gamers: tres de de cada 10 usuarios las utilizan para jugar, ya sea en línea o de forma tradicional.

(AP) - As the wind howled and the rain slammed down, a team of nurses, respiratory therapists and a doctor worked through the night to care for 19 tiny babies as Hurricane Laura slammed southwestern Louisiana.The babies, some on ventilators or eating through a feeding tube, seemed to weather the storm just fine, said Dr. Juan Bossano, the medical director of the neonatal intensive care unit at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital for Women.“They did very well. They tolerated it very well. We had a very good day,” he said.Laura made landfall early Thursday morning as a Category 4 storm, packing top winds of 150 mph (241 kph), and pushing a storm surge as high as 15 feet in some areas.Hours before it made landfall, officials had to move the babies from the women’s hospital to the main hospital in the system after it became clear that storm surge could inundate the women’s hospital, located on the southern end of Lake Charles. The hospital has its own generator and hospital administrator Alesha Alford said it was built to withstand hurricane force winds. But in the single story facility, there’s no room to move up and storm surge in that area was expected to hit nine feet.In a roughly two-hour operation the babies in the intensive care unit were transferred by ambulance to Lake Charles Memorial Hospital, a ten-story facility on the northern side of the city. Trucks carried needed equipment such as incubators.Alford said the storm hadn’t yet hit but “the skies looked very ominous.” She said everyone pitched in to get supplies moved to the other hospital.“It went as smooth as could be because we had everyone helping,” she said.Alford said three mothers who couldn’t be discharged from the women’s hospital were also transferred. Two of them had their newborns with them while the child of the third mom was in the intensive care unit. Parents of the other children in the neonatal intensive care unit couldn’t stay with them during the storm because there wasn’t enough room so Bossano said one nurse was tasked with calling parents to keep them informed of how their children were doing. Bossano occasionally posted updates on Facebook.Once they got situated at the larger hospital and the winds picked up, Alford said the patients were moved into the hallways. To “protect our babies,” mattresses were pushed up against the windows to prevent flying glass although none of the windows ended up breaking.She said as huge gusts of wind started coming in, they could feel the building vibrate.In addition to Bossano, the medical staff consisted of two neonatal nurse practitioners, 14 nurses and three respiratory therapists who worked on 12-hour shifts. Some of the staff slept on air mattresses in the hallway, Alford said.After making it through the hurricane, the plan was to have the babies stay in Lake Charles. While electricity was out in the city, the hospital has its own generator. But Alford said the city’s water system has been so heavily damaged that it ultimately forced them to transfer the babies as well as other patients to other hospitals around the state Friday.Both Alford and Bossano repeatedly praised the nursing staff for their work in caring for the babies that in some cases were born weighing only a pound or two. Some of the nursing staff lost their houses in the storm, and they were worried about their own families, but they put those concerns aside to care for their tiny patients.“Really the nurses and the respiratory therapists are the heroes here,” Bosanno said. “They showed that very clearly the way they performed.”__Follow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Due to an unknown injury I came down with severe sciatica in my left leg and hip. My doctor said it was probably exaserbated by twisting in and out of my low to the ground 2013 Mazda MX5. So I was on the hunt for something that was easy to get into. By far, and I have owned 25 cars now in my lifetime as a 55-year-old man, the Fiat 500 X is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. Plus after even after having Mercedes and BMWs I find it's electronics , infotainment system and build quality, superior. Fiat is right up there with Mazda in their top-of-the-line cars giving consumers the most bang for the buck you can possibly get for under 30,000. Even a stripper Fiat comes with creature comfort's that you don't see another cars like fully automatic headlamps. Such a minor thing but a nicety none the less . My Fiat 500 X Trekking Plus is top-of-the-line and is only missing one option , the all- wheel-drive feature and the only reason I don't have it is because it's next to impossible to get in Florida for some reason. None of the dealers are ordering it. But never mind, my car comforts me with the heated seats ,the leather, cornering lamps (by the way the cornering lambs are amazing, like personal luxury cars of yesteryear) the dual pane panoramic sunroof, Beats stereo , navigation, back up cam, crash sonar, ...omg the list goes on...it's gonna probably take me two weeks to figure out how to operate every single feature this car has. And with all the geegaws comes a glass smooth ride with none of that herky-jerky transmission stuff that other people talk about, and the solid feel that you get when you shut a BMW door..that wonderful muffled thunk. Plus, my dealer extends the warranty to 10 years 100'000 miles ! I think that Fiat is undervalued and this car is a game changer for the Fiat brand in America.

When Nike launched its “Just Do It” campaign in 1988, no one had any idea what would become of such a simple phrase. In just 10 years, the company’s worldwide sales skyrocketed from $800 million to more than $9 billion, annually. Three words was all it took to make the difference of a lifetime.


  I often think of what it might be like to make that sort of impact in my hometown of Fitzgerald, and am reminded that 2020 is a Census year. Impact on an exponential level for local and rural communities across Georgia can be achieved if every resident will take two minutes to “just do it.” The Census is an opportunity for local governments and nonprofits to ensure that our local tax dollars are returned via federal funding, for projects and essential infrastructure that can make the same difference that Nike did in 10 years, especially in smaller communities where opportunity often lacks investment.


  Based on Census counts, the federal government will distribute more than $1.5 trillion. Due to an undercount in 2010, Georgia lost about $708 per citizen of our own taxes because the state receives funding according to each person counted. According to the George Washington Institute for Public Policy, for every citizen counted, the state of Georgia receives more than $2,300 per citizen from the federal government. This amounts to almost $24 billion in federal funds across 55 different programs. These 55 programs include funds for school lunches for students, financial aid to low-income students pursuing higher education (Pell grants), community development block grants that support local economic development projects and subsequent job growth, Medicaid and Peach Care for kids (CHIP) who need it most, and funds devoted to rural programs that help infuse the state’s largest industry of agriculture. These are our hard-earned dollars and when we do not get counted other states benefit from our labor.

Making sure jurors can be brought together safely is of paramount concern, he said.


  “We have to have a place where we can operate functionally,” Edwards said. “People must engage in deliberations, and they have to be able to do that safely.”


  Delaying cases comes with some risks. In a community with a large number of rental residents, people move frequently, making it difficult in some instances to locate witnesses, for example.


  “All of those are issues we need to anticipate,” he said. “My view is always that justice delayed is not good. What we’re trying to do is when we get back to operations, we want to prioritize those matters that need to move forward.”


  Murder cases are not the only backlog in the system. Dougherty County grand juries typically hear about 100 cases each term, so when court operations resume there will be about 300 cases waiting to be heard.


  “There are a lot of other major cases that are important as well, a lot of the robberies, rapes and assaults,” Edwards said.


  The last murder case to be held ended the week before courts shut down in March.


  In that case Jazzy Jarrell Huff was found guilty on charges of felony murder, aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony but not guilty on a malice murder count.


  Huff was sentenced last week to a term of life in prison with the possibility of parole, meaning he can apply for release in 30 years.


  A short time later, it was discovered that one of the jurors had the coronavirus and an employee in the district attorney’s office also tested positive. Probate Court Judge Nancy Stephenson died of COVID-19 in April.


  Albany attorney Phil Cannon, who is representing Huff, said appeals will be filed for a new trial and also the status of the law under which the judge had no option but to impose a 30-year sentence.


  One change the Supreme Court is looking at when trials do resume is giving defendants the option of going to trial with a six-member jury.


  Cannon said that would be a non-starter for him as a defense attorney, not just on a murder charge but in any case where a conviction could bring a lengthy sentence.


  “Six-member juries are fine in certain situations, but it’s not a sufficient random selection of the community to make such a serious decision,” he said. “There’s no way on God’s green earth I’ll ever recommend a six-member jury on something as serious as a murder case.”

  Australia's Adam Scott, Canadian Mackenzie Hughes and Chile's Joaquin Niemann shared third on 211.


  Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy and Spain's Jon Rahm were on 212 along with two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson, Americans Brendon Todd and Kevin Kisner and Colombia's Sebastian Munoz.


  \- Expectant McIlroy -


  McIlroy revealed that his wife, Erica, is due to give birth to their first child, a baby daughter, within days.


  "We're about to be parents very soon, so we're obviously super excited," the Northern Ireland star said. "It's a private matter, but we're really excited and can't wait for her to get here."


  His caddie has a beeper and McIlroy has plans to skip the Tour Championship if he gets the call.


  "I'm going to play in many more Tour Championships and it's only going to be the birth of your first child once," McIlroy said. "That trumps anything else."


  Rahm matched the week's low round with a 66 despite a one-shot penalty for picking up his ball without marking it on the fifth green.


  "For some reason I picked up the ball thinking I had marked it already," Rahm said.


  Tiger Woods fired a 72 to share 55th on 220, well back of the third-place effort he needs to reach next week's season finale.


  The 15-time major champion found water off the 17th tee on his way to a triple-bogey seven and a third over-par round to start for the first time since 2010.

TRAVERSE CITY -- Vice President Mike Pence, flanked by construction equipment and "Make America Great Again" banners, touted President Donald Trump's policy accomplishments Friday while urging Michigan voters to support his reelection.


   


  Several hundred people, many wearing ponchos to protect against the rain, listened to Pence's pitch in Traverse City. Pence arrived in Michigan from Minnesota one day after Trump formally accepted the Republican Party's nomination for a second term.


   


  "Four years ago, you in Michigan knew it wasn't just a campaign, a movement was born," Pence said. "Here in Michigan, you believed we could be strong again ... Michigan said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016, and I know Michigan is going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020."


   


  Pence offered a contrast between the Trump administration's achievements and the Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. Repeating a theme heard throughout the Republican National Convention this week, Pence said the election is about "whether we will allow a radical movement to dismantle and destroy" the American way of life.


   


  "I know this movement is unstoppable, but we have to decide men and women of Michigan, we have to decide right here and right now, that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States," Pence said.


   


  Pence referred to the economy several times during his remarks, arguing the country's economic recovery is on the ballot. The vice president said Trump "made America great," before the coronavirus "struck from China."


   


  Michigan's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a national adviser to Biden's presidential campaign. She has criticized the Trump administration for downplaying the virus and moving too slowly to help equip states with testing supplies and medical equipment to prevent its spread.

Shortly before the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to close, sisters Armine Humphrey of Winchester and Narine Kyuregyan of Waltham opened Valentina Day Spa, 93 Concord Ave., Belmont. They recently re-opened with protocols in place to keep clients safe as they come in for services including facials, microneedling, microdermabrasion, dermaplaning, advanced medical Jet Peel treatments and hair restoration.


  Humphrey and Kyuregyan grew up in Armenia. Prior to opening their spa, Kyuregyan had a career as a dermatologist and Humphrey was a teacher and has served as principal of Erebuni Armenian School in Belmont for more than 12 years.


  "We thought that with my sister's medical background and expertise and with my business acumen combined, we can be business owners instead of working for someone else," said Humphrey.


  In 2016, Kyuregyan suffered a personal setback. She was diagnosed with breast cancer. She is now in remission.


  "After all the hardships that she went through, she stayed positive, strong, and followed her goals to open her own business," said Humphrey.


  The spa is named after their mother, Valentina.


  Humprhey said their goal was to create a clean, pleasant and friendly atmosphere for their customers.


  "We want them to feel special and pampered, disconnect from the daily stress, and just relax while they are at our spa," said Humphrey.


  Kyuregyan does the treatments and Humphrey is responsible for the day to day operation of the spa.


  The coronavirus was an unexpected setback, two weeks after their grand opening.


  "It has been tough for us since it is a new business, with many overhead expenses but we are happy to be back on track and welcome our clients," said Humphrey.


  Humphrey said they are seeing an increase in the amount of people suffering from acne and breakouts due to having to wear masks for so long," said Humphrey.


  "We don't just love making our clients look good outside, we make them feel good on the inside too. We learn about their lives. Our clients aren't just customers-they become our friends," said Humphrey.


  The sisters in business together said they hope to expand once this economic uncertainty goes away.

CIRCLEVILLE — The first quarter of the Logan Elm versus Teays Valley game began at 7 p.m. and was delayed until 9 p.m., thanks to several lightning delays.


  The Viking offense and defense controlled much of the opening period. The stout Teays defense stopped the Braves in the backfield multiple times while big plays by Teays running backs Landyn Brown and Camden McDanel cut through the Braves’ defense. The only slowdown for the Vikings was three lost fumbles. At the end of the first, Teays Valley led 7-0, with the lone touchdown by Brown.


  The second touchdown from the Vikings came early in the second quarter from a Brown run to lead 14-0. The Braves hit the air with three big passes behind Logan Elm quarterback Robinson before he snuck into the end zone to make it a 6-14 game. The extra point was blocked. The Vikings raided the air as well on their following possession with big passes from Tyler Love that was capped by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Love to Cooper Booth to give the Vikings a 21-6 halftime lead.


  During the halftime Logan Elm made changes that they hoped would tighten the score in the second half. Logan Elm Coach Terry Holbert said after the game, “They stuffed our run game pretty well. We knew we were going to have to rely on the pass to win the football game. So we we tried to spread them out and see what we could do on the passing game.”


  Jason Sailor took Logan Elm down the field with two big catches to set up the run-in score by Robinson giving Logan Elm 12 early in the second half. A bad snap ruined their chance at an extra point.


  The Braves recovered a squib kick on the kickoff, but a fourth down punt fake failed to get them out of a four and 15 in the mid field. After a couple of first downs, Teays Valley’s McDanel punched it in with an up-the-middle strut giving Valley 28 to Logan Elm’s 12.


  Logan Elm’s Robinson concluded a deliberate drive in the fourth quarter with a precision rocket to triple teamed Braylen Baker for a score. This time the Braves went for 2 and were denied, making it Logan Elm 18, Teays Valley 28.


  For their final score, Teays Valley drove the ball deep down into Logan Elm territory with clock eating runs. Not able to get the full seven from three tries in the red zone, the Vikings settled for three making it a two touchdown lead. With under three minutes to go, Logan Elm’s hurry-up offense found Evans in the end zone for a scoring catch and follow-up extra point. With a few seconds left on the clock, the Vikings took a knee for a final of Teays Valley 31, Logan Elm 25.


  Logan Elm’s quarterback Robinson passed for over 200 yards, hitting Evans about half the time for 109 yards receiving. On the Teays Valley side, McDanel rushed for 129 yards over 15 carries while Quarterback Tyler Love passed for 67 yard.


  After the game, Teays Valley coach Mark Weber said about Logan Elm, “They probably gave the players more than they expected. When they got in the dog fight, they were like, ‘These guys are for real.’”


  Although the Vikings walked away with a win, they thought the game was too close. Last year they won 41 to 7. Weber said, “Hopefully we’re going to progress and get better. Or we’re going to have some misery if we do not.”


  When asked about how COVID requirements are impacting his team’s training, Weber notes, “If anything this year, the #1 priority is the safety of my players. Period. The end.”

While the numbers of new COVID-19 infections and deaths have been greatly reduced, the number of new cases is still high, averaging about 214 per 100,000 population over the previous 14 days.


  That rate is considered high but is still better than what some surrounding communities and the state at large are experiencing, Ruis siad.


  “We are not out of the woods yet, and the disease is still prevalent in our community,” Dr. James Black, director of emergency medicine at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, said at the news conference.


  Since the previous coronavirus update two weeks ago, there were five additional deaths at Phoebe facilities, he said.


  Maintaining practices that help prevent infection is the best way to reduce the number of cases and ultimately fatalities, said Black, emphasizing the use of face masks, social distancing and frequent washing or sanitizing of hands.


  “You can’t easily tell who has COVID and who doesn’t,” he said. “They’re not walking around with a big ‘C’ on their chest.”


  As of Friday, there were 52 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Phoebe in Albany, 11 at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center and one at Phoebe Worth Medical Center. A total of 138 patients have died at Phoebe Putney Health System facilities during the pandemic.

ALMOLOYA DE JUÁREZ, México (AP) — La población carcelaria en México se ha infectado de coronavirus a una tasa más alta que el resto del país y las restricciones de actividades y confinamientos por la pandemia han reducido sus ya limitados contactos con el mundo exterior. Sin embargo, un grupo de internas en una prisión al oeste de la Ciudad de México se han beneficiado, pues en medio del confinamiento numerosos profesionales con tiempo disponible están donando clases por internet. Debido al cierre de escuelas, México continúa teniendo problemas con la educación a distancia. El gobierno decidió que se impartan clases por televisión este año porque muchos estudiantes no tienen computadora ni internet. Sin embargo, las reclusas en el penal de Santiaguito han descubierto un nuevo mundo tomando clases en línea; un número mayor de chefs, escritores y otros profesionales a los que habría sido difícil acudir a una prisión debido a los complejos filtros de seguridad, ahora están dando clases por internet a las internas. Esta cárcel de mujeres se ubica en Almoloya de Juárez, cerca de una prisión de máxima seguridad para hombres, de donde se escapó el jefe narcotraficante Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán por un túnel en 2015. Tatiana Ortiz Monasterio creó hace dos años la Fundación “Plan B”, una organización sin fines de lucro para traer un taller de costura, una biblioteca y clases a las reclusas. Sin embargo, ese primer esfuerzo resultó principalmente en un proyecto para hacer decoraciones para fiestas infantiles con hule espuma. Sin embargo, como dejó de haber fiestas infantiles por la pandemia –y las reclusas advierten que tendrán dificultades para su reinserción social cuando recuperen su libertad– el proyecto tuvo que pasar a otro nivel.

There was so little time for the Lakers to formulate a plan or figure out how they wanted to react.


  “We’re still trying to talk as a team to figure out our route,” Green said. “And also we have a lot of veterans on our team, so if things were to shut down, I feel like a lot of our guys would be OK, but we don’t think it would be fair for the younger guys, the younger generation, so we want to take all those things into consideration. We want to take care of all the guys coming after us. So we were waiting to see what the majority was saying. We weren’t trying to make a decision for the whole league.”


  The Wednesday evening meeting between union leadership and all the players in the bubble started and stopped many times, Green said.


  Thursday’s work was involved as well. The team woke up and had a meeting, before another group meeting with all the players in the bubble that began at 11 a.m.


  Later that afternoon, a smaller group meeting took place. The Lakers had five representatives — Green, James, Dwight Howard, Rajon Rondo and JR Smith — veterans who wanted to be clear on what was to happen. In the evening, the teams met with owners, with Jeanie Buss as the Lakers’ representative. They wanted to see action from the owners and got a commitment from them that they would promote voting, working on converting arenas into polling places for elections and run advertisements during games about social justice issues.


  The Lakers began the process of promoting legislation they felt aligned with these issues, starting with AB 2147, a bill that would improve employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated people who fought fires while in prison. They also plan to support California Senate Bill 203, which would increase the rights of juveniles before they are arrested.


  Players stayed mindful of their own behaviors too. When he arrived at practice, Smith asked his teammates whether they had registered to vote. The team set to work making sure any player who needed assistance would get it in registering to vote so they could do their part in civic engagement.


  “We’re not politicians at the end of the day,” Green said. “So it’s not our job to really save the world, even though we’re trying to.”

NATICK -- It hasn't been an easy ride for Oleg Abamelik.


  Years ago, he was forced to relocate his shoe repair business after it was destroyed by fire.


  Last summer, Abamelik's Cobbler Shop West on Pond Street barely escaped another fire just a few storefronts away that took out an entire downtown block.


  Now, Abamelik may face his toughest challenge yet in the 20 years he's been in Natick -- the coronavirus pandemic.


  "Business is dead. There are no people," Abamelik said.


  Determined to keep his store open through the pandemic and beyond, Abamelik frets about the number of customers he gets. On a good day, four of them walk through the front door.


  Abamelik isn't alone when it comes to high anxiety in the shoe repair business during COVID-19.


  Hundreds of cobbler shops nationwide could be forced to shut down, said Jim McFarland, president of the Shoe Service Institute of America, a national trade organization for the shoe repair industry. The main reason, he said, is that people are staying home and don't need shoe repair.


  "This is the hardest thing we've ever faced," McFarland said by phone from McFarland's Shoe Repair in Lakeland, Florida, a third-generation family business that started in 1918. He estimates his business volume has dropped roughly 50% during COVID-19


  The same goes for John Elhilow, owner of Superior Shoe & Boot Repair in Holliston and Waltham.


  "Every business feels it," Elhilow said of the financial devastation caused by COVID-19.


  Despite recent woes, McFarland believes the pandemic will not be the proverbial nail in the coffin for an industry that has been in decline for decades.


  "It's not the end, no way," he said. "It's the oldest recycling business in the world."


  There were 120,000 cobbler shops nationwide during the Great Depression in the 1930s, McFarland said. Before COVID-19, the number was 5,000, and the total could fall to 3,500 after the dust settles on the pandemic, he said.


  To have the best chance at survival, McFarland believes shop owners must get creative.


  That means get a website, and use it to promote mail-in business.


  "It really is the most effective thing I've seen in the 40 years running my store," McFarland said of his mail-in business, which he said now represents 20% of his revenues.


  Other suggestions include making internships available to college students with design skills who can promote the business on social media platforms, such as Instagram.


  Also, don't just fix shoes, McFarland said. Repair wallets, belts, luggage and handbags. Get into upholstering furniture, and sell shoes and arch supports.


  Abamelik and Elhilow offer those services. Elhilow took it a step further -- he learned new repair techniques to keep up with changing materials in shoes, especially in the medical field.


  Elhilow encourages cobblers to renegotiate leases with landlords during these difficult times.


  "It's the best thing you can do," he said.


  YouTube help


  Soliciting the help of YouTube stars could be another way to boost business.


  The Shoe Service Institute of America was in the process of pursuing the help of Kirby Allison before the pandemic hit, McFarland said. Allison has a YouTube channel with 152,000 subscribers that gives tips to the well-dressed so they can acquire and care for their wardrobes. The institute believes Allison could help the industry boost its business fortunes through his YouTube channel.


  Before COVID-19 hit, the institute produced several videos for YouTube to explain the industry and its services. Plans were in the works to heavily promote the videos, but COVID brought those efforts to a standstill.


  Abamelik, 64, wants to keep his 250-square-foot shop going for a few more years before retirement. But with daily customer numbers in the low single digits, meeting his $600 monthly rent is a challenge. There's also the added challenge of the proliferation of discount shoe stores and internet sales -- which can be cheaper and faster than having an old pair of shoes repaired.


  But even with those market forces, Abamelik feels his industry will survive, because people like the comfort of a broken-in pair of shoes that just need a little fix to keep them serviceable. And customers buying shoes on the internet didn't try them on before the purchase, so the odds are good some will need custom repairs to make them fit properly.


  Elhilow believes his business will survive COVID-19 because of the array of services he offers, but worries about those cobblers who had falling sales before the pandemic.


  "Those who were slow before COVID-19, forget it," he said.


  Abamelik's current reality is simple.

Real Madrid have reportedly agreed a deal to send striker Mariano Diaz on loan to Benfica for the 2020-21 season.


  Zinedine Zidane is set to begin a squad overhaul in the coming weeks, with Diaz one of the names expected to leave the Spanish capital.


  Colombian international James Rodriguez is rumoured to be on the verge of joining Premier League side Everton, with Brahim Diaz linked with AC Milan and Oscar Rodriguez already joining Sevilla.


  However, despite Real Madrid’s confidence of offloading Diaz, a report from Marca claims the former Lyon star has not been contacted over the move, with no agreement in place with his representatives.


  Diaz rejected the chance to leave Madrid last summer, despite slipping further down the pecking order following the arrival of Serbian international Luka Jovic.


  But with just three La Liga starts to his name in the last two seasons, and zero in 2019-20, his time in Madrid looks to be over.

If there's one big drawback to the car, it's the speed, or lack there-of. This is a slow car, no two ways about it, and it doesn't want to be rushed. Thankfully, the engine is well isolated so you won't feel like you're in an economy car when entering the freeway. Luckily speed is the CT's only dynamic downfall. In the hills this little hatch can hold its own when the going gets twisty. Steering is numb but razor sharp and laser precise. The suspension has hardly any role either. The Sport Mode doesn't make the car any faster, but rather sharpens throttle response and weights up the steering for a sporty feel, useful for freeway or canyon use. Power issues aside, the CT never feels like a detached, isolation-pod hybrid whose only purpose is to suck the joy out of its owners in exchange for better savings at the pump.

It looked like Battle football assistant Xzavie Jackson couldn't believe it.


   


  How could Fort Zumwalt North make the same mistake twice?


   


  There was no way Panthers head coach Joe Bacon wanted the second-half kickoff to be anywhere near Battle junior running back Gerry Marteen. Literally anyone else would have been better.


   


  The Panthers did kick it to Marteen, however, and Jackson began bouncing up and down on the sideline while watching Marteen break free once again, this time for a 90-yard kickoff return touchdown to put the Spartans up 40-28.


   


  "Keep kicking to him!" Jackson shouted as Marteen ran into the back of the end zone. "Keep doing it!"


   


  Marteen had just scored his second kickoff return and his fifth touchdown overall as Battle was enjoying every second of its triumphant 60-43 season- opening home victory over Fort Zumwalt North.


   


  "Honestly I was shocked," Marteen said about the kickoff to start the second half. "But we had good blocking so it worked out."


   


  Marteen nearly had 300 yards of total offense on the night -- by himself -- before senior quarterback Jack Newcomb and the Panthers ran a single play in the third quarter.


   


  The difference that 287 days can make proved to be drastic as the Spartans cruised to victory. The last time Battle played the Spartans was in O'Fallon last year in the Class 5 District 4 championship. That 63-20 loss was one of the worst games in Battle's short, successful program history.


   


  Forty-three points separated the Spartans and victory that night, and head coach Atiyyah Ellison had to remind his team after that game that it would face the same opponent to open the 2020 season.


   


  "Initially after a loss like that, you go back and forth with a lot of things that you could have done differently," Ellison said. "I was planning on posting the score in the weight room or something like that for the whole offseason, but I didn't end up doing those things. I just told them to focus on us and not to worry about someone else's team. Let's focus on us and what we do well."


   


  Everything leading up to the rematch was abnormal. COVID-19 changed everything. No spring workouts, but Zoom meetings to discuss film. Summer workouts came with social distancing and masks. There were questions less than 48 hours before kickoff whether Columbia Public Schools would even play its Week 1 games.


   


  But nothing, not even a global pandemic, could keep Battle and Ellison from righting the wrongs from last November. Battle dominated in a game that felt personal, and after Marteen's second kickoff return to the end zone, the Spartans were in complete control.


   


  It began with a 5-yard touchdown run by Marteen on the Spartans' first drive, five plays after Chris Futrell fumbled near midfield. Marteen followed that up with a 35-yard touchdown run on Battle's next possession. Fort Zumwalt North answered with a 3-yard touchdown scramble from Newcomb, but on the ensuing kickoff, Marteen struck again with an 85-yard kickoff return.


   


  "That kid is dynamic," Ellison said. "He's a really hard runner, a tough kid and a program guy. ... When he has a full head of steam and he's running really hard and believes in the offensive linemen, that's the result."


   


  The Panthers rivaled that frenetic pace in the first half. Newcomb delivered a 34-yard touchdown strike with just over eight minutes left in the second quarter to make it a one-score game.


   


  One minute later, however, Marteen broke off a 53-yard touchdown run to put Battle up 32-21.


   


  "The O-line was making holes that there was no way I could miss," Marteen said after the game. "I saw green and went through it."


   


  The Spartans dominated the second half, scoring on their first three possessions while forcing three consecutive turnovers. Newcomb continued to add to his impressive outing with two fourth-quarter touchdowns as the Panthers' high-powered offense continued to move the ball. Fort Zumwalt North scored 43 or more points seven times last season.


   


  But Battle wouldn't be denied -- especially on its senior night.


   


  Ellison wanted to make sure his 22 seniors would be honored at home in light of this season's unusual circumstances due to COVID-19. The Spartans responded with a victory they had to have.


   


  "I think we needed a game like this to shake off that feeling from last year, especially against the same team that beat us like they did," Ellison said. "When (this team) believes in themselves and everybody works together for that common goal, it's one of those feelings: You can't stop them."


   


  Battle is scheduled to host its inaugural Central Missouri Activities Conference game against Capital City at 7 p.m. next Friday.

I think this is highly plausible given that hospitality jobs have been the hardest hit and that this super sector has some of the lowest wages. Hospitality is also female dominated, which further drives down wages. As an example, according to the MIT living wage calculator, one adult with two children in El Paso County needs $31.67 per hour, or $65,874 per year, in order to meet essential expenses such as food, child care, medical, housing, transportation and other costs in addition to paying taxes. If a household has two adults working with two children, each adult would need to earn $14.79 per hour, or $30,763 per worker per year. Minimum wage is $11.10 in Colorado, which translates to $23,088, annually and the nation’s rate is significantly lower at $7.75, or $16,120 annually. Minimum wage only comes close to meeting the living wage in El Paso County for a single adult with no children: $11.99 per hour. The Colorado minimum wage only comes close to meeting the living wage for young, single, or still dependent workers, but no other demographic.


  This is not a value judgement in my estimation. It is the reality of the American profit-driven economic model that emphasizes competition to keep prices low (not a bad thing) and that ensures higher returns to owners and investors while letting the workers carry the brunt of the competitive model through their lower wages. It is true that owners and investors are carrying risk while a low-wage hourly worker bee is not. However, in most cases people take risks they can handle financially, and once initial investments have proven sound and profitable, the ongoing revenue stream to owners and investors can be ten, a hundred or even a thousand-fold more than the time investment a worker makes through an hourly wage.


  Case in point is the fact that the top 1% of earners in the U.S. account for about 20% of the country’s total annual income while the lowest earning 25% of Americans account for only 3.7% of total U.S. annual income. In terms of wages, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the average wage for each worker in the top 10% was about $100,000, while the bottom 10% earned about $21,000 per year, or about one-fifth of what the top earners made. And these are wages, which do not incorporate holistic income from other assets.


  This bifurcation is blatantly apparent in the sharp contrast between the continued stock market run and the lower-skill, under or unemployed individuals who are living paycheck to paycheck, increasingly defaulting on loans, falling behind on rent or mortgage payments and increasingly relying on social assistance. It’s a tale of two peoples.


  Economists always emphasize that individuals largely make rational decisions based on what is best for them. The inherent challenge that COVID has amplified is that our economic model, while having a plethora of strengths, is not working for many low-skill, low-wage workers. And if we simply strip away all benefits to try and incentivize more people to work, that won’t change the fact that many lower-skill workers simply cannot make ends meet at current (low-skill) wage levels. That brings me back to the underlying truism that in order to have an economy that thrives, people have to thrive.


  Thriving people buy more stuff and that feeds capitalism. Thriving people are physically and mentally healthier (in El Paso County there is 16-year difference in life expectancy across census tracts). Thriving people obtain more education, which enables them to have better jobs, pay more in taxes, draw less on social programs, innovate, and start businesses. It’s not just a warm and fuzzy thought, it’s one of the things I think about in terms of the long-term sustainability of our country. I am an economist so believe me; I inherently love capitalism. It needs some serious tweaking though, and COVID has just given me the courage to say it out loud.


  There are, of course, other reasons people are not currently participating in the labor force. Some people have pre-existing health conditions or someone in their family does, so they do not want to risk getting sick. Many workers, primarily women, are not able or willing to put their child(ren) in childcare. School has now started, and most districts are either online or hybrid, further restricting how much parents can work. Yes, this is COVID-specific, but the affordability of childcare in the U.S. is yet another structural issue that has limited labor participation well before COVID. With the Legacy Institute, I did an analysis about a year ago that showed a 19% annual return on investment for communities that invest in a subsidized pre-kindergarten 4’s program, mostly because of the increase in adult labor participation. I went further and conservatively measured the improved academic performance and graduation rates of kids who have access to early learning. (There have been a lot of studies validating this.) The annual ROI increased to 22%, again largely due to higher labor participation by those kids with early learning advantages.


  Another major issue around labor participation is the skills gap, which I have often written about (articles at uccseconomicforum.com). Even prior to COVID, hospitality jobs were declining in number mostly due to automation, robotics, and simple preferences towards virtual services like online buying. Those displaced workers could be put into rapid and scaled national training programs for jobs that are in high demand. Many of those jobs require certifications and not four-year degrees. But whatever the requisite training, helping displaced workers pay for relevant, high-demand training has a long list of benefits for individuals, families, and the economy at large. It's a great investment. We just need to make it an easy, accessible and rational choice for those segments of our workforce who need upskilling.


  I am not the only economist who constantly thinks about these things. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has talked more than any other chair I can remember about viable jobs, wages, income inequality and its perils. I believe one of the most detrimental aspects of large income disparities centers around racial inequalities. The reasons for racism are multi-faceted and complex, and that is a whole other dissertation. I will say that the income inequality I am talking about propagates social ills such as racism. Social ills fester when there is generational poverty with less and less socio-economic mobility. And when that generational poverty is concentrated in certain racial/ethnic minority groups, the income inequalities further cement the racial inequalities and racism in general. It’s a perilous cycle and no surprise to me that COVID has elevated the tensions around income and race inequality. COVID has once again accelerated and amplified a trend that is not new, but less tolerated under the strain of economic uncertainty, especially income uncertainty that disproportionately effects the bottom earners.


  I’ve painted a rather bleak picture, but I innately go back to the positive. As devastating as COVID has been for many businesses and individuals, I believe its severity can possibly shake up norms. Disruptions do spark innovative thought, and disruption can motivate out-of-the-box action. It takes looking at the data, recognizing the shortcomings in our political and economic systems, and agreeing that we should not be a nation of two peoples irreconcilably divided by political affiliation, income, or race. Maybe I am a hopeless optimist, but I think we can be better than that, and that perhaps COVID can be our springboard.

Slavery existed in Africa before the Europeans came but the colonisation of the Caribbean islands opened up a dark new chapter.


  When, in 1562, the English sailor Captain John Hawkins captured 300 Africans and sold them in the "Americas" he made so much money others were quick to follow.


  At first the London-based Royal African Company had a monopoly on this sinister cargo but other cities, notably Bristol and Liverpool, lobbied successfully to get involved.


  Then, in 1707, the Act of Union paved the way for Scottish ships to join what became known as The Triangular Trade.


  The first stage of the voyage took them to West Africa, carrying goods such as glass, textiles, metal or guns that could be exchanged for captured Africans.


  All along the coast were "slave forts" where captives - taken there usually by African middle-men - were stripped and chained, ready to be traded.

The Theatre District Living and Learning Neighborhood, a proposed UCSD expansion as part of the university’s 2018 long-range development plan, or LRDP, was formerly called the Future College Living and Learning Neighborhood. It is planned for La Jolla Village Drive at North Torrey Pines Road and calls for five buildings ranging from nine to 21 stories tall. TDLLN is designed to house 2,000 students with space for a conference center, hotel rooms, classrooms and retail and includes a 1,200-space parking garage underneath.


  After UCSD held an open house in January to explain the project, there were several meetings among LJSA, other La Jolla community group leaders and UCSD representatives during which UCSD was asked to hold a public forum to garner community input, Emerson said.


  “We talked about the fact that La Jolla needs to know about this,” Emerson said. “Having these little groups on campus [like the UCSD open house] doesn’t get the word out to the public. There are plenty of meetings down in La Jolla where you can come and present this to the community.”


  In March, UCSD agreed to a public forum set for April 2 with LJSA, the La Jolla Traffic & Transportation Board, the La Jolla Town Council and LJCPA, according to Emerson. The coronavirus pandemic scrapped the event, however, and another forum was never set.


  In the months since, Emerson said, LJSA has asked UCSD repeatedly to pause its timeline for the development “so the public could get together. [UCSD] absolutely refused,” she said.


  Leslie Sepuka, UCSD associate director of communications, said in an email to the _La Jolla Light_ that the university welcomes community feedback.


  “As the result of our continual outreach to the community, several design features incorporated into the Theatre District Living and Learning Neighborhood are a direct result of community input,” Sepuka wrote, citing open spaces, extra parking and other elements.


  LJCPA President Diane Kane said UCSD approached her to present to the Community Planning Association, but the group’s agenda was heavy with other time-sensitive issues.


  Eventually, Kane said, “we tried to set up a 15-minute presentation, [after which UCSD] would take questions from interested parties.”


  “We were looking to find out what are the community issues,” Kane said. “What we were asked to do [by UCSD] was craft a letter on the project to the [University of California] regents on behalf of the CPA. To be able to do that, it has to be an agendized item under the Brown Act, open for public discussion.”


  UCSD plans to present the TDLLN project to the Board of Regents during its meeting Sept. 15-17 for approval to begin construction.


  LJCPA invited the university to present at the planning group’s Sept. 3 meeting. Emerson said in an email chain among her, UCSD community liaison Anu Delouri and CPA leadership that UCSD agreed to a presentation and Q&A format. CPA trustees would then deliberate before sending a formal communication to the regents with their feedback on TDLLN.


  Delouri withdrew the planned presentation Aug. 21.


  “I’m disappointed,” Kane said. “We tried to come up with … a neutral space where the entire community could participate and get a conversation going with the university. It just didn’t seem possible.”


  Kane said that during a conversation with Delouri on Aug. 27, the UCSD representative said she will present a brief update at the Sept. 3 meeting, including changes “based on community comments to date.”


  But since the update will not include public comments or discussion, Kane said LJCPA is “not going to respond formally as an organization. … We can’t do what we are intending to do.”


  Sepuka said “the university does not have any new project design updates to share with the community on the project.”


  “As previously shared,” she said, “the next update will be when the addendum (consistency analysis) to the 2018 LRDP environmental impact report (EIR) is posted on the PlanDesignBuild website, _plandesignbuild.ucsd.edu_ , in September.”


  Sepuka encouraged those interested in receiving updates to email _commplan@ucsd.edu_. ◆

Cultivating and harvesting produce from the hydroponic towers and the dirt garden is one of the highlights of the week. I love that we have enough to satisfy our own needs and those of glampers who book the chef, but also to sell to local customers. While maintaining these spaces can sometimes be challenging, clearing weeds out of the dirt garden or adding more nutrient water to a tower doesn’t require a lot of concentration. Again, these chores allow me time to think and even problem solve.


  When I’m walking around the property, or sometimes just looking up from what I’m doing, I’m often drawn in by the sight of a wildflower swaying gently in the breeze or a hawk soaring high in the sky. Today I noticed the limbs of the persimmon trees were weighed down with the yellow fruit. Three months ago wild plums were abundant. It seems that with every season comes the renewed surprise of something growing that we didn’t plant.


  I definitely have stressful days, but then there are days like today - where every interaction, every discovery, every minute spent in thoughtful reflection on the farm brings me a sense of peace and calm.

Kickapoo and pitcher Emily Flacklam continued their mastery of Nixa on Friday, as the Lady Eagles suffered a 9-0 season-opening setback.


  Flacklam blanked Nixa on five hits. Dating back to last season, she has allowed just one run and struck out 12 in three starts covering 16.2 innings against the Lady Eagles.


  Kickapoo has outscored Nixa 30-4 in those three games.


  Going to her changeup more and more as the game proceeded, Flacklam needed just 76 pitches to go the distance Friday. Her counterpart, Nixa pitcher Maddy Meierer, threw 126 pitches.


  Meierer yielded 10 hits while striking out four and walking three, two which were intentional.


  Nixa's best chance to make Friday's game competitive came in the first inning. The Lady Eagles' Phoebe Gardner singled and Emma Vincent doubled with one out. But they were left stranded.


  Meierer doubled in the fourth with one out, but couldn't advance.


  Nixa was guilty of three errors, leading to six unearned runs.

  To help prevent the spread of coronavirus, UA President Stuart Bell urged the community in a Wednesday letter to wear masks and social distance, both on and off campus.


  "At this critical time, we must be united and fully committed in our fight against COVID-19," Bell said. "I believe we will be successful this semester, and we all want to remain on campus throughout this fall, but we can only do so with your daily assistance."


  Bell had previously called the rise in cases "unacceptable" and told students and faculty that university police and Tuscaloosa police will monitor restaurants, off-campus residences and Greek housing to ensure patrons and residents follow coronavirus safety guidelines. Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox on Monday also ordered all bars in the city to close for two weeks due to the rise in cases.

I've been thinking about the two families we've encountered over the past two weeks. The Biden family is emotionally open, rendered vulnerable by tragedy and driven by a powerful desire to connect. The Trump family is emotionally closed, isolated by enmity and driven by a powerful desire to dominate.


   


  Occasionally this week one of the female members of the Trump family would struggle to stick her head above the muck of her family's values and display some humanity. But Donald, Don Jr. and Eric showed no such impulse.


   


  Trump family values are mean world values. Mean world syndrome was a concept conceived in the 1970s by the communications professor George Gerbner. His idea was that people who see relentless violence on television begin to perceive the world as being more dangerous than it really is.


   


  By the 1990s it was no longer violent programing that drove mean world culture, but reality television. That's an entire industry designed to give the impression that human beings are inherently manipulative, selfish and petty. If you grow up watching those programs, or starring in them, naturally you believe that other people are fundamentally untrustworthy.


   


  These days mean world culture is everywhere. Menace is everywhere. This week's Republican convention was a four-day cavalcade of the mean world alarmism.


   


  Mean world thrives on fear and perpetuates itself by exaggerating fear. Its rhetorical ploy is catastrophizing and its tone is apocalyptic. The Democrats are not just wrong, many speakers asserted this week, they are "subverting our republic," abolishing the suburbs, destroying Western civilization and establishing a Castro-style communist dictatorship.


   


  The St. Louis couple Mark and Patricia McCloskey are the team mascots of mean world. They see Black Lives Matter protesters walking past their mansion and decide they're in the middle of a race war. They come out waving their guns.


   


  The implicit argument of the Republican convention was that Joe Biden is too old, or soft, or compassionate to survive in mean world. He'll cower before rising crime rates. He'll get pushed around by the hard left. He'll get swallowed in the maelstrom. "You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America," is how Mike Pence put it.


   


  This is the Republicans' strongest argument, especially if murder rates continue to soar and if Portland and Kenosha-style mayhem becomes commonplace this fall. Democrats have foolishly allowed themselves to be portrayed as the enemies of policing. There's a lot of fear floating around America right now, available to be exploited by someone.


   


  But let's also be clear about what the real threats are. In many ways this election is about two rival versions of threat perception. It will be won by whichever party more persuasively identifies what we should fear.


   


  Yes, there have been disgraceful scenes of far left physical and verbal brutality, which get magnified on Twitter. The far bigger threat, however, is that we have a president too busy fighting a culture war to respond to a pandemic and an economic crisis, or even to perform basic governance. What part of 180,000 coronavirus dead does Donald Trump not understand?


   


  The larger threat is that we're caught in a polarization cascade. Mean world fanatics -- on the left and right -- are playing a mutually beneficial game. Trumpian chaos justifies and magnifies the woke mobs on the left. Woke mobs magnify and justify Trumpian authoritarianism on the right.


   


  The upshot of the mean world war is the obliteration of normal politics, the hollowing out of the center and the degradation of public morality. Under the cover of this souped-up, screw-or-be-screwed mentality, norms are eviscerated, truth is massacred, bigotry is justified and politics turns into a struggle to culturally obliterate the other side.


   


  Joe Biden is going to have to take on this widespread anxiety about personal safety by insisting that the real source of danger is Trump's chaotic incompetence and that Trump's mean world extremism is corrosive to the social order. When the social order dissolves, people suffer.


   


  Biden could point out that disorder from left and right will only accelerate so long as Trump is in the White House. He could make clear that compassion is not weakness, that the toughest thing is to stand in a hailstorm of hatred and insist on kindness and consideration.


   


  In a civilized society law and order is not established with a bullying jackboot. Law and order is established through the calm, regular enforcement of decency, so people across society behave like stable, honorable human beings.

But the location in the upper north Mankato park seems like it was designed for him. You get just a glimpse of him from the distant parking area on the north end of the park, sitting amid the tall prairie grasses. His gaze is to the east, looking over a sweeping prairie and wetland. The city, with guidance from two local Native Americans, found a spot that is solitary and serene but easily accessible.


  The statue was carved, off and on for about 17 years, by local sculptor Tom Miller, who has several other large works on display locally. He eventually sold it to a man who for years kept it in his lower North Mankato side yard along Belgrade Avenue.


  It may seem odd to some that Sitting Bull has become a local landmark at all. The chief never set foot anywhere near this area. After he'd fled to Canada and then returned to surrender to the U.S. Army, he was placed on a reservation and was at times allowed to travel. In 1884 he visited St. Paul but that was as close as he got to southern Minnesota.


  Still, Sitting Bull's famous legacy had ties to the Dakota who battled with the U.S. Army in 1862 in the New Ulm area. After the 1862 war and execution of 38 Dakota in Mankato, the U.S. Army sent Brig. Gen. Henry Hastings Sibley to what is now North Dakota to punish the Santee Sioux, even though they had nothing to do with the U.S.-Dakota War in southern Minnesota.


  It was there, near Dead Buffalo Lake, that Sitting Bull's legend began. In the summer of 1863 he and other Sioux warriors battled briefly with Sibley's forces. Sitting Bull, armed with only a whip, was said to have "counted coup" during the battle with the Army. "Counting coup" was the highest honor earned by warriors in the Great Plains wars.


  Sitting Bull, along with Crazy Horse, became battle-hardened leaders in the coming years as the Great Plains battles continued. After the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn — George Custer's last stand — the fates of the two chiefs were sealed. Crazy Horse was killed by an Army solider a year later and Sitting Bull was forced to flee to Canada. He and his people returned in 1881, surrendering in exchange for amnesty.


  For the next nine years, until his death, Sitting Bull was a Western American icon. While he was visiting St. Paul, he attended a performance by Annie Oakley and was mesmerized by her marksmanship.


  Oakley went to meet Sitting Bull the next day and they became fast friends. “He insisted upon adopting me, and I was then and there christened ‘Watanya Cicilla,’ or ‘Little Sure Shot,’” Oakley later wrote.


  Sitting Bull also reportedly gave her a pair of moccasins he had worn at Little Bighorn. The next year Sitting Bull joined Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show for a four-month stint.

  Those leading the march carried a banner reading Justice for Jacob as they made their way toward the Kenosha County Courthouse, where members of Mr. Blake’s family, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore and other community leaders were expected to speak.


  We are heartbroken and enraged, but we are steadfast in our demand for justice, Tanya Mclean, a Mr. Blake family friend who helped organize the event, said in a statement. She said Mr. Blake’s shooting is not an isolated incident, but part of a brutal, racist system.


  We’re here to demand an end to police violence and systemic racism in Kenosha, Mr. Mclean said.


  No more piecemeal reforms and useless committees. No more Band-Aid solutions over the bullet wounds. The time for transformational change is now.


  Kenosha Police Officer Rusten Sheskey and two other officers were responding to a domestic abuse call on Sunday when Sheskey shot Mr. Blake seven times in the back.


  Mr. Blake is paralyzed from the shooting, his family said, and is recovering in a Milwaukee hospital.


  The shooting, which was captured on cellphone video, sparked new protests against racial injustice and police brutality, just three months after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police touched off a wider reckoning on race.


  Protesters have marched on Kenosha’s streets every night since, early in the week devolving into unrest with damage to buildings and vehicles.


  On Tuesday, two people were killed by an armed civilian. The commander of the National Guard said Friday that more than 1,000 Guard members had been deployed to help keep the peace, and more were on the way.


  Aniyah Ervin, a 16-year-old from Kenosha who is black, said Saturday that the week has been surreal.


  Although she is part of a group that held protests against racial injustice over the summer, she said there had been a feeling that police brutality was not a problem in their community, which teenagers call Ke - Nowhere.


  Ms. Ervin said the shooting of Mr. Blake shows it can happen anywhere.


  Will Turner, who is black, said he brought his two children from Madison for the march show them the power of peaceful protesting.


  Investigators have said little about what led to Mr. Blake’s shooting.


  The Kenosha police union said Mr. Blake had a knife and fought with officers, putting one of them in a headlock as two efforts to stun him with a taser were unsuccessful. State investigators have said only that officers found a knife on the floor of the car.


  In the cellphone footage recorded by a bystander, Mr. Blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of an SUV to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns drawn and shout at him.


  As Mr. Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire. Three of Mr. Blake’s children were in the vehicle.


  The man who recorded the video, 22-year-old Raysean White, said he heard police yell at Mr. Blake, Drop the knife! Drop the knife! before gunfire erupted. Mr. White said he didn’t see a knife in Mr. Blake’s hands.


  Ben Crump, an attorney for Mr. Blake’s family, has said Mr. Blake did nothing to provoke police and has called for Sheskey’s arrest and the firing of the two other officers.

We all know sunflowers (helianthus), as they are one of the most recognizable flowers. Their brilliant color and rustic charm endear them to young and old, gardener and painter. They grace gardens and fields, blooming in the latter part of the summer. Those tall stalks not only beg our attention, but they also attract birds, butterflies and bees. I will always remember driving on a back road near Baltimore and coming across a breath-taking sight of sunflowers. The countryside was glowing with these bright, canary-yellow flowers that embellished the road for a long way. I have read and seen pictures of the fields in Italy, where you see sunflowers for miles, and I felt I was experiencing that sight.      Each August, I ask my son Will to let me know when his field of sunflowers is blooming. I like to go and just enjoy the site and to pick some for the house. I am always curious which way they will be facing when I visit his field. It is fun to watch the young flowers turn eastward at dawn to greet the sun. Then, as the sun starts to rise above the horizon, these charming flowers begin their romance with the sun as they follow it across the sky. By sunset time, they will be facing west to watch the sun disappear into the horizon. Then by morning, they are all facing east again and are ready to start again.      Sunflowers come in many different colors and sizes. There are the tall ones that come to mind when someone mentions sunflowers. There are also medium- sized ones that grow to about 4 or 5 feet. Today, you can even get dwarf varieties that are quite charming, only growing to about 2 feet tall. Their colors have a wide range of hues too, going from brilliant yellow to rust, brown and amber and shades in-between.      There are also sunflowers that are continuous bloomers. This spring, I was visiting nurseries as I usually do, mask on and keeping a distance of course; I was introduced to some new plants as I roamed the isles. I always want to see what the different garden centers bring in to sell and to see which plants are the most popular.      On my ventures to nurseries, two new annual sunflowers caught my attention. The first one was named SunBelievable or Brown Eyed Girl Helianthus. It has the happy face of a sunflower with multi-branching and dwarf in size. SunBelievable has golden yellow petals that become reddish-brown towards the base and they blend well into a dark brown center. This plant does not produce seed, putting all of its energy into making a constant crop of flowers. They are cheerful looking in the container and I was told that they bloomed all summer long. I was keen to give this plant a try.      When I purchased them, they had a few blooms and I assumed as the plant grew, I would see more. They have looked nice all summer, but now they are about to explode with even more blooms. I was content with the number I was getting, but in a week, I will have a bush with even more flowers covering the plant at a time when other flowers are starting to fade.      Shortly after finding SunBelievable, I was visiting another nursery and I spotted another dwarf sunflower that was bright, clear yellow. It was named Sunfinity. This plant was about 18 inches tall with yellow, daisy-looking flowers that were quite cheerful looking. This plant was developed to give the home gardener colorful, long-lasting sunflower looking blooms that are smaller and bloom over several months. Sunfinity was created to have many stems with a multitude of blooms to flower all season long. This was a unique and different way to look at sunflowers.   They do not have the large heads of what I think of as traditional sunflowers - the bloom is only about 3 inches wide. However, the number of blooms and the length of time they have flowers make up for the size.      There are companies that specialize in all the new and exciting sunflowers and catalogs to tempt you. You can save your seeds, but remember that cross- pollination could have occurred and you might not get a flower that is exactly like the one you collected seed from. It is best to purchase new fresh seeds each year if you want a particular looking sunflower. Sunflowers are a joy to grow, and I hope I always have some to greet the morning and to brighten the countryside.

It was a mixed bag during today's 98-play scrimmage inside Milan Puskar Stadium, according to coach Neal Brown. "There was a lot of give and take," he said following today's two-hour-plus work that included a late start because of a morning rain shower. "I thought the defense started off strong and forced some takeaways, a fumble and two interceptions. "Then the offense right around the middle rebounded and really ran the ball better and did some really nice things toward the middle of the scrimmage." That's when it put together a 98-yard drive that ended in the end zone when quarterback Jarret Doege connected with Winston Wright Jr. on a 26-yard touchdown pass. The big play was Leddie Brown's 38-yard burst up the middle of the field to take the ball to midfield. The junior led all ball carriers with 43 yards on just four carries. The No. 3 offense, with true freshman quarterback Garrett Greene under center, had two impressive long drives for touchdowns. Greene worked his magic in and out of the pocket completing passes downfield to Middle Tennessee transfer Zack Dobson, who caught four passes for a scrimmage-best 93 yards, including a 26-yard touchdown.

SpaceX initially planned to launch SAOCOM 1B from Vandenberg, but sought permission to move the flight to Cape Canaveral to ease ground processing issues.


  The company presumably won government approval for the move in part because of the dogleg maneuver, which minimizes overflight of populated areas, the rocket's high altitude by the time it reaches populated areas farther downrange and because the Falcon 9 features an automated flight safety system. The AFTS is designed to quickly terminate a flight if an impending catastrophic problem is detected.


  The 6,720-pound SAOCOM 1B requires a polar orbit to enable its cloud- penetrating radar to observe the entire planet as it rotates below. The spacecraft will work in concert with an identical L-band radar mapper launched in 2018 along with Italy's COSMO-SkyMed X-band satellites.


  Bound for a 360-mile-high orbit, the $600 million SOACOM system is designed to monitor soil moisture and a range of other factors affecting the agricultural sector, collecting high-resolution data around the clock regardless of cloud cover.


  "One of the main targets of the SAOCOM satellites is to provide information for the agriculture sector," Raul Kulichevsky, executive and technical director of CONAE, Argentina's space agency, told Spaceflight Now.


  "One of the things we develop is soil moisture maps, not only of the surface, but taking advantage of the L-band capabilities we can measure the soil moisture 1 meter below the surface of the land. So this is very important information."

Chase Nixon's athletic journey has never been a normal one. The son of Trot Nixon, a two-time World Series champion with the Boston Red Sox, Chase had to wait for his time in the spotlight with both the New Hanover football and baseball teams.


   


  But when he finally got his chance, Chase exceeded expectations. He led the Wildcats to a Mideastern Conference title and a spot in the Eat Regional Final as the starting quarterback in 2019. He was poised for even bigger things on the diamond in the spring.


   


  COVID-19 had other ideas, canceling Chase's senior baseball season and throwing a curveball at his collegiate plans.


   


  "I felt like I was Power Five-ready, but I just wasn't getting the looks and lost any chance at showcasing myself senior year," he said.


    "   From Scoreboard to Inbox: Sign up today for our free weekly StarNewsVarsity email newsletter.   "  


  So the abnormal journey continues. After graduating from New Hanover, Chase enrolled at the Pro 5 Baseball Academy in Holly Springs this fall. He joins Cape Fear Academy's Trey Clucas, Laney's Grayson Irwin and Coastal Christian's Nathan Keeter as Wilmington baseball players at Pro 5.


   


  Chase hopes to turn one year at Pro 5 into a Division I scholarship, or enroll at a junior college so he can be eligible for the MLB draft if he gets enough positive reviews from scouts and coaches.


   


  "He was going to be a monster for us his senior season," interim New Hanover baseball coach Scott Sandlin said. "He was doing things in practice you hadn't seen from Chase before. He was emotionally and mentally more mature, and he's going to be a monster at Pro 5 and wherever he plays down the road."


   


  COVID did more than stop Chase's senior baseball season, according to Sandlin. With seniors in college gaining an extra year of eligibility, freshmen redshirting after the shortened 2020 season and no opportunities to visit college campuses, Chase's options were limited.


   


  But the dedication to baseball at Pro 5 appealed to Chase. He had offers to play at Barton and USC-Aiken -- a pair of strong Division II programs -- but decided to bet on himself and his hopes of playing at a higher level in the spring of 2022.


   


  At Pro 5, Chase gets three hours of practice every day. The afternoons are filled with weightlifting and school work. He's taking online classes at Cape Fear Community College while living in the Holly Springs area.


   


  "My swing is coming along really well, and it's going to be all about getting bigger, faster and stronger while I'm here," Chase said. "The coaches here are great about making sure you have the right intensity with everything you do."


   


  Chase laughs when talking about his legacy at New Hanover. He was never the best player -- Blake Walston, Kyle Smith and Jac Croom stole the headlines in the Wildcats' two-year romp across the 3A classification.


   


  Instead, he is mostly remembered for his work with the football team last fall. He helped the Wildcats reclaim the Mideastern Conference title and end a two-game losing streak to Hoggard.


   


  Still, he points to his experiences at Buck Hardee field as his fondest memories in orange and black.


   


  "Those years coming up, I learned a lot about myself," he said. "People just didn't really know me with all the talent we had on the baseball team, and there were times I wanted to give up. But I look back and I kept pushing, and that's exactly what I'm going to keep doing as long as I'm playing."

RICHMOND—Gov. Ralph Northam kicked off the Commonwealth’s 19th annual Checkpoint Strikeforce enforcement and public education campaign Wednesday to combat impaired driving and prevent alcohol-related injuries and fatalities on Virginia’s roads.


  Modified to address safety and health concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the period of increased enforcement will take place through Labor Day weekend, and resume periodically around key holidays like Halloween, Thanksgiving, and New Year’s Eve.


  “This has been a challenging year, and now more than ever, we are all focused on keeping our loved ones safe,” said Northam. “I am asking Virginians to apply the same collective action and shared responsibility that we have harnessed to stop the spread of COVID-19 to reverse the trends of drunk driving. The work of Checkpoint Strikeforce is a critical part of our efforts to reduce the number of fatalities on Virginia’s roads, and the message is simple: if you are old enough to drink, act like it—never get behind the wheel after you have been drinking.”


  Last year, 31.9% of traffic fatalities in Virginia were due to alcohol- related crashes, and 18,648 people were convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in the Commonwealth. During Labor Day weekend alone, Virginia State Police personnel arrested 76 drunk drivers, averaging a DUI arrest every 75 minutes. Checkpoint Strikeforce is a crucial joint effort between public and private partners that works to stop these fatalities through surround- sound persuasion campaigning and high-visibility enforcement that reminds Virginians to get a safe ride after drinking or face arrest.

  There were profits to be made on each side of the triangle. In the 18th Century a "strong and able" slave could sell for more than £100 - that's £11,000 in today's money. Young women were valued because they could produce more slaves.


  The final leg of the journey saw the ships return to Scotland laden with more high profit goods such as sugar, rum and tobacco.

"The common thought is there is going to be a rush of cases filed once the federal stimulus package stops," said Todd Griffee, another bankruptcy attorney in St. Joseph. "People, we think, have been living off credit card debt for necessities like food and clothing."


  Briles said many of the consumer relief measures at the height of the pandemic granted moratoriums on making payments on utility bills, rent or mortgages. But they didn't extend the loan or modify the terms, even if the consumer is behind on payments. That means the bill, quite possibly a big one, is about to come due.


  "It's kind of kicking the can down the road a little bit," Briles said. "Unfortunately, it can seem worse than ever when you finally get to the end of that road."


  Briles has seen spikes in bankruptcies before, most recently immediately following the 2008 recession. Bankruptcy filings can track home foreclosures closely, with debtors seeking Chapter 13 restructuring in order to hold on to a house. The mortgage analytics company CoreLogic found that 7% of home mortgages were delinquent in May, the highest rate since 2014.


  The rates of foreclosures and delinquencies can vary from market to market, but many homeowners are experiencing similar pressures.


  "Whether it's three months from now or six months from now, I think it's going to catch up with people who are out of work and falling behind on mortgages and other payments," Briles said.


  Griffee said bankruptcies are cyclical, meaning that a significant surge in filings might not happen until spring, which tends to be the busy season.


  "Filings are up substantially in March, April and May," he said. "People are getting their tax refunds back and recovering from Christmas."

The post in Valeurs Actuelles, entitled "Danièle Obono in the Age of Slavery," is an imaginary account of Obono's go back to 18th century Africa, triggering criticism from throughout the French political class.


  The story consists of illustrations revealing the left-wing member of the National Assembly with chains around her neck. Obono, who is of French- Gabonese origin, required to Twitter Friday to reveal her discouragement at what she called "racist shit." Obono mentioned that "it appears that we can no longer say anything."


  "Fortunately we can still write racist shit in a rag, illustrated by the images of a black French African deputy painted as a slave." Her remarks were accompanied by the image.


  Valeurs Actuelles at first reacted to Obono's remarks on Twitter, stating: "Racist shit? It's a fictional story setting the scene of the horrors of slavery organised by the Africans in the 18th century."


  Speaking to French TELEVISION station BFMTV Saturday, the magazine's deputy editor Tugdual Denis stated the publication comprehended "the symbolic charge" of the image illustratingObono Denis stated he "personally" used an apology to Obono, stating he was sorry for that "it could have been thought that we are racist."

We’re in war and immigrants are on the frontlines. Along with leading our small businesses, staffing our supermarkets, they’re taking care of our family in hospitals and serve as the backbone for research and development for medical breakthroughs – which will include the future COVID-19 vaccine.


  To ensure our economy stays open and that America wins the global vaccine race, we must do more to protect our immigrants through inclusive policies rather than harmful ones. Instead of recognizing immigrant contributions to our country, President Trump restricted entry of many foreign workers and immigrants seeking green cards for permanent residency in June, claiming these moves would protect workers amid the downturn. This is simply untrue.


  During the pandemic, many essential businesses and restaurants boost our economy and provide key services for you and your family. In fact, nearly half of all immigrant-owned startups nationwide are in food, retail, accommodation and services.


  According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants make up 10% of Georgia’s population, they sparked “$1.8 billion in business revenue and over 88,290 immigrant businesses accounted for 17% of all self-employed Georgia residents in 2018.” This means immigrants generate jobs. Targeting immigrants during this pandemic, which has seen the largest drop in business owners on record by 3.3 million in March and April, reduces jobs and doesn’t grow opportunities. There is such concern that this will damage our communities that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is suing the administration for fear that these restrictions will outsource jobs and halt growth.


  And what about our hospitals? Even before COVID-19, 17% of Georgia’s doctors were foreign-born, helping to fill the growing physician shortage that is expected to skyrocket above 120,000 by 2030. This gap is even more obvious in rural Georgia, where nine counties have zero doctors and 60 counties are without a single pediatrician. According to the Association of Rural Hospitals, rural Georgia has a higher percentage of immigrant doctors than cities, but we need more of the world’s doctors in rural Georgia — not less — to protect our most vulnerable. And this is before COVID-19.

New Nixa coach John Perry has brought the Eagles dynamic offensive play- calling, daring trick plays and a defense dunk.


  Dunks by Nixa defenders were celebrated whole-heartedly Friday during the Eagles’ 42-6 blowout of Branson. With each Pirates turnover, and there were four of them, came a dunk of a football into a trash can along the Nixa sideline.


  The concept is unique in these parts, but has been a fixture in northern Mississippi in Perry’s hometown of Pearl.


  “We did that in Pearl and our kids loved it. So, that was something I told (defensive coordinator Phil Wickwar) about and I said to him, ‘At least think about it.’ He finally pulled the trigger on it,” Perry said. “Think about it, some of the biggest plays in football are turnovers. To celebrate a turnover along your sideline like that is awesome. If a kid tries a little extra hard to get a fumble or interception because he wants to dunk a football along the sideline, I’m all for it. This ought to be a fun sport and I thought our kids had fun tonight.”


  Cornerback Ben Mills had a bit too much fun during his dunk, following an interception on Branson’s opening offensive possession.


  “I liked the dunk but wasn’t really ready for it,” Mills said. “The ball came to me really fast and I dunked it and hurt my forearm. I dunked a little too hard and hit my arm on the trash can. But it’s OK.”


  Safety Riley Childs dunked twice following two fumble recoveries and defensive end Dylan Nelson had a mighty dunk after he intercepted a Branson pass and rumbled 15 yards for a touchdown.


  “When our defense runs off the field for a celebratory dunk, everybody gets into it and is crazy,” Nelson said. “It’s something that is going to be a tradition at Nixa now.”


  Nelson initially appeared that he would be celebrating a quarterback sack. As he burst through the Branson offensive line and approached the quarterback, the ball slipped through the hands of the signal-caller and into Nelson’s hands.


  “The quarterback just whiffed the ball and I happened to be there,” Nelson said. “I saw the opportunity and took it and ran with it. It was luck of the draw.”


  Nelson had a clear path to the end zone, but nearly didn’t make it as he almost lost his balance.


  “I had bad cramps all night. It was all I could do to power through the cramps,” Nelson said. “I saw the goal-line and I breathed a sigh of relief and thought, ‘Four years and this just happened.’ I was ecstatic. To come out of the gates like that is crazy.”


  Mills made his first varsity start memorable. In addition to his pick, he had a lockdown effort against Branson wideout Brady Blackwell, who the Pirates hyped in the pre-season as one of the best receivers in the COC.


  Blackwell had a 13-yard touchdown catch in the final seconds against Nixa backups, but couldn’t shake Mills all night.


  “I thought he was going to be harder to defend than he was. But he wasn’t as hard as I thought he was going to be. I thought I covered him pretty well,” Mills said. “The main thing was to look at his hips, don’t lose him from his hips. His hips don’t lie about where he’s going.”


  Mills felt Branson coaches were looking to throw his way from the start.


  “I didn’t have the best jamboree, so they probably saw that and were trying to go my way,” Mills said. “Tonight, I was trying to show everybody what I could do. This means a lot to me. I hope this shows the coaches they can have faith in me.”


  Perry and his staff have actually been pleased with Mills all summer. Mills is a newcomer in the secondary alongside established standouts Clayton Uber and Kolyn Eli.


  “Ben has been the surprise of the whole deal,” Perry said. “He was the one (defensive back) that when everything kicked off everyone had a question mark about him. But he has been rock-solid since day one.”

School boards face a difficult challenge as they consider when and how to open schools for in-person classes. As a physician, I agree with those public health districts that have made the assessment that there is an excessive level of community spread such that schools should not hold classes on campus, but rather remotely. However, I agree that physicians are not and should not be making the reopening decisions for schools.


  However, once schools determine that they are going to open, I wish they would consult with physicians and public health experts to review and, as Dr. Jim Souza calls it, “stress test” their operational plans. If the decision is made to proceed with reopening, even if that is not the decision that us physicians would make, at least let us help you make sure you are the best prepared you possibly can be for the challenges schools will inevitably face.


  I advised one school’s leaders by Zoom to review their plan with them and just ask questions — how are you going to handle this situation and what will you do if this occurs? Although these leaders had been very thoughtful and actually had a very well-developed plan, school leaders are not usually doctors or public health experts, and there are things they did not think about. This gave these leaders a chance to close those gaps and strengthen their plan before opening. As I have said before, planning to open is the easy part. The tough part is the ongoing operational plan that gives you the best shot at remaining open.

BOSTON -- Kevin Pillar posted a two-minute video clip to his personal Twitter account Saturday addressing the self-described "terrible job" he did speaking with the media in the wake of this week's postponed game between the Red Sox and Blue Jays.


  Pillar said declining to play Thursday was "not an easy decision for a lot of us" and confirmed Boston was not unanimous in opting not to take the field for the finale of the three-game series. The Red Sox ultimately supported center fielder Jackie Bradley Jr., who told teammates and coaching staff members he would not be in the lineup that night. Bradley and several fellow Black players throughout the league withheld their services in protest of social injustice and racial inequality, and a combined 10 games were called off Wednesday and Thursday.


  "I did a terrible job of expressing to the media the other day regarding our team's decision to not play," Pillar said from the Fenway Park grandstand. "Not only to support Jackie and his decision, but because of the reoccurring, senseless acts of police brutality toward Black people in this country.


  "I was speaking on behalf of my experiences, especially growing up around baseball and in sports in general. I don't view the world how the world views it, and that's ignorant of me."


  Bradley is the lone Black player on the current Boston roster, and the club is one of 14 teams in Major League Baseball with two or fewer Black players on their respective rosters. Black players accounted for just 7.8% of roster spots on Opening Day, continuing a steady decline over the past three decades.


  "Is it more important that we uplift Jackie because he's the only one? My answer would be no," Pillar said Thursday. "… To answer your question, it's a complicated, touchy subject, but I don't think right now as a country we should necessarily be identifying individual groups of people that need to be uplifted. I think the mass majority of us would like to encourage and uplift everyone and support everyone."


  Pillar's answer infringed on the territory occupied by conservative All Lives Matter pundits, who seek to repudiate and discredit the initiative adopted by the Red Sox in 2020. Boston has displayed Black Lives Matter banners both in the outfield bleachers and along a billboard space above the Mass Pike outside the ballpark. Bradley was one of a host of Black players throughout the game who filmed a preseason public service announcement on behalf of a league-wide effort to support BLM.


  "Black lives do matter to me -- always have and always will," Pillar said. "I am sorry for not using my opportunity -- my platform -- to have spoken up about the injustices that we are seeing day in and day out across this country. For that I am sorry.


  "I will continue to speak up for not only what is right, but also in what I truly believe in. And that is equality for all, making this country free of injustices, equal opportunities and accountability for our actions."


  Stretched rotation


  With Nathan Eovaldi (right calf strain) on the injured list and Martin Perez battling a blister on his left index finger, the Red Sox rotation appears stretched to the limit.


  Chris Mazza was recalled from the alternate site at Pawtucket to start Saturday's game against the Nationals. Zack Godley and Colten Brewer will take the ball Sunday and Monday, respectively. Boston has yet to decide who will start Tuesday's game against at Atlanta.


  "Tuesday we're still talking about," Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. "Trying to figure out -- it could be (Kyle) Hart. We're trying to figure out exactly what we're doing there."


  Boston starters entered Saturday with a 6.66 earned run average. Hart has posted a 13.00 ERA through three outings and might not receive a fourth chance in the near future. The Red Sox would seem to have few other places to turn with Chris Sale (left elbow) and Eduardo Rodriguez (heart) already sidelined for the rest of 2020.


  Boston is unlikely to activate any of its premium prospects working at McCoy Stadium. The Red Sox are also holding back on promoting right-hander Nick Pivetta, who was optioned to the alternate site after being acquired in a trade with the Phillies last week. Pivetta has 92 appearances in the big leagues to his credit, including 71 starts.


  "We had discussions about that," Roenicke said. (Chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom) actually drove out to Pawtucket a couple days ago to talk to him and kind of feel out where we should be with him and when we should have him come up and pitch for us -- if he's going to pitch for us."


  There could be more than readiness at play concerning when Boston ultimately recalls Pivetta. A certain number of days in the big leagues this season would make the 27-year-old eligible for arbitration in 2021. Failing to reach that number would push Pivetta's first arbitration year back to 2022 and delay his eventual free agency until 2025.


  Sweet company


  Rafael Devers wasn't quite sure why his teammates were celebrating a bit more than usual on his RBI double Friday night.


  Someone clued in the Red Sox third baseman after the fact. The two-base hit to right-center field was the 100th of his career, the latest milestone for Devers in what ultimately was a 10-2 loss to the Nationals.


  Devers is now one of just four Boston players to reach 100 doubles before his 24th birthday. The others are names any fan would almost certainly recognize -- Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr and Carl Yastrzemski.


  "I'm extremely proud of being mentioned with those guys," Devers said. "Those guys are big-time in the sport, and they've done a lot of things. I'm just proud of where I am at this point and where I continue to progress."


  Bryce Harper, Manny Machado and Mike Trout were the last three big leaguers to reach the century mark by the same age. Devers also rubbed elbows with several of the game's greats during his breakout 2019 season. Joe DiMaggio and Alex Rodriguez are the only other players to total as many as 90 extra-base hits before turning 23, a number Devers hit on the nose.

When "The Bootlegger" appeared, in 1998, I was pleased to bring to public attention a woman who had been forgotten, three generations after her notable public career: Harriet (Hattie) Polk. After all, in 1923, just a few years after American women had finally achieved voting rights, she was elected Mayor of Colchester. And she was the only female mayor in Illinois.


   


  She was indispensable to the Kelly Wagle story because, for a couple of years, she was the latter's chief opponent, determined to stop the noted lawbreaker who had arisen in her town.


   


  As I mentioned in the book, Hattie was "deeply rooted in the anti-liquor campaign." Her father, George Welch, was a pioneer farmer living north of town, and he was a non-drinker throughout his life. Likewise, her mother, Margaret Welch, was a long-time member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. It is not surprising that by the early 1920s Hattie, who was then in her late forties, was president of that local WCTU organization.


   


  As that shows, too, much female civic activism was sparked by their crusade to stop the drunken behavior that had characterized the experience of men. And male relationships in a small town had a huge negative impact on law enforcement. As I said in "The Bootlegger,"


   


  "Most of the men in town had known each other forever--had played baseball and marbles together, had worked with or for each other, or had been 'brothers' in a fraternal order. They depended on one another for business support, they swapped stories at the pool hall and the barber shop, and they knew each other on a nickname basis. Consequently, it was hard to find officials who would strive to arrest or prosecute the bootleggers. In fact, many would help an arrested friend beat the charge."


   


  So, Hattie had to contend with the good-buddy system of local men, which often prevented effective law enforcement. And she also struggled with combining the duties of a housewife with the responsibilities of a mayor, so gender bias was negative in that way, too.


   


  Because she was something of a statewide celebrity, she was soon invited to address the Illinois League of Women Voters in Chicago, and in that speech she discussed the challenge of having a hard, busy, full-time public job--in a culture that nevertheless expected her to continue laboring as a housewife. As many newspapers reported in November, 1923,


   


  "Mrs. Harriet Polk of Colchester, Ill., the only woman mayor in the state, admitted in Chicago this week, where she spoke before the League of Women voters, that being a mayor was 'a man's job.' Despite that, she said that since she went into office six months ago Colchester has been considerably 'cleaned up'--and that, at the same time, she had held down her woman's job as a cook and housekeeper.


   


  'I haven't hired a penny's worth of work done [at home],' said the woman mayor, a frail but rigidly erect little figure, in a plain brown frock, with her graying hair showing beneath an uncompromisingly straight-brimmed hat. 'I do my own housework, my own cooking, my own cleaning and washing and ironing. But probably the toughest job of all--even worse than getting our worst bootlegger [Kelly Wagle] indicted--was convincing my husband that it wasn't a disgrace [for him] to have a mayor for a wife.'. . ."


   


  Of course, she was referring to the traditional notion that a husband was supposed to lead, to dominate, and to be more engaged with the public. And so Edmond Polk--who was simply a popular employee at the Terrill and Hulson Store, had to reconcile himself to being less prominent and authoritative than his wife.


   


  And of course, that traditional secondary status for women made handling the mayor's job harder, too. As Hattie said later in her speech, "'You might call being a mayor just housekeeping on a larger scale,' she admitted, 'but in my house I have the right of way--and I ought to [as well] in a public office; yet I haven't though,' she added."


   


  As that reveals, Mayor Hattie Polk had to contend with male attitudes-- including the notion that a woman shouldn't be the boss, telling men what to do. So, she had to struggle to have her way against men. She even added, as an example, "It's taken me weeks to get rid of one of our prominent officials, who was drunk all the time, but we've finally done it. . . ."


   


  Of course, such efforts on Hattie's part, although effective in "cleaning up the town," prompted opposition from some men, who felt diminished by the determined, assertive female leader. I didn't discuss her personal struggle in "The Bootlegger," but I did mention that the difficulty of getting male support for her efforts to eradicate lawbreaking fostered cooperation between the embattled mayor and the local Ku Klux Klan--a church-based group that was also opposed to bootlegging. When the hooded Klansmen officially visited local schools, to present them with a Bible and a U. S. flag, Hattie was asked to accompany them--to make "a short talk on the Bible and the flag." (Of course, she was not a member of that all-male group.)


   


  As that reveals, she was committed to helping her townspeople bring up local youngsters to be "Decent and Wholesome," with respect "for Law and Order, and for the Bible"--as a 1925 political pamphlet for her re-election pointed out. And in that effort she had the firm support of all four of the town's ministers--"who viewed Hattie Polk as the champion of decency against the forces of corruption and immorality."


   


  But the Klan was, of course, a controversial group. They did sometimes deal in intimidation, burning crosses on the property of suspected bootleggers, for example. So, Hattie got caught up in local controversy between those two male groups--bootleggers and Klansmen. As I mention in "The Bootlegger," during the 1925 election, "Accusations about bootlegging, drinking, intimidation, corruption, and the Klan were hurled back and forth by Polk supporters and Polk opponents, at meetings and rallies, as the town's smoldering animosities suddenly flamed and burned."


   


  As a result of that, and gender bias, Hattie lost her 1925 bid for re- election, to a man--a store owner who was a drinker, and who was not going to be tough on local bootleggers.


   


  Discouraged, Hattie remained in Colchester for a couple of years, and was active in the WCTU, but crime increased and bootleggers prospered. She and her husband eventually moved to Macomb, in 1927, where Edmond opened a store on South Dudley Street. He died at the close of 1928, and Hattie remained in Macomb until the early 1950s, when she went to live with a daughter in Des Moines. After that daughter suddenly died, Hattie returned to Colchester, where she died in 1955. She was buried beside her husband in Colchester's Mt. Auburn Cemetery.


   


  Although her obituary mentioned that she had served as mayor during the 1920s, it did not provide any details--or even state that, back then, no other woman in Illinois held such a public leadership position. Nor has her achievement been memorialized. In any case, as this brief discussion shows, every aspect of Hattie Polk's groundbreaking role was a struggle against the gender prejudice that deeply impacted the lives of women. (And their struggle continues.)
