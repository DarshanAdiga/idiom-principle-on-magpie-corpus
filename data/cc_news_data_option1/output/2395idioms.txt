Back in February, the center’s executive director, Bob Goodrum, had said that this transition to permanent supportive housing is something sorely needed for those making minimal income. Residents will pay only 30 percent of their income for their rent with the difference being made up through vouchers.
 “And then the rest of the money you have to make a life with,” Goodrum said in February. “Not much of one, let’s be honest. I mean, you’re talking less than $500 a month to cover car insurance, gas, clothing.”
 Whereas before there was a two-year limit on the amount of time residents could live in these units, there is now no clear termination of the lease. Before these renovations, nine of the 13 units only had one bedroom, which is not ideal for a family living situation.
 “Which, when you’re talking about families, one bedrooms and families, they don’t go well together,” he said.
 Now, the smallest units have two bedrooms while the larger go all the way up to four. The tenants for these units qualify based on their income as well as if they have a prevailing disability, be it physical, emotional or even chemical-dependency.

There’s a health screening, which includes a temperature check and questionnaire, every athlete has to pass before they can enter the team’s facility. There’s a setup to their workouts that’s different from what the Ball State football players would have seen even just a year ago, because of the safety guidelines everyone with the program is doing what they can to follow so the phased return of its entire department can continue. But progress is occurring.
 Todd described everyone’s mindset as “itching to get back.” Slaven would say “earlier is better than never,” considering the fact he’d heard BSU football coach Mike Neu talking about the potential for only four, five or six weeks before the season to prepare, not to mention offensive line coach and running game coordinator Colin Johnson discussing the possibility of a spring season. And Martin said there’s nothing like being around the team again.
 “Being back with the guys,” Martin said, “I think it just brings a totally different dynamic to working out.”
 Added Todd: “It was not only a stress reliever but a motivator, because I’m not going to lie there were days — you get used to waking up and coming to (Scheumann Stadium) every day. That’s your home away from home. You spend so much time there. We spend so much time there. You become so comfortable with it.”
 Todd estimates he heard about 10 different people say “it feels so good to be back, this is awesome,” over the course of that first day. It’s a sentiment that very likely could be repeated by those who come back to campus in the following phases, freshman linebacker Keionté Newson tweeting Tuesday in part, “wish (I) was with y’all.”
 As that accumulation of athletes takes place, should everything continue safely, Todd hopes to learn more about how things will look this fall as society begins to open up more. Being an offensive linemen, he’s used to practicing “face-to-face” and “down and dirty” in drills where he’s trying “to overpower this man.” and given the current rules he can’t actually block anyone yet.

Where was I?
 Oh yeah — technology bad, Mother Nature good.
 During one of our drives to Townsend, through Wears Valley, my daughter asked my wife and I “Is this God?”
 I can’t remember if I responded to that question, I know my wife did, but in my head I know I thought to myself, “Yes, this is God.”
 When you go into a big city and see magnificent buildings and pieces of art, human creates all those.
 Yeah, there is certainly some type of divine intervention, but at the end of the day a person creates it.
 But the natural world like the sound of water rippling over rocks in a stream, the clouds casting shadows on the mountains, those are all the creations of God — no man or woman can create such beauty in my opinion.
 I guess maybe that is why traveling to the Smoky Mountains gave myself, and my family, some much needed respite.
 It was a time that we could all just sit back for a few hours and enjoy the creation of God, and the gifts he has given us.
 Like many families, it has become a tradition with my little family to make grab a photo at the sign that you see as you enter the park from the Gatlinburg side.

 The nearly three-month shutdown of fitness centres in view of the COVID-19 pandemic has left the industry high and dry with some gyms contemplating closure while some have even laid off several trainers.
 Over 75 days have passed since they last closed the shutters on their gyms and the owners are unable to take on the increasing pressure to meet the expenses. While salaries were paid to trainers for the month of March, some paid them half a month’s salary for April but are unable to afford them without any revenue, they said.
 Along with electricity bills, hefty rent amounts gym owners also have pending loans, says Vignesh Ramanathan, owner, Define Fitness Centre in Thillai Nagar.
 Seven staff members, including trainers were asked to leave at his gym and he continues to pay rent for the gym from his own savings, he said.
 “Along with the rent, the equipment in the gym is purchased on loan. These loans have to be paid off and cannot be deferred,” he said.
 K. Hemajothi, who runs an all-women gym near Chathram Bus Stand, said that along with the financial burden of paying off these debts, she worries about her customers. “Most women who trained at our gym found solace here. That one hour in a day would be a stress-buster, free from work, from family and all other commitments. During the lockdown, many of them have become stressed and anxious and are yearning to return to the gym,” she said.
 While many gyms continue to provide online classes and workouts, equipments are languishing in locked gyms. “Just like how cars need to be regularly used to be in good condition, some equipment needs to be used. Initially we contemplated going and switching them on and off but fearing action from authorities, we have kept the gyms closed,” another gym owner in Woraiyur said.
 A group of owners plan to petition the district collector to allow for them to reopen their centres. “When salons can open, we can too. We will reduce the number of people per session and will ensure all norms are followed,” Mr. Vignesh said. Reopening gyms will only increase immunity and help people fight against the deadly virus. “The city corporation and health officials can provide standard operating procedures which we will ensure and will also sanitise the equipment regularly,” he added.

 Visitors to the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument near Las Cruces, New Mexico, will get the feel of being on top of the world hiking up trails offering beautiful views.
 This angular granite mountain range's rocky spires stand almost 9,000 feet tall against the Chihuahuan Desert floor. The peaks include the Robledo Mountains, Sierra de las Uvas, Portrillo Mountains and Doña Ana Mountains. Hikers will find narrow canyons mixed with open woodlands. From the desert to the ponderosa pines in the highest elevations, the land offers many opportunities for visitors from photography to horseback riding and mountain biking, camping, hiking and wildlife viewing.
 The Portrillo Mountains stand as the most remote section of the Monument. The area is southwest of Las Cruces and known for its volcanic landscape including cinder cones, lava flows and craters. The Doña Ana Mountains is a pedestrian, equestrian and biker's paradise. Rock climbing routes and even some motorized use areas can take visitors to some of the higher elevations. Bird watching, backpacking, camping, hunting and fishing opportunities are plentiful.
 The park was established May 21, 2014, and consists of 496,330 acres. The Dripping Springs Visitors Center on the western edge of the Organ Mountains is open all year, except winter holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Dripping Springs Natural Area is an opportunity for visitors to take a great hike with beautiful views of the Rio Grande River and Mesilla Valley. Trails offer easy to moderate hikes and are scenic with wildlife. The path is gravel, so good closed toes shoes are best. If you can walk two miles at 5,000 feet, you can do this hike. There are shaded benches along the way.
 This national monument not only provides a variety of things to do for travelers but also protects prehistoric, historic, geologic and biologic resources. These scientific resources are divided onto the four mountain areas.
 Just northwest of Las Cruces, the canyons and Chihuahuan Desert grasslands offer beautiful views. Hikers can find petroglyphs from three Native American cultures and stagecoach and wagon tracks in the grasslands from the Butterfield Stage Station.
 The park has 10 wilderness areas including the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument, established in 2009. The idea was to protect and conserve the area, which hosts a deposit of Paleozoic Era fossilized footprint megatrackways within about 5,280 acres. The area has footprints of amphibians, reptiles and insects, as well as plants and petrified wood that date back 280 million years. It is home to one of the most scientifically significant early Permian track sites in the world.
 Although there are plenty of hiking, horseback riding and off-roading opportunities on these areas there are no areas, yet, that are developed to see the fossils. They are being preserved for study. Some fossils have been removed and are shown in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque. For those interested in viewing the tracks, the Las Cruces Museum of Nature and Science has a 30 foot and a 15 foot trackway on display.
 Two other popular trails for a walk or hike are the La Cueva trail, offering a cave to explore, and the Fillmore trail, which has a mine and waterfall.
 Make sure to have water, good hiking boots or shoes, binoculars, snacks or a picnic. For information on the monument areas call the Bureau of Land Management at 575-522-1219 or visit blm.gov.
 Visit lascrucescvb.org for places to stay, eat and things to do. At this time check before you go to make sure that places are operating and the hours and restrictions that may be in place due to the coronavirus.

Twenty-five years of coaching taught Jerry Snodgrass a thing or two about human nature.
   
 "I think people tend to rise out of a crisis or various forms of adversity and come out stronger on the other end," said Snodgrass, the third-year executive director of the Ohio High School Athletic Association.
   
 "As a basketball coach, I always remember cases of losing to a terrible team one night and you're fit to be tied. The boo-birds are out. Then, the next night you come out and beat a state-ranked team you have no business beating. That's how tough teams are made."
   
 With the coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc on the global economy and shuttering sports at all levels, the OHSAA has its back against the wall.
   
 The nonprofit organization that oversees 816 member high schools and nearly as many junior highs and middle schools finds itself reeling financially following the cancellation of winter championships and the entire spring sports season.
   
 Given that a little more than 80% of the OHSAA's revenues come from ticket sales for tournament games, Snodgrass said the cancellations cost the OHSAA roughly $2 million. About $500,000 has since been recouped by returned facility rental fees, trophies, rebates and waiver of catastrophic insurance payments to the schools.
   
 As a nonprofit, the association received a $500,000 stimulus from the federal Paycheck Protection Program. A fundraiser with sponsoring partner Raising Cane's drew an additional $32,000.
   
 A big question, however, remains: Can the OHSAA survive a potential lost football season?
   
 "If fall sports don't happen, we'll probably have to reinvent ourselves," Snodgrass said in a recent interview. "We would have to make significant cuts and look at things very differently.
   
 "That said, I'm confident we will be back. But any strong business and board of directors has to be fiscally responsible and consider worst-case scenarios."
   
 Contact sports in Ohio, including football, basketball and lacrosse, can start practicing on Monday.
   
 Lt. Gov. Jon Husted made the announcement during the state's coronavirus news conference last Thursday. He called this phase 2.
   
 Contact sports will be able to resume full training schedules and scrimmages as long as they follow proper safety protocols. Those guidelines have not been released. It is up to local sports organizers and high school officials to decided when to proceed, according to Husted.
   
 Skills training for all sports in the state were permitted to resume on May 26. Those protocols for preventing the spread of COVID-19 included maintaining social distance; no additional spectators; avoiding physical contact like high fives and huddles; no congregating before or after practice; and coaches, players and guardians performing a symptom check before going to training.
   
 Snodgrass already volunteered to take a 25% cut in salary and his senior staff members 20%. One employee was laid off, and many others took significant benefit cuts.
   
 He added that state associations across the country, including the OHSAA, were dealing with budget cuts even before the pandemic hit in mid-March.
   
 The work-from-home order has prompted Snodgrass to consider cost-saving measures, such as conducting statewide meetings via video conference calls.
   
 Further methods of survival could include charging schools for membership and/or tournament entry fees.
   
 "I'm not keen about that, because I want to show all of our (school) people that we're committed to serving their needs first and foremost, but nothing is off the table in a dire situation," Snodgrass said. "We have to be creative and think outside the box, and our staff has been wonderful in that regard."
   
 The return of football -- and perhaps more important the return of fans to the stands -- is paramount.
   
 "The school athletic departments rely heavily on the revenue generated at games," he said. "And obviously the OHSAA needs that tournament revenue as well. We're also very concerned about the junior-high sports, how they would be impacted by having no fall sports."
   
 Snodgrass will not be the one making the ultimate decision about when, or if, high school sports can return in earnest. Gov. Mike DeWine's order shut down schools in March.
   
 "I'm a former coach, and we're all control freaks," Snodgrass said. "We want to make all the decisions. To me, it isn't a relief that we're at the mercy of the governor's orders. I want to call the shots, and at the very least have a say in matters regarding our student-athletes."
   
 Teams currently are participating in conditioning programs and workouts, employing cautious strategies that include no contact and requiring social distancing measures.
   
 "I know everyone is anxious to get back to normal," he said. "I think what we're doing currently is putting ourselves in a safe place to have sports start back up in August."
   
 In the upcoming weeks, Snodgrass will eagerly await news from DeWine and health officials.
   
 "The big unknowns right now that impact us hugely are when they will open up more in regard to what contact sports can do and what to do with mass gatherings," he said.
   
 Transportation for athletic teams is another issue pertaining to social distancing measures that will require guidance, Snodgrass said.
   
 "There are a lot of tough questions yet to be answered," he said. "It's hard to imagine high school football without a student cheering section or a marching band, but we're in unprecedented times."
