ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Two days after a federal judge ordered the U.S. Census Bureau to stop winding down 2020 census operations for the time being, the statistical agency said Tuesday in court papers that it's refraining from laying off some census takers and it's restoring some quality-control steps.

There is a dangerous contempt for science and fact that has become part of our political landscape, and Mr. Aresimowicz and Mr. Lungarini are giving cover to those who would bend the truth to fit the outcome they are seeking. The CIAC showed its hand weeks ago when it asked for advice from sports medicine doctors instead of infectious disease specialists.
 There are also those who, following the classic attack-the-media playbook, are suggesting that those covering this issue are somehow against football. Let’s pause a beat on that one — high school sports writers who cover high school sports for a living want seasons canceled? Newspapers such as The Courant, which devote energy and resource to covering high school sports year in and year out, are against football? Please.
 Those who suggest the metrics are low enough to play football miss the point. The goal is to keep the metrics low, and the way you do that — the way we’ve done it in Connecticut — is to avoid high-risk activities. That’s how we all stay safe. Gov. Lamont knows this and needs to stay the course.
 There is too much heat and not enough light in this conversation. The players who want to keep playing will rally again Wednesday at the state Capitol. Perhaps between now and then those who are supposed to be putting the health and safety of all the people of Connecticut over the thrill of Friday night lights will stop blaming and start leading.

Today, more than 100 engineers work around the clock to roll out updates at a relentless pace. SoftBank has brought in more Vision Fund companies as part of a burgeoning app ecosystem -- as the number of shops accepting PayPay soared, Mapbox, a U.S. mapping technology company, built a customized map so users can filter stores by category. Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing was made available directly through PayPay's app.
 SoftBank also bankrolled the venture lavishly, hiring thousands of salespeople across the country that were tasked with bringing shops onboard. The stream of updates from the engineering team caused chaos in the early days, a former employee recalled, "because features that we had described to a client yesterday would be totally different the next day."
 That was combined with eye-popping promotions for users, including a 10-billion-yen giveaway campaign shortly after PayPay's launch. Aggressive branding raised the app's profile; SoftBank, which owns a baseball team, even renamed its home stadium after PayPay.
 It kicked off its latest series of promotions with a "2000% bonus" campaign in August, in which one in five payments will give back between 2% to 20 times the transaction value.

The walkway between the mall and the parking garage was still being maintained by somebody. _Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater_ hinted at the problems facing the shopping mall in 1999, but the new game relishes in showing how that decline has accelerated in the decades since.

DAVIESS CO., Ky. (WFIE) - The Daviess County Board of Elections has its sights set on being ready for the November 3rd election. County officials are on the hunt for locations willing to host votersElection day will soon be here and with that comes a lot of behind the scenes leg work.“September 30 we have to have our plan turned in to the State Board of Elections," said Daviess County Clerk, Leslie McCarty.The County Clerk says polling locations aren’t so easy to come by this year.“Worst case scenario we don’t have as many polling locations as we would have hoped," said McCarty.Schools commonly used for polling places in previous elections are out of the question this year.“Of course schools are in session, they’re active and that creates more work for their staff to do another deep clean," said McCarty.That leaves other large venues throughout the county. But McCarty says some are apprehensive to lend their space.“Because of the coronavirus, there’s still that risk," McCarty.So far the clerk says they have three polling places secured - the Sports Center, Yellow Creek Baptist Church and Bellevue Baptist Church.“That has a separate entrance and exit and would be big enough for us to be six feet apart. So all the voting booths, all the check-in centers, machines where you scan the ballots," said McCarty.Bellevue Baptist Church officials say they’re happy to lend a hand on election day.“Everybody wants to be able to serve the community, and this gives us the opportunity to do that in a real tangible way in an election year," said Senior Pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church, Dr. Greg Faulls.Until their September 30 deadline, the clerk says they’ll be on the hunt for more polling places.“It’s just like the primary. It’s just a list of things that we have to account for. It’s caused quite a workload,” said McCarty.Election officials say you have until October 5 to register to vote. The deadline to request an absentee ballot is October 9. and early voting will begin October 13, wrapping up November 2 ahead of the election.Copyright 2020 WFIE. All rights reserved.

On the heels of the #BoycottMulan campaign reigniting on social media last week, Disney’s live-action “Mulan” has come under fire again.
 This time the film is courting controversy for crediting a number of Chinese government entities in Xinjiang, a region where authorities have been accused of human-rights abuses, such as operating “reeducation camps” that detain minority Muslim Uighurs.
 After the remake’s Disney+ debut on Friday, eagle-eyed viewers and human- rights activists took to social media to highlight the end credits, which thank the Turpan Municipal Bureau of Public Security and the Publicity Department of CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomy Region Committee, among others in the region.
 The public security bureau is reportedly tasked with running China’s so-called reeducation camps where Uighurs are held in detention. And the publicity departments are responsible for producing state propaganda that has worked to deny the detention program’s existence.

There is still a lengthy licensing process that home cooks must undergo in order to get the permit allowing them to open a home restaurant. There can only be one full-time employee and gross annual sales must not exceed $50,000. An organization called Foodnome can assist would-be cooks, walking them through the whole process, including food handling procedures, and adding them to an online list of vendors. It has seen a 150% increase in business since April (via Civil Eats). Although Foodnome's guidance is not required for licensing, it was founded by Akshay Prabhu, who has been lobbying for home- based cooking enterprises for years and is a guiding force behind AB-626. It's because of him that home cooks are now able to do this.

The voice is crucial, because the plot is minimal. Both this novel and “The Friend” are glimpses into the lives and minds of anyone who comes into contact with the narrator. It often feels like eavesdropping — quietly collecting stories firsthand and sometimes second- or thirdhand. (A man in her building courtyard tells a story about his mother, then about his friend and his friend’s mother.)
 The plot isn’t just secondary; it’s also unplanned. Nunez never outlines a story in advance. “I start with the beginning and move on and realize I’ve committed myself to certain things by putting things on paper,” she says. “I’m groping my way forward.”
 This is “nerve-wracking and requires a certain leap of faith,” she admits, especially when it comes to finding a proper resolution. She writes in small batches and revises them as she proceeds.

Enservco Corporation (ENSV) shares on Friday's trading session, dropped -2.65 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $0.12 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of -$0.28 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post -$0.12 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -25.80% and predicted to reach at 50.00% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was -24.10% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 20.00% for the next five year.

The one thing I tell visitors to do when visiting Cape Cod is Whale Watching. I previously lived in the Pacific Northwest and if you ask me East Coast whales know how to put on a show. Not only do you get to spend time on the water but you're reminded just how close you are to some of the biggest and most unique creatures still on earth. Whale Watching on Cape Cod bring you up close and personal and give you a really interesting insight into the history of Cape Cod. Aside from seeing them jump, dive, and spin, the naturists on board do a great job of educating everyone on board about not just whales but also fish, birds, and others inhabiting the waters around Cape Cod. I was lucky enough to be on board the first Whale Watch of the season with Hyannis Whale Watcher this year.  I also have two more trips planned with friends and family visiting before the season is over. If you're closer to the outer cape there are regular whale watches from Provincetown.
