Just as we fought and defeated President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security, we will mobilize and stop this attempt to diminish the vital guarantee of Social Security."

La iglesia salió al cruce este jueves de las versiones que consignaron en los últimos días que el presidente Alberto Fernández se aprestaría a enviar al Congreso el proyecto de legalización del aborto. La Conferencia Episcopal –que agrupa al centenar de obispos del país- consideró que sería “insostenible e inoportuno” su envío y tratamiento legislativo, particularmente en el marco de la pandemia de coronavirus. Desde el Gobierno, el secretario de Culto de la Nación, Guillermo Oliveri, considero tras conocerse el comunicado que “nadie se puede sorprender“ por el proyecto, ni se está ”escondiendo nada debajo del poncho” porque “el presidente lo anunció repetidamente y en persona a los obispos“, si bien aclaró ante una consulta de Clarín que desconoce cuando efectivamente lo enviará. La integrante del oficialismo que más avanzó en ese posibilidad fue la asesora presidencial Dora Barrancos, quien días pasados había vaticinado que el proyecto sería enviado “la semana que viene” –por la que está en curso- , al señalar que “estamos ante esa plausibilidad”. Otras voces, en off the record, también apostaron a que será inminente.En rigor, la primera institución religiosa en reaccionar fue el martes la Alianza Cristiana de Iglesias Evangélicas de la República Argentina (ACIERA) –que nuclea a la gran mayoría de los cultos evangélicos, que también consideró que “no es tiempo” de debatir la legalización del aborto en medio de la pandemia y que “la medida es irracional e inoportuna”. Tras señalar –entre otras situaciones- que “los heroicos agentes sanitarios agotados por el esfuerzo sobrehumano nos piden a gritos que cuidemos la vida; el sentido común -que abunda en el pueblo sencillo- nos revela que no hay lugar para pensar en proyectos legislativos que contradicen el discurso que dice cuidar a todos los argentinos como prioridad”. “Las últimas noticias sobre la inminente introducción del proyecto de Ley de aborto al Congreso Nacional nos sorprenden tristemente porque desalientan la búsqueda del encuentro fraterno e imprescindible entre los argentinos”, dicen los obispos en el comunicado que lleva la firma del presidente del Episcopado, monseñor Oscar Ojea. Los obispos le recuerdan al Gobierno que “la Iglesia ha acompañado todas las acciones destinadas a enfrentar y mitigar las consecuencias del Covid-19. Lo hemos hecho –subrayan- con prudencia y respeto a las decisiones de la autoridad política y sanitaria ya que sabemos que la búsqueda y el fortalecimiento de la unidad es una consigna para la superación de todo lo que nos aflige como país y como humanidad”. “Nos preocupa todo cuanto pueda alejarnos de este compromiso por la unidad a favor del bien común o que pueda acrecentar la brecha que nos divide”, señalan y agregan que “la pandemia nos ha alertado que el Estado debe velar por el cuidado de la 'salud pública, es decir, el cuidado de la vida humana”. En ese sentido, afirman que “no cuidar todas las vidas, toda la Vida, sería una falta gravísima de un Estado que quiere proteger a sus habitantes. Invitamos a la prudencia política –añaden- para no desalentar la búsqueda de la máxima unidad posible en un cuerpo social herido por los desencuentros entre argentinos“. “Así como la dignidad de la vida y la promoción de los derechos humanos son conceptos centrales en una agenda auténticamente democrática, la situación general de la Salud Pública, planteada por esta dolorosa coyuntura, hace insostenible e inoportuno cualquier intento de presentar y discutir una ley de estas características”, concluyen. A su vez, los evangélicos destacan que “la pandemia no ha pasado. Estamos en cifras cercanas al millón de casos de Covid-19. Los sistemas sanitarios están colapsados en diferentes lugares del país, y con récord de muertes diarias, escalando a los primeros lugares del mundo”.“Sin importar esta situación, las presiones de los grupos pro aborto y la decisión del Gobierno de impulsar la Ley, a pesar de que hace dos años el mismo Congreso de la Nación la rechazó por amplia mayoría, hace que nuevamente estemos frente a una discusión que solamente produce grietas en el país”, afirman.DD

KINGWOOD — The Preston County Health Department is urging everyone to wear masks and follow other safety guidelines in light of a recent upswing in COVID-19 cases.
 The health department on Monday announced seven new cases in the county. On Wednesday, three additional cases of the virus were confirmed, bringing the total to 162 confirmed cases with 24 probable ones.
 “Two of the cases are prison-related. We are pretty confident two are travel- related. Two are related to prior positive cases, and one we are not so sure. So the assumption is community transmission,” Health Department Administrator V.J. Davis said Monday.

An Associated Press count from earlier this week showed Democrats outvoting Republicans by a 2-1 ratio in the 42 states included in the count. Republicans have been bracing themselves for this early Democratic advantage for months, as they've watched President Donald Trump rail against mail-in ballots and raise unfounded worries about fraud. Polling, and now early voting, suggest the rhetoric has turned his party's rank and file away from a method of voting that, traditionally, they dominated in the weeks before Election Day.
