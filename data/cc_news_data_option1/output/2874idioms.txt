Biden promised to pay for his latest plan by reducing tax breaks for real estate investors with annual incomes of more than $400,000, while increasing compliance with existing tax law for high earners. As he spoke, the Trump reelection campaign released a statement accusing Biden of embracing an “unaffordable left-wing agenda” that would force him to raise taxes on the middle class. Biden has vowed not to do that but has endorsed rolling back the GOP-led tax cuts that are the Trump administration's signature policy accomplishment.

Last week, my partners and I made the tough decision to close the Dart Bowl, an Austin institution founded by my grandfather 62 years ago. Our decision was "just business," brought on by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, after bowling the final frame and eating the final enchilada late Friday night, it was tough to say goodbye to that place on Grover Avenue that has witnessed so many meaningful events.
   
 Since the day in 1958 when the Dart Bowl's doors opened at its original location at Burnet Road and Anderson Lane, the focus has been on providing simple family entertainment. The timeless nature of the game makes it a level playing field for everyone, from little kids to nervous teenagers on their first date. Over the years, we saw our share of celebrities, thanks to being chosen as a location for movies such as Richard Linklater's "Boyhood," and shows such as "Friday Night Lights." Even with competition from movies, video games and the Internet, bowling held its own because of its inherently social nature. Then the coronavirus came along.
   
 We followed government orders and closed our doors from March 17 to May 18, confident we'd be able to bounce back. Before we reopened, we followed CDC guidelines by adding Plexiglas shields, providing social distancing with alternating lanes and even investing in new disinfecting equipment. When the shelter-at-home order was lifted, we threw open the doors and waited to welcome longtime customers ready to cure their cabin fever, but they stayed away. We can't blame them -- this virus is not a game -- but every day they stayed away, the worse it got on our balance sheet.
   
 Since we announced our plans to close Dart Bowl forever, we've been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support. The phone calls, text messages, emails and social media comments have come at us in a rush, letting us know that people share our sadness at the end of this era, even as they cherish their memories of time spent with us. We've been reminded of countless birthday bashes, holiday parties and friendships made over coffee or enchiladas. No matter how long ago it happened, people still remember the highest score they ever recorded or the first time their kid rolled a strike on our lanes.
   
 I can remember my own boyhood games, rolled with my grandfather on Sunday mornings, and working here in the summers during college, along with King Ray, the son of my grandfather's partners, Jerry and Betty Ray. He and I both always assumed that we'd pass along our interest in the Dart Bowl to our own kids, so it was especially difficult to decide to close. It was also tough because it put more than a dozen people out of work, including several employees who have been with us for decades. Peggy Zamarippa, the woman who makes the secret recipe chili in Dart Bowl enchiladas, has been working in the Cafe for nearly 50 years.
   
 I would never compare our loss to that of people whose loved ones have suffered or died from the coronavirus, but the outbreak has proven deadly to small businesses as well. We hope our other two facilities will be better positioned to survive the pandemic, but only time will tell.
   
 We encourage our fellow Austinites to take stock of the locally-owned businesses they love and make a point of supporting them. Otherwise, they may not survive this economic slowdown, leaving our town a little less unique as a result. Let's work together to make sure our town is just as weird next year as it was 62 years ago.
   
 From the bottom of our hearts, thank you all. Stay safe.
   
 Donovan, an Austin native, is co-owner of the Dart Bowl, Highland Lanes and Westgate Lanes along with his wife, Jacy, and the Ray family.

Beginning in August, the group and its sister nonprofit will begin pumping millions of dollars into online ads targeting a group of roughly 1.7 million “low-information” left-leaning voters — largely women of color under 35 — spread across Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia who don't know much about Biden and probably wouldn't turn out to vote without a push. The strategy represents a significant shift away from a broader group of “persuadable” voters in swing states who have been the overwhelming focus of more traditional political groups.
 Recent polls suggest that much of Biden's support comes from a coalition of voters united far more by their disdain for Trump than their affinity for Biden. There is also agreement between the campaigns that many voters don't know Biden or his plans very well, despite his lifetime in Washington.
 Biden's team has largely dismissed the issue, pointing to the intensity with which many voters oppose Trump. But sensing opportunity, Trump's campaign has been flooding swing states with anti-Biden attack ads trying to can scare away would-be Biden supporters or at least persuade them not to vote at all.
 Democratic strategist David Plouffe, who served as campaign manager for President Barack Obama, said it was difficult even for Obama to persuade some lower-information voters of color to show up for the nation's first Black president. It will be harder for Biden, Plouffe suggested, even though Biden served as Obama's vice president for eight years.
 “A lot of the swing voters that are now in Biden's column, they aren’t voting for him because they think he’s going to be on Mount Rushmore,” said Plouffe, who sits on PACRONYM's board. "They’re voting for him because they’re sick and tired of Trump and they think Biden is a fine alternative.”
 “These voters are hard to reach, hard to turn out," Plouffe added. "And with (Obama), there was a little more excitement.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to states' rights, President Donald Trump is all over the map.
 To battle the coronavirus, he has told states they are largely on their own. But when it comes to stamping out protests in cities led by Democrats, Trump is sending in federal troops and agents — even when local leaders are begging him to butt out.
 It is a driven-by-expedience approach that has been a hallmark of his stormy presidency, one that has little to do with ideology and more to do with Trump’s reelection efforts.

The timing couldn’t be better for a Black Lives Matter testament about racially-biased policing. A minor traffic infringement in Cleveland turns tragic in a struggle between a white cop and a black driver. The latter is a churchgoer, played by _Get Out_ ’s Daniel Kaluuya, and who has been on an awkward Tinder date with a young attorney (Jodie Turner-Smith). What they lack in chemistry soon becomes necessary joint resourcefulness as they flee, branded as dangerous fugitives and cop killers. They head south to Florida, while media coverage brands them as a Bonnie and Clyde. Of course, they aren’t bank-robbing criminals, but they do attract support and sympathy as victims of the law enforcement system.
