After finding fame as the mauled zoo keeper in the hit Netflix documentary "Tiger King," Kelci "Saff" Saffery has also found himself in another spotlight - a row over gender pronouns.
 Saffery appears in the series as the victim of a tiger attack at Joe Exotic's zoo in Oklahoma who opts for amputation rather than two years of reconstructive surgery after the accident, and is back at work days after leaving hospital.
 Throughout the series the good-natured keeper is referred to as "she" despite identifying as male since childhood.
 Saffery, 34, said he didn't mind being called "she" in the series but the anger this misuse of pronouns had provoked online towards had been an eye- opener for him.
 "I don't think they intended to be cruel in any way, but dismissive or not, it still made a very, very loud statement about the way they feel about the (LGBT+) community," Saffery told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
 "Personally it doesn't bother me ... (but) these titles and these pronouns, they matter just as much as calling someone by the wrong name. It's something that you shouldn't dismiss."
 Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.
 Netflix recently collaborated with LGBT+ advocacy group GLAAD on the #FirstTimeISawMe campaign to raise transgender visibility in the media. GLAAD found 38 transgender characters on television in 2019 which was up from 26 a year earlier.
 But the misgendering of Saffery was a sore point for many.
 "They practically erased Saff as a trans man," said a blog by LGBT+ business network MyGWork, while news site LGBTQ Nation said Saffery was shown "as a lesbian without any context."
 Saffery said, however, he did not identify as transgender as he had not had any gender reassignment surgery or taken cross-sex hormones, but he lived as a man and used the pronoun he.
 "My children call me dad, they do not call me mom," said Saffery, who has three children, aged from nearly one to 11, with his longterm female partner.
 "I can't remember a time when I knew (anything) different ... I just think it was obvious, what I wanted, the way I wanted to live and my family immediately supported that," he added in a phone interview from his new California home.
 MURDER, MYSTERY AND MAYHEM
 About 64 million households watched "Tiger King" in the four weeks after its March 20 premiere, according to a projection in an April 21 Netflix letter to shareholders, making it the smash viewing hit of the global coronavirus lockdown.
 The documentary sparked a list of controversies as it followed the life of the now-imprisoned Joseph Maldonado-Passage, aka Joe Exotic, a gay, polygamous exotic animal owner, along with past and present employees.
 The seven-part series - which was even raised at a press conference with U.S. President Donald Trump - also focused on Joe Exotic's feuds with other big cat zoo owners in the United States, including his arch rival Carole Baskin.
 But it was the keeper at the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park who won many viewers' sympathy, when his arm was mauled after he put it into a tiger's cage and for his good nature.
 Saffery blamed himself for the accident in 2013 and was back at work a week later with his arm amputated below the elbow, a decision he insists was his and not due to pressure from Exotic.
 "I had done that same routine with that same tiger 100 times before and I broke protocol. I broke routine, I got complacent, and my mistake led to that tiger being a tiger," he said.
 Saffery said he had wanted to work with tigers since he was a child but still had no "clear answer" on whether tigers and other big cats should be kept in captivity.
 He joined Exotic's zoo in 2010 after finding it via a Google search when he left the U.S. army, having served for six years as a female soldier in missile defense system and bomb disposal units, including twice overseas in Iraq and then Afghanistan.
 However Saffery left the zoo industry in 2018 after becoming disillusioned with those in charge, and was working in a warehouse before the series aired and the coronavirus pandemic.
 "Guys that I looked up to in this industry ... you see them destroying each other," he said.
 While in lockdown, Saffery has been relishing spending more time with his children and making money from his new-found fame by sending video messages to 250 plus paying fans online.
 "I'm thoroughly enjoying every second of it," Saffery said. "It's a nice second chance and I won't take it for granted."

MIAMI — The NBA has pushed back the possible reopening date of some team practice facilities for at least a week until May 8 at the earliest, saying Monday the extra time was needed in part to make sure player training options would be safe and controlled in an effort to try to mitigate the threats caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
 And when those facilities reopen, the rules will be strict.
 The May 8 date is far from firm, the NBA said, warning teams that it “may push this timing back if developments warrant.” The league planned on giving teams the option of reopening facilities as early as Friday, though ultimately decided more time was needed across the league for many reasons.
 But whenever those practice courts open — local government clearance would be needed first in all cases — there will not be an immediate return to normal. A person with knowledge of the league’s plans said players would have to wear face masks inside facilities except when working out, that any staff members present would have to wear face masks and gloves, and that a minimum distance of 12 feet would be required as a buffer between players and staff members working with them.
 The exception in that 12-foot case would be when medical or athletic training personnel are in contact with players. The person spoke to the the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the details were not publicly released.
 There are numerous other details of the league’s facility-reopening protocols, the person said, including:
 — Players who return to their home-team markets from out of town will have to quarantine before being allowed back in the facility.
 — All equipment used by players in their voluntary workouts, including basketballs, will have to be disinfected before being used again. Players will not be allowed to share towels, and teams will not be permitted to make steam rooms, saunas, cold tubs, oxygen chambers or cryotherapy chambers at the facilities available.
 — Teams will have to designate a staff member as a “Facility Hygiene Officer” to oversee all new policies. Players will have to enter the facility alone, without family members, friends or personal security.
 — All cell phones, keys and other often-touched items must be cleaned and disinfected upon entry to the facility.
 “Our foremost priority remains everyone’s health and well-being and we will continue to follow the NBA’s guidelines, while also continuing to listen to public health experts and observe local governmental directives,” Orlando Magic spokesman Joel Glass said.
 When teams can reopen, other rules will include a limit of four players at a facility at any one time, no practices or scrimmages will be allowed, and no head coaches or assistant coaches can be part of the voluntary workouts.
 NBA players are also still prohibited from working out at public health clubs, fitness centers, or gyms.
 The NBA suspended the season March 11 after Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz was the first player to test positive for COVID-19. It ordered teams to shutter their facilities eight days later, saying at the time it was doing so “in light of the rapidly-developing coronavirus situation, and consistent with evolving advice from health experts regarding how to promote individual and public health while minimizing the spread of the virus.”
 Facilities have not been opened since, and this step — when it happens — does not mean a return to NBA play is imminent. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said repeatedly that he does not believe the league will be in position to make any decision on whether the season can resume until sometime in May, at the earliest.
 “There’s too much unknown to set a timeline, even too much unknown to say, ‘Here are the precise variables,’ ” Silver said on April 17.
 The push toward reopening facilities started after certain states and municipalities began loosening restrictions on personal movement. Georgia and Oklahoma are among the states that have already allowed some businesses to reopen and Florida’s two most populous counties, Miami-Dade and Broward, announced plans Monday to loosen some of their stay-at-home policies starting later this week.
 Johns Hopkins University, which tracks the amount of cases and deaths based on figures revealed by governments around the world, showed Monday that the U.S. count was nearing 1 million confirmed cases. More than 55,000 people in the U.S. have died because of the virus.

Kept under lock and key at Incite’s former reconditioning facility in remote Sonora, Mexico, Solomon has run through so many simulations of the end of the world that it has lost its digital marbles. Solomon recognizes Caleb, though not by his given name-rather, Solomon recognizes Caleb by his serial number, as Caleb has spent time in this facility before. In a series of flashbacks, Caleb recalls his time in gruesome reconditioning therapy, where sick psychiatrists altered his memories against his will. We learn that, although Caleb left the facility after recalibration, shunted into the role of hunting down and eliminating other “outliers” that posed a threat to Incite’s predictive narratives, 90% of outliers subjected to this process fail to graduate. Instead, their bodies remain on ice and in stasis in the Sonora facility. Sounds a lot like the cold storage vault beneath Westworld, doesn’t it?
