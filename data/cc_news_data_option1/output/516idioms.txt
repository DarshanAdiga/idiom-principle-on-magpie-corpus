The onus now moves onto MSPs. The Budget must be passed in the next four weeks, which requires opposition MSPs to work with the Government make a deal. Crucially, business will not want any nasty surprises in the manner of last year’s workplace parking levy. Whatever the merits of the policy, having that measure dropped in without any impact assessment or costings provides a level of uncertainty which makes businesses very nervous. We hope the final Budget won’t have any similarly unpleasant surprises.
 Retailers were hoping for certainty, competitiveness, and competitiveness in this year’s Scottish Budget. We were looking for Government to take action to reduce and keep down the burden on our members and their customers at a time of economic volatility. By and large the Government has presented such a Budget. We hope MSPs will move forwards with alacrity to secure a settlement which supports businesses and delivers economic growth.

 Speaking to BBC WM, Dowling continued: "We agreed a deal with Crystal Palace and he went down to London for a medical.
 "They came across an issue in his knee which we'll hopefully get to the bottom of and know the exact problem he's got. Hopefully, if not before the end of the season, then pre-season he'll be back up and running.
 "The discussions we've had with his representatives since deadline day suggest that he will still leave us at the end of the season."
 After joining the club at the age of eight, Ferguson progressed through the youth ranks to the first team and has made 20 appearances since making his full senior debut in August.
 The English defender was part of the West Brom squad that reached the semi- finals of the FA Youth Cup last year and has not played since their 2-1 defeat by Cardiff in January.
 "We look at ourselves and we know the size of the contract we offered and the opportunity we've given him on the pitch so we've done everything we can," Dowling added.
 "[Him staying here] has not even really been spoken about, so if we can get a deal agreed with someone between now and the end of the season that we're happy with then we will do that.
 "But if not, whoever does take him, it will go to a tribunal."

The majority of people at Thursday’s hearing did not want to see Senate Bill 1530 pass. In fact, many didn’t feel this decision should be up to the Senate at all but should be up to the people.
 “This is not a decision the legislature should decide,” said concerned citizen Vicki Shower. “There’s lots of controversy over this. It should be Oregon citizens’ choice. I am asking you to put it to a general vote.”
 At times Thursday, testimony got heated and emotional as people discussed how Senate Bill 1530 would affect them and their businesses.
 “If this passes, he loses everything. And it’s not just him, there’s going to be farmers losing everything as well,” said Annette Walker from Brownsville.
 Donnis Smith said, “I’m asking you, please, allow the people of this state, who put many of you in the positions you’re in… you work for us… allow these people behind me to have a voice.”
 This all followed a massive protest outside the Capitol starting early Thursday morning.
 “My husband is a logger and so the cap and trade or the big tax would affect his business. It would cost him a lot of money,” said Barbara Hettwer from Scotts Mills.
 Thousands rode down to the Capitol and held a rally to show their disapproval.
 Protesters argued that this bill is just about raising taxes to help the government.
 “I don’t think it is about carbon emissions. It is not about the environment. It is a money grab. We have seen it in California, we have seen it in other places and we are not going to stand for it,” said Michelle Adame from Salem.
 During testimony, committees like timber union said there are plenty of ways to cut carbon tax without raising taxes.
 One member of that union said she took over her husband’s company after he died and this bill will force her to close her doors.
 “I am just totally disturbed that you would put me out of business because of this fuel increase and then call me leakage and then put me into a transitional workforce program,” said truck driver Angelita Sanchez.

The pair remains on the defensive so far this week and is now navigating the area of 4-month lows following the recent breach of the 1.1100 mark. As usual, dynamics around the buck are expected to remain the exclusive driver of the pair's price action for the time being along with alternating risk appetite trends in response to developments from the Wuhan coronavirus and the US-China trade scenario. On another front, the ECB is expected to finish its strategic review (announced last Thursday) by year-end, leaving speculations of any change of the monetary policy before that time pretty flat. Further out, some better-than-expected results in the euro region as of late seem to have lent support to the idea that the bloc could have left the worst behind, although that view looks premature, to say the least.

Jonathan Caldwell is 110th in the Race to Dubai standings
 After starting Friday sharing 14th position, Caldwell is now tied for seventh after a strong afternoon in Australia.
 Caldwell sunk three birdies in the first seven holes, and although a bogey on the eighth halted his momentum, a he picked up a further shot on the tenth before sinking an eagle on the 17th.
 Clandeboye man Caldwell, back on the European Tour for the first time in a decade after coming through the Tour School in November, is 110th in the Race to Dubai standings by dint of his share of 14th place at the Alfred Dunhill Championship.
 The top 110 at season's end will be guaranteed tour cards for 2021.

Un grande limite della lotta ai virus, fino ad oggi, era la maggiore o minore tossicita di tutte le sostanze realmente virucide, da quelle piu drastiche come la candeggina a quelle di uso medico - ma soltanto esterno - come la tintura di iodio.  Infatti i farmaci antivirali che si usano comunemente non sono dei veri virucidi, nel senso che non distruggono i virus, ma si limitano a contenerne la crescita. E questo e un problema perche il virus puo rimanere dormiente, pronto a tornare aggressivo quando l'organismo risulta indebolito, oppure puo mutare e diventare resistente ai farmaci che l'hanno domato.

For her glam look, she wore minimal makeup, filled in bushy brows and a blush pink lip hue. She pulled back her hair in a low undone bun.

For us, Sonam failed to strike a healthy balance between the golden brocade and colours.

It was also good to see ordinary workers protected from income tax rises, and indeed to see Scottish income tax rates remain frozen. Retailers are dependent on consumer spending, and consequently any moves to restrict the disposable income of the average Scottish worker would have been problematic. That said, inflation-busting council tax rises seem to be in the pipeline. Further measures to help the transition to a zero-carbon economy are welcome, as are continued investments in infrastructure.

During 2019, households protected by the default price cap are estimated to have saved £1bn on their energy bills.
 Ofgem closely monitors suppliers complying with the cap and has taken action when they have not met their obligations.
 This summer, Ofgem will carry out a review for the government on whether the market conditions exist for the default price cap to be lifted or be extended past 2020.
 Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: "The default price cap is designed to protect consumers who do not switch from overpaying for their energy, whilst encouraging competition in the retail market.
 "Suppliers have been required to become more efficient and pass on savings to consumers. In its first year, the cap is estimated to have saved consumers £1 billion on average on their energy bills and switching rates have hit record levels.
 "The announcement is further good news for the 15 million households covered by both price caps who will see their energy bills fall in April. Households can reduce their energy bills further by shopping around for a better deal."
 The price caps are a limit on the cost of a unit of gas and electricity.
 They are not a cap on customers' overall energy bills, which still rise or fall in line with their energy use.

Is there a new No. 1 goalie in Grand Forks? I'm not trying to stir anything up, just asking a simple question.
 Backup goalie turned starter Peter Thome was about 11 minutes away from racking up back-to-back shutouts last weekend versus Colorado College, and Thome's numbers since Adam Scheel was pulled on Jan 10 vs. Omaha are eye- opening. He has a 4-0-1 record, a stingy 1.35 goals-against average, and an equally stingy .928 save percentage.
 A few questions come to mind.
 Is the job Thome's now as long as he plays well? Will a couple of bad goals subject him to a quick hook? Is there any way coach Brad Berry does not start Thome vs. Denver next Friday? Are we possibly looking at a two-goalie rotation the rest of the way? Perhaps most importantly, what is Berry's commitment level to either goalie at this point?

Batman breaks the rules
 All of this changed with Christopher Nolan’s _Batman_ trilogy, which started with 2005’s _Batman Begins_. Heath Ledger’s unforgettable performance as the Joker (in the 2008 _The Dark Knight_ ) might be the most immediately identifiable aspect of the trilogy today, but it was _Batman Begins_ that became the more influential film in the long run.
 The thing that distinguished it from its peers was the attention to detail: whether it was the art direction, the dialogue, or the little hat-tips to vintage Batman story arcs (evoking the work of legendary comic artists like David Mazzucchelli and Frank Miller). If _Iron Man_ opened the commercial floodgates and ushered in the Marvel era of box office dominance, _Batman Begins_ showed Hollywood that well-made comic book movies could be competitive in the awards season. Cinematographer Wally Pfister was eventually nominated for an Oscar as well. Although he didn’t win, the point was well-made (and later consolidated, of course, with Ledger’s posthumous Oscar).
