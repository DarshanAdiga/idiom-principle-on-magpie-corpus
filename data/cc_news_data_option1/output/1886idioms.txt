Ever wondered what sea turtles do out in the water? Biologist Nathan Robinson and his team at the Cape Eleuthera Institute did, so they attached small underwater cameras to green sea turtles to record their powerful yet graceful movements off the coast of Eleuthera, a Bahamian island.

Disney obviously has more to worry about than its four cruise ships these days. All but one of its theme parks worldwide remain closed. Multiplex operators are also closed, drying up what is historically the first release window for its industry-leading movie studio business. The production of new TV shows and movies is also on ice, and most Disney Store locations remain shuttered. Both stocks have taken on water in 2020, making back some of the losses in recent weeks after hitting multi-year lows in March. The businesses are ultimately very different, so let's take a deep dive to see which stock is the better buy.

Of course, as Jamison‚Äôs pandemic essay means to tell us, we were never truly isolated to begin with; it‚Äôs one reason ‚ÄúAs I Lay Dying‚Äù has 15 narrators, a kaleidoscope of voices sprawling across the nine days of toil and trouble it takes to get Addie‚Äôs body in the ground. Diski understood that too, tracking the progression of her illness not because she imagined it might save her but because she knew it would not. It‚Äôs this clarity I want as a reader. It‚Äôs this I aspire to when I write. What I‚Äôm referring to is resilience. What I‚Äôm referring to is perseverance, which has been our most defining aspect all along.

Para el parlamentario de Unidas Podemos, citar a los gallegos a las urnas en menos de dos meses es "una tremenda imprudencia temeraria" y "una burla al enorme sacrificio" para contener la expansi√≥n del virus, cuya evoluci√≥n "es incierta", por que, seg√∫n G√≥mez-Reino, los movimientos de N√∫√±ez Feij√≥o buscan "ama√±ar el proceso electoral".
 "Las vidas y el futuro de los gallegos est√°n por encima de los intereses del PP. Este pa√≠s no es un campo de juego para las ambiciones del PP", ha aseverado antes de subrayar que su candidatura quiere "elecciones cuanto antes para acabar con los a√±os de recortes de Feij√≥o" pero cree que "no hay garant√≠as" para que los gallegos voten "con seguridad" y "sin miedo" en el horizonte que plantea la Presidencia de la Xunta.
 INFORMES "CONTRADICTORIOS" Y "AMBIGUOS"
 Adem√°s, ha asegurado que los informes esgrimidos por Feij√≥o para recomenzar el proceso pr√≥ximamente son "contradictorios", "ambiguos" y "reconocen la impredicibilidad del comportamiento del virus", adem√°s de "omitir que no est√° demostrada la incidencia estacional" del bacilo.
 En definitiva, y tras afear que los informes fuesen remitidos a los medios antes de compartirlos con los grupos de la oposici√≥n (G√≥mez-Reino dice haberlos recibido a √∫ltima hora del mi√©rcoles), considera que estos documentos "creados 'ad hoc'" para "sostener" la postura de la Xunta de celebrar, dice, las elecciones cuanto antes "en absoluto avalan" que los comicios puedan celebrarse "con seguridad" y sin "poner en riesgo la salud de los gallegos" en las primeras semanas de julio.
 Asimismo, ha asegurado que Galicia En Com√∫n trabaja con sus propios "expertos" en el campo sanitario y que cuentan con "datos clar√≠simos" de que las previsiones de la evoluci√≥n de la pandemia no despejan el calendario para el comienzo del verano.

Much of the time, we can get away with holding such a notion at a distance. Now, however, we are face to face with it. ‚ÄúHow often,‚Äù Faulkner writes, ‚Äúhave I lain beneath rain on a strange roof, thinking of home.‚Äù It‚Äôs an open-ended question, but in its specificity ‚Äî rain on a strange roof? ‚Äî it offers something sustaining: a sense of what it means to live each moment on its own terms, and a reminder that in a time that feels unmapped and raw, we have been here before.

While not an environmental essay per se, Thoreau‚Äôs Civil Disobedience makes the case for nonviolent resistance as ‚Äúa counter friction to stop the machine.‚Äù While democracy might be the best form of government we can hope for, the dominance of the majority inevitably leads to the trampling on the hopes, dreams and rights of the minority. In Thoreau‚Äôs mind, individuals shouldn‚Äôt let governments doing the will of an amoral or immoral majority overrule their own consciences and thus enlist them as collaborators in injustice.

Even when it comes to cruising, Disney will have an easier time filling its much smaller fleet when the coast is clear. It caters to a younger audience than traditional cruising, which is a group that's less at risk than the typically older passengers on the larger cruise lines who may not be allowed to sail for the time being. It's a premium brand with a niche audience, and it should recover long before 45% of the global cruise audience returns to Carnival with open passports. Disney is the better buy here.

El portavoz adjunto de Cs en el Congreso, Edmundo Bal, ha dicho este jueves al PSOE que "se olvide" de vivir permanentemente en el estado de alarma y le ha instado a formalizar un "plan B" porque esto "no es un cheque en blanco".
 En rueda de prensa en el Congreso, previa a una reuni√≥n de la comisi√≥n para la reconstrucci√≥n social y econ√≥mica, Bal ha dicho que si el Gobierno est√°, de verdad, estudiando el "plan B" es porque est√° cumpliendo con los acuerdos de Cs y ha subrayado que el voto a favor fue con condiciones no porque apoyen al Ejecutivo de Pedro S√°nchez.
