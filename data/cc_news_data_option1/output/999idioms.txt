He can pass, and when Trayden (Williams) was out for a little while, he played point guard for us," Lewis said. "He does a lot of things well and the main thing is people love him for his scoring. That's probably going to be his major impact on the game on Saturday will be his ability to shoot the basketball."

He'll throw in an "xXx: Return of Xander Cage" or a "The Last Witch Hunter" to remind us all he's more than Groot or Dom Toretto. He can also be a generic action star with a gravelly voice and a contract that requires him to be in a tank top for at least 70% of the movie. And so arrives the obligatory "Bloodshot," an adaptation of the Valiant Comics character of the same name, directed by video game auteur David S.F.

Interior demolition work inside of the former bank building will be getting underway this month, according to Jim Spencer, the city’s economic and community development director.
 “This includes knocking out walls to have a more open floor plan,” Spencer said of the interior work. “The goal is to be operational by September.”
 Alorica, which manages personnel for Intuit, already has about 80 employees working at the temporary site, which is the old AAA Travel building. Employees are trained to handle calls related to Intuit’s online products, QuickBooks and Mint. The company also owns TurboTax and other online services.
 Intuit has been looking at the former Summit Bank building for its headquarters since making the announcement that it was creating a prosperity hub in downtown Bluefield in March 2019.
 There has been a lot of planning going on behind the scenes since that time, including a review of the building by design engineers to make sure the proposed floor plan meets Intuit’s needs.
 Intuit and Alorica plan to eventually have up to 500 employees working in downtown Bluefield, and the move to the new location will afford the two companies additional space for more employees.
 Spencer said the customer success center will be expanded in the new headquarters. Alorica also is continuing to train additional employees, who will need to be ready once the prosperity hub is opened at the new permanent downtown site.
 John Miller, Alorica’s manager of the customer success center on Commerce Street, said in an earlier interview that employees work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., normally in different shifts to concentrate on having the most people there during the busiest time of the day, usually in the afternoon.
 About 40 people were providing “chat work” assistance at the time with Intuit’s Mint, a free, web-based personal financial management service for the United States and Canada. More have been trained since then to handle voice calls related to QuickBooks.
 We are excited to hear that renovations to the former bank building are getting underway.
 These are certainly exciting times for Bluefield. Intuit has already provided a huge boost to the city, and once the full prosperity hub is operational, we can expect to see even more foot and vehicular traffic in the downtown area.
 This is something everyone should be excited about.
 A lot of planning and work behind the scenes has occurred to make it happen, including bringing in design engineers to make sure the floor plan of the headquarters meets the company’s needs.
 Intuit/Alorica plans to eventually have up to 500 employees working in downtown Bluefield.
 The customer success center will be expanded in the new headquarters as the current temporary location has about reached capacity, but Spencer said training there will continue as more employees will be needed to come on board and be ready when the prosperity hub opens.
 Details of the innovation lab have not yet been released, but it will include working with entrepreneurs on starting new businesses as well owners of existing businesses who may want to expand.

Eateries and small traders here are feeling the pinch as the famous beating retreat ceremony at the Attari-Wagah border has been suspended due to the coronavirus scare, stemming the flow of tourists to the area. It has also hit the hotel and tourism industry in the holy city.Each day, nearly 50,000 tourists used to visit the border, mainly to catch a glimpse of the beating retreat ceremony, which has been suspended till further orders. Taxi operator Raman Sharma said before the ceremony was suspended, he used to get hundreds of bookings every day.He used to provide vehicles -- ranging from small cars to sedans and multi-purpose and sports utility vehicles -- to tourists to travel to the international border. My business has been hit hard after the retreat ceremony was suspended recently, Sharma said on Thursday.He said he had to pay salary to 20 drivers who worked for him, but things had become difficult for him now. Amritsar Deputy Commissioner Shivdullar Singh Dhillon said, The retreat ceremony was stopped due to the increasing fear of coronavirus and the decision to suspend the event was taken keeping public health in view. The ban on public entry will continue till further orders. Sarhad, a popular hotel-cum-restaurant on the nearly-25-km Amritsar-Attari road leading to the border, wears a deserted look these days.Owner Aman Jaspal said the footfall at his restaurant had dropped sharply after the retreat ceremony was suspended. In the current circumstances, the government should exempt the hotel industry from service tax since running expenditure like staff salary, electricity bill and other things cannot be avoided. The government should at least take small steps to save the hotels near the Indo- Pak border, he said.We are not the only sufferers. Many people like rehriwallas, dozens of kiosks, small traders have shut down their evening business for the time being and it will be tough for them to get two square meals if the current situation continues for a few more days, Jaspal added. Amandeep Singh, an autorickshaw driver, said, More than one hundred autorickshaws used to ply on the Attari road. Most of the drivers have purchased new autorickshaws by taking loans, but with no tourists to ferry now, paying bank installments and earning livelihood have become difficult. Surinder Singh, president, Amritsar Federation of Hotel and Guest Houses, said there was a 50-per cent fall in bookings due to the coronavirus scare.A 50-per cent cancellation in online hotel bookings has been reported. When tourists come to know that they cannot visit the border to watch the retreat ceremony, they cancel their booking, he said. Amritsar is also a preferred destination for many filmmakers, but the coronavirus scare has not even spared this sector, Ajaydeep Singh Salothra, owner of Bioscope Production House, said..

Spring has sprung, the days are getting longer, the weather is getting warmer and the flowers are opening. As a child, I remember early spring as being a riot of color and the air being filled with the sound of birds singing louder as they returned after a cold winter. The air also had a different scent and feel; I guess more humidity returning to the air. Anyway, one knew spring was on its way. It was fun to anticipate when the first signs of brown bushes would explode into color.      As spring approaches, so do some of my favorite flowering shrubs. These early spring flowering plants brighten up the landscape (as well as my mood). I am crazy about some of the new shrubs that flower in March and April, but I cannot forget about the ones that I recall from my childhood. Those that created the nostalgic memories that I cherish.      I was one of five girls and we all walked to school, as did all of our friends. As you walked, you tended to notice more. We passed by houses that had some of the same shrubs in their garden that we had in ours. People in those days did not have very sophisticated bushes; the houses with prettier yards were because of the placement of plants rather than having unusual plant material.      As I think back on what blooming shrubs we had to look forward to, the vibrant yellow flowers of two shrubs come to mind first. Forsythia was in many gardens and a few people had another one named Kerria japonica, or Japanese rose as some called it, which bloomed shortly after the forsythia finished flowering. Both have long arching branches and make a magnificent display of color. Forsythia flowered first and was like a ray of sunshine after the dark days of winter. The brightly colored flowers that covered the branches opened to a profusion of blooms. Then, not too long after the forsythia turned green with the new foliage, kerria would take center stage. With those long arching branches of brilliant yellow blooms, who could help but enjoy them. Both of these are extremely hardy and so easy to grow that I am sure that is why most homes grew them.      Another old-fashioned shrub is quince. I love quince not only because of my childhood memories but for other reasons too. Most of the ones that I saw growing up had red flowers and many people had this plant somewhere in their yard. The old-fashioned varieties had fruit that resembled apples. They were quite bitter and, as children, we would dare someone to take a bite of the fruit. People would make jam from the bitter, apple looking fruit that would be present in the summer. Today, the quince I grow does not have the large fruit that I remember. I guess that has been bred out of the newer varieties.      Today, I grow three different quince bushes and they are some of my favorite plants, but it is for a different reason. It might not be the prettiest bush when it is not flowering, but I love it because it is easy to force into bloom. I pick branches starting in early December and bring them in the house to open up. I do this about every two weeks after that so that I have a continuous arrangement of them blooming in the house. When I pick the first branches, it takes them longer to open, but after Christmas, it takes less and less time for them to open when I bring them into the house since they are getting closer to the time when they would naturally open.      People think I am so talented for having these flowers in the house, but all it takes is to remember to pick them and bring them in to open up. Try it next winter and you, too, will be rewarded with an abundance of flowers. The branches I do not pick look pretty over a long time in the garden. You can find quince in white, pink, red and an orange-red.      Now, if fragrance is a trait you really want to have in your garden, you cannot beat the fragrance of Daphne and Korean spice viburnum. Daphne is a low growing evergreen shrub with a wonderful fragrance that when brought in the house, will perfume a room.      Korean spice viburnum is a flowering bush that is so aromatic that it fills the air with a lovely scent when in bloom. The buds are pinkish in color and then give way to white flowers. My daughter, Laura, gave me the bush that I presently have and I think of her each time it is in flower. This somewhat larger shrub produces clusters of dainty, pastel-pink buds in late March and the spicy fragrance alone is worth growing this delightful shrub.      I do not know what plants stir up memories of your childhood, maybe you remember some of these jewels. I hope you enjoy spring and the waking up of the trees and shrubs and enjoy those lovely sounds that fill the air. I certainly do.

That’s why investors were especially tough Monday on the stocks of companies, such as Halliburton and Schlumberger, that supply equipment to U.S. oil fields.
 It’s funny, but it wasn’t that long ago when lower gas prices would have been celebrated from coast to coast. That was before the shale oil explosion helped the United States end its dependence on foreign oil.
 One unfortunate byproduct, however, is that the U.S. economy no longer thrives on lower oil prices. True independence from foreign oil cartels will come not from fracking, but from a far greater investment in renewable energy supplies.
 Economists, too, worry that the domestic oil industry’s slowdown could be a harbinger of another downturn in U.S. manufacturing.
 The sector hit a rough patch in the first six months of 2019, but consumer spending was strong enough then to keep the U.S. economy growing. Thanks to the coronavirus, however, a number of headwinds are building.
 The tourism industry is tanking.
 Events are being canceled right and left, pulling countless dollars out of the host communities and, in the case of business conferences, wiping out the deal-making that many companies rely on. A wide range of industries with China-linked supply chains are running out of products and parts.
 Restaurants, theaters, concert promoters and other businesses that rely on consumers venturing out in public are starting to feel the pinch.
 The plunge in the markets can only make matters worse.
 The “wealth effect” of the rising stock market helped spur consumers to borrow and spend more, with household debt hitting a record $14 trillion earlier this year. The market’s plunge could promote the opposite reaction, further crimping consumer spending.
 As last Friday’s jobs report shows, the U.S. economy was chugging along at a decent clip through February. And there are signs that China may have COVID-19 under control, potentially allowing that country’s manufacturers to get back on track and easing the strain on supply chains and global demand.
 So if health officials succeed in halting the spread of the coronavirus here, then the episode may pass with a relatively small number of casualties, human or corporate. Still, it would help if federal and state governments started looking at the virus as more than just a health issue, and got ready to respond accordingly.
 President Donald Trump said Monday he would be taking several proposals to Congress aimed at boosting consumer spending and helping workers who don’t have paid sick, and that’s a good place to start the conversation.

The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to accord urgent hearing on a petition seeking postponement of the Indian Premier League-2020 amid the coronavirus scare. A vacation bench of justices U U Lalit and Aniruddha Bose told the petitioner that he could mention the matter for urgent listing before the regular bench on March 16, when the apex court will re-open after the Holi break.
 "This is not a matter which cannot await till re-opening of the court. You can mention it before the regular court on March 16," the bench told advocate Mohan Babu Agarwal, who has filed the petition. Agarwal told the bench that the Indian Premier League (IPL)-2020 is scheduled to start from March 29 and would continue for almost two months, but no safety measures have been declared to prevent the spread of coronavirus during the matches, which are likely to witness over 40,000 spectators in each match. "We are sitting in a vacation bench. We will hear those matters which cannot wait. All IPL matches will not start on March 29. You can mention it on March 16," the bench said.
 The number of coronavirus patients in India has risen to 73 with 13 fresh cases, the Union health ministry said on Thursday. Agarwal told the apex court that during the IPL, players, commentators and broadcasters from foreign countries which are hit by coronavirus would come to India and there is a possibility of spread of the virus during large gatherings in such matches. "This IPL is just a domestic professional tournament with no contribution to ICC records and is a private tournament and the risk in the times of Covid-19 (coronavirus) is quite high due to huge crowd gathering including players, staff, cheerleaders etc," the plea said.
 "They (BCCI and other concerned authorities) should explain how they are going to deal with the recent threat of Covid-19 and is it not the right time to either postpone or defer the same to future date as the threat is apparent in all probabilities looking into the present scenario," it said, while referring to number of coronavirus cases in several countries and deaths caused due to it. The plea has arrayed the Centre, ministries of health and law, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), IPL administration and IPL teams as parties in the matter.
 It has sought a direction to the Centre to take "effective, strong and war footing steps" to curb the outbreak of coronavirus. The plea has also sought a direction to "either stop, postpone or defer for future dates all such huge programs like IPL etc, avoiding large public gathering for the time being till it (coronavirus) is being controlled". While seeking a direction to scrap IPL matches, the plea has sought "appropriate action" against BCCI, IPL administration and teams participating in the tournament for allegedly "violating the law and undermining the government directives on large public gatherings looking to the recent threat of Covid-19 outbreak in the interest of justice".
 It said the eight teams, which will participate in IPL, will have up to 200 players, including 50-60 foreign cricketers, and 120 support staff who would be directly involved in the matches and there is also a threat as "autograph seekers come in direct contact and close proximity with players". The plea claimed that Japan, which will host 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, has said that the games could be held later in the year and might not start on July 24 as planned due to coronavirus. It said that worldwide, several sporting events have been postponed amid the spread of coronavirus. PTI ABA MNL SJK SRY.

For example, the striking air inlets of the front apron optimise the fresh air flow of the radiator. Together with the specially developed front design, this also results in improved downforce for more road grip overall. At the sides, striking side skirts and the grown wheel arches show the well-known MANSORY signature. And here too, visual enjoyment and technical functionality go hand in hand. E.g. the new carbon components not only look impressively good, they also act as air fins and supply large amounts of fresh air to both the unit under the new full carbon engine hood and the rear brake system. The newly developed double diffuser is responsible for perfect airflow underneath the vehicle and the large rear spoiler in conjunction with the rear skirt is responsible for downforce on the rear axle. The vehicle width of the "MANSORY Cabrera" is also increased by 4 cm in the course of the body conversion.

 “That’s not in this play,” Schor was quick to add. “This is very PG-13.”
 “It’s totally family-friendly,” Sewell said. A live drum, piano and trumpet trio will provide music that with such iconic tunes as “Let Me Entertain You” and “Everything’s Coming Up Roses,” “everyone will recognize at least half of the songs, from various cartoons and car commercials out there.”

She clarified that the city will be issuing four separate building permits — three for each of the 66-room hotel’s buildings and one for its parking lot.
 According to the staff notes for the city council meeting, “Currently, the project is in the process of obtaining building and grading permits from the city’s building and engineering departments,” the report states, noting that “Building permits generally take several rounds for a project this complex, with multiple buildings.”
 Svanstrom said the plans for the hotel had been handed over to a third-party reviewer for final look before the building permits will be granted, something that surprised and frustrated the developer.
 “We are eager to start,” Piazza Hospitality owner Paolo Petrone said, “Without the building permits, we can’t close on our construction loan.”

Global equities and oil prices fell through the floor again on Thursday after Donald Trump banned all travel from mainland Europe to the US for a month to fight the coronavirus, ramping up fears the global economy will careen into recession. The news came after the World Health Organization officially labelled the outbreak a pandemic and hit out at "alarming levels of inaction" for its spread.
 Asian equity markets, already deep in the red in reaction to the WHO announcement, cratered after Trump's address. Tokyo ended down 4.4 per cent, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20 per cent from a recent high, while Sydney lost 7.4 per cent in the ASX 200's worst day since the 2008 financial crisis.
 Hong Kong fell 3.7 per cent, though Shanghai was off 1.5 per cent as China continues to see infection rates slow. Seoul, Singapore and Jakarta lost more than three per cent, Mumbai tanked more than six per cent and Wellington slid five per cent, while Taipei retreated 4.3 per cent.
 Manila crashed 10 per cent -- sparking a brief trading halt -- after it emerged Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte would undergo a precautionary test for the virus, while his finance minister and head of the central bank were among several officials who were to go into quarantine. It ended down 9.7 per cent. Bangkok also triggered an automatic halt by falling 10 per cent.
 In early trade London and Paris each plunged 4.5 per cent, while Frankfurt dived five per cent. Gulf markets also tumbled, with Riyadh down more than 4.0 per cent. The Japanese yen, a key haven in times of crisis, jumped more than one per cent against the dollar.
 "Travel restrictions equal slower global economic activity, so if you need any more coaxing to sell... after a massively negative signal from trading in US markets it just fell in your lap," said AxiCorp's Stephen Innes. The losses followed another brutal session on Wall Street, where the Dow fell into a bear market and futures pointed Thursday to another rout.
 The coronavirus outbreak has left virtually no sector untouched, though travel and tourism have been particularly hard-hit as countries institute travel bans and quarantine requirements, with Italy in a country-wide lockdown. The number of cases across the globe has risen to more than 126,000 with 4,600 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
 In announcing the Europe ban -- which excludes Britain \-- Trump said the continent had seen a surge in new cases because governments failed to stop travel from China, where the COVID-19 epidemic began. He said the prohibitions would also "apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo," and "various other things as we get approval".
 However, the White House afterwards clarified that "the people transporting goods will not be admitted into the country, but the goods will be". Oil prices were also hammered, with both main contracts falling around six per cent at one point before edging back slightly. The oil market was already under pressure after Saudi Arabia and Gulf partner UAE stepped up a price war with plans to flood global markets.
 "We are now staring at the whole world going into a lockdown," Vandana Hari, of Vanda Insights, said. "Oil demand can be expected to crash through the floor and all previous projections on oil consumption are now out the door." The Saudi move was the latest escalation of a fight among oil producers after Russia balked at an OPEC-backed plan to cut production in response to lost demand because of the coronavirus. "Markets are crying out for a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 headwinds and a lack of concrete US policy action is rattling markets," said Tapas Strickland, senior analyst at National Australia Bank.
 Trump's address included several measures intended to ease the financial burden particularly for small business, including payroll tax relief and deferred tax payments. But he did not unveil any large-scale tax cuts, which OANDA's Jefrey Halley said "has probably disappointed markets more than anything".
 The bloodbath across global trading floors has come despite a raft of measures by governments worth at least $150 billion to offset the impact of the outbreak, while central banks will be called upon to cut already low interest rates and introduce other fiscal measures. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will do "whatever is necessary" to help the economy, while the European Central Bank is to hold a policy meeting later in the day at which it is under pressure to open up the taps..

Avi Kaplan is finally ready to hit the road again more than two years after leaving Pentatonix.
 In May 2017, Kaplan announced his departure from the multiple Grammy Award- winning a cappella group — known for its arrangements of Christmas songs and pop hits by Daft Punk, Kanye West, Britney Spears and more — after six years as its founding bass singer.
 A month later, he released his first solo EP, the folk-leaning “Sage and Stone,” under the name Avriel & the Sequoias.
 But a tour wasn’t forthcoming until last year, when Kaplan finally played some dates in July and August on his Otherside Tour. He kicked off this year with a European tour, and will play Volcanic Theatre Pub on Saturday with a three- piece band featuring guitarist/bassist Kaleb Thomas Jones and drummer/keyboardist Noah Denny in support of “I’ll Get By,” his second EP and first released under his own name.
 “I had been in (Pentatonix) for a long time, and I was just running on empty for a long time, so I needed to just come back from that and reconnect with my roots,” Kaplan said from a tour stop in Austin, Texas. “I did a lot of traveling; I did a lot of hiking, camping, backpacking. And I just went full throttle into that: just a lot of healing and reconnecting with myself and with loved ones and all of that. So I spent time doing that, and then after that I spent a lot of time writing because I knew that I still wanted to do music. ... One of the reasons I left the group was because I was getting burnt out and I was starting to see music as a job, and I would never, ever want that. It means too much to me.”
 Fans are already well aware of Kaplan’s passion for music, as evidenced by his heartfelt performances with Pentatonix and his equally heartfelt video announcing his departure from the band and posted to the group’s Facebook page. “I’ll Get By” addresses the departure and the emotional journey Kaplan has been on since leaving, with songs such as “Change on the Rise,” the title track and the classical-leaning “Chains” delivering Kaplan’s soul-searching via multipart harmonies.
 “I definitely use music as therapy for myself; it’s very, very therapeutic,” Kaplan said. “... And some of the songs are a bit of a story, but most of them are definitely — I think the only one that is more of a story is ‘Full Moon’; everything else is very much true to how I was feeling or how I was feeling when I was in the group.”
 Sonically, the EP pushes Kaplan further into the modern indie-folk world, stripping away the string arrangements found on “Sage and Stone” in favor of a more vocal-oriented approach.

Eateries and small traders here are feeling the pinch as the famous beating retreat ceremony at the Attari-Wagah border has been suspended due to the coronavirus scare, stemming the flow of tourists to the area. It has also hit the hotel and tourism industry in the holy city.
 Each day, nearly 50,000 tourists used to visit the border, mainly to catch a glimpse of the beating retreat ceremony, which has been suspended till further orders. Taxi operator Raman Sharma said before the ceremony was suspended, he used to get hundreds of bookings every day.
 He used to provide vehicles -- ranging from small cars to sedans and multi- purpose and sports utility vehicles -- to tourists to travel to the international border. "My business has been hit hard after the retreat ceremony was suspended recently," Sharma said on Thursday.
 He said he had to pay salary to 20 drivers who worked for him, but things had become difficult for him now. Amritsar Deputy Commissioner Shivdullar Singh Dhillon said, "The retreat ceremony was stopped due to the increasing fear of coronavirus and the decision to suspend the event was taken keeping public health in view. The ban on public entry will continue till further orders." "Sarhad", a popular hotel-cum-restaurant on the nearly-25-km Amritsar-Attari road leading to the border, wears a deserted look these days.
 Owner Aman Jaspal said the footfall at his restaurant had dropped sharply after the retreat ceremony was suspended. "In the current circumstances, the government should exempt the hotel industry from service tax since running expenditure like staff salary, electricity bill and other things cannot be avoided. The government should at least take small steps to save the hotels near the Indo-Pak border," he said.
 "We are not the only sufferers. Many people like rehriwallas, dozens of kiosks, small traders have shut down their evening business for the time being and it will be tough for them to get two square meals if the current situation continues for a few more days," Jaspal added. Amandeep Singh, an autorickshaw driver, said, "More than one hundred autorickshaws used to ply on the Attari road. Most of the drivers have purchased new autorickshaws by taking loans, but with no tourists to ferry now, paying bank installments and earning livelihood have become difficult." Surinder Singh, president, Amritsar Federation of Hotel and Guest Houses, said there was a 50-per cent fall in bookings due to the coronavirus scare.
 "A 50-per cent cancellation in online hotel bookings has been reported. When tourists come to know that they cannot visit the border to watch the retreat ceremony, they cancel their booking," he said. Amritsar is also a preferred destination for many filmmakers, but the coronavirus scare has not even spared this sector, Ajaydeep Singh Salothra, owner of Bioscope Production House, said..

This is not a complete list, but a sampling that shows how YouTube TV now has major holes in its regional sports coverage throughout the United States. In addition to the examples above, YouTube TV is not carrying the YES Network in New York or Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket in the Los Angeles area. Unlike Hulu, YouTube TV also doesn’t have a deal to carry Marquee Sports Network, which will show Chicago Cubs games this year.
 ## An unusual deal
 Let’s back up a little bit and make a distinction: YouTube TV has not dropped the national FS1 and FS2 sports channels, which are owned by Fox Corporation. Fox regional sports networks (or RSNs), despite their name, were acquired by Sinclair last year, when Disney divested the networks as part of its 21st Century Fox acquisition.
 Anyway, since Sinclair took over those regional sports networks, it’s lost several distribution deals. Dish Network dropped Fox RSNs from both its satellite service and Sling TV streaming service over the summer and doesn’t seem eager to get them back. FuboTV, which once prided itself on its sports programming, quietly dropped Fox RSNs in early January, and PlayStation Vue shut down later that month.
 While I’m not privy to what was happening behind the scenes with YouTube, I imagine Sinclair was under a lot of pressure to reach an agreement. The traditional TV business is now in steep decline, and while streaming services like YouTube TV aren’t growing quickly enough to compensate, they’re at least slowing the rate of decay. With more than two million subscribers, YouTube TV is one of the only pay TV bundles whose subscriber numbers are increasing every quarter.
 YouTube was likely facing pressure as well, both from subscribers threatening to quit if it dropped regional sports and from a desire not to lose a pricing edge over Hulu + Live TV, which has 1.2 million more subscribers despite being $5-per-month more expensive. Thus, the companies have landed on a deal in which YouTube TV is excluding some regional Fox Sports networks and only allowing a subset of customers to access the others.
 We can only guess at how this works out financially. It could allow YouTube to use its newfound cost savings in sports-free markets to absorb price hikes for sports in others. Or as one Redditor theorized last week, it could allow YouTube to avoid minimum subscriber requirements in areas where sports teams are less popular. In any case, carving up regional sports coverage this way is highly unusual.
 “In my entire history of covering this space, I’ve never seen this happen,” Rich Greenfield, a media industry analyst at LightShed Partners, said in an interview this week.
 That’s probably because it doesn’t make a lot of sense, especially for a service that’s available nationwide. From a marketing perspective, any claims YouTube now makes about its local sports coverage should now come with a big asterisk, and anyone who wants to recommend YouTube TV to their friends (or, ahem, readers) will need to think twice about where those people live.
 It’s a messy situation for YouTube TV, but an even messier one for Sinclair, which might now need to entertain even more patchwork deals as it negotiates future contracts with other TV providers. A big one, Greenfield points out, is Comcast, whose agreement with Sinclair comes up for renewal in September.
 “If I was looking at my contract, I’d be saying, ‘Why can’t I do this, too?’” Greenfield said.
 As with so much else in cord-cutting, I’d like to think this breakdown is the start of a bigger disruption, in which fans can access live sports without being tied to a big bundle of TV channels at all. But the path from here to there is going to be fraught with more customers getting a raw deal.

Another approach is to pick a fanciful name--one that has been invented for the sole purpose of functioning as a trademark, such as Pepsi, Kodak and Exxon. What a company does today may not necessarily be what it does tomorrow, so choosing an arbitrary or fanciful name allows for future flexibility. Since Amazon has no significance in connection with books, Amazon.com was able to expand into selling music, electronics and most every other kind of product under the sun, using the same company name. Similarly, the name Google has unlimited flexibility as a brand because it isn't descriptive or suggestive of an internet search engine.

Shas leader Aryeh Deri called upon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White leader Benny Gantz on Thursday to overcome their differences and form a "national emergency government" under Netanyahu, due to the coronavirus.
 Deri will make that recommendation to President Reuven Rivlin on Sunday when representatives of the eight parties in the new Knesset meet with Rivlin.
 "There is no other way of dealing with this challenge other than a large emergency government with a wide national consensus, and we must do that, because there unfortunately is no other government," Deri told Army Radio. "It is either going to another election, which would be crazy in our situation."
 Netanyahu frequently seeks the political advice of Deri, who is one of the most experienced politicians in Israel. Deri was the first politician Netanyahu met with after the March 2 election.
 Deri criticized Blue and White leader Benny Gantz for continuing to seek a minority government, for seeking to unseat Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein and for Blue and White's bill that would make it illegal for an indicted MK to form a government and serve as prime minister.
 This is not the time to play games, he said.

Imagine you are zipping by on a highway, right at the edge of the speed limit, while humming to a tune playing over the radio. Out of the blue, you see a truck hurtling towards you. You have mere seconds to react, and everything depends on what you do next. If you get it wrong, you may not have another chance — unless, of course, this scenario is unfolding in virtual reality (VR) or in a high-tech simulator that mimics a real car. Simulation allows students to keep replaying emergency situations, until optimal reactions get ingrained and their split-second decision-making skills are fine-tuned.

BRUNSWICK COUNTY, N.C. (WECT) - They say it takes a village to raise a child. Volunteers at Samara’s Village work to teach young parent how to raise a healthy child.Only four years old, the organization opened to address the alarming teen pregnancy rate in Brunswick County, compared to the counties that surround it.“We want to change lives we want to help people and we don’t want to see the cycle continue," said Debbie Keener, Program Director. "We don’t want to see them have another unplanned baby; we don’t want to see their baby’s become teen parents before they’re ready to become parents. If we can make a difference and make them understand how to prevent an unplanned pregnancy then we’re making an impact.”Keener is head of the program that brings in new and soon to be parents and teaches them about parenthood. They go to class and even get a mentor to guide them on what to expect.These “Home Visitors” are parents and grandparents who have their own families and use their experiences to help these new moms and dads.“Just an ear to listen," said Alexia Campbell, a student at North Brunswick High School. "I’m so grateful to have someone to listen to me talk and support me through everything.”Alexia is a student at North Brunswick High school and Kevin Arago goes to Cape Fear community college. When their daughter Harmony born, it wasn’t easy. They weren’t sure how they were going to be able to continue on the same path.Alexia’s dad heard about Samara’s Village and their mindsets completely changed.“Made us feel like it’s a blessing instead of something that’s going to hold us back," Kevin said. "They’re just telling us you can still be whatever you want in life, you just have to work a little harder, but this is a blessing at the end of the day.”Alexia is still on her school’s soccer team, rejoining the team after only eight weeks after childbirth. She wants to be an architect while Kevin is looking is making strides towards becoming a nurse.Neither of their dreams are far from becoming a reality with the help of Samara’s Village. It’s a place where they learn how to be responsible for the life they’ve created while striving to improve their lives still to come.“We can’t go back and change history, so it’s like here’s where we are, let’s meet them where they are, let’s move them forward to where they want to go," Keener explained.Samara’s Village has helped more than 50 teens and young adults with their pregnancies, each with their own unique story.The one-of-a-kind organization hopes to expand to surrounding areas in the future to act as an outlet for teen parents who need assistance.Copyright 2020 WECT.

Harvey Weinstein is back in Bellevue Hospital just hours after he was sentenced to serve 23 years behind bars.
 The disgraced movie producer suffered chest pains following his day in court in Manhattan on Wednesday and was hospitalised for "ongoing heart problems", according to his spokesman.
 "It's a complication related to his back surgery," Juda Engelmayer told the New York Post. "We are incredibly appreciative of the level of care and attention the NYC Dept. of Corrections is showing regarding Mr. Weinstein's medical condition."
 Weinstein is expected to be held overnight.
 The 67-year-old underwent an angioplasty procedure on 4 March before being admitted to Rikers Island prison.
 Meanwhile, Weinstein's legal woes are far from over - prosecutors in Los Angeles are seeking to have the convicted rapist extradited from New York to face separate charges of sexual assault.
 Shortly after the shamed film mogul was sentenced to more than two decades in prison for sex crimes in the Big Apple, representatives from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced they had started the process to have Weinstein transferred to California, where he was slapped with four felony counts in January.
 An arraignment date has yet to be set, but the producer, who turns 68 next week, faces another potential sentence of up to 28 years behind bars if convicted at trial, according to editors at TheWrap.com.
 The charges of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force, and sexual battery by restraint relate to accusations made by two women, who claim Weinstein attacked them in individual hotel encounters in 2013.
 He has denied all allegations, maintaining any sexual acts were consensual.
 Weinstein's attorneys are appealing his New York conviction.

After importing medical supplies to Lebanon for 20 years, Hassan Hamdan shut his business in December. Sales were plummeting, clients couldn't pay, and the dollars he needed to buy imports had dried up. Now he drives an Uber.
 Businesses such as Hamdan's have been shutting at a rapid rate since a financial crisis exacerbated by months of political instability has brought much of Lebanon's economy to a halt. "Everyone is in debt - even me - because of what's happening. But I'm able to afford food for the house and a few bills. Without Uber, I would be begging," said Hamdan, 37.
 While Lebanon produces little hard, up-to-date economic data, interviews with two dozen business owners, union leaders, industry groups and traders paint a picture of an economic and financial crisis without precedent since independence in 1943. More than 220,000 jobs in the private sector have been shed since mid-October when protests fuelled by worsening economic conditions erupted against the political elite, according to a survey in February.
 "It's a social catastrophe," said Ramzi El Hafez, general manager of InfoPro, the research firm behind the survey. "This is the heaviest one-shot drop since the end of the civil war ... There is no end in sight. It is an open-ended crisis." A fifth of workers in the hotel industry, a traditional engine of the economy, have been laid off and in the southern city of Sidon, one in five shops has already shut down.
 The job losses since October are a major blow to Lebanon's employed workforce, which the International Labour Organisation estimated at just 1.59 million in a 2019 report. Importers of critical goods such as medical supplies say their requests for dollars have gone almost entirely unmet since February, leaving many hospitals dangerously low on everything from heart stents to dialysis equipment.
 "Almost all the work has come to a halt. We're unable to do anything," said Mohamad Sukkar, who owns a contracting company. His business is frozen, stuck between banks that will not cash cheques and suppliers demanding payment in dollars he cannot get. "We've had to close down all the work and we're not taking up any new work," said Sukkar.
 Hard hit businesses were dealt yet another blow this week as Lebanon ordered malls, restaurants and other venues to close to stop the spread of the coronavirus, as well as halting flights from the worst hit countries. 'AFRAID TO BRING IN GOODS'
 Lebanese banks have attracted huge foreign inflows for years by offering some of the region's highest interest rates, allowing the country to pay for imports despite low exports. But inflows have fallen sharply in recent years along with economic growth, dragged down by regional turmoil, a nine-year war in Syria and strained relations with wealthy Gulf states.
 Lebanese expats who had been propping up the economy with remittances, meanwhile, started to hold back funds as banks began imposing strict controls which now limit withdrawals for regular customers to as little as $100 a week. The situation has deteriorated since the political crisis to the point where Lebanon said this month it can't repay its sovereign debt as well as pay for essential imports.
 Virtually locked out of the banking system, importers have struggled to keep up with the rising price of dollars. The Lebanese pound has lost about 40% of its value since October, hiking the price of everyday imported goods. As dollars grow increasingly scarce, the country's import-dependent supply chain has slowed to a crawl.
 Traders of foodstuffs say they have slashed imports by 30%-40%. Industrialists say they're struggling to source raw materials. Consumers and businesses gripe about rising prices and slumping sales. "We're getting to the stage where we're afraid to bring in goods," said Mohammed Yakoub, who supplies restaurants. His sales have slumped 70% since October as the economic crisis takes its toll on businesses.
 At least 785 restaurants, cafes and nightclubs went belly-up from September through February, with 240 shut in January alone, according to the sector's main union. "There will be more unemployment, there will be a big exodus, people will look for work abroad, we are already seeing this. We will lose yet another batch of good workers that we would have liked to retain in the country," said union general secretary Maya Bekhazi.
 RUNNING OUT OF WHEAT Among the tell-tale signs that dollar flows are getting even more critical is what traders describe as a near halt in a central bank process launched in September to secure foreign currency for critical goods - medicine, fuel, and wheat.
 "The central bank has stopped transfers for all operations related to importing wheat for about a month. It is completely shut down, so now we are in the process of running out of stocks," said Crown Mills flour mill owner Paul Mansour. Mansour said mills unable to pay foreign suppliers were considering asking the government to import grain: "The stocks have decreased and within 40 days will be depleted."
 Many cities outside Beirut appear harder hit. South of the capital in Sidon, its once bustling market is lined with empty storefronts up for rent. "Even the shops you still see open are unable to sell anything," said shopkeeper Abdullah Merzoub. "Things are getting harder".
 The head of the Sidon trade association, Ali al-Shareef, said 120 of the city's 600 shops have closed since October and he expected the number to double in the next few months. "We're headed toward a bigger and bigger collapse," he said.
 Emptied of guests, hotels have laid off 20% of their workforce and put the rest on half-time, said Pierre Achkar, head of Lebanon's hotel federation. "This is the lowest occupancy rate I've seen in 50 years," he said. "If the summer is bad, I think we will have a lot of hotels that will close."
 Many companies, such as Chip, which provides security systems, said they were staying in business despite heavy losses only because shutting down and reopening would be more costly. Chip chief executive Hady Nahas said he was keeping his 72 employees on even though turnover was only 15% of what it was a year ago - but he would be forced to do something dramatic by the end of the year if things don't improve.
 "We're draining our personal resources as owners. There's a limit, and I don't know if the situation will be resolved ... before we break," said Nahas.

Even with all this doom and gloom within the inner workings of newspapers, there are still many bright spots to celebrate during National Sunshine Week. Thousands of local communities still have newspapers dedicated to providing factual and essential news to citizens about their local government, taxes, laws and public controversies, disasters and celebrations. Sonoma County is home to nine newspapers that are adjudicated by the California Superior Court as newspapers of “general interest” and that serve the public good. These newspapers are where government agencies and courts are required to publish public notices, court decrees, election dates, etc. These Superior Court adjudications in no way control what, or what not, any one of these newspapers shall print in their news pages, opinion columns or affiliated websites.
 Still, it is too bad that Madison and the other framers of our U.S. Constitution did not include a perpetual business plan or ownership solution for the financial needs of a free press. Think of it, what kind of libraries or schools might we have today, if they had to be run as private businesses and without taxpayer support? Isn’t a newspaper just as much of an indispensible institution as a library, school, museum or hospital?
 What we are finding out in these days of digital disruption and civic disorder is that the century-long business model where newspapers sold commercial advertising to perform their democracy-saving work has been a fraud. What does advertising to sell soap, beer or cars have to do with Jefferson’s or Madison’s vision of a free press and independent journalism? Democracy and ethical journalism should never be dependent solely on how many ads get sold or don’t get sold.
 The source of true sustainability for a free press, ultimately does not lie with the journalists; it relies on its readers.
 “An informed citizenry is the bulwark of a democracy,” said Jefferson.
 It’s not sunshine that keeps our government honest, it’s what citizens and journalists together make with that sunshine that preserves our democracy.

They acted quickly to save her life by maneuvering the Sugar Island Ferry for emergency pickup procedures by a makeshift good samaritan crew assembled by Roy. Their swift actions stabilized the survivor's condition and swiftly transported them to awaiting emergency responders on the mainland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "We are incredibly proud of the heroic and quick response by Captain Rosenbum and Mr. Roy," commended Captain Patrick Nelson, Commander Sector of the Sault, who presented the Coast Guard Certificate of Merit to the two crewmen on March 4. "It is a clear testament to their proficiency and dedication as professional mariners and their strong sense of civic responsibility to their community."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The good samaritans who assisted with the rescue, Sonny Menard, Fred Newton, and Bob LaPointe, were also recognized by Captain Nelson, "These good samaritans embody the UP spirit of community selflessness. We thank them for stepping up to assist with saving a life."

Somehow, the growth of tire changing machines market is related to the growth of the automobile sector. With stable automobile sales and higher infrastructure spend, the production of the tire is set to gain. Manufacturers in the tire changing machine market are expected to continue their growth momentum and register a revenue growth led by a strong performance in the commercial vehicle segment. Additionally, headway in demand for tire changing machines will be driven by the expanding middle class in developing countries; due to the fact that these regions are likely to experience increased vehicle ownership. Subsequently, replacement of tires and acceleration in the wheel servicing activities to reinforce the pace of tire changing machines market.

BLUEFIELD — By September, Intuit/Alorica should be able to move into a permanent headquarters on Federal Street in Bluefield and increase the number of employees in the process.
 Jim Spencer, the city’s economic and community development director, said Summit Community Bank is moving its employees from its 500 Federal Street branch to its newly renovated full service facility at 525 Federal Street.
 Summit Bank said in an announcement its branch officially closed Friday.
 Intuit plans to make the 500 Federal Street location, which is owned by the city and managed by the Bluefield Economic Development Authority (EDA), a “prosperity hub” that will include a customer success center and an innovation lab.
 Alorica, which manages personnel for Intuit, already has about 80 employees at Intuit’s temporary offices on Commerce Street. Employees are trained to handle calls related to Intuit’s online products, QuickBooks and Mint. The company also owns TurboTax and other online services.
 Spencer said the interior demolition at the 500 Federal Street location will begin March 9.
 “This includes knocking out walls to have a more open floor plan,” he said. “The goal is to be operational by September.”
 Intuit has been looking at the building for its headquarters since making the announcement it was creating a prosperity hub in downtown Bluefield in March 2019.
 A lot of planning and work behind the scenes has occurred to make it happen, including bringing in design engineers to make sure the floor plan of the headquarters meets the company’s needs.
 Intuit/Alorica plans to eventually have up to 500 employees working in downtown Bluefield.
 The customer success center will be expanded in the new headquarters as the current temporary location has about reached capacity, but Spencer said training there will continue as more employees will be needed to come on board and be ready when the prosperity hub opens.
 Details of the innovation lab have not yet been released, but it will include working with entrepreneurs on starting new businesses as well owners of existing businesses who may want to expand.
 John Miller, Alorica’s manager of the customer success center on Commerce Street, said in an earlier interview employees are there from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., working in shifts to concentrate on having the most people there during the busiest time of the day, usually in the afternoon.
 About 40 people were providing “chat work” assistance with Intuit’s Mint, a free, web-based personal financial management service for the United States and Canada.
 More have been trained since to handle voice calls related to QuickBooks.
 Miller said he has seen a “steady” applicant flow and he calls the ones that have been hired “overachievers.”
 “They have been great and really push themselves,” he said. “They really want to do well” and are “surpassing what we were looking for.”
 Spencer said the city has also been working to help make sure people are available with the right skills.
 “We want to make sure there is a good talent pool ready for them to choose from,” he said of workforce development efforts.
 Spencer said it is unclear if Intuit will continue to use the Commerce Street location after the move to Federal Street.
 “But is a win-win either way,” he said.

Chinese city of Hubei, close to the epicenter of the novel coronavirus had lifted production limits and restriction on the movement of people for the first time after the outbreak but had to implement a complete lockdown just 30 minutes after it opened, reported South China Morning Post. At 830 am on Wednesday Local time, the government said that all restrictions on the movement of people and traffic would be lifted at 10 am.The government again clamped down the movement at 1030 am local time. The city will continue its restrictions on the movement of traffic and residents, the government said, without explaining further. Later in the day, the Hubei government issued a statement outlining the different restrictions that applied to each city within the province based on their particular situation of the Covid-19.It also said that only a handful of businesses in key sectors were permitted to resume their operations. The statement also imposed a harsh lockdown in the city of Qianjiang, despite having the lowest number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 of any city in Hubei.The provincial authority has classed it as high risk and ruled that all public transport would remain suspended. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the epicenter of the deadly virus, to asses the situation.Many cities except Wuhan had reported no new cases for consecutive days, leading to provincial leaders to conclude that restrictions can be lifted in order to get their economies back in business. While Xi emphasized maintaining a stringent virus control regime, he has also asked authorities to start bringing life back to normal. ANI

Voters will head to the polls to cast ballots in various races during this election year, 2020, the Year of the Rat.
 I believe the right to vote mandates a civic duty to be informed as much as possible on matters concerning our communities. When we don't have a choice of candidates to choose from, or if we are denied full and truthful disclosure in decisions made on our behalf, we run the risk of losing the focus of what is truly in the best interests of all.
 Isn't it our civic duty to voice concerns to elected officials, even if we risk verbal assault at the podium, personal attacks in social media and threats meant to silence? Dare we speak out in written formats such as this?
 Risking all, I am willing to publicly voice disapproval with Bedford Township officials - NOT the road commission's "choosing" to fund a round-about at the intersection of Smith and Jackman Roads. I don't disagree it could use improvement, but I have discovered the truths and project facts, not fully disclosed to taxpayers in "official documentation."
 A couple of months ago, Bedford social media was buzzing with inquiry of who bought the Michigan Tavern property. The answer is: You, the taxpayers of Bedford Township. Each owns 1/31,000 of contaminated property and this is just the tip of the iceberg as this unsolicited gift bears a hefty price greater than $600,000.
 In my opinion, a horrendous disservice has been dumped onto the laps of the taxpayers. Not only were we denied a voice and full disclosure but, more detrimental to our well- being, is the fact that certain officials began spending said money before acquiring ALL easements.
 As I see it, neglecting to choose the less costly but still viable option of moving the traffic light, hiding the process behind closed doors and ensuring under-the-table deals, makes the current choice a blatant misuse of public office and public monies.
 My statements are based upon a timeline of events per the Monroe County Road Commission starting September 2017; public statements during Bedford Township Board meetings and a Toledo Blade article dated March, 10, 2019.
 Taxpayers need a choice and deserve the best. Please research the options before casting your votes.

Don't think it can't happen here. Italy is already in lockdown. The Chinese communist party placed nearly 60 million people under effective house arrest in Hubei province.
 Fear of the sickness will be as important as the sickness itself. And that fear will be stoked by the novelty of the sickness.
 I have no wish to imitate those bluff dismissive commentators who cry 'keep calm and carry on' and expect to hear a round of applause for their no- nonsense common sense.
 We are moving into a new and more frightening world and no one can say where it will take us. Yet it remains true that the coronavirus will be accorded publicity accustomed killers never enjoy.
 Its novelty invests it with a dark glamour. The diminishing number who believe we have nothing to worry about can say, with justice, that on average seasonal flu kills 17,000 each winter and the media barely notices.
 The tens of thousands killed by the coronavirus will be an event. The death toll will be updated daily. Their grieving families will be interviewed. The virus will consume the nation's attention. Indeed it already has.
 The panic. The loss of reason, which is already seeing shoppers stockpiling enough food to keep them through a nuclear winter. The theft of communal medical supplies. The threat that GPs and hospitals will be overwhelmed, not only by genuinely sick patients, but the paranoid well. These events foretell a near future in which open-mindedness and altruism are replaced by suspicion and self-interest. Surely this is the polluted climate Donald Trump and Boris Johnson were born to thrive in.
 I do not believe they will - or rather I hope they won't - for a reason I alluded to at the start of this piece. Camus, Orwell and Arendt's dissections of the 20th century totalitarianism cannot be reliable guides to the strongmen of the 21st.
 Today's populist bosses do not follow the Nazi dictum 'if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it'. The lies of Johnson and Trump are not meant to be believed. They are an in-joke between the leader and his followers, which neither side takes too seriously.
 It's no accident that Trump came into politics from reality TV and Johnson from the comedy corner of the _Telegraph_ opinion pages and _Have I Got News for You_. They are post-modern figures who want their supporters to enjoy the performance rather than be governed effectively. Lying is just a part of the show.
 They give the fans the transgressive pleasure of seeing the authority figures - the liberals, the experts, the BBC, the _New York Times_ , the judges, the economists and the civil servants - trashed for the hell of it. They create enemies, and taunt and humiliate them. The price for the audience is accepting that the stream of lies and broken promises from the stars on stage don't matter.
 I thought we would have to wait to see if the audience would keep applauding when a hard or no-deal Brexit comes next year. But the virus has brought that moment closer.
 To put it bluntly, the time for leaders in clown costumes has passed. That joke isn't funny any more. Johnson and Trump look like comedians dying on stage now; living fossils from a world that was wiped out by a natural disaster.
 The position of the US, where tens of millions do not have medical cover was already bad enough. But the Trump administration has made it worse by failing to provide virus testing kits laboratories can work with.
 Johnson senses his own irrelevance, and has been hiding behind expert medical advisers since the crisis began.
 Camus thought hard about fear and its consequences. He wrote, conventionally enough, that a 'climate of fear is not one that encourages reflection'.
 But he did not then go into a conventional appeal for calm and rationality, but instead said we should recognise that fear moves us all. We should not and, more precisely, we could not dismiss it. Instead, we 'should try to find a remedy for it'.
 Remedies for global pandemics include disease proofing your country as far as is possible. You do it by ensuring your health service is well funded and staffed, and that you have adequate measures to ensure the social care of the elderly.
 When looking at the workforce, you would want generous sick pay mandated by law. You would be alert to the dangers of overbearing employers having the power to force insecure workers to come in however much of a danger they pose to their colleagues and the public. In short, we respond to the threats of our time by rebuilding the welfare state.
 More details of what a new settlement should look like will come as this crisis uncovers previously ignored faults in our society.
 But one point is already clear: disease-resistant countries cannot afford to have men like Johnson and Trump anywhere near power if they wish to stay healthy.

n ziua de 25 noiembrie 2019, Reed s-a simțit pentru prima dată cu adevărat rău: „Mi-am spus că e o simplă răceală”, a povestit el pentru Sky News. „Dar tocmai asta este problema cu noul coronavirus, evoluează în etape. Totul a început exact ca o răceală.”
 Medicii consideră că răceala s-ar fi putut suprapune cu virusul, fiind vorba de o coincidență, dar nu exclud nici varianta potrivit căreia bărbatul simțea deja simptome ale COVID-19.
 Reed a continuat să meargă la locul de muncă până când, la începutul lunii decembrie, a fost „lovit” de o gripă extrem de puternică. „Îmi era foarte rău. Tușeam îngrozitor și, mai apoi, mi-am pierdut vocea. Unul dintre prietenii mei irlandezi mi-a recomandat să beau whisky amestecat cu miere caldă și, sincer să fiu, asta chiar m-a ajutat. Desigur, nu afirm că rețeta ar fi un remediu împotriva coronavirusului, dar m-am simțit mai bine."
 Începând cu ziua respectivă, Connor a decis că nu se va mai întoarce la muncă o perioadă. Avea febră și nu voia să transmită boala colegilor săi. Locuitorii Chinei și ai întregii lumi nu știau încă despre virusul care avea să se răspândească în scurt timp pe Glob, infectând mii de oameni și provocând numeroase decese.
 Deși avea sinusurile inflamate și acuza dureri musculare intense, pentru Connor partea cea mai neplăcută a bolii nici nu se manifestase încă. Așteptând să se vindece de „gripă” și să revină la școală, tânărul s-a trezit într-o dimineață incapabil să mai respire. „M-am speriat foarte tare, credeam că voi muri.”
 Starea sa de sănătate nu s-a îmbunătățit, așa că a decis să meargă la spital. Pe 5 decembrie a făcut analize de sânge, radiografii și teste pentru boli respiratorii. Rezultatele primite în ziua următoare indicau doar pneumonie, diagnostic pe care Reed nu l-a considerat îngrijorător, cu atât mai mult cu cât acesta declară că are un stil de viață sănătos.   Câteva săptămâni mai târziu, medicii și-au dat seama că tânărul suferă de COVID-19, infecție care devenise deja o problemă atent urmărită în provincia chineză Hubei.
 Connor a povestit că, în miez de noapte, a primit o alertă pe telefonul mobil prin care era anunțată intrarea orașului în carantină. Acesta a reușit să își facă din timp provizii de alimente, lucru pentru care se felicită și acum.
 „Pe măsură ce au apărut cazuri noi și coronavirusul a început să se răspândească, Guvernul a aplicat sancțiuni tot mai dure și o carantină din ce în ce mai aspră." Reed a menționat că apreciază promptitudinea cu care autoritățile s-au ocupat de situația de criză, aplaudând măsurile luate pentru gestionarea problemei.

So we are not making too much out of the coronavirus threat. It is because we are making so much out of it that we Americans are not besieged as are people in other countries. Our medical experts also understand this disease could get out of hand quick if we aren’t aggressive with prevention.
 We do not want to know the outcome of a ho-hum attitude. Extreme measures? Absolutely. To avoid extreme consequences.
 The news media is not overreacting. Real news people are citing real numbers and actual experts who are trying to arm us with knowledge we need.
 Humans are congregational. It’s a strength, for sure, and at times a weakness. We prop up each other and also share our illnesses because our lives closely intertwine. Thus, it’s a convoluted situation: We should not panic, but we are in a state of emergency.
 Perform a Web search for “influenza world war 1.” Take a look at those numbers and decide if our posture today is over the top.
 We have the smartest people in medical science telling us what to do to minimize coronavirus exposure and lower the odds for infection. For that, I am grateful. I do not want thousands of people to show up as losses in a database.
 In my lifetime, I — like many of you — have seen too many new ways to die to downplay a proactive approach to a deadly virus that we may as well say popped up out of nowhere.
 I treated obituaries with respect and compassion when I was a full-time journalist. A rule was not required to tell me that attitude is correct.
 Many people set a high priority on reading all the obits in the newspaper. Be that as it may, it was always a good day when the number of obits were down. I hope it stays that way

When I did venture out, the thing I found striking was the lack of masks. Regardless of whether they are effective or not, every time I read something about the virus, it was accompanied by photographs of people in masks.
 But out on the streets, I hardly saw any. Since the start of the scare, I can count the number of people I've seen wearing them - and this is in the epicentre of the Italian outbreak - on both hands.
 After a while, I did start to go back to normal. I couldn't work because the schools were closed, but I was going out for walks, shopping and having lunch with friends. And so, apparently, was everyone else. At this stage, there were only six confirmed cases in the immediate region, so the attitude seemed to be that things could still carry on as normal as possible.
 A week after the school closures were announced, my tutor got in touch to say there was a plan to reopen on March 4. I breathed a sigh of relief. Not only did things seem to be going back to normal, but I might also get paid again. (The enforced time off had seen my funds take a bit of a beating.)
 Then came the big spike in cases, and deaths, announced on Monday, March 2. There would be no school reopening that week, or for the foreseeable future. The following day was the first time I really noticed a change. I went for a walk to get out of the house and the city was empty. I walked along a main bus and tram route and each vehicle that passed me had less than six people on board.
 There were few other people out walking and more shops were staying shut. It finally felt real - very different from the relatively relaxed week before. There was genuine fear. The virus had been spreading at an alarming rate. People were concerned about loved ones.
 It was at this point that I decided to go back to the UK. There is no prospect of the schools reopening before at least Easter and, unsurprisingly, people are not that keen on having babysitters around. There was also the possibility that if I did not fly to the UK now, I would not be able to later.
 Of course, I have concerns about leaving, not just because I have a home and a job in Turin, but because I am worried for my loved ones in the UK. I know that, completely unwittingly, there is a chance I could be infected (I have no symptoms) and could put them in danger, especially my grandma who suffers from COPD.
 But I have to remain rational. We have had 108 cases in the entire region and only 19 in Turin; 61 of those infected are in recovery. So what are the odds?
 I flew home at the beginning of this week, just as the Italian government announced its most drastic measures yet, with up to 16 million people in northern areas covered by quarantine restrictions. (Since my return, these restrictions have been extended to cover the entire country.) As I left, the sun was shining more than it had been last week, and the city seemed less empty than before.
 Whether this is a good thing or not, I cannot say, but the weather did give me optimism. Italy's is an open and friendly lifestyle. It is not suited to outbreaks or to quarantine. I only hope that I can go back there soon.

Harry, the artist formerly known as prince, rather appropriately chose Commonwealth Day for his last public engagement this week, celebrating an institution formerly known as the British empire.
 I used to think that the Commonwealth was pointless but harmless. I now think it nostalgic and dangerous. It is a fantasy for Britain to think that a club of former colonies, tied to Britain by little more than sentimentality, is an alternative to engagement in our own European continent. And it is positively dangerous for key Commonwealth states themselves, notably India, who use it as a cloak for tyranny.
 For the biggest Commonwealth event of recent days wasn't the pageant led by the House of Windsor in Westminster Abbey. It was the rioting which has targeted Muslims on the streets of Delhi, without one word of protest from the Commonwealth.
 Lest you think India out on a limb, note that homosexuality is still illegal in 34 of the 54 members of the Commonwealth. What is the organisation doing to overcome this? Zilch.
 Back in 1949, when the Commonwealth was founded, it meant something because the empire had not ended. On the contrary, the new organisation was a ploy by Attlee and Bevin, leading the post-war Labour government, to create a viable post-war structure for trade, politics and citizenship embracing a large number of continuing colonies, the 'white' dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and newly-independent republics, notably India, which still had extensive British ties. They roped in the monarchy to give it glitz, making King George VI 'Head of the Commonwealth', in which role he was succeeded by his daughter Elizabeth three years later, who came to the throne while on a Commonwealth tour of Africa.

After importing medical supplies to Lebanon for 20 years, Hassan Hamdan shut his business in December. Sales were plummeting, clients couldnt pay, and the dollars he needed to buy imports had dried up. Now he drives an Uber.Businesses such as Hamdans have been shutting at a rapid rate since a financial crisis exacerbated by months of political instability has brought much of Lebanons economy to a halt. Everyone is in debt - even me - because of whats happening. But Im able to afford food for the house and a few bills. Without Uber, I would be begging, said Hamdan, 37.While Lebanon produces little hard, up-to-date economic data, interviews with two dozen business owners, union leaders, industry groups and traders paint a picture of an economic and financial crisis without precedent since independence in 1943. More than 220,000 jobs in the private sector have been shed since mid-October when protests fuelled by worsening economic conditions erupted against the political elite, according to a survey in February.Its a social catastrophe, said Ramzi El Hafez, general manager of InfoPro, the research firm behind the survey. This is the heaviest one-shot drop since the end of the civil war ... There is no end in sight. It is an open-ended crisis. A fifth of workers in the hotel industry, a traditional engine of the economy, have been laid off and in the southern city of Sidon, one in five shops has already shut down.The job losses since October are a major blow to Lebanons employed workforce, which the International Labour Organisation estimated at just 1.59 million in a 2019 report. Importers of critical goods such as medical supplies say their requests for dollars have gone almost entirely unmet since February, leaving many hospitals dangerously low on everything from heart stents to dialysis equipment.Almost all the work has come to a halt. Were unable to do anything, said Mohamad Sukkar, who owns a contracting company. His business is frozen, stuck between banks that will not cash cheques and suppliers demanding payment in dollars he cannot get. Weve had to close down all the work and were not taking up any new work, said Sukkar.Hard hit businesses were dealt yet another blow this week as Lebanon ordered malls, restaurants and other venues to close to stop the spread of the coronavirus, as well as halting flights from the worst hit countries. AFRAID TO BRING IN GOODSLebanese banks have attracted huge foreign inflows for years by offering some of the regions highest interest rates, allowing the country to pay for imports despite low exports. But inflows have fallen sharply in recent years along with economic growth, dragged down by regional turmoil, a nine-year war in Syria and strained relations with wealthy Gulf states.Lebanese expats who had been propping up the economy with remittances, meanwhile, started to hold back funds as banks began imposing strict controls which now limit withdrawals for regular customers to as little as 100 a week. The situation has deteriorated since the political crisis to the point where Lebanon said this month it cant repay its sovereign debt as well as pay for essential imports.Virtually locked out of the banking system, importers have struggled to keep up with the rising price of dollars. The Lebanese pound has lost about 40 of its value since October, hiking the price of everyday imported goods. As dollars grow increasingly scarce, the countrys import-dependent supply chain has slowed to a crawl.Traders of foodstuffs say they have slashed imports by 30-40. Industrialists say theyre struggling to source raw materials. Consumers and businesses gripe about rising prices and slumping sales. Were getting to the stage where were afraid to bring in goods, said Mohammed Yakoub, who supplies restaurants. His sales have slumped 70 since October as the economic crisis takes its toll on businesses.At least 785 restaurants, cafes and nightclubs went belly-up from September through February, with 240 shut in January alone, according to the sectors main union. There will be more unemployment, there will be a big exodus, people will look for work abroad, we are already seeing this. We will lose yet another batch of good workers that we would have liked to retain in the country, said union general secretary Maya Bekhazi.RUNNING OUT OF WHEAT Among the tell-tale signs that dollar flows are getting even more critical is what traders describe as a near halt in a central bank process launched in September to secure foreign currency for critical goods - medicine, fuel, and wheat.The central bank has stopped transfers for all operations related to importing wheat for about a month. It is completely shut down, so now we are in the process of running out of stocks, said Crown Mills flour mill owner Paul Mansour. Mansour said mills unable to pay foreign suppliers were considering asking the government to import grain The stocks have decreased and within 40 days will be depleted.Many cities outside Beirut appear harder hit. South of the capital in Sidon, its once bustling market is lined with empty storefronts up for rent. Even the shops you still see open are unable to sell anything, said shopkeeper Abdullah Merzoub. Things are getting harder.The head of the Sidon trade association, Ali al-Shareef, said 120 of the citys 600 shops have closed since October and he expected the number to double in the next few months. Were headed toward a bigger and bigger collapse, he said.Emptied of guests, hotels have laid off 20 of their workforce and put the rest on half-time, said Pierre Achkar, head of Lebanons hotel federation. This is the lowest occupancy rate Ive seen in 50 years, he said. If the summer is bad, I think we will have a lot of hotels that will close.Many companies, such as Chip, which provides security systems, said they were staying in business despite heavy losses only because shutting down and reopening would be more costly. Chip chief executive Hady Nahas said he was keeping his 72 employees on even though turnover was only 15 of what it was a year ago - but he would be forced to do something dramatic by the end of the year if things dont improve.Were draining our personal resources as owners. Theres a limit, and I dont know if the situation will be resolved ... before we break, said Nahas.

And if the last name Cecchini looks familiar, it should. Evan is the son of Dave and Tammy Cecchini — the head football coach and head women’s tennis coach at Bucknell University.                                                                                                                          Evan Cecchini is a United States Tennis Association-sanctioned player, and his addition to the team should pay off handsomely for Lewisburg this season.                                                                                                                          Cecchini’s arrival certainly has Lewisburg coach Sam Harer really looking forward for the season to start on Monday.                                                                                                                          “I’m excited for this season,” said Harer. “I have all my returning starters, plus (Cecchini), who has lots of experience playing tennis.”                                                                                                                          Cecchini has already been slotted into the No. 1 singles spot for the Green Dragons this year, and he will join junior Zach Higgins and senior Cole Temple to form a potent singles unit.                                                                                                                          “With his experience and skills, I think he will help the rest of the team to become better players, said Harer in regards to Cecchini. “It feels great to bring back everyone from last year, and with a new addition on top of that.”                                                                                                                          Fellow senior Sawyer Fisher, who played at No. 3 singles last year, has been bumped down to doubles with the addition of Cecchini, and is projected to form a strong No. 1 doubles team with senior David Han.                                                                                                                          “The seniors who will play a big roll this year are Temple and Fisher, both of whom have started three seasons for me,” said Harer. “They have excellent leadership skills and great sportsmanship, which are great qualities to have.”                                                                                                                          With all of that experience returning, Harer says the expectations are big going into the season.                                                                                                                          “The goal is to win a District 4 Team Championship,” he said.                                                                                                                          That goal is definitely attainable, especially since Central Columbia, the two-time defending district team champions, has lost most of last year’s team including two-time individual district champ John Duncan, along with talented No. 2 player Conor Ryan.                                                                                                                          Expect Lewisburg, which has fallen to Central in both of those finals matches, to get the better of the Blue Jays this year.                                                                                                                          “I feel that last year’s experiences will help this year since all of my players are returning,” said Harer, whose team fell to Central 3-1 a year ago before falling to Lancaster Country Day in the first round of states, 5-0. “They know what it’s like playing in big matches in the playoffs and in championship matches, not to mention playing in the state tournament.”

Production on Tom Hanks' upcoming Elvis Presley movie has been halted after the actor and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for the coronavirus.
 The 63-year-old took to social media on Thursday to tell fans that he and Rita were in isolation in Australia, upon the advice of medical officials.
 "Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches," he wrote on Twitter and Instagram. "Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive."
 The Oscar winner was in Australia for pre-production on director Baz Luhrmann's upcoming film about Elvis, in which Tom is set to star as the rocker's manager Colonel Tom Parker.
 However, following Tom and Rita's diagnosis, production on the movie has come to a temporary halt.
 "We have been made aware that a company member from our Elvis feature film, which is currently in pre-production in The Gold Coast, Australia, has tested positive for COVID-19 (coronavirus)," a Warner Bros. spokesperson said in a statement. "We are working closely with the appropriate Australian health agencies to identify and contact anyone who may have come in direct contact with the individual. The health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world. The individual who tested positive for COVID-19 is currently receiving treatment."
 It's unclear at this stage whether Tom's co-stars, including Austin Butler, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Rufus Sewell, have been tested for the virus.

The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to accord urgent hearing on a petition seeking postponement of the Indian Premier League-2020 amid the coronavirus scare. A vacation bench of justices U U Lalit and Aniruddha Bose told the petitioner that he could mention the matter for urgent listing before the regular bench on March 16, when the apex court will re-open after the Holi break.This is not a matter which cannot await till re-opening of the court. You can mention it before the regular court on March 16, the bench told advocate Mohan Babu Agarwal, who has filed the petition. Agarwal told the bench that the Indian Premier League IPL-2020 is scheduled to start from March 29 and would continue for almost two months, but no safety measures have been declared to prevent the spread of coronavirus during the matches, which are likely to witness over 40,000 spectators in each match. We are sitting in a vacation bench. We will hear those matters which cannot wait. All IPL matches will not start on March 29. You can mention it on March 16, the bench said.The number of coronavirus patients in India has risen to 73 with 13 fresh cases, the Union health ministry said on Thursday. Agarwal told the apex court that during the IPL, players, commentators and broadcasters from foreign countries which are hit by coronavirus would come to India and there is a possibility of spread of the virus during large gatherings in such matches. This IPL is just a domestic professional tournament with no contribution to ICC records and is a private tournament and the risk in the times of Covid-19 coronavirus is quite high due to huge crowd gathering including players, staff, cheerleaders etc, the plea said.They BCCI and other concerned authorities should explain how they are going to deal with the recent threat of Covid-19 and is it not the right time to either postpone or defer the same to future date as the threat is apparent in all probabilities looking into the present scenario, it said, while referring to number of coronavirus cases in several countries and deaths caused due to it. The plea has arrayed the Centre, ministries of health and law, Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI, IPL administration and IPL teams as parties in the matter.It has sought a direction to the Centre to take effective, strong and war footing steps to curb the outbreak of coronavirus. The plea has also sought a direction to either stop, postpone or defer for future dates all such huge programs like IPL etc, avoiding large public gathering for the time being till it coronavirus is being controlled. While seeking a direction to scrap IPL matches, the plea has sought appropriate action against BCCI, IPL administration and teams participating in the tournament for allegedly violating the law and undermining the government directives on large public gatherings looking to the recent threat of Covid-19 outbreak in the interest of justice.It said the eight teams, which will participate in IPL, will have up to 200 players, including 50-60 foreign cricketers, and 120 support staff who would be directly involved in the matches and there is also a threat as autograph seekers come in direct contact and close proximity with players. The plea claimed that Japan, which will host 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, has said that the games could be held later in the year and might not start on July 24 as planned due to coronavirus. It said that worldwide, several sporting events have been postponed amid the spread of coronavirus. PTI ABA MNL SJK SRY.

Rubber is made up of various polymers which helps in the usage of it in many industries. There are two different types of rubber which are, natural rubber and synthetic rubber. Natural rubbers are obtained from the rubber trees which consist of isoprene which is an organic compound, and polymers. There are very few impurities found in the obtained rubber. Indonesia and Malaysia are the leading players of natural rubber. Synthetic rubber is also called as artificial rubber or elastomer.

We can't hide under the table with a pandemic virus hoping it doesn't get to us, it's already out there in the poulation and will continue to be for a long time to come. What is required at this time is wise and calm precautionary measures within the bounds of reason. Panic will lead to societal breakdown, as we are already seeing in Italy.

Some economies were already slowing before the viral outbreak even began to cause massive disruptions, first in central China where the virus originated and gradually across Asia.

Global equities and oil prices fell through the floor again on Thursday after Donald Trump banned all travel from mainland Europe to the US for a month to fight the coronavirus, ramping up fears the global economy will careen into recession. The news came after the World Health Organization officially labelled the outbreak a pandemic and hit out at alarming levels of inaction for its spread.Asian equity markets, already deep in the red in reaction to the WHO announcement, cratered after Trumps address. Tokyo ended down 4.4 per cent, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20 per cent from a recent high, while Sydney lost 7.4 per cent in the ASX 200s worst day since the 2008 financial crisis.Hong Kong fell 3.7 per cent, though Shanghai was off 1.5 per cent as China continues to see infection rates slow. Seoul, Singapore and Jakarta lost more than three per cent, Mumbai tanked more than six per cent and Wellington slid five per cent, while Taipei retreated 4.3 per cent.Manila crashed 10 per cent -- sparking a brief trading halt -- after it emerged Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte would undergo a precautionary test for the virus, while his finance minister and head of the central bank were among several officials who were to go into quarantine. It ended down 9.7 per cent. Bangkok also triggered an automatic halt by falling 10 per cent.In early trade London and Paris each plunged 4.5 per cent, while Frankfurt dived five per cent. Gulf markets also tumbled, with Riyadh down more than 4.0 per cent. The Japanese yen, a key haven in times of crisis, jumped more than one per cent against the dollar.Travel restrictions equal slower global economic activity, so if you need any more coaxing to sell... after a massively negative signal from trading in US markets it just fell in your lap, said AxiCorps Stephen Innes. The losses followed another brutal session on Wall Street, where the Dow fell into a bear market and futures pointed Thursday to another rout.The coronavirus outbreak has left virtually no sector untouched, though travel and tourism have been particularly hard-hit as countries institute travel bans and quarantine requirements, with Italy in a country-wide lockdown. The number of cases across the globe has risen to more than 126,000 with 4,600 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.In announcing the Europe ban -- which excludes Britain -- Trump said the continent had seen a surge in new cases because governments failed to stop travel from China, where the COVID-19 epidemic began. He said the prohibitions would also apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, and various other things as we get approval.However, the White House afterwards clarified that the people transporting goods will not be admitted into the country, but the goods will be. Oil prices were also hammered, with both main contracts falling around six per cent at one point before edging back slightly. The oil market was already under pressure after Saudi Arabia and Gulf partner UAE stepped up a price war with plans to flood global markets.We are now staring at the whole world going into a lockdown, Vandana Hari, of Vanda Insights, said. Oil demand can be expected to crash through the floor and all previous projections on oil consumption are now out the door. The Saudi move was the latest escalation of a fight among oil producers after Russia balked at an OPEC-backed plan to cut production in response to lost demand because of the coronavirus. Markets are crying out for a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 headwinds and a lack of concrete US policy action is rattling markets, said Tapas Strickland, senior analyst at National Australia Bank.Trumps address included several measures intended to ease the financial burden particularly for small business, including payroll tax relief and deferred tax payments. But he did not unveil any large-scale tax cuts, which OANDAs Jefrey Halley said has probably disappointed markets more than anything.The bloodbath across global trading floors has come despite a raft of measures by governments worth at least 150 billion to offset the impact of the outbreak, while central banks will be called upon to cut already low interest rates and introduce other fiscal measures. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will do whatever is necessary to help the economy, while the European Central Bank is to hold a policy meeting later in the day at which it is under pressure to open up the taps..

Added Arce, in an email to the AP: “Jeanine or Oprah were not there to answer questions. They were there to defend the book. I understand it. When we tried to push Oprah and Jeanine, they were unwilling to really dig deep."
