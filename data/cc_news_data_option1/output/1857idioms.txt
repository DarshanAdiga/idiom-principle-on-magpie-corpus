Coronavirus hasn't been a "win" for anyone, to say the least. Though many digital businesses are reporting increased demand for their services -- Etsy included -- thousands of lives directly affected by the virus itself and the tens of millions of lives indirectly affected due to job loss is simply heartbreaking news. The coronavirus pandemic has created a Catch-22 in the purest sense of the term: Respond to the health crisis by shutting down the economy, and many will lose work; respond to the economic crisis and leave the economy open (or open it back up too soon), and the virus could resume its spread and put stress on the healthcare system. It would be wrong to call Etsy a winner because of the crisis, but the company did its part in addressing both sides of the Catch-22.

While the numbers are not as high as other localities, Laurier said it is too early to tell whether counties have peaked. Presently, the health department is not offering testing to residents, but some private health care providers are offering testing in the counties.
 According to King William County Administrator Bobbie Tassinari, when Northam gives the state the green light to begin Phase 1 it will be up to the businesses to decide whether or not they will open their doors. She expects businesses will take the guidelines seriously and will work to ensure folks stay safe.
 “I do believe that business owners and their employees have a very good grasp on what this virus can do and has done and want to follow the governor’s guidelines as well as the U.S. Center’s for Disease Control,” Tassinari said in an email. “Reopening just to close again isn’t something anyone wants.”
 King and Queen County Administrator Thomas Swartzwelder agreed. Placing trust in the county’s business owners, he said it will be up to the businesses as to whether or not they want to reopen their doors.
 “Our business owners are our friends and neighbors and I trust the business owners in King and Queen County to weigh the issues and to make decisions that are in the best interest of the community,” Swartzwelder stated in an email.
 Both counties report they will wait for Northam’s instructions before reopening county buildings.
 In New Kent County, the Chickahominy Health District reported 26 confirmed cases and one death, Public Health Manager Caitlin Hodge said.
 While several people in the county have recovered from coronavirus, Hodge said she cannot fully report that the county has seen its peak in cases as testing is still in the early stages. The department is working with the New Kent Fire Department to further implement inclusive testing at a more rapid rate in order to have more accurate data.

PLATTEKILL - Virtual learning has ended up in homes, kitchen tables, and living rooms. While the challenge of this may seem hard for many families, schools are working equally as hard to keep things "normal' for students at home.
   
 At Plattekill Elementary, providing students with a news broadcast on a weekly basis has been happening for the past four years. PNN, the Pawsitive News Network, works with students that applied for the job in Grades 5 and 6. Stephen Cabarcas, Technology Integration Specialist, and Lori Williams, Intervention Specialist, are the editors, producers, and directors of the program.
   
 Each week you can hear the weather, calendar events, character education, science and math facts, tech tips, and healthy food tips just to name a few segments. The events surrounding the closure of school abruptly ended the normalcy for many students and their families. Providing students with a virtual PNN was important for Williams and Cabarcas to continue.
   
 Through the use of ZOOM, PNN was able to get back up and running, proving the show must go on. Shows are posted every Monday on Cubby Central, the PTA Facebook page. Social media has been vital to keeping out students feel engaged with their classmates. There is also the weekly "Virtual Spirit Weeks" which fill their Facebook page with students and families happy and engaged.

NEW YORK (WPIX/CNN) - A New York family is dealing with the loss of their matriarch and her missing jewelry.The daughters of a woman who died in a Brooklyn hospital said no one knows what happened to their mother's rings.Arlene Greene was already vulnerable. At age 87 and diabetic, her body couldn't put up much of a fight against COVID-19."By the time we took our mother to the hospital, we were scared to death for her. And the only thing we were thinking about was trying to get her some help," daughter Allyson Beard said.After spending a week in a Brookyln hospital, she died alone."We couldn't see her, couldn't speak with her. We couldn't' pray with her," Beard said.Without any visitors or family members allowed inside, Greene's family said they had to rely on hospital staff for guidance."There was absolutely nothing from the hospital at all," Beard said. "We had to call them to say, 'What are we supposed to do? How do we collect her belongings?'"Instead of being able to grieve, her daughters feel violated, searching for answers and their mother's valuables. Her three gold and diamond rings are missing."On the property, patient property form, it said, it indicated that our mother had four rings, three with stones, and that they were too tight to remove from her body," Beard said.But her rings were not in the bag of belongings Greene's daughters picked up, raising not only concern but adding to their devastation.They continued reaching out to the hospital for help, also notifying the funeral home about their mother's rings, without any answers."It was just a shock to my heart," Beard said.Greene's daughters filed a police report and reached out to Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams.Under normal circumstances, there is communication between the hospital and patients’ families through patient relations, but COVID-19 is affecting that. Brooklyn Hospital didn’t respond to a request for a comment.In the meantime, the Brooklyn Borough President's Office is looking into this to make sure no other family has to go through what the Greenes are going through.Her daughters say their mother's rings tell a love story of her 56 years of marriage, and now they can't fulfill their mother's last wishes."My mother was a fighter and she would have wanted us to do whatever we could do to try to bring some kind of justice to this situation, and that's what we feel we have to do," Beard said.The Brooklyn Borough president is looking to meet with hospital administrators to see what can be done to safeguard patient property.Some suggestions have been getting a patient advocate or a lock box.Copyright 2020 WPIX via CNN.

 The relief package, which includes economic measures earlier announced to tackle COVID-19 and steps also announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in this regard, comes up to a total of Rs 20 lakh crore. This, the prime minister said, is around 10 percent of India's gross domestic product (GDP).

 En concreto, Arriaga detalla que el dinero de la televisión insular se reinvertirá en el Plan de Choque para “los más necesitados en estos momentos económicamente tan complicados con la idea de dinamizar la economía de la isla” y recuerda que “ya en agosto del año pasado eliminamos la marca “Tenerife 2030” que era otro elemento de publicidad que carecía de contexto”.

For a few minutes, in 1986, the emblem was in full flower, right there in “Down and Out in Beverly Hills,” Paul Mazursky’s hit satire, with Richard Dreyfuss, Nick Nolte and Bette Midler. Little Richard plays the record producer who lives across the street from Dreyfuss and Midler, the Whitemans. Not even 20 minutes in, he pops out in a bathrobe, gold chain, his juiciest Jheri curl and foulest mood. The occasion is his neighbors’ false alarm, which unleashes at least one chopper and a flood of concerned cops.
 “I know why I don’t get the protection that I’m supposed to get,” Little Richard says, “Because I’m black!” He’s not so much saying this as much as he is exclaiming it, performing it, braying it. He even throws in a “good God Almighty.” These are street preacher antics. “I spent $3.6 million for that pile of stucco you see over _there_!” When he runs off, exasperated, he’s still ranting: “I’m bringing in _more_ brothers, _more_ brothers,” then lets out a “woo.”
 As you watch him go on, you notice that, for once, he isn’t laughing. He seems _pained_ to have to make this known. His alarm was real.
 Maybe part of the reason we tolerated Little Richard the way we did was because he actually took it easy on us. He seemed frozen in the era of his genius, living with abandon until he died. Was that an illusion brought on by that name? He was born one Richard Penniman and exited 87 years later, a Little. How seriously do we take our Littles? Do we believe in their rage? It’s likely that when Little Richard ranted about tragedy, we heard an adult child. We heard a gay comedian. We heard an aunt.

Instagram has come under fire for not doing enough to combat online bullying. About 59 percent of US teens have been bullied or harassed online, and most think social media sites are doing a fair or poor job of addressing this issue, according to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center. Anti-bullying group Ditch the Label found in 2017 that 42% of 12- to 20-year-olds surveyed in the UK who were bullied online experienced the problem on Instagram.
 Outside of bullying, images of suicide and self-harm have been another woe facing Instagram. In 2017, British teenager Molly Russell took her life, and her family partly blamed the social network for her death. Russell had used Instagram to engage with and post content about depression and suicide.
 In the first quarter, Instagram said, the site took action on 1.3 million pieces of content about suicide or self-injury, up from more than 896,800 pieces of content in the fourth quarter of 2019. Instagram found nearly 90% of this content in the first quarter before users reported it to the social network, it said.

"It can be done fast & safely," the president tweeted, joining many of Musk's 34 million Twitter followers who back the defiance.
 Among Musk's biggest critics is California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, who used an expletive to describe the CEO after his threats to relocate his operations to Texas or Nevada. She said the company is disregarding worker safety and bullying public officials.
 Tesla's factory reopened Monday with Musk practically daring local authorities to arrest him. The plant apparently continued operations on Tuesday, and it wasn't clear whether Tesla met a 5 p.m. PDT deadline to submit a site-specific plan to protect worker safety.
 The restart defied orders from the Alameda County Public Health Department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can't fully open under virus restrictions. The department said Monday it warned the company was operating in violation of the county health order, and hoped Tesla will "comply without further enforcement measures" until the county approves a site-specific plan required by the state.
 The department said it expected Tesla to submit such a plan by 5 p.m. Monday. "We look forward to reviewing Tesla's plan and coming to agreement on protocol and a timeline to reopen safely," the statement read.
 A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla on whether the company met the deadline.
 State law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.
 The plant in Fremont, a city of more than 230,000 people south of San Francisco, had been closed since March 23. It employs about 10,000 workers.

GRIFFIN, Ga. (WGCL/CNN) - Police in a Georgia city say a 12-year-old boy is dead after his 5-year-old brother shot him with an abandoned gun in the bushes.Authorities in Griffin say the two boys and their 7-year-old sister were playing outside Saturday evening when the deadly shooting happened. The gun used in the shooting may have been discarded Saturday afternoon during a police pursuit when three men got away from the scene, leaving behind drugs.“The children were out here peacefully playing in the backyard on the trampoline, neighbor Tom Whitehead told WGCL, describing the scene just before the shooting.The 5-year-old told police he thought the gun was a toy when he found it and shot his older brother in the chest. The gun was found near where the drugs were recovered.Police are now turning their attention toward finding out who is responsible for discarding the gun.“We will leave no stone unturned as we search for the individuals responsible for the abandonment of this weapon,” Griffin Police Chief Mike Yates said.

Victorian gardens reached their glory when a worldwide gardening frenzy erupted with the introduction of new and exotic plant varieties being discovered around the globe. It was a time when those fabled plant explorers were in their heyday. Some folks confuse Victorian gardens with cottage gardens, when in fact the two garden approaches were quite different.
   
 Victorian gardens were famous for their gaudy enormous foliage plants, huge colorful blossoms and unique bed designs. It wasn't unusual to see a Victorian flower bed in a paisley shape or a circular or oval mound topped with dramatic exotic plants. And many of those dramatic Victorian plants were crinums, flowering bulb plants with handsome trumpet-like blooms. Crinums were all the rage in Victorian times. And gardeners today are discovering these amazing plants.
   
 "Crinums were an aristocratic plant for may years. It was only the very rich who had them," explained Tony Avent, noted horticulturalist, garden writer at Plant Delights Nursery.
   
 Here in Florida, plantsman Henry Nehrling and others were working on hybridizing them in the early 1900s. And for a time, only the best Southern gardens sported the newest and showiest crimuns. Then things changed.
   
 Avent explained that as neighborhoods evolved and their residents moved to newer homes, the hardy crinum lilies proved to be almost impossible to transplant.
   
 "It was just too much trouble to dig them up and move them," he said. "Crinums, like amaryllis, have contractile roots -- roots that actually pull them (deeper) into the ground."
   
 The bulbs also can achieve enormous sizes, weighing up to 40 pounds. Plants themselves can grow to 6 feet tall and cover substantial areas of ground.
   
 It might even have been their hardiness that led to their diminished popularity. Gardeners do tend to obsess over rare and finicky plants, while dismissing those that seem common and easy to grow. It wasn't long before crinums became "the plant of the lowers class -- a pass-a-long plant found mostly in poor neighborhoods," Avent added.
   
 But those very qualities that attracted Victorian gardeners to crinums have attracted gardeners today. Crinums are bursting into bloom now in gardens all around. This varied family has some 130 species, a few of which are hardy down to 26 degrees. The most common crinum found in the state is the spider lily (Crinum americanum), with tattered-looking pure white blooms atop strap-like foliage. Although many crinums are from Asia and Africa, the fragrant spider lily is a Florida native. It can often be found growing wild in wetlands and alongside streams.
   
 Crinum culture is fairly easy, as might be expected. Plant the bulbs (or plants) in a location with good drainage, rich soil amended with compost in full sun or very light shade. Allow enough space -- several feet on all sides -- for the plant to grow and expand. Plant bulbs with the tips of the bulbs just below the soil surface, watering in well. Avent recommends purchasing crinum plants rather than bulbs, because the bulbs do not fare well in dry storage and may not produce healthy plants.
   
 Plants will take off once the weather gets hot, though they may not flower their first season, especially when starting with bulbs. Here in this part of the state, many may experience die-back in the winter due to cold temperatures. But most are hardy to this zone and will grow back if nipped by the cold.
   
 Insect pests are few, but can be substantial if not controlled. In particular the lubber grasshopper.
   
 "They are a great food for our lubber grasshoppers," quipped Mary Collins, senior horticulturalist at Fairchild Tropical Garden in Coral Gables.
   
 This has limited the use of crinums in the gardens there because the garden staff and volunteers had trouble keeping up with the voracious insects and the crinum collection there is contained in the garden arboretum. Removing or squashing the clusters of baby lubbers which hatch out in the spring it a good defense against the damage the grasshoppers can cause. Crinums can be affected by a red blotch fungus or criumn mosaic potyvirus which causes yellow streaks on the foliage. Spider mites can also be a problem.
   
 But for the most part, these hardy perennials live up to their reputation for a lot of show for a little effort. Flowers can range from pure white to variegated red and white to pink and on to deeper shades of red. Foliage of the spectacular C. procerum Splendens is reddish-purple. This handsome crinum can grow to 6 feet tall or taller. Many provide dramatic focal points in the landscape due in part to their large size and foliage.
   
 If you are moving or dividing a crinum, it is best to do so in the winter when plants are dormant. Dig around the clump, lift and then remove offshoot bulbs to plant elsewhere. Crinums can be planted in large containers with success. Plant propagation can also be by seed in non-hybrid species (seedlings are often not true to type) or by use of side shoots for most varieties.
   
 Select one for a specimen planting or several for a grand statement. Whatever your choice, crinum lilies represent a noble legacy of Southern garden heritage.
