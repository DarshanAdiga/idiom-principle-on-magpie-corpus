He would need help to complete the ballots, load up the boats and send them across the ocean to America, of course, so anyone unwilling to help would be eaten by hungry dogs.

In recent news, operational tech (OT) security company Claroty announced a massive collaboration with CrowdStrike. The deal will see the integration of the Claroty Platform and CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform. The integration allows customers to access their OT and information tech (IT) assets all on the Claroty Platform. Furthermore, it also provides enhanced threat detection across OT/IT boundaries without the need for any extra services. This results in more efficient OT/IT security governance and strengthened security posture across the board. Altogether, this could be an attractive offer for organizations looking to bolster their cybersecurity measures. Given all this, would you consider CRWD stock for your portfolio?

At quarter end, we had a $52 billion funded corporate loan portfolio of which over 75% is secured, with the majority of the remainder to large investment-grade borrowers. Certain industries remain in focus in light of the ongoing pandemic, including oil and gas, gaming and lodging and airline sectors. Our total funded exposure to these sectors is roughly $7 billion. Additionally, a significant portion of these loans are secured by hard assets, where we would expect recovery rates to be manageable.

Schmidt's analysis finds the strategy could get vaccines to 12.3 million more vulnerable people in the early phases of distribution compared with the population-based method.
 Any distribution system will reverberate across the nation, with consequences for everyone. It will be shaped by the early steps of federal officials and by state leaders who will allocate vaccines in the months when there is not enough supply to go around. California and several other states have stated that they intend to direct some of their supply to disadvantaged neighborhoods, but there's no national strategy to do so.
 No vaccine has been authorized for use yet in the U.S., but the preliminary results of ongoing clinical trials have been encouraging for Moderna’s and Pfizer’s candidates. If the Food and Drug Administration allows emergency use of one or both of those vaccines, there will be limited, rationed supplies before the end of the year.
 Operation Warp Speed officials announced last week that states would receive vaccine in proportion to their adult populations, at least for the first 6.4 million doses and possibly beyond.
 “We thought it best to keep it simple,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. “We thought that would be the fairest approach, the most consistent.”
 Fairness isn't that simple, Schmidt said.
 “Allocating vaccines to states according to population does not help reduce inequity,” Schmidt said. Vulnerable people will face more rationing in states such as New Mexico that have higher shares of vulnerable people. “That’s not fair.”

Black opals are central to the plot in Celeste, most spectacularly in a ­constellation-like diamond and emerald pendant necklace. (Any potential client hung up on the myth that opals are bad luck should note that this has been debunked countless times: as a hoax originated by Cleopatra, so she could hoard the Roman Empire's best stones; as a misreading of a scene in a 19th- century novel; or, most likely, as a conspiracy begun by 19th-century diamond dealers to squash the opal's burgeoning popularity. "We use a lot of incredible opals," Amfitheatrof says. "And our clients love them.")
 Yellow sapphires star in Soleils, the standout piece being a multi­-tier necklace engineered to project volume and lightness at the same time, and the Astre Rouge chapter turns on the aforementioned 8-carat ruby.
 The chapters' organizing principles are a product of Amfitheatrof's crystal clear vision for Vuitton and her desire to create a strong, distinct "jewelry vocabulary" for the house--but this should not lead you to assume that she is rigid in her approach. Her designs are armed with her belief in the wonders of the universe and the power of the artisans at the Vuitton atelier on Place Vendome where, she says, "everything is possible."

GRAND RAPIDS -- The Republican Ottawa County clerk spent much of his Wednesday evening not just watching the House Oversight Committee hearing, but also fact-checking in real-time on social media.
   
 "I owe that to the people who put me in office and the people who trust me to run their elections process to provide them with information. That's certainly what we've been trying to do," Ottawa County Clerk Justin Roebuck told WOOD-TV 8 during a Zoom interview Wednesday.
   
 "There's a lot of folks involved in this process that don't necessarily see the administrative side of elections and they don't understand all of the laws of the state of Michigan and how they apply," Roebuck added.
   
 "And certainly, there are some changes and some positive things, some tweaks that we need to make to the process, but it's important for people to understand the facts as well. So, to the best of my ability, I was trying to put that out there."
   
 One claim that's been repeatedly shared since the election is that workers at the TCF Center in Detroit, which acted as the city's absentee voter counting board, tabulated multiple ballots several times. Accusations have claimed anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand fake votes were tabulated for President-elect Joe Biden.
   
 "The canvass would definitely catch that and as we know from the canvass, there were some imbalances in many precincts across the state, Detroit not being an exception to that, but the imbalances were not significant," said Roebuck.
   
 "And again, these are things that are part of a process that election workers who are actually trained and certified to be election workers are trained to do."
   
 Those who volunteer to be observers or challengers are not given the same training as those tasked with physically tabulating ballots.
   
 "Some of the biggest claims that we've been dealing with are the manipulation of vote totals by the system that counts the votes and that really and truly -- because we use paper ballots in Michigan and literally almost every state in the country -- that can be proven whether or not machines manipulate votes," Roebuck explained, adding his elections team is about to start routine post-election audits.
   
 During the Wednesday hearing, President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said requesting a recount wouldn't do any good because he believes the paper ballots themselves were falsified.
   
 In Ottawa County and other counties in Michigan, the post-election audits specifically look for vulnerabilities.
   
 "I'm very confident that those vote totals will be accurate," Roebuck said about the audits scheduled in Ottawa County. "I really believe people deserve an accurate and transparent election process, but they also deserve honesty and I think we have to give people honest facts.
   
 "We have to get to the bottom of some of these issues and when false and misleading allegations are displayed, we need to confront those allegations and we need to give people honesty because people need to trust the process that they're using to select their government."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Anthony Davis is finalizing a five-year contract worth up to $190 million to return to the Los Angeles Lakers. Davis' agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, confirmed the terms of Davis' pending free agent deal to The Associated Press on Thursday. The Lakers didn't comment. One day after LeBron James agreed to a two-year, $85 million contract extension with the Lakers through 2022-23, Davis committed to the Lakers through the 2024-25 season. Davis' deal includes an early termination clause prior to the fifth year, but the contract is still a clear declaration that the 27-year-old Davis sees his long-term future with the 17-time NBA champions. The Lakers acquired Davis in a trade before last season, shipping most of their young core to New Orleans to acquire one of the best big men of his generation. With Klutch clients James and Davis at their core, the Lakers immediately built a championship contender around them. The 6-foot-10 Davis immediately clicked alongside James, earning his seventh straight All-Star selection. James and Davis reteamed in the bubble in central Florida and led the Lakers to Davis' first NBA title and James' fourth. The Lakers had missed the playoffs for six straight seasons before the veteran duo transformed the franchise into champions again. The Lakers are returning this month with a roster that looks even better than last season's championship squad. NBA veterans Marc Gasol and Montrezl Harrell have replaced Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee to keep Davis out of the center spot during the regular season, while Wesley Matthews replaced inconsistent Danny Green on the wing and gifted point guard Dennis Schröder arrived to take ball-handling pressure off James. Davis excelled throughout his first season with the Lakers,...

 # Vaccine rollout barrels on with health disparity in backseat
 Carla K. Johnson and Nicky Forster
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 Getting a COVID-19 vaccine to the right people could change the course of the pandemic in the United States. But who are the right people?
 As the decision looms for President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration, a new analysis argues for targeting the first vaccines to the same low-income Black, Hispanic and Native American households that have disproportionately suffered from the coronavirus. But no one at the federal level has committed to the idea, which would be a significant shift from the current population- based method adopted by Operation Warp Speed.
 “It’s not just a math problem. It’s a question of implementing a major social justice commitment,” said Harald Schmidt, a medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, who conducted the analysis of the strategies with colleagues from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston College.
 If the shots get to the right people, Schmidt argues, the benefits could extend to the entire nation: Fewer people would get sick, hospital capacity would improve and more of the economy could reopen. Lives would be saved.
 In October, a panel advising the federal government suggested setting aside 10% of the vaccine supply to distribute as an extra boost to the states with greater shares of disadvantaged groups. But the idea from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine has been largely ignored.
 Schmidt’s analysis finds the strategy could get vaccines to 12.3 million more vulnerable people in the early phases of distribution compared with the population-based method.
 Any distribution system will reverberate across the nation, with consequences for everyone. It will be shaped by the early steps of federal officials and by state leaders who will allocate vaccines in the months when there is not enough supply to go around. California and several other states have stated that they intend to direct some of their supply to disadvantaged neighborhoods, but there’s no national strategy to do so.
 No vaccine has been authorized for use yet in the U.S., but the preliminary results of ongoing clinical trials have been encouraging for Moderna’s and Pfizer’s candidates. If the Food and Drug Administration allows emergency use of one or both of those vaccines, there will be limited, rationed supplies before the end of the year.
 Operation Warp Speed officials announced last week that states would receive vaccine in proportion to their adult populations, at least for the first 6.4 million doses and possibly beyond.
 “We thought it best to keep it simple,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. “We thought that would be the fairest approach, the most consistent.”

 Schmidt worked with Parag Pathak, Tayfun Sonmez and M. Utku Unver, pioneers in devising how to distribute resources in high-stakes systems such as school choice and organ donation. The researchers shared their underlying data with The Associated Press. Their paper was posted online ahead of publication and has not been reviewed by other researchers.
 The analysis shows 15 states and Washington, D.C., have the largest shares of vulnerable, low-income minorities. These worse-off populations make up more than 25% of the states’ total populations. Those states stand to gain the most from a distribution method that sets aside a 10% national reserve.
 A federal set-aside is not the only way to get vaccine to vulnerable neighborhoods. In their vaccination plans, 18 states have said they will consider race and income as they map out vaccine distribution.
 Tennessee plans to reserve 10% of its vaccines for use in targeted areas with high scores on a measurement known as the social vulnerability index, which is based on census data that incorporates race, poverty, crowded housing and other factors. The index was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help identify communities that may need support in emergencies such as hurricanes.
 Vaccines will remain in limited supply for a time after Biden is sworn in, so rationing will continue into the spring.
 “I think it’s early to say what the Biden and Harris administration will ultimately do on that front,” said Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, associate dean for health equity research at Yale University’s medical school. She co-chairs Biden’s advisory board on the pandemic and has been a leading voice on reducing health disparities for the transition.
 Nunez-Smith said there are several data-based models to consider for distributing vaccines to communities hardest hit by the virus.
 “Thinking about equity has to be a top priority and cannot be an afterthought in the work,” she said.

I called another Walmart just to be sure.
 In the two weeks since its release, I’ve spent much more time than I’d like to admit camping out on websites for the opportunity to buy one of these $500 consoles, got my hopes up over unfounded rumors and spent a fair bit of time wondering whether I should just give into the scalpers to bring this whole thing to an end.
 This isn’t a review of the PlayStation 5. It’s a review of what it’s like to hunt for a PlayStation 5.
 Let me preface this by saying that I like the hunt for a hard-to-find gadget.
 Running around town to look for the latest gadget, game or thingamabob has been a long-running tradition for my brothers and I, going all the way back to looking for Pokémon cards, the PlayStation 3, “Guitar Hero,” “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” and several other long-forgotten gizmos.
 There was always a feeling that if we just looked hard enough, we would find what we were looking for. It was a treasure hunt with many hours spent in driving around in my parent’s tan minivan.
 The pandemic — and not to mention being in my 30s — has certainly put a damper on things. Checking every store just in case doesn’t seem all that responsible and I certainly don’t want to have to admit that I got covid looking for a video game console.
 It’s a consideration, too, for the stores that have pushed nearly all their console sales online, which introduces new and daunting competition: Bots that scoop up consoles faster than you can hit refresh.
 It’s here that I’ll say that console hunting has taken a serious step back since the mid-2000s.

I spent most of my time playing on browser using a Stadia controller, but it plays well with mouse and keyboard as well. WASD movement substitutes the left stick and instead of controlling your fireball after you shoot it, you have more input over the trajectory before firing. Using the cursor you can click a spot on the level and if you hold the mouse button down, you can then arc the shot in a new direction by dragging the arrow path. In the heat of combat using analog sticks is far more intuitive and quicker, but getting the hang of arcing with the mouse is really useful with practice.

In response to questions from election officials regarding technical errors on voters’ mail ballots that would lead to disqualification — like a missing signature or secrecy envelope — Boockvar’s deputy elections secretary on Nov. 2 told counties how they could notify voters of the issues and allow them to cast another ballot provisionally.
 Republicans said that guidance was “wholly inappropriate” and called for Boockvar to resign, arguing that because not all counties followed the same process, votes that were “cured” should be thrown out.
 But in reality, the Election Code is silent on curing ballots — only saying that ballots with missing signatures or secrecy envelopes should be voided. In multiple courts, judges either dismissed lawsuits that raised an issue with the process, or ruled county election boards could still count provisional ballots cast by voters who were alerted to mistakes.
 Sen. Lisa Boscola (D., Northampton), Act 77′s sponsor, said Boockvar wasn’t to blame for the legislature’s failure to address some of the questions raised before the election.

Vijay, I would. A couple comments. First off, on the attrition itself, it’s been very, very low in both organizations, and we monitored it. We monitored it in our own organization and within Wright throughout the process of sign and close, and we’re talking low single digits, like 1-2-3 employees, that’s it, which I think has to be tied somewhat to the pandemic. But again, if we think about these markets, we have market leading positions. People want to be part of this journey. They’re really excited about our culture, our portfolio, our incentives, and how we’re going to be specialized around those customers. We’ve been very thoughtful about that, very intentional about that, and we’re really pleased that the majority, if not all the employees are saying, we want to stay, especially customer-facing and the sales force and commercial facing.

 # Attorney General Nessel to Michigan Republicans on fraud claims: 'Put up or shut up'
 Craig Mauger
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 _Lansing_ — Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued blistering tweets Thursday, demanding that state Republicans "put up or shut up" when it comes to unproven claims of widespread election fraud.
 A day after a high-profile state House Oversight Committee hearing featuring Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Nessel, a Democrat, said Republicans had "embarrassed our state and defamed Michigan’s most populous city."
 She called on Laura Cox, chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, to renounce claims of corruption in Detroit or take "evidence" to Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, federal authorities or her own attorney general's office.
 "At long last, put up or shut up," tweeted Nessel, the state's top law enforcement officer.
 For weeks, supporters of Trump have asserted that there was widespread fraud in Michigan's Nov. 3 election, which the Republican incumbent lost to President-elect Joe Biden by 154,000 votes. However, Trump's backers have relied primarily on speculation and claims that have been rejected in court or by election officials.
 During a four-hour committee hearing in Lansing Wednesday, Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, labeled Michigan's election a "con job" and said Detroit was among the most corrupt cities in the country.
 He also browbeat legislators and urged them to intervene in the results of the election despite the fact that state law awards Michigan's 16 presidential electors to the certified winner of the popular vote. The Board of State Canvassers and bipartisan boards of canvassers in every county have already certified Michigan's results.
 "You are the final arbiter of how honest or not your election is in your state," Giuliani told lawmakers Wednesday night. "And it’s your responsibility to stand up to that.
 "All I can tell you is (if) we let them get away with this, I don’t know what happens after this.”
 Nessel said Republicans had allowed witnesses to make "baseless, debunked attacks on our elections." Multiple individuals who were presented by Giuliani on Wednesday night repeated claims about the TCF Center, where absentee ballots were counted in Detroit, that a Wayne County judge previously labeled "not credible."
 One individual, Mellissa Carone, who was a contractor for Dominion Voting Systems at the TCF Center, suggested there was 120% turnout in Detroit. Turnout in the city was 51%, according to official results.
 Carone claimed that she saw thousands of instances of ballots tabulated multiple times. If that occurred, Rep. Steven Johnson, R-Wayland, pressed Carone about why there weren't major differences between poll book totals, which track voters, and ballot count totals
 "What did you guys do, take it and do something crazy to it?” Carone then asked Johnson, referring to the Detroit poll books.
 The purpose of the meeting was to hear from people who witnessed things at TCF Center, where Detroit's absentee ballots were counted, said Rep. Matt Hall, R-Marshall, chairman of the House Oversight Committee.
 In a statement after the meeting, Hall said the testimony included "abuses of the duplicate ballot and ballot tabulating processes" and "Republican challengers being harassed" at TCF Center.
 "I want to stress that today was not about partisan politics, it was a piece of the puzzle as we try to figure out what happened and we will continue to gather more," Hall added.
 On Thursday, Nessel noted that Matthew Schneider, U.S. attorney for Michigan's Eastern District, is a Trump appointee and his jurisdiction includes Detroit and the TCF Center.
 "Wondering why @MIGOPChair doesn’t trust him to handle an investigation?" Nessel asked of Cox.
 On Tuesday, Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press that the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

Yes. And I guess, -- so maybe that's the next question, and this might be a little bit of a two-parter. But, you're already on this supply chain journey, right, ahead of COVID. We're seeing a lot of companies scramble quickly to react to COVID who weren't on that journey beforehand. You alluded to it a little bit in your prepared remarks about how to help other manufacturers accelerate their journey. You have solutions that you can sell into them. I don't know you might have certain relationships where you have such a tight partnership. You might be pushing some of these tools down into your kind of Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers that are selling product into you. Can you help us understand how you can get them up and running as fast to keep up with where your organization is today?

Well, you're right. We don't know. Right now, it's speculation. But, we do know that at some point, it will come back. So, what we've done -- we've actually done two things. I think, your remarks were spot on. The aerospace supply chains are traditionally relatively complex. They are usually very long. And the supply base of this is traditional. It's not like the most advanced and technologically kind of at the forefront supply base. So, we've done two things, a, we've broadened our supply base. That means we've really doubled down on creating supply alternatives. This is from a -- and it was born from a risk mitigation standpoint, since we didn't know if at some point, some suppliers would start to struggle or whatever was going to happen. So, we really doubled down on this one. And the other one was to emphasize our cycle times. So, we went through our manufacturing cycle times. And we found that we have opportunity to really shorten our cycle times.

"It’s really worrisome that Congress may not pass funding or that there’s information circulating saying that states don’t need additional funding," she said.

For instance, Mercer is now paying approximately $20 million a quarter on interest payments to service this debt. Now these payments will not be problem as long as Mercer can return to doing something like $50+ million per quarter in EBIT. As we stand however, with respect to expected muted earnings growth over the next few quarters, Mercer will have to execute well with respect to its working capital and/or asset sales to keep on generating enough cash to balance the books.
 So, what is the investment case for the dividend? Considering the condition of the financials, we do not see any growth coming in the payout for the time being as the company has invested the majority of its cash in recent times. Mercer's assets and sales remain much cheaper than the firm's 5-year averages, so the play here is a reversion to the mean with respect to the company's valuation. This stock from a historical basis bottoms every 3 to 4 years and we may just be getting one of these bottoms right now. Let's see how the fourth quarter plays out.

Nobody needs a study to tell them being a single parent is tough.      "This is a group of people who are kind of carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders, right?" said Dr. Natalie Stokes, a cardiology fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. "You're taking care of kids. You're trying to provide for your family."      Hoping to shed new light on the toll single parenthood takes on heart health, Stokes and her colleagues recently analyzed a federal health survey of 2,180 parents, which included 462 single parents, a quarter of whom were single men.      Researchers looked at seven heart health indicators - such as blood pressure, obesity, diet and whether the person smoked - and rated the parents on a 14-point scale. The single-parent group scored about half a point lower than the partnered parents. And single mothers scored almost a full point lower than mothers with partners.      The research, which is considered preliminary until published in a peer- reviewed journal, was presented last month at the American Heart Association's virtual Scientific Sessions conference.      Even after adjusting for age, race, existing medical conditions, poverty and more, the single-parent group was 1.31 times more likely to be rated as having below-ideal cardiovascular health.      While her study didn't pry into the reasons behind the discrepancy, Stokes hopes to explore that in future work.      The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the U.S. had 10.4 million single-parent households in 2019. Those numbers, and previous research, make single parenthood a potentially significant public health concern.      An international study in 2016 found that being a lone working mother predicted a higher risk of heart disease and stroke among women in the United States. In the early 2000s, researchers who tracked Swedish women for up to 20 years found that single mothers had greater odds of dying during the study period than women who had partners. And a Canadian study in 2016 found single fathers were three times more likely to die during the study's decade-long follow-up than single mothers or partnered fathers.      But Stokes emphasized her work should not be viewed as pointing to a problem caused by single parents. She'd rather focus on using it to make society more responsive to their needs.      Dr. Gina Lundberg, clinical director of the Emory Women's Heart Center in Atlanta, agreed.      "It takes a village to raise a kid, right? Well, your village is already really small if you're a single parent," Lundberg said. She was not involved in the new research but offered firsthand knowledge of life in a single-parent household.      "I think the study supports what we suspected all along: It's very stressful to be a single parent. Single parents have less time for their own health because there's no one to offload the sharing of responsibilities to. So, they tend to do more for their kids and neglect themselves.   "That's certainly what I witnessed," she said. "My father died when I was 14." Her mother raised her and her sister.      Before her father died, Lundberg remembers her mother making regular medical appointments. After his death, "I can't remember her going to the doctor at all. And I think there just wasn't time."      Lundberg, who also is an associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, had several ideas for how health care providers could be more accommodating.      "I think we've got to have some options to make things more flexible for these parents," she said.      Family care providers, for example, might offer appointments where parents and children could get their checkups at the same time. "Maybe on Saturday morning, when the kids aren't in school." And OB-GYNs could offer appointments for women to have bloodwork, blood pressure, breast and general physical exams done during a single visit.      Stokes said although her study's findings were just a starting point for understanding what single parents need, physicians could use the information as a prompt to consider their patients' life situation in deciding their care.      Doctors need to be allies with their patients in overcoming barriers to care, she said.      "The onus shouldn't be on the individuals," Stokes said. But patients can help by being open about their struggles, and by speaking up when necessary. "Maybe more aggressively early on saying … 'I was made aware that this might put me at increased risk. What types of things should I be doing?'"      Lundberg also said society needs to stop stigmatizing single parents.      They come from all kinds of income levels, education levels and ethnic backgrounds. It's mothers as well as fathers. And whether they started out as single parents or became one because of the death of a spouse, they deserve support, she said.      "I think we need to be doing more to realize they're stressed, it's affecting their health, and they need our help."

 WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a lower federal court to reexamine California restrictions on indoor religious services in areas hard hit by the coronavirus in light of the justices' recent ruling in favor of churches and synagogues in New York. The high court's unsigned order, with no noted dissent, leaves the California restrictions in place for now. But it throws out a federal district court ruling that rejected a challenge to the limits from Pasadena-based Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry, which has more than 160 churches across the state. Last week, the Supreme Court split 5-4 in holding that New York could not enforce certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogue

Her nomination failed on a 47-50 vote. Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Mass., and Susan Collins, R-Me., voted against Shelton.

The idea that synthetic oils are bad for older cars probably comes from the fact that early synthetic oils (we're talking 1970s) contained a chemical compound that could damage engine seals and, in some cases, cause leaks. These days, all types of motor oils are tested to make sure they won't damage your car's engine, and synthetics no longer use the chemical compound (ester) that caused these problems. If you won't take our word for it, look to the manufacturer. You should be able to find recommendations for oil in classic cars, and it's not uncommon for full synthetic to be the oil of choice. You can even look for a stamp of approval from your car's manufacturer on the back of the jug of oil, which will tell you that the company has tested that oil for compatibility with its engines.

Sure. As we step back and think about the market, first off it is becoming more competitive, but we look at that as an advantage. It really is pushing a comment that we use, called standard of care. Robotics for hip and knee arthroplasty is now becoming more and more a standard of care, which is valuable to Stryker as we are involved in all of these conversations with customers. So yes, we are seeing more from Johnson & Johnson, we are seeing more from Zimmer, and that talk track across various markets all over the world continues to bring robotics to the forefront and allows this thought process around standard of care.

If you need the ability to power something a bit bigger (like, say, a laptop or a full-sized refrigerator), the Jackery Explorer Power Station can handle it without breaking a sweat. With three AC outlets, two USB-C and two USB-A ports, and one DC car port, you have the ability to plug in and power just about anything you need, and you can also purchase separate 100W solar panels to create a true off-frid power supply. The 1000W model is the most powerful, but there are smaller sizes, too, all the way down to 160W depending on the level of backup you need.

On Slide 17, I want to give you an update on the upcoming LIBOR transition, which is in full swing for the market and for us at Goldman Sachs. Stephen, Brian and I have been very focused on the LIBOR transition, including recent announcements from global regulators providing significant clarity for the cessation of IBORs. Most IBOR currency tenor payer cessations are anticipated by year-end 2021. However, most tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR are expected to continue through June 2023. With that said, there are indications of a number of supervisory guidelines between year-end '21 and June 2023 that will limit production of new LIBOR-linked products.

A surge in cases in recent weeks led Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts to reissue some statewide restrictions, including requiring masks in certain businesses like salons and tattoo parlors. But Ricketts has refused to impose a statewide mask mandate, arguing that mandates breed resentment and may face resistance.

Robust features and commands also improve productivity. With the Anchor-Focus command, for example, you can dictate into a target document while referencing other files on your desktop or browser. And, the Nuance PowerMic III is especially helpful for dictation in call centers or locations with ambient noise. Voice-recognized commands do virtually anything a touch command will do, and more.

Outcasters is expectedly not a very demanding game. The bright, colorful aesthetic is quite easy on the eyes and other than the sometimes gratuitous particle effects that pepper the screen during tense moments, there isn't usually a whole lot going on. As a result, using Stadia Pro, Outcasters played very smoothly for me on all three platforms: Chromecast, browser, and mobile.
