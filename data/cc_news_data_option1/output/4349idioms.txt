After Piedmont won game one in the best-of-three series on Thursday, the teams ventured to Dublin once more on Saturday. Briarwood took early control of game two of the series, leading 5-1 after the top of the third inning.
 The Lady Cougars, however, would score three runs in the bottom of the third, fourth and fifth innings. Briarwood was unable to push any additional runs across home plate and Piedmont was able to celebrate winning the state championship trophy.
 Emily McEwen helped pace the Lady Cougars at the plate in the series-clinching game, driving in four runs. Maddie Waddleton also had two RBI while Haley Ann Frank collected two hits including a triple and an RBI. Marissa Holder drew two walks.

When you ran out of fresh bell peppers, you still had a can of pineapple.
