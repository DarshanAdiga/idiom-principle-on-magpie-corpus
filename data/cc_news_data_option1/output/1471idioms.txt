Stephan El Shaarawy marked his Roma debut in style as Luciano Spalletti enjoyed the first win of his second spell in charge with a 3-1 victory over Frosinone.
 A prone Radja Nainggolan put the hosts ahead in after 18 minutes with an opportunistic strike but Daniel Ciofani hauled Frosinone level six minutes later.
 El Shaarawy, who completed a long-anticipated loan switch from AC Milan earlier this week on the back of a fruitless temporary stint at Monaco, made his debut alongside fellow new recruit Ervin Zukanovic and took centre stage three minutes after half-time.
 Zukanovic was the provider with a cross from the left and El Shaarawy pivoted to send a stunning backheel volley beyond visiting goalkeeper Nicola Leali.
 There was a stylish third six minutes from time as the returning Francesco Totti came off the bench to play in Miralem Pjanic for an assured finish.
 Roma lie fifth, three points behind fourth-placed Inter who take on rivals Milan on Sunday.
 Frosinone remain second bottom and Carpi edged a point further ahead of them in 18th thanks to a 1-1 draw at home to Palermo.
 Veteran forward Alberto Gilardino put the away side in front but Carpi substitute Matteo Mancosu won and converted a 74th-minute penalty.
 Sassuolo are level on points with Milan in seventh having claimed the same scoreline away at Atalanta, German Denis scoring on his farewell appearance for the home side to quickly cancel out Domenico Berardi's 27th-minute opener - firing home the rebound after Andrea Consigli saved his initial penalty.

Dear Dave,   I own a small company, and we lease the building we operate from. As an entrepreneur, how do you know when it is time to stop leasing and buy a place of your own?   Peter
 Dear Peter,   You should only buy a building when you have a solid track record of success, and a really good idea of what your building needs will be. A growing business is always a good thing, but you don't want to focus too much on real estate and not enough on generating revenue and managing that growth intelligently. You would also want to make sure you're going to be in anything you buy for a good, long while.
 I'm a big fan of leasing the first few years after starting your own business. It's even better if you can work out of your home, but I understand that's not always practical. Down the road, you can choose to lease with an option to buy, or, in the right situation, just buy a building.
 Remember, make sure you do it all with cash. Don't add debt to the equation!   Dave
 Is it ever too late?   Dear Dave,   Life insurance is one of those things I always said I would get around to buying someday, but, for various reasons, I just haven't done it yet. Is there ever a time when it is too late to get life insurance?   Angie
 Dear Angie,   First of all, I only recommend level term life insurance. It's fairly easy to get until around age 70, depending on your overall health situation. Once you get into your seventies and beyond, however, it can be more difficult to find reasonably priced coverage.
 I recommend that most people have 10 to 12 times their annual income in term life insurance. To be honest, though, you really shouldn't need life insurance if you're 70 or older. At that point, if you've saved and invested wisely over the years, you can be self-insured. By this, I mean you've got enough money in savings and investments to cover funeral expenses - plus enough for a spouse to live on comfortably after you're gone.
 Don't wait any longer, Angie. Take care of this today!   Dave

The whole country is on an anxious edge. We’re dealing with a deadly virus, one we have no history with and no immunity from yet. There’s no vaccine. Tests are still spotty. It has killed more than 22,000 Americans to date and infected hundreds of thousands more. And it came from a hostile China that lied, directly resulting in all the chaos we’re dealing with. And our elites have shipped untold numbers of jobs to China over the past few decades, leaving us more vulnerable to them than we should be.
 The viral chaos has also killed millions of jobs and plunged everything from our retirement savings to our toiletry needs into serious doubt. When you find toilet paper at the grocery store now you feel like you’re Indiana Jones discovering the lost ark. There are possible meat and other food shortages on the horizon. And there’s no end in sight yet. Some officials are talking about opening things up, but that’s all they’re doing so far. Talking. Meanwhile we’re still locked up in our homes, and millions worry if they’ll even be able to keep their homes and looking ahead, how we’ll feed our families. The sheer scale of the problems we face was unthinkable a few weeks ago and seemingly inescapable now.
 Into this crisis has stepped not a generation of serious and sober leaders rising to the moment, but a whole bunch of opportunists who are happily flying their tinpot tyrant flag. And it needs to stop, right now. It’s making a really bad, no good and quite terrible situation even worse. Too many of our elected and unelected officials are acting like toddlers testing their boundaries.
 There are the police officers who thought it was a good idea to pester a little girl shooting baskets alone in a park. She was socially distanced. She was fine. If a game of street 3-on-3 suddenly broke out, well, that’s a different story. But she was alone. So leave her alone. The police later apologized, but they should have just used some common sense and avoided the whole situation. And there are the police officers in Colorado who arrested a dad playing ball with his daughter in a park. Leave people alone or this could start getting ugly. Most Americans support the police, but we don’t support a police state.
 There are the officials who decided Easter weekend was a good opportunity to start messing with churches struggling like everyone else to deal with the new reality. California’s Mendocino County is banning church singing on a livestream. How does this help stop the spread of coronavirus? Kentucky’s Democrat governor took to taking down Christians’ license plates for going to church in their cars. How does this help halt the virus from spreading? It doesn’t. It just makes people who are already on edge that much edgier. Elections matter. Remember this in a few years and do better.
 Michigan should also do better. It elected the cluelessly tyrannical Gretchen Whitmire as its governor. A few weeks ago Whitmire was a rising Democrat star. Now, she’s a petty thug who’s in over her head (which doesn’t rule her out of still being a rising Democrat star). She’s awful. She has gone on a power trip worthy of Blofeld, the nutty Bond villain who built a fortress in a volcano and fed his underlings to piranhas. Whitmire is telling people who own more than one home that they cannot drive between those homes. How does this stop the spread of the virus? She’s telling people they can’t buy carpet and paint because they’re not “essential.” Tell that to anyone who suddenly has to repair something in the home they’re suddenly hanging onto because they suddenly lost their job because Whitmire arbitrarily closed their business. Tell that to the guy whose whole job is home repair and remodeling. Who is she or any of these so-called leaders to say what is and isn’t “essential”? Broadly speaking, a legal job that enables someone to feed their family is essential to that family. Tell them they’re not essential and they’ll tell you exactly what they think of you. There will be choice words and gestures.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Three potential COVID-19 vaccines are making fast progress in early-stage testing in volunteers in China and the U.S., but it's still a long road to prove if they'll really work.
 China's CanSino Biologics is beginning the second phase of testing its vaccine candidate, China's Ministry of Science and Technology said Tuesday.
 In the U.S., a shot made by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc. isn't far behind. The first person to receive that experimental vaccine last month returned to a Seattle clinic Tuesday for a second dose.
 NIH infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci told The Associated Press there are "no red flags" so far and he hoped the next, larger phase of testing could begin around June.
 A third candidate, from Inovio Pharmaceuticals, began giving experimental shots for first-step safety testing last week in the U.S. and hopes to expand its studies to China.
 Initial tests focus on safety, and researchers in both countries are trying out different doses of different types of shots.
 But moving into the second phase is a critical step that allows vaccines to be tested in many more people to look for signs that they protect against infection.
 Last week, CanSino filed a report showing it aimed to enroll 500 people in this next study, comparing two doses of the vaccine to dummy shots.
 Looking ahead, Fauci said if the new coronavirus continues to circulate widely enough over the summer and fall, it might be possible to finish larger studies slightly sooner than the 12 to 18 months he'd originally predicted — maybe toward "mid to late winter of next season."
 "Please let me say this caveat: That is assuming that it's effective. See, that's the big 'if,'" Fauci stressed. "It's got to be effective and it's got to be safe."
 During a news conference in China, authorities also cautioned that the studies must be done properly.
 "Although we are in an emergency, we cannot lower the standards of safety and effectiveness in the reviews of vaccines," said Wang Junzhi, a Chinese biopharmaceutical expert. "The public is paying huge attention."
 The World Health Organization this week counted more than five dozen other vaccine candidates in earlier stages of development being pursued around the world. Many research groups are teaming up to speed the work; in an announcement Tuesday, vaccine giants Sanofi and GSK became the latest to partner on a candidate.
 On the WHO's list are a wide variety of ways to make vaccines -- so if one approach doesn't pan out, hopefully another one will.
 CanSino's vaccine is based on a genetically engineered shot it created to guard against Ebola. The leading U.S. candidates use a different approach, made from copies of a piece of the coronavirus' genetic code.

E proprio la sua ammirazione per il Milan potrebbe essere un elemento a favore della dirigenza per mettere le mani sul playmaker delle rondinelle, ma la trattativa sara complicatissima sostanzialmente per due motivi. Il primo riguarda il prezzo. Il presidente Cellino chiede oltre 40 milioni di euro e solo l'inserimento di una contropartita tecnica, oltre che alla cessione di un giocatore potrebbe dare al Milan la liquidita giusta per investire su Tonali. Quindi andranno osservate con particolare attenzione le situazioni di Gigio Donnarumma (in scadenza contrattuale) e Lucas Paqueta. Il secondo ostacolo e la concorrenza spietata in Italia e all'estero. La Juve da questo punto di vista ha piu chance perche offrirebbe un progetto tecnico vincente da subito a Tonali, a ruota Inter, Napoli, Roma e societa straniere. Il Milan dovrebbe fare uno sforzo notevole per battere queste societa, che francamente sembrano in vantaggio per una questione di progettualita. Ma ritorniamo al concetto iniziale, il Milan per dare un segnale alla piazza e per ripartire dai giocatori giusti dovrebbe cercare in ogni modo di prendere Tonali. Con lui il centrocampo sarebbe a posto per dieci anni, insieme a Bennacer che potrebbe giocare ottimamente da mezzala.

PEORIA -- Rick LeHew has watched as golf has become the epicenter in central Illinois for a raging exhibit of inconsistency in the application of the governor's shelter-in-place orders related to COVID-19.
   
 "This is a state-wide mandate, but it seems like it's evolved into a county- by-county interpretation," said LeHew, who is senior director for field operations for the Chicago District Golf Association and essentially has all the downstate courses in his jurisdiction.
   
 It burst into the forefront -- pun intended -- when Pekin Country Club, noting it was a private property, accommodated golfers.
   
 The Tazewell County Sheriffs's office believed it did not have the authority to shut the course down. The Illinois State Police did not agree.
   
 Game on.
   
 State Police issued a cease-and-desist order to the country club and said it will work with local law enforcement branches -- that likely means primarily the Tazewell County Sheriff's office -- to enforce it.
   
 Cleve In The Eve thinks the whole issue is an over-reach with constitutional implications, as government tries to apply a one-size-fits-all edict to a sport that, by its very nature, affords distance.
   
 Walk into a giant chain store or a grocery store these days, and you risk true exposure to COVID-19. Walk a golf course alone, or with a partner, and your odds are pretty good you'll stay healthy.
   
 Albeit there are always those who, no matter how relaxed guidelines are, will botch it for the entire herd.
   
 But there are bigger issues here.
   
 Pekin Country Club member Michael McCafferty pointed out one of those in an email exchange with the state, obtained by WMBD.
   
 "I have to wonder when we stopped functioning as a free society and where you were given the authority to take away my constitutional rights," wrote McCafferty, who does have an ownership piece in Pekin Country Club.
   
 LeHew, an longtime elite golfer in central Illinois, has some other issues covered for us.
   
 "The Pekin Country Club declared itself private, and remained open for golf and that was deemed OK," LeHew said. "Now it's closed. We need some consistency. We need someone from the governor's office to step up and make a ruling that settles this debate and is fair."
   
 And public courses and private courses should not, says LeHew, have different privileges.
   
 "I don't like that," LeHew said. "Places like Weaver Ridge and Pekin Country Club are private. Public courses are closed. That's not right. It's not fair.
   
 "Walmart is full and you can go in there, but golf courses are not safe? I understand what's at stake with COVID-19. I understand the essential businesses concept."
   
 But he also understands that the calendar is approaching May, and as we move toward warmer weather (well, maybe not on Tuesday), people are going to get itchy to be outdoors.
   
 People were spotted golfing at Mount Hawley Country Club just a few days ago.
   
 "Two weeks ago, people were walking onto Peoria Park District Golf Courses because there was nobody working there, the park had ordered its employees to work from home," LeHew said. "Since then, the park has put up barricades to its parking lots in an effort to stop a few more people."
   
 LeHew has a plan he'd like the state to consider toward re-opening all courses:
   
 • Pro shops and restaurants must be closed.
   
 • Tee times booked online, at least 15 minutes apart.
   
 • Maximum play is twosomes. "Foursomes, you have guys standing around at the tee and on the putting green, too close to each other," LeHew said.
   
 • No carts at all. You have to walk the course.
   
 • Pull all the flags and raise the cups. "Golfers know when a putt is good," LeHew said. "Raise the cups, and you don't have people reaching down in there."
   
 • No rakes in the bunkers.
   
 "The idea is to eliminate all touches," LeHew said. "Golf courses are not equipped to issue carts to every person and limit them to one person per cart. And you'd have to clean the cart each time it's used. No touches. So you eliminate it."
   
 LeHew has a putting green in his yard. He's a guy who by now would have completed 10 rounds of golf and 10 more outings each to the range and the putting green.
   
 Instead, he has golfed twice since Halloween. And that was in North Carolina.
   
 "Put the proper guidelines in place and they will work," LeHew said. "Half the people will be eliminated by the no-carts rule. Yes, there will room for fewer people to play.
   
 "But at least someone gets to play golf."

Napoli coach Mauricio Sarri believes Gonzalo Higuain is becoming the best striker in the world and would not swap him for Bayern Munich star Robert Lewandowski.
 Higuain has been persistently linked with a move to Bayern Munich despite Lewandowski's strong goalscoring record at the Allianz Arena.
 The Poland international, who took his Bundesliga tally for the season to 17 with a double in the 2-1 win over Hamburg on Friday, admitted this week he was unsure why such rumours had surfaced given his form.
 But Sarri stoked the reports by suggesting the Argentina striker is the better of the pair after he scored his 21st Serie A goal in as many appearances in the 4-2 win over Sampdoria on Sunday.
 "Higuain is becoming what I always thought he should be – in other words, the best striker in Europe and perhaps the world," the Napoli coach told Mediaset Premium.
 "Higuain is like a dog, devouring any chance he gets. I would not exchange him for anyone, not even Lewandowski."
 Sarri received a two-game Coppa Italia ban following a heated row with Roberto Mancini in the closing stages of their 2-0 defeat to Inter.
 On Sunday, he donned a scarf belonging to the Inter boss which was given to him by television show Le Iene in homage to his colleague.
 "There's no point looking at the table now as there's a long way to go. We are happy with what we are doing. Of course, this week remains bitter because of the error I made in the Coppa Italia," he said.
 "Today I wore Mancini's scarf because it was a promise I made to Le Iene [TV show] and I was happy to keep it. This was my gesture of peace."

Milley: Truman Strike Group Will Stay at Sea Until Carrier Nimitz Ready to Deploy - USNI News

BERKELEY Calif. (AP) — The Northern California victims of catastrophic wildfires caused by Pacific Gas & Electric's decaying electrical grid will have at least $19 million siphoned way from a $13.5 billion fund for their losses to cover administrative costs.
 A bankruptcy judge said he would approve drawing from the victims' fund as part of a plan reviewed Tuesday during a court hearing. The decision came after PG&E and a committee representing the victims struck an accord on a $21.8 million budget for administering the $13.5 billion fund for the thousands of people who lost loved ones, homes and businesses during a series of deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
 PG&E will pay an additional $2.5 million to cover the fund's administrative fees, but the rest of the money will come from the fund earmarked for the fire victims under the plan that won U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali's blessing.
 Even more money could be diverted from the fire victims' fund to cover its administrative costs if PG&E's plan for getting out of bankruptcy gains court approval by June 30, but misses its Aug. 29 target date for becoming effective.
 The economic upheaval triggered by the coronavirus pandemic has increased the chances that it may take longer for PG&E to raise the tens of billions of dollars that will be needed to finance its proposed bankruptcy plan than the company envisioned earlier this year.
 The uncertainty prompted the company to draw up a contingency plan that calls for the plan becoming effective Dec. 30, which would result in the fire victims having to wait until next year before the $13.5 billion fund starts to pay their claims.

 CALGARY—A cattle-industry group says measures that helped ranchers weather the BSE crisis in the early 2000s should be brought back immediately as the COVID-19 pandemic slows down work at packing plants.
 The Canadian Cattlemen's Association is calling for a federally co-ordinated program that would enable producers to keep their animals longer by feeding them a maintenance, rather than a growth, diet.
 It says it could follow a model similar to one developed in 2004 after the discovery of BSE, or mad cow disease, in Canada forced borders to close to Canadian beef exports.
 The cattlemen's group says capacity has been reduced at a number of beef processors across North America in the last week because of measures meant to protect workers from the spread of COVID-19.
 That includes the Cargill Meat Solutions plant south of Calgary, which represents more than one-third of Canada's beef-processing capacity and which announced this week it is idling its second shift.
 United Food and Commercial Workers Local 401 says there have been 38 cases of COVID-19 at the plant in High River and the union has called for a two-week closure with guaranteed full compensation for 2,000 workers.
 \"We learned many lessons during the hard years of BSE, and it is time to implement the policies that previously helped us weather the storm,\" said Bob Lowe, president of the cattlemen's group.

(AP) - The Treasury Department said Tuesday that the nation's major airlines have tentatively agreed to terms for $25 billion in federal aid to pay workers and keep them employed through September.The assistance will include a mix of cash and loans, with the government getting warrants that can be converted into small ownership stakes in the leading airlines.The airlines did not want to give up equity, but Treasury demanded compensation for taxpayers. The airlines have little leverage — their business has collapsed as the COVID-19 pandemic reduces air travel to a trickle and they face mass layoffs without the federal aid.The nation's six biggest airlines — Delta, American, United, Southwest, Alaska and JetBlue — along with four smaller carriers have reached agreements in principle, and the Treasury Department said talks were continuing with others. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the department would work with the airlines to finalize deals "and disburse funds as quickly as possible.”President Donald Trump — perhaps mindful of criticism that the government was bailing out a previously profitable industry — said the deals will support airline workers and protect taxpayers.“Our airlines are now in good shape, and they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them,” Trump said.The payroll aid is roughly based on each airline’s spending on wages and benefits from April through September 2019,American Airlines said Treasury approved $5.8 billion for the airline, a $4.1 billion grant and a $1.7 billion low-interest loan. CEO Doug Parker called it “fantastic news,” and “we now believe we have the financial resources necessary to help us withstand this crisis.”Analysts expected United and Delta were also eligible for more than $5 billion. United said it expected to complete a final deal with Treasury “in the next few days,” but gave no figures. Delta did not comment immediately.Southwest Airlines said it expects to get $3.2 billion, including more than $2.3 billion in cash and the balance in an unsecured loan.The airlines had expected to begin receiving the aid — entirely in cash that didn't have to be repaid — from the government to cover their payrolls by April 6, the deadline set by Congress. Instead, they found themselves locked in several days of tense negotiations with the Treasury Department, which insisted that only 70% of the aid should be in cash, with the rest in loans that airlines must repay.In addition, Treasury demanded that to compensate taxpayers, the largest airlines must turn over warrants that, if exercised, could give the government ownership stakes ranging between 1% and 3%, according to calculations by a Raymond James analyst. Southwest said Treasury will get about 2.6 million warrants, or less than 1% of its outstanding stock. Others gave no details.The warrants total 10% of the loan amount, and Mnuchin can exercise them at each airline's closing stock price on April 9, according to airline officials.The nation's airlines entered 2020 riding a decade-long hot streak in which together they earned tens of billions of dollars due to strong travel demand. That success came crashing down in just a few weeks, as governments restricted travel to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, and people feared contracting the illness on a plane.As part of a $2.2 trillion economic-relief package, Congress also approved a separate $25 billion program to provide loans to airlines. Analysts expect less interest because the airlines can tap private credit markets, but American said it plans to seek a $4.75 billion government loan, and Alaska Airlines indicated it too will apply under the separate program.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

AC Milan coach Sinisa Mihajlovic believes his team still have a chance of winning Serie A this season despite trailing leaders Napoli by 12 points.
 An impressive 2-0 home win over Fiorentina last Sunday moved the San Siro side up to sixth and they have only lost two of their last 13 league matches.
 Milan are still eight points adrift of Inter in the third Champions league spot, but Mihajlovic is not ruling out an even higher target of Scudetto glory after his team's recent upturn in fortunes.
 Ahead of a key away game at eighth-placed Empoli – who have only lost one of their last eight league matches – on Saturday, the ex-Sampdoria boss insisted the title was still up for grabs.
 "The championship is still open," said Mihajlovic. "If we play like we did against Fiorentina we stand a good chance.
 "I would like to see more continuity in my team. We have the right characteristics and I saw them after Fiorentina. Against Fiorentina it took generosity, cynicism, attitude, desire to win.
 "These are all things that depend on us. We can win if we show them. We have to put together so many positive things to give consistency to our results.
 "The team is growing. In respect of the past four years, after 20 games we have the most points of any Milan, but the fact we could have had more points makes me angry."
 Mihajlovic's future has been the subject of significant speculation throughout this season, but the 46-year-old has not allowed that to bother him.
 He added: "My future? I never doubted my stay here – I have a contract and a clear conscience.
 "I work hard and always keep going. I can only worry about my team and the next match, then what will happen will happen."

That’s contrary to the city’s view that the property owner has on multiple occasions requested the help of the city to evict trespassers.
 Lovings is also under the impression that the city, in coordination with “the government” has access to $500 million to help the homeless.
 “Does this look like $500 million to you?” he asks in disgust, surveying the dirt field lined with makeshift shelters among the treeline.
 He attended Banning High School and graduated just a couple years or so ahead of City Councilwoman Colleen Wallace, whose district the homeless encampment sits in.
 Wallace has been out there with humanitarian Juanita Diaz to hand out food and supplies to those staying there.
 According to Lovings, the city had previously told homeless people not to be in that same field.
 Lovings, who is prone to seizures, says that his family dealt with a deadbeat landlord who did nothing when their floor allegedly caved in, and they were evicted due to safety reasons, and lost a court battle to be allowed back in, claiming they ended up being charged for trespassing.
 The “blue building” was a safe space for him and his friends, Lovings claims.
 “Inside we could be warm and healthy. They give us no reason at all and put us out in the cold.”
 Steven Douglas, a retired sheriff who was once president of the nonprofit Faith In Action, used to work with that organization to provide assistance to the homeless.
 He does not agree that moving the homeless and confining them to a stretch of city-owned open space by the Banning Justice Center is the wisest way to help them.
 “I understand the problem. I’m not a heartless guy,” he says.
 But, in his observations, he insists that “the majority of homeless in town want to sit around and do their drugs and expect the rest of us to alter our lifestyles to accommodate them, and that’s wrong,” he insists.
 In his opinion, the city has “the right” to commandeer hotels suffering from low occupancy due to the quarantine orders and fill them with homeless folks until it all blows over, though the city disagrees.
 According Schulze, the owner of the commercial building at 553 W. Ramsey St., which the owner has been trying to sell, harbored nearly 30 homeless individuals, and had asked for the city’s help in getting them removed.
 “The city is aware of roughly 60 homeless who live in our community. Most of those individuals have ties to the city,” Schulze says, though “Occasionally we get someone who is new, like an inmate who is released from the county jail with nowhere to go.”
 Faith In Action helped provide some of the tents that have been distributed, Schulze says.
 “It’s not an ideal situation,” he admits, and it is temporary until the city can come up with a longer-term solution as to what to do with everyone who has been invited to stay there.
 Todd Pikop, 63, another Banning High School alumnus, has been homeless “off and on for about nine years.”
 He had been taking care of his mother at a house along a golf course in Hemet; when she passed away, “I couldn’t find a job fast enough,” and could not prove that he had a right to be at the house. His relatives fought him for it, he claims, and charged him with breaking and entering and trespassing.
 “All my tools, everything I owned was in that house, and it was all taken from me,” he says. He ended up in jail, and his relatives sold everything he owned, he says.
 “My father had just passed away, and my ex-wife and relatives just kept taking things away from me, and I didn’t know how to stop it,” Pikop says. So he returned to his roots.
 He says “the police” issued him the green tent he has been using.
 “It’s just been rough. We were fine in that lady’s building, but that seemed to be a problem,” Pikop says. “Out here it gets cold and wet at night.”
 Valentino Lopez, 48, claims to have been a former fabricator, forklift operator and rap artist. He has been homeless for about five years. Originally from Highland, he had been housesitting for a home in Banning, he says, before being fired and ended up homeless.
 His adult children do not keep in touch with him, he says. “I think I may be a grandfather,” but he has no real way to know.
 “Three years ago we were in the next field over,” Lopez says. “I used to use trash to build shelters, and burned some at night to keep warm, but the working class neighbors in the apartments across the way thought it was an eyesore. The city doesn’t have shelter programs, and every day it’s something different: you can’t be here, you can’t be there.”
 He says he is thankful for the assistance and food provided by organizations like Set Free Church.
 “We don’t want to be here, but it’s necessary to be here, so we’re not sitting in someone’s garage,” Lopez says.
 The move had nothing to do with the quarantine orders from the county and state, though city manager Schulze points out “Having 30 people in an unsanitary building is an incubator to spread disease.”
 He says that the city is working with the county’s Economic Development Agency to fund up to five trailers to temporarily move some homeless individuals into, at a yet-to-be-determined location.
 Abel Barajas has dropped by, as have so many others, to drop off clothes that formerly belonged to his children, emulating his aunt Juanita Diaz, who is out at the field regularly to provide what she can to help.
 “These were just sitting in a garage. I’m sure there are people out here who needed them more,” he says.
 Diaz explains her role as a caretaker for anyone who needs help, whether it is family members and their children who need a stable place to be, or providing food to the homeless, it is simply the right thing to do.
 “We’re not going to be able to please everyone” by accommodating the homeless and others in less fortunate circumstances, and inconveniencing those who disagree that the city should allow squatters to stay on city property, but “If no one wants to help, that’s on them,” Diaz says. “When it’s my time to stand before our Father in Heaven, He will know what I did. And, it makes me feel good.”
 “I know what it’s like to struggle. I was a single mom and barely had enough. I made sure my kids never suffered as a result of that, and I want the people out here to know that someone does care about them.”
 Councilwoman Wallace, representing District 5, feels compelled to do what she can personally.
 “I’m helping my people,” pure and simple she explains. “I know a lot of them, or I knew them when they were little, or knew their parents. Some of them are not in their right mind, but my heart still goes out to them.”
 While she and Diaz were out one day handing out bags of food, Wallace noted “Just as many people who drove by offering to help, passed by with judgmental looks.”
 To those in the field, “They’re people too. That could be you out there. I’m not worried about the backlash” of helping. “These are residents in my community, and I want to help them.”

Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri has been given a two-game Coppa Italia suspension and a €20,000 fine for comments made to Inter counterpart Roberto Mancini during their quarter-final meeting on Tuesday.
 Mancini and Sarri clashed on the touchline in the closing stages of their encounter at the San Paolo after goals from Stevan Jovetic and Adem Ljajic sent Inter into the last four with a 2-0 win.
 The Inter coach alleged after the game that Sarri had directed Italian homophobic slurs "frocio" and "finocchio" towards him - describing the Napoli boss as "shameful" and "a racist".
 Sarri, however, claimed he could not remember what he had said and claimed Mancini's accusations were over the top.
 On Thursday, Lega Serie A declared its disciplinary decision to sanction the 57-year-old with a two-game ban and fine for "directing extremely insulting epithets at the coach of the opposing team".
 Mancini also received a €5,000 fine for "leaving the technical area and taking an intimidating attitude toward the coach of the opposing team, who had insulted him" and being "disrespectful" to the fourth official after the game.
 Sarri will serve his suspension from next season following Napoli's elimination from the competition.

A 5-1 thrashing of Frosinone helped Napoli reach the Serie A summit at the season's halfway stage after Inter suffered a last-gasp defeat to Sassuolo.
 Being crowned 'winter champions' may hold significance for the San Paolo side, who were also top of the pile at the same stage when they last won the Scudetto in 1990.
 Andrea Consigli's heroic performance in goal for Sassuolo and a last-gasp Domenico Berardi penalty at San Siro put Roberto Mancini's Inter under threat in top spot, and Napoli capitalised in ruthless fashion.
 Maurizio Sarri's men dominated from the start at the Stadio Comunale Matusa and deservedly went a goal up after 20 minutes, as Raul Albiol found the net from close range following Jorginho's corner.
 Gonzalo Higuain scored from the penalty spot on the half-hour and took his tally for the season to 18 just a minute after Marek Hamsik had put Napoli three goals to the good in the second half.
 Manolo Gabbiadini replaced Higuain and got in on the act himself with the visitors' fifth and Paolo Sammarco netted a consolation goal late on.
 Genoa recorded an important 2-0 away win over Atalanta following late goals from Blerim Dzemaili and Leonardo Pavelotti, while a single Franco Vazquez strike saw Palermo defeat Verona at the Bentegodi.
 Bologna were beaten 1-0 at home by Chievo, with Simone Pepe scoring the winner in the 79th minute after Mattia Destro had previously missed a penalty for the hosts.
 Finally, veteran striker Massimo Maccarone scored his eighth goal of the season to help Empoli ease past Torino.
