New Delhi [India], May 28 (ANI): As romantic flick 'Hum Tum' clocked in 16 years on Thursday, actor Rani Mukerji remembered shooting the film with legendary actor Rishi Kapoor who recently passed away, leaving a void in the Indian cinema industry.   "Hum Tum will always be memorable for me because it was the film that Chintu uncle was part of and I fondly remember our shoot in Amsterdam," she said.   "Recently, when I met up with him before his untimely demise, we were chatting about the Hum Tum shoot and we were recalling the days of how much fun we had during the Amsterdam schedule!" the 'Mardaani' actor added.   Recalling the shoot of the film, Mukerji pointed out that it was one of the very first films in which Kapoor started portraying character roles.   "I remember very clearly that for Chintu uncle, it was one of the first films in which he had started playing key character roles," she said.   "He took a leap of faith and he agreed to play Saif's dad because till then he was always the leading star. Somehow he did this and he was just brilliant as usual and made our film truly special!" he added.   Rani also revealed that she was a huge fan of Rishi Kapoor, the actor and the person that he was. "Chintu uncle belonged to the era where actors never did sync sound and Hum Tum was a sync-sound film. We were shooting in a house in Amsterdam which had wooden flooring and Dilip Subramaniam was the sound recordist," the 'Chalte Chalte' actor said.   "He kept telling Chintu uncle that each time he would take a step in the house, the floor would creak and the sound would come. Chintu uncle invariably moved and Dilip would say cut, we will need one more!" she added.   The actor further believes that 'Hum Tum' was definitely ahead of the curve by showing progressive portrayal of women in cinema. "It was definitely ahead of its time. The way my character Rhea reacts at the end and walks away from Saif's character's (Karan) life when he just randomly suggests to get married because they had physical intimacy, it was bold," she said.   "I think that was way ahead of its time for a woman to do this in a Hindi film. For a girl to actually walk away from a man and break stereotypes and notions of how a woman should react, it was new but it was also much needed to show in cinema," she further said.   Helmed by Kunal Kohli 'Hum Tum' narrates the story of a boy and girl who initially hate each other but eventually ended up falling in love as destiny keeps uniting them at different stages of life. Actor Saif Ali Khan stars opposite Rani in the film. (ANI)

New Delhi [India], May 28 (ANI): Naresh Kumar, Senior Scientist, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday predicted that there would be a slight decrease in heat intensity from Thursday in the northern and central part of India. He further stated that this will be due to a western disturbance (WD) affecting the Himalayan region.   "Heat intensity is likely to decrease from today as a western disturbance is likely to bring light rainfall over the western Himalayan region," he said while speaking to ANI.   Kumar also predicted that winds moving from the Bay of Bengal would cause rainfall in north-west and central India.   "Moreover, winds coming from Bay of Bengal will also result in spells of rainfall in north-west and central India," he said.   The India Meteorological Department on Thursday said that under the influence of the WD and an east-west trough in lower levels and likely occurrence of rain-thunderstorm from 28-30 May, maximum temperatures over plains of north India are likely to recede from May 28 onwards with a substantial reduction of heatwave conditions from May 29.

“I was very stubborn and very hard-headed,” Shaw added. “There were days when Tapp thought he was right and I thought I was right and we butted heads and he usually won.”
 Shaw left as the second-winningest player in Bearcat history, a mark since broken by Tyler Dougherty and Ryan Welty, two of this year’s seniors.
 In 2004, Shaw made a last-second 3-pointer in a regional championship to advance to the Elite Eight round of the NCAA Division II basketball tournament.
 Shaw remembered he missed every other 3-point attempt, but was ecstatic to win the game.
 “It was a neat moment in that Kelvin Parker was such an unselfish player and he wasn’t going to force a bad shot. He found Jesse in the corner,” Tappmeyer said.
 Shaw said, “I let it go and the buzzer sounded while I was in mid-air, went through the net. I was getting tackled and you know, the rest is history.”
 Although Shaw’s set to coach another Maryville, the ties to Maryville, Missouri remain tight as ever.
 “Obviously look at what Ben’s done. We’ve taken a lot of the things that we learned from Coach Tapp there from our four years together and we’ve used them ever since,” Shaw said of his former teammate and current head coach Ben McCollum. “That background that he gave us is priceless.”
 As Shaw and Tappmeyer are now set to coach the Maryville basketball program, they’ll never forget their roots.
 “Jesse and I share a lot of the same philosophies. We’ve known each other a long time and he knows I’ll be loyal to him. I think with an older coach sometimes that may be a concern,” Tappmeyer said. “I’m just looking forward to getting in and doing some on the floor coaching and to help him get the program going.”
 Shaw credits what he learned during his time with Coach Tapp as a Bearcat carries with him and the rest of the alumni to this day.
 “He taught us how to be men. If you look at his alumni, they’re very successful husbands and fathers and members of the community and fields they’re going into,” Shaw said. “It’s a testament to the culture that he set up and the people that he put around us. It all goes back to him.”

Rather than sending additional federal dollars to bail out state governments and add to our already astronomical federal debt, government at all levels must work together to target relief that has already been appropriated where it is needed most and ensure that federal funds are driven out to every community — both large and small, urban and rural.
 Congress acted quickly to pass several bipartisan relief packages addressing the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Those packages included hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency funding for states and local governments.
 The federal government has invested more than $25 billion in COVID-19 relief in Pennsylvania. When the federal government made the tough decision to add approximately $3 trillion to the federal debt, Congress came together in an overwhelmingly bipartisan way to help small businesses, provide direct assistance to individuals, bolster unemployment funding, and ensure necessary resources for our healthcare system. If not for Congress’ swift action, our already precarious economic situation would be even worse.
 In total — through various COVID-19 relief efforts that went directly to health care providers, schools, small businesses, and individuals — Pennsylvania has received well over $25 billion.
 The CARES Act, which Congress passed in mid-March with my support, authorized $150 billion for states and local governments to pay for unanticipated costs incurred as a result of COVID-19.
 Of that $150 billion, Pennsylvania received nearly $5 billion, with roughly $1 billion going directly to our seven largest counties and the rest going to the state to be driven out to local communities. To ensure that small and rural communities received the funding Congress intended, I led a Pennsylvania Republican congressional delegation letter to Gov. Wolf asking that he give full and fair consideration to rural communities and provide a plan for local governments to apply directly for funding.
 Pennsylvania’s General Assembly and governor agreed to a five-month stop gap budget as a wait-and-see approach to see if revenues rebound and Congress will send more money to state and local governments.
 Having served over eight years in Pennsylvania’s General Assembly, including over two terms on the House Appropriations Committee, I have first-hand experience with Pennsylvania’s systemic budgeting woes. Even halfway through Pennsylvania’s current fiscal year, before COVID-19, the state’s Independent Fiscal Office projected a $500 million state budget deficit.
 COVID-19 should not be used as an excuse to bail out state budgets, especially those with pre-existing structural deficits.
 In 2009, some states, including Pennsylvania, used non-recurring federal stimulus funding to plug recurring state General Fund budget holes. The result was disastrous.

New Delhi [India], May 28 (ANI): On the Menstrual Hygiene Day, actor Akshay Kumar recalled working in the film 'PadMan' and said that he is glad that he worked on the taboo subject.

"It's been 2 years to #PadMan and I'm glad we managed to push the envelope a little on this taboo subject," he tweeted.   "This #MenstrualHygieneDay, I hope we move a step closer towards ending period poverty and breaking taboos surrounding menstruation. @sonamakapoor   @radhika_apte," his tweet further read.

"I've always said that if you can ask the question of TNS and get close to them, it's a different animal then. When they're ten, twelve points clear it's very easy to relax and go get results. We've put pressure on them since January and the main difference is we've put consistency on them. Consistency doesn't guarantee results, but the results do come on the back of really good performances so it's definitely been the consistency this year that's been the difference.
 "It's obviously not ideal to win the title without finishing the season, we all want the euphoria and excitement of winning on the pitch but it wasn't to be. It was, for me, the right call to end the season when we did, and the only outcome that made any sense was Connah's Quay winning the league.
 "We've broken a trend of TNS winning eight titles on the spin so it was a fantastic achievement. Not the way we wanted to do it but it was the only feasible outcome.
 "The boys have worked incredibly hard, we've done the double this season with the League Cup, so it's been a great season. Winning the title and winning the League Cup it's been our outstanding season in the club's history."
 Morrison's vision of a successful club is something he has taken with him from those successive promotions at City in 1999 and 2000, explaining how everyone connected with the club at that time banded together in 'remarkable' fashion.
 He said: "I think the unity at the time between the board, management, players and fans was huge. Things had been a bit broken for a few seasons there. Managers coming in right, left and centre, and the relationship between the board and fans wasn't great. That period of time everybody came together, everybody saw the predicament the football club was in. Everybody started rowing in the same direction.
 "When you've got your board, your chairman, your management, your players and your fans - when everybody's in that boat together it's a very very strong position to be in. On the back of that City went and had back-to-back promotions to get back in the Premier League. The power of everyone being together.
 "It's something I've always held onto where I am now, having everybody singing off the same hymn sheet like we were at that time. The power and energy that created was remarkable at that time.
 "I think that's always remembered by the fans, that turnaround in the club's fortunes from a club that was obviously in decline. I think they appreciate the players and people who were at the club at that time and see it as a big part of where we are today."
 Morrison and his teammates from Joe Royle's side are fondly remembered by City fans, especially at this time of year when the anniversary of the 1999 play- off final win and 2000 promotion at Blackburn are recalled.
 "You want to be remembered wherever you were, you want to leave an impression," he says.
 "Whether I played for Blackpool or Blackburn or Plymouth and then obviously at City, you want to be remembered. You don't want to be in and gone in a couple of seasons and nobody remembers if you were there or not. I still speak with the players, there's such a fondness for that time and our careers. And still to be remembered and spoke about as playing a part in the club's history is fantastic.
 "I try to speak to my players and say wherever you go, wherever you play football, whatever you do, make sure you leave an impression. Ideally you leave the right impression. But for me the wrong impression is better than no impression. At least people know you've been in town.

We never see the unnamed boss for whom Julia Garner's self-effacing young assistant, Jane, works in this quietly chilling drama for the era of #MeToo and Time's Up. But it's not hard to imagine the toxic presence of a Harvey Weinstein - or someone equally sleazy - looming just out of sight. We keep Jane company as she goes through a typical day at the Manhattan film company she has recently joined - making the coffee, printing reports, fending phone calls from her boss's vexed wife. And we share her pent-up unease as it dawns on us what he is getting up to with the young aspiring actresses who visit his office. (Cleaning the boss's sofa is Jane's ickiest task.) Australian writer- director Kitty Green, her background in documentaries apparent in her film's humdrum realism, ensures we also share Jane's sense of helplessness - underlined on this day by her trip to see Matthew Macfayden's smoothly condescending HR boss. However much we may wish this to be the tale of a heroic whistleblower bringing down a sexual predator (you'll need to watch Bombshell for that), Jane is powerless in this particular office environment. All the same, Garner dominates the film, her mesmerising performance conveying the inner steel that's needed to survive a workplace like this.

What was never in doubt in my mind, however, before His Excellency found me worthy of service as his CPS, was that Ogun State was about to experience a leadership paradigm shift. Governor Abiodun had always made his vision of collectivism clear to the good people of Ogun; so much that, even during electioneering, almost every eligible voter knew his plans for the state and what those plans were hinged on. The Governor’s vision: “To give Ogun State focused and qualitative governance and to create the enabling environment for a public-private sector partnership, which is fundamental to the creation of an enduring economic development and individual prosperity of the people of Ogun”, led to the establishment of the Economic Transition Committee of eminent Ogun professionals, technocrats, political players (including those against whom the governor contested), as well as other stakeholder. A Work Group was also set up to develop a Blueprint and an Implementation Roadmap. According to His Excellency, the decision was to ensure that his government hit the ground running from the very day he was inaugurated.

An Associated Press analysis in April of available state and local data shows that nearly one-third of those who have died are African American, with black people representing about 14% of the population in the areas covered in the analysis.
 As can be seen in Lowndes, some health conditions that exist at higher rates in the black community make African Americans more susceptible to the virus, and they also are more likely to be uninsured.
 Alabama's figures reflect that national picture. About 27% of the state’s 4.9 million residents are black, but African Americans represent 44% of the 590 who have died.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.
 County administrator Jacquelyn Thomas used her fingers this week to count off five elderly Lowndes residents who’ve died of the disease recently. She fears what will happen as the state loosens restrictions even further, and the weather gets warmer.

Three decades in the making, Terry Gilliam's fabulously quixotic updating of Miguel de Cervantes' famous tale finally sees the light. At the turn of the millennium, Johnny Depp and Jean Rochefort were all set to play the leading roles of loyal squire and dotty knight - until the project collapsed amid a series of flabbergasting disasters, including a flash flood, overflying NATO warplanes and sudden illness, as related in 2002's tragicomic fly-on-the-wall documentary Lost in La Mancha. The film now stars Adam Driver as Toby, a cynically jaded director of commercials who revisits the Spanish village where he once cast Jonathan Pryce's local cobbler, Javier, as Quixote in his student film. The delusional Javier, it turns out, now believes he really is the knight and that Toby is his squire, Sancho Panza. It's a role Toby finds himself forced to play for real, more or less, when the pair go on the run from the police. The resulting adventure is inventive, chaotic, funny, and touchingly melancholy, giving Gilliam the opportunity to tilt his satirical lance at the modern world and offer a salute to die-hard dreamers everywhere.

Film noir is not a genre one readily associates with Romanian Cinema - best known for neorealist fare about the grey misery of life under communism. But this playfully slippery thriller doesn't only boast such familiar elements as a world-weary detective, a gorgeous femme fatale and a twisty plot, it's also cracking fun. Cristi (Vlad Ivanov), the movie's surprising hero, is a shady middle-aged cop striving to play off a crime cartel and his equally bent police colleagues against each other. Along the way, the gangsters send him to La Gomera in the Canary Islands to learn a secret whistling language (Silbo Gomero; it really exists), and his fate becomes bound up with the beautiful, enigmatic Gilda (Catrinel Marlon), girlfriend of one of the crooks. There is so much double dealing and double crossing going on, it will make your head spin. Don't worry if the plot slips out of your grasp. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

The economy isn't going to bounce back quickly on its own from the coronavirus pandemic. State reopenings, premature or not, will restore a modicum of economic activity, but it won't be enough to put many local businesses in the black. If the virus comes roaring back in states that reopen, it will cause a wave of fear that will depress demand and send some places back into lockdown. Meanwhile, wary consumers are saving their money, which will depress demand. And global trade networks and supply chains will remain in shambles for some time as the pandemic reverberates around the world. Meanwhile, although the pace of unemployment claims has slowed slightly, millions of Americans continue to lose their jobs.

ROME (AP) — Two months of lockdown have left style-conscious Italians looking less well-groomed than usual. But as of last week, hair salons and barber shops are back in business, welcoming young and old in need of a trim or a complete makeover.
 Associated Press photographers visited hairdressers in various parts of Rome as Italians had their lockdown locks sheared away. Customers ranged from children with untidy mops of hair and millennials craving a new style to young women eager to cover up regrowth, white-haired seniors looking for an elegant shine and regulars who were excited finally to be back in the barber chair.
 “I used to have my hair done once a week. It was strange yet fantastic to go back to my trusted hairdresser,” said Simone Abbattista, 24.
 Retiree Mariella Brazzati said she attempted to give herself a haircut during the lockdown, but decided it was too risky.
 “Thank God they reopened,” Brazzati said of the hair salon where she and other members of her family are long-time customers.
 Like elsewhere where hair salons are reopening, they are doing so in Italy under new social distancing rules to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Hairdressers wear gloves, face masks and protective visors, appointments must be booked in advance and salons must limit the number of customers inside, meaning some places have a waiting list of up to a month. There are partitions between seats, and after each use the seats and sinks are sanitized.

“I’ve talked to Coach Tapp and some of us alumni have talked to him for a few years now. He’s been interested in being an assistant coach,” Shaw said. “It shows a lot about our relationship and his belief in me and I hope that I and we can prove him right.”
 As the two join forces to compete on the same court again, it also features a return to the collegiate hardwood for Tappmeyer.
 “When I got out it was pretty much to the burn-out stage and a lot of that was the pressures of being a head coach and it’s hard to keep a balance,” Tappmeyer said. “I always loved the practice floor and things like that, game- planning, watching the tape and looking for recruits.”
 At the helm of the Bearcat basketball program from 1989 to 2009, Tappmeyer left Northwest as the winningest and longest serving coach for the school.
 His most recent stint as a head men’s college basketball coach was at University of Missouri-St. Louis for three years.
 Tappmeyer then coached the Owensville High School girls basketball to a third- place finish at the 2016 Missouri State High School Tournament.
 Even if it means Tappmeyer sits a few seats down the bench this time around, he knows Shaw’s has what it takes to lead a program.
 “I think somebody brought it up and said, ‘It’s amazing you’re working for him because you chewed him out so many times.’ But he was one of those guys that you could challenge and he was a competitor and pretty set in his ways and everything,” Tappmeyer said. “I think you can see he had the things it took to be a good head coach.”
 In his 21 seasons as head coach at Northwest, Shaw played under Tappmeyer from 2001 to 2005.
 “It’s kind of funny. I was a freshman when Jesse was a senior and him and Tapp didn’t get along real well that year,” Northwest Athletic Director and Bearcat alum Andy Peterson said with a laugh. “But there’s such a great respect there, obviously for all of us guys that played for Coach Tapp.”

Protesters began gathering in the early afternoon near the city's 3rd Precinct station, in the southern part of the city where 46-year-old Floyd died Monday. By the end of the night, protesters broke into a the precinct after the department abandoned it, setting it ablaze and setting off fireworks. The protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S.
 On Thursday, Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police, offered a softer tone in regards to Floyd's death.
 “I feel very, very badly," Trump said. "That’s a very shocking sight.”
 But just before 1 a.m. EDT Friday, Trump tweeted, "I can't stand back & watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis." He called out "very weak Radical Left" Mayor Jacob Frey to "get his act together" or he would send in the National Guard and "get the job done right."
 Trump added about the protesters that "these THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd."
 The president then said he told Gov. Tim Walz that the military is with him.
 "Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!" Trump concluded.

The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic depression are going to require huge amounts of government spending. Government is devoting resources to halting the outbreak. It's sustaining businesses during shutdowns so that they don't have to be rebuilt from scratch. It's paying the bills for workers who've lost their jobs. It's bailing out state and local governments whose tax revenues are disappearing and can't finance budget deficits. And it's taking on much of the debt from the financial system to ensure that a banking crisis doesn't follow the pandemic.

Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said.
 Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes.
 The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect.
 The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited.
 The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated.
 Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.

The future of aviation is looking a little greener today, with a nine-seat Cessna aircraft fitted out with an all electric propulsion system successfully completing its first flight. This maiden voyage for the world’s largest electric aircraft marks another step forward for a nascent industry out to shake up the world of air travel, which could one day look a lot cleaner and cost effective than it does now.
 This landmark flight was the product of a partnership between aerospace firm AeroTEC and electric propulsion company magniX, whose 750-horsepower (560 kW) magni500 propulsion system powered a modified six-seat seaplane through its first flight last December, with airline Harbour Air.
 That marked the first successful flight of an all-electric commercial aircraft, but the team at magniX had slightly bigger fish to fry. The company had also teamed up with AeroTEC to convert a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan from a jet-fuel burning nine-seater to an all-electric, zero-local-emissions, low- cost aircraft. And today they allowed it to strut its stuff for the first time.

Our analysis of what the biggest global companies in Switzerland are up to. This week: responsible business initiative back on the table, Lonza talks about vaccine production, and Kolmar under fire.  
 end of infobox
 The economy is getting back on solid footing here in Switzerland, giving many companies the nostalgic impulse to return to their pre-pandemic business ways. But is backwards what the people really want?
 The Responsible Business Initiative is headed back to parliament in June for another last-ditch effort at a counter proposal. If a public survey released this week is any indication, parliament will be under more pressure to reach a compromise or find itself at the mercy of Swiss voters, some 78% of whom support the initiative, according to the latest survey. That’s up 11 percentage points from February.
 This isn’t the only survey showing a more “woke” public. Market research firm Edelman called Covid-19 a “moment of reckoning” for business after its trust survey during the pandemic revealed that half of people believed business is doing poorlyexternal link or failing to put people before profits.

The WNCC awards were held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The winners of the WNCC all-campus awards were picked from nominations by the WNCC community and then a committee sorted through them.
 MVP award winners Fuchs and Passos are both sophomores on the team. Fuchs is from Denver but has family in Scotts Bluff County, while Passos, from Brazil, spent three years at WNCC after redshirting her first year because of an injury.
 Mueller was a freshman on the team last year and came to WNCC from Gering. Mueller led the Cougars in scoring with nine goals last fall while Fuchs powered home eight as the Cougar women won 13 matches and finished the season with the second most wins in school history. The most wins came in the inaugural soccer season in 2003 when WNCC won 19 matches.
 Mueller said the hard work she put in during her high school career at Gering is paying off. Mueller was not only a four-year starter on the soccer team, but was a placekicker for the Bulldog football team.
 “Getting a chance to be one of the MVPs means a lot to me,” she said. “All the years and hours I spent playing the game I love are paying off.”
 For both Fuchs and Passos, they had to deal with injuries their first year at WNCC. They fought through those injuries and earned MVP honors in their final year as a Cougar. Both have signed to continue playing at the four-year level with Fuchs heading to Concordia University in Seward while Passos is headed to Bethel University in Tennessee.
 “I’m very humbled to be recognized as one of the MVPs,” Fuchs said. “Personally, I felt like I really stepped it up from my freshman year to my sophomore year. I faced a major injury my freshman year and after what I went through, I was determined to not let anything get in my way or stop me this time around. I wanted to score goals, I wanted to leave it all on the field, I think I did exactly that.”
 Passos said this award is not hers alone, it is her teammates, too.
 “I feel really honored to be MVP and I am very happy with this accomplishment,” she said. “But, I know this wouldn’t be possible without my teammates. I confess I was a little surprised with this award, but I know I helped my team on and off the field.”
 While Fuchs, Passos and Mueller earned MVP honors, Vieira was surprised at being named Unsung Hero.
 “I am really amazed by winning this award because I see all my value,” Vieira, a sophomore from Brazil, said. “I see the reward for all my efforts the past two years. Truly, I am grateful for this recognition among the other athletes (that were named Unsung Heroes) because we can show that it is totally possible to keep high levels in both college and in sports matters at the same time.”

“They played ferociously,” Mallette said. “They played faced-paced, they attacked the basket a lot. They shot pretty well this season. They’re just guys who love the game. It starts with the athletic director, Ms. Sandy Barbour. She does a fantastic job. And it starts with Coach Chambers. He’s a fiery guy, and he competes. I love him. He’s a great man, and it starts with him and it trickles down to all of the players. The players embrace that attitude.”
 While Penn State will give Mallette the opportunity to hone his basketball skills at the Division I level, he said he’s also looking forward to attacking the academic side of college with the same vigor he does on the basketball court. He currently holds a 4.0 grade-point average.
 “I’m pretty much competitive in everything I do,” Mallette said. “I want to be the best, so in class, I want to get the best grade on the test. I want to get the best grade on an essay… The Smeal College of Business, the Morgan Academic Center are two great places. It has a fantastic business school.”
 Mallette said he’s talked with Penn State center John Harrar, who is pursuing a degree in business management.
 In addition to Penn State’s basketball program and academic prestige, Mallette was drawn to State College for an even more personal reason. His great grandfather graduated from Penn State in 1933 with a degree in architecture.
 Pacifica Christian coach Jeff Berokoff will enter his third season with Mallette this fall. Despite all of the basketball talent Mallette possesses, Berokoff pointed to the youngster’s leadership ability as being his most impressive trait. He offered a glimpse into what Penn State basketball’s program will get in Mallette.
 “He is the best leader of young men and his peers that I’ve ever coached,” Berokoff said. “I’ve had plenty of guys play Division I and a few kids were lucky enough to get to the NBA. Those kids who are really good all have that fire in the belly, they outwork others, and they’re talented and they have a belief in themselves. But what (Houston) does, I’ve never seen a kid be able to rally other teammates to follow him and to believe what he believes in. His mindset is he can accomplish anything, but he brings others along with that.”

Then-Gov. Ed Rendell and a Democrat-majority state House of Representatives insisted on using the finite federal stimulus money for public education increases that could never be sustained. In fact, the stimulus money ran out, leading to the persistent lie that Gov. Tom Corbett “cut” public education funding despite the fact that the state actually increased the state’s share of public education funding to a record high.
 Moreover, much of the commonwealth’s current budget woes resulted from loss of revenue caused by Gov. Wolf’s reactionary and overbroad closing of the state’s economy and lack of a cogent plan to re-open. A swift and safe re-opening of the state’s economy is likely to go a long way to restoring much of the state’s revenue loss.
 While some in Washington and Harrisburg may believe that another COVID-19 stimulus bill is inevitable, remember two things.
 First, the best economic stimulus is a steady job. Pennsylvanians have cooperated with stay-at-home orders and allowed our health care system to build capacity to deal with COVID-19. We must allow businesses to reopen so hardworking Pennsylvanians can provide for their families and the state can resume normal revenue collection.
 Second, much of the CARES Act funding has not yet reached its final destinations. Congress must seriously balance the burden of another massive stimulus bill and our mounting federal debt, which is merely a crippling tax hike on our children and grandchildren, and the extent that states like Pennsylvania can help themselves with a smart approach to budgeting and recovering from this pandemic.

With parts of the Texas economy starting to reopen, some Austin-area home services companies say -- with an abundant amount of caution -- that they see signs of hope for their industries.
   
 Austin-based Revent Remodeling and Construction, a home renovation service, saw a decline in business when the coronavirus pandemic led to widespread uncertainty, said company founder John Gioffre.
   
 Gioffre, who started the company in 2018, said most of his clients are people who are making improvements to their place of residence, as opposed to those who are making renovations to sell homes on the market.
   
 REBUILDING AMERICA: Chronicling the reopening of the US after coronavirus pandemic closures
   
 "The vast majority of our customers are people who are looking to make their dream homes," Gioffre said.
   
 He said many of his customers opted to put off projects as health officials began ramping up warnings about the spread of COVID-19.
   
 Gioffre said some customers asked for refunds on payments that had been made on materials, while other asked the company to leave projects unfinished.
   
 Gioffre said he has tried to be flexible with clients during the crisis.
   
 "I gave them the option that whatever they are comfortable with is what we will do, because the last thing that we want to do is put someone in a position during a pandemic where their contractors is now pressuring them," Gioffre said.
   
 Gioffre said he is starting to hear back from some of the clients who are now ready to resume home improvement projects.
   
 Gioffre said he has hired a new project manager to prepare for an increase in work as local shelter-in-place orders are gradually lifted.
   
 "Hopefully, we'll come out of this stronger than we were before," he said.
   
 Raul Castillo, manager of Austin Tool, said he has seen an uptick in business in the past few weeks. He said the tool shop, which has been open for 37 years, works with many local contractors, including those in construction, as well as plumbing and electrician services.
   
 Castillo said his shop has remained open and busy despite shelter-in-place orders, because many of his customers were allowed to continue to operate under local regulations.
   
 "It has mostly been contractors," Castillo said. "It looks like people who have home-based projects are still a bit too scared to come out."
   
 He said the store has been able to retain its employees despite seeing a reduction in business, due to a consistent stream of revenue coming from tool rentals for contractors and workers who conduct home-based services.
   
 "You have a lot of people who are like, 'I need to work. I need to put food on the table,' So, it seems like they start trickling in," Castillo said.
   
 Castillo said he thinks it will still take some time for the store to see its usual flow of patrons, but said he is already starting to hear from more casual customers.
   
 "We have managed keep a good record with our customers, and that's why they keep coming back," he said.

“They’ve seen a much lower sick call right across the board when it comes to infection, so they’re going to keep that. And we’re going to keep some other practices," said Esper, adding that by breaking the recruits into smaller groups, “they’ve seen a higher level of unity and esprit. And they bonded much more quickly.”
 As Esper walked around the soggy field, recruits were going through what Marines call the “confidence course.” They were clambering over large log obstacles, climbing towers, shimmying across rope lines strung over a net, and swinging over streams of water. In other sections, recruits were paired off to battle with pugil sticks, which replicates rifle and bayonet combat.
 Staff Sgt. Katheryn Hunter, a drill instructor for three years at Parris Island, said the main difference she sees due to the virus is that the number of female recruits she has in 4th Battalion, Oscar Company, has dropped to 70. And she has 35 recruits in squad bays that usually hold up to 64.
 During the initial portion of training, women, who have their own battalion, are largely separated from men. Marine Corps leaders staunchly defend the segregation, saying it helps build confidence, but some members of Congress have demanded change.
 On the confidence course, female recruits were together on the various obstacles, while the male recruits were doing other tests.
 The course, Hunter said, is critical.
 “We have a lot of recruits that are scared of heights, recruits that are scared of water or are scared of different obstacles,” she said, adding that the course ”actually tests recruits' fears, also builds their confidence that they can accomplish stuff as long as they set their minds to it."

Indonesian officials are forcing social distancing violators to recite Koran verses, stay in "haunted" houses and submit to public shaming on social media as the country battles to contain surging coronavirus infections.
 The Southeast Asian archipelago began deploying around 340,000 troops across two dozen cities to oversee enforcement of measures aimed at halting transmission of the disease, such as wearing facemasks in public.
 But provincial leaders are buttressing these efforts with their own zealous campaigns to fight the virus.
 Police in western Bengkulu province have assembled a 40-person squad to find lockdown scofflaws and force them to wear placards with promises to wear masks and keep their distance from others in future.
 Pictures of the perpetrators are then uploaded to social media for maximum shaming effect, according to an official.
 "People in Bengkulu still aren't aware of the importance of following the rules, especially when it comes to wearing masks and not gathering" in big groups, said Martinah, Bengkulu's public order agency chief, who goes by one name.
 "This is for the sake of themselves and their families," he added.
 Some of those singled out by police have bristled at the punishment, including fisherman Firmansyah, who was punished for failing to abide by the mask rule while alone on his boat.
 "It's silly to wear a mask when I'm out at sea," he said, after he was nabbed returning to shore.
 "There's no regulation to wear a mask in the water. If there was I'd comply with it."
 Farther north in conservative Aceh province, those flouting public health regulations have been forced to atone by reading passages from the Koran.
 The area's tiny non-Muslim minority are spared from the punishment.
 "If we find them not wearing face masks they'll just be reprimanded," said local government spokeswoman Agusliayana Devita.
 Capital city Jakarta announced new rules this month that could see residents who break social distancing rules forced to clean public facilities -- including toilets -- while wearing vests that label them as rule-breakers.
 To the east in Sragen regency, offenders have been jailed in repurposed abandoned houses that local residents believe are haunted -- tapping widespread beliefs in the supernatural, which play a key role in Indonesian folklore.
 Indonesia has confirmed around 24,000 cases of COVID-19 and 1,496 deaths, but the country of more than 260 million has some of the lowest testing rates in the world.
 Researchers estimate the true number of virus fatalities is several times the official toll.

Colleen Segarra, president of Equine Rescue Resource Inc. in Pine Bush, knows firsthand the joy a horse can bring to people. Who needs more joy these days than seniors in nursing homes?
   
 "Everyone is worried about the pandemic," said Segarra, "and we thought our well-behaved senior horses would maybe cheer up a few nursing home residents and bring something positive to them."
   
 Segarra, along with her kids and husband, brought Bob, a 28-year-old quarter horse, and Denali, a 31-year-old Arabian, to visit residents of the Montgomery Nursing & Rehabilitation Center May 15 through their windows.
   
 "It was just wonderful," said nursing home Activities Director Noreen Colletti. "The residents were just so happy. Some were shocked when they saw the horses going by. A lot of them came to the window, it was perfect."
   
 While following state guidelines, Colletti has been forced to think outside the box when it comes to residents' activities through windows. She has had a guitar player serenade them, animals visiting, and a violin player is planned. Anyone else willing to entertain residents through their windows is urged to call Colletti at 457-3155, Ext. 240.
   
 "I couldn't believe the horses were looking in the windows," Colletti said. "Bob stuck his head right to the window. Mouths were wide open, they were full of excitement. That generation is very thankful for anything you do.
   
 "It's really tough for them during this time; they can't see their families. They do Facetime and Zoom, but I want to make their lives special and put a smile on their faces. They're my peeps. I'm very blessed to have this job."
   
 Segarra was also thrilled with the reactions Bob and Denali got from smiling residents.
   
 "One lady couldn't get out of bed, but when she saw us, she was moving her arms like she was galloping on a horse," she said. "Bob was all about it, putting his nose in the windows. Every time he did something good, I gave him a cookie.
   
 "Everyone needs a boost right now, and their smiles lifted our spirits, too. I'm so glad we could do this for our community."
   
 Resident Alice Strucker enjoyed her equine visitors.
   
 "It made me so happy to see those beautiful horses," she said. "My grandson likes to ride, and he trains horses. Seeing the horses made me think of him, and that made me happy, too."
   
 Equine Rescue Resource Inc. is just one of the many shelters and our rescues that are hurting financially through this pandemic. ERR's spring fundraising events, which fund the special senior feed it needs for Bob, Denali and two other senior horses, were canceled. Segarra hopes that the Record's $3 Shelter Challenge (see below/page #?) will help make up for those lost funds.
   
 "It's not a normal year for anybody," she said, "but anything helps. I don't care what it is, it all adds up to buying a bale of hay. It all helps."
