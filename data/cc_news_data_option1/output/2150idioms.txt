 Wes Tobin started and ended the 2020 baseball season at Southern New Hampshire University on a down note.
   
 In between, the 6-foot-3, 235-pound senior righty from Portsmouth pitched some pretty good baseball.
   
 A former standout at Portsmouth Christian Academy in Dover, Tobin was roughed up in SNHU's opener at Colorado Mesa on Feb. 14, 22-5, and then like all spring college athletes felt the pain when the NCAA canceled the spring season across the board in March due to the escalating COVID-19 pandemic, which has now claimed over 106,000 American lives.
   
 He ended up fashioning a 3-1 record with a 5.68 ERA. SNHU was 12-4 at the time of the cancellation, ranked No. 10 in the nation in NCAA Division II. After being swept in their three-game opening series at Colorado Mesa, then No. 2 in the nation, the Penmen won 12 of their next 13 games.
   
 "I was very nervous about starting the first game of the year," said Tobin of the Colorado Mesa start. "I left everything over the middle of the plate and up in the zone and got whacked around pretty good."
   
 Indeed, in his 2 1/3 innings of work, Tobin surrendered 10 runs (nine earned) on 12 hits, including four home runs.
   
 "I tried to forget it, but it's always there in the back of my mind," he said.
   
 "It was earlier than we've ever asked to be out there," coach Scott Loiseau said. "It was a long trip out there. I would never make excuses for Wes. It was a 22-hour travel day the day before. We practiced that night and then got up and played a game.
   
 "He started great. Honestly, they hit two cheap home runs really quickly. That kind of got the ball rolling for those guys."
   
 Tobin settled down after that and had three quality starts, all wins.
   
 He beat Felician University in Myrtle Beach, S.C., 5-2, on Feb. 21, going seven strong innings. He allowed two earned runs on six hits, walked two and whiffed six.
   
 On March 1, he handled New York Institute of Technology, 7-2, the team that eliminated SNHU in the 2019 Super Regional. He gave up two runs (one earned) on six hits with a walk and six strikeouts.
   
 In his final start on March 9 at Adelphi, a 10-4 win, he went all nine innings. He gave up four earned runs on eight hits, struck out four and did not walk a batter.
   
 "I was able to pitch all right after (Colorado Mesa)," Tobin said. "I was definitely ready to roll right into conference play, chase those teams and win some games there."
   
 SNHU felt it had the juice to make another run to the NCAA tournament where it advanced every year from 2012 to 2019, including two trips to the D-II College World Series.
   
 "When I looked at our schedule and our opponents' record, there wasn't a team that really scared me," Tobin said. "We were all feeling pretty good. We were playing some pretty good baseball."
   
 Last year, SNHU went 40-15, winning the East Regional before losing in the NCAA Super Regional to NYIT. Tobin's record was 8-3 with a 2.67 ERA. His eight wins were the most on the Penmen staff as he earned All-Northeast-10 Conference Second Team honors.
   
 As a sophomore, Tobin was primarily a reliever for a SNHU squad that went 41-17, advancing to the College World Series where they went 2-2. He appeared in 18 games with a 3-1 record, two saves and a 1.91 ERA.
   
 "He throws strikes with three pitches," Loiseau said. "He added a changeup this year. He's everything you kind of want in a starting pitcher. He throws a lot of strikes and gets the free out with the K. He has the ability to pitch out of trouble. He commands the baseball so you're not moving guys around the bases, getting the ball to the backstop or in the dirt. He's quick enough to the plate where guys just can't run on him. You've got to earn your runs against him. Honestly, if he didn't give up home runs, people would very rarely score."
   
 The NCAA granted all spring athletes an extra year of eligibility if they so choose to use it. Tobin plans to.
   
 "My classes are set up so that I have a full two semesters to get my degree," he said. "It benefits me in a way to go back for another year."
   
 Tobin is currently working for his father's Dover-based construction company framing houses. "I'm trying to get my body in the best shape possible for the fall so I can be better than years before," he said.
   
 He doesn't plan to pitch this summer, opting to give his arm a break to get it back to feeling as healthy as possible.
   
 "Obviously, we're super lucky to have him back," Loiseau said. "It'll be interesting to see how some things unfold here with higher education and fall athletics. I'd say we're still a long way from knowing enough to feel comfortable about anything."
   
 Loiseau says Tobin has a shot at professional baseball. "This year not having a season, we'll see how it kind of affects him next year in terms of the next level. Hopefully he'll get an opportunity. He certainly deserves it."

title: "Music therapist's siren song draws seniors and others out of their shell",


--DocBreak--
And yet … Last week I wondered whether my silence is part of the problem. Am I unknowingly one of them, too?
 I’ve heard things. I’ve seen things. And I look the other way. Because I’m not like that. My family isn’t like that. My community isn’t like that. So, I’ll keep living my quiet life, in my perfect town and will pray it all goes away.
 That proves I’m not racist, right?
 This week, I listened to a tough conversation from a friend of color. We talked about the riots. We talked about the hurt and the hate. And in her words, “I fear for my son’s life,” I finally heard her.
 And it made me uncomfortable.
 I live in a safe, white bubble.
 You probably do, too.

We can say it was ignorance, hate and fear that caused the white police officer to plant his knee firmly in Floyd’s neck and asphyxiate him. That officer and others whose actions widen the racial divide must be accountable for their violence. The officer who caused Floyd’s death belongs behind bars.
 As for the Americans who, through their silence and inaction are tacitly prolonging our nation’s ugly racist history, we urge you to reconsider. Regardless if you live in a metropolis or in the rural countryside, you can make a difference by adopting a new attitude about diversity and inclusion.
 Put an end to ignorance by getting acquainted with people who are different. How? Talk about the weather, compliment them on their children, ask about their work. It may surprise you, but weather, children and work are universal topics, and there are many others.
 Get to know people of different races and you’ll discover that what we have in common is stronger than what is holding us apart.
 As for the scores of demonstrators who marched in cities across the nation last weekend, the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment enshrines freedom of speech and the right to peacefully address problems with government. The Constitution doesn’t protect acts of violence and vandalism. Smashing windows, looting businesses and attacking law enforcement are not the American way.
 That ugly brand of protest is rooted in anger and frustration; however, history has shown that standing in the way of peaceful revolution risks making violent revolution inevitable.
 It’s time for all Americans to live up to the ideals of freedom and equality by embracing diversity and inclusion. Let’s end the disease of racism.
