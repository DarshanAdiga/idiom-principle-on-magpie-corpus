Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly, however, made it clear that while several thousand will leave the ship, other sailors will remain on board in order to continue to protect the ship and run critical systems.

STEVEN MNUCHIN: Jim, you have to keep talking about it and get everybody to sign up. So, you know, I want to thank all the people at the SBA and Treasury who have literally been working 24 hours. The fact we’ve been able to get up a new program in less than a week is just extraordinary. As you said, this not only covers small businesses, it will cover independent contractors, as well as self-employed and sole proprietors. It will take an extra week for us to get that up and running. So, that will be up and running next Friday. And I just want to thank everyone in the government who delivered on our commitment to get this up and running tomorrow.

The document requires all ships in U.S. waters to report their numbers of sick and dead on board each day or face civil penalties or criminal prosecution. The Coast Guard will decide if a transfer is absolutely necessary, but the cruise line would be responsible for arranging on-shore transportation and hospital beds.

STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, Jim, we’ll continue to work with you on that. As I said, our focus is making sure these programs get up and running. We’ve got $6 trillion to put into the economy. That should create a lot of liquidity, and a lot of help for small businesses and American workers. And as we deliver on that liquidity, it’s going to create a lot of help for small business. So, that’s really our focus. As I said, we’ll be working with the President on infrastructure and other areas to continue to work with Congress on.

Focuri de armă la granița moldo-română. Polițiștii de frontieră de peste Prut au depistat aproape 12.000 de pachete cu țigări care urmau să fie transportate din R.Moldova în România. Totul a avut loc în noaptea de întâi aprilie, în zona din apropierea punctului de trecere Rădăuți-Prut. În timp ce patrulau prin zonă, oamenii legii au observat mai multe persoane care încărcau colete voluminoase într-un autoturism de teren. Când și-au dat seama că polițiștii se apropie de ei, contrabandiștii au abandonat coletele și s-au dus de la fața locului. Polițiștii de frontieră s-au luat după ei. Șoferul, evident nu a oprit la somații, de aceea oamenii legii au fost nevoiți să tragă mai multe focuri de armă în pneurile mașinii. Din cauza vitezei, șoferul a acroșat cu vehiculul un copac. Cei aflați în mașină au abandonat vehiculul și au fugit. Despre caz a fost informată și poliția din Republica Moldova, pentru documentarea în comun a cazului. Cele 11.800 de pachete cu țigări au fost confiscate. Polițiștii continuă cercetările.

O reporteriță din Statele Unite a avut parte de peripeții în timp ce încerca să înregistreze un material pentru postul de televiziune la care lucrează, din bucătăria sa. În timp ce vorbea, tânăra a fost întreruptă de tatăl său, care a apărut în cadru, pe jumătate dezbrăcat. După ce bărbatul și-a dat seama de situație, s-a îmbrăcat rapid cu un tricou. În urma întâmplării, reporterița, amuzată, a postat filmulețul pe rețelele sociale cu descrierea: „Mi-au spus să lucrez de acasă și mi-au mai spus că totul va decurge bine”. În urma postării, imaginile au devenit virale și au fost văzute de peste 500.000 de ori. Tânăra a fost nevoită să filmeze de acasă, în contextul izolării din cauza pandemiei de coronavirus. Work from home they said, it’ll be fine they said. pic.twitter.com/e2eK6IH6r5— Jessica Lang (@jessdlang) March 28, 2020

Dozens of cruise ships are either lined up at Port Miami and Port Everglades or waiting offshore due to the coronavirus pandemic. Most have only crew aboard, but Carnival Corp., which owns nine cruise lines with a total of 105 ships, notified the SEC Tuesday that it has more than 6,000 passengers still at sea, on three ships that will soon arrive in Fort Civitavecchia, Italy, and Southampton, England, as well as Fort Lauderdale.

Government needs to come clean to frontline health workers’

STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, both the Fed and Treasury have a team of people. We’re meeting on this every day. It’s a very big priority. It’s something we’re focused on, the design. But we want to make sure that mid-market companies have access to liquidity. And, again, I can’t comment on the exact timing, but let me say it will hopefully be soon. Because again, all these programs, we want to get up and running so that they’re available for small business help and American workers quickly. That’s our objective and we’ll be delivering on that shortly.

The writing had been on the wall for weeks, as various studies had concluded that when mild or asymptomatic cases of coronavirus infection were taken into account, the death rate could be well south of 1 percent. This is cold comfort, given the fact the United States is expecting upward of 100,000 deaths, but it gives us a better idea of what we're dealing with.

Under normal conditions, when a passenger or crew member become too ill for the ship’s medical team to care for, they call the Coast Guard to provide a medical evacuation to an onshore hospital. Under the new rules, sick passengers would be sequestered indefinitely on board.

STEVEN MNUCHIN: Jim, as I said, this program is going to be up and running tomorrow. I’m pleased that working with the SBA on small business help, we’ll be able to deliver it. As you said, the paycheck protection program, you can take out a loan for up to eight weeks of payroll as well as overhead. You hire the people back -- as long as you hire the people back, the loan is forgiven. I would encourage every small business go to Treasury.gov, there’s a red banner on the top, click on it, you will get the information. And you can go to any SBA lender, you can go to any FDIC Insured Bank and any credit union, call your lender, see if they participate. I very much want people to sign up for this. It’s a great way to hire people back or make sure you’re getting paid if you have people at work. And this will cover about 50% of the payroll of the private enterprises.

The body releases heat and, therefore, reduces fever. This substance is a natural antiviral and benefits the immune system. Ginger can be drunk in an infusion or it is possible to take a bath with ginger powder. When the bathtub is full, you just have to add the powder and ginger oil and leave it on for 10 minutes before taking a 10-minute bath.

Normal imperatives like academic credit have been set aside. Online repositories make studies available months ahead of journals. Researchers have identified and shared hundreds of viral genome sequences. More than 200 clinical trials have been launched, bringing together hospitals and laboratories around the globe.
 “I never hear scientists — true scientists, good quality scientists — speak in terms of nationality,” said Dr. Francesco Perrone, who is leading a coronavirus clinical trial in Italy. “My nation, your nation. My language, your language. My geographic location, your geographic location. This is something that is really distant from true top-level scientists.”
 On a recent morning, for example, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh discovered that a ferret exposed to COVID-19 particles had developed a high fever — a potential advance toward animal vaccine testing. Under ordinary circumstances, they would have started work on an academic journal article.
 “But you know what? There is going to be plenty of time to get papers published,” said Paul Duprex, a virologist leading the university’s vaccine research. Within two hours, he said, he had shared the findings with scientists around the world on a World Health Organization conference call. “It is pretty cool, right? You cut the crap, for lack of a better word, and you get to be part of a global enterprise.”
 For Donald Trump, the unabashedly “America First” president, Duprex and other American scientists represent the world’s best hope for a vaccine. “America will get it done!” the president declared.

STEVEN MNUCHIN: Jim, let me say before I get to the mortgage market, with you are executing on these small business help plans. We have the SBA plan, as I said the plan of direct deposit, which is going to be up and running in another few weeks, that will get money into people’s accounts. We also have enhanced unemployment insurance. So, hopefully, workers, no fault of their own, who are not working because of this, they are going to get money in their pockets and to the extent that they have problems with mortgages, the FHA has already come out and said they will forebear. So, what that means is if people don’t have jobs and people have hardship, they can forebear. If people do have jobs, we expect those people to continue to pay mortgages. But that will be dealt with on a bank by bank basis. The most important thing is that FHA loans, GSE loans, Fannie and Freddie, which is the majority of the market, the government will be giving people time to pay those loans.

Self isolating can be fun for your furry friend and also good for your health. Houston resident, Darr and his D.O.G. were out for their daily walk and practicing social distancing. Even outdoors you are to remain two metres from each other unless you live in the same household. Being outside does not make it safer to be close together. It may be good for your mental health to be outside but stay around your municipality, stay close to home and local trails. (Angelique Houlihan photo)
