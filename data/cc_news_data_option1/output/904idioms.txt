HAMPTON -- It was just a simple unexpected basket at the end of the first quarter, but when a game goes into overtime every point along the way counts as much as another.
   
 And these two points the Winnacunnet High School boys basketball team received at the end of the opening eight minutes in Tuesday's Division I contest against Windham never should have happened.
   
 There was 0.4 seconds left in the quarter and Windham's Joey DaSilva, standing to the right of his own basket, was set to throw a long inbounds pass to a teammate down the floor in an attempt for a desperation buzzer-beater.
   
 DaSilva's pass hit the rafters near midcourt and the Warriors regained possession from the same spot -- to the right of the Windham basket with 0.4 seconds still remaining on the clock.
   
 "The sixth defender," Winnacunnet head coach Jay McKenna said in reference to DaSilva's pass. "That's an old Jack Ford saying. He used to refer to that as the sixth defender. We got fortunate with that. We were just trying to defend (that pass) and not let them get a shot off."
   
 The Warriors, with James O'Hara throwing the ball, drew up a play.
   
 O'Hara lofted a perfect pass to junior Lucas Schaake, who simultaneously caught the ball in the paint and took his shot. The ball went in and the Warriors took a 14-12 lead into the second quarter.
   
 "That's a play that we have run over time and it worked out, and (Schaake) was able to get the ball to go in," McKenna said. "Fast forward to the end of the game and that was a huge basket. (Schaake) is pretty strong there and he gets up pretty well. We figured he could get up over the crowd and finish in there. It was perfectly executed, and if you put it that in relation to the rest of the game that was a huge basket for us."
   
 Schaake finished with eight points on the night.

A new church will plant roots in downtown Farmington with a vision of becoming a living hope for all who worship together.
 The Living Hope Christian Family Church will be a non-denominational, Christian church that will worship in a leased space at 400 Third St. on the corner of Oak Street in downtown Farmington.
 The church will welcome the community to its 10 a.m. Sunday worship after it opens in the middle of March after internal building construction is complete.
 Pastors Linda and David Cross have been leading the Christian Family Church of Lakeville in a leased space in the Heritage Center since 2014.
 “We changed the name because we have moved to Farmington, and we decided upon Living Hope because we consider our faith in Christ Jesus as a living hope because he is alive and lives in us and we wanted a name that depicts life,” said Linda Cross. The new church name is based on a Bible scripture from the book of Peter.
 “We knew you needed to get your own building in order to grow,” she said, adding how the congregation will now have its own space to host special events.
 “Our goal is to win souls, make disciples and build the church and we have a heart to reach this area and the world as with Bible schools,” she said.
 The couple will celebrate 46 years of marriage this year, and both love to preach as licensed and ordained ministers. They began working in ministry in 1985 after both graduating from Rhema Bible College in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As natives to Faribault, they returned after graduation to launch a church called Harvest Time Bible Church. After building this church in Faribault for 18 years, they decided to move to Arizona to start another church where they were for nine years. The Crosses moved back to Minnesota to be closer to family. They have two children, four grandchildren and one great grandson.
 The Crosses, who have been leading churches for 35 years, also work full-time jobs outside of the ministry. David works as a banking mortgage underwriter, and Linda works as a licensed, insurance broker for supplemental insurance plans.

For Sophia, that's meant exploring her family's chosen line of work. A graduate of Los Angeles High School of the Arts, "I know she's going to make a go of it in the business, which I support," Macy, 69, told _Parade_ just months before news of the scandal broke. "I've seen her; she's good, she's really good."
 With her dreams of attending the acting program that--as Macy put in a letter he wrote to Huffman's judge ahead of sentencing, "ironically doesn't require SAT scores," dashed--she's nonetheless recovering from the desolation she felt roughly a year ago. Describing how his eldest initially called them from the airport "in hysterics" after hearing the news, Macy wrote, "From the devastation of that day, Sophia is slowly regaining her equilibrium and getting on with her life."
 Same for Georgia. Enjoying a different college admissions experience than her sibling, thanks to her parents' decision not to employ the same SAT-altering tactics, she quietly applied and was accepted to Vassar College, a prestigious liberal arts school roughly two hours north of New York City. "She's interested in politics, political science and pursuing that," Macy told _Parade  _of the high schooler. "She's in a very academic school and killing it."

Niklas Sule has begun training with a ball again as the Bayern Munich defender continues his recovery from a knee injury.
 The 24-year-old has not played since rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in October and it was initially feared he could miss the rest of the domestic season and Euro 2020.
 Sule suggested his recovery was ahead of schedule in December as he vowed to return to fitness in time to make Joachim Low's Germany squad for the tournament.
 On Thursday, the centre-back said he felt "fantastic" to be out on the pitch with a football at Bayern's Sabener Strasse training base, despite the inclement weather.
 "After more than four months, it feels great to be back on the ball again. It's really fantastic," Sule told the club's website.
 "It could have snowed today or [Storm] Sabine could have returned, but I wouldn't have cared. I'm just happy to be training with the ball again and taking the next steps in my rehab.
 "So far I haven't had any problems at all. I've made a lot of controlled movements with the ball, and next week we’ll gradually introduce directional changes with the ball as well."
 There was a further boost for Bayern as Javi Martinez and Lucas Hernandez put in extra work despite having a scheduled day off.
 Martinez returned to the squad for the 6-0 Bundesliga win at Hoffenheim last weekend, having been out since December with a thigh problem, while Hernandez has been struggling with a ligament complaint.
 Bayern hope both defenders will be available for Sunday's game with Augsburg.
 Kingsley Coman, who pulled a muscle in the 3-0 win at Chelsea in the first leg of the Champions League last 16, is also hoping to be available for this weekend's match after resuming running this week.
 Bayern, who are three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga, will then head to Union Berlin on March 14 before the second leg at home to Chelsea four days later.
 They then host Eintracht Frankfurt before the latest international break.

PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota lawmakers remained split Thursday on whether they can afford inflationary pay increases for teachers, state employees and community service providers as the Legislature looks to finalize the state budget next week. Republicans who control the Legislature are noncommittal on a 2% increase but say they would like to see some sort of pay raise. Democrats said their top priority this year is pushing GOP lawmakers to get the 2%, which would be about $32 million. School districts often give pay raises to teachers regardless of the inflationary budget increases, but must carve out that money from other programs. House Majority Leader Lee Qualm, a Republican from Platte, said that raising pay by 2% is impossible unless cuts are made to other budget items. But Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jim Bolin, a Canton Republican, said he is hopeful they could find the money. Democrats complained that Republicans have been too conservative in adopting revenue estimates, leading to a tight budget.

 LORETTO, Pa. -- Keith Braxton scored 27 points and Randal Gaskins added 20 to pace Saint Francis (Pa.) past Bryant, 87-61, in the Northeast Conference quarterfinal Wednesday night.
 The Red Flash opened the game on a 22-4 run -- extending their lead to 22 points in the first half -- and led by at least 11 the rest of the way to oust the Bulldogs from the NEC tournament for the third time in four years.
 Bulldogs (15-17) senior Adam Grant scored 13 points and freshman Michael Green III added 12, but a fast start by Saint Francis (21-9) proved too much to overcome.
 A Grant 3-pointer got Bryant back within 12 at 36-24 with 4:33 to play in the half but the Bulldogs trailed, 45-31, at the break. Saint Francis then went on a 13-0 run in the second half to seal the victory.
 The Bulldogs shot 33.3% for the game while the Red Flash shot 57.1%. Hall Elisias grabbed a team-high seven rebounds, edging St. Francis, 38-37, on the glass. The Red Flash are 11-0 when holding opponents to 42.9% or worse from the field.
 Saint Francis, the NEC Tournament's No. 2 seed, has won its last six home games. The Red Flash will face No. 3 seed Sacred Heart in the semifinal round on Saturday.

SOLON, Maine -- A U.S. Senate hopeful who left the Maine Green Independent Party to make it easier to get onto the November ballot has collected enough signatures to clear the hurdle, her campaign said Tuesday.
   
 Supporters of Lisa Savage, an educator from Solon, collected more than 6,000 signatures, a spokesman said. If the signatures are certified, there will be a third ballot choice in addition to GOP Sen. Susan Collins and the winner of a Democratic primary.
   
 Maine's ranked-choice voting could come into play with three candidates. The voting system lets voters rank candidates on the ballot and allows multiple voting rounds to ensure a majority winner.
   
 Savage's decision to run as an independent freed her from the requirement of getting signatures from 2,000 Greens by March 15. As an independent, Savage had to gather double the signatures -- 4,000 -- but those signatures could come from any registered Maine voter before a June 1 deadline.
   
 Even though she's running as an independent, she said her platform remains as "Green as ever" and that she will seek the Green Independent Party's endorsement.

Another area where pets excel and may seem psychic is with their senses. While they have access to all of the same sensory information that we do, they can also tap into their senses and hear and smell a host of other things. Dogs have a much larger area of the brain dedicated to olfaction and a more powerful nose that they can use to pick up smells. Cats and dogs can also hear things in frequencies that we cannot pick up. Because of their height, our dogs and cats may also pick up on different visual stimuli than we do. All of this puts their senses outside of our sensory range, so they basically possess "extra-sensory" perception.

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — Ivory Coast’s President Alassane Ouattara said Thursday that he will not run for re-election in October, ending speculation that he would try for a third term. \"I would like to solemnly announce that I have decided not to be a candidate in the presidential election on October 31, 2020 and to transfer power to a young generation,” he said before deputies and senators in the capital, Yamoussoukro. “It was an honor to serve my country.” For some time, Ouattara had remained silent about his plans. Opponents said he didn’t have a constitutional right to a third term, but he had said that he would run if his longtime rival, former president Laurent Gbagbo, became a candidate. When Ouattara was first elected in 2010, Gbagbo, who was president at that time, refused to acknowledge the win, leading to months of violence that claimed more than 3,000 lives. Gbagbo was acquitted last year at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against humanity for his role in the post-election violence. However, he remains in Europe pending an appeal by the prosecution. It is unclear if he would try to stand as a candidate, but Ivory Coast has seen a rise in political tensions ahead of the October 31 elections.

 After disappointing results on Super Tuesday, including a third place finish in her home state, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren plans to suspend her campaign for president on Thursday, further whittling the field of Democratic contenders, according to reports in the New York Times and elsewhere.
 Warren had been hoping to rack up enough delegates on Tuesday in the 14 states that voted to continue in the race and present herself as a compromise candidate between the moderate and liberal factions of the party. However, her failure to crack the top two in any state, and a stinging finish in Massachusetts behind the surprise winner Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders left her without a path forward.
 Biden and Sanders are now the last remaining serious contenders for the party's nomination. Warren spent Tuesday night in Detroit, appearing to be looking ahead to Tuesday's Michigan primary in Michigan. It was reported Wednesday, however, that she returned to Cambridge to huddle with her team and reassess the campaign's viability. The New York Times reported Thursday that she planned to start informing her staff of her decision later in the morning. Warren plans to hold a press conference at 12:30 p.m., though the exact location was not immediately available.
 Once considered a front-runner for the Democratic nomination, Warren built a well-staffed campaign around the country after entering the race on New Year's Eve in 2018, eschewing big-dollar fundraisers and developing a thick volume of policy plans that included a wealth tax that she said would pay for everyone from child care to free college tuition.
 Warren was re-elected to a second term in the Senate in 2018, meaning she has five years before she would be on the ballot again in Massachusetts, if she seeks re-election. Her departure from the presidential race means that some of the political energy in Massachusetts will shift to the Senate primary between Sen. Ed Markey and U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, both of whom backed Warren's campaign for the White House, and the wide open race to fill the seat that Kennedy is giving up in the House.

 An NHS spokesperson said: “NHS staff are working round the clock to respond to the coronavirus outbreak, with 111 services dealing with over 120,000 more calls than the same week last year.
 “That’s why we’re already recruiting 500 additional initial call responders to answer up to 20,000 more 111 calls every day, with further staffing increases in train, providing a new online service which can provide advice at the touch of a button, and boosting the availability of clinical advice for those who need it.”
 Across England, NHS 111 services answered 340,702 calls in the week ending March 1 – over 22,000 more than the previous week, and over 51,000 more than the same week last year.

The Dutch investigators are convinced that these multiple attempts were unsuccessful, they said to the newspaper. Flight MH17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine on 17 July 2014.

 To the Editor:
 Please vote no on Exeter's warrant Article 4 for Design/Construction & Recreation Park Improvements!
 How can we vote to spend $10.8M to build a 25,000 square-feet recreation building, larger than any other town-owned building, when the real priority for our town's safety and security is to renovate or build essential updated facilities for our Police and Fire Departments?
 The Recreation Park expansion plan doesn't even include a new pool, adequate parking lot for expected usage, additional soccer field, and outside track which is all planned for in the next phase. This spending is out of control!
 Why are we not looking at the overall priorities for the town, as the Capital Improvement Program Report has attempted to do, and then put warrants up for a vote that align the greatest needs for our community?
 The Police and Fire Departments badly needed renovations and upgrades will surely cost a great deal of money, but those improvements provide for our future safety in the long term.
 How can we make the Recreation Department the priority, jeopardizing future Police and Fire Department improvements?
 Two of the five Select Board members firmly believe this project is out of scope for what a sustainable economically prudent building project should be and for good reason.
 The building plan is just that; if the town votes to move forward with this project, we have no idea what their final plan will look like!
 Other costs we know we're already slated to pay over the next five years include the general fund at $20M, water fund at $16.6M, sewer fund at $13M and capital improvements at $13M.
 Next year there will be a DPW garage warrant to fix snow load issues which may cost us $5 to $8M. In addition, our largest budgetary increase this year is a whopping 170% increase to pay for the $53M sewer treatment plant over the next 20 years. Additionally, the sewer main rehabilitation program will cost $4.5M over the next five years, along with many other road, utility, stormwater mitigation, dam reclassification for compliance, groundwater source development, well permitting and pump test, sludging of the lagoon, building a Hampton Road Booster Station. These projects are all important, and this is not the time to approve the expansion of the Recreation Park.
 We cannot afford to spend $10.8M on programming which benefits people from many other communities before looking at our own needs first!
 Not including what the fire and police renovations sorely need, the Fire Department will need $2.8M at a minimum for two ambulances, a new Engine 5 and Court Street Pump Station Upgrades. They need so much more!
 Please vote no for warrant Article 4 so that we can prioritize the Police and Fire Departments first!

The belief might easily arise that anyone now entering the spiritual world must unconditionally become a spiritual investigator himself. This is not necessarily so, although in my book, _Knowledge of the Higher Worlds_ , I have described much of how the soul must transform itself in order really to be able to enter. And to a certain degree, everyone is able to do this today, but it need not be everyone. What a person develops regarding the soul element is a purely intimate concern; what arises from it, however, is the formation of concepts of the investigated truths. What the spiritual investigator can give is clothed in conceptions such as I have developed today. Then it can be shared.

FORT MYERS, FLA -- It appears that Chris Sale's left elbow will not require Tommy John surgery, at least not now.
   
 Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic tweeted late Wednesday afternoon that a "source" told him that Sale "is not expected to undergo Tommy John surgery at this point."
   
 Kevin Gregg, vice president of communications for the Red Sox, said the team had nothing official to report.
   
 This latest report comes after two Tommy John surgery specialists looked at the results of an MRI on Sale's elbow this week.
   
 Red Sox doctors, who had the first look at the results, said they had sent the pictures to Dr. James Andrews, the go-to specialist for Tommy John surgery.
   
 Then, on Wednesday, the Sox said they were asking Dr. Neal Elattrache for his medical opinion on the condition of Sale's ulnar collateral ligament. Elattrache is an orthopedic surgeon at the Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles and is the Dodgers' team physician.
   
 What this means for Sale's future this spring remains unknown.
   
 Interim-manager Ron Roenicke explained to reporters Wednesday that "we need to get this right. We want as many opinions as we can."
   
 Tommy John surgery would end Sale's 2020 season and could affect part of the 2021 season as well.
   
 Sale missed the final six weeks of the 2019 season because of a sore elbow. This spring, he had said all along that his arm felt good. But after throwing just 15 pitches in live batting practice Sunday, he said he woke up Monday with pain in the elbow.
   
 And that's what set this crisis in motion.
   
 Sale's spring so far has been star-crossed. He came down with the flu and pneumonia just prior to the opening of camp in mid-February. Team officials asked him to stay home until he was cleared by a doctor, and when that finally happened, Sale was two weeks behind schedule.
   
 Roenicke said last week that because of the late start to camp, Sale would start the season on the injured list and work himself into regular-season shape at extended spring training in Fort Myers.
   
 On Tuesday, Boston's new chief baseball officer, Chaim Bloom said that, while the team is concerned, "we also know that in the course of building up, when you do hit these milestones, sometimes you can get sore."
   
 This is Sale's first year of his five-year, $145-million contract, which he had earned by being one of baseball's best pitchers when the Red Sox traded for him in a deal with the White Sox before the 2017 season.
   
 He was an All-Star seven straight seasons and led the American League in strikeouts twice. Even last season, despite shoulder and elbow problems, he struck out more than 200 batters. Sale will turn 31 on March 30.
   
 With 40% of Boston's starting rotation gone from last year -- David Price traded and Rick Porcello signing with the Mets -- for the Red Sox to compete in the A.L. East with the Yankees and Rays this year, Sale must be a workhorse.
   
 Eduardo Rodriguez, Nathan Eovaldi and Martin Perez are the only proven major- league starters currently on Boston's 40-man roster.

LORETTO, Pa. -- Keith Braxton scored 27 points and Randal Gaskins added 20 to pace Saint Francis (Pa.) past Bryant, 87-61, in the Northeast Conference quarterfinal Wednesday night.
   
 The Red Flash opened the game on a 22-4 run -- extending their lead to 22 points in the first half -- and led by at least 11 the rest of the way to oust the Bulldogs from the NEC tournament for the third time in four years.
   
 Bulldogs (15-17) senior Adam Grant scored 13 points and freshman Michael Green III added 12, but a fast start by Saint Francis (21-9) proved too much to overcome.
   
 A Grant 3-pointer got Bryant back within 12 at 36-24 with 4:33 to play in the half but the Bulldogs trailed, 45-31, at the break. Saint Francis then went on a 13-0 run in the second half to seal the victory.
   
 The Bulldogs shot 33.3% for the game while the Red Flash shot 57.1%. Hall Elisias grabbed a team-high seven rebounds, edging St. Francis, 38-37, on the glass. The Red Flash are 11-0 when holding opponents to 42.9% or worse from the field.
   
 Saint Francis, the NEC Tournament's No. 2 seed, has won its last six home games. The Red Flash will face No. 3 seed Sacred Heart in the semifinal round on Saturday.

BOSTON -- Ceremonies and a protest are marking the 250th anniversary Thursday of the massacre in Boston that helped spark the Revolutionary War.
 A morning tribute at the grave of the five victims of the fateful conflict included a wreath-laying ceremony and musket salute.
 The commemoration at the Old Granary Burial Ground in downtown Boston was the first of a number of events expected to take place across the country in the coming years to mark the 250th anniversary of America's war for independence, according to the Daughters of the American Revolution, which hosted the brief service.
 Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, the president of the Boston branch of the NAACP and others will also take part in an evening ceremony at the historic Old South Meeting House, also in downtown Boston near the massacre site.
 And other black and Native American groups planned a "death procession" protest from the massacre site to Faneuil Hall on Thursday afternoon.
 The protesters want to rename the historic meeting hall in honor of Crispus Attucks, a man of African American and Native American descent who was the first person killed in the massacre.
 Attucks is often cited as the first casualty of the American Revolution, and the hall, where prominent Bostonians debated independence from Britain, was infamously built by a wealthy merchant and slave trader.
 The groups are also calling for changing the state flag and seal, which depict a Native American man, a colonist's arm brandishing a sword and a Latin phrase that reads, in part, "By the sword we seek peace."
 The Boston Massacre took place on March 5, 1770, as a mob attacked a British soldier in front of the downtown Customs House on a snowy evening.
 The solider was among roughly 4,000 troops occupying Boston in order to enforce new tax laws imposed on the American colonies, according to the Daughters of the American Revolution.
 British soldiers opened fire on the crowd, killing Attucks and four other men: Samuel Gray, James Caldwell, Samuel Maverick and Patrick Carr.
 Two of the soldiers were eventually found guilty and branded. The victims were posthumously hailed as heroes, with thousands turning out for their funeral procession and their burial together.
 The story of the bloody street brawl, meanwhile, stoked anti-British sentiment throughout the colonies, thanks in large part to widely circulated engravings by Paul Revere depicting the British soldiers as the instigators of the conflict.
 John Adams, who defended the British soldiers in their trial and later became the new nation's second president, said the massacre was when the "foundation of American independence was laid."
 Four years later, irate Bostonians staged their infamous Tea Party, dumping British tea into the harbor to protest Colonial rule.
 The following year, in 1775, American and British armies clashed in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, during the first official battles of the Revolutionary War.

The three St. Martin Parish high schools — Breaux Bridge, Cecilia and St. Martinville — are like siblings when it comes to athletics.
 They want to beat each other as badly as anyone when they meet on the field, court or diamond.
 But when they don’t, they’re each other’s biggest fans.
 Perhaps only siblings are allowed to pick on each other.
 “If we weren’t playing and they were playing, we’d be at their game,” St. Martinville boys basketball coach Ihmaru Jones said of his parish brethren. “And vice versa.”
 So you can count Jones among those celebrating something believed to be a first in St. Martin Parish history — all three schools’ boys basketball programs have reached the quarterfinals at the same time.
 “I think it’s cool,” Cecilia coach Marty Lewis said. “We all compete against each other, but we all know each other and we talk. When we’re not playing each other, we wish each other good luck.”
 Two of three haven’t reached the quarterfinals since 2002, when Cecilia advanced to the third round of the Class 3A playoffs and St. Martinville won the Class 4A state championship.
 That was the last time the Bulldogs secured a quarterfinal berth, and they haven’t been to the semifinals since 1992. Prior to a run to the third round in 2018, St. Martinville hadn’t been past the second round since 2007.
 Much of Breaux Bridge’s success on the hardwood has all come in recent years under fifth-year coach Chad Pourciau, including last year’s Class 4A state championship. It was Breaux Bridge’s first trip to the LHSAA state tournament since 1972 and the program’s first title.
 “To have the whole parish in the Top 28, I think it would be great. I really do,” Pourciau said. “I think we all genuinely would like that for each other. As much as when we play each other we want to beat each other and win, at the end of the day, there’s no bad blood. We all like each other.”
 As the defending champions in Class 4A, Breaux Bridge’s return to the quarterfinals, where it will host No. 7 Salmen, is the least surprising. But the Tigers (26-8) had the unenviable task of traveling to Houma to play No. 18 A.J. Ellender in the second round after the Patriots beat No. 15 Tioga in the first round.
 “I think the toughest thing in the playoffs is going on the road in Round 2,” Pourciau said. “I think that’s where most of the upsets happen. We knew it would be a tough environment.”
 But Breaux Bridge proved it has been on this stage before, hitting its first five 3-pointers of the game and leading by as many as 21 points during the third quarter. When the Patriots whittled their deficit down to five points, Breaux Bridge leaned on its two bigs, Deandre Hypolite and Trevonte “Bébé” Sylvester, to get layups and pull away for a 68-57 win.
 Dalton Alexander and Kyser Patt combined to go 8 of 12 from the 3-point line. Alexander’s triple right after Ellender cut it five in the third quarter was perhaps the biggest of the game.
 “Last year’s experience 100 percent helped us get through the game,” Pourciau said. “You could just see it. … There was never a panic or a frustration level. You could tell our guys had been there before.”
 St. Martinville’s path to the quarterfinals has come in a different classification and with different coach than previous years. The No. 10 Tigers (27-8) dropped down to Class 3A, and Jones took over Darrel Mitchell Sr. after serving as his assistant for 15 years. Jones also has just one senior on the roster.
 SMSH set themselves up for top-10 seed in the playoffs by starting the year 13-1, but it had plenty of motivation to turn the page when the playoffs began. Crowley secured a season sweep of the Tigers in the regular season finale at SMSH, giving the Gents the District 6-3A title
 “District championship was one of our goals,” Jones said. “We had the last five possessions of the game and were down one and didn’t score when we played them at Crowley. Then losing that Senior Night-Winter Festival game at home was tough.
 “But after the game, they expected me to go into the locker room yelling and mad, but I told them they’re all juniors. We didn’t get this goal we needed, but it’s a new season. I know y’all are expecting me to come in here yelling, but all we’re doing is taking it as an experience. Remember this feeling. Make sure you don’t have this same feeling for the five games that we have to play to get to the state championship.”
 In the playoffs, the Tigers have put together two double-digit victories, including a 60-42 win at No. 7 Lutcher in the second round after being up by only one at halftime. SMSH will travel to No. 2 Wossman, last year’s 3A runner-up, on Friday.
 “If our guards shoot it well -- we have three guards on the floor that can control the tempo of the game -- we can beat anybody in the state,” Jones said.
 Cecilia’s run to the quarterfinals is the most unlikely on the St. Martin Parish trio. The Bulldogs (16-18) were given the No. 29 seed after losing 13 of their final 15 regular-season games, ending up on the wrong side of a handful of one- or two-possession contests.
 Now, after beating No. 4 Assumption on the road and the No. 13 Helen Cox at home, Cecilia is in the quarterfinals for the first time in 18 years. The Bulldogs will travel to No. 5 Woodlawn-Shreveport, the 4A runner-up in 2018, on Friday.
 “You can play a game hard and miss a free throw and you lose and you feel horrible, like you didn’t accomplish anything,” Cecilia coach Marty Lewis said. “Then you play the same way the next night, you make that free throw and you feel everything is hunky-dory. Everything is great. But you played the same way.
 “That’s kind of how I feel. I think we can play with anybody. We’re actually playing better than we have in the past. But the confidence now, getting these close wins underneath our belt, the guys are playing their best ball right now.”

PROVIDENCE -- After storming from behind in this crazy, exciting finish of a Big East season, the Friars now own a chance to make history.
   
 PC will carry an 11-6 record into the conference finale at the Dunk Saturday against DePaul. A win would be a sixth in a row, 8-of-10 overall and the 12th in conference play. That would set a new program record. The Friars have won 11 Big East games in three previous seasons.
   
 "I'm looking at number 11 but if we're fortunate [to win Saturday], I think that will be a magic number and an incredible come-from-behind from where we were on Dec. 17," coach Ed Cooley said. "If you told me on the 21st of December that we'd be sitting here right on the cusp of an NCAA bid, I would have told you you're nuts. But at the same time, I still see the fight and the passion from the group."
   
 The Friars struggled on the way to a 6-6 start before blowing out Texas in the final non-league game of the season. That put extreme pressure on the team to rally and post a strong Big East record, and doing so in what is one of the better seasons the conference has enjoyed in the last eight years made the task even harder. With the 80-74 win over Xavier Wednesday, the Friars now has achieved wins against every team in the Big East.
   
 Asked if his team has done enough to consider itself a certain NCAA Tournament team, Cooley said he just wants to keep winning.
   
 "I'm worried about DePaul and I'm not on the selection committee but I think we're making a great case for ourselves," Cooley said. "I really think we're making an incredible case for ourselves and, hopefully, we're fortunate when that selection comes out. We have a lot more work to do before we get to that point."
   
 What's become clear is that no one would like to see the red-hot Friars at the Big East Tournament in New York next week.
   
 "Coach Cooley has got them playing their best basketball at the right time of the year," said Xavier coach Travis Steele.
   
 White injures foot
   
 PC guard Maliek White was all smiles during media availability on Monday but injured his foot in practice, is now in a walking boot and is unavailable for the time being. White, who is day-to-day, was coming off one of the best three-game stretches of his career as he followed an 1- point effort at Georgetown with 10 points and four assists in a romp over Marquette and then a clutch 15 points in the 58-54 road win at Villanova.
   
 Without White coming off the bench as the team's sixth man, Cooley put some extra minutes on the legs of starting guards Luwane Pipkins (34 minutes) and David Duke (38), and a full 40 minutes on Alpha Diallo.
   
 Xavier also was dealing with missing a vital piece of its lineup. Paul Scruggs, the junior guard who averages 12.7 points, injured his hamstring in a practice and was unavailable for the Musketeers. His absence was felt in the ball-handling department as Xavier racked up five turnovers in the game's opening four minutes to fall behind, 10-2. The Musketeers dug themselves a big hole with 10 turnovers in the first half before they settled down.
   
 Dr. J in the Big East?
   
 Two Big East players, including Xavier's Naji Marshall, were named as finalists for the Julius Erving Small Forward of the year award sponsored by the Naismith Hall of Fame. Marshall was outstanding against the Friars with 25 points and he's joined as a finalist by Saddiq Bey of Villanova. The others are Corey Kispert (Gonzaga), Jordan Nwora (Louisville) and Precious Achiuwa (Memphis).
   
 Diallo was included on a watch list for the Erving award but did not make the cut this far.
   
 DePaul up next on Senior Night
   
 How competitive is the Big East? In the last week, ninth-place St. John's beat second-place Creighton by 20 points. Then last-place DePaul knocked off Markus Howard and Marquette, 69-68.
   
 The Blue Demons (3-14 Big East) will wrap up their regular season and try to avoid finishing in last place when they visit Providence Saturday night. The game is the final one at the Dunk for seniors Diallo, White, Kalif Young, Emmitt Holt and Luwane Pipkins.

A new trend shows more Americans want to die at home on their own terms surrounded by loved ones. The percentage of natural deaths at home is increasing, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, climbing from nearly 24% in 2003 to 30.7% in 2017. Natural deaths at hospice facilities also increased from .2 percent to 8 percent in that time period while natural deaths in hospitals and nursing facilities dropped.
 It's an understandable desire given clinical environments in our hospitals and normal human fears around dying. But making it happen is costly and not easy to achieve, especially for working families who may be asked to pay for round- the-clock care for their loved one.
 Last week, we asked New Englanders about their preferences around dying at home and if they think our health care system should support it. Not many of you answered, but the few who did spoke passionately about their experiences and opinions on the question. Read on for their responses and scroll below to answer this week's question on the coronavirus. Those that included their name are published below.
 This week's question looks at the U.S. response to the coronavirus, whether the right steps are being taken and how politics and economics might be playing a role. How happy are you with the U.S. response? What else do you think the government should be doing to keep Americans safe? Answer below or here. Responses will publish online on March 12.

 Is being able to die at home important to you? What are the benefits of providing terminal care in the home and how do we give individuals and families the support to do this?

 We just experienced this recently. My father was released to hospice care at home. The hospital was very good about contacting a hospice organization and having various medical equipment (hospital bed, oxygen, etc.) sent to the house. Hospice nurses will check in a couple of days a week. But because my dad needed 24 hour care we had to hire our own overnight and pt daily nurse, paid out of pocket. It was very stressful trying to figure out how long we'd be able to do this. On top of everything thing else going on, this was always in the back of our minds.
 The positives of our experience is that we found a way to make my father comfortable. Have conversations, make memories, discuss what his final wishes were and when he did finally pass, we were there, holding his hand.

 Being able to die at home is very important to me. Providing terminal care in the home helps to preserve the dignity of the individual. Often there is a measurable amount of fear that overtakes someone when they reach this point in their life. This is especially true when it is an unexpected illness. By staying within your own community and home some of this fear is eliminated. The sounds of the sick and broken are not wafting through the halls coupled with sterilizing chemical smells. Familiar surroundings, friends and loved ones can all help to dissuade some of those fears. By eliminating the stress of hospitalization the process can be less painful and could even prolong the individual's life a little as they enjoy their family. One program that is currently helping hundreds of Massachusetts residents stay home for their care is the Adult Foster Care program, or AFC. Preferred Residential Network out of Fall River is one provider of this service. MassHealth has been sponsoring this program and helping people get the health care they need but also made a way for those who wish to stay in their homes. Programs like this and Hospice programs can make passing away in your own home possible and possibly remove some of the overflow of hospital beds and the financial burden that goes along with keeping someone in the hospital until they pass. I would want to be home, in my own bed, with my family - not alone in a sterile environment, if possible.

 I want to die at home and have a home funeral for myself. Privacy and familiarity are the biggest reasons to provide terminal care at home. But cost and logistics make it nearly impossible. We need round the clock Medicare funded care options, not half an hour three days a week from a hospice nurse. We need to help family afford to do modifications to their home to accommodate wheelchair access or mechanical lift devices. Specially designed hospice homes are only offered to the more predictably terminally ill, usually young (not geriatric) cancer patients.
 My grandma has recently become wheelchair bound and while I am perfectly capable of caring for her and managing her medication, nutrition, social, and general well being I cannot be there to care for her 24/7/365. But it is cheaper to keep her in a skilled nursing facility than to hire part-time respite care for only 6 hours a day. That's not even enough time for me to go to work or to school. Her financial assets are too great for the state to pay for a caregiver, or to give me a stipend for quitting my job to care for her, but not great enough to afford the round the clock care for more than a couple months. Her wheelchair wouldn't even fit through her smaller-than-standard bedroom door at her assisted living facility apartment. Geriatric case manager guidance comes in at an average of $100/per hour. It is a better financial option for me to just take an unpaid day off from work and put in 6-7 hours of care coordinating, doctors office calling, and bill paying than to pay for someone else to do 40 minutes of googling and then 20 minutes of telling me what Google said. In this country, the way our healthcare is set up, only the rich can afford to die with dignity and comfort. In both dying and being dead. Grandmas preferred funeral home quoted me $9k for her funeral.. not including the casket, the church, the cemetery services, etc. She didn't want a home funeral and none of the places I talked to even supported them! Dying is for the rich. Period.

 I have been taking care of my mother since 2014 due to advanced dementia. Ahe promised me never to put her in a nursing home. Unfortunately I have had to spend all of my life savings just to continue paying for my home which I do not live in. mMy mother needs 24-hour care because she is totally dependent on me. It has cost over $1000000 since 2014. I spent countless hours every day trying to get some help from the system. Medicare has not been of any help since I have sent my Power of Attorney papers 3 times and they still state that they have not received any of the three power of attorney documents I sent to them in the past 3 years. I get no help from any other family members so I've had to rely on paying caregivers 12 hours a day and sometimes 24 hours a day just to get some sleep once or twice a week . I am truly disappointed that there are very few agencies that have the means to provide any kind of help that my mother needs therefore it relies on me alone to get the job done.

Hayley Williams has announced details of her first-ever solo tour.
 The Paramore vocalist will release her album _Petals For Armor_ on May 8 through Atlantic Records.
 She’ll hit the road beginning on May 13 in Amsterdam before wrapping up the Euro leg in Cologne on May 19. She’ll then play dates in the US and Canada from May 28.
 Williams says: “Wow. I am going on tour. Myself. It’s not Paramore and truthfully, it’s just a little terrifying. But if I know anything, it’s that there’s no safer place - besides at home with my dog - than to be in a room, on a stage, in front of the people who I’ve grown up singing my lungs out for.
 “There was a time I thought I wouldn’t tour _Petals For Armor_. What a joke. I must. This is a brand new adventure. It’s important to embark on something new every now and then just to show yourself that you can. I welcome the discomfort and the joy and I’m ready to be present for this.

OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) — A bill to provide electronic monitoring and real-time victim notification is close to becoming state law, three months after a Vancouver woman was killed by her estranged husband. The Washington House on Wednesday unanimously approved Senate Bill 5149, named “The Tiffany Hill Act,” The Columbian reported. The former Marine sergeant was shot and killed Nov. 26 in her minivan outside Sarah J. Anderson Elementary School. Hill’s husband had been arrested in September for domestic violence. He was free on bail and blocked by court order from having any contact with Hill when he shot his wife and mother-in-law, who survived her injuries, in front of the couple’s three children. He killed himself following a short police chase. This is the third year Sen. Lynda Wilson, R-Vancouver, has sponsored the bill. “The concept is simple,” Wilson said in a statement after Wednesday’s vote. “When the abuser or stalker gets closer than the court allows, you get an alert on your phone. Tiffany Hill’s story makes it even easier to understand how this could benefit any number of the thousands of people who obtain restraining orders each year.” The Senate unanimously approved the measure in late January. The legislation will next go back to the Senate for its concurrence after a minor amendment was made on the House floor to provide greater specificity for when a victim would receive notification. That formality should be completed before the 2020 session adjourns March 12. The legislation then will be forwarded to Gov. Jay Inslee for his signature.

Given the rash of comments in the media and on Facebook calling for the government to end the blockade by force, it’s time that we took a step back to understand our own history and observe how the past continues to inform our current attitudes towards Indigenous people. These three books scratch the surface concerning the history of Indigenous struggles in Canada, but for those who dare to know, they will give you a basis for empathy and understanding and who knows, maybe you too will find yourself observing things from a very different perspective. The government of Justin Trudeau promised to take reconciliation seriously, but if he will not then it’s up to us as Canadians and it starts with each of us shedding our sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity regarding our historical relationship to Indigenous people. It starts with each of us examining the good, the bad, and the ugly of our own country, and then doing something about it.
