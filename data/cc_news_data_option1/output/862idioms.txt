Closing warming shelter now is wrong
 I read in The Norman Transcript [Feb. 25] that the City of Norman is closing down the warming shelter for the homeless population to use on Feb. 29 — so that they can start remodeling the old library for city office space. This seems incredibly cruel to me; it is still getting very, very cold at night!
 I ride the bus, and every single time I ride it, I see more-and-more new homeless people. It’s quite apparent to me that the homeless population in Norman is growing by leaps and bounds. I am especially shocked by the numbers of homeless women that I am seeing.

The contrast of President and Candidate Trump is interesting. He's always been confident and a bit over the top, but he slaps that podium this time around and not without good reason. The President has an outstanding record to seek re-election, and has set the tone for what he would do when he was a candidate. Senator Tillis' remarks were an excellent summation of Mr. Trump's first term. Given a second term, 'The Best is yet to come' might turn out to be a bit of an understatement as far as the President's future success.

Pete Buttigieg endorsed Joe Biden's presidential candidacy on Monday in a meeting between the two former rivals on the eve of crucial Super Tuesday voting as moderate Democrats rallied around the former vice president to strengthen his challenge to front-runner Bernie Sanders. “I'm delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden," Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who ended his candidacy on Sunday, said at their appearance outside a Dallas restaurant. “He is somebody of such extraordinary grace and kindness and empathy.”
 Biden, 77, in turn, told reporters that Buttigieg, 38, "reminds me of my son Beau," who died in 2015, "To me, it is the highest complement you can give any man or woman.” Later on Monday, Biden was also set to receive the endorsement of Senator Amy Klobuchar at a Dallas rally when she announces the suspension of her presidential campaign, a Klobuchar aide said.
 Former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, another former candidate for the Democratic nomination, was also expected to endorse Biden, the New York Times reported. Biden is fresh off a resounding victory in Saturday's South Carolina primary and is aiming for a strong showing on Super Tuesday against Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, who many centrist Democrats fear cannot win against Republican President Donald Trump in November.
 But Biden still faces a challenge from billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg among voters hoping the party will nominate a moderate to face Trump. Bloomberg, a late entrant to the race, will make his ballot-box debut when 14 states vote on Super Tuesday. He is betting the $500 million of his own money he has poured into his campaign will allow him to make up for not competing in the first nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
 He said on Monday the most likely scenario was that no Democratic candidate would win a majority of delegates and that picking the nominee could come down to "horse trading" at the Democratic convention in Milwaukee in July. Asked at a Fox News town hall if a contested convention lay in his path to the nomination, Bloomberg said: "That is the way that it would work I would guess."
 The Super Tuesday contests offer the biggest one-day haul of the 1,991 delegates needed to win the party's nomination at its national convention in July, with about 1,357 delegates, or nearly one-third of the total number, up for grabs. Fourteen states - California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Vermont, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina and Maine \- as well as American Samoa and Democrats living abroad cast ballots on Tuesday. (The primary for expatriate Americans is scheduled to run through March 10.)
 Five candidates - Biden, Bloomberg, Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \- remain in the running for the Democratic nomination, down from more than 20 earlier in the campaign. Bloomberg and Biden have emerged as the main contenders for the votes of moderate Democrats, while Sanders, a senator from Vermont, is the progressive front-runner nationally, eclipsing Warren.
 BIDEN'S MOMENTUM Biden's high-stakes triumph in South Carolina, where his campaign had said his popularity with black voters would propel him to victory after early disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, helped winnow the field.
 Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer also gave up his campaign on Saturday night after a third-place finish in the Southern state in which he had invested most heavily. Sanders' momentum might not be easily slowed. On Monday, his campaign downplayed the efforts by moderates to present a united front.
 "The establishment is nervous, not because we can't beat Trump, but because we will," said Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir. "And when we do, the Democratic Party will again be a party of the working class." It was not immediately clear who would immediately benefit from the departures of Buttigieg and Klobuchar. A Morning Consult poll taken Feb. 23 to 27, for example, before Buttigieg exited the race, showed that 21% of his supporters named Sanders as their second choice, 19% picked Biden, another 19% chose Warren and 17% favored Bloomberg.
 Biden still lags his rivals in spending and organization in Super Tuesday states and beyond, but his campaign said on Sunday it had raised more than $10 million over the preceding two days. Endorsements of the former vice president from elected officials and community leaders poured in on Monday.
 Backing from Ohio Democrats including Representative Marcia Fudge and former Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory added to endorsements from Senator Tim Kaine and state House of Delegates Majority Leader Charniele Herring of Virginia. In Colorado, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock has backed Biden. In California, Representative Gil Cisneros is supporting the former vice president.

BOISE — A bill to loosen up Idaho's mandatory minimum prison sentences for heroin while adding new mandatory minimums for fentanyl passed the Idaho House on a divided vote Monday, amid debate over whether it's a step toward sentencing reform or just creates more mandatory minimum sentences.
 Current Idaho law defines possession of certain amounts of specific drugs as "trafficking," whether or not the offender was trying to sell the drugs; drug trafficking offenses carry mandatory prison terms. Much of the debate has focused on heroin addicts who've gone to prison on trafficking charges.
 HB 469, which passed the House on a 40-29 vote, raises the amounts of heroin that trigger those mandatory minimums. But it also adds new mandatory minimums for fentanyl possession.
 "This bill is worse than nothing," said House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise. "I think there will be a net increase in the number of people incarcerated on mandatory minimum sentences under this bill. … That’s the concern."
 The bill falls short of what a majority of House members want, and have voted for the past two years: To give judges more discretion, rather than tie them to mandatory minimum sentences pegged solely to amounts of drugs possessed.
 Bills to allow judges to vary from the mandatory minimums in certain cases passed the House in 2018 and 2019 but have never gotten a hearing in the Senate.
 Supporters of the bill, which is being sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Greg Chaney, R-Caldwell, said it would at least address the problem of heroin addicts with high tolerances facing mandatory minimum sentences for possession of personal use amounts. Chaney recalled the testimony he has heard in committee for the past three years from addicts who ended up in prison, and said if the bill doesn't pass, they would continue to.
 "Anecdote after anecdote, the examples given were for those caught with heroin," Chaney said. "This addresses the lion's share of those situations."
 Rep. Bryan Zollinger, R-Idaho Falls, called the bill a "Hobson's choice," saying it would make some things better as far as heroin sentences but could reduce the chances of something more comprehensive passing in the future.

The Benton Parks and Recreation Department will partner with AAROC's Autism Alliance of Saline County for an Adaptive Dance Luau from 6 to 8 p.m. March 28.


  "Adaptive Dance is a dance for sensory friendly kids," said Grant Watts, special events coordinator, adding the lights will be on and the music will be low.


  Watts said it is important to offer children with sensory processing issues the same types of programs that Parks offers other children.


  Local disc jockey DJ Raquel will provide the music. There will be a photo booth and light refreshments. The snacks will include gluten free options.


  Watts said the department has been working to expand adaptive offerings. He wants to create space for everyone to participate.


  While the event is free, participants need to register at the River Center lobby, by calling 501-776-5970 or online at www.bentonar.org/departments/parksrec. Space is limited.


  Parents can register themselves and a child plus an additional sibling or friend.


  Watts said the event is not only for those with autism, but anyone with sensory processing disorders and their siblings are welcome to attend.


  The Parks Department has partnered with the Autism Alliance before for a movie, and Watts plans to hold another sensory movie with the Alliance in the future.


  Those who plan to attend are encouraged to dress in Hawaiian and beach attire. Parks will have leis and grass skirts for people to wear.


  Watts wants everyone who attends to be able to have a great time at the event.


  "Our department is very thankful for AAROC and our partnership with them, and we are excited to host this event with them," said Parks Director Stephanie Jones.


  Watts is thankful for the staff and volunteers who make events like Adaptive Dance possible. He also appreciates the community and residents who he said they couldn't hold events without.


  "We are excited to add this adaptive program to our schedule," Watts said.

When a town in New Hampshire assesses and collects property taxes to fund an approved budget, but portions of the expenditures set forth in the budget are not actually spent during the budget year, the resulting “leftover” tax money is referred to euphemistically as the budget “surplus,” as if it was magically created by the elites who actually run the town or city.


  But most people know that government does not actually produce or manufacture anything of material value — other than, perhaps, loads of paper and hot air.


  It would probably be very inconvenient if such leftover money or “surplus” was rolled over into the next year to reduce the taxes that need to be collected in that year. But that would be too easy and logical. Everyone loves a slush fund — except those who are paying for it.


  So we end up with a situation in which town warrant articles seeking approval of the voters for expenditures outside of the ordinary operating budget are often described in the articles as “this sum to come from surplus fund balance and no amount to be raised from taxation.”


  What a bunch of nonsense! This is the worst kind of fraud — fraud perpetrated by those we elect to provide good stewardship over our tax monies.

The Trump administration said on Monday it had secured commitments from top pharmaceutical companies to work together to develop a vaccine and treatments to fight the coronavirus.At a meeting with industry executives at the White House, President Donald Trump exhorted the companies to collaborate to speed the process of getting a vaccine and therapeutics to victims of the virus. The company leaders indicated a willingness to cooperate with one another, but did not lay out how that would happen.The White House, which has clashed previously with the pharmaceutical industry over high drug prices and has been struggling in recent weeks to show it is on top of the virus response, saw the meeting as a victory. This is all hands on deck. And the news out of this meeting that youve already formed a consortia ... now we know they will be working together to create therapeutics and ultimately a new vaccine, Vice President Mike Pence said as the session drew to a close.The global death toll from the illness caused by the new coronavirus now exceeds 3,000, with more than 60 countries affected. In the United States, there have been more than 90 cases, with six deaths. Trump pressed the representatives at the table about their timeframes for getting a vaccine ready and took upbeat comments from some of the company leaders to mean that it could be ready to deploy within months.You seem to know what the answer is to this, Trump said. Get it done. We need it. Pressed on whether the vaccine would be ready in the short timeframe he desired, Trump said he had heard from the leaders at the table a range of three to four months to a year. But Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, stepped in and urged those at the table to correct the presidents impression.Hes asking the question When is it going to be deployable And that is going to be at the earliest a year to a year and a half, Fauci said. Trump, who has sought to suggest a vaccine would be ready before health professionals have indicated, followed up after Faucis comments You think thats rightAttendees assured him that treatments, rather than a vaccine itself, could be ready before that. Attendees included the chief executives of Gilead Sciences Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, Moderna Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc as well as research and development executives from Pfizer Inc, Johnson Johnson and Sanofi SA, all of which are working on vaccines or treatments for the virus.Even with Trump voicing hope that the companies can accelerate their development as much as possible, executives and other experts have suggested that clinical trials to guarantee a vaccine is safe and effective could mean that it could take a minimum of 12 to 18 months to hit the market. Antiviral treatments could possibly move faster toward approval.Pfizers chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, told Trump the company had identified compounds that had a high probability of being effective against the virus. After the meeting, Pfizer said in a statement it had identified some antiviral compounds it owns as potential treatments for coronaviruses and was working with a third party to evaluate them.It said if they proved to be good candidates and passed toxicology studies, it hoped to start testing them clinically by the end of the year.

Starting today, aspiring candidates may apply. The last date to submit the application form is March 31. Final astronaut candidates are expected to be selected in mid-2021 to begin training as the next class of Artemis Generation astronauts, NASA said in a press release on Monday.Upon successful completion of the training, the new astronauts could launch on American rockets and spacecraft, developed for NASAs Commercial Crew Program or on the agencys powerful new Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft to live and work aboard the International Space Station.Becoming an astronaut is no easy task, because being an astronaut is no easy task. Those who apply will likely be competing against thousands who have dreamed of and worked toward going to space for as long as they can remember. But somewhere among those applicants are our next astronauts, and we look forward to meeting you.Steve Koerner, NASAs director of flight operations and chair of the Astronaut Selection Board at NASAs Johnson Space CenterApplication requirements Applicants must haveUnited States citizenship and a masters degree in a STEM field from an accredited institutionAt least two years of related, progressively responsible professional experience or at least 1,000 hours of pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft.Must pass the NASA long-duration spaceflight physical.For the first time, applicants will have to undergo a two hour online assessment. Seeking to explore more of the lunar surface, the agency is currently preparing for the launch of Artemis, a program to return astronauts the first woman, and next man to the lunar surface by 2024.

The growing demand for agricultural products on the back of rising population rates and per capita consumption has presented potential avenues for the use of novel agricultural techniques such as foliar fertilization. According to analysis carried out by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, kilocalorie demand per person is likely to reach 3050 kcal. In addition to this, global population is expected to touch 8.3 billion by 2030. Momentous growth in population is expected to increase the demand for agricultural commodities, in turn, creating an urgency to enhance the agricultural produce using nutrition enhancement with foliar fertilizer. This is likely to spur the demand for foliar fertilization, consequently pushing the sales of foliar fertilizer.

 Voters without ID, or whose names are not found in the Precinct Registry, or voters who disagree with the information shown in the Registry, may always cast a provisional ballot. A provisional ballot is sealed in a special envelope and counted after Election Day if the voter’s information can be verified by the County Election Board.
 Anyone who needs to look up their polling place, verify their registration information, or view a sample ballot can do so online. The OK Voter Portal can be accessed on the Oklahoma State Election Board's website: www.elections.ok.gov or through www.clevelandcountyelectionboard.com.

This is the latest in a series of liquor modernization proposals Oklahoma voters have determined at the ballot box. In 2016, Oklahomans passed a measure that allowed wine and high point beer to be sold in convenience and grocery stores. In addition, liquor stores were allowed to sell cold beer and liquor accessories such as ice and corkscrews. Oklahomans approved the liquor modernization state question with 65% of the total votes cast.
 If approved, this proposal will do more for liquor store owners than any previous measure, according to Lisette Barnes, president of the Oklahoma Beer Alliance.
 "It will provide equity and parity for the small business owner that they're not getting right now," she said. "I hope people get out and say yes."
 If the proposal is rejected, supporters would have to wait another two years before the measure could be placed on the ballot, according to state law.
 "This gives consumers the chance to get their favorite beer or wine at their favorite liquor store any day of the week. It's a matter of fairness," Barnes said.
 Barnes believes the proposal will pass based on the large number of people expected to cast votes because of the presidential election and the favorable weather forecast.
 "There are few businesses that have these type of blue laws," Barnes said. "Liquor store owners are looking at their competitors being open and they can't."
 Jennifer Blackburn, owner of Cellar Wine and Spirits in Norman, said she favors the proposition so her customers can buy their favorite products any time they wish, including Sundays in preparation for professional football games.
 "I don't know if it will increase revenue or not, maybe a little and that would be fantastic," she said. "It won't increase the number of drinkers but it will be a convenience for our customers who need something on Sundays. If our customers want to buy something on Sundays, we should be able to sell it to them."
 Like Barnes, Blackburn is optimistic the measure will pass based on customer reactions posted on the store's Facebook and Instagram pages.

“This is the loudest our crowd has been all season,” Wildwood standout Diante Miles said. “We had to bring the energy for them.”
 Miles scored 29 points and Seamus Fynes 18 for Wildwood, which ended the game on a 16-3 run.
 Dylan Delvecchio scored 22 for Cape May Tech.
 Fans filled Wildwood’s gym to watch these Cape May County rivals meet. The Wildwood student section chanted “Defense! Defense!” from the opening tip. In the fourth quarter, fans reacted with each made basket and missed shot.
 “That gets us pumped up,” Miles said of the atmosphere. “That motivates us to keep pushing forward.”
 Both teams pushed the pace. Both teams made some high-risk, ill-advised passes.
 Sixth-seeded Wildwood (19-8) took control with a 13-1 run that turned a one- point lead late in the first quarter into a 24-11 advantage with 6 minutes, 38 seconds left in the second.
 That stretch began with Omarian McNeal’s unconventional dunk. The ball hit the back of the rim, bounced into the air and fell through the hoop. McNeal was also fouled and sank the free throw.
 Fynes made two 3-pointers during the run, and Miles scored on a pair of fast- break layups, one after a steal.

China can backstop its naval presence with not only advanced land-based airpower but especially with its array of anti-ship and land-attack cruise and ballistic missiles. Two land-based, road-mobile anti-ship ballistic missiles pose a direct threat to U.S. Navy combatants. The DF-21D has a range of more than 1,000 miles and is the first ASBM designed to hit ships at sea. The DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile boasts a range of about 2,500 miles, and it can carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead. Both missiles can achieve much greater range if delivered by air on the PLA's new H-6N bomber, which is also designed to carry supersonic cruise missiles and UAVs, among other weapons. As if to emphasize the psychological warfare element of Beijing's total competition, these missiles are often referred to as the "carrier-killer" and "Guam express" weapons designed to push the U.S. military out beyond the second island chain. Meanwhile, China is reportedly developing hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) that would be much harder to intercept.

Are the squirrels in your yard running around crazy like they are possessed? Are you seeing more coyotes wandering through the neighborhood? Are you hearing more bird calls? Well, it's that time of the year. Love is in the air, and all wildlife has only one thing on their mind. This is the time of year for mating for most wildlife species. They are making themselves louder, prettier and generally more visible all in an attempt to attract a mate and reproduce.
 Each species has a different mating ritual. For most songbirds, the male establishes a territory and then courts a female. They build or find the nest together, and then they mate. They both incubate the eggs, feed each other and their nestlings, and then see the fledglings off together. This is known as breeding cycle monogamy. When the fledglings leave, this completes the breeding cycle. At this time, they are free to stay together and produce another brood, or they might seek other mates and start the cycle again. Even though this couple is "socially monogamous," it is common for them both to mate elsewhere and for the females to add fertilized eggs from another male to the eggs she tends to with her steady partner.
 Bats live in large colonies that are predominantly female. This makes it easy for a male bat to find a mating partner. In mating season, bats mate night and day with many partners. Males and females live in different colonies until they are ready to mate, and then the male initiates contact. During the day, the male will rub his head against the female to start the process. Then at night,he will awaken the female by biting her on the neck and then proceed. Female bats are able to delay implantation of the egg by storing the sperm in the reproductive tract if there is a shortage of nutrition. Female bats can birth up to three healthy litters, one pup at a time during breeding season. After mating, the males bats go hang out somewhere until they are again needed.
 Opossums have a breeding season that can last most of the year. Opossums are marsupials. They have a reproductive system that is split completely. resulting in two separate birth canals and two uteri. They also have a fur- lined pouch on the outside of their bodies in which they shelter and nurse their young. Female opossums can have up to seven fertility cycles a year, provided pregnancy doesn't occur. They will birth two litters per year. Males continue to mate with females throughout the breeding season. A female will birth between 10-20 infants two weeks after fertility. They are about the size of a honeybee and will then crawl up the mother's body into the pouch, where they will attach to a teat. Only approximately half survive, and the mother only has 13 teats. They continue to live here on the teat for two months . They then begin to venture outside. When they are too large for the pouch, they spend time on their mothers back for about three more months. The hidden babies are the reason it is important to check a dead opossum's pouch. If you see babies, bring the mother and all babies to a rehabilitation center immediately. Do not remove the babies.
 Raccoons can mate anytime between January and June. Most females begin reproducing around one year of age. She has a 65-day gestation period and births between two and five kits, most usually in the spring. She separates herself from other raccoons to raise her kits alone without the help of the male. They stay in their den until they are 8-10 weeks old, but will stay with their mother until 13-14 months of age. It is a close family unit.
 Squirrels generally mate twice a year, although we have seen late third litters at our center. They mate once in summertime and once toward the end of wintertime. When the female is ready to mate, the chasing begins, often by multiple males who compete for her. They carry their pregnancies from 25-44 days, depending on the species of squirrel. On Cape Cod, our most common squirrel is the Eastern Grey Squirrel with a gestation period of 44 days. Squirrels can give birth to one to 10 babies, called kittens. The mother will store food supplies to use during the period she is in the nest. She is extremely protective of a nest and will be aggressive toward anyone coming near it. Babies generally leave the nest around 12 weeks. Most squirrels continue to live within a relatively short distance from the place they were born.
 Red foxes and Gray foxes are the two types of foxes we see in southeastern Massachusetts. They breed once a year, between December and March. Red foxes have multiple mates, while Gray foxes remain with their partner for life. For both, once the male and female begin the courting process, they bond by traveling together for three weeks. They hunt together and find a suitable den. Courting involves a lot of loud barking and screams. After the pair have mated, the gestation period is 52 days. Once the pups are born, usually 3-9 per litter, the mother stays in the den to attend to the pups. Fox fathers have been described as indulgent and attentive, playing with their pups endlessly. They provide food the for mother and the pups until she can leave the den. Pups get weaned about one month. As the pups get older, the father educates the pups about hunting, usually about 3 months of age. He will bury food near the den so they can learn to sniff and forage. The pups go out on their own at about 7 months of age.
 This limited selection speaks to the similarities and differences of only some of the species of animals. The universal message seems to be that all animals reproduce, care for and love their young with the goal to raise them to maturity, so they can start their own families. Just like us.

It only comes in black and white now, but they'll make it soon in color…I felt so old and out of it with this young whiz guy right there who helped invent it."

This is the main factor that is responsible for the growth of the speech analytics market and a protuberant driving factor in the growing demands for speech analytics in several industrial applications. This rising demand can also be accredited to the burdens on businesses for safeguarding their rational assets for improving agility and competence in business operations via the all-embracing insights quarried in the Voice of Customer (VoC).

  Jackson’s top priority for the district is economic development, particularly in the less populous and more rural parts of the region that haven’t seen the massive population and industry growth as in other parts of the state. District 27 spans all or some of 13 counties in South Texas.


  De La Fuente did not appear to campaign in Texas, although he listed a Victoria address on his application to be on the ballot. While on the ballot in Texas, De La Fuente was also listed as a Democratic candidate for California’s 21st District, which includes parts of Fresno and Kern counties.


  The winner of Tuesday’s primary will challenge U.S. Rep. Michael Cloud, the Republican incumbent, in the November general election.

It's the moment months of campaigning has been leading up to -- Super Tuesday.
 Super Tuesday -- on March 3 -- is likely the most important day on the primary calendar for Democratic hopefuls. It's when voters from 14 states will have their say, representing the largest single-day voting event during the primaries and a make-or-break moment for most of the candidates.
 To put it in perspective, the primaries are all about winning delegates -- think of it like the electoral college. There's a total of 3,979 delegates that will be awarded during the primary, and the candidate that makes it onto the ballot to run against the highly-likely Republican nominee President Donald Trump will need at least 1,991 delegates to support them. Each state is allotted a certain number of delegates.
 SIGN UP FOR THE INSIDE MASSACHUSETTS POLITICS NEWSLETTER.
 Despite all the hype for the early primaries -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- those states in total make up a tiny fraction of the delegates -- 155 or 4 percent. The Super Tuesday voting, in contrast, is 1,357 delegates, or about a third of the overall delegates.
 In a race that still seems largely undecided, the results of Super Tuesday are anticipated to bring the race into focus. It's a key moment for front-runner Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is facing significant competition from former Vice President Joe Biden, who is surging and expected to gain momentum as fellow moderates, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, have dropped out of the race.
 It will also determine the viability of the campaigns of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.
 So who's voting? California, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Maine and Vermont are all voting. There are both Democratic and Republican primaries in every state, but the focus is on the Democrats, as Trump is polling in the high 80s and low 90 compared to his little-talked-about challenger Bill Weld, who is in the single digits.
 It's a popular time for states to hold their primary, as many states feel going early in the process gives their state more weight. Notably, California moved its primary up this year to be part of Super Tuesday.
 The number of states voting also means it brings the most diverse set of voters to the voting booths, better reflecting the country's demographics. Pundits often talk about it as a chance to get a better look at how candidates will perform on a national level. Here's a breakdown on what to look for in every state.
 However, it's also important to note it's not the end of the primaries. Even if a candidate swept every state on Tuesday - which is extremely unlikely - it's still not enough to guarantee their spot on the ballot. The primaries will continue through June, and there's still time for candidates to sway voters.
 The Democratic National Convention, where the candidate will be finalized, is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from July 13-16. There, delegates will pick and send a candidate to the ballot in November.

GREAT FALLS – Monday marked the beginning of Spring Break for Carroll College students in Helena, and while it's a good time to relax from schoolwork, a small group is taking that time to volunteer in the Electric City with a bit of heavy lifting.


  With some help from construction managers, the students are working with non- profit Habitat for Humanity, lifting pieces, tools and placing screws in their efforts to build the foundation for a three bed, one bathroom home.


  For the group, the volunteer work isn't just a chance to serve the community, it's also an opportunity to learn.


  "Not all of us know how to use the equipment, so [Habitat for Humanity is] teaching us how to work and the next five days will probably go a lot smoother,” said Todd Pays, a Carroll College Alumnus and one of the volunteers on board.


  Pays said it's too early to tell how much progress they'll make by the end of the week, but he hopes that they will get to the house's indoor walls before they head back to the capitol.

Pete Buttigieg endorsed Joe Bidens presidential candidacy on Monday in a meeting between the two former rivals on the eve of crucial Super Tuesday voting as moderate Democrats rallied around the former vice president to strengthen his challenge to front-runner Bernie Sanders. Im delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden, Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who ended his candidacy on Sunday, said at their appearance outside a Dallas restaurant. He is somebody of such extraordinary grace and kindness and empathy.Biden, 77, in turn, told reporters that Buttigieg, 38, reminds me of my son Beau, who died in 2015, To me, it is the highest complement you can give any man or woman. Later on Monday, Biden was also set to receive the endorsement of Senator Amy Klobuchar at a Dallas rally when she announces the suspension of her presidential campaign, a Klobuchar aide said.Former U.S. Representative Beto ORourke, another former candidate for the Democratic nomination, was also expected to endorse Biden, the New York Times reported. Biden is fresh off a resounding victory in Saturdays South Carolina primary and is aiming for a strong showing on Super Tuesday against Sanders, a self- described democratic socialist, who many centrist Democrats fear cannot win against Republican President Donald Trump in November.But Biden still faces a challenge from billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg among voters hoping the party will nominate a moderate to face Trump. Bloomberg, a late entrant to the race, will make his ballot-box debut when 14 states vote on Super Tuesday. He is betting the 500 million of his own money he has poured into his campaign will allow him to make up for not competing in the first nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.He said on Monday the most likely scenario was that no Democratic candidate would win a majority of delegates and that picking the nominee could come down to horse trading at the Democratic convention in Milwaukee in July. Asked at a Fox News town hall if a contested convention lay in his path to the nomination, Bloomberg said That is the way that it would work I would guess.The Super Tuesday contests offer the biggest one-day haul of the 1,991 delegates needed to win the partys nomination at its national convention in July, with about 1,357 delegates, or nearly one-third of the total number, up for grabs. Fourteen states - California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Vermont, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina and Maine - as well as American Samoa and Democrats living abroad cast ballots on Tuesday. The primary for expatriate Americans is scheduled to run through March 10.Five candidates - Biden, Bloomberg, Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii - remain in the running for the Democratic nomination, down from more than 20 earlier in the campaign. Bloomberg and Biden have emerged as the main contenders for the votes of moderate Democrats, while Sanders, a senator from Vermont, is the progressive front-runner nationally, eclipsing Warren.BIDENS MOMENTUM Bidens high-stakes triumph in South Carolina, where his campaign had said his popularity with black voters would propel him to victory after early disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, helped winnow the field.Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer also gave up his campaign on Saturday night after a third-place finish in the Southern state in which he had invested most heavily. Sanders momentum might not be easily slowed. On Monday, his campaign downplayed the efforts by moderates to present a united front.The establishment is nervous, not because we cant beat Trump, but because we will, said Sanders campaign manager, Faiz Shakir. And when we do, the Democratic Party will again be a party of the working class. It was not immediately clear who would immediately benefit from the departures of Buttigieg and Klobuchar. A Morning Consult poll taken Feb. 23 to 27, for example, before Buttigieg exited the race, showed that 21 of his supporters named Sanders as their second choice, 19 picked Biden, another 19 chose Warren and 17 favored Bloomberg.Biden still lags his rivals in spending and organization in Super Tuesday states and beyond, but his campaign said on Sunday it had raised more than 10 million over the preceding two days. Endorsements of the former vice president from elected officials and community leaders poured in on Monday.Backing from Ohio Democrats including Representative Marcia Fudge and former Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory added to endorsements from Senator Tim Kaine and state House of Delegates Majority Leader Charniele Herring of Virginia. In Colorado, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock has backed Biden. In California, Representative Gil Cisneros is supporting the former vice president.

Beverly also earned a pair of North Division all-stars in guards Damian Bouras and Justin DeLaCruz.
