Only 31.9% of Paycheck Protection Program funding went to businesses whose loans were less than $350,000.
 "That was the loophole, and it's a hell of a loophole that these corporations took advantage of," said JJ Steelman, co-owner of Dad's Donuts and the Boys Brew.
 Dad's Donuts and the Boys Brew applied for the Paycheck Protection Program to ensure their employees, all of whom are family, were able to make ends meet. They received a call from their credit union Thursday saying that the program funds had been depleted and that they would not be receiving funding.
 At that time, Steelman reached out to the community on Facebook, who showed up in hordes to help keep their business afloat. After making enough to bolster their operation, they were notified that they would, in fact, be receiving those federal funds.
 Although Steelman didn't know the logic behind how the funds became available, he said they'll accept all the help they can get.
 Freedom's Edge Brewing Company was another small business that received funding from the program, which was a much-needed boost, according to Muriah Kilmer.
 Having to shift their entire business operation to comply with health orders, Freedom's Edge had to buy a canning machine to be able to sell its beer. Refilling growlers wasn't an option due to health concerns, so the brewery had to adjust.
 "It's been kind of a lifesaver as far as business goes, but it's not quite enough," Kilmer said. "It was really important for us to keep everybody on staff, and this is where the PPP has come in and been a saving grace for us."
 For any local businesses that wanted Paycheck Protection Program funding but weren't able to get it, Lea from the SBA recommends getting and staying in touch with your banker. You can make sure they have all the information they need for your application in case more funding becomes available.
 And for help coming up with a plan of action, businesses can reach out to the University of Wyoming's Small Business Development Center Network at www.wyomingsbdc.org.

The times are such that not so long ago I used a random number generator to simulate the 2020 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament that never was and posted the results to Twitter.
 In an outcome that left me marbled with contempt, Duke prevailed. There's nothing novel about detesting Duke basketball, but I can claim a long grip on such righteousness. In the 1986 final between Louisville and Duke, Danny Ferry marked his team's defeat by clothes-lining Louisville's Jeff Hall as the clock ran out. For me, the serialized run of Duke heels that is still too much with us began at that moment some 34 years ago. So while it's not interesting that I loathe Duke basketball, I am if nothing else tenured at the rituals of it. Should the Blue Devils honor me at some future halftime for being their most veteran hater? Probably, but they shall always be strangers to decency.
 Anyhow, in this pretend tournament, the latest episode of Duke villainy came when they defeated top seed Dayton -- those plucky topplers of assumptions -- in the Final Four. Seeing a lamentable blueblood take down a mid-major enjoying a once-in-a-century season and deprive them of a spot in the title game reduced me to a toddler in high dudgeon. So in my imagination, I replaced Dayton head coach Anthony Grant at the podium for the post-game presser.
 _"What impressed you about what Duke did from a scheme standpoint tonight?"_
 "What impressed me about Duke was the talent, doggedness, and intelligence on the floor. Nothing they did tactically from the bench was the least bit surprising. In fact, they could've beaten us even worse if they'd made some better rotation decisions in the first half and stopped trying to screw around with a zone. If you're trying to get to me to compliment the guy who coaches Duke, then I guess I can accommodate by saying he's good at hiring assistants who recruit well."
 _"But in terms of--"_
 "If you look at the talent he's run through that place over the last few years, it's remarkable that he hasn't managed to win a title in a while. Has any coach over the last half decade or so done less with more than the guy Duke employs? That's rhetorical, so don't bother answering. Anyhow, the talent on the floor impressed me. That concludes the exhaustive list of things that impressed me about Duke tonight."

Gov. Henry McMaster announced Monday that he is canceling his order that the state's beaches close and that retail stores close.
   
 The stores affected by the governor's order include furniture stores, clothing stores, sporting goods stores, florists, shoe stores, department stores, music stores, craft stores and flea markets, he said.
   
 McMaster said that stores must abide by social distancing rules set in other sections of his emergency executive order.
   
 All of the Herald-Journal's coverage of coronavirus is being provided for free to our readers. Please consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to GoUpstate.
   
 Stores are limited in how many customers they can allow into the store at any one time. That limit is either 20% of their maximum occupancy or five customers per 1,000 square feet of space.
   
 The governor said that canceling his order closing the beaches puts the decision over whether to open those beaches on local governments in those areas.
   
 He said he had spoken to mayors along the coast, and those officials will be responsible for deciding when the beaches in their jurisdictions open.
   
 Even if the beaches are open, law enforcement officers will still be responsible for dispersing groups of three or more who represent a risk to the health situation in the state, he said.
   
 McMaster said he is able to relax the rules because the people of the state are complying with the state and federal rules recommended to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 "In light of the common sense being shown by the great people of South Carolina, we are ready to take some steps that will help South Carolina assure that our economic health is as strong as our public health," he said.
   
 The governor cautioned residents to continue to take precautions. "We are still in a very serious situation," he said. The virus is deadly and spreads very easily, and people need to practice social distancing.
   
 McMaster said the "measured, deliberate approach" the state has taken is working. He said state policy has been aimed at restricting the spread of the virus as much as possible while harming the state's economy as little as possible.
   
 He spoke about his Accelerate SC campaign, which pulls together state officials with business people from various industries to ramp up the state economy as soon as possible.
   
 The governor said the group will look at workforce issues, logistics and transportation issues in order to "slingshot around the competition" and get the state's business climate up to pre-virus speed quickly.

The coronavirus pandemic has closed down most of the sports world, but the 2020 NFL Draft will go on. That doesn't mean the event, scheduled to run Thursday to Saturday, has been unaffected. Teams have been unable to meet with prospects or hold private workouts, so decisions will be made almost exclusively on the NFL Combine and college game tape. LSU quarterback Joe Burrow and Ohio State pass rusher Chase Young are expected to be the top two picks, but which 2020 NFL Draft prop bets are worth backing?
 The Lions are a prime target for teams looking to trade up to get a quarterback, with the Miami Dolphins at No. 5 and Los Angeles Chargers at six reportedly in the running. Trades could send shockwaves through your 2020 NFL Draft props. With so much uncertainty, you'll want to see the top 2020 NFL Draft picks and predictions from betting expert R.J. White.
 White is widely recognized as one of the nation's premier NFL Draft experts. Every spring, the CBS Sports NFL editor puts together entire seven-round mock drafts read by millions, including trades he expects. No stone is left unturned in White's draft analysis. This is the same expert who, very early in the 2018 draft process, called Baker Mayfield going No. 1 overall at 25-1.
 Moreover, if you had placed $100 on each of White's NFL pointspread picks the past three years, you'd be up more than $2,300. And twice in the past five years, the stats guru cashed big in the world's most prestigious sports handicapping competition, the Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest. Anyone who's followed anything White has picked in the NFL is up big.
 Now, with William Hill taking bets on the 2020 NFL Draft, White has scoured the odds and found 10 bets worth backing big. He's only sharing them here.

The United States is still battling coronavirus, but with six months to go before he faces re-election, President Donald Trump has shifted gears to put immigration -- a bread-and-butter issue for his supporters -- atop the agenda.


  His surprising announcement late Monday that he would move to suspend all immigration into the country is a risky strategy that could backfire -- should he end up accused of using the pandemic to score points on a controversial issue.


  After all, the world's largest economy is staring down the barrel of a prolonged nationwide crisis -- 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment in recent weeks.


  But Trump is comfortable with his unique style of politics, making a vague but major announcement on Twitter, knowing it will galvanize his base and create headlines.


  "In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!" he wrote.


  The statement was certainly light on detail, and the White House did not offer any more specifics Tuesday, either on the timetable or how the policy would be implemented.


  To curb the spread of the deadly contagion, Trump placed restrictions on travel between the US and China in January, and eventually barred foreigners from traveling between the US and most of Europe.


  But the tweet on Monday from the real estate mogul-turned-world leader -- a relentless champion of the need to squelch illegal immigration -- went a step farther.


  It implies that the Republican president simply wants to shut down any legal immigration into the United States for an unspecified period of time.


  In other words, the government would stop issuing work visas or residency permits (green cards) to any foreigners wishing to come live in the country.


  According to US officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Wall Street Journal, the eventual executive order could include exceptions for farm and health care workers.


  The US government issued 462,000 visas in fiscal 2019, according to official data -- a major drop from the 617,000 visas granted in 2016 under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama.


  \- 'Divert attention' -


  Even raising the specter of an executive order on immigration, which would likely face immediate opposition in court, raised hackles among Trump's Democratic opponents.


  Texas lawmaker Joaquin Castro slammed what he called "an attempt to divert attention away from Trump's failure to stop the spread of the coronavirus and save lives."


  In a tweet, Castro accused Trump of "an authoritarian-like move to take advantage of a crisis and advance his anti-immigrant agenda."


  Fellow Democrat Jerry Nadler -- a longtime Trump foe -- hit out at the president for using immigrants as scapegoats for the current crisis.


  "The truth is many immigrants are on our front lines, protecting us as doctors, nurses, health aides, farmworkers, and restaurant workers," Nadler said.


  If, as is likely, the debate shifts to the courts, it will be closely followed.


  The Supreme Court has in recent months offered several significant victories to the Trump administration in cases relating to immigration.


  A month ago, the high court allowed the federal government to maintain a policy that will send more than 60,000 asylum seekers back to Mexico.


  The "Remain in Mexico" policy unveiled in December 2018 and implemented a month later calls for non-Mexican asylum seekers who attempt to enter the US via that country to stay there while their cases are being decided.


  In a bit of further proof -- if any were needed -- that Trump is focused on the November 3 election, his Tuesday morning tweets focused on his approval rating and his 2016 victory at the polls.


  "It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day, and all night," he said.


  "Either I'm really good, far better than the Fake News wants to admit, or they don't have nearly the power as once thought!"

Parents should take these losses seriously. Acknowledge your teenager's fears about their future, and encourage them to look ahead to all the good things waiting for them when the crisis ends. One Florida high schooler says she finds comfort in focusing on the greater good. "As disappointed as we all are that we're missing out on these important milestones in our life we do understand that this virus is killing people, and that if we don't sacrifice these things that we might contribute to the problem," she told KQED.

Producer James Hyland keeps things well balanced throughout, minding a rich tableau that still gives Cevallos’ expressive vocals ample opportunity to securely stake a claim at center stage. At the same time, Cevallos herself injects plenty of personality, coming across as both feisty and forlorn, depending on song and circumstance.

South African Rugby announced on Tuesday huge budget cuts and the cancellation of several events because of the coronavirus pandemic but said it still hoped scheduled Test matches for the world champion Springboks would go ahead.


  Chief executive of SA Rugby Jurie Roux said the sport's stakeholders had agreed to cut between R700 million (about US$36.8 million) and R1 billion (about US$52.6 million) from the budget for the next eight months against what he said was a "worst-case" scenario in which no rugby would be played during the period.


  The cuts will include salary reductions for officials and players.


  "Our income is tied to the playing of professional rugby and without matches we potentially don't have any income," said Roux.


  He said the decision had been agreed in principle by all stakeholders, including representatives of players.


  "These are unprecedented times, not only for rugby in South Africa, but across all spheres of life all over the globe," said Roux.


  Roux said all age group events with the exception of a planned under-21 provincial competition, had been scrapped, while all club rugby was on hold because the country was in lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak.


  But he said home Test matches against Scotland, on July 4 and July 11, remained on the schedule as well as a fixture against Georgia on July 18.


  The first Test against Scotland will hold special significance as it is likely to be the last match at the historic Newlands stadium in Cape Town.


  The Rugby Championship involving home and away matches against Argentina, Australia and New Zealand during August and September, was also still set to go ahead.


  The Currie Cup provincial competition and other franchise tournaments had also not yet been cancelled.


  But Roux said all fixtures were dependent on contingency planning around the ilnness' situation.


  "We are currently on a return to train and play readiness plan but this is dependent on government advice and decisions as the pandemic evolves," he said.

UEFA remains committed to completing the suspended football season in Europe despite the coronavirus pandemic after making "a strong recommendation" on Tuesday that leagues across the continent be played to a conclusion.


  "There was a strong recommendation given to finish domestic top division and cup competitions," European football's governing body said in a statement after holding a videoconference with its 55 member associations.


  However, it added that "some special cases will be heard once guidelines concerning participation to European competitions -- in case of a cancelled league -- have been developed."


  That could be of particular interest to Belgium and Scotland, whose top flights appear to have been awaiting a green light from UEFA to call an end to their seasons now.


  UEFA said any decisions would be announced after its Executive Committee meets on Thursday. Before that it is due to meet with the powerful European Club Association (ECA) and the European Leagues grouping, which represents nearly a thousand clubs in 29 countries, on Wednesday.


  League seasons were halted in mid-March as the coronavirus spread across Europe.


  Some 106,737 deaths due to Covid-19 had been recorded in Europe by Tuesday. Italy, Spain and France have all officially recorded over 20,000 deaths while there have been more than 17,000 in the United Kingdom.


  However, Germany has coped better than most of its neighbours and the German Bundesliga is set to become the first leading league to attempt to restart its season, with clubs expected to agree to a May 9 resumption when they meet on Thursday.


  In Italy, all 20 Serie A clubs voted unanimously on Tuesday to complete the season, albeit they will only do so "if the government authorises it and in full compliance with the rules for the protection of health and safety".


  Initially following the suspension, the end of June had been set out as the target date for finishing the season, but UEFA has since been working on the possibility of playing in July and August.


  It is understood that the scenario drawn up by a UEFA working group is based around completing the Champions League in August, with the final in Istanbul possibly on August 29.


  The Champions League and Europa League are currently on hold "until further notice", with both stuck in the last-16 stage.


  UEFA has already postponed Euro 2020 by a year. They are also likely to put the next women's European Championship back by a year to 2022.


  Despite UEFA's stance, football is at the mercy of the virus and of national governments who have adopted strict lockdown measures to try to halt its spread.


  The Belgian Pro League has previously stated its intention to declare the season finished, but was warned earlier this month by UEFA that its clubs risked being excluded from the next Champions League if it did so unilaterally.


  The decision was unanimously approved by the Pro League board at the start of the month and could be rubber-stamped at a meeting next Monday.


  Meanwhile, Scotland has already declared the season over in the leagues below the top flight and could do the same for the Premiership if UEFA does not object, meaning Celtic would be champions.

One of the best Nova Scotian athletes in history needs just a single word to describe the current situation in her province — "surreal."
 Six-time national women's curling champion Colleen Jones, now a reporter with CBC, has been living out the grim aftermath of Sunday's killing rampage with fellow Nova Scotians at work and at home.
 "Seeing the quiet of the place and realizing the hell that happened on the weekend — it's hard to even envision it," said Jones, voted the province's second-best athlete of all time behind Pittsburgh Penguins star Sidney Crosby in 2017 by the Nova Scotia Sports Hall of Fame.
 "And the horror of a wolf in sheep's clothing, that he had the planning and thought of impersonating an RCMP officer is even more heartbreaking. That of course people would have opened their doors or stopped their car if they saw him in his vehicle. It's just such a horrific thing in such an idyllic province. So many innocent people and the shattered lives that can't grieve properly in a traditional way (because of the COVID-19 pandemic)."
 While Jones has a first-hand look at a province trying to come to grips with at least 19 lives lost, other prominent Nova Scotia athletes can only watch in shock from afar.
 Hamilton Tiger-Cats receiver Brian Jones, a native of Enfield, N.S., now living in Toronto, has been at the gas station and restaurant where the rampage ended "countless times."
 The killing of the active shooter on Sunday in a community with a population of just under 5,000 capped a lengthy police chase that is now the subject of international headlines.
 "It's just hard to put words together right now, honestly, to describe what's happened," Jones said. "It seems so random, so arbitrary. Right where the guy ended up getting taken down is literally within 10 minutes from my house where I grew up. It kind of puts things into perspective. It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, terrible time for a lot of people right now."
 Saskatchewan Roughriders kicker Brett Lauther is a native of Truro, N.S., just down the highway from where the horror started in Portapique.
 Like Jones, an Acadia product, Lauther also played his university football in his home province at Saint Mary's in Halifax.
 "Obviously, just completely heartbroken," Lauther said. "The whole area it kind of covered was all where I grew up. It started about 20-30 minutes north of Truro and went right down past it towards Enfield where it ended. It's just such a small, strong tight-knit community.
 "... I've got some crazy text messages on my phone from my friends, family, RCMP, other officers, people I know there. It couldn't have hit home more.
 "There are no words."
 Colleen Jones is facing the added challenge of trying to cover a tragedy at home as a veteran reporter.

 The open letter by the NGO Values Initiative takes the South African-based academic Achille Mbembe to task for allegedly inflammatory rhetoric that delegitimizes Israel's existence and belittles the Holocaust.
 According to the letter, "Mbembe accuses Israel of apartheid and compares the former South African apartheid system to the Holocaust, this leads to the legitimate assumption that he equates the position of the democratic state of Israel towards the Palestinian Arabs with that of the Nazis during the Holocaust." The prominent group of German Jews said Mbembe represents "an antisemitic picture in its purest form."
 "Calls for boycotts against the Jewish state have a long tradition. From the Nazis' 'don't buy from Jews' campaign to Israel boycott campaigns by German neo-Nazi groups, such as 'The III. Way.' No country in the world is exposed to such calls with this permanence. Coincidence? No. The problem is called antisemitism and… is trivialized by keywords such as 'freedom of art."'
 Mbembe signted a petition sponsored by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign calling for an academic boycott of Israeli professors from Ben- Gurion University of the Negev. The German Bundestag and state of North Rhine- Westphalia declared BDS an antisemitic movement.
 The Jerusalem Post exposed the online payment accounts for the pro-BDS neo- Nazi party in 2019, causing French and US online payment services to close the accounts.
 The public letter signed by Values Initiative chairman Dr. Elio Adler added that "the state of North Rhine-Westphalia must seriously ask itself whether it would like to promote an art festival whose artistic director does not decisively oppose calls for a boycott of the Jewish state, but rather promotes it as part of the freedom of art and invites a speaker, who relativizes the Holocaust. We are firmly convinced that something like this must not have a public space in Germany."
 Stefanie Carp, director of the Ruhrtriennale music and cultural festival,has showed sympathy for the BDS campaign over the years. When asked about the Values Initiative letter, Carp told The Jerusalem Post "Linking Achille Mbembe to antisemitism is grotesque and a disgraceful allegation."
 According to the anti-BDS resolution of North Rhine-Westphalia, public funds are banned for tax-payer funded cultural festivals like Ruhrtriennale.
 Mbembe declined to respond to a new Post query about the Values Initiative letter. He has written that "The time has come for global isolation" of Israel.
 Jochen Mohr, a spokesman for the state's Cultural Minister Isabel Pfeiffer- Poensgen, told the Post that "In coordination with the state chancellery, the state government's answer to your question" is "The supervisory board of Kultur Ruhr will meet this week for its deliberations as announced."
 Adler said in the public letter that Carp's decisions "harms not only the Jewish community by encouraging antisemitic images and argumentation patterns through its invitation policy, but also its own sponsors and thus the state of North Rhine-Westphalia."
 The chorus of voices taking aim at Carp's pro-BDS activities and Mbembe's alleged antisemitism is growing. The prominent journalist Jurgen Kaube wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung a detailed  analysis of Mbembe's attacks on Jews and Israel. Kaube, who invoked Mbembe terminology of racism--the concept of nanoracism.
 Mbembe defines nanoracism by stating "Yet, in the end, what is nanoracism if not that narcotic brand of prejudice based on skin color and expressing itself in seemingly anodyne everyday gestures, often apropos of nothing, apparently unconscious remarks, a little banter, some allusion or insinuation, a slip of the tongue, a joke, an innuendo, but also, it must be added, consciously spiteful remarks…."
 Kaube writes "If one applies this standard to Mbembe's own statements, one can at least speak of nano-antisemitism."
 The Post previously reported on Mbembe's allegedly antisemitic writings.

The Cleveland Browns have their sights set on a left tackle in the 2020 NFL Draft, but have a "Plan B" in case the board doesn't fall in their favor. Per ESPN's Josina Anderson, the Browns are still inquiring about Washington Redskins left tackle Trent Williams \-- with the option of trading for him "still on the table."
 "Nothing is imminent or super close" in terms of a trade, per Anderson, but Cleveland is keeping all its options open.
 The Browns don't appear to be picky on which of the tackles they want in this year's draft. Even though Cleveland needs a left tackle to protect Baker Mayfield's blind side, the Browns would be okay with drafting Iowa's Tristan Wirfs or Alabama's Jedrick Wills -- even though both played right tackle in college.
 "From my perspective, tackles are tackles," Browns general manager Andrew Berry said a few weeks back. "In terms of guys making the switch, certainly there is an element of muscle memory that needs to be reprogrammed, so to speak, for people who have played one side or the other for a long period of time."

State Rep. Russ Diamond (R-Lebanon) told the crowd, “I believe that every one of you is essential and that every one of your businesses and jobs is life- sustaining.” He also criticized a Wolf administration waiver process that has allowed some businesses to reopen. To date, the administration has not released a list of which businesses were approved or denied.
 State Sen. Judy Ward (R-Blair) questioned government mandates, saying, “Do we need the government to mandate that certain businesses close? No.”
 The Department of General Services closed the Capitol complex on March 13, just a few days before Wolf ordered nonessential businesses to shut down physical operations. A spokesperson on Monday said Capitol Police arrested one individual who did not adhere to warnings to stay out of a restricted area. The person was issued a citation for disorderly conduct and released.
 Jodie Zeiders of Reading said she attended Monday’s rally because of her friends who are small business owners. She said she wants them to be able to reopen safely while practicing social distancing and offering workers’ protections.
 “People are hungry. We just need to open it up and use precautions,” she said.
 Stan Casacio, cohost of the AM radio show “Don’t Back Down,” said Wolf should create a committee with lawmakers and business owners to decide which businesses should reopen.
 “Give us an opportunity. I think most people are here to demand transparency as to why some businesses are open, some are not open,” Casacio said. “Poverty kills also.”
 While some of the hundreds in attendance were wearing masks, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many were not. Unlike the flu, COVID-19 “might be spread through the airborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near,” according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.
 Monday’s demonstration was planned in part by Chris Dorr, an Ohio-based far- right activist who organized similar protests with his brothers in other states. Dorr also spearheaded the Pennsylvania Firearms Association, a registered 501(c) 4, which claims there is a “war against the Second Amendment.”

But two things are different right now. First, over the past decade, the United States has itself become the world’s biggest oil producer, which means that the economy in states like Texas, North Dakota, and Louisiana needs higher—not lower—oil prices to keep companies in business and payrolls intact. U.S. oil producers have much higher production costs than rivals in the Middle East, so they need oil around $40 a barrel to break even.

"When I was in law school," begins another, "my roommates and I would play baseball on PlayStation and we had a Harold Reynolds baseball card sitting by the TV so the winner could use it to 'interview' the loser after the game."
 "Nick Saban and I had just a brutal back and forth in the media during my run coaching IU and eventually Texas in NCAA 14's dynasty mode," says yet another. "My quarterback yanking the sword out of the turf when USC came to town caused a stir as well."

 Another goes back to his time in a Mexican adult baseball league based in Northern California, specifically the time he dashed around the bases mistakenly thinking he'd hit a gapper. "Turns out I cleared right center on the fly for my first (and only) home run in baseball," he says. "Post-game, with a bag of duros de harina covered in lime/chili on my lap, I sat in my sh ---y Saturn and talked through the AB. I referenced the struggle. The usual tropes of underdogs.

 "I hope they're inspired enough to reach out to me and tell me some of their fake sports interview tales. I further hope they are moved to temporarily abandon their already diminished responsibilities, harness the controller to their game of choice, and -- win, lose, or restart and win after an unacknowledged loss -- let the credentialed and spectral media hear all about it in razor-edged, PG-13 diction.

And regardless of timing, experts anticipate both short- and long-term changes in business travel.
 Airlines including American, Delta and Lufthansa are already blocking middle seats on flights, said Michael Derchin, an airline analyst, although that’s easy to do when planes are flying with a lot of empty seats.
 He predicted that after stay-at-home orders are lifted, airlines “will do a lot of soul-searching about what the nature of travel will be going forward,” and possibly even reevaluate how they seat passengers on planes to provide more space, if social distancing becomes the “new normal.”
 Paul Metselaar, chief executive of New York-based Ovation Travel Group, a corporate travel agency, said he anticipated that carriers would offer “discounts like you’ve never seen before, since they will be desperate to get people back on planes.”
 And expect efforts to promote cleanliness.
 In late March, Delta announced that it was extending to all aircraft a cleaning process previously used on international planes: a nightly “fogging” program, which involves spraying high-grade disinfectant, effective against communicable diseases. It will fog planes before every flight by early May, it said. And it is also disinfecting high-touch areas like tray tables, armrests and seat-back pockets before every flight.

"And the horror of a wolf in sheep's clothing, that he had the planning and thought of impersonating an RCMP officer is even more heartbreaking. That of course people would have opened their doors or stopped their car if they saw him in his vehicle. It's just such a horrific thing in such an idyllic province. So many innocent people and the shattered lives that can't grieve properly in a traditional way (because of the COVID-19 pandemic)."
 While Jones has a first-hand look at a province trying to come to grips with at least 19 lives lost, other prominent Nova Scotia athletes can only watch in shock from afar.
 Hamilton Tiger-Cats receiver Brian Jones, a native of Enfield, N.S., now living in Toronto, has been at the gas station and restaurant where the rampage ended "countless times."
 The killing of the active shooter on Sunday in a community with a population of just under 5,000 capped a lengthy police chase that is now the subject of international headlines.
 "It's just hard to put words together right now, honestly, to describe what's happened," Jones said. "It seems so random, so arbitrary. Right where the guy ended up getting taken down is literally within 10 minutes from my house where I grew up. It kind of puts things into perspective. It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, terrible time for a lot of people right now."
 Saskatchewan Roughriders kicker Brett Lauther is a native of Truro, N.S., just down the highway from where the horror started in Portapique.
 Like Jones, an Acadia product, Lauther also played his university football in his home province at Saint Mary's in Halifax.
 "Obviously, just completely heartbroken," Lauther said. "The whole area it kind of covered was all where I grew up. It started about 20-30 minutes north of Truro and went right down past it towards Enfield where it ended. It's just such a small, strong tight-knit community.
 "... I've got some crazy text messages on my phone from my friends, family, RCMP, other officers, people I know there. It couldn't have hit home more.

 William M. Satterwhite, III, JD, MD, Chief Wellness Officer at Wake Forest Baptist Health, and his team designed the mask in conjunction with Renfro Corporation. Renfro is manufacturing the masks, which are called the Nightingale™ WS Protective Mask.
 Renfro has the ability to make about one million masks a week at peak capacity and has earmarked the first 300,000 masks for Winston-Salem.
 The first shipment of about 30,000 masks was delivered to Winston-Salem on Monday and distribution is underway.
 “I’m challenging every person in Winston-Salem to continue practicing social distancing and to wear a mask every time they go outside to help dramatically reduce the spread of COVID-19,” Mayor Joines said.
 “The tagline for Mask the City is ‘Wear a mask. Love your neighbor. Protect yourself.’ It is imperative that we all do just that for 40 days to protect our community and change our trajectory for this summer. The next 40 days are a critical time, and we must be diligent,” Joines said. “I am confident that the citizens of Winston-Salem will rise to the occasion under Mask the City. This is our time to shine for all of America to see as we adapt to a ‘new normal’ until a vaccine is developed.”
 Mayor Joines estimates 60,000 or more masks will be made available at no cost to low-income individuals and other at-risk citizens through a variety of community and faith-based organizations.
 To make sure there are enough masks for all local residents, the organizers of Mask the City ask that each person accept only one mask, even if offered masks by multiple organizations.

Decades later, the topics discussed in their politically- and socially-charged songs still remain timely and relevant, such as “I Don't Like Mondays,” written about a real-life deadly school shooting in California. “If I sing [“Mondays”] now, I don't sing about a school shooting in 1979,” says Geldof. “I'm singing about last week's massacre. Or when I sing “Rat Trap,” I still sing about the hopeless and the lost. If I sing “Banana Republic,” it's not about the utterly corrosive and corrupt state of the banana republic that Ireland was when I wrote it—now I'm singing about the political infantilism of the American republic. If I'm singing “Someone’s Looking at You,” it's not about the conditions of the world in 1979—it's about your smart [devices] and Alexa, always tracking.

At lunch, the five members of the family — designated Family A in the paper — appeared healthy. But later in the day, one of them, a 63-year-old woman, experienced a fever and a cough and went to the hospital where she tested positive for the coronavirus.
 Within two weeks, nine others who ate lunch on that floor of the Guangzhou restaurant that day also tested positive. Four were relatives of the first infected woman. They could have been infected outside of the restaurant.
 But for the other five, the restaurant appears to have been the source of the virus.
 Family A’s table was on the west side of the 1,500-square foot dining room, between tables where two unrelated families, B and C, were also having lunch. Family B and Family A overlapped for a period of 53 minutes, and three of its members — a couple and their daughter — became sick. Family C sat next to Family A at the other neighboring table along the same side of the room, overlapping for 73 minutes, and two of its members — a mother and her daughter — became ill.
 An air-conditioning unit next to Family C blew air in the southward direction across all three tables; some of the air likely bounced off the wall, back in the direction of Family C.
 Because the coronavirus had not yet spread widely beyond Wuhan, public health officials were able to trace the recent contacts of Families B and C and determine that the restaurant was the only likely place where they would have crossed paths with the virus.

Most parents of children over the age of 2 can tell you that a kid's birthday is a Very Big Deal. But most of America is in quarantine thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, and birthdays are decidedly less fun when you can't celebrate with all your favorite people. "While gatherings of any size are a no-go these days, there are still plenty of ways to make your little one's day special," writes Katie Hintz-Zambrano at _Mother Mag_. Let your kid dress up in their favorite fancy clothes, consider letting them play hookie from homeschool, and plan a special birthday menu for them. For older kids who might be missing out on partying with friends, maybe create a video montage of pre-recorded well-wishes. And if that doesn't do the trick, Hintz-Zambrano suggests you organize a "drive-by birthday party" where friends "drive by your home, honk, display handmade signs and balloons, maybe give a gift, etc."

Etsisimme uusiin kaupunkeihin kahviloihimme yrittäjiä. He ostaisivat tuotteitamme meiltä, ja me antaisimme tukeamme ja osaamistamme, Huikuri sanoo.
 Huikuri sanoo, että konditoria tekee lomautuksista ja Business Finlandin rahoista huolimatta tappiota joka päivä. Siksi yritys aikoo hakea lisää tukea, mikäli se vain on tulevaisuudessa mahdollista.
 – Haemme kaikkea. Fakta on se, että vaikka teemme yötä päivää töitä, kulut juoksevat. Tarvitsemme suoraakin tukea, sillä emme yhtään tiedä kauan tämä kestää.
 ## Konsultti ei syyllistäisi yksittäisiä yrityksiä
 Start-up-konsultti Sami Kuusela kritisoi kovin sanoin Business Finlandin tukimallia Suomen Kuvalehden blogissa. MTV Uutiset tavoitti Kuuselan, joka pitää Business Finlandin tukimallia älyttömänä.
 Kuuselan mukaan ongelma on se, että monen yrityksen toiminta on kokonaan kielletty. Business Finlandin rahoitusinstrumenteilla yrityksen pitäisi alkaa pakkoinnovoimaan esimerkiksi mobiilisovelluksia, vaikka yrityksellä on kova huoli siitä miten voi maksaa työntekijöiden palkat tai meneekö yritys konkurssiin.
 – Nämä kaksi asiaa eivät mitenkään sovi yhteen, Kuusela sanoo.
 Kuusela rakentaisi korona-avun yrityksille niin, että yritys ensiksi todistaisi, että yritys on ollut terve ja toimiva ennen koronakriisiä. Yrityksen pitäisi myös todistaa, että sen vaikeudet johtuvat koronakriisistä. Kolmantena tuen ehtona olisi suunnitelma siitä, kuinka yritys aikoo nousta kriisin jälkeen.
 – Sitten saisi perustoimintoihin rahaa. Nyt pitää aina olla joku kehitysprojekti, ja tosi harva haluaa kehittää mitään, kun on tosi tiukka paikka, Kuusela sanoo.
 Julkisuudessa on nostettu esiin tiettyjä yrityksiä, jotka ovat saaneet Business Finlandilta 100 000 euron tuen. Kuuselan mielestä ei ole järkevää syyllistää yksittäisiä tuen saaneita yrityksiä.
 – Nämä yritykset ovat tehneet hakemuksensa vaatimusten mukaan. Tämä juuri kertoo siitä, ettei Business Finlandin instrumentti toimi. Yritykset tarvitsevat peruskuluihin rahaa.

While much is still unknown about COVID-19, what is clear is that the virus is most deadly to people with underlying health issues. This includes the 30 million Americans who suffer from some form of kidney disease -- the ninth- leading cause of death in our country.
   
 With growing rates of diabetes, hypertension, obesity and heart disease, nearly 15 percent of U.S. adults suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD), while one in three are at risk for CKD.
   
 These are frightening numbers, made even more frightening by a pandemic that will disproportionately affect a population that relies on sophisticated health care delivery systems to meet their urgent needs.
   
 The most vulnerable of these patients may be the half-million Americans who suffer from kidney failure and depend on dialysis treatments. Unfortunately, South Carolina has the second-largest percentage of dialysis patients in the nation.
   
 That's why, as the number of COVID-19 cases grows in our state, large dialysis organizations and regional hospitals are working to protect these patients.
   
 For instance, several providers teamed up to reallocate three dialysis clinics solely for COVID-19 patients. This will ensure these patients can continue to receive their lifesaving dialysis treatments while protecting the health of the entire dialysis community.
   
 But a less obvious step that is equally essential to providing the best care is the need to create and maintain access to a patient's bloodstream, which makes dialysis possible. One form of access is placing a catheter in a large vein in the chest or upper arm.
   
 Such central venous catheters, though, dramatically increase the risk of death because of infections and other problems, which often results in hospitalization. While never ideal, hospitalization is the last thing a patient or hospital can afford in today's environment.
   
 Thus, the preferred method of dialysis access is attaching an artery to a vein in a patient's arm to create a "super vein," known as a fistula. Creating fistulas has traditionally required surgery, but as hospitals across the nation become overwhelmed, they may no longer be able to do these surgeries.
   
 In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) declared in mid-March that such procedures were "nonessential" and should be stopped. CMS later reversed its decision, but not before there was mass confusion and many canceled operations.
   
 Fortunately, our community has a hospital administration that invests in its doctors and technologies to provide the best care -- and the Spartanburg Hospital System has taken the unusual step of creating a dedicated dialysis access service. We also are speeding the adoption of several innovative approaches that will ensure that patients get the best care during this crisis.
   
 First, we encourage home dialysis whenever possible. Known as peritoneal dialysis, this method uses a catheter in the stomach to deliver fluid that absorbs toxins in the blood. Greater use of home dialysis could allow up to 50 percent of patients to get treatment safely at home instead of at the hospital or a dialysis clinic.
   
 When home dialysis is not feasible, we've turned to technologies that attempt to minimize the number of procedures -- such as a new drug-coated balloon angioplasty to remove clots and blockages that can form in access sites. Studies show this can keep the blood flowing while reducing hospital interventions by half.
   
 We also adopted a less invasive approach to creating fistulas that can be done in an outpatient setting instead of an operating room, thereby preserving limited hospital resources. Using a needle, catheter and heat, we can connect the artery and a vein in a simple 30-minute procedure, without general anesthesia, incisions or stitches.
   
 This is truly a game-changer in our ability to safely create dialysis access during the pandemic.
   
 My surgical career has been dedicated to creating and maintaining dialysis access for kidney failure patients, and I'm passionate about giving patients the best possible care and quality of life.
   
 And now I want to make sure our community is aware of the steps we have taken to reduce the strain on our local hospitals during this unprecedented crisis -- without failing to meet the needs of some of our most vulnerable community members.

Since people are buying extra alcohol, the store has experienced some product issues, including box wine, Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and other popular items, according to Booth. He has not experienced problems with any of the beer. For the week of March 30, Nielsen reported a total alcohol sales increase of 25% with three-liter boxes of wine up 82%, according to Business Insider.
 The rumors of the Wadena Liquor Store closing were clarified on March 13 with a post confirming the store open and on March 30 the hours were adjusted to Monday to Saturday from noon to 8 p.m. and closed on Sundays. As the store continues to remain open, staff are working with the public and wondering if they too might get sick, Booth said. A new part of their days are cleaning door handles, credit card machines and shopping carts every hour, according to Booth and a Facebook post.
 Booth said he feels “very lucky” to have a caring and hardworking staff who are ringing up customers, running for products and carrying items to cars for the drive up service. The process is “pretty slick,” as Booth said, with the product prepared and then delivered to your car. Customers can call in their orders with the products’ name and brand, bottle size and quantity, according to a Facebook post.

Los Angeles Clippers assistant coach Tyronn Lue and Brooklyn Nets star guard Kyrie Irving have had some solid success together. Both helped the Cleveland Cavaliers capture the franchise's first NBA title in 2016 before the two went their separate ways. However, a reunion apparently isn't out of the question as Lue is interested in becoming Brooklyn's head coach, and in turn getting another opportunity to coach Irving, according to Stefan Bondy of the _New York Daily News_.
 Lue joined Doc Rivers' Clippers coaching staff in August after discussions with the Lakers to become their next head coach didn't materialize. Despite the fact that their time together in Cleveland ended with Irving demanding a trade, Lue would have Irving's support in his bid to become the Nets' next head coach, as a recent report suggested that Irving would indeed prefer Lue in Brooklyn.
 Jacque Vaughn was named Brooklyn's interim head coach in early March after the Nets and Kenny Atkinson mutually agreed to part ways. Vaughn held the position for just two games before the 2019-20 season was suspended indefinitely due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. Ultimately, he might not get much of an opportunity to prove himself in Brooklyn.

Allie Able and her fiance, Hunter Wood, decided to give themselves permission to be sad for one final night. They downed a half-gallon of Bride's Cake ice cream while viewing various wedding programming on television.
   
 Now having been engaged for just over a year, the couple had initially set a May 16 wedding date in Greenville. They had continued to hold onto hope the world would return to normal in the aftermath of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and the nuptials could go on as scheduled. When it became highly evident that wouldn't be the case, last month they were able to establish a new Aug. 14 date.
   
 "We eventually got to a point with all the uncertainty that we weren't having fun and not getting to do any of our bridal showers or any of the pre-wedding celebration that people really look forward to," said Able, adding that even if a sense of normalcy returned it would still be too close for comfort. "We just knew it wouldn't feel like our wedding if people were scared to be together, scared to dance and be close to one another."
   
 Able continued, "It's caused a lot of stress and we were feeling like we were losing out on three months of our marriage. There was also a weird fear of what if this is still going on in August. We've definitely gone through a lot of emotions, but after we ate our half-gallon of ice cream we decided we had to stop feeling sorry for ourselves and move forward. So it's been a process."
   
 That's one of the side effects of COVID-19. It has taken a toll on many physically while also significantly draining the collective soul of people across the nation. It's dramatically and negatively altered everything, from important traditions such as weddings, funerals and birthday parties, to even the most basic weekly rituals like simply going to church, having a beverage with friends or heading to the gym for a workout.
   
 "When people can't have their routines and do the things they're used to doing that's a lot of grief," said therapist Cindy Cartee. "There's also anticipatory grief. People are already anticipating the loss of college football or the loss of their senior year of playing whatever sport. Wimbledon, the Masters and all those events being canceled, those are things that give people joy and are the ways people often use to deal with the stress of life. A lot of leisure time and hobbies right now have had to be canceled and a loss of structure and routine is going to impact a person's mental health."
   
 The current climate of social distancing and self-isolating has affected nearly every aspect of daily life, from the smallest of things to important happenings. People are oftentimes living completely alone, some are physically ill or mentally suffering in isolation and people are dying alone with family and friends not allowed to comfort them due to concerns over the coronavirus.
   
 Some areas of the country have for the time being disallowed funeral services in keeping to the guidelines of limiting gatherings, while in places such as Spartanburg, services have been kept to minimal attendance. Many families are opting for a small graveside service with a larger memorial planned for when social distancing is lifted.
   
 "I know some families are more heartbroken because maybe their parents' friends or their friends cannot attend," J.F. Floyd Mortuary general manager Glenn Miller said. "But they understand the circumstance and are all working together just for the safety of everyone. And I think as much as we want to hug each other everyone is just being very cautious and using their hand signals or saying it out loud. A smile or thumbs up sometimes is just as important as a hug."
   
 Lyman United Methodist pastor Brian Gilmer has resorted to prerecording his regular Sunday service -- "basically a message and some music and prayer" -- and then putting it out late Saturday night or early the following morning for his congregation to be able to keep somewhat of their weekly worship routine. Smaller groups comprising activities such as Bible studies and Sunday school classes are being conducted through Zoom video.
   
 "Church isn't just a building, it's the people," Gilmer said. "And what I think we're seeing is the church is missing that community, the ability to be able to come together as the church family. That's kind of been taken away and I think folks are realizing the community thing is pretty big for the church and now you are having to worship at home.
   
 "I'm seeing more and more reaching out via social media and being part of online services and gatherings. I just tell folks a way to kind of fight the depression and isolation is to reach out to people either by phone or FaceTime, try your best to somehow be kind of connected. I think we get in trouble if we try to isolate for too long."
   
 Parishioners often turn to Gilmer even in normal times seeking wisdom or a kind word regarding a difficult situation and that's even more evident during these trying times.
   
 "I think folks are looking for something positive in the midst of all the negative," Gilmer said. "Now when I do call somebody to check on them I notice the conversation maybe lasts a little longer than normal because they do want to hear some positivity, some good words, and more than anything they just want to hear someone else's voice."
   
 The huge void in the everyday sense of normalcy and complete disruption of daily routine has a wide-ranging spectrum of negative results that only increase the longer society is forced to be isolated.
   
 "You have risk of depression and an increase in anxiety, especially for people that already have it," Cartee said. "The stress level is one that is unheard of because people are having to think about am I six feet apart, did I touch my face or I need to wash my hands. You're going to see a decline in cognitive functioning, especially in your older folks if they're isolated, but even in younger people. You've got a lot of people where you're going to see an increase in substance abuse issues, and sadly I think many people are probably going to relapse into whatever their addiction is in everything from food to substances.
   
 "There is risk of an increase in criminal domestic violence and different types of abuse. Just overall health risks where stress relates to our mind, body and spirit. Not being able to do the things we're used to being able to do, the grief is off the charts. Grief is about loss, not just loss in death but loss of dreams and plans. For the seniors in high school, it's the loss of the end of their senior year, their prom and graduation. There's the loss of those having to cancel their weddings."
   
 Able is still enduring a mild sense of anxiety over whether her new mid-August wedding date was set far enough in the future to where the event can go off unencumbered by coronavirus concerns.
   
 "I'm trying not to think too hard about it, but there is definitely some fear we should've pushed it back further," Able said. "It's a mild fear and I really have been trying to contain it. I think if we're still really doing this (social distancing) in August there are probably bigger concerns around us than my wedding, so I've not really allowed myself to go too far down that rabbit hole."
   
 When the time comes and the world is able to return to a regular daily structure, Cartee believes a positive effect from these difficult days could be a broader sense of gratitude toward life's most simple things.
   
 "Going to school, going to work, people may complain a little bit about having to go, but when you can't do those things I think a lot of people are going to have more appreciation for the daily activities of life that we've taken for granted. We all will be more grateful for them when we can return to them."

Sports fans will have to embrace a “new normal,” which probably means not being able to attend live events at crowded stadiums, for the rest of this year, Dr. Anthony Fauci says.
 Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert who often gives updates during President Trump’s daily coronavirus briefings, told the YES Network on Monday that sports could resume this year despite the COVID-19 pandemic but games would have to take place in venues without fans or with fans practicing social distancing.
 “I cannot see a return this year to what we consider normal,” Fauci said. “There would have to be some degree of [social distancing]. It could be as stringent as only television or it could in the stadium with significant difference of space between people and even then, wearing a facial cover.”
 The most likely path to games in the short term might be the much-talked-about “Arizona bubble plan” where all 30 teams would be quarantined in central Arizona hotels and play games in 10 spring training ballparks without fans. Fauci believes that plan could work.

Instead, a fight with a fellow inmate led to Gay’s first stint in segregation, pushing him into a downward spiral that resulted in 22 years in solitary confinement. Shortly after the isolation started, Gay began self-mutilating and attempting suicide.
 Alone for 23 hours a day and starved for human contact, Gay took extreme steps to get attention. He cut himself hundreds of times in his 7-by-12-foot cell, slicing open his neck, forearms, legs and genitals. Once, he packed a fan motor inside a gaping leg wound; another time he cut open his scrotum and inserted a zipper.
 As his mind began to deteriorate, Gay became antagonistic toward his guards and occasionally threw urine or feces at them, unlawful acts of defiance that stretched his original sentence into more than two decades behind bars in the Illinois Department of Corrections.
 "The objective was for me to die there,” he writes in his blog. “However, I survived. The most compelling reason I survived is because I refused to relinquish hope.”
 As attorneys petitioned again and again for his release, Gay began to feed off their optimism and often turned to them for reassurance. He also found comfort in Guideposts magazine, a publication started in 1945 by religious leader Norman Vincent Peale and filled with stories of inspiration.
 “I never fully closed the door to hope,” he said. “It’s the only way a miracle can walk through.”

While president, he created the U.S. Forest Service to protect forests and wildlife, develop reserves, build national monuments and later establish national parks.
   
 During high school, I began to get involved with the GOP at the local level. While being around those great men and women, I noted that climate change was not a topic for conversation unless you wanted to hear something along the lines of "That ain't nothing but a bunch of liberal propaganda!"
   
 So, in today's strictly partisan political climate, who would have ever thought that a conservative could care about the environment?
   
 For as long as I can remember, if you are a conservative, you better oppose the idea of climate change or you will be deemed a RINO. Republicans have been more focused on the nation's economic prosperity.
   
 Across the aisle, the Democrats speak of heavy regulations and increased spending in their approach to protecting the environment. As time progresses, the arguments become even more partisan while the planet becomes even warmer.
   
 Reports from NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency find that carbon emissions continue to rise, the ocean is getting warmer, glaciers are melting, and natural disasters are becoming more frequent than ever before.
   
 I continue to attend and stay involved with the GOP because I am very conservative and see endless potential for the party, especially if it accepts climate change and proposes pro-environment and pro-economy solutions.
   
 Currently in Washington, the left is proposing a Green New Deal that would come with a heavy price tag for taxpayers. In an article published by Forbes, senior contributor and Wall Street veteran Milton Ezrati finds that the bill is heavily filled with strict regulations and various socio-economic reforms. According to his research, the bill would increase federal spending by at least half of the current amount.
   
 On the other side, the Republicans have initiated a conservation caucus to re- evaluate the party's stance on climate change. For a while, there wasn't a conservative response to climate change.
   
 But now, there is. The American Conservation Coalition (ACC) has unveiled the American Climate Contract.
   
 In his opening testimony before the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, ACC founder and president Benji Backer couldn't have expressed my views better when he said, "We must take quick, effective action on climate change, but we cannot regulate our way out of this problem."
   
 The American Climate Contract presents a strategy in which our planet and economy can both thrive.
   
 The proposal has four pillars: energy innovation, 21st century infrastructure, natural solutions and global engagement. The contract proposes that the country can reduce carbon emissions by creating new technologies and pushing for energy independence through diverse energy sources.
   
 While traveling to various states, I have realized the need for the country to improve its infrastructure, which would drastically decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The contract also advocates for and supports the development of energy grids.
   
 For me, the third pillar is one that hits close to home. As one who likes to fish and travel the coast, I would like to see new projects that would restore wetlands across the country.
   
 With these proposed efforts, the United States can lead in the fight against climate change by implementing solutions that give consumers freedom, protect our country's economic prosperity and protect the land we call home.
   
 Teddy Roosevelt expressed it best when he said, "Conservation is a great moral issue, for it involves the patriotic duty of ensuring the safety and continuance of the nation."
   
 I'm a true conservative, and I support the American Climate Contract.

Che estate ci aspetta dal punto di vista della disponibilità delle risorse idriche? Servirà ancora qualche settimana per dare una risposta, ma intanto alcuni elementi sono emersi dalla riunione dell’Osservatorio Permanente sull’Utilizzo delle Risorse Idriche che si è riunito lunedì 20 aprile in videoconferenza, collegando oltre 50 tra istituzioni nazionali e regionali, esperti, amministratori locali e gestori.


  Prima di tutto, si deve tener conto delle analisi nel complesso del territorio distrettuale condotte da Irsa-Cnr. L’analisi dei dati registrati tra gennaio e marzo 2020 evidenzia precipitazioni invernali fortemente negative sull’intero versante tirrenico e sulle Marche e nella media nelle aree costiere dell’Abruzzo. Più in generale, il versante adriatico presenta su scala annuale condizioni maggiormente siccitose rispetto al versante tirrenico, anche sulle aree costiere, estendendo, poi, l’analisi su scala biennale viene confermata una tendenza verso condizioni siccitose sulla dorsale carbonatica e sulla costa marchigiana. Si tratta di una situazione che evidenzia differenti possibili situazioni di rischio di crisi idriche nel territorio distrettuale.


  Il tutto fa presupporre che in estate, se non ci saranno ulteriori precipitazioni importanti nei prossimi mesi – l’anno scorso nel mese di maggio le precipitazioni registrate aiutarono in una situazione abbastanza compromessa - le sorgenti caratterizzate da tempi di ricarica più brevi potranno subire decrementi di portata significativi e, in alcune zone del distretto, anche le sorgenti più grandi, quelle caratterizzate da una resilienza maggiore alla scarsità di precipitazioni. Di sicuro, secondo il CNR-IRSA, gli indici sulle portate di alcune sorgenti del Distretto al momento sono confrontabili con quelli di anni molto siccitosi (2007, 2012, 2017).


  Dunque andiamo verso un’estate a rischio siccità con problematiche nella distribuzione della risorsa com’è stata quella del 2017?


  Non proprio. Innanzitutto, dobbiamo considerare che a seguito della crisi del 2017 sono stati attivati numerosi interventi e investimenti dalle Regioni del Distretto, dai Gestori del Servizio Idrico e dalla Protezione Civile, con interventi sulle riduzioni delle perdite delle reti e aumento dell’efficienza nella distribuzione prevedendo anche interconnessioni e nuove fonti di approvvigionamento da attivare in emergenza siccitosa. Alcuni di questi interventi sono in corso e saranno ultimati prima della stagione estiva, sempre che vi sia la possibilità di riprendere i cantieri temporaneamente interrotti a seguito dell’emergenza sanitaria. Naturalmente sulla situazione un peso importante le precipitazioni nei mesi di aprile e maggio.


  L’Autorità di bacino distrettuale dell’Appennino centrale, per non farsi trovare impreparata, in attesa di riconvocare i soggetti che fanno parte dell’Osservatorio nella riunione che si terrà tra la fine di maggio e l’inizio di giugno, ha già acquisito, a fine marzo, dalle Regioni resoconti dettagliati sulla situazione e sulle misure già attivate e da attivare. Inoltre, nella riunione dell’ultimo Osservatorio dell’altro giorno si è deciso di acquisire, grazie alla collaborazione con CNR-IRSA, in uno step intermedio la situazione delle precipitazioni aggiornata ad aprile, per poi fornire nel prossimo Osservatorio lo scenario aggiornato a tutto il mese di maggio.


  In tutto ciò c’è un’altra incognita di cui tener conto, un’incognita che solo qualche mese fa nessuno si sarebbe mai aspettato, la pandemia da coronavirus: le zone costiere, in particolare delle Marche, si popoleranno di vacanzieri al pari degli anni passati e ci sarà dunque un incremento della necessità idrica? Anche in questo caso, una risposta certa potrà venire soltanto nelle prossime settimane, quando saranno attuate le disposizioni del Governo della Fase 2 per il contrasto alla diffusione del virus Covid-19.


  Ancora dei punti interrogativi, dunque, ma di fronte ai quali si stanno già verificando le possibili risposte per contenere per quanto possibile i disagi.


  Entro questa settimana sarà disponibile sul sito web dell’Autorità un resoconto tecnico di sintesi della situazione registrata nella riunione di Osservatorio del 20 aprile unitamente alle relazioni integrali fornite nell’occasione dal CNR-IRSA, dalle Regioni e dai Gestori del Sistema Idrico Integrato del Distretto.

Palermo, 21 apr. (Adnkronos) - Risalgono al 2009 i primi smottamenti del terreno ai piedi del Monte Falcone a Baucina, nel Palermitano. Nella periferia a sud del centro abitato sono, infatti, notevoli i danni causati alla pavimentazione del cimitero, con infiltrazioni di acqua e lesioni in alcune tombe e cappelle, con pericolo per l’incolumita dei visitatori. E’ per questo che la Struttura contro il dissesto idrogeologico, guidata dal presidente della Regione siciliana Nello Musumeci, ha prima programmato, e subito dopo finanziato, i lavori di consolidamento e di messa in sicurezza. Un’opera per la quale l’Ufficio diretto da Maurizio Croce - che in queste settimane ha potenziato i livelli di operativita e di produttivita precedenti alla diffusione del Coronavirus - ha portato a termine la relativa gara che oggi vede in cima alla graduatoria - con un ribasso del 31,7 per cento, su un importo di 240mila euro - la Gangi Impianti. Il progetto mira a migliorare le condizioni di stabilita del pendio su cui insiste il cimitero. Sono previsti interventi di recupero e di ripristino delle strutture murarie che lo cingono ai quattro lati e di protezione idraulica per eliminare le infiltrazioni mediante una trincea drenante. Verra, inoltre, costruito un muro in cemento armato della lunghezza di sessanta metri a monte della parte vecchia del cimitero, che e quella piu compromessa dal dissesto in atto. Si procedera infine con la pulizia e la rimozione delle sterpaglie lungo il muro perimetrale.

Economists Dudley and Blinder followed Metcalf’s disease analysis with an economic one. “We want to turn this into as close as we can to a timeout,” Dudley said. “Things pause and then resume.” But our panel acknowledged that we can’t truly “pause”. There is already massive human cost with more than 26,000 deaths in the US. But economically, perhaps a recovery will come quickly with an economic restart.

The virus was stopped by aggressive “non-pharmaceutical interventions”, Metcalf explained, though they were implemented to varying degrees in different cities. These isolation mandates, like the ones we are implementing now in the U.S., kept people at home, apart, and let the economy grind to a halt. But cities using these same interventions actually did better economically by some metrics when it was over, Metcalf explained.

Cleveland did sign Jack Conklin to a three-year, $42 million deal this offseason, so the Browns are set at right tackle. Perhaps the Browns use the No. 10 pick and select one of the talented offensive lineman on the board and trade for Williams as a "bridge tackle" while the rookie develops. Cleveland, like 31 other NFL teams, are in unprecedented circumstances as the Browns will not be able to work with their rookies at team facilities this offseason -- halting their development and the prospect of them beginning the season in the starting lineup.
 This is where Williams comes in. Cleveland has been interested in a trade for Williams for some time and former Redskins head coach Bill Callahan is the Browns' offensive line coach. Callahan was the Redskins' offensive line coach from 2015 to 2018, helping Williams earn four consecutive Pro Bowl selections and establishing him as one of the best left tackles in the game.
 Williams, who will be 32 years old in July, made the Pro Bowl seven consecutive seasons from 2012 to 2018 before sitting out the 2019 season due to disagreements with Redskins management. He is owed $14.5 million in 2020, the final year of his contract.

The crux of the protesters' arguments was the societal costs of the closures, such as skyrocketing unemployment and uncertain child care situations, outweigh their public health benefits. Fred Schlachter, a Cheyenne resident whose wife helped organize the rally, said he would like Gov. Mark Gordon to reopen the state "today or tomorrow."
 "We think waiting until May 1 to open Wyoming up and to open up business and put people back to work is much too long," Schlachter said.
 The protesters were eventually joined by Gordon, who came out of the Capitol to lead a prayer and then try to address some of the crowd's concerns. After his prayer, the governor reminded the crowd that Wyoming is one of just a handful of states that have not issued a shelter-in-place order for its residents.
 "I relied on the good people of Wyoming, who I knew would do the right thing, and I'm looking at success, even as we speak," Gordon said.
 The governor told the crowd he had just been in a meeting that morning to discuss how to reopen businesses in a safe way. Gordon said he has been in talks with the governors of the seven other states without shelter-in-place orders, adding the public should expect to hear from the group soon.
 "I am not sure when we get back to normal, but I can tell you when we're going to work, and it's as soon as we possibly can," Gordon said, with some protesters responding with yells of "Now!" and "Today!"
 Despite the crowd's frustration, some in attendance thanked Gordon for coming out to speak with them – something other governors haven't done during similar rallies across the U.S. But he remained steadfast in his desire to only lift the orders once health data indicate it is safe to do so.
 "When we go back to work, we want to make sure we can continue to work," Gordon said near the end of his appearance.

It was expected that Hudson Mosher Royaltey would have a creative life, one filled with music but nobody could have guessed that it would happen so fast... or with such force. The son of Susie Mosher and Hope Royaltey was much-discussed before his birth on March 11th. Once the cat was out of the bag, courtesy of an episode of Cash Cab that Royaltey and Mosher appeared on, discussion of Royaltey's pregnancy became fodder for regular conversation during Susie's weekly variety show The Lineup With Susie Mosher; more than idle prattle, though, the imminent birth became musical entertainment that lasted for months. Mosher, a genius at impromptu song composition, sang out one night, "Grandma's having a baby!" and the on-the-spot composition developed into a theme song to be sung at every installment of The Lineup, and if Susie didn't sing it, fans called out to her, requesting it. Months of hearing the song "Grandma's Having A Baby" set the tone for Hudson's life, and the last month has yielded greatness in creativity, as some of the industry's most talented and most prominent performers have serenaded Hudson with a little ditty made up by Mosher, as she changed his didie.
