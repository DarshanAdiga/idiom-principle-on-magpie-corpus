If Kenya is to start maize importation, it will have to turn to Mexico, with the first batch expected in the country later in July, leaving the country’s food distressed as millions already pressed by the coronavirus pandemic look up to the State for food aid.
 In Monday’s session, Mr Munya came under fire following the revelation that thousands of bags of maize at the government’s strategic food reserve are set to be destroyed.
 The CS who appeared before the committee chaired by Senator Njeru Ndwiga said the government does not have any maize stocks in its stores since whatever is available is bound for disposal.
 “We don’t have any stocks in the strategic reserves. What is there is unfit for consumption and will be given to cement manufacturers to be used as fuel,” Mr Munya said.
 Quarterly food security outlook on the country released last month by the Famine Early Warning System Network predicted that at least 17 counties would be food stressed between February and May.
 Kenyans across the country are already being forced to spend as much as Sh150 for a tin of maize, which until recently retailed at Sh90.
 Senator Naomi Shinyonga said it is saddening that maize was rotting in government stores due to poor preservation when Kenyans going without food.
 She questioned why the government was rushing to allow maize imports instead of preserving what farmers have produced.
 Before the government abandoned the business of buying and storing maize some few weeks ago, the National Cereal and Produce Board was the main buyer and stockist of the grains.
 Last year the government destroyed 124,486 bags of maize from its stores on aflatoxin contamination claims.
 Meanwhile, the government has permitted millers to import four million bags of maize from Mexico to bridge an impending shortfall in the country.
 Questioned by committee on why the country was importing maize instead of encouraging millers to buy the commodity from local farmers, the Agriculture minister said the stock being held by farmers wasn’t enough to feed the country hence the need to supplement through importation.

 “If the pandemic were their true motivations, then they would simply postpone the June 23 election entirely and not simply the presidential election," he said. “This is a huge slippery slope. It creates a terrible and dangerous precedent."
 Torres heard 90 minutes of arguments on a conference call in the Manhattan federal court case before saying she’ll issue her ruling in “due course."

Merkel has warned that reopening too swiftly risks triggering a second wave of infections.Germany has been more successful than other large European countries in slowing the virus' spread - it estimates that every 100 carriers of the virus now infects only 74 others on average, well below the 100 mark where new restrictions must be imposed

There were faces in the stands at a game on Tuesday — pictures placed in the seats because fans aren't allowed into the venues, at least for now.
 Instead, it was easy to hear players cheering and shouting from dugouts. It was also a relief to fans watching from home in a country that’s now attempting a slow return to pre-COVID-19 normalcy amid a waning caseload.
 The country’s professional soccer leagues will kick off Friday, also without spectators in the stadiums.
 As one of the world’s first major professional sports leagues to return to action amid the pandemic, the Korea Baseball Organization has employed various preventive measures aimed at creating safe playing environments.
 Players and coaches will go through fever screenings before entering stadiums, while umpires and first- and third-base coaches must wear masks during games. Players are prohibited from high-fiving teammates or signing autographs. Chewing tobacco was banned to prevent spitting. Masks and latex gloves will be required at training facilities.
 Fans will be barred from games until the KBO is convinced the risk of infections has been minimized. If any member of a team tests positive for the coronavirus at any point during the season, the league will be shut down for at least three weeks.
 On Tuesday, teams tried to create a festive atmosphere in the empty stadiums.
 In a game in the capital, the Seoul-based LG Twins opened up against the Doosan Bears, their crosstown rivals and the defending champions, at Jamsil Stadium, where the outfield seats were decked out with huge banners of the Twins’ cheering slogans.
 At Incheon, the SK Wyverns imitated a home crowd by covering their outfield seats with rows of horizontal banners showing the faces of fans wearing Wyverns caps and masks as they hosted the Daejeon-based Hanwha Eagles.
 A full season of baseball seemed doubtful in early March, when South Korea was reporting around 500 new virus infections a day, forcing the KBO to postpone its opening day, which had been scheduled for March 28.
 But South Korea reported just three new cases on Tuesday, its lowest daily total since infections surged in late February. Experts credit the downward trend to tightened border controls and active efforts to test and isolate virus carriers and trace their contacts, using medical, banking and immigration records and location information provided by police and telecommunications companies.
 Officials have started relaxing social distancing guidelines and are preparing to reopen schools, starting with high-school seniors on May 13.
 Barring any virus-related suspension, the KBO plans to maintain a 144-game regular season schedule. But it decided to scrap its all-star game and shorten the first round of the playoffs from a best-of-five to a best-of-three series.
 In the U.S., where MLB has yet to start, six KBO games per week will be aired on ESPN.

A plastic disc as tall as a man and strung with knotty ropes like jellyfish tentacles was found marooned on Palm Beach over the weekend after traversing the tropical Atlantic as a fugitive.


   


  Despite its sea-battered state, the contraption discovered Saturday was a sophisticated version of a fish aggregating device -- an apparatus used often in waters off West Africa to attract tuna.


   


  The devices, which can be as rudimentary as bamboo or oil jugs lashed together with netting hung beneath them, have been increasingly spotted on Florida beaches although scientists are unsure if it's because there are more of them, or if people are just reporting them more.


   


  If the devices find their way into the North Equatorial Current and are whisked toward the Caribbean, they can be harmful to the environment, bashing coral heads and drowning sea turtles in nets that dangle up to 300 feet deep.


   


  Saturday's find was made on the beach in front of the Palm Beach Par 3 Golf Course by a resident who didn't know what the odd object was, but knew it didn't belong there.


   


  "He knew it was of enough importance to send me a photograph of it," said Diane Buhler, founder of the non-profit Friends of Palm Beach, which regularly cleans the beach of trash. "The plastic would take forever to break down, but it does gather all the goodies, like barnacles, that attract the fish."


   


  The bump of Palm Beach County's coastline makes it a hot spot for fish aggregating devices, or FADs, if they get caught in the Gulf Stream.


   


  David Kerstetter, an associate professor with Nova Southeastern University's Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences, said FADs have been found in the Gulf of Mexico, Ireland and the Azores as they travel the ocean currents.


   


  Kerstetter, who monitors FADs through the Caribbean FAD Tracking Project, picked up the device found Saturday after Buhler brought it to her house. He said the project will log the details of the FAD in an effort to ultimately determine what impacts they may be having on the environment.


   


  As with the more hi-tech FADS, the recent find came with about a 10-pound buoy that is solar powered and includes a GPS locator so fisherman can more easily find the device at sea.


   


  Fish that congregate under the device are gathered by a "purse seine" -- a large wall of netting that encircles an entire area or school of fish with a line that can close the net at the bottom.


   


  Adult tuna, billfish and dolphinfish are the target catch for the FADS, but juvenile fish, sharks and other species also can get caught up in the catch.


   


  The Pew Charitable Trust estimated that 81,000 to 121,000 FADS were deployed in 2013.


   


  Buhler said her beach cleaners have found pieces of the devices for years, but didn't know what they were until 2019 when a large plastic intact FAD similar to Saturday's was found.


   


  "The pandemic I've been dealing with for two decades now is plastics in the ocean," Buhler said.

"The broader reality is the global travel market is in a very bad way. In our part of the world and around the trans-Tasman route it makes clear sense that a travel bubble can work in our neck of the woods," said Simon Westaway, executive director at the Australian Tourism Industry Council.


  Qantas, Australia's biggest airline, wants to start using the travel bubble once domestic flights across Australia are resumed.


  "It's a positive we weren't expecting up till now and hopefully it can be established as a model to open part by part the international network when various countries have a control on Covid-19," said the airline's chief executive, Alan Joyce.


  According to Mr Joyce, New Zealand is the second-largest source of tourists heading into Australia, while Australia is the largest source of tourists for New Zealand.


  He said it would give people in Australia a destination "that they're comfortable flying to", and vice versa.


  Mr Joyce hopes the travel bubble can be extended to more countries if successful.


  "If the New Zealand bubble idea gets traction and that we're comfortable with that and that seems like it's working well, then a similar approach could be done with markets where countries have Covid-19 under control."


  Chris Roberts, chief executive of New Zealand's tourist board Tourism Industry Aotearoa, said it needed the correct health safeguards and the best use of technology to work.


  "If New Zealand and Australia can show this can work, then it is likely to be adopted elsewhere. It could be 12-18 months before we return to open borders."

Since when are blue states the enemy? Huh?


  When doctors and nurses treat patients in the ER, do doctors and nurses first question whether the patient is a Republican or a Democrat? Or from a red state or a blue state? And if in a red _republican_ state emergency room, would a blue _democratic_ patient be rejected and wheeled out onto the street?


  That would be uncivilized. And Senator McConnell, it makes you sound very mean, and not very thoughtful.


  With McConnell’s strident point of view, it would be just terrible if his _Red_ state home were to catch fire in a _Blue_ state.


  Blue state firefighters told that Senator McConnell was from a Red state, would have to just let his home burn down to the concrete blocks.


  “Can’t help you out, Senator. You’re in a _Blue_ state now, and you’re a red- stater. Sorry, but you were the one who made up the regulations. You gotta live by them."


  Confusing? Yes, but that's what Senator Mitch McConnell said.


  All by himself, Mitch McConnell, representing the little state of Kentucky, with a population of about 5 million, is playing dictator of the United States of America. That takes enormous imagination.


  "Let blue states go bankrupt." That isn’t American, nor is it in the Constitution, but smacks of ding-dong dumb. And that was what Senator Mitch McConnell said.


  Stay after school and clean the erasers. Then read the Constitution for homework. And let the meaning of those words transfer into your soul.

Hotels and restaurants will be the next to open. The final reopening phase would add arts, entertainment and recreation venues.
 But it remains unclear as to whether any of the regions will get the green light to begin reopening May 15.
 The Cuomo administration wants the state's 10 regions to clear seven hurdles related to the pandemic.
 Western New York, which includes Niagara County, hit only two of those seven metrics, as it has not met the benchmarks for testing and three-day rolling averages for hospitalizations. The region does meet the standard set for hospital bed and intensive care unit capacities.
 The North County, the Mohawk Valley, the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes came up with the strongest scores in the state based on their relatively low numbers of infections, allowing them to meet five of the seven criteria.
 However, the standards will require that testing capacity increases. The state is requiring there be 30 tests for every 1,000 residents every month.
 All of the regions will also be required to have contact tracers in place to locate and warn people who have come in contact with infected people.
 Clinton County Administrator Michael Zurlo told CNHI the leaders of the seven county governments in the North Country "are in active conversation" in formulating a coordinated approach to reopening.
 Questions remain as to what information state officials will require from local officials, he said.
 "We want to know what the process is going to be," Zurlo said. "Is something going to have to be submitted? Is somebody supposed to be leading the region? Do we come up with that ourselves? Those are the kinds of questions we have."
 The list of hurdles needed to be cleared could prove "disappointing" to many employers that have been diligently working to come up with protocols to counter the infection threat in their workplaces, suggested Sen. Rob Ortt, R-North Tonawanda.

From laptops to apparels, people are logging on to e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Paytm Mall and Snapdeal to place orders for non-essential items, but lack of adequate manpower amid the lockdown could delay deliveries, as per industry executives.
 E-commerce companies have been permitted to sell all items in orange and green zones starting from Monday, the first day of the third phase of the nationwide lockdown that began on March 25.
 Depending on the number of cases of coronavirus infections, areas have been divided into red, orange and green zones. In the red zones, which include Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad, the companies can ship only essential items like grocery, medicines and healthcare products.
 However, shortage of staff at warehouses and logistics hubs could result in delays in deliveries of items, as per the executives.
 An Amazon India spokesperson said the company saw demand for various kinds of smart devices, products related to electrical appliances, clothes and work from home enablers, among others on the first day after delivery of non- essentials resumed in orange and green zones.
 "Our consumers in orange/ green zones are buying other priority products that they needed the most. Thousands of sellers have received orders for the first time since the lockdown began in March and we are hopeful that this will help jumpstart the livelihood of many small sellers and their workforce," the spokesperson said.
 The company reiterated its demand that the list of priority products be expanded for customers in the red zone as well in order to revive economic activity while serving urgent needs and ensuring citizen safety in a high-risk area.
 Under the first and second phase of the nationwide lockdown between March 25 and May 3, the government only allowed delivery of essential goods, including grocery, pharmaceuticals and healthcare products, through e-commerce platforms.
 A Snapdeal spokesperson said the company expects 80-90 per cent of its sellers in the orange and green zones to become active over the course of this week.
 On an average, deliveries are being promised within 6-10 days and actual deliveries are likely to be completed in lesser number of days, the spokesperson added.
 "Thousands of our sellers received orders for non-essential products on Day 1... We have started picking up orders from sellers in Salem, Amritsar, Gurugram and Guwahati, amongst many other locations.
 "Some of the products supplied by our sellers today include steel utensils, apparel, footwear, notebooks and pens, and electronics like power banks, phone and laptop chargers," the spokesperson said.
 Paytm Mall Vice President Srinivas Mothey noted that consumer electronics, laptops, mobile phones, home, and fashion products were among the few categories that were doing extremely well on its platform.
 "...We believe this trend would continue for the next couple of days. As we have noticed earlier people are ordering the most for work and study from home essentials. Depending on the type of product we are offering delivery timelines between two to five days," he added.
 However, industry executive also pointed out that companies are facing challenges on a few fronts.
 An executive, who did not wish to be named, said lesser manpower at warehouses and those available as delivery staff could result in delivery timelines getting delayed.
 The companies could look at sharing delivery resources from other digital business like online food delivery to shorten delays, the executive noted.
 A senior industry executive said apart from the guidelines issued by the centre, there are rules specified by states and even districts. Given that the classification of red, orange and green zones is in a dynamic state, it could make operations difficult for online commerce platforms, the executive said.
 The classification of zone changes, depending on the number of coronavirus cases in a particular area.
 Also, standalone retail shops -- irrespective of whether they sell essential or non-essential items -- have been allowed to operate in red zones while e-commerce platforms are not allowed to ship non-essential items to such areas. There is no level-playing field between the two modes, the executive quoted above said.
 Another challenge for e-commerce companies that follow the marketplace model like Amazon India, Flipkart and Snapdeal is that many of their sellers are either located or have their warehouses in red zones.
 The home ministry guidelines, issued a few days ago, remain unclear on operations of these marketplace sellers of non-essential products, who are in red zones. So, they are dependent on how local authorities issue their guidelines, the executive said.

The great Philly punk band Dark Thoughts have been tearing up the DIY circuit in recent years, playing their fast and melodic pogo music with a verve and energy that we rarely see from anyone. They released their most recent album _Must Be Nice_ in December, and it _rules_. Dark Thoughts have never been shy about admitting that they are Ramones disciples, pure and simple. (Frontman Jim Shomo has gone so far as to call Dark Thoughts a "Ramones band.") So maybe it's a little obvious and on-the-nose for Dark Thoughts to drop a Ramones cover. It's still awesome, though.

Our expectation is that cement growth in FY21 or cement volume decline could be as much as high single digit, maybe like 8-9% and probably recover in FY22 on the back of growth in roadways and potentially rural housing or affordable housing segments. If you were to ask me a particular area that I would want to play the infrastructure story, I would look at cement. So cement is a space we have been bullish on from a two-year perspective where we have been positive on largecaps like Shree Cement and UltraTech. Especially in Shree, we think that volume growth is going to be the key driver of the stock and the volume growth is going to come on the back of internal accruals and not so much because the company is going to take on greater debt.

From laptops to apparels, people are logging on to e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Paytm Mall and Snapdeal to place orders for non-essential items, but lack of adequate manpower amid the lockdown could delay deliveries, as per industry executives.E-commerce companies have been permitted to sell all items in orange and green zones starting from Monday, the first day of the third phase of the nationwide lockdown that began on March 25.Depending on the number of cases of coronavirus infections, areas have been divided into red, orange and green zones. In the red zones, which include Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad, the companies can ship only essential items like grocery, medicines and healthcare products.However, shortage of staff at warehouses and logistics hubs could result in delays in deliveries of items, as per the executives.An Amazon India spokesperson said the company saw demand for various kinds of smart devices, products related to electrical appliances, clothes and work from home enablers, among others on the first day after delivery of non-essentials resumed in orange and green zones.&quot;Our consumers in orange/ green zones are buying other priority products that they needed the most. Thousands of sellers have received orders for the first time since the lockdown began in March and we are hopeful that this will help jumpstart the livelihood of many small sellers and their workforce,&quot; the spokesperson said.The company reiterated its demand that the list of priority products be expanded for customers in the red zone as well in order to revive economic activity while serving urgent needs and ensuring citizen safety in a high-risk area.Under the first and second phase of the nationwide lockdown between March 25 and May 3, the government only allowed delivery of essential goods, including grocery, pharmaceuticals and healthcare products, through e-commerce platforms.A Snapdeal spokesperson said the company expects 80-90 per cent of its sellers in the orange and green zones to become active over the course of this week.On an average, deliveries are being promised within 6-10 days and actual deliveries are likely to be completed in lesser number of days, the spokesperson added.&quot;Thousands of our sellers received orders for non-essential products on Day 1... We have started picking up orders from sellers in Salem, Amritsar, Gurugram and Guwahati, amongst many other locations.&quot;Some of the products supplied by our sellers today include steel utensils, apparel, footwear, notebooks and pens, and electronics like power banks, phone and laptop chargers,&quot; the spokesperson said.Paytm Mall Vice President Srinivas Mothey noted that consumer electronics, laptops, mobile phones, home, and fashion products were among the few categories that were doing extremely well on its platform.&quot;...We believe this trend would continue for the next couple of days. As we have noticed earlier people are ordering the most for work and study from home essentials. Depending on the type of product we are offering delivery timelines between two to five days,&quot; he added.However, industry executive also pointed out that companies are facing challenges on a few fronts.An executive, who did not wish to be named, said lesser manpower at warehouses and those available as delivery staff could result in delivery timelines getting delayed.The companies could look at sharing delivery resources from other digital business like online food delivery to shorten delays, the executive noted.A senior industry executive said apart from the guidelines issued by the centre, there are rules specified by states and even districts. Given that the classification of red, orange and green zones is in a dynamic state, it could make operations difficult for online commerce platforms, the executive said.The classification of zone changes, depending on the number of coronavirus cases in a particular area.Also, standalone retail shops -- irrespective of whether they sell essential or non-essential items -- have been allowed to operate in red zones while e-commerce platforms are not allowed to ship non-essential items to such areas. There is no level-playing field between the two modes, the executive quoted above said.Another challenge for e-commerce companies that follow the marketplace model like Amazon India, Flipkart and Snapdeal is that many of their sellers are either located or have their warehouses in red zones.The home ministry guidelines, issued a few days ago, remain unclear on operations of these marketplace sellers of non- essential products, who are in red zones. So, they are dependent on how local authorities issue their guidelines, the executive said.

The Bluetooth apps keep a temporary record of the signals they encounter. If one person using the app is later confirmed to have COVID-19, public health authorities can use that stored data to identify and notify other people who may have been exposed.


  Apple and Google say that apps built to their specifications will work across most iPhones and Android devices, eliminating compatibility problems. They have also forbidden governments to make their apps compulsory and are building in privacy protections to keep stored data out of government and corporate hands and ease concerns about surveillance.


  For instance, these apps rely on encrypted “peer to peer” signals sent from phone to phone; these aren’t stored in government databases and are designed to conceal individual identities and connections. Public-health officials aren’t even in the loop; these apps would notify users directly of their possible exposure and urge them to get tested.


  In the U.S., developers are pitching their apps directly to state and local governments. In Utah, the social media company Twenty sold state officials on an approach combining Bluetooth with satellite-based GPS signals. That would let trained health workers help connect the dots and discover previously hidden clusters of infection.

There has been a lot of outrage and abuse directed at the members of the group already, with many people publicly calling for them to be arrested.
 The names and Instagram handles of the members have also been made public on social media platforms.
 However, Dr Kumar told the BBC that going after the members of the group in public on the internet was counterproductive and would not solve the issue in the long term.
 "The aim is not to damage them. The aim is to get them out of this kind of behaviour," she said, adding that these chats were typical of the kind of high-risk behaviour that children of this age indulged in.
 "The problem also is that with the internet, children are much more exposed to this kind of content, and they think that this is desirable behaviour. The only thing that can help is prolonged counselling so that they can see what they did was wrong," she said.
 "Going after them will only make them more angry and defensive, and will not solve the issue. We want these boys to reform and become better members of society."

Germany's state premiers will agree on measures to further ease coronavirus restrictions in a teleconference with Chancellor Angela Merkel scheduled for Wednesday, two people familiar with the preparations told Reuters on Monday.
 The state premiers are expected to give the green light for large shops to reopen, probably from May 11, the sources said.
 Smaller shops are already back to business in Europe's largest economy as long as they respect social distancing rules to slow the spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.
 German states are also set to allow the Bundesliga soccer league to resume matches, probably from May 15, under strict conditions without fans in stadiums, the sources said.
 At the same time, state premiers will allow outdoor sports for non- professionals and children, the sources added.
 The states will also agree to reopen schools for all grades step-by-step, though most children will only be allowed to go to class in rotating shifts, not on daily basis, the sources said.
 Officials are also aware that "something needs to be done" to gradually reopen day nurseries and kindergartens for as many toddlers as possible to help working parents, one source said Germany took a further step on the long road back to post-coronavirus normality on Monday, with museums and hairdressers reopening under strict conditions, churches opening their doors for worshippers, and more car factories resuming work.
 But more than a month after Germany suspended all but essential social and commercial life to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, politicians are at odds over how far and how fast to move.
 There is mounting pressure from business groups and some regional governments who are anxious to move faster on restarting economic life. Merkel has warned that reopening too swiftly risks triggering a second wave of infections.
 Germany has been more successful than other large European countries in slowing the virus' spread - it estimates that every 100 carriers of the virus now infects only 74 others on average, well below the 100 mark where new restrictions must be imposed

  A start in the Carabao Cup win at MK Dons a month later doubled his Liverpool tally having made his debut in a 2-1 FA Cup defeat at Wolves earlier that year.


  James Milner was one of the observers to comment on the growing maturity of Jones's game after the pair had worked in tandem down the left side against the Dons.


  “I’ve seen a massive difference in Curtis in the last year,” the Liverpool vice-captain said in the wake of the 2-0 win in Milton Keynes.


  “He’s always had that ability but seems a bit more mature now; [he’s] defending well, getting his angles right when he’s defending.


  “I think he’s realised as well that if you want to play for Liverpool, that’s as important as the stuff on the ball. Not only that, he’s got so much ability and skills and tricks, and it’s about using them in the right area.”


  Jones's next trick was off the bench, as he helped turn the Carabao Cup tie against Arsenal back in Liverpool's favour in one of the wildest games Anfield has arguably ever witnessed.
