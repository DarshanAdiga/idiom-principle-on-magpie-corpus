La Comisión de Cambios, integrada por la Secretaría de Hacienda y el Banco de México, subastó coberturas cambiarias liquidables en pesos, por un monto de 2,000 millones de dólares, a tres horas del inicio de operaciones del mercado mexicano.


  Sin embargo, sólo cuatro postores se presentaron y demandaron 460 millones de dólares en coberturas: 430 millones a un mes y 30 millones a dos meses. En un comunicado, las autoridades financieras precisaron que el objetivo de esta subasta de inicio es propiciar mejores condiciones de liquidez y un funcionamiento ordenado del mercado.


  El monto a subastar forma parte de los 30,000 millones de dólares que fijaron como límite para garantizar liquidez en caso de que se presenten episodios de alta volatilidad.


  En la primera asignación de forwards cambiarios a un plazo de 30 días, cuyo vencimiento es el 16 de abril, se colocaron 430 millones de dólares. Sólo se presentaron cinco postores y se colocaron a un tipo de cambio ponderado de 21.73 pesos por unidad, lo que indica que las instituciones que participaron esperan que dentro de un mes, el dólar cotizará debajo de 22 pesos, donde llegó a ubicarse al detonarse la subasta. En la segunda operación se ofrecieron otros 500 millones de dólares con vencimiento a tres meses. El monto total asignado fue de 30 millones de dólares, se recibieron cuatro posturas y la colocación se realizó un tipo de cambio ponderado de 21.69 pesos.

  Anthony, New Mexico, is a mere crow's flight from El Paso, Texas, my point of origin. Anthony is where my group from the Society of American Travel Writers stopped to enjoy a meaty and chili-spice-centric luncheon on a ranch known for its pecan orchard. Our adventure was billed as Borderland Eats, with a first stop to Seco Spice to tour the chili pepper factory.   Capsaicin-rich chili peppers and similar spices like smoked paprika are prevalent indigenous ingredients in the cuisine of the Mexican border region but are used and enjoyed everywhere.   We took a van to Seco Spice, a large organic chili pepper producer and supplier. Before we left El Paso, Chef Oscar Herrera hopped aboard the van to share a bit of local background and history on our impending lunch.   Herrera's passion about cooking began at an early age, thanks to his family, and to Julia Child, whose TV cooking show he watched with awe. Herrera is best known for opening Flor de Nogal, a top-ranked restaurant in neighboring Juarez, Mexico, as well as Taft-Diaz in the Stanton House in El Paso.   Interestingly, Taft-Diaz restaurant is named after U.S. President William H. Taft and Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. Back in 1909, the two leaders met to resolve a dispute over a 600-acre plot of land called El Chamizal, which was created by a shift in the Rio Grande River near California, discovered by surveyors.   Chef intro and history lesson complete, face masks and hair nets were distributed to all of us as we arrived at Seco Spice -- before we stepped outside to be met by the olfactory punch of smoked chili pepper. This visit to a fourth-generation-owned chili pepper factory proved especially memorable to my sinuses, and I hadn't yet entered the building! Once inside, breathing was labored, even with the mask, but I was on a mission to see fresh paprika produced.   Agronomist and Harvest Manager Lucas Ogac explained that Seco's chili pepper smoking process takes place in nearby Chihuahua, Mexico, because there they're able to smoke using mesquite wood; in the U.S., paprika is often \"smoked\" using chemicals. So, the chili peppers are grown and harvested in New Mexico, shipped over the border for smoking, then returned to this New Mexico facility to be dried and ground.   The harvesting and sorting of the peppers is time-sensitive and laborious. The farm's laborers pick only from 6 to 9 a.m. and then call it a day, due to temperatures hovering around 100 degrees. Pickers are paid between 90 cents and $2 per bucket. Every four days, close to 1,000 pounds of peppers are bagged after they're picked, dehydrated and milled in steel vats. The spices are then packaged and sold to a variety of chain restaurants, including Taco Bell.   My sinuses were grateful to learn that green chilis, ghost peppers (deemed the deadliest peppers to digest) and habaneros were picked the week prior to our tour.   Watching paprika being produced made everyone in our group hungry for lunch. When we arrived at our lunch spot, however, a ranch a 10-minute drive away from the spice factory, we were put to task at an outdoor table to prepare the cactus salad and Hatch chile corn (off the cob) while Chef Herrera and his team smoked short ribs, sausages and a whole suckling pig to make carne asada.   We dutifully prepped, then toured the ranch, where horses and miniature ponies frolicked behind a posted fence. The ranch is surrounded by nine acres of orchard planted with pecan trees whose trunks are submerged in water as the method of irrigation. These trees produce up to 20,000 pounds of nuts annually, which are harvested in late December and sourced to Whole Foods Markets in El Paso and Albuquerque, some bakeries in Colorado and Utah, and as far north as Idaho.   By the time our tour concluded, lunch was finally ready and served family- style, accompanied by tumblers of margaritas. We dined with abandon, amazed by the flavors and by the culinary collaboration that brings these smoky spices across the borders of two countries and two states: Mexico and the U.S.; El Paso, Texas, and Anthony, New Mexico.

BOISE — A plan to address rising property tax rates by temporarily freezing or capping local government tax revenues died on the Senate floor Thursday.


  The 24-11 vote means lawmakers could adjourn for the year without providing any tax relief, despite months of complaints from homeowners across the state.


  As initially proposed by House Majority Leader Mike Moyle, R-Star, the bill would have prohibited all non-school taxing districts from collecting more in property taxes next year than they do this year.


  While that wouldn’t necessarily result in lower property tax bills for individual homeowners, he said, it would delay as much as $132 million in property tax increases statewide, providing overall relief.


  The intent of the one-year freeze, Moyle said, was to bring cities and counties to the table to work on a permanent solution to the problem.


  The bill passed the House on a 46-23 vote. However, after vocal complaints from cities and counties, the Senate changed the freeze to a 4 percent cap on property tax revenues, for up to three years.


  The Senate debated the amended bill for nearly an hour Thursday.


  Sen. Jim Rice, R-Caldwell, likened homeowners to the proverbial camel with the broken back.


  “We have thousands of taxing districts that all look at the good things they can do (with this tax revenue), and they’re all loading that onto the camel,” Rice said. “By itself, their load seems reasonable — but when you add all the loads together, the citizen, who is the camel, gets a broken back.”


  Several senators, though, felt the legislation failed to provide timely tax relief, and might actually exacerbate the problem.


  Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, noted that bill prohibits local governments from accruing any “foregone” taxes — meaning if they levied less than a 4 percent increase, they couldn’t save the difference for future years, as is now the case.


  “The concern I have is that there’s little or no incentive for local taxing districts to take less than the 4 percent,” he said. “They’d almost have to protect themselves by taking the maximum amount, because they couldn’t put (the difference) into foregone. So we’re just raising taxes on homeowners.”


  A companion measure to create an interim committee to review and recommend solutions to the property tax issue has already been approved.


  That wasn’t much comfort for Sen. Mark Nye, D-Pocatello.


  “That’s just kicking the can down the road,” he said. “It’s another study. In my area, a lot of people don’t have a can to kick. They can’t wait three years. We need to do something now.”


  Democrats have been pushing all session for an increase in the homeowner exemption, as well as the circuit breaker, which provides a property tax break of up to $1,320 for seniors, disabled veterans and other low-income individuals.


  “We have things we could have done to mitigate (the problem),” said Sen. David Nelson, D-Moscow. “For whatever reason, we haven’t moved forward with them.”


  None of the bills could get an introductory hearing.


  That may soon change, though. Senate President Pro Tem Brent Hill, R-Rexburg, suggested this week that circuit breaker and homeowner exemption bills could still be introduced this session.


  Sen. Carl Crabtree, R-Grangeville, supported the freeze bill; Sens. Nelson and Dan Johnson, R-Lewiston, opposed it.


  “A lot of taxing districts will be impacted by this,” Johnson said. “I don’t have enough information from them or any analysis that makes me feel comfortable supporting this bill.”

Dutton's statement said that he has been admitted to hospital, in accordance with the advice of authorities in his home state of Queensland.


  The minister woke up on Friday morning with a temperature and sore throat and immediately contacted Queensland's health department, he said. He was tested for COVID-19 and was advise on Friday afternoon that he had tested positive.


  "I feel fine and will provide an update in due course," Dutton's statement said.


  As the minister overseeing the vast home affairs portfolio, Dutton is one of the most powerful members of the government.


  He is one of eight members of the National Security Committee of Cabinet, which has been meeting regularly to guide Australia's response to the global pandemic. The committee also includes the prime minister, Scott Morrison, deputy prime minister, attorney-general and treasurer.


  Australia's federal cabinet most recently met on Tuesday. On Friday evening, a spokesperson for Morrison's office said neither Morrison nor any other members of the cabinet needed to self isolate as a result of contact with Dutton.


  The deputy chief medical officer had advised that only people who had contact with Dutton in the 24 hours before he showed symptoms of the virus needed to self-isolate, the spokesperson said.


  Dutton had recently travelled to the United States for a meeting of senior government members of the Five Eyes, an international intelligence alliance. He met with Ivanka Trump on March 6, according to a tweet from the Australian embassy.

European markets fell 12% in one of their worst days ever, even after the European Central Bank pledged to buy more bonds and offer more help for the economy.


  "Between the lack of a strong US fiscal response and the latest travel ban for arrivals from Europe to the US, global markets appear to have been tipped over into a sell-everything mode," Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.


  Overriding concerns about the actual impact on business and trade is pessimism over how the crisis is being handled, with the "sum of all fears are culminating with the view that policymakers remain well behind the curve", said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp.


  Not all markets have suffered equally, but many are down by double-digits from just weeks earlier.


  Thailand's SET has lost nearly 40% and the Philippines' benchmark is down more than 30%.


  Despite the slight improvements in some markets, gloom prevailed in Asia on Friday, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 down 6.1% to 17,431.05. The Kospi in South Korea sank 3.6% to 1,769.81,


  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng lost 3.8% to 23,377.07. Shares fell in Southeast Asia.


  Stocks fell so fast on Wall Street at Thursday's opening bell that they triggered an automatic, 15-minute trading halt for the second time this week. The so-called circuit breakers were first adopted after the 1987 crash, and until this week hadn't been tripped since 1997.

BOISE — The joint budget committee took another stab at several agency budgets Thursday, crafting slightly modified proposals after the initial versions died on the House floor.


  The committee approved new fiscal 2021 budgets for colleges and universities, as well as the state treasurer, secretary of state and attorney general.


  As originally written, the higher education budget called for a $25.6 million, 4.23 percent increase compared to the current year. That was $1.7 million more than the governor’s recommendation.


  That bill died Monday on a 37-32 vote. Some lawmakers objected to exceeding the governor’s recommendation. Several also suggested the institutions are spending too much money on executive salaries, diversity efforts at Boise State University and other areas that didn’t directly address state workforce needs.


  The budget committee’s new version of the bill cut $400,600 out of the budget, for an overall increase of 4.16 percent. Almost all of that came through a reduction in occupancy costs for BSU.


  Occupancy costs are funds the institutions receive to cover operating and maintenance costs for new buildings.


  If approved, the new version of the budget would steer an additional $837,700 to Lewis-Clark State College, over and above the governor’s recommendation. That’s unchanged from the bill that failed on the House floor.


  Minor modifications were also made to the treasure, secretary of state and attorney general budgets. All four bills must now pass the House and the Senate, and be signed by the governor.

FXStreet considers that regardless of the situation, users are always the affected party - being the sudden disappearance of an unregulated broker - or the potential prompt shutdown of the OTA "In our 20 years in the market, we have always cared about the trader, relentlessly vouching for education and to keep on empowering our users. Trading is a risky activity, and the more you learn about trading, the better decisions you may take - and even with enhanced knowledge, success is never guaranteed." Setxi Fernandez, CEO at FXStreet.com stated. "Traders often believe that operating in markets can help become rich easily, and unfortunately, this is not the case. Trading requires practice, effort, and familiarity with markets". Following their firm belief in the importance of education and their commitment to traders, FXStreet has decided to launch the FXS Trading Institute to offer all OTA users a chance to continue with their education on fxstreet.com. The education leading portal has created over 20 weekly live-webinars to help users continue their training. The topics covered in the webinars are Forex (4 sessions a week), Stocks (4 sessions a week), Futures (4 sessions a week), Options (4 sessions a week), Long Term strategies (2 sessions a week) and a special weekly session. FXS Trading Institute is not limited to webinars, but also offers dedicated monitoring and many years of experience in the market to back it up. So far, experts including Jose Blasco have already joined this FXStreet initiative, with more to come on board soon. To round this up and to show their devotion to traders, this service will be free of charge for three months for users registered in OTA training programs, with no obligation to continue once this complimentary period is over. All the details and the signup form arehere.

  WILMINGTON -- Since its development nearly 300 years ago, women have been the backbone of the Cape Fear region.


  Although history is often viewed through the lens of achievements of men, women have worked tirelessly to hold down the homefront during times of war, raised the next generation at home, and spent decades striving to break into fields of work, leadership and acclaim that were once reserved for men.


  With Women's History Month in full swing, the Cape Fear Unearthed local history podcast is turning its attention to the lives of women who helped define and redefine progress in Southeastern North Carolina.


  Joining this week's special episode is Cape Fear Museum historian Jan Davidson, who stops by to share the stories of several women who made incredible strides in politics, education and the community as a whole in the 20th century.


  The episode, which is available to stream now, includes discussions of Katherine Mayo Cowan, Wilmington's first (and still only) woman to be mayor; Augusta Mosley Cooper, the first black woman to run for city council; Marie Galloway, one of the first women to be hired as a crossing guard; and Kate Brewer, the first woman to break into the Wilmington police force.


  In 2020, Cape Fear Unearthed will debut new episodes every two weeks, each of which will explore a new chapter from Southeastern North Carolina's history books.


  Recent episodes have recounted the history of Scottish Higlanders in the region, the legacy of the Cape Fear Indians, the devastating Wrightsville Beach fire of 1934, and the monumental histories of Fort Fisher and Fort Anderson.


  The entire catalog of episodes is available to stream for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, iHeartRadio, Stitcher and TuneIn.


  You also can listen to every episode of the podcast at CapeFearUnearthed.com, which features other local history content and historic photo galleries compiled by the StarNews.


  Listeners can also join the Cape Fear Unearthed Facebook group to stay up to date on extra content for each episode and upcoming events across the region. You can find that group by searching \"Cape Fear Unearthed\" on Facebook.

POTTSTOWN — Sly Fox Brewing and Manatawny Still works have collaborated on two new beverages — a beer and a whiskey — that have been making their debut during the last week. The official release party happens on Saturday, March 14.


  The collaboration between the two companies has been in the works for a couple of years. Max Pfeffer used to be a brewer at Sly Fox, but moved over to Manatawny Still Works as head distiller when that business opened in Pottstown in 2014.


  “I wanted to do the collaboration because we’re neighbors, we have a close relationship and it just made sense,” Pfeffer said. Both businesses are located on Circle of Progress Drive in Pottstown — Sly Fox at 331 and Manatawny at 320.

BOISE — Concerns about the coronavirus haven’t prompted any changes at the Idaho Legislature yet, although it is ramping up the pressure to adjourn next week.


  As of Thursday afternoon, there hasn’t been a confirmed case of the COVID-19 virus in Idaho. That’s expected to change, though, as people continue to move around the country and as more tests are done.


  Gov. Brad Little will hold a news conference at 9 a.m. PDT today to provide an update on steps the state is taking to protect citizens.


  House and Senate leaders have been meeting with the governor on a daily basis to get updates on the virus. They’ve discussed a number of scenarios, but the plan right now is to keep driving toward a March 20 adjournment date.


  That was the goal before the coronavirus ever arrived in the United States.


  “We’d be pushing hard (for March 20), anyway, but this just makes the urgency more clear,” said House Majority Leader Mike Moyle, R-Star. “It needs to happen.”


  The virus is one more factor that adds to the normal end-of-session urgency, along with the current uncertainty in financial markets, the upcoming election season and the onset of spring.


  “There’s always a sense of urgency (to be done before April), but that’s heightened now because of the virus and the financial uncertainty,” said House Speaker Scott Bedke, R-Oakley.


  The most likely scenario, he said, is that the Legislature completes its work next week, as planned, without any need to consider “Plan B.”


  If someone in the Statehouse is diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to that, Bedke said, leadership has discussed restricting public access to the Statehouse.


  “We might have to suspend tours of the Capitol and limit nonessential personnel,” he said.


  The U.S. Capitol also suspended public tours Thursday, until April 1.


  Sending lawmakers home early would likely be a last resort. A number of budget bills still have to be approved, “and we have a looming property tax issue that needs to be addressed,” Bedke said.


  Progress on either of those issues has been a bit tenuous of late. The House has killed five budget bills over the last few days — including the college and university budget. The House Education Committee on Thursday also expressed opposition to the public schools budget, which transfers most information technology functions from the State Department of Education to the State Board of Education. That budget could be taken up on the House floor as early as today.


  The Senate added to the end-of-session confusion as well, when it killed a property tax freeze bill on a 24-11 vote (see related story, Page 1A).


  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Winder, R-Boise, said the Legislature can’t adjourn until it completes all the budget bills. Unlike the Washington Legislature — which adjourned its 60-day session on Thursday, as scheduled — Idaho doesn’t have the ability for lawmakers to vote remotely.


  “Until there’s a confirmed case that directly impacts (the Statehouse), I think we keep working,” Winder said.

“Devastating. Stunning,” UCLA coach John Savage said. “I feel for all the players. I feel for the coaches. I feel for all the programs that work so hard through the fall and January, and to have such a decision to go down so quickly is just really hard to imagine. I feel for the seniors across the country. It’s just a really, really sad day.”


  The eight-team College World Series is held each year at TD Ameritrade Park and is the culmination of the Division I baseball tournament, the No. 2 revenue producer for the NCAA. The event draws more than 300,000 fans per year from across the country and is one of Omaha’s most anticipated events of the year.


  NCAA President Mark Emmert and the Board of Governors canceled the Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments as well as all remaining winter and spring NCAA championships because of the public health threat posed by the spread of the new coronavirus.


  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus.


  The wrestling championships were to be held March 19-21 at 60,000-seat U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. It was going to be the first time the event was held in a football stadium, and the total attendance record of 113,743 was expected to be shattered.


  The women’s ice hockey tournament was scheduled to end March 20 and 22 in Boston, and the men’s Frozen Four was set for April 9 and 11 in Detroit.


  Besides the College World Series, the top spring sport championships canceled were the men’s and women’s track and field June 10-13 in Austin, Texas; softball’s Women’s College World Series May 28-June 3 in Oklahoma City; men’s lacrosse final four May 28 and 30 in East Hartford, Connecticut; and the women’s lacrosse championship May 22 and 24 in Baltimore.


  The NCAA’s decision applies only to championship events. Individual conferences and schools can decide for themselves whether they want to continue their regular seasons.


  The Big Ten, following the Ivy League’s move on Wednesday, announced there would be no more spring sport competitions this year. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Pac-12 suspended competition indefinitely, and the Big 12 and Southeastern Conference suspended play until the end of the month.


  The Pac-12’s Stanford announced separately that its winter and spring sports teams are done for the season.


  ESPN college baseball analyst Kyle Peterson, who grew up in Omaha and pitched for Stanford in the CWS in 1995 and ‘97, said the NCAA’s decision to cancel the College World Series was rash.


  “I don’t understand why we’re canceling something that at this point is 3 1/2 months out,” Peterson said. “That, to me, I disagree with. I don’t disagree with the concern associated with this because I think it’s entirely warranted. Anything for the next 30-60 days, whatever the time frame is that we can understand what we’re dealing with, that’s what we all need to do as a country. Middle of June seemed unnecessary at this point.”


  Jack Diesing Jr., chairman of the local organizing committee for the College World Series, said it was a prudent decision by the NCAA considering there is regional and super regional competition in the two weeks leading to the CWS.


  “In order to qualify, you have to travel around and play games and people are going to be there,” Diesing said. “Out of an abundance of caution, let’s not take any chances of unduly exposing the student-athlete or the fans to potential sickness.”

The Pac-12 followed suit of the NCAA and other major conferences by canceling the tournament on Thursday.


  With a few thousand fans in the stands, the 11th-seeded Cougars (16-16) jumped on Colorado and didn’t let up, quickly turning the final game of the tournament into a rout.


  Elleby led the way, hitting 6 of 10 from 3-point range, with 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals.


  Washington State made 10 of 21 from the 3-point arc and shut down Colorado defensively.


  “We’ll have to bring our own energy,” Elleby said.


  The sixth-seeded Buffaloes shot 37% and went 4 for 21 from 3-point range. McKinley Wright IV had 21 points and Tyler Bey 19.


  Colorado won the team’s lone meeting 78-56 by pulling away in the second half.


  The Buffaloes came out cold along The Strip, missing 12 of their first 16 shots as Washington State built a 27-13 lead midway through the first half.


  Elleby led Washington State’s early charge.


  The all-conference sophomore forward had a forgettable final weekend of the regular season, shooting a combined 6 for 33 — 1 for 14 from 3-point range — in losses to the Arizona schools.


  Elleby was confident and on the mark against Colorado, scoring 13 points in the first 10 1/2 minutes. He had 15 points to give Washington State a 35-25 halftime lead. Colorado missed all eight of its 3-point attempts in the first half.


  Elleby hit two quick 3-pointers and Isaac Bonton hit another to stretch the Cougars’ lead to 44-26 early in the second half. Colorado scored nine straight points midway through the second half, but that only cut the lead to 57-45.

Anthony, New Mexico, is a mere crow's flight from El Paso, Texas, my point of origin. Anthony is where my group from the Society of American Travel Writers stopped to enjoy a meaty and chili-spice-centric luncheon on a ranch known for its pecan orchard. Our adventure was billed as Borderland Eats, with a first stop to Seco Spice to tour the chili pepper factory.   Capsaicin-rich chili peppers and similar spices like smoked paprika are prevalent indigenous ingredients in the cuisine of the Mexican border region but are used and enjoyed everywhere.   We took a van to Seco Spice, a large organic chili pepper producer and supplier. Before we left El Paso, Chef Oscar Herrera hopped aboard the van to share a bit of local background and history on our impending lunch.   Herrera's passion about cooking began at an early age, thanks to his family, and to Julia Child, whose TV cooking show he watched with awe. Herrera is best known for opening Flor de Nogal, a top-ranked restaurant in neighboring Juarez, Mexico, as well as Taft-Diaz in the Stanton House in El Paso.   Interestingly, Taft-Diaz restaurant is named after U.S. President William H. Taft and Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. Back in 1909, the two leaders met to resolve a dispute over a 600-acre plot of land called El Chamizal, which was created by a shift in the Rio Grande River near California, discovered by surveyors.   Chef intro and history lesson complete, face masks and hair nets were distributed to all of us as we arrived at Seco Spice -- before we stepped outside to be met by the olfactory punch of smoked chili pepper. This visit to a fourth-generation-owned chili pepper factory proved especially memorable to my sinuses, and I hadn't yet entered the building! Once inside, breathing was labored, even with the mask, but I was on a mission to see fresh paprika produced.   Agronomist and Harvest Manager Lucas Ogac explained that Seco's chili pepper smoking process takes place in nearby Chihuahua, Mexico, because there they're able to smoke using mesquite wood; in the U.S., paprika is often "smoked" using chemicals. So, the chili peppers are grown and harvested in New Mexico, shipped over the border for smoking, then returned to this New Mexico facility to be dried and ground.   The harvesting and sorting of the peppers is time-sensitive and laborious. The farm's laborers pick only from 6 to 9 a.m. and then call it a day, due to temperatures hovering around 100 degrees. Pickers are paid between 90 cents and $2 per bucket. Every four days, close to 1,000 pounds of peppers are bagged after they're picked, dehydrated and milled in steel vats. The spices are then packaged and sold to a variety of chain restaurants, including Taco Bell.   My sinuses were grateful to learn that green chilis, ghost peppers (deemed the deadliest peppers to digest) and habaneros were picked the week prior to our tour.   Watching paprika being produced made everyone in our group hungry for lunch. When we arrived at our lunch spot, however, a ranch a 10-minute drive away from the spice factory, we were put to task at an outdoor table to prepare the cactus salad and Hatch chile corn (off the cob) while Chef Herrera and his team smoked short ribs, sausages and a whole suckling pig to make carne asada.   We dutifully prepped, then toured the ranch, where horses and miniature ponies frolicked behind a posted fence. The ranch is surrounded by nine acres of orchard planted with pecan trees whose trunks are submerged in water as the method of irrigation. These trees produce up to 20,000 pounds of nuts annually, which are harvested in late December and sourced to Whole Foods Markets in El Paso and Albuquerque, some bakeries in Colorado and Utah, and as far north as Idaho.   By the time our tour concluded, lunch was finally ready and served family- style, accompanied by tumblers of margaritas. We dined with abandon, amazed by the flavors and by the culinary collaboration that brings these smoky spices across the borders of two countries and two states: Mexico and the U.S.; El Paso, Texas, and Anthony, New Mexico.

A coronial inquest initially concluded Johnson died by suicide. But another inquest in 2017 found he had likely fallen victim to "actual or threatened" gay-hate violence.


  In 2018 the NSW government announced a $1 million reward for information in the case. On Tuesday, the victim's brother Steve Johnson matched that amount, doubling it to $2 million.


  Detective Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans has now told the _Sydney Morning Herald_ the investigation had narrowed in on a "particular individual".


  "Since [the reward increase] in December 2018, we've received an incredible amount of information from the community," he said.


  "We identified and revisited information relating to people who were known to have a specific bias around the time of Scott Johnson’s death."


  Chief Inspector Yeomans said those involved in Scott Johnson's death "may have bragged" about the events.


  "This has led us to some very specific lines of inquiry, with our current focus on a particular individual," he said.


  ## Scott Johnson's brother thanks 'clearly dedicated' team of police


  Steve Johnson told the _Herald_ the NSW Police's revelation had left him emotional yet hopeful.


  "This is the first time they have ever said that. It was very emotional, to tell you the truth," he said.


  "To go for so long with an intransigent police force, totally uninterested in investigating my brother's death as a homicide, to a team clearly dedicated to solving it."


  Steve Johnson said he became aware of "progress" in February and asked how he could help.


  "That's when I proposed that I be the one to raise the reward to $2 million," he said.

WILMINGTON -- Since its development nearly 300 years ago, women have been the backbone of the Cape Fear region.


   


  Although history is often viewed through the lens of achievements of men, women have worked tirelessly to hold down the homefront during times of war, raised the next generation at home, and spent decades striving to break into fields of work, leadership and acclaim that were once reserved for men.


   


  With Women's History Month in full swing, the Cape Fear Unearthed local history podcast is turning its attention to the lives of women who helped define and redefine progress in Southeastern North Carolina.


   


  Joining this week's special episode is Cape Fear Museum historian Jan Davidson, who stops by to share the stories of several women who made incredible strides in politics, education and the community as a whole in the 20th century.


   


  The episode, which is available to stream now, includes discussions of Katherine Mayo Cowan, Wilmington's first (and still only) woman to be mayor; Augusta Mosley Cooper, the first black woman to run for city council; Marie Galloway, one of the first women to be hired as a crossing guard; and Kate Brewer, the first woman to break into the Wilmington police force.


   


  In 2020, Cape Fear Unearthed will debut new episodes every two weeks, each of which will explore a new chapter from Southeastern North Carolina's history books.


   


  Recent episodes have recounted the history of Scottish Higlanders in the region, the legacy of the Cape Fear Indians, the devastating Wrightsville Beach fire of 1934, and the monumental histories of Fort Fisher and Fort Anderson.


   


  The entire catalog of episodes is available to stream for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, iHeartRadio, Stitcher and TuneIn.


   


  You also can listen to every episode of the podcast at CapeFearUnearthed.com, which features other local history content and historic photo galleries compiled by the StarNews.


   


  Listeners can also join the Cape Fear Unearthed Facebook group to stay up to date on extra content for each episode and upcoming events across the region. You can find that group by searching "Cape Fear Unearthed" on Facebook.
