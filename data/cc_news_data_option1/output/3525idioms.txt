A few days after increment in pump price of fuel and electricity tariff, citizens of Osun State are now in great lamentations towards the unbearable hardship that the hike has caused. As some were accusing the Federal Government of being inconsiderate and inhuman, others blasted it for its insensitivity saying, despite the strangulated, shattered and battered economy, it still went ahead to inflict agony on the souls and bodies of its citizens. One of them, who identified himself as Mr. Adebisi Abifarin, pointed out that it is de-rating downgrading and shameful for the government to have increased the price of the essential commodities which it knows are necessary to all and sundry.

When they crowded around my table and started demanding that I raise my fist, it was their insistence that I participate in something that I did not understand that led me to withhold my hand.

That’s what we do in a democracy.

It's way outta control. Every night there's one. They've got to start going through proper channels if they really care (like with the TR statue) and stop the random vandalism and calling the media to come see their performance....

So several things are at work here. First, I'm assuming while the CNN host is a busy man, he must have watched Pelosi's appearance on MSNBC after she got the wash-and-blow.

However, when quizzed on Phillips' chances of starting on Saturday against Iceland, Southgate appeared to pour cold water on the prospects of seeing him the initial XI.
 "The nice thing is that we have eight matches across the autumn and in an ideal world you would bring players in to help and settle into the group and adapt to the way that we play," Southgate told the press ahead of their Nations League clash with Iceland.
 "He has a really, really clearly defined role with his club and in any club you can play as a midfield pivot but there are slightly different requirements in any team.
 "I think for him to be able to work with the other players, be comfortable socially with the group, they have welcomed him really well and he has constantly got a smile on his face and is a really engaging character.

We live double lives. Mild-mannered columnists by day. Rescuers of damsels in distress by night. A real pain when you can't see where you're going. So as a faint glow illuminated our path while on a daring raid with Boofalo Bill -- we invariably called him that -- we couldn't resist exclaiming, "Avast! Ahoy!" We always use nautical terminology while on the prairie. "Above yon trees! See the pale moon rise!" We pointed dramatically. And up came the moon.
   
 Only to become entangled in the sheet that doubled as an artificial horizon and crash to the floor below.
   
 Muffled curses emanated from behind the curtain as stagehands worked frantically to reattach the moon to the hoisting apparatus. Another crash. Poor damsel. They just don't make moons like they used to. Years passed. And then the flawless ascent. Followed by Boofalo Bill's deadpan response -- both true to the script and completely apropos -- which brought down the house.
   
 "God pray we're in time."
   
 None of it would have happened had we not chosen Adrian College and the liberal arts education it provided. We weren't master thespians. Indeed, theatrical productions -- malfunctioning props and all -- were far removed from our majors. But we're forever grateful for the cornucopia of options that broadened our horizons. Even those that resembled a close encounter of the Murphy's Law kind.
   
 What a drab four years had we never graced the stage. Or debated into the wee hours of the morning whether Friedrich Nietzsche actually existed or if we only perceived that he did. And what was the true reality of life anyway? From a scholarly exploration of world religions to smuggling draft dodgers onto campus for live radio interviews, then spiriting them away before The Heat found out, our lives were immeasurably enriched by disciplines that, had they not been required, we might easily have ignored.
   
 So we got pretty hot under the collar last week when we learned our alma mater had put its history, theater, religion, philosophy, and leadership departments -- Japanese studies, too -- on the Big Brother chopping block, insinuating they were relics of "the days of old" that did not reflect "the type of innovative future we envision."
   
 Or in laymen's terms, why waste time on Hamlet when you can reel in a largemouth bass instead?
   
 It didn't set too well with alumni, friends of the college, faculty and staff either. They quickly mobilized into a force several thousand strong, determined to win the power of veto. Whether due solely to their passionate advocacy -- or maybe a few high rolling-donors threatening to cut off the gravy train -- by Tuesday afternoon the administration had rescinded the departmental layoff notices, issued an apology, and pledged to seek other ways to balance the budget in the year ahead.
   
 In other words, a short-term reprieve.
   
 We're proud of the pressure the group brought to bear. And trust in their continued vigilance, lest the change of heart prove only an attempt to mollify the masses till the heat blows over. The college faithful need good watchdogs standing guard. Otherwise Pac-Man Activities may still replace Hegel and Kant.
   
 And Beer Pong 101 and Introductory Corn Hole become Freshman Core's foundational elements.
   
 Not that college should be devoid of sports and fun. After all, we won the Cargo Hall Sure-Shot hockey tournament two years running. But the primary focus should be stretching your mind and challenging your thinking. Not replacing the parsing of parables with rowing the boat ashore. Unless you're named Michael. Then be sure to say hallelujah a time or two while plying the oars.
   
 So the college retains its church-affiliated status.

The state as a whole is just not liberal! Just not a world that fits in any shape or form. They like their Democrats sensible, down to earth, not liberal, Reagan Dem style though not as hard and fast as Michigan. Joe does fit the bill I've got to say. Plenty of them voted for Obama both times, another sensible, not liberal type of guy. The "no drama" thing a big plus as well I would imagine.

These aren't the locals, some who might act out violently, just once out of mob anger. These are regulars, purposely inciting. I see Mayor Bowser and her police chief just talked about "outside agitators" on Monday. Read similar from Denver, Kenosha, Richmond,etc. There's groups of them traveling to wherever they can cause trouble, they form something similar to a flash mob via text, they convert a few kids permanently with their passion and romance of it all who join the club and travel to protests or keep the faith on home turf. Send in fed goons like Trump did to Portland, they especially love that, the imagined fascists become real, the fight they dream of is hastened.

As for Milwaukee blacks, a reminder that this is their world, and Milwaukee city & county and surrounding burbs are already as about as divisive as one could get segregation wise before Trump was in the picture. Like total segregation. And both sides enable it to the max. The black culture would get any disinfo. word of mouth, or from celebs they are fans of, not so much from political internet. There's two cultures there in Milwaukee and they do not mix. Any blacks who manage to get a good education and avoid prison or multiple pregnancy while young get out and go elsewhere.
