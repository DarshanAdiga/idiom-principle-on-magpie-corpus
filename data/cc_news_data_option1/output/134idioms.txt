This led to a thawing of the relationship with Iran reaping the economic bounty as the unlocking of assets frozen by the Americans led the Iranian economy to grow by twelve percent. Why would the Iranians prefer this peace and growing prosperity with confrontation and hostility with America abroad? This is what has led some distinguished American commentators to naively dismiss Soleimani as an overrated military and political strategist.

A trailer burned in rural Maury County when the eight round hay bales it carried caught fire this week.
   
 The Maury County Fire Department was dispatched to the scene near the intersection of Campbelsville Pike and Sequoya Trail south of Columbia on Thursday.
   
 Due to the traffic issues the fire was causing a MCFD brush truck was used to pull the trailer onto Sequoya Trail where the fire could be better managed by the firefighters.
   
 Those hauling the bales were able to disconnect the trailer and pull their truck away as the fire grew, illuminating the dark rural road.
   
 "Hay is nearly impossible to extinguish so units set up positive pressure fans and used a leaf blower to expedite the process of burning the bales up," a statement from the department read.
   
 The responding units led by Assistant Chief Jose Periut were at the scene for almost three hours.
   
 There were no injuries reported.
   
 The Maury County Fire Department is a volunteer organization with about 150 to 200 volunteer firefighters.
   
 The department operates from 12 stations scattered across Maury County's 620 square miles of land inhabited by about 100,000 people using 10 engines, five tanker trucks, five brush trucks, a mobile air unit and six support vehicles.
   
 Maury County is one of the largest counties in the state in land mass.
   
 In 2019, MCFD responded to a total of 974 calls. Of those calls, 48%, a total of 464 calls, involved rescue and medical responses.
   
 The department also responded to a total of 154 fires.

The biggest upshot may be on the streets, though. An attempted gangland hit of a Bagdad member took place in the Panama City neighborhood of Barraza three days before the La Joyita massacre, there was a more successful hit in Barraza the day the prison blew up, and since that day there have been at least a dozen other gang-style killings, mostly in the Bagdad stronghold of Arraijan. All the circumstances point to a split or purge in Bagdad, for reasons not explained to those out of the loop.

To soothe its injured pride and ego, Iran has been allowed to unleash its furious missiles on a safe designated area. America has been able to get away with assassination, leaving the rest to proxy warriors.

DANNY MURPHY: Liverpool are so classy, Tottenham simply had to play it safe | Daily Mail Online

Veloce è arrivata una mezza smentita, basata sul fatto che già esiste un progenitore, lo SPID (sistema di identità digitale), che permette già di accedere a diverse amministrazioni. La differenza tra i due stadi è notevole, però. L’accenno della ministra evoca un ruolo di coordinamento e di “garanzia” da parte dello Stato. Facile temere un “Grande fratello” all’italiana, dove improvvisazione e faciloneria potrebbero risultare non meno insidiose dei progetti dei professionisti del Male, naviganti in incognito nel villaggio globale. Al riguardo si suggerisce a Paola Pisano, del resto supportata da un curriculum serio, di leggere o rileggere “Il capitalismo della sorveglianza” (2019, ed Luiss) della docente di Harvard Shoshana Zuboff, recensito sul “il manifesto” lo scorso 4 ottobre dall’indimenticabile Benedetto Vecchi. Il quadro analizzato dalla studiosa è terribile e chiaro nello stesso tempo: il controllo capillare delle nostre vite non è una devianza, bensì la fisiologia del capitalismo delle piattaforme. Il riconoscimento dei profili dei cittadini-sudditi e l’intrusione nelle esistenze private sono essenziali per scegliere l segmenti di mercato redditizi, per influenzare il clima di opinione e spostare le appartenenze politiche. Il caso di “Cambridge Analytica” è un ammonimento brutale. E importanti elezioni sono imminenti. Quindi, prima di azzardarsi a immaginare scenari da “algocrazia”, è bene condurre un’istruttoria adeguata. Vi sono in Italia esperti stimatissimi, indipendenti dagli “Over The Top”. Purtroppo, ai vari Google, Amazon, Facebook si ricorre, invece, per approntare schemi e modelli operativi. In Spagna diventa giustamente ministro il celeberrimo Manuel Castells. Senza enfasi, da noi lavorano e insegnano personalità omologhe.

There is no military that does not have a few black sheep, but there are provisions to deal with them. Perhaps it is time the Nigerian military reassessed their training and doctrine manual, for the image problem they are contending with is feared to be more than what a few black sheep could cause. It is suspected that the problem has become systemic, and it is eating away at the heart of the military.
