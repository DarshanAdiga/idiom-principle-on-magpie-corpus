LANSING -- Students at universities across Michigan are receiving emails from their schools welcoming them back for the fall, but a cloud of concern is hovering because of the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 To go online or to come in person has been the debate, but since Michigan State University announced Tuesday it will go online for the next semester, the debate is reaching a fever pitch.
   
 "I just can't believe that they would wait this long. I would have changed around my whole plans," MSU transfer sophomore Sophia Kalakailo said after hearing the school's announcement.
   
 If the announcement had come any later, Kalakailo said she would have been stuck in a lease paying more than $500 a month to live near a campus where she won't take classes, which start Sept. 2.
   
 Michigan's 15 public universities have public COVID-19 mitigation plans. They include mandatory health checks and wearing symptom monitors. Though each plan is different, all include a mask requirement in campus buildings and a vow that the university will do its best to ensure student safety.
   
 University of Michigan doctoral student Ava M. Waller-Bey wonders how her school can ensure students' safety if classes are in-person. Students there must self isolate for 14 days before coming back to campus for classes Aug. 31, but the school offers no mention of enforcement.
   
 "I'm not sure what public health informed data and research that they're using to make that assertion that they can truly protect students, staff and faculty from a COVID outbreak," Waller-Bey said. "I do not know how you would enforce thousands of students quarantining for 14 days. I don't think it's possible, but I think what it does is put the onus and the burden on the students."
   
 Though students will not reap the benefits of in-person instruction at MSU or take part in the on-campus experience, the university president says the online education offered has the same value. Tuition is frozen for the 2020-21 school year.
   
 "Regardless of the format of instruction, MSU is delivering courses taught by highly qualified and world-class faculty, tutoring services, faculty office hours and access, academic advising and access to our libraries," President Samuel Stanley said in a media release. "The value of an MSU degree is significant and the modality of instruction does not reduce that value."
   
 Some students disagree.
   
 Tyler Weisner, a computer science senior now without access to labs and other on-campus resources, said he contacted multiple university offices seeking a tuition reduction without success. But he felt like he needed to do more so he started a petition demanding lower tuition. He sent it to the school Tuesday with nearly 1,000 signatures.
   
 The senior said it's obvious MSU doesn't prioritize upperclassmen since they can't take credits anywhere else and have them count toward their degree. Like many colleges, MSU limits what and how many credits students can transfer.
   
 "You're kind of like just trapped in this agreement where you're paying them money and they don't really have to care about you anymore." Weisner said.
   
 By not taking early action, Weisner said MSU locked in its most profitable age group, freshmen, who will pay tuition for typically four years.
   
 Eastern Michigan University hasn't shown any signs of following MSU's lead but Naiomi Wilson, who's in her last year of the combined athletic training program there, said she worries about the future of her education.
   
 Wilson said the nine people in her program are set to come in once a week to do in-person training necessary to begin careers. Because just nine people are in the program, she's not too worried that her classmates will not practice social distancing and take other precautions, but she has concerns for when the campus population comes back for classes Aug. 31.
   
 "There needs to be a little more consideration for certain groups of students, like nursing students. You're not learning nursing online," Wilson said. "It's just a little frustrating that I guess the responses are the same across the board when I don't necessarily know that they should be."
   
 MSU hasn't yet announced its plans for grad students and students in its osteopathic medicine, law and nursing schools.
   
 Being a parent of a student can be frustrating, too, said Michelle Rick, a judge in central Michigan and a mother of three college students. They are students at Saginaw Valley State University, Central Michigan University and MSU, facing issues like medical board exams postponed and difficulty with learning online.
   
 "We worry not about what are the choices that our kids make, but you can't necessarily control the decision making of other people," Rick said. "You're trusting that people are making the right choices."
   
 To ensure that students make the right choices and keep gatherings under 25 people, Ann Arbor police announced they will partner with the University of Michigan to enforce social distancing guidelines on the campus.
   
 Waller-Bey, the U-M doctoral student, said that with a national conversation taking place about over-policing of minorities, that decision "does not seem to read the room well."
   
 "The criminalization of behaviors that otherwise would be permissible under any other circumstance creates this strange police state that did not exist in this iteration, because the university has failed to make a decision that actually honors the lives of its students, its staff and the members and stakeholders in the university," Waller-Bey said.
   
 And she wonders what will happen to the custodians and other non-academic employees.
   
 "Who is really going to clean up the mess and I mean that literally?" Waller- Bey asked. "What are the ramifications for having these people be exposed to all these young people from all over? These universities have articulated commitments to equity and inclusion of diversity. Perhaps they only mean that for students and staff and faculty, but there are so many other important members of our university communities."

Holland is known for our lovely flowers, our Dutch history, great downtown shopping and, unfortunately, annual drownings.
   
 Every summer, especially on hot weekend days, The Sentinel's editors hope and pray we'll get through the day without any drownings -- or water rescues -- at Holland State Park or other beaches in our area.
   
 We are so tired of writing about children and young adults drowning. Every loss of life we write about at our newspaper is saddening, whether that death was the result of a car crash or fire or infectious disease. But drownings are a little different. They are 100 percent preventable. And because of that, each drowning we have to write about, each photo of someone whose life was snuffed out by the power of Lake Michigan, breaks our hearts.
   
 Holland is blessed by Mother Nature with some of the most beautiful lakeshore in the state, and people who grew up here know the rules.
   
 Look out for the flags at the state park. If they're red, that means stay out of the water no matter what. If you've got children in the water, don't take your eyes off them for a second. No matter how strong a swimmer you are, Lake Michigan doesn't care, she can swallow even an Olympic athlete. Stay off the pier on windy days. Don't swim too close to the pier because of structural currents. Never, NEVER, jump off the pier.
   
 But nobody tells these rules -- drilled into Holland residents' heads from childhood -- to out-of-towners when they drive up to our shores.
   
 And summer after summer, we write story after story about the power of the big lake. About all the local organizations making public service announcements. About the costs of rescuing somebody from Lake Michigan. About why the Department of Natural Resources doesn't think lifeguards are necessary.
   
 But we know we're preaching to the choir here in Holland. Across the state, Michiganders need to educate themselves about water safety if they're planning on coming to visit our picturesque shoreline.
   
 For those of you who don't know, there have been 901 drownings in the Great Lakes since 2010, with the majority occurring in Lake Michigan, according to the Great Lakes Surf Rescue Project. In 2020 so far, there have been 63 Great Lakes drownings, with more than half (34) in Lake Michigan.
   
 Statistically, the most likely person to drown is a teenage Black boy. Men and boys in general are far more likely to drown than women and girls.
   
 We welcome you to our town and to our beaches. But if you choose to come, please follow these rules, so we're not searching your Facebook page for a good photo of you to use in our article when you drown.
   
 If you're coming to Holland State Park, check their Facebook page to see what color the warning flags are that day. If the flags are yellow, be cautious. If the flags are red, stay out of the water.
   
 If you start to feel even a little tired, get out of the water immediately.
   
 If you find yourself stuck in a current, don't try to fight it. Flip on your back, float to preserve energy and keep your head above water and then follow the current until it releases you. Then, and only then, try to swim back to shore. Teach "flip, float and follow" to your children just as often as "stop, drop and roll."
   
 Learn what drowning looks like. It's not just somebody flailing around screaming for help. It could look like somebody with their head bobbing up and down, with their mouth at water level or their head tilted back.
   
 Have a charged cell phone on you at all times near water. Seconds matter when it comes to a 911 response for a water rescue.
   
 Please, come and enjoy the Great Lakes with us. But don't make us write your obituary because you weren't paying attention.

In many countries, getting diagnosed with Covid-19 carries a stigma, since it requires isolating from family and friends. In the Gambia, anyone who wants to can buy malaria drugs over the counter; as a result, many people are simply choosing to assume they have malaria in order to avoid the ordeal that comes with a Covid-19 diagnosis. "If you turn out positive, then you have to go through the Covid quarantine system that requires you to stay away from your family," he says. "People don't want that."

La reacción no se ha hecho esperar y la Orden de Médicos, que agrupa al colectivo, ha pedido hoy una audiencia urgente con el primer ministro y ha convocado al Fórum Médico, que integra a todas las organizaciones profesionales del sector en el país.
 'Estas afirmaciones, independientemente de que sean proferidas de forma pública o en privado, muestran un espíritu ofensivo para los médicos y un sentimiento negativo por una clase profesional', sostiene la Orden en un comunicado.
 El diario 'Expresso' ha condenado la difusión de este 'vídeo ilegal' y ha anunciado una investigación para establecer responsabilidades.
 'Es una grabación de aficionados de la pantalla de una computadora, que reproduce imágenes de una conversación 'off the record', privada, del primer ministro con periodistas de 'Expresso'; fue divulgada en las redes sociales sin autorización ni conocimiento de este periódico', señala la dirección del diario en un comunicado colgado en su web.
 La polémica ha saltado al ruedo político y la derecha se ha unido en sus críticas contra el primer ministro.
 Los socialdemócratas del PSD le acusan de 'condicionar' las investigaciones y piden explicaciones sobre el caso de Reguengos.
 'Mantuvo a la ministra (Ana Mendes, de Trabajo y Seguridad Social) y no pidió disculpas a las familias que perdieron a sus seres queridos', excribió en redes sociales Francisco Rodrigues, el presidente del Centro Democrático y Social.
 Iniciativa Liberal acusa de 'prepotencia' a los socialistas: 'Siempre que hay tragedias, el Gobierno confronta, nunca asume responsabilidades, nunca ve en qué falló como corregirlo'.
 El ultraderechista Chega carga contra la 'absoluta falta de decencia, tolerancia democrática y de respeto' de Costa hacia los médicos y pide una 'fuerte reprimenda' por parte del presidente del país, Marcelo Rebelo, al primer ministro.
 En la entrevista publicada este fin de semana por 'Expresso', António Costa admite que hubo errores en Reguengos, pero subraya que la residencia es 'de una fundación privada' y defiende que, cuando fue informado de la situación, 'el Estado reaccionó inmediatamente'. EFE
