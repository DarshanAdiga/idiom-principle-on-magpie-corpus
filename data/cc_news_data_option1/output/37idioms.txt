But I’m not really talking about having to go traveling or spending a lot of money. I’m talking about doing different things and doing things differently. Maybe learning a foreign language or a new instrument, or walking around the locker room uncovered and being okay with your body – no matter what you look like. Or going out to lunch with someone you don’t really know and getting to know them better.
 It is like taking care of your garden. At first, it is a lot of work – lots of weeds and weeding. But after pulling out the resistance over time and planting new ideas, it gets easier and more fun to try new ideas/plants. Some will grow and some won’t work out, however you tried it.
 This thought process started with a conversation I had with my sister. She had heard someone say that our life experience is one third genetics (nature), one third upbringing (nurture) and one third the choices that we make in our lives. That sounded good. However, the more I thought about it the more I believe that choices are by far the most significant part.
 We all make choices about how we are going to deal with any given situation. And some (or perhaps many or even all) of those choices influence what happens in our lives over time.
 Two examples are from cats I have known.
 First example: I had just brought home two kittens, and for days they hid under a dresser. In order to see them, we had to lift the dresser and pick them up. Then one kitten got adopted. I was concerned for the other little one as he couldn’t stay in that room under that dresser alone forever.
 The next morning that kitten walked up to me with his tail held high, then walked past me into the house and greeted all the other animals. Overnight he had made a choice. He had made a choice to embrace life. (I ended up keeping him because he was so friendly and outgoing, and fit into my crazy, animal- filled life.)

How much of the sky can you see at any one time? This, of course, assumes you are looking up from a wide-open, flat field or out on an ocean liner with nothing but a flat horizon no matter which way you look.      The entire sky includes every direction you can look from any point on the Earth's globe. The total sky is referred to by astronomers as the celestial sphere. Thousands of years ago, the assumption was that the stars were points of light on a great overhead dome, seen from inside. It does look that way.      One may think the amount of this inverted sphere that you could see from a flat field is one half. That's only true if you are positioned at the very north or south pole, or from the equator.      From the poles, however, all you ever see is the same half of the celestial sphere. From the equator, as the year goes along, you can see the entire celestial sphere, but only one half at any one time.      The Earth's equator is directly under its counterpart on the celestial sphere, the celestial equator. The north and south poles, which mark the axis of the turning Earth, points directly to the north celestial pole (NCP) and south celestial pole, respectively. (The North Star is very close to the NCP.)      If you have an opportunity to travel a few hundred miles north or south, you can easily notice how the sky changes. I've made a few trips to Florida, and have always been fascinated to see how far down in the sky the North Star appears, as compared to my view in Pennsylvania.      The measure of the North Star above the northern horizon in degrees gives you your approximate latitude. From home, my latitude is almost 41 degrees 30 minutes. From mid-Florida, where we have relatives, the latitude is just shy of 27 degrees. The entire sky shifts approximately 14.5 degrees every time I travel to Florida.      The whole celestial sphere is measured in degrees. All the way around the entire sky is 360 degrees, a complete circle. The NCP is at (+) 90 degrees; the celestial equator is at 0 degrees. Latitude has its counterpart on the celestial sphere; it is referred to as "declination." Longitude on the sky is referred to as "right ascension."      From where I live, I cannot see any stars below 48 degrees south of the celestial equator.      There is an entire portion of the starry heavens awaiting me, from (-) 48 degrees to the south celestial pole (SCP) which is at (-)180 degrees.      It's an incredible experience if you are familiar with the constellations, to see how they shift. The farther south I travel, the more stars are visible in the far south, which never break the horizon from home.      From Florida around Christmas time, in early evening, I am fascinated at the fact that the Big Dipper partly dips below the northern horizon, which never happens in Pennsylvania. The marvelous constellation Orion is rising in the east, but from Florida what an odd angle it makes!      FYI: The celestial equator, by the way, passes right through Orion's three- star "belt." From the ice at the north pole, during the 24-hours of night, you would see the top of Orion slowly moving around the horizon as the Earth spins.      From Florida on an early winter evening, I am amazed to see in the far southern sky the beautiful, bright star Canopus, far below Orion's stars and the bright star Sirius. Canopus is invisible from Pennsylvania. At certain times from Florida, I have glimpsed the bright star Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to the sun. Alpha Centauri is very low in the southern sky from mid-Florida; it is better to travel even farther south to see it.      A whole new sky unfolds the more you head south. Perhaps you have had a chance to see the stars from the Southern Hemisphere; I have not had that chance. You can trace the Southern Cross and many more constellations never seen far north. Constellations you are familiar with seeing are upside down when viewed from below the equator. The moon even flips on its head!      Traveling north and south, you witness that the Earth is indeed round like a ball, and you can better appreciate the vast wonder of the stars all the way around.      Full moon is on Jan. 10.      Keep looking up!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

This means teaching them to behave respectfully to others, not just you. When you think your child might be crossing the line, a good rule of thumb is to ask yourself, “Would I let the neighbour say these things to me? If the answer is no, don’t let your child do it, either.

GOOSE CREEK, S.C. (WCSC) - Police are on the lookout for a Summerville man accused of walking out on his bar tabs all over the Lowcountry, leaving the owners to foot the bill.Police say 31-year-old Christopher Davis dined and dashed from at least four bars and restaurants, and possibly several others.The first police report on Davis was filed on Nov. 19 by the owners of the Carolina Ale House in Summerville. According to an incident report, Davis told a bartender he would pay cash, but when the bartender went outside to meet Davis he was gone.Surveillance video shows the man police are searching for in a series of "Dine and Dash" crimes.Officers arrested Davis on Dec. 23. A judge allowed Davis to leave jail without paying any money.The day he walked out of jail Davis allegedly walked out on his tab at Two Keys Public House in Summerville. The manager says after Davis left the bar they ran his credit card and it was declined.“We are a small business so we want to make sure that we’re giving good service to our customers, and so to have somebody come in, it makes you not trust people and that’s hard,” Josephine Uzzo said.A bartender at Thai Taco says Davis skipped out on his tab there on Christmas Day.“It was on Christmas Day so anybody wanting to walk out on a $100 tab on Christmas Day is bad news,” Christine Conrad said.Conrad posted Davis’ surveillance photo and his tab on social media. Conrad also kept Davis’ credit card. She says the suspect was already gone by the card was declined.“It’s not okay for him to just go around and basically stealing from everybody,” Conrad said.Goose Creek cops say last Friday, Davis struck again, walking out on an $18 tab at Crazy D’s on Redbank Road. Police say Davis said he was going to his car to get his credit card, but instead drove off.The victims want Davis to pay his tabs with jail time.“He’s done this several times and it’s time to put a stop to it,” Uzzo said.Anyone with information on Christopher Davis should call Crime Stoppers at 843-554-1111.Copyright 2020 WCSC.

Art was born in Ontario but his heart and soul belonged to the mountains and terrain of Canada's North and West. He made the Yukon his home for many years, where he hiked, hunted, fished and paddled the rivers and remote wilderness, making friends wherever he went. Eventually, he left Whitehorse for Calgary, where his engineering expertise and talent for precision machining allowed him to achieve a successful career, and where he spent the rest of his life. Art enjoyed exploring and travelling, reading novels, listening to great music and playing a good game of golf, but his greatest love and source of pride and happiness was his daughter, who meant more to him than anything in the world. A private celebration of life is planned for the family. We invite anyone who knew and spent time with Art to please share your thoughts and memories with us at www.evanjstrong.com/listings.

Catch disrespect early. It is good to catch disrespectful behaviour early. If your child is rude or disrespectful, don’t turn a blind eye. Intervene and say, “We don’t talk to each other that way in this family.” Giving consequences when your child is younger is going to pay off in the long run.

Gina Dejesus makes everybody smile. She's enormously kind and sweet. Gina's always been a shy little girl with a great sense of humor. Soft spoken. Outgoing. I like to go outside and hang out with my friends, go skating. Loved dancing. "Selena" was her favorite movie. And you couldn't tell her that she wasn't Jennifer Lopez in that video, because that was her thing as a 13, 14-year-old. What dreams did you have for yourself? I wanted to become a lawyer. Why? I don't know, I think it was fun to win cases. She came from a very tight, loving family. Even though her parents struggled for money it was a really happy childhood. 14-year-old Gina Dejesus grew up on the rough and tumble west side of Cleveland, and because of that she learned some hard lessons thanks to her mother. I told her, like, if somebody came up to you and tell you, you know, can you help me look for my dog, I lost my dog. Don't stop, you continue to walk and you ignore the person. I told her to be aware of her surroundings at all times. Despite all the lessons instilled in Gina's brain, it still was no match for the serial predator. Tell us about that day. You were with his daughter? Yes, Arlene Castro. Gina was walking home from school with a friend. We were talking about what we wanted to do cause it was Friday and then I was like, you could come over. And Gina lent her bus money to make the telephone call. She asked her mom and her mom says no. She went the other way, and then I went the other way. The last thing she said to me was, you owe me 50 cents. Right after that, Ariel Castro pulls up and offers Gina a ride. He asks me if you seen my daughter. I said "Yeah, she's right around the corner." And he was like, "Can you help me find her?" And I said sure. And this was the lure trick of Ariel Castro, using his own children as pawns. You felt there's nothing strange about this, right? No, I just knew that that was her father and my dad was friends with him. And next thing you know, he says, can you help me move a speaker at the house? And, sure, I guess, why not? And now she's in the house. He's like, starts, like, to touch me and stuff and then I'm like what are you doing, you could go to jail. And then he just switches up, like, well, okay. You're gonna go home now. He said, but you can't go through the same door you came in. You have to leave through another door. I have a superstition. Well, turns out to be the basement. And then once you were in the basement, what happened? He ended up chaining me up to the pole. Nobody could hear me. The radio was too loud. Gina's a creature of habit, and when Gina didn't show up we knew pretty quickly something wasn't right. Tonight, family and friends fan out into the neighborhood, armed with donated flyers from kinkos, searching desperately for 14-year-old Georgina Dejesus. We're gonna keep going out there and putting as many flyers as we can. It did not become real until we'd seen ourselves on TV, on the local news. That's when it really hit me that she was, something was really, really wrong, that she wasn't home. By air, on ground, every inch of Cleveland's west side under the microscope. I went searching everywhere. Dumpsters, schools, empty buildings. Eerily, this is the exact spot where Amanda berry disappeared a year ago this month. Now two missing flyers of two missing girls mark this corner. Same neighborhood, young girl, a few blocks away. You think you have a serial kidnapper or a serial killer. Because how can you not think they're related. When did you see Gina Dejesus in the house? Well, I heard a little bit of ruckus in the, you know, downstairs when she first came. Noise, like, you know, "Get off of me," stuff like that. He would take my hair and, like, put it in his mouth. I don't know. I don't know why he did it but it was gross. When was the first time that he took advantage of you? May 7th. What are you comfortable in sharing and telling us about that? I'm not comfortable. First thing that popped in my head is, "Oh, my gosh, she's so young. She is so young." Nobody ever deserves to be through something like that. When did you realize that there were others in the house, that you weren't the only one? As I kept watching the news after a while, I was like, "Did you take Amanda?" 17-year-old Amanda berry disappeared in April. Then one time, he was like, I have Amanda berry upstairs. And I have another girl upstairs but she's not on the TV, nobody cares about her. Her name was Michelle knight. Their families were looking for them. But there was no mention about yours. Yes, he would taunt me every single day, your families don't care about you. Ain't you glad I took you? He was very abusive to Michelle, cause Michelle spoke up the most. I felt like he hated me the most, because I was the one that stood my ground. She was defiant. She wasn't taking it, and she would fight back. He impregnated her several he would inflict pain on her and cause her to lose the fetus. Five times you were pregnant. Yes. And each time he aborted it. One was worser than the other. First he'll starve me, he'll give me soda all the time to prevent milk. He'll throw me down stairs. Use blunt objects to abort it. Pipes, bats, he would use anything to make it go away. One day he came in the room and I was sleeping and he jumped on my stomach. I'm sorry, Michelle. And he's the reason why I can't have children now. And that's the most suckiest feeling ever. But he couldn't break me. And I feel, why let the devil control me? Physical scars from the abuse was painful and eternal, but there's no doubt that the psychological abuse perpetrated on these women was equally painfully indelible. He played these terrible, terrible mind games. One day Castro said, "Hey, do you want to play Russian

The community needed it to go away. It provoked things in people to drive by there and see it still standing. You cried. Yeah. Why? Think it was, like, tears of happiness. Everything bad that happened in that house, now it's gone. Michelle came and released some balloons and that was a good moment for the town. That was a good moment for the victims. First thing that I thought is they're taking a horrible situation and turning it into good. What is your relationship with Gina and Amanda to this day? What is it like? I decided to separate from them because we are all going through difficult times and when we see each other it kind of brings back memories. We're a part of this because of what he did to us, but that doesn't mean that we were friends before or we have to be friends after. What these young women decided to do was just keep a low profile. They needed to heal. So we didn't know a whole lot about them except for releasing books about the experience. These women that just have overcome so much. Behind the scenes, do they have struggles like you and I? Without a doubt. But the fact is they get up every day, they put a smile on, they're thankful. It's definitely life changing. I was gone for nine years. I had to learn iPhones, Snapchat. Maybe you can teach me Snapchat, 'cause I still don't get it. I still don't understand it. Oh, I'll teach you. Okay. Once she came home, she was adamant about, I need to do school. I didn't finish school. That's the first thing I need to get out of the way. In 2015, Gina and Amanda graduated from high school. They got a huge standing ovation, and cheers from the people at the graduation, and it was a wonderful day for them. It's like she's determined to do things that was taken away from her from that time. She didn't get to have a quinceanera. So her godmother decided to throw this big party. She had the big white dress. She looked like a princess. Gina, obviously, with her family, they have surrounded her with love and protected her. Amanda has Jocelyn, which is really huge. Your precious daughter. She's a teenager. Listen, yeah. Well, she thinks she's a teenager. She's 12. Let's keep -- she's 12. Okay, okay. I don't want to rush it, all right. Yes, let's not rush it. So how is she? She's happy. She's vivacious. She's doing great. She's in middle school now. Jocelyn is more special than I could even use words to describe. I always describe her as wise beyond her years. Were you able to explain the situation, the chains? Not so much about the rapes and stuff like that, but I did tell her. I used the word kidnapping, 'cause I wanted to make sure she knew what that was. I just explained to her, like, "Your dad is -- he was sick in the mind." I just never want her to feel that -- that she's not here for a special reason. She's here because she's special and I just want her to know that. It's a beautiful thing. I couldn't even imagine what they went through, and then you run into them at a party or whatever, and they're living life, loving life, like nothing had never happened. Michelle, we worried about the most because she had no support, nothing. Oh, my. When I first arrived to the horse therapy it was super amazing. That horse helped me with so much. It showed me something that no other human's ever shown me, respect and love. But now she has this big family of friends that she created. Okay, so now you bowl. I love my friends that I have. I love my chosen family. She's someone that I really look up to. She's got depth. She's so intelligent, such great feelings. I got my adopted dad, which his name is Jim. He's such a sweetheart. He's the one that showed me that men are not all the same. That there are the nice ones out there. When we first met, we were at karaoke. She started singing this particular song. You held me down but I got up She's basically saying no matter what the world should know that she is fine. So now whenever we go karaoke, she knows, that's what I want to hear. And you're going to hear me roar Tell us about Miguel. Oh, my gosh. He is the love of my life. He's my other half. He showed me that life doesn't have to be horrible and you don't have to be alone. That must feel great for you. Yes. She's like a big bomb in a small package. When I first came out of the house, I didn't even know what love was, what a tender touch was. All I knew was abuse. Huge personality. Very, very intelligent. She's got her own light that she walks in. Michelle, she's found happiness and joy. She's married. She looked beautiful that day. I don't know what came over me. I couldn't hold it in. I had tears in my eyes. These women, now they live their lives wanting to change the world for the better. I'm Amanda berry. And I've made it my personal mission to help police find Needles. Essential for the sea urchin,
