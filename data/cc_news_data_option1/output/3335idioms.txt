I started role B and it was a key moment in my life I'd say - a huge turning point as it gave me a step up in earnings and the ability to try strive for some things. The money wasn't fantastic, I'm talking £20k ish but it had the potential to go up every year and this wasn't bad for someone who hadn't been to university. Plus it was a step in the right direction and a big foot into a possible career. This wasnt bad considering it was 2008 and the recession had hit the economy badly with a lot of people losing their incomes.

His speech was strong, moving and intelligent -- and devoid of any digressive rants about windmills or mockery of disabled people. More importantly, the speech played right to Biden's strengths as a man famous for his decency, compassion and sense of justice, so much so that he practically vibrated with anger at what Trump has done to this country toward the end of his speech.

AJ Media Editorial Board
   
 While the ending of the story has yet to be written, Texas Tech authored a fine beginning by announcing the hiring of Krista Gerlich as the new head coach of the women's basketball program.
   
 The decision, made public Wednesday and expected in some corners of West Texas off and on for the past 15 years, offers a feel-good moment for a Lady Raider program recently rocked by controversy.
   
 For openers, Gerlich is a winner. From her days as part of the 1987 girls state basketball championship team at Sudan (while playing for her father; they moved to Spearman prior to her junior year) to her steady performance as the shooting guard on the Lady Raiders' 1993 national champs, she built a solid reputation as a reliable teammate and fierce competitor.
   
 Since her playing days, she has gone on to become a successful coach. Likewise, she has accomplished this the right way, building programs of good character through an uncompromising approach.
   
 When Gerlich's hiring became official, some Tech fans might have flashed back to a similar moment almost eight years ago when another successful former Raider was "brought home" to lead the football program. There is at least one important difference, though, between what happened this week and the hiring of Kliff Kingsbury in late 2012.
   
 While the former Tech QB had not previously been a head coach, Gerlich brings 14 seasons of college head coaching experience to the Lady Raider helm, compiling 289 victories during that span. She has most recently served as overseer of the UT-Arlington program, taking over in 2013. The Lady Mavericks have compiled a 45-19 record during the past two years, and Gerlich leaves as the program's winningest coach.
   
 Prior to that stint, she guided West Texas A&M; for seven years, leading the Lady Buffs to three consecutive Lone Star Conference championships from 2008-10.
   
 Gerlich not only played for legendary Lady Raider head coach Marsha Sharp, she also served as an assistant coach. Based on those connections, a prevailing sentiment was Gerlich would take over the program once Sharp retired. However, that did not happen when the veteran coach stepped down after the 2005-06 season.
   
 Instead, Tech went another way, choosing Kristy Curry as Sharp's successor. In the ensuing years, two other coaches (Candace Whitaker, Marlene Stollings) have led the Lady Raiders, but none has been able to reclaim the national prominence and prestige the program previously enjoyed.
   
 "This is the greatest day of my professional career because I've finally been chosen to be the leader of this program that has been so dear to me," Gerlich said in our story earlier this week. "I'm so thrilled … I'm an example right now, and I'm proof that good things can happen in 2020."
   
 The excitement around her arrival coincides with what may be the lowest moment in program history. The Lady Raider job abruptly opened Aug. 6 when Stollings was fired by athletic director Kirby Hocutt in the aftermath of a USA TODAY story alleging a toxic and abusive culture during Stollings' two seasons as head coach.
   
 Gerlich's first job will be to bring healing to a wounded program while working to restore credibility with current and prospective student-athletes as well as its fan base. To be sure, there is no shortage of work to do. These are important responsibilities, and Tech has selected the right person for the job.
   
 Gerlich knows West Texas, she knows Texas Tech and she knows the core values that make Lady Raider basketball tick. After all, that's her retired jersey No. 21 hanging in the rafters of United Supermarkets Arena.
   
 She is a known commodity who has patiently waited for this moment to arrive, and she is fully and totally prepared.
   
 "She's a West Texas girl, so she knows what kind of players and programs we have in West Texas and in the meantime, she's been recruiting the state of Texas, specifically the Dallas area, the Metroplex area, so she's got several tie-ins there," Joe Lombard, the legendary Canyon coach who recently retired, said in our story. "I think she's a program builder just because she's going to do things the right way and recruit the right kind of people and put a style of play out there that people will enjoy watching. I think Texas Tech did a great job."
   
 We agree. We congratulate Texas Tech on this hire and count ourselves among the many who during the past few days have said to Gerlich, "Welcome home."

I lost my marketing job at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in early March. I’ve spent the year trying to figure out my next steps in the midst of a national crisis. I was searching for jobs one day, scrolling through hundreds of online advertisements, when I came across a “Private Chefs Wanted” post. It definitely piqued my curiosity. One thing led to another and here I am with two 5-star reviews under my belt, a newfound confidence and the faithful reminder that difficult times often lead to beautiful destinations.
 Food Fire Knives is a private chef platform and network that allows anyone to book a personal chef to come to their home to cook and entertain. With my background in culinary entertainment, it was hard for me to see a downside. I joined the Savannah/Hilton Head area team in June and had the opportunity to design four five-course menus. This was the moment for my culinary school training to shine. I set about dreaming up my favorite dishes from a variety of influences, and developed these four concepts: 1) Southern Coastal Heaven, 2) Georgia on My Mind, 3) Rise and Shine Brunch and 4) Tour of Italy. Several of my menus feature top recipes from my book and blog, and I loved the process of creating flavors and designing plating techniques. When an individual wants to book a private chef, they simply visit the website, choose their date and time, and find an available chef. Then, they can study the menus to choose what they’d like to order from entrees, soups and salads, appetizers and dessert. Once the reservation is made, I get to work grocery shopping, prepping ingredients and packing equipment, then show up to their home to execute a Some Kinda Good meal.
 With my menus complete and my profile live, it was time for the booking to begin. I must admit—I have cooked on national television for Bobby Flay and the late Anthony Bourdain and a host of other celebrities, but I was even more nervous about this endeavor. My husband Kurt, reassured me time and time again that my food was good enough, that I was made for this, that I had nothing to worry about, and even though I know he is my biggest fan, the pressure of cooking for paying customers took food preparation to the next level. In times past, facing my fears has served me well and it was time to step up to the plate. See what I did there?

Freeman was a four-sport standout at Claxton and totaled over 700 yards of total offense including six touchdowns his senior year. One of the main reasons he chose Georgia Southern was the history and the fact that it was close to home.
   
 “It’s really nice to be close to home at times,” Freeman said. “My family can come watch me play, and since I am from Claxton I know a lot about the program and came to a lot of games growing up which makes it a cool experience to now be on the field.”
   
 Freeman came to Georgia Southern as a walk-on, but has already caught the attention of his position coach.
   
 “Myles has really fit in well with the group,” said receivers coach Dimitri Donald. “He brings a tremendous work ethic and really embodies what it means to be a Georgia Southern man. His role has changed a little for us, and I look forward to seeing what he’s got with a few more reps in our scrimmage on Saturday. I feel the position change will really help Myles”

The Georgia Southern football team has long prospered off of the fruits of local talent. Currently the Eagles have 11 players hailing from within about an hour's drive of Statesboro, many of whom are starters, with a few more pushing for playing time.  
   
 “You always have to do your due diligence in your surrounding area,” said Georgia Southern coach Chad Lunsford. “I think there is a lot of quality coaching, and a lot of quality players in this area. When we find out about people nearby we can get there in a hurry. We are going to always do our homework close to home, and if they can play Division-1 football we are going to try and get them here.”
   
 One of the biggest names from our area to make an impact is defensive tackle C.J. Wright. At Scrven County Wright made quite a name for himself, not only for what he did on defense, but also as a fullback where he rushed for over 1,000 yards during his junior year. Wright was rated as high as the No. 25 player in the state of Georgia by Southern Pigskins.

Being less than 30 minutes from home had a little to do with Wright’s decision. His family has enjoyed being able to have a short drive to watch him play, but while it’s nice to be close to home Wright tries to remain on campus more during football season.

 The junior played in all 13 games his true freshman year, and nine games last season missing a couple due to injury. Wright was the only player to see action on offense, defense and special teams his freshman year and had 34 tackles including 5 for a loss last season.

Some people are able to fake it and kiss ass, laugh at their bosses jokes, give them the admiration and attention like lapdogs but this is something I've struggled with doing. I'm not an asshole about it but I try to speak openly and honestly at all times and if someone says something that's a bad idea or not possible, I tend to share my thoughts and this isn't well received I guess when you have lapdogs around you saying otherwise.

I'm a very serious person. I've always been a very serious person. For some reason, fabulous is not synonymous with being serious. I've had to take the reins of that and I have had to work through that in my life, in my career the entire time. I have worked through the perception that being fabulous or being pigeonholed into being some sort of clown, or also living in this space or in the room where we have people in positions of power who enjoy the narrative of, "Shut up and sing." They enjoy that, "Shut up and dribble." They enjoy that, "Shut up. You're a prostitute." They enjoy this idea and they push this narrative that, because they, whoever they are, don't deem who you are or what you do as respectable, that your opinion doesn't matter and that you're a dummy. I am none of those things.

Perhaps equally troubling for Graham, his approval rating was in the red, with 47% disapproving of his job performance and 43% approving of it.

 While the ending of the story has yet to be written, Texas Tech authored a fine beginning by announcing the hiring of Krista Gerlich as the new head coach of the women's basketball program.
   
 The decision, made public Wednesday and expected in some corners of West Texas off and on for the past 15 years, offers a feel-good moment for a Lady Raider program recently rocked by controversy.
   
 For openers, Gerlich is a winner. From her days as part of the 1987 girls state basketball championship team at Sudan (while playing for her father; they moved to Spearman prior to her junior year) to her steady performance as the shooting guard on the Lady Raiders' 1993 national champs, she built a solid reputation as a reliable teammate and fierce competitor.
   
 Since her playing days, she has gone on to become a successful coach. Likewise, she has accomplished this the right way, building programs of good character through an uncompromising approach.
   
 When Gerlich's hiring became official, some Tech fans might have flashed back to a similar moment almost eight years ago when another successful former Raider was "brought home" to lead the football program. There is at least one important difference, though, between what happened this week and the hiring of Kliff Kingsbury in late 2012.
   
 While the former Tech QB had not previously been a head coach, Gerlich brings 14 seasons of college head coaching experience to the Lady Raider helm, compiling 289 victories during that span. She has most recently served as overseer of the UT-Arlington program, taking over in 2013. The Lady Mavericks have compiled a 45-19 record during the past two years, and Gerlich leaves as the program's winningest coach.
   
 Prior to that stint, she guided West Texas A&M; for seven years, leading the Lady Buffs to three consecutive Lone Star Conference championships from 2008-10.
   
 Gerlich not only played for legendary Lady Raider head coach Marsha Sharp, she also served as an assistant coach. Based on those connections, a prevailing sentiment was Gerlich would take over the program once Sharp retired. However, that did not happen when the veteran coach stepped down after the 2005-06 season.
   
 Instead, Tech went another way, choosing Kristy Curry as Sharp's successor. In the ensuing years, two other coaches (Candace Whitaker, Marlene Stollings) have led the Lady Raiders, but none has been able to reclaim the national prominence and prestige the program previously enjoyed.
   
 "This is the greatest day of my professional career because I've finally been chosen to be the leader of this program that has been so dear to me," Gerlich said in our story earlier this week. "I'm so thrilled … I'm an example right now, and I'm proof that good things can happen in 2020."
   
 The excitement around her arrival coincides with what may be the lowest moment in program history. The Lady Raider job abruptly opened Aug. 6 when Stollings was fired by athletic director Kirby Hocutt in the aftermath of a USA TODAY story alleging a toxic and abusive culture during Stollings' two seasons as head coach.
   
 Gerlich's first job will be to bring healing to a wounded program while working to restore credibility with current and prospective student-athletes as well as its fan base. To be sure, there is no shortage of work to do. These are important responsibilities, and Tech has selected the right person for the job.
   
 Gerlich knows West Texas, she knows Texas Tech and she knows the core values that make Lady Raider basketball tick. After all, that's her retired jersey No. 21 hanging in the rafters of United Supermarkets Arena.
   
 She is a known commodity who has patiently waited for this moment to arrive, and she is fully and totally prepared.
   
 "She's a West Texas girl, so she knows what kind of players and programs we have in West Texas and in the meantime, she's been recruiting the state of Texas, specifically the Dallas area, the Metroplex area, so she's got several tie-ins there," Joe Lombard, the legendary Canyon coach who recently retired, said in our story. "I think she's a program builder just because she's going to do things the right way and recruit the right kind of people and put a style of play out there that people will enjoy watching. I think Texas Tech did a great job."
   
 We agree. We congratulate Texas Tech on this hire and count ourselves among the many who during the past few days have said to Gerlich, "Welcome home."

Here's the deal. Yes and no. Yeah, it was real. Yes, it was gritty. Yes, it was New York City of a time. But it was also highly dysfunctional and highly dangerous. Being a Black man who grew up in the ghetto, I know how to navigate those spaces, but when you're in a big city, I also understand the need and the want to transform it into something that is not dangerous and that is better. I understand the desire for that, so I go back and forth. It's like, yeah it's cleaned up. I don't have a problem with that. Do I miss the old New York? Yeah, but it was not . . .
