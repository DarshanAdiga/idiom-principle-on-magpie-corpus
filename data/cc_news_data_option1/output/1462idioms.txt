Everyday, at noon, 26-year-old Malhar Joshi waits for the doorbell of his Pune home to ring. It is the tiffin service delivery person dropping off his lunch. Through a grill door, he exchanges pleasantries. The two-minute talk with the delivery man is the only human interaction Malhar has had for over a month now.
 “Being stuck at home alone is about the safest thing now. But it always weighs on the mind that I don’t have anyone to interact with, face to face. Video or phone calls are not always the best substitutes. And because I had anxiety issues in the past, they are cropping up again. The enclosed space and the inability to be outside of it for a sustained period is making them worse,” says Malhar.
 The lockdown, put in place to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic by social distancing and enforced isolation, is taking a psychological toll on several people, as they struggle to adjust to this major lifestyle change. Acknowledging it, several mental health professionals across the country are offering their services through phone and video calls. Many of them offer their services free and round the clock.
 Sanika Ekbote, counselling psychologist and co-founder of Mumbai-based mental health initiative The Pink Project, sums it up: “For most young adults and teenagers, this is probably the most difficult phase of their life, as they haven’t seen or experienced such major change in their lifestyle before. Unlike our grandparents, we have not lived through wars or disease outbreaks of this scale, so this is our first experience of dealing with a pandemic. The uncertainty is leading to anxiety.”
 Sanika and her partner, sports and exercise psychologist Sanika Divekar, put up a post on March 20 on their Instagram handle @thepinkkproject, initiating a dialogue about mental health issues due to the lockdown. They offered their services for free during the 21 days. “We get over 10 new people every day, mainly talking about how confinement is bothering them. A lot of students have been reaching out as they are bothered about the impact this will have on their careers. There are also those who are overthinking about their past actions and decisions,” says Ekbote.
 In such times, they assure people that it is okay to feel worried and anxious. “They are comforted by the fact that their worries are valid and these are tough times. We try to keep them engaged by giving them tasks or activities that will keep them occupied like workouts or cooking,” she adds.
 Initially, the duo had decided to keep their services open for 24 hours. But after the first few days, they realised that confinement and the continuous sessions were taking a toll on their own mental health. “I started having a lot of negative thoughts myself. I would worry about the effects of the lockdown on the economy and analyse the impact it will have on all those people who called us for help... It never stopped, so my partner and I decided to work between 10 am and 9 pm.”
 Devanshi Goradia also opened up online counselling sessions. Since the Mumbai- based clinical psychologist put out a post about mental health issues that the isolation can cause, she has been receiving at least 25 messages per day. “There is grief, panic, loneliness, fear and a sense of hopelessness. In the initial days of the lockdown, even I felt helpless, but a lot of friends and family members reached out to me for help to deal with isolation,” she adds.
 People across Kochi, Kolkata, Delhi, Ludhiana and Mumbai have been reaching out to her for help. “The only positive thing about this lockdown is that people who have had mental health issues before but never paid heed to it due to ‘a lack of time’, are now reaching out and seeking help.”
 The lockdown is hard not only on young adults but also on the senior citizens. Tanvi Mallya, neuropsychologist and founder of Tanvi Mallya’s ElderCare Services in Mumbai, has been spending days trying to work out a strategy to help them. “Most of them have a fixed routine, with morning walks or a stroll with their friends in the park that they look forward to. Keeping them at home becomes difficult for the family. Most of the family is also anxious, as elderly people are a risk group when it comes to COVID-19,” she says. So her team regularly hosts question-and-answer sessions, or goes live about the ways in which elderly people can be taken care of.

Barcelona coach Luis Enrique tentatively branded Luis Suarez an honorary Catalan after the striker's vital brace in the 2-1 Champions League win against Atletico Madrid.
 The holders fell behind to a Fernando Torres strike in the all-La Liga quarter-final first leg at Camp Nou, but the goalscorer then saw red after picking up two bookings in quick succession to hand Barcelona the initiative.
 Suarez might also have been sent off for kicking out at Juanfran but escaped censure and went on to score twice inside 12 second-half minutes to turn the tie around ahead of next week's return clash at the Vicente Calderon.
 The Uruguay international has 45 goals in as many club matches this season and Luis Enrique would be happy for the proud South American to have secondary entry on his passport.
 "He has settled extraordinarily at Barcelona," he said of Suarez, who moved to Camp Nou from Liverpool after the 2014 World Cup.
 "He looks, not Catalan because Uruguayans could kill us, but he looks half- Catalan!
 "What Luis Suarez does for us, not just his goals, but his work and character, is why we decided to sign him."
 Overall, it was another display from Barcelona that lacked their customary fluency, on the back of Saturday's Clasico defeat to bitter rivals Real Madrid.
 Star man Lionel Messi is in the unusual position of being without a goal for three club matches but his boss is unconcerned.
 "I've seen Leo be very participative, not just tonight but also in El Clasico,” he said.
 "Our challenge is very difficult and playing football is very complex.
 "Despite having top quality players you can go through difficult periods like this and we shouldn’t become crazy or be too worried.
 "There is not going to be an easy game against Atletico Madrid. None of us expects it to be."

She added: “We ended in-person contact just before lockdown was brought in last month and have all our staff and any volunteers working from home; fortunately we’ve had really good IT support and there’s been very little disruption to our services.
 “Phone and video support are being provided, we’re taking calls over Zoom and we’re also still able to keep our group work going as well.
 “We’ve adapted well; video calls are new to us and it might be something we continue to use again in the future if a client can’t make it to the centre for whatever reason.
 “Face to face contact is undoubtedly the best method, but everyone is adapting at the moment and clients are very understanding of that – we support around 50 clients per week and while there are a few who have opted to wait and get back in touch once the centre reopens, the majority have been happy to take up our phone and video support.”

Luis Enrique says the fact Barcelona have to play after title rivals Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid again this weekend is of no concern.
 La Liga leaders Barca could find themselves as low as third by the time they kick off at Real Betis on Saturday, with both Madrid clubs in action earlier in the day.
 The reigning champions faced the same issue last week, when Real and Atletico won before they hosted Sporting Gijon.
 Luis Enrique's side, who sit above Atletico on goal difference and one point clear of Real, showed no signs of feeling the pressure against Gijon, though, running out 6-0 winners thanks in the main to Luis Suarez's four-goal haul.
 And the coach insisted La Liga's scheduling does not change the way his team will approach their trip to Estadio Benito Villamarin.
 "Sometimes we've had to play before and win and that creates pressure on them and vice-versa – all we can do is go out and win our games," he said.
 "There's a special tension coming onto the last games of the season and the eventual winners will have shown great strength to deal with that pressure.
 "I'm not focusing any energy on the games of Real Madrid or Atletico Madrid. I'm only thinking about Betis.
 "Every game is difficult [but] things depend on us because we're top."
 Barca's elimination at the hands of Atletico in the Champions League quarter- finals means they have enjoyed a rare break without a midweek fixture following the rout of Gijon.
 And, with both Madrid clubs having played Champions League semi-final first legs this week, Luis Enrique feels that could benefit Barca.
 "It's nice to play every three days because of what that signifies, but it's been good to have some rest," he added.
 "We have the objective of going to Seville and beating Betis, but we face a difficult task.
 "Juan Merino [who took over from Pepe Mel at Betis in January] has turned the club around well, getting the players up front playing well.
 "They're good down the wings, and Ruben Castro can score goals. They don't try to complicate things too much, they use the ball to good effect.
 "Always the fans are behind them and that can have an influence on the score. But it's up to us to make sure it doesn't."

_" Yeah you're right. 'Common Courtesy' was a struggle. The process took a long time and then there was the really big gap of time in-between where we weren't sure if things were going to work out and if the court case was going to crush us. Then it goes to 'Bad Vibrations', which in hindsight everybody needed so they could feel connected to the music again. We thought it was very important to get into a room and be a band again. Whatever comes out comes out. It was about creating together from scratch, which is the first time we've done that since the first two albums. So with 'You're Welcome' the difference is being supported by a group of people who respect you and are amazing at their jobs. Having a huge team of people who have great and creative ideas that add to the situation. So I had a bunch of songs saved up this time that I believed in and I had a label who wanted me to write just as much as possible and get me in a room with as many people who I thought were awesome creatively as possible. People would always joke when I came in to a room saying 'Are we going to write a song with a breakdown or what' and I would say 'Let's just write a really good song and I'll worry about making it an A Day To Remember song'. That's how every song we write is written anyway."_

  _“_ I grew up coming to the Whales Rib when I was a little kid. They used to have one of those claw game machines, but instead of cheap toys, it was filled with Florida lobsters (which they would cook for you for $10 or something along those lines). Pretty amazing, but alas it was taken away, probably to appease lobster sympathizers. The Whales Rib is the quintessential beach bar, Florida restaurant. It is located a half block from the Deerfield pier and has all kinds of crazy ocean and fishing stuff all over the place. I always get the Whale fries (kind of a hybrid of thick cut potato chips and French fries, amazing) and their sandwiches, which come on a super tasty whole wheat bun. The mahi (aka dolphin) sandwich blackened is clutch and the Key West, a pastrami Rachel sandwich, is really good stuff. Stone crab claws when in season also make the table, and sometimes I’ll order I’ll order fried shrimp for nostalgia.”

Luis Enrique has hailed Lionel Messi's otherworldly statistics ahead of Barcelona's La Liga encounter with Real Madrid as the Argentinian stands on the verge of scoring his 500th goal at professional level.
 Messi has netted 449 goals for Barcelona, while adding an additional 50 for Argentina and could hit the 500-mark at Camp Nou on Saturday.
 Luis Enrique is adamant the 28-year-old's statistics are unique and feels other players would struggle to match him even if they counted their goals on the training ground.
 "Messi being on the verge of his 500th goal at professional level is something from another galaxy," Luis Enrique said at a media conference.
 "Normal players would not even reach that figure if we count our goals in training.
 "I've seen the faces of Messi and the other players. They are crazy to play and win the Clasico."
 Saturday's Clasico will see two of the world's most prolific attacks go face to face as Barcelona are expected to line up with Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar against Real Madrid's attacking trident of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.
 However, Luis Enrique has stressed it's not a duel between both attacks as they need their team-mates to shine.
 "It is not a match between MSN and BBC. It is a match between two teams," he added.
 "For all that they are doing, the attacking tridents need the support of the rest of the team.
 "It is important that we remain compact throughout the game. And then hopefully Messi, Suarez and Neymar can reach their level."

“We’re trying to look on the bright side of being able to take advantage of some of this time without games to get up to speed on some big-picture projects that we had anticipated taking longer, or that are usually confined to the offseason, because during the season you have this day-to-day flow of issues that land on your desk,” executive vice president and general manager Mike Elias said on a video conference call Monday. “Amongst those are building our internal scouting and information and analytics database, which we have really ramped up and is basically up industry standards at this point already, we believe.”
 Whether named for the popular anti-hero from the Balitmore-based HBO show “The Wire,” or, as an anagram, as other teams have done, this database, like the television show character, contains multitudes: scouting reports, video, projections and analytics. And the shutdown has given the Orioles time to get all of that up to speed, too.

Because of new state rules aimed at stopping the spread of coronavirus by reducing jail populations, a man who was arrested last month for stealing and crashing a school bus was released and arrested again over the weekend — this time for stealing and crashing four trucks in Redwood City, according to District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe.
 Miguel Santos Murillo, 23, of Redwood City, has been charged with six felonies, including commercial burglary, car theft and vandalism, plus four misdemeanors for his actions Sunday. Murillo has also been known as Santos Miguel Murillocuellas, Wagstaffe said.
 Murillo already has faced charges related to a March 28 incident in which he allegedly stole a Sequoia Union High School District school bus and sped through Redwood City before striking a Pacific Gas and Electric transformer, causing more than $100,000 in damages, according to court documents.
 Murillo was released from jail Saturday, Wagstaffe said. The next day, he allegedly committed a similar offense.
 In the early-morning hours Sunday — police responded to a call at 4:30 a.m. — Murillo allegedly broke into All Fence Company, Inc., located at 1900 Spring St. He proceeded to steal one of the company’s trucks and crashed it into a pole before stealing a second truck and ramming it into the business’ gate, where it got stuck, Wagstaffe said. The keys to the trucks were in the ignition.
 Murillo then stole a third truck, which officers found that morning stuck on the concrete train-track curb barrier near the intersection of Chestnut and Spring streets in Redwood City, Wagstaffe said.
 After crashing the third truck, Murillo then went back to All Fence Company and stole a fourth truck, which he drove to Gunn High School in Palo Alto, Wagstaffe said. Murillo in the fourth truck rammed a fence at the school, sped around campus doing doughnuts — the antics were captured on surveillance video — and ultimately got stuck on the baseball field, Wagstaffe said, adding that Murillo was found by police on campus. There were no injuries.
 Murillo was determined to be under the influence of methamphetamine and marijuana when he was arrested, Wagstaffe said. Moving forward, his office will be looking into Murillo’s mental health history.
 “I don’t know what’s going on, but he has all the characteristics of someone with methamphetamine and mental health problems,” Wagstaffe said, adding Murillo’s criminal history includes only a few minor infractions.
 Wagstaffe’s office argued for an exception to the new state rules that would otherwise allow Murillo to walk again. The court accepted the argument and Murillo remains in custody on $1 million bail. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 29.
 For the alleged school bus theft and associated damages, Murillo’s bail was set at $5,000, Wagstaffe said.
