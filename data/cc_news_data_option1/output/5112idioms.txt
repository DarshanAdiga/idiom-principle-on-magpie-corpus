BOSTON (AP) — A fishing vessel that became stranded off the coast of Massachusetts last Sunday has been towed to safety after a five-day operation, the U.S. Coast Guard announced Saturday. The fishing vessel Fearless was 160 nautical miles east of Nantucket on Sunday night when it became disabled and called for help. Winds were more than 20 miles per hour at the time with 8-foot waves, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard cutter Tahoma took the fishing vessel into tow on Monday and hauled it five days before turning it over to a towing company near Buzzard's Bay on Friday. No injuries were reported. Cmdr. Eric Johnson, Tahoma’s commanding officer, gave credit to the fishing crew's experience. “The crew quickly and expertly set the tow and were proactive about monitoring it and communicating during the transit,” Johnson said in a statement. The 270-foot Tahoma is based in Kittery, Maine.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Carole Baskin, an activist for big cats, sat down and binge-watched “Tiger King” on Netflix just like everybody else. The end product, which she believed would resemble a “Blackfish” for tigers, had almost nothing to do with saving big cats, she said — a real “missed opportunity” for the film that made her famous. Roughly 34 million people watched “Tiger King” in the first 10 days it was available, according to Nielsen. Many more watched after that. But if “Tiger King” viewers instead focused their attention on “The Hidden Tiger,” an upcoming documentary from Knoxville director Michael Samtesto, the impact would be “Earth changing,” she told Knox News. Samtesto called upon Baskin to share her expertise for the film, which explores the impact tiger captivity has on cats in cages and wild tiger populations “The Hidden Tiger,” which is scheduled to come out Dec. 26, has been in the works for more than five years. And it all started just up the road from Knoxville at Roane County’s Tiger Haven. “The story just kind of continued to expand and unfold for us,” Samtesto told Knox News — all the way to India and Nepal. AN INTEREST IN CATS STARTED WITH DOGS Through Rescue Doc Films, founded alongside Knoxville producer Josh Gildrie, Samtesto had already told the story of rescuing dogs with the documentary “A Southern Fix.” The production company shared the reality of companion animals killed in the United States and focused on exploring answers for the devastating problem. “And we thought the rescue world was pretty interesting,” Samtesto said. Tiger Haven welcomed him with open arms as he shifted his focus from dogs to tigers, offering behind-the-scenes access to the self-proclaimed “safe place for...
