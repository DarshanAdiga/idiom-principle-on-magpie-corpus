The mayor tells News 5's Amber Grigley he supports renaming the street, but it must be done the right way.

The installation features notes, original pages from the manuscript and a map of the town Ukulore, hand drawn on a chalk board by Cave in 2020. To begin with Nick Cave considered his work with the novel an extracurricular activity, but it ended up kind of an obsession to him, and he would work on the book for days without sleeping. At the time Nick Cave often lived with friends and did not have his own typewriter, so the manuscript was either written by hand or on borrowed typewriters. Nick Cave would carry the manuscript around with him in a plastic shopping bag with the result that he lost it twice‚Äîonce in Berlin and once in London. As it was the only copy, each time Cave had to start writing it again from scratch.‚Äù

MUMBAI ‚Äî Singer-actor Sonu Nigam‚Äôs short film "Spotless,‚Äù which traces the indomitable spirit of an acid attack survivor, will be presented on his YouTube channel June 25.


  "Spotless" had earlier travelled to film festivals like CKF International Film Festival, International Short Film Festival of India and Buddha International Film Festival.


  The Saurabh M. Pandey directorial stars Shweta Rohira along with Sonu.


  "'Spotless' is an important film because of its sensitive portrayal of a very important issue which unfortunately we as a country still grapple with regularly. We want people to realize what an acid attack can do to a person physically and mentally, so as to hinder anyone who even thinks of attempting this. If this movie can, in any which way, make a difference for the better, I think we'd have achieved our goal," said Sonu.


  The story revolves around a young couple who battle circumstances to come to terms with an incident that shook their world. It throws light on factors like family support and strong will, which are imperative in such unfortunate situations.


  Interestingly, Sonu always felt a deep sense of compassion towards acid victims after he had heard of a sound engineer's daughter falling prey to this heinous crime. The perpetrator is still unpunished. When Pandey approached him for the role, Sonu agreed because he liked the script and was moved by the message of the film.

SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) ‚Äî With COVID-19 cases surging in about half the country, there are a growing number of cities and states now requiring that people wear masks when they are out in public.Even as Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Monday afternoon that Phase II will continue for at least another 28 days after Friday‚Äôs deadline, he declined to make wearing a mask in public mandatory in his state.The developments come with a growing divide in this country about wearing those masks. That‚Äôs why we headed out to a free COVID-19 testing site to learn more.And it wasn‚Äôt difficult to spot car after car lined up Monday morning right outside Mount Canaan Baptist Church in Shreveport.For some the people who were getting tested, the stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm supposed to have surgery. And I just wanted to make sure that I had, you know, everything‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Mary Friday said.At that testing site, wearing a face mask was mandatory. But venture elsewhere in the city and you quickly spot people not wearing masks.Caddo Commissioner Steven Jackson, who was volunteering for the day at the Mount Canaan testing site, explained why some people ‚Äî particularly senior citizens and African-Americans ‚Äî wear masks more than others do. ‚ÄúI think the closer it hits to home, the more serious you take it. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I tell people, you know, it‚Äôs not just about you,‚Äù Jackson continued. ‚ÄúAnd so, if you know somebody who has been sick, you tend to take this thing more seriously. So we see more seniors sheltering in place still.‚ÄùErnest McCowan, who was in the drive-thru to get tested for COVID-19, suggested that when it comes to younger people not wearing masks, it‚Äôs the same old trope that they feel invincible at their age.‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt think that they can catch it. A lot of people think that because they are young they won‚Äôt catch it. But, I mean, until they have a vaccine for it, you need to wear a mask.‚ÄùGerman researchers recently announced that wearing a mask can reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus by 40 percent.Yet here in the U.S., some people increasingly have framed the question of whether to wear a mask in terms of being a Democrat or a Republican.Jackson called that trend unfortunate."We shouldn't politicize public health. Public health should be one of those things where we all should take serious, whether we are Republican, Democrat, black or white, rich or poor because this virus doesn't discriminate between either of those."And Jackson noted that not wearing a mask also is a symptom of pandemic fatigue.‚ÄúWhat I tend to see is a lot of people are dropping their guard. They‚Äôre not wearing a mask. They may not be taking their social distancing aspect serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHowever, what I want to encourage people to understand is the virus has not gone anywhere.‚ÄùEven before the governor announced the delay in starting Phase III, we asked Jackson whether he thinks we‚Äôre ready for the that phase."In my honest assessment, no. I really didn't think we were ready for Phase II. But I think we have to kind of go forward and see how we embrace it."McCowan also explained that moving to Phase III requires more members of the public to understand why wearing a mask helps so many others who have compromised immune systems."We have elderly family members and I wear my mask for me. But I wear it for them also because I don't want them to get sick because of my stupidity or somebody else's stupidity."Community activist Alyssa Fyfe also shared her take on why we‚Äôre seeing certain groups wear face masks in large numbers while others do not.‚ÄúSuch as the elderly community. They are way more likely to be at risk. So it‚Äôs going to be more of a priority for them,‚Äù she opined. ‚ÄúWhereas for people from 18 to 22ish, especially people that are going out and actively protesting, might just not slip their mind for that one moment.‚ÄùLouisiana now ranks seventh out of 23 states experiencing an increase in COVID-19 cases.And according to figures provided in the governor‚Äôs statement, Louisiana has surpassed 3,000 deaths and 50,000 positive tests since the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus was reported March 9.Copyright 2020 KSLA.

A few showers and thunderstorms could linger across central North Dakota Friday morning, but otherwise, expect a dry day to end the week.

Melvin ‚ÄúRex‚Äù Emerson Jr., 198th district judge, signed an order in March allowing Auld to be off sex offender bond conditions and have more time outside the home. The order was agreed to by the 198th District Attorney‚Äôs Office.
 Current bond conditions now require Auld to wear the GPS monitor, remain in Kerr County unless authorized by the probation office, be at home from
 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. and provide urine samples as directed, among other requirements, according to the order.
 Auld was first arrested Nov. 5, 2016, after Kerr County Sheriff‚Äôs deputies began investigating the disappearance of Magan Nicole King, a 26-year-old San Antonio woman.
 She reportedly was last seen on the 5,600-acre Auld Ranch in West Kerr County, so a search warrant was executed there with the help of Department of Public Safety troopers, a DPS helicopter, the Travis County Search and Rescue Unit with search dogs and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice search unit, as well as horses.
 King‚Äôs vehicle was discovered loaded onto a trailer in a remote part of the ranch, and human remains also were found, according to Kerr County Sheriff W.R. ‚ÄúRusty‚Äù Hierholzer in a previous article published in The Kerrville Daily Times.

In 1995, there was a conference of the Newspaper Proprietors‚Äô Association of Nigeria (NPAN) in Kaduna. A new executive was to be elected at that conference to take over from the one that was led by Chief M.K.O. Abiola, the publisher of the Concord newspapers, who was in prison arising from his declaration of himself as President of Nigeria, based on the results of the June 12, 1993, election. A group within the NPAN thought no new executive should be elected since the NPAN president was in detention. Another group thought the election must be held since Abiola was not incarcerated because of what he did for the NPAN, and since his term had expired and the association needed to continue to function. The two camps were at daggers drawn. Those who supported Mr. Ismaila Isa, publisher of the Democrat, who was expected to become the new NPAN president, threatened to break up the association. It was a flesh-cutting row that threatened the very existence of the association. We had to find a midway solution that would pacify the two warring groups. Sam Amuka, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, publisher of Champion newspapers, and I came up with the proposal that a high-powered team should be set up to fight for Abiola‚Äôs release while the meeting should elect its officers who will bear the burden of pushing the committee to get Abiola freed. That was how the breeze that was likely to knife the lungs of the NPAN was blocked. Ismaila Isa became president and I general secretary of the NPAN, thanks to the wisdom of Amuka, Iwuanyanwu and a few other persons at the conference. I was general secretary at a time the industry was in crisis. General Sani Abacha had proposed a National Mass Media Commission and Press Court, which, if enshrined in the Constitution, would be a major hinderance to the practice of journalism. We needed to find a way of dealing with the problem. Amuka said to me that I must see myself as the think tank of the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO) and always prepare a communiqu√© from home to be distributed at meetings. The NPO is made up of Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and NPAN. At that time, the three groups were holding joint meetings under the NPO umbrella to find ways of dealing with the threat to the journalism profession posed by the Abacha regime. I found Amuka‚Äôs advice very, very invaluable. He emphasised, ‚Äújust draft a communiqu√© before you come for the meeting. When you distribute it, we will quickly cross the t‚Äôs and dot the i‚Äôs and go away. If we waste too much time here, Abacha‚Äôs men will just come and pack all of us into jail and the media will be doomed.‚Äù

PLAINVILLE -- For nearly 80 years, there were countless comings and goings from the building at 142 South St. in the town center, from firefighters and the fire department's dalmatians to elected officials, municipal employees and residents stopping in to do business with the town.
 Now it's the building itself that has come and gone.
 After a few weeks behind a chain-link fence while asbestos was removed from its aged frame, the building known most recently as "the old town hall" has been demolished. The last of the walls came down just last week, leaving the building's life-long neighbor -- the historic Humphrey House that is home to the Plainville Historical Commission and town museum -- to preside over the entrance to Telford Park alone.
 The building's removal comes a little more than a year since town offices moved from the cramped World War II-era facility to the new town hall just down the street at 190 South St.
 Town Administrator Jennifer Thompson said the town had a study performed to determine whether it would make more sense to keep and renovate the building for parks and recreation use, or build new.
 "The study revealed it would be more cost effective and feasible to build something new rather than renovate," she said via email. "Town Meeting then approved the demolition of the old town hall."
 Given the town's current financial situation, she said, "there are no immediate plans to build a parks building," though that is the hope for some future point.
 "For now, the lot will be cleared and gravel will be placed in the lot where the town hall once was," she noted.
 Bittersweet moment
 For those who spent many years working in the building -- either as elected officials or town employees -- the demolition is bittersweet.
 "I have mixed emotions. It's another piece of Plainville history that's no longer with us," said Town Clerk Ellen Robertson, who worked in the building for 11 years before the move to the new town hall.
 But it was a building that had stopped being useful to the operations of a growing town in the 21st century, and one that, after being used constantly -- and for more than one purpose -- since 1941, had nothing further to offer.
 Robertson recounted her visit to the building back in 2008 when she went to pick up nomination papers to run for town clerk.
 "I remember the first thing that hit me was the smell," she said. "It smelled musty and moldy and I thought, 'what am I doing?' I thankfully followed through."
 While the building itself "was terrible" -- in its last years the toilets were constantly overflowing, the roof frequently leaked, the heating was wonky, the air was stale, and the space was overcrowded -- Robertson said "the great group of people that worked in that building" made up for the shortcomings until the town was finally able to invest in new facilities.
 Former long-time Selectman Robert Fennessy said the building was "quaint" and "had the feel of a small town, where everyone watched out for each other."
 But there was very little separation between those who worked in the building and those who dropped in on town business "because the quarters were so tight." The selectmen's "meeting room," for example, was also the town administrator's office space for many years, and a half door was the only thing that separated the town clerk's office from a closet-sized hallway space in front of it where residents stood to conduct business with members of the staff.
 "It definitely had a warm feeling, although the warmth did not come from the 50-year old-burner in the basement," Fennessy quipped.
 He said he will miss seeing the old building, "but I feel good that we now have a new building that will take us through the next 50 years."
 Assistant town accountant Annemarie Eisele, who worked for many years in the building, also said it's bittersweet to see the old building gone. When she saw photos of the pile of rubble showing up on social media recently, she admitted, "I kind of teared up a little bit."
 "But it was more like, 'wow, that's 19 years of my life just sitting there, going down," she said. "It was a strange feeling, but it needed to come down."
 For the future, she said, "personally I would love to see a rec building for the park department there, so they have a place to go on rainy days and they don't have to go running to buses to go over to the schools."
 Fennessy agrees.
 "I always thought that the location was ideal as a teen center, as it borders the town park, and maybe in better fiscal times the town can look at developing it for a new program," he said. "But right now, I'm sure the park commissioners will appreciate the added parking space as they bring in more and more participants in their activities."
 From fire station to town hall      At the end of the day, the town got quite a bit of use out of the old building.
 Its first purpose was as a fire headquarters, replacing the original fire station on Spring Street known to some today as "the Scout House." It was built in 1941 on the site of the former waiting station for the local trolley, next to the then Plainville Library inside the Humphrey House, according to Historical Commission Chairman Kristine Moore.
 Construction began in late spring of 1941, with the foundation laid and walls taking shape by July 13, 1941. It was nearly complete by Aug. 5, 1941, just about four months before the U.S. entered World War II.
 Then town offices would eventually occupy a small section of the fire station closest to the town park entrance. In 1973, the town built a combination police and fire building just down the street to meet the need for more adequate and updated space for the departments -- the now former public safety building that is presently up for sale by the town.
 Once the fire department exited 142 South St., the building was renovated and re-purposed solely for town offices.
 Moore noted that as the building was being taken apart recently -- an operation that had to be done carefully so as not to potentially damage the Humphrey House -- "the ghosts of the old fire station were observed throughout the building" -- from the outline of the old garage bays, to the outline of the windows the hoses would be draped from, and the mount for the old fire pole still present on the second floor. There were even the names of former firefighters etched into the walls and door frames.
 From an historical standpoint, she said, "it is very difficult to see yet another building of Plainville's past become only a memory."
 "It was sad to learn that the building could not be salvaged due to the asbestos and would meet the same end as   the old Wood School. It will certainly be strange from now on, looking at the Humphrey House and not seeing its neighbor," she said. "I have lived in Plainville my entire life, and like the Wood School and Falks Market, the (old) town hall has always been around; it was as familiar and recognizable as my own home and will be missed."
 The Historical Commission, she said, has an "abundance" of photographs of the old fire station/town hall from its construction to its demolition. Many of these are available to see on the commission's Facebook page and are also on display at the Humphrey House.
 A documentary exploring the history of Plainville's town offices and public safety is available on the commission's YouTube Channel: Plainville Historical Commission PHC.

Generally speaking, Ondo is still not what my state should be. It should be a business-oriented state; investors‚Äô destination, commercial hub of the country and the most viable among the 36 states. We are heavily endowed with mineral resources, human capital and capacity, as well as experienced and brilliant people. All we need to do is to tap into them for the overall benefit of the citizens. I will be pragmatic, focused and forward-looking in my policies and programmes. For example, the Olokola project has been there for long. I remember a meeting I had with some Britons, who said they were ready to inject about $18billion in Nigeria. We must revisit it; it is a game changer. Ondo remains the only place in Africa even in the entire universe, with a virgin 1.47km shoreline. What that means is that nobody has ever touched it. I have travelled all over the world for holidays and I know what people make from such shoreline. I will declare an emergency in that sector and bring the best hands and stakeholders; the best town planners to design the 1.47km shoreline to a paradise. I am aware that many investors with deep pockets are willing to come to invest in the state. But they are only waiting for a conducive environment where their money and other forms of investment are not imperiled. Many multibillionaires, within and outside Nigeria, will bring their businesses to Ondo State once I become governor because of my international business connections, coupled with my cordial relationship and partnership with them in business and commerce. I have been to the Philippines. About 20 to 30 million people travel to that country monthly, just to see and feel the beautiful and serene terrain of the islands. We can replicate the trend in Igbokoda, Igbo-nla and Aiyetoro. These places are beauty to behold. We have natural lakes and islands. We need to open up the tourism/hospitaly sector for the whole world to enjoy. It is when they fully developed that the whole world will come to Ilaje and Ese Odo to savour the richness of our culture, tradition and conviviality.

I‚Äôm not at scared at all. I am not afraid because I love challenges. That is why I have consistently said that we need someone that can think out of the box at this trying moments in the history of the land. The price of crude oil in the international market has tumbled. Therefore, a governor that cannot think clearly to see what to do in order to boost the internally generated revenue of his state is bound to be in a quagmire perpetually. I am propelled by my vision and mission statement already captured in a blueprint, my template designed to buoy the economy of the state, and herald a new dawn. Ideas rule the world and it is the catalyst for huge successes being recorded by genuine investors in business in the real sector of the economy. I live and do a lot of business transactions in Lagos every day. Dealers in that state sell N300million worth of timber in form of planks. Do you see any timber plantation or forest in Lagos? No. so, why can‚Äôt we have the finished products in Ondo State and only market them in Lagos? So, we just have to use what we have to get what we need. Malaysians make more than $17 billion now every year from the export of palm oil all over the world. Sadly in Ondo State, we are not doing anything tangible that can bring about value addition to the sector towards achieving a similar feat. The rubber industry; cocoa production, cassava cultivation and other arable crops are all begging for attention. We have no excuse to say Ondo State does not have the capacity to generate more than enough Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) to sustain it. We need a governor with business acumen, background and pedigree to harness all these resources. He must be a sound individual that can think outside the box; a governor that is creative and transparent. Right now, I do not think that as an oil-producing state, we are not getting what we deserve because the largest bitumen deposit has not been tapped. Besides, the state is facing serious ecological issues with getting the necessary attention from the Federal Government.

"Modern Country," Alan Prazniak's second solo exhibition here--reconfigured, of course, for virtual presentation--is an exploration of landscape painting that merges the classical with the hallucinatory. The show is accompanied by a video of the artist's studio that features him flipping through assorted sketches, with details of the seventeen oils on view. We get a sense of the canvases' relatively modest scale through a shot of several hanging together, salon style. In a voice-over, Prazniak posits that a painter's mission is "to get lost." Indeed, his restless, searching hand visibly scales every inch of these pictures, resulting in works that engage and extend observation, making you crave the intimacy of examining them in real life.
  _Interlude_ __ (all works 2020) is a wispy wet-into-wet image featuring a distant sun, rolling hills, a pond, and blades of grass. Although formally and chromatically ascetic, it is nonetheless activated by the artist's vivid paint application, which, at various moments, can be buttery, viscous, wan, and even luscious. The picture plane of _The House of the Orchard_ is kinetic yet contained, built from wonky geometric forms. A bird, a wolflike creature, and a single floating flower are rendered as flat decorative motifs that flank a nighttime scene at the heart of the piece, which suggests a portal into an untamed elsewhere. _Gradual Stone_ is agitated, ominous: It depicts a billowing and heavily impastoed smoke cloud rising from a small site on a scumbled horizon. The sky is tinted orange and roiling with churning brushwork. Landscape is Prazniak's subject matter, but so is oil paint, which he employs with great skill, emphasizing its physicality and versatility. Although the artist's wandering takes place on the surface of the canvas, he pulls us deep into the construction of each tableau and its seductive, inscrutable pleasures.
