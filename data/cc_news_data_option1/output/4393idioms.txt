Everything is fresh about the Owatonna volleyball team this year, and that includes the Huskies’ official Twitter account.
 Browsing the team’s new profile for the first time, which was created just three months ago and can be found at “@VB_OHS,” I stumbled across a photo of a gray t-shirt with the word “Growth” etched across the middle in bold white lettering atop a thick line with “Outcome” beneath it.
 The simple, yet equally profound message reveals everything you need to know about the Huskies’ philosophy this year: The results are far less important than the actual process. Basically, if the season ends with the program in a better place than where it started, 2020 can be considered a resounding success.
 It’s about incremental growth — baby steps, if you will — and summoning the strength to keep the ship sailing forward despite the uneasy waters and the somewhat ambiguous nature of the entire campaign. The Big Nine Conference has improved tremendously since the last time Owatonna won its last championship and the often-foreboding atmosphere amid the ongoing pandemic is inescapable, a harsh reality that looms over all athletic teams this fall/winter.
 Conversely, Owatonna didn’t drop from its throne atop the conference and section overnight, that’s rarely how these things work out. It took eight seasons, multiple years of turnover at every level of the team and three different head coaches for the program to drift this far from 2012 when the Huskies captured their most recent conference title. Though I sincerely doubt it will take another eight years to reach the top again, it will take some time. Patience is in order.
 However...
 I wish there was a little more palpable evidence to back this up, but I’m convinced the team is in the infancy stages of the complete revitalization project. The Huskies haven’t blasted off yet, but they’ve at least reached launching-pad and their trajectory is pointing up.
 New head coach, Tai Tolle, is committed for the long haul and is intent on reshaping the program’s culture and allowing the on-court results to take care of itself.
 In order to rebuild, you have to start from the ground up, and that’s exactly what the team is doing with things like offering free youth clinics throughout the fall, because its these future generations that will one day form the core of the Huskies’ varsity squad in the not-so-distant future.
 During the tail-end of the Huskies’ dynasty that saw the team capture three section titles and two Class AAA state consolation championships from 2007-2012, the current crop of seniors were about the same age of the girls they are now instructing, so it’s neat to see things come full circle.
 But enough about what _was_ , or what _will be_ , and let’s move on to _right now_.
 Owatonna started the season 2-1, but has since dropped three consecutive matches against some of the toughest competition it will see on its abridged schedule. In fact, two of the Huskies’ three previous opponents — Northfield and Rochester Mayo — are a combined 10-0 as of Thursday afternoon and the Raiders have won all six of their matches by a combined score of 18-0.
 Though it is going to be difficult to completely judge the on-court development until the Huskies — or any team for that matter — plays a full complement of matches (nonconference, tournaments, etc.) and competes beyond the section tournament, the Huskies are already 40% of the way to equaling last season’s win total through only six matches.
 Owatonna has also managed to side-step the considerable lull that haunted last year’s team that started 0-11.
 Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how the Huskies perform against non-juggernaut teams such as winless Rochester John Marshall on Monday and against Red Wing (2-3) on Nov. 13.
 The Huskies have solid blend of athletes from three different classes. Senior Emily Hagen started the season with a bang — recording nine kills in a 3-0 sweep of Albert Lea — and leads the team in that category through five matches while sophomore Ava Eitrem has accumulated 14 kills.
 Haylee Mullenbach leads the back row with 34 digs, nearly half of which came against Winona last Saturday.
 Bailey Manderfeld is tops on the team with more than 50 assists.

And this is a dynamic that we see internationally all the time. That’s frankly why international observers can play a really important role. It’s quite often the case that there are allegations of fraud and rigging, and there might be a kernel of some factual information in some of those claims. Then when you kind of disassemble that, you dig deeper, and you look at the facts, you find out that there was a problem there but it wasn’t a systematic problem: It didn’t represent a large number of votes, and it didn’t have any impact on the outcome. And so you’re going to have narratives that are going to play into those fears. This is what we see very, very often.

Second, it perpetuates the underlying condition versus COVID argument and shifts the focus off the real problem. Some argue that those that die of underlying conditions (cancer, heart disease, diabetes) and are also COVID positive at death should not be counted in the COVID death statistics. Is it relevant to argue, post- mortem, if hypoxia from COVID caused a fatal heart attack in someone with heart disease? Or, if a COVID infection was too much for someone with cancer to fight off? What is relevant is preventing deaths in the first place; the real problem is Americans cannot get a handle on how to do this. Instead, we want to argue over one tree when the whole forest is on fire. Unfortunately, there are few role models in leadership that listen to infectious disease experts, wear masks, and encourage their supporters to as well.

Republicans were traveling the roads of southern Minnesota Thursday in one last push to gather voter support ahead of Tuesday’s election.
 Tyler Kistner, the Republican candidate for the 2nd Congressional District, stopped at Met Con Cos. in Faribault as part of a daylong campaign trip around the district. Flanked by state Republican leaders and other GOP candidates, including U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn from the 1st Congressional District and state Sen. John Jasinski from Faribault, Kistner made his case for voter support as Republicans attempt to flip his district from blue to red by defeating Democratic U.S. Rep. Angie Craig on Tuesday. The close race caused his “last blitz” around the district ahead of Election Day to get out his message that he will bring “servant leadership” to Congress if elected, Kistner said.
 Kistner’s “Send in the Marine” campaign tour comes amid a large Republican focus on Minnesota ahead of the election that will include President Donald Trump’s campaign stop in southern Minnesota Friday. With five days to go, Minnesota Republican Party Chair Jennifer Carnahan said she believes their efforts will pay off on Election Day.
 “People are just fired up. They’re excited about reelecting our president to four more years, standing behind all of the Republican candidates on the ballot,” she said.
 The Trump campaign has focused heavily on Minnesota in recent months with Trump’s campaign stops in Bemidji, Duluth and Mankato and Vice President Mike Pence’s recent campaign stop in Hibbing. Trump narrowly lost Minnesota by 45,000 votes in the 2016 presidential election and has since noted that he believes he could have won the state if he had campaigned in Minnesota one more time.
 Trump’s visit on Friday is critically important to “make sure we’re turning out the base, we’re getting out the vote, that all of the Trump supporters that were with him in 2016, but maybe didn’t vote in 2018, that we get them all back,” Carnahan said.
 Carnahan said they’re “absolutely” expecting Republican voter turnout to be as high this year as it was in the 2016, both among early votes and in-person votes on Tuesday.
 “People are very concerned about the country. They understand how important this election is,” Carnahan said.
 Campaigning on his experience in the U.S. Marine Corps, Kistner told the crowd of a dozen people in Faribault that he will put constituents ahead of himself in Congress. Harkening to having “objectives” as a Marine, he said Tuesday’s election is the “objective.” Kistner, along with other Republicans who spoke at Thursday’s campaign stop, made it it clear that Tuesday’s election is more than choosing elected officials, it’s about making a stand for a way of life in Minnesota.
 On the state level, Republican legislative candidates are pushing to win Tuesday to keep their majority in the state Senate and win the state House as the legislative redistricting process, following the 2020 Census, hovers on the horizon next year. Redistricting will shift the Legislature’s dynamics for the next decade and “if we don’t have control of the state Legislature, (Democrats are) going to do everything they can to make sure your conservative voice and your conservative values, those Minnesota values, those family values will never be heard again,” Kistner said.
 Minnesota House Assistant Minority Leader Tony Albright warned that Tuesday’s election is important because the divisions between the Republican-majority Senate and Democrat-majority House have allowed Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to act “unilaterally” with executive orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Republicans need to maintain their majority in the state Senate this election because they are the “only backstop” to Walz’s actions, said Albright, a Republican from Prior Lake. Voters on Tuesday are choosing between “law and order” and “tyranny,” he said.
 “This is a referendum on a way of life,” Albright said.
