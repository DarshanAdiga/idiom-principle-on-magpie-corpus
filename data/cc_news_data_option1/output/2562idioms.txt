Latest to bear the coveted "Gran Turismo Sport" label, the two SUVs trace back their lineage all the way to the original 904 GTS that first earned the badge its kudos in 1964.

Dear Cde President,
 I know chances of you reading this letter are next to zero but all the same I write to you on the basis of you being "a listening President". Cde President it is crystal clear that the majority, @ 98% Zimbabweans are suffering, really suffering simply because of the deeds and misdeeds of a very few individuals 2%. These few individuals have captured the whole of Zimbabwe, holding us at ransom treating us as subhumans if not economic slaves.
 These few individuals are well known by everyone including the law enforcement agents but surprisingly no one is willing to stop them from their very evil deeds of looting, plundering, laundering, syphoning, chicanery, economic sabotage, forex externalisation, price distortion and massive corruption. Everyone is wondering why, Cde President you ignore this barbaric evil which is happening everywhere be it in high offices, border posts, highways, shops, industry, church, commerce and even in politics? Cde President you must act and act fast. Heads must roll and surely big heads must fall now!
 We the poor starving povo can't take it anymore. Imagine a situation where local shops are refusing to accept bond coins and notes. These coins and notes are a legal tender as directed by your government, never mind how our USD where converted to this bond animal by your government. To be frank that was day light robbery. Now the bond is as useless as one can imagine. The RBZ governor promised to resign should the bond fail and surely as one occupying an esteemed office must simply honour his promise. Since he is still in the office long since the bond failed please have guts to fire him without any single benefit because he is part to the economic challenges we are facing.

Spas and firms offering complementary therapies such as massage, detox and hydrotherapy have told the BBC they could go out of business soon if they cannot reopen in July.
 "I can sustain my business for another two weeks, and that's it," says Michelle Geraghty-Carns, owner of complementary therapy clinic EternalBeing and spa firm EternalSpa in Enderby, Leicestershire.
 Entrepreneurs in the industry were already struggling with a slump in demand, having had to shut their businesses due to coronavirus restrictions.
 And so, when spas and firms offering complementary therapies were not included on a long list of businesses allowed to reopen from 4 July, many felt dismay.
 Ms Geraghty-Carns, who has been in business for 20 years, last week made the difficult decision to shut her spa down because she could no longer afford the lease on the premises.

WASHINGTON - Senator Bernie Sanders has joined an anti-annexation letter spearheaded by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, which threatens to cut US assistance to Israel should it move forward with its plan to annex parts of the West Bank. Sanders is the only Senator to sign the letter, alongside 12 House Democrats, including Rashida Tlaib, Betty McCollum, Pramila Jayapal and Ilhan Omar.
 "Israel's annexation of occupied territory would be a disaster for international law, self-determination, freedom, and equality," Sanders tweeted on Tuesday. "I stand with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and House progressives. We cannot allow US tax dollars to be used to violate Palestinians' human rights."
 The letter which was sent on Tuesday to US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, urges the Trump administration not to greenlight the move, warning that "it would lay the groundwork for Israel becoming an apartheid state."
 "Unilateral annexation in the West Bank is in direct opposition to the principles of democracy and human rights that the United States of America is supposed to stand for," the letter reads. "At a time when the American people are taking to the streets to demand justice for all in our own country, there is no question but that such an action would alienate many US lawmakers and citizens. Members of Congress should not be expected to support an undemocratic system in which Israel would permanently rule over a Palestinian people denied self-determination or equal rights."
 The group also warned Pompeo that should the Israeli government promote the plan, they will "work to ensure non-recognition of annexed territories as well as pursue legislation that conditions the $3.8 billion in US military funding to Israel to ensure that US taxpayers are not supporting annexation in any way."
 "We will include human rights conditions and the withholding of funds for the offshore procurement of Israeli weapons equal to or exceeding the amount the Israeli government spends annually to fund settlements, as well as the policies and practices that sustain and enable them," the lawmakers added.
 The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) released a statement on Monday to announce its opposition to the letter.
 "The U.S.-Israel relationship is a mutually beneficial partnership that reinforces our moral values and strategic interests. The overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans, in Congress and across the country, agree that America is best served when we stand with Israel," AIPAC said in a statement.
 The pro-Israel group added that America's security assistance to Israel is an investment that serves the US national interests, including promoting peace and deterring war.
 "Our lone, stable, democratic ally in the Middle East faces unprecedented threats and challenges, and American support is critical to ensuring our strategic partner remains strong and secure. Annual security assistance helps ensure Israel can defend itself, by itself," the statement reads.
 The Democratic Majority for Israel opposed the letter, as well. "DMFI opposes annexation, but we're urging House Democrats NOT to sign AOC's letter," the pro-Israel PAC tweeted. "Unlike letter opposing annexation sent by 189 House Dems, this one is bad policy, bad politics, and counterproductive to the goal of stopping annexation and encouraging a two-state solution."
 Last week, some 190 members of House Democrats released a letter expressing opposition to Israeli annexation. However, that letter did not threaten to condition US aid to Israel.

 A vacancy created by the resignation of the president of the board of the Sunrise Beach Fire Protection District, will mean the two remaining members will be appointing the third member.
 According to information provided by the district, the board met in an emergency session late last week to accept the resignation of Brian Laymen, who had been serving as president of the fire district. The district was notified of the resignation on June 18. Layman cited his moving out of the District as the reason for his resignation. The resignation was effective immediately.
 The board held an emergency meeting on June 24 to formally accept the resignation. The next meeting will be July 20.
 At the July meeting the Board will discuss how to proceed with filling the vacant seat. Under RsMO 321.200.2 - Any vacancy on the board shall be filled by the remaining elected members of the board, except when less than two elected members remain on the board any vacancy shall be filled by the circuit court of the county in which all or a majority of the district lies. The appointee or appointees shall act until the next biennial election at which a director or directors are elected to serve the remainder of the unexpired term. The remaining board members, Dill and Bob Hemen, will select a member of the community to fill the vacant seat until the April 2022 election.
 Dill and Hemen have often been at odds over fire district policies and staffing. Hemen, at one time, prior to the most recent election challenged Dill's appointment to the board.
 Layman's seat would have been up in the April 2024 election, however due to his resignation, the district will be required to hold an election for the seat in April 2022 and that election will be for two years to complete the term. In April of 2024, that seat will revert back to a six-year term.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Tuesday arraigned one Ikenna Onwuzuruike, also known as Jeff Sikora, before Justice A.T. Mohammed of the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital.
 Onwuzuruike, a self-styled president/chief executive officer of United States- based Prime Trust Credit Union Bank, was arraigned by the EFCC, Port Harcourt Zone on eight counts bordering on conspiracy, impersonation, forgery, possession of proceeds and obtaining money by false pretence.
 The suspect was alleged to have swindled his victims to the tune of $8.5m.

A GWANDA miner has been arrested for allegedly strangling his workmate before dumping the body on a railway line, where it was crushed by a train to conceal the murder.
 The matter was initially treated as a suicide case after deceased's body was later run over by a goods train.
 Albert Ncube (31) of Spitzkop Suburb was not asked to plead when he appeared before Gwanda magistrate, Miss Lerato Nyathi facing a murder charge. He was remanded in custody to July 13.
 Prosecuting, Mr Silent Shoko said Ncube accused the now deceased Onias Mushipe of "stealing" his girlfriends which resulted in a misunderstanding.
 "On 1 June at around 7PM Ncube and nine other artisanal miners including Onias Mushipe boarded a Toyota Granvia vehicle and headed to Prospect Gold Mine at Mgomo Farm in Gwanda. Along the way a misunderstanding arose between Mushipe and Ncube after Ncube accused him of taking away his girlfriends," said Mr Shoko.
 "Their workmates managed to calm them down in order to stop them from fighting further. The gang dropped off at Cobra Mine which is opposite Mgomo Farm. The other mine workers went ahead to do their work and Mushipe, Ncube and their workmate Mr Tinashe Dube remained behind to resolve the dispute they had earlier."
 Mr Shoko said Ncube further accused Mushipe of snatching his girlfriends and tripped him to the ground before strangling him.
 He said upon realising what had transpired Mr Dube fled from the scene leaving Ncube behind with Mushipe's body.
 Mr Shoko said in a bid to conceal the offence Ncube then took the body to a nearby railway line and placed it there with the head on the line facing upwards. He said at around 10PM Mushipe's body was crushed by a good's train.
 The matter was reported to the police who attended the scene.
 Mr Shoko said police received a tip off on Saturday resulting in Ncube's arrest. Ncube has been on the run for the past two years after committing robbery and attempted murder cases in Fort Rixon where he reportedly robbed a victim and further tried to dump the body in a disused mine.

Her beauty does not lie in her features, as she is rather plain. Instead, it lies in the strength she emotes as a symbol of the American frontier woman, one of hundreds of thousands who often left behind a more quiet life with their husbands in exchange for what they hoped was economic opportunity.
 Her expression shows that she knows such an exchange will come at a price.
 She is one of 12 identical statues placed across the country in 1928-29 along two migration routes, the National Road and the Santa Fe Trail. People can view her towering, 10-foot likeness not only in Pennsylvania but also in Maryland, West Virginia, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, California and Arizona.
 As she is here, she often is overlooked or neglected. Attempting to pull over and walk around her statue was risky. The cars fly by at a blind spot on a curve and the arc of a hill. But looking at the strength portrayed in every inch of her construction and image, it’s unclear whether or not she’d care if you stop.
 If you do stop, you’d best not whine about it.
 A frontier woman probably would have thought it frivolous to honor her, as she just is trying to make a way for herself and her family.
 The project to build all 12 monuments to highlight the courage of these women was spearheaded by the Daughters of the American Revolution to remind us that the Wild West was not just a place of stories but also families looking for a fresh start.
 Along the way, on a quest that included breathtaking vistas, hardship, lawlessness and finding a sense of place in the wide-open spaces of the American frontier, they might find gold.

In a letter to the Congolese president, Felix Tshisekedi, Philippe stopped short of issuing a formal apology, but proclaimed his “deepest regrets” for the “acts of violence and cruelty” and the “suffering and humiliation” inflicted on Belgian Congo.
 The removal of King Leopold II's statue took place only hours after Philippe's letter was published. The monarch, who ruled Belgium from 1865-1909, plundered Congo as if it were his personal fiefdom, forcing many of its people into slavery to extract resources for his own profit.
 The early years after he laid claim to the African country are especially infamous for killings, forced labor and other forms of brutality that some experts estimate left as many as 10 million Congolese dead.
 Following a short ceremony punctuated by readings, Leopold's bust in Ghent was attached to a crane with a strap and taken away from the small park where it stood amid applause. It will be transferred to a warehouse of a Ghent city museum pending further decision from a city's commission in charge of decolonization projects.
 “Removing statues does not erase history, it rectifies history and makes new history that rightly calls into question dominant narratives," said Mathieu Charles, an activist from the Belgian Network for Black Lives.
 Belgium has long struggled to come to terms with its colonial past, instead focusing on the so-called positive aspects of the colonization. But the international protests against racism that followed the May 25 death of George Floyd in the United States have given a new momentum to activists fighting to have monuments to Leopold removed.
 Earlier this month, about 10,000 people gathered in Brussels despite the social distancing measures implemented to fight the spread of COVID-19, with many protesters chanting anti-colonialist slogans.

 Details of the law remained under wraps until 11 p.m. (1500 GMT, 11:00 a.m. EDT), when it was published and took effect immediately.

That's par for the course with Porsche, and I'm not sure anyone even vaguely familiar with the brand expects a "cheap" car. What sets the 2021 Cayenne GTS and GTS Coupe apart, though, is how little in the way of compromise it feels like you're making. On the one hand it's a luxury SUV like every Cayenne; on the other it's a not-that-distant cousin to the Panamera GTS Sport Turismo. Porsche expects only 10-percent of overall Cayenne sales to be GTS models, of that a roughly fifty-fifty split between SUV and Coupe. Quite honestly, the other 90-percent of owners are missing out.

The Lagos State House of Assembly has called on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to direct the Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture to liaise with the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice to look at the Listed Sites (Prevention) Law, 2015, with a view to removing all vestiges of slave trade and colonialism.
 This motion was moved by the Deputy Majority Leader, Noheem Adams, representing Eti-Osa constituency 01 at the plenary session on Tuesday.
 In the motion, the lawmaker recalled the gruesome killing of George Floyd in the U.S. by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin.
 “The Assembly further noted that this brutal and callous murder of Floyd triggered worldwide condemnations, demonstrations, and protests against the continue police violence and racism of blacks in US and Europe without provocation”.
 “The House is aware that these protests further drew attention to the reality of systematic racism, oppression and domination of blacks by whites in spite of abolition of vexatious slave trade and related activities since the 18th century”.
 “This House is further aware that the demonstration brought about the pulling down of status of Edward Colston, a notable slave trader into a river in Bristol, London, while the British authorities removed from her museum status of another prominent slave master and promised a review of history pertaining to slave trade monument and sites,” he said.
 In his comment, the Speaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, said the motion was not about history, and that history could not be changed.
 Mr Obasa added that statues are not history and that Africans all over the world should give backing to blacks fighting for the rights of fellow blacks.
 “South Africa got her independence much later than the rest African countries and they are not talking about ‘Black Lives Matters’ campaign,” he said.
 “We must protect the interest of our people all over the world. So many statues in London and other places are being brought down. We should change the names of some of these buildings. We cannot bring down the buildings because they were once used by colonial masters.

Trying to calculate how much charging your electric vehicle will cost is deceptively challenging, which becomes immediately apparent when you read how the DOE came to their numbers. To start, researchers tried to figure out how electricity costs vary by state and time, and found that they run the gamut from $0.10 to $0.23 per kWh. Next, they factored in the cost of installing a charging station, the way that different cars charge, the time of day, and the type of charger you’re using.
