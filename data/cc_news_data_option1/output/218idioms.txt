MADRID (AP) — Authorities in Spain's tourist-magnet Balearic Islands are clamping down on binge-drinking tourism in three hot spots, introducing what they claim is the first law of its kind in Europe. The islands' regional government based in Palma de Mallorca on Friday passed a law prohibiting the organization and promotion of pub crawls and publicity promoting of alcohol sales by means of “open bars” and “happy hours.” It also prohibited the practice of jumping from hotel balconies into swimming pools — popularly known as “balconing” — throughout the Mediterranean islands. The practice has led to many injuries and several deaths. Those caught taking part in the activity will be obliged to leave their hotel and may face fines. The legislation will apply to a long stretch of the capital, from Palma Beach to the S'Arenal area, as well as the Magaluf spot on Mallorca island, and the West End area of Ibiza, initially for the next five years. Mallorca and Ibiza are two of Europe’s most popular tourist destinations, and its nightclub- filled beachfront promenades are particularly popular with young people from Britain, Germany and Ireland. The regional government said the law is a novelty in Europe and that it's aimed at improving the quality of tourism on the islands and the wellbeing of both tourists and residents. The regulation bans alcohol-selling machines, and shops selling alcohol must close between 2030 GMT and 0700 GMT in the areas. It freezes new licenses for so-called “party boats” and forbids them from taking on or offloading revelers in the three areas. The legislation envisages fines ranging from 6,000 euros ($6,660) to 600,000 euros.

CHICAGO (AP) — Two young brothers were among five people shot and wounded when gunmen fired through the window of a Chicago barbershop, police said Friday. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said it’s “heartbreaking” the youths were among the five shooting victims — ages 11, 12, 16, 30 and 40. He said the five remained in serious to critical condition, but all were stable at local hospitals Friday. The gunmen had walked into the Gotcha Faded barbershop Thursday in the West Garfield Park neighborhood and looked around, moments before firing into the shop from the street, Chicago police Deputy Chief of Patrol Ernest Cato told The Chicago Tribune. Guglielmi said Friday morning that no arrests had been made but police believe there are at least two suspects and they have “very good” surveillance video from outside of the barbershop. Detectives were reviewing that video to try to determine where the suspects may have gone in a vehicle after the shooting. He said the motive in the shooting remained unclear. “We intend to interview the victims, and individuals who were in the store, to try to get a handle on what might have prompted the attack,” Guglielmi said. Lorenzo Matthews, 11, and Michael Smith, 12, were at the barbershop when they were both shot, their mother, Cierra Mobley, told WLS-TV. \"It's their first time at the barbershop and it's somewhere that they really wanted to go. They were only there for like an hour before I got that phone call,\" Mobley told the station. Mobley said Lorenzo had surgery late Thursday night after he was shot three times. The boys’ uncle, Chris Williams, decried the violence that is impacting children. “It’s a shame what the world is coming to,” Williams told the Chicago Sun-Times. “Kids can’t even get their hair cut.”

ARIMO, Idaho (AP) — A school district board has unknowingly violated the Idaho open meetings law for years after conducting its entire annual superintendent evaluation behind closed doors, a board chairman said. Marsh Valley School District 21 Board Chairman K.G. Fonnesbeck said the board recently discovered approving the superintendent's evaluation and contractual changes in one motion in executive sessions was a violation, Idaho State Journal reports. Fonnesbeck was voted the new chairman at a Tuesday board meeting after 13 years as a school board member, district officials said. The board first learned it was committing a violation when it was notified by attorneys for the state Department of Education last month that approving Superintendent Marvin Hansen's evaluation, contract extension and pay increase during a closed-door session in December was against the law, Fonnesbeck said. Board members opened the meeting Tuesday by acknowledging the December violation and voided the approvals for Hansen, officials said. They also re- approved Hansen's evaluation and contract extension in separate motions while postponing a decision on his raise, board members said.

One of the teenage boys found guilty of murdering schoolgirl, Ana Kriégel, will seek to have his conviction overturned on April 24. The 15-year-old, referred to in court as Boy B, was unanimously found guilty of murdering the “lonely and vulnerable” schoolgirl last June and was sentenced to 15 years detention, to be reviewed after eight years. Boy A and Boy B, whose identities cannot be published as they are children, were just 13-years- old when they murdered 14-year-old Ana in May 2018. Boy B lured Ana from her home, knowing that his friend was waiting to attack her in a derelict house in St Catherine’s Park in Lucan. He gave several different versions of events to gardaí, but eventually admitted seeing Boy A attacking Ana. Now aged 15, they were unanimously found guilty of murder by a Central Criminal Court jury last June. Boy A was also convicted of Ana's aggravated sexual assault in a manner that involved serious violence. Boy A was sentenced to life imprisonment with a review after 12 years, and eight years imprisonment for aggravated sexual assault. No appeal has been lodged on his behalf. Boy B is seeking to appeal against his conviction only, meaning no appeal is being sought against the severity of his sentence. During case management procedures in the Court of Appeal today, April 24 was fixed as an early hearing date for Boy B’s conviction appeal. President of the Court of Appeal Mr Justice George Birmingham said arrangements would be put in place for the hearing that both sides consider appropriate. As both boys were children, the Central Criminal Court adopted procedures from the Children’s Court, which saw lawyers and judges wearing suits and ties rather than gowns. Counsel for Boy B, Damien Colgan SC, said breaks were taken during the course of the trial on account of the boys’ ages. Mr Colgan said he expected the appeal hearing to take a day. Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Brendan Grehan SC, said two grounds of appeal identified by Boy B’s lawyers were “fairly straightforward” but another ground of appeal “might take longer”. Mr Colgan said he had identified a number of issues that would be argued as grounds of appeal, and he asked for the entirety of the transcript of the 42-day trial to be released so “we can start working” on them. Mr Grehan said the case had attracted media interest that was “above and beyond” what was usual and the trial judge, Mr Justice Paul McDermott, had restricted the media’s representation in court during the trial. Mr Justice Birmingham listed the case for mention on March 13 “to take stock” of arrangements that would be put in place. Boy B was not present in court for the case management procedure. He is currently detained in Oberstown Children Detention Campus and there are already processes in place for his direct transfer to court for the appeal hearing, the court heard. The earliest possible release date for Boy B is in June 2027. Sentencing the boys last year, Mr Justice McDermott said that the boys’ first period in detention would last until they were 18, when they will be transferred to an adult facility. Mr Justice McDermott ordered that reports on the boys’ engagement with educational, psychological and psychiatric services be prepared to assist those taking over their custody. Reports should then be prepared at two year intervals, chronicling what has happened, which would be available to the courts at the time of their review, the judge said. After the boys' transfer to adult prisons in 2022, reports should be submitted in 2024, 2026 and 2028, he said. "They are not reports for the purpose of micro- managing the sentences, it is for the courts to have a very clear view of what's happened during the course of their detention.” How both boys faced up to their culpability while in custody would be a factor in determining how long they would eventually end up being detained, Mr Justice McDermott stated.

There is a scene in the American film classic "Judgment at Nuremberg" where defense attorney Hans Rolfe, played by Maximilian Schell, is cross-examining a Nazi judge about the Nazi sterilization of undesirable women. Schell cites a case where the high court of another country authorized the sterilization of a "feeble-minded" woman who was the daughter of a "feeble-minded" mother. The court opinion concluded, "Three generations of imbeciles are enough."      Schell dramatically concluded his cross-examination by revealing that the author of the opinion was the vaunted American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes. "Judgement at Nuremberg" was a fictional account of the war crime trials of German judges. However, Justice Holmes' opinion in Buck v. Bell - which upheld the sterilization of women in the state of Virginia - was indeed cited in Nuremberg.      During the trial of German SS Officer Otto Hoffman, his defense cited Buck v. Bell as proof that a so-called enlightened country like the U.S. was also involved in the "science" of human improvement through controlled breeding. In the U.S. we called it eugenics, in Nazi Germany it was referred to as creating the master race.      Carrie Buck was born and raised in Charlottesville, Virginia. She became pregnant at age 16. Her foster parents had her institutionalized as a "feeble- minded moral delinquent," despite her claims that she had been assaulted by their nephew.      When she gave birth, her child was adopted by her foster parents. Buck was sent to the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-minded in Lynchburg. Buck's mother was already a resident there.      Just prior to Buck's commitment, Virginia enacted a new law authorizing sterilization of, among others, the feeble-minded and the socially inadequate. With three generations available for examination, the colony set out to prove that the Buck women were defective. They sought to have Carrie Buck sterilized under the new law.      The Supreme Court supported Buck's sterilization by a vote of 8 to 1. Holmes' 1927 opinion is remembered as containing some of the most infamous language ever delivered by the high court.      According to the USA TODAY, Carrie Buck was the first victim of the 1924 sterilization law. As a result, about 8,300 Virginians were involuntarily sterilized. The law was repealed in 1974, but Buck v. Bell has never been overturned.      State laws permitting sterilization of individuals deemed unfit to reproduce - most commonly institutionalized persons with mental illness, or even conditions such as epilepsy - were common in the first half of the 20th century. According to the USA TODAY, more than 65,000 people were sterilized under such laws, which were enacted in more than 30 states.      In 2010, Paul Lombardo, a law professor at Georgia State University took a close look at the plight of Carrie Buck and other women subject to draconian sterilization regulations. His book, "Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck," revealed that the Buck women were not feeble-minded imbeciles.      Through his research, Lombardo found report cards for Carrie and her daughter Vivian. Buck had passed each year with "very good" marks. Vivian had made the honor roll. There was nothing to suggest any mental deficiency in either of them. Unfortunately, Vivian died at age 8.      It is astonishing that the United State was, not so long ago, a leader in eugenics. Leading medical professionals, legal scholars and lawmakers subscribed to a theory that espoused terminating the reproductive rights of the mentally ill, intellectually disabled or other "undesirables."      Even more appalling, Holmes, a civil war hero himself, would in the wake of the horrors of World War I, introduce his argument in support of sterilization in the following manner, "We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices."   Matthew T.

On the song's music video, she said, "We could have easily gone the super on the nose route of following the imagery in the lyrics. We could have had the whole big ballroom of people and played out line by line everything that happens as the story unfolds. But one night, I was like: what if we don't even use confetti. What if we find another way to use color and find'another metaphor for the metaphor.' My dad saw an old picture of Jackson Pollack painting while his girlfriend sat and admired him."
