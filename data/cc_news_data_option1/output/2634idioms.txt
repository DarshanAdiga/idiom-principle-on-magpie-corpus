One very select group of fashionistas were not crying into their cocktails when the Paris fashion shows were cancelled because of the coronavirus.
 The tiny group of super rich women who buy the ruinously expensive handmade creations that adorn the runways of Paris haute couture week knew that meant their favourite designers would have to come to them.
 "I thought they would be upset," the French courtier Julien Fournie told AFP as he prepared looks for his film for the French capital's first virtual fashion week, which starts Monday.
 "But it was quite the opposite," he added.
 Haute couture's made-to-measure creations -- which are only shown in Paris -- can cost the price of a luxury sports car.
 With no glitzy shows to go to this time, the jetset queens that usually patronise them expect their own personalised presentations in their palaces and penthouses.
 Fournie, who trained as a doctor before turning his passion and considerable anatomical know-how to couture, said he was used to flying to the Middle East and Asia with the head of his studio, Mademoiselle Jacqueline, for fittings and adjustments.
 \- Royal clientele -
 The difference between couture creations and those you buy off the rail is between night and day, he insisted.
 "While you have to get into ready-to-wear clothes" -- adapting your body to the norm -- "in haute couture, the clothes are made to wrap you," the designer said.
 And Fournie only makes one-off pieces to ensure the exclusivity that his very well-heeled clients crave.
 "Once a client from a royal family cancelled an order after seeing a similar creation worn by Lady Gaga," said the house's director, Jean-Paul Cauvin.
 "For them, exclusively is everything, and they don't want that tainted by fame or vulgarity."
 For that reason, Fournie tends to avoid lending his dresses out to stars for red carpet events, except when the singer or actress has a style that really chimes with the "DNA of the house".
 Fournie's film for his virtual Paris show on Tuesday is more of a teaser than a classic run through the collection.
 \- Cut for 'real women' -
 "We are not showing too much," Cauvin said, to avoid any unseemly competition that might sometimes arise after shows when "clients really set their heart on a particular look and want to put an option on it" before anyone else does.
 This time, without a formal show, it will be more about pampering the client, Cauvin added. "The couturier will have dresses in mind just for them."
 Fournie is known for designing for "real women" with "breasts and hips and not for gamines" or the androgynous clothes-hanger models that often dominate the catwalks.
 "We don't create fashion, we create personalities," he told AFP as he put the finishing touches to his "Storm dress", a silk gown entirely embroidered with goose feathers.
 "Whoever wears this after the coronavirus will be like an angel returning to Earth," Fournie declared.
 "I want to help my clients fulfil their destiny, support them, and help them take flight," he added with a flourish.

A chance encounter changed Dr. Jonathan Oline's life.
   
 While on vacation in Cody, Wyoming, in 2005, the Bucks County cardiologist met some members of the U.S. Army Special Forces staying at the same hotel. They mentioned the Army had a shortage of doctors to treat soldiers wounded in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   
 "They told me how badly they needed doctors overseas with two wars going on," he said.
   
 The idea stuck with him.
   
 He applied for the Army Reserve.
   
 "I have always believed I would be given the opportunity to serve my country in its time of need," he wrote in his application. He was accepted, as are other doctors, dentists, attorneys and chaplains who apply for direct commands into the services.
   
 Following six weeks of military training and on leave from his cardiology practice, the doctor started a six-month tour of duty in a combat hospital in Mosul, Iraq, during the height of U.S. military operations there in 2007-08. He treated American military members, civilians and enemy combatants injured in the war. Since then, he has also served as a flight surgeon in a combat support hospital in Kuwait during another tour of the Middle East a few years ago.
   
 This spring Oline worked on a different front line, when the Army was called to support hospitals overwhelmed with coroanvirus patients. He volunteered for the intensive care unit of John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, New Jersey. With his expertise in critical care, he knew he could be of use dealing with COVID-19 patients on ventilators.
   
 "It's a job that needed to be done," he said. "You do all the precautions as properly as you can but you still realize there's personal risk involved by doing this. You accept that risk to help the other patients."
   
 Oline, who lives in Middletown, is retired from his regular medical practice but has been promoted to colonel in the Army and has won a host of military commendations for his service.
   
 When he's home, he also volunteers as a firefighter with the Langhorne- Middletown Fire Co. State Rep. Frank Farry, R-142, who is company chief, said that he knew Oline served in some dangerous places overseas before training as a firefighter in 2016. "When you think of the totality of that, it's pretty impressive," he said.
   
 Oline said service to country is one of the reasons he's put himself out there like the Special Forces men he met more 15 years ago. "Honor and integrity still meant a lot to them," he said.
   
 While caring for wounded soldiers overseas and working with COVID-19 patients in an American hospital are different situations, he's found similarities in caring for gravely ill patients, some of whom won't survive, he said. "I think there's definitely some comparison," he said. "You have to detach a certain amount from the patients because they're so, so sick."
   
 But it doesn't mean you can't enjoy your work in helping those in need. "One of the things I always liked as a physician -- you get the opportunity to get to know people so they can develop trust," he said.
   
 At JFK hospital, Oline hung a big American flag. The cavalry had arrived.
   
 The Army doctor admits he likes working in situations where he's under the gun, so to speak.
   
 "I look forward to the challenge of working in emergencies where you need to stay calm," he said. "Even in a very stressful situation, you take pride in contributing ... and helping people."
   
 He didn't always have those feelings. Growing up in Cheltenham, Oline wanted to be a cabinetmaker. He liked working with his hands. But his dad was a chemist with Rohm & Haas and he was oriented toward math and science.
   
 As a student at LaSalle University, he was on the rowing team with other students who wanted to go into law or medicine. Oline decided he wanted to be a doctor, too. "I knuckled down and studied hard," he said.
   
 He graduated from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1983, where he later received the Outstanding Resident Award, and did fellowships in cardiology at Deborah Heart and Lung Center in Pemberton Township, New Jersey, and in interventional cardiology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.
   
 Now 62, he looks forward to four more years as a reservist. He passed his physical fitness test so the Army upped his enlistment until age 66.
   
 "God's been good to me," said the father of two grown sons. "I have a good career and a healthy family." Oline said the times have not always been easy, but he never regrets that he enlisted. "I'm Lutheran. I do read the Bible ... There's a lot to learn from the Old and New Testament."
   
 He takes special pride in his wife's understanding of his need to volunteer. "She understands it's something I need to do in life," he said. "She's accepted that I need to deploy at times ... I couldn't do it without her support."
   
 Adriana Oline said she misses her husband when he's gone but is proud that he wants to help others. "I believe he has an eagerness to drop everything and go. It makes him happy and I'm proud of him. He's a good soul," she said.
   
 The Army Reserve recently awarded Oline the Army Commendation Medal for "successfully supporting the nation during the COVID-19 response."
   
 Oline is taking a break now, but knows the Army may deploy him later this year to help with another medical emergency
   
 " Your greatest reward in life comes from helping other people," he said.

Most importantly, there are still no government guidelines on theatres reopening so the package might still end up as a sticking plaster. In other words, without an expected timetable it is still unclear as to whether they can plan for productions. And if they can’t, and with furloughing at an end, this money is going to be eaten up by staff costs. However, if rumours of the West End opening in October are true (and last week, the team behind The Mousetrap, the longest-running production in the world believed they would be back in business then), such fears might be diminished.

“For so many, life emerging from lockdown will not be the same as before for many reasons including loss of jobs, businesses, access to face-to-face support services they once had,” the pair told PEDESTRIAN.TV. The anxiety associated with this uncertainty and establishing a ‘new normal’ is difficult, they add.
 When it comes to the biology of all of this, of course, everyone is different, so the way we process these changes will differ across the board and can even alter the way your brain works. “Resilience and vulnerability are key variables for an individual’s ability to manage their mental health,” Nithianantharajar and Hill said.
 “Therefore, the ability to mentally process stressors from our environment and cope with uncertainties can trigger anxiety and depression. To shift your mindset and be flexible with dramatic changes to your daily life is indeed difficult and may change our brain function.”
 On top of all that, there are certain environmental factors that can influence the mental impact of these changes. “The way our brain responds to changing conditions is a product of both our genes and the environmental influences we are exposed to across our lives,” Nithianantharajar and Hill said.
 “These environmental influences can be good (stable relationships, healthy diet and exercise) and bad (unstable family life, poor physical health, drug abuse), and both shape the biology of our brain.”
 “Therefore, each individual will respond differently both to community and personal anxiety as well as general concerns of the COVID-19 situation. It comes back to the individual’s ability to flexibly shift our minds to embrace the new challenges ahead as we emerge out of lockdown to create safety and a new sense of returning to normal.”
