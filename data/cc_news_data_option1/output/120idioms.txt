DUBAI -- Tehran said on Friday it wanted to download black box recordings itself from a Ukrainian airliner crash that killed all 176 people aboard, after Canada and others said the plane was brought down by an Iranian missile, probably by mistake.


  Iran, which denies the Boeing 737-800 was downed by a missile, said it could take one or two months to extract information from the voice and flight data recorders.


  It said it may ask Russia, Canada, France or Ukraine for help in a probe that could take one or two years to complete.


  The Ukraine International Airlines flight to Kiev from Tehran crashed on Wednesday, when Iran was on alert for a U.S. military response hours after firing missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq. https://tmsnrt.rs/39MLwwx


  Most of the victims were Iranian or Iranian-Canadian.


  The crash has heightened international pressure on Iran after months of friction with the United States and tit-for-tat military strikes. Washington killed an Iranian general last week in a drone attack in Iraq, prompting Tehran's missile launches.


  "We do believe that it's likely that that plane was shut down by an Iranian missile," U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said of the Ukrainian jet crash at a briefing on additional U.S. sanctions against Iran.


  "We're going to let the investigation play out before we make a final determination," he added as Washington also announced sanction waivers for crash investigators.


  In an outpouring of grief, Iranians and others shared images from the crash site on social media.


  One showed a single child's red shoe in the dirt.


  Another on Twitter showed a selfie of a mother and daughter in their seats, sent to a loved one before takeoff.


  "Why were any civilian airlines flying out of Tehran airport in those conditions," a user named Shiva Balaghi tweeted.


  Ukraine is looking at various possible causes of the crash, including a possible attack by a Russian-made missile, a collision, an engine explosion or terrorism.


  'UNINTENTIONAL'


  On social media, many Iranians expressed anger that the plane was allowed to take off and voiced worries as images, which could not be independently verified, circulated on Twitter suggesting the crash site had been cleared by bulldozers.


  Iran's ambassador to Britain denied that.


  "We prefer to download the black boxes in Iran. But if we see that we can't do that because the boxes are damaged, then we will seek help," Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation, told a news conference in Tehran.


  State television earlier showed the battered black boxes, saying their information could be downloaded and analyzed.


  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, citing intelligence from Canada and other sources, blamed an Iranian surface-to-air missile for bringing down the plane that had 63 Canadians on board, although he said it "may well have been unintentional."


  Ukraine's general prosecutor has asked Canada to provide any information that may facilitate a criminal investigation.


  Russia's deputy foreign minister said Moscow saw no grounds to blame Iran for the crash, TASS news agency reported.


  France's BEA air accident agency said it would be involved in the investigation. BEA helped analyze data from the flight recorder of a Boeing that crashed in Ethiopia last year.


  A U.S. official, citing satellite data, said Washington had concluded with a high degree of certainty that anti-aircraft missiles brought down the plane in error.


  The official said the data showed the plane airborne for two minutes after departing Tehran when heat signatures of two missiles were detected. There was an explosion in the vicinity and heat data showed the plane on fire as it fell.


  'PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE'


  U.S. President Donald Trump said he believed "somebody could have made a mistake."


  But Iran denounced "psychological warfare" against it.


  "All those countries whose citizens were aboard the plane can send representatives and we urge Boeing to send its representative to join the process of investigating the black box," government spokesman Ali Rabiei said.


  U.S., Canadian and French representatives were to travel to Tehran to attend meetings for the investigation, Iranian state media reported. Washington and Ottawa do not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.


  Iran's civil aviation organization said in an initial report less than 24 hours after the incident that the three-year-old airliner, which had its last scheduled maintenance on Monday, encountered a technical problem after takeoff and was heading to a nearby airport before it crashed.


  The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it was making arrangements to tour the site after an Iranian invitation.


  The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it had designated a representative to join the probe.


  Boeing said it would support the NTSB. The company is reeling from two deadly crashes of 737 MAX planes, including the one in Ethiopia, that led to the model's grounding last year.


  The crash plane was built in 2016 and is the prior 737 generation before the MAX.

Preclinical research, conducted under NIH grants by scientists at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), demonstrated the safety and efficacy of G-NK cells administered in combination with a therapeutic monoclonal antibody. Clinical models of multiple myeloma and lymphoma demonstrated improved survival, a statistically significant decrease in tumor growth, and a statistically significant increase in the activity of the monoclonal antibody without causing graft-vs-host disease. When administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody, G-NK cells have been shown to be highly persistent (lasting four to nine months), to have the ability to preferentially bind to a therapeutic monoclonal antibody in the presence of a tumor cell, and to demonstrate superior ADCC function compared with conventional NK cells. Under a second Indapta NIH grant, researchers at Stanford University will be conducting in vivo studies in additional tumor models.

Medicaid work rules, in short, have turned out to be pound-foolish without ever having shown the virtue of being penny-wise.


  Official state statistics showed that by December 2018, the Arkansas policy had resulted in 17,000 residents losing their eligibility. That was enough to unnerve U.S. Judge James E. Boasberg, who last March ordered the policy suspended.


  Finding that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar hadn’t bothered to look into the possibility of mass disenrollments, Boasberg also blocked the Kentucky policy. His rulings that the approval of work rules by HHS was “arbitrary and capricious” under the law have prompted several of the other states contemplating such rules to think twice.

In October of 2018, a Boeing 737 Max jet crashed into the Java Sea, killing everyone on board. Five months later, another crashed in Ethiopia, taking the lives of all passengers and crew. The tragedies caused aviation authorities across the globe to ground all 737 Max jets, and both Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration began investigations into how these accidents occurred. _The Washington Post_ and _The New York Times_ obtained over 100 pages of email and chat transcripts that were handed over to Congress as part of its investigation. The documents show that employees mocked the planes' designers, calling them "clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys," and had major concerns over the safety of the planes. Even before the first crash, one employee asked, "Would you put your family on a Max simulator trained aircraft?" "No," a colleague replied.

“The second strategy is to sponsor a number of candidates to take over UNZALARU by way of capturing its leadership or advancing PF supporters to lead or run the Union and rendering it ineffective. In November this year, UNZALARU will hold general elections at which all executive positions will be up for grabs. As they did with the Law Association of Zambia, the PF has already identified a number of candidates that they hope to float for the different positions. Until recently, the PF were working with the second plan, but the recent strong language from the UNZALARU Executive prompted them to reinstate the first plan. You will recall that the government had attempted to deregister the Union last year over non-payment of gratuities, but the move was shelved after fears emerged that doing so might seriously disrupt the university calendar, which was already underway at the time. This time, they want to move quickly before the University reopens in February”.

" _Certains se demandent pourquoi nous devons avoir un excédent budgétaire alors qu'il existe tant de besoins. Un bon budget est un budget qui équilibre les multiples besoins auxquels nous devons répondre dans les différents domaines de la gouvernance_ ", indiquait la veille le Premier ministre António Costa. Réfutant que son budget soit le reflet d'une exigence de la Commission européenne, à laquelle le le projet de plan budgétaire 2020 a été soumis décembre 2019, il le dépeint comme un budget destiné à " _préparer l'avenir et à garantir que les Portugais n'aient plus à supporter les coûts d'une crise financières (...) La rigueur budgétaire nous donne la liberté._ " Pour son ministre des Finances, Mário Centeno, " _Ce budget est meilleur que celui de la législature précédente. Il est meilleur parce que les Portugais sont meilleurs (...) Il est basé sur des engagements sérieux et responsables et ne revient sur rien de ce qui a été proposé et voté par cette assemblée au cours des quatre dernière années._ " Selon lui, " _le Portugal ne vivra plus au détriment des impôts des générations futures._ "      Nommé en novembre 2015, António Costa gouverne depuis une union de la gauche. Pour réussir ce budget aux mesures ambitieuses, il compte sur une accélération de la demande extérieure, donc la croissance des exportations, grâce à la reprise de la croissance de la zone euro, son principal partenaire. Ainsi que sur la croissance des investissements publics qui passera de 9,7% en 2019 à 16,2% en 2020.

As previously announced by the president we are announcing additional sanctions against the Iranian regime. As a result of the attack on US and allied troops. First the president is issuing an executive order authorizing the imposition. Of additional sanctions against any individual owning. Operating. Trading Werth or assisting sectors. Of the I Rainier economy including construction. Manufacturing. Textiles and my neck and let me be clear if he's will be both primary and secondary sanctions. The EO also allows us. To designate other sectors in the future as secretary Pompeo. And me think is appropriate. Second we are announcing seventeen specific sanctions against our brand's largest steel and iron manufactures. Set three say shelf space and today's and a vessel involved in the transfer products. As result of these actions we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the our Iranian regime. And we will continue our enforcement. Of other and today's. Third we are taking action against eight senior are Iranian officials who advance the regime's destabilizing. Activity. And were involved in Tuesday's ballistic missile strike. Secretary Pompeo comment more on the house. Today sanctions are part of our commitment to stop Iranian regime's global terrorist activities. The president has been very clear. We will continue to apply economic sanctions. Until our ran stops its terrorist activities. And commit that it would never have nuclear weapons. I'll never turn it over to secretary Pompeo. Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. To their prison trip is delivering on the pledge that he made. The day after Iran attacked American forces in Iraq there will be a series of new sanctions. Second have been Nugent just mentioned. Eight senior Iranian officials that are responsible for the regime's violence both at home and abroad. But we're striking at the heart of the Islamic Republic's inner security apparatus. These sanctions targets include the secretary of the Supreme National Council and the commander of the besiege forces. That's the regime's brute squad. Which is the last few months killed approximately 15100. Iranians who were simply demanding freedom. Our action also targets other senior leaders close to the Ayatollah they've carried out his terrorist plots and destabilizing campaigns across the Middle East and around the world. They've employed soldiers across the region battlefield. They've trained militias in Iraq Syria and elsewhere in the arts of the master repression. Today there capital murder in May up the goal of our campaign. Is to deny either regime the resource to conduct its destructive foreign policy. We want Iran to simply behave like a normal nation we believe the sanctions that we impose today further that strategic objective. Our campaign is composed of diplomatic. Economic. Opponents. That deprived regime of billions in revenue the regime has used to fuel death and destruction across the Middle East and all across the world. Sadly the previous administration had opened up revenue streams for a run. But under arbitration revenue all revenues are down by 80% in Iran can not access roughly 90%. Of its foreign currency reserves. And not even two weeks ago president running around admitted that our sanctions have cost. Around over 200 billion dollars in Los sport income and investment. As long as a rather outlaws ways continue we will continue to impose sanctions. Finally I want to reiterate present from concern for Americans in dual national citizens descent detained inside of Iran. Iran knows they these individuals have committed no crime. They know the charges against them are fake we will do all that we can to get each of them returned home safely to their families. We had specific recommendation that information on an imminent threat and those threats shouldn't included attacks on US embassies period full stop. I think and he said he didn't know precisely wet.

Liberatore's curveball is a swing-and-miss hammer, thrown with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate, and he introduced a new, and very effective, slider during the spring. His diving changeup, meanwhile, is another promising pitch, one that plays nicely off his heater and could be his best secondary offering when all is said and done.

Medicaid work rules, in short, have turned out to be pound-foolish without ever having shown the virtue of being penny-wise.
 Official state statistics showed that by December 2018, the Arkansas policy had resulted in 17,000 residents losing their eligibility. That was enough to unnerve U.S. Judge James E. Boasberg, who last March ordered the policy suspended.
 Finding that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar hadn’t bothered to look into the possibility of mass disenrollments, Boasberg also blocked the Kentucky policy. His rulings that the approval of work rules by HHS was “arbitrary and capricious” under the law have prompted several of the other states contemplating such rules to think twice.

"It seems like Jimmy always goes after my eyeballs and I'm the Eyepoke God so it just makes sense.

"We showed that we could get one of those matches over and had people entertained. That sumb*tch Jimmy is still up to no good and had his ol' girl Priscilla hit me in the gonads and dropped me and ran off."


  Warner added that he doesn't know why Priscilla Kelly is with Jimmy, maybe for the money. But he says, it's just one more person he has to look out for.


  "If she wants to get involved then get on in there. There's barbed wire all around the ring so I'm not opposed to throwing a female into barbed wire out there," stated Warner.


  Havoc and Warner have engaged in a months-long feud and Warner was asked if this upcoming barbed wire match will finally be the culmination of that.


  "I've thought that before in other fights we've had, but now I'm not too sure," admitted Warner. "We could be doing this for years and years. Jimmy Havoc could be the guy that ol' Mancer fights for the next 10 years. There's no way to know for sure.

Si tratta di una scogliera della lunghezza di circa 50 metri resasi necessaria per mettere in sicurezza tutta la zona dove si trovano anche alcune attività produttive". In quel tratto, l'argine si era danneggiato durante le ultime ondate di piena ed era diventato estremamente fragile richiedendo un intervento in somma urgenza da parte della Regione Toscana, ente competente in materia, attraverso il Genio Civile di Pisa e lo stanziamento di 35.000 euro."I lavori non finiscono qui" continua Fanucchi "infatti più a valle, sempre sul Rio Fossanuova ma in sponda sinistra, sempre il Genio Civile, sta attualmente lavorando a un ripristino arginale prima della Baracca di Nanni, in prossimità di una altro intervento portato a termine sempre dalla Regione alcuni anni fa". Durante l'ultima piena di novembre, nell'argine erano comparsi alcuni fontanazzi molto pericolosi, evidenziati dalla Protezione Civile Croce Verde di Porcari durante il monitoraggio del territorio; il Comune lo aveva segnalato tempestivamente sia al Consorzio di Bonifica che alla Regione Toscana e, come avviene di norma, il Genio Civile è intervenuto tempestivamente per la risoluzione del problema.

So far, the investigations indicate that the 737 Max's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System is the main culprit in the crashes. This software manipulates the plane's hardware to give the pilot a particular feel when adjusting pitch. While designing the plane, Boeing made frequent changes to the code but did not adequately explain these adjustments to the FAA, resulting in a shoddy safety analysis. The faulty MCAS automatically put the planes into nosedives, causing the two deadly crashes.


  The transcripts also make it clear that Boeing was trying to save a substantial amount of money for the airlines that bought the 737 Max by convincing the FAA that simulator training for the new jets was unnecessary. These simulators aren't simple computer set-ups -- they're detailed and expensive recreations of planes that are propped on hydraulic supports so that pilots can get a true-to-life feel of the aircraft.


  In March of 2017, the 737 chief technical pilot told his colleagues to "stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required." He wrote that Boeing would "go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement." In June 2017, the pilot wrote about his success in convincing an airline not to require simulator training, saying, "Looks like my Jedi mind trick worked again! These are not the droids you're looking for." Even after the crashes, the company insisted that pilots shouldn't have to train in mock-ups of the 737 Max, but reversed its stance earlier this week.


  "These communications do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable," Boeing said in a statement. We regret the content of these communications, and apologize to the FAA, Congress, our airline customers and to the flying public for them. We have made significant changes as a company to enhance our safety processes, organizations, and culture. The language used in these communications, and some of the sentiments they express, are inconsistent with Boeing values, and the company is taking appropriate action in response."  


  In the wake of the crashes and investigations, the 737 Max planes have been grounded for longer than any other aircraft, and Boeing has lost over $10 billion. The company decided to halt production of the planes until the investigations are completed and even ousted its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. With both the FAA and Congress continuing their investigations into the 737 Max, there's no telling if or when they'll take flight again.
