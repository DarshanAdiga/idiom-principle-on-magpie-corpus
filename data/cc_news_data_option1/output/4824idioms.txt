Grant County Commissioners Jim Hamsher and Sam Palmer were among 51 elected officials who signed a letter asking Gov. Kate Brown to reopen bars, restaurants, schools, state offices and churches.
 The letter, sent from state Sen. Lynn Findley’s office Nov. 18, said a “one- size-fits-all” approach was logical at the start of the pandemic, but since then, communities have “adjusted, adapted and improved.”
 Findley, a Republican from Vale, said he and other legislators had been working on drafts of the letter for about three weeks before sending it to the governor’s office.
 Findley, whose district includes parts of 11 counties, said his main goal is to promote a “dialogue” between the governor and other state officials and legislators, county commissioners, school administrators and other local officials in rural counties.
 He said he wants the state to give more autonomy to local officials in designing strategies to combat the spread of COVID-19.
 He notes that during the spring, the state required counties to submit detailed plans for state approval before moving into Phase 1, which relaxed some of the restrictions on businesses, church services and other activities that the governor had imposed in March at the outset of the pandemic.
 Findley contends that approach “is totally ignored now.”
 Palmer said Brown has handed down “edicts.” The elected officials, he said, want to be a part of the conversation about the restrictions, instead of getting an order that says, “This is what we’re doing.”
 In the past, he said, rural leaders had to make an effort, as schools closed during the first lock down, to lobby the governor to adjust the metrics so schools could reopen.
 Rep. Mark Owens, R-Crane, and other local leaders in Owens’ district, including Palmer and Hamsher, were in on calls to give Owens their thoughts to take to Salem.
 Hamsher, who said he is on weekly calls with the governor’s office and the White House regarding the pandemic, said local leaders know more about their communities than anyone.
 The elected officials said in the letter that they have safely met with school superintendents, the Oregon Department of Education director, county sheriffs, county public health authorities and agency representatives to discuss how to move forward.
 They write that nearly half of the restaurants and bars in their respective communities risk closing in six months. According to the letter, the data shared by state health officials does not show that restaurants and bars cause the spike in cases.
 “Our hospitality industry is responsible for employing tens of thousands of Oregonians and keeping our already fragile economy moving,” the elected officials said in the letter.
 The elected officials said schools need to fully reopen for in-classroom learning. The students should also be allowed to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities, they said. Distance learning should still be available for teachers, students, staff and volunteers who choose not to return to in-person classes.
 “If it is safe for college athletes to return to sports,” they said, “assuredly, it is safe for high school students.”
 They said that parents need to go back to work, and students and teachers need the classroom’s stability.
 The letter said that state agencies need to reopen at all levels, including the Department of Motor Vehicles.
 The state agencies and their employees, the letter said, are “essential.” They said the offices are funded with public dollars, and the public needs full access to these essential services.
 The elected officials asked the governor to “release our churches and places of worship.” While there have been a couple of “outliers,” on the whole, congregations have been more “scrupulous” about protecting themselves from COVID-19, they said.
 “Give pastors, religious leaders, and governing boards the latitude to exercise their best judgment for safety,” the letter states.

Bratzler said he doesn’t think the university will move fully online for the spring, even amid the rising cases in Oklahoma — a sentiment echoed by Fritzen.
 “My best prediction for the spring is very much what fall looked like. I can't think of any exceptions to that, you will have a similar setup in the classroom. We will have a similar balance of online, hybrid and in-person courses — at least, that is intended right now,” Fritzen said. “We're trying to fix the schedule as we speak, but it looks like it will be roughly in the same parameters. So I suspect all of the same flexibilities.”
 In a previous interview with The Daily, Bratzler said he expected there would be “a bit more” flexibility allowed to students regarding their preferences for in-person or remote classes.
 However, the spring semester will look different for international students due to the transition with the U.S. presidency per Nima Zecavati, the university’s immigration counsel.
 Zecavati said the difference for international students will be “night and day” as the country begins the transition to President-elect Joseph Biden's administration.
 “(Biden’s) already stated that he intends to reinstate some of the restrictions that have been put on the DACA program on his first day. The Muslim travel ban, for our students from places like Iran, will be removed on the first day, according to President-elect Biden,” Zecavati said. “So there are a number of things that he can do very quickly, but there were four years of regulations that were put in place and obviously those will take years to undo.”

HELENE K. SUDMEIER Amana 1934 – 2020 Helene Sudmeier, 86, most recently of Amana, Iowa, formerly of Earlville, passed away Saturday, Nov. 21, 2020, at the Guttenberg Municipal Hospital. Helene Berns Sudmeier was born to Louis and Clara Harter Berns on April 15, 1934. The eighth child in a family of nine, she loved reminiscing about growing up with much-loved siblings on their busy family farm near Garnavillo, Iowa. Being one of the youngest siblings, Helene would often spend time helping her older siblings as they busily grew their families. This interaction fostered many close relationships with her nieces and nephews, leading Helene to remark that they often seemed more like little sisters and brothers. The warm relationships Helene had with her extended family gave her joy all the days of her life. Helene had a joyful, merry personality and loved to tell stories of her early memories of James (Jim) Sudmeier, whom she met as a teenager when her sister Laura married Jim's brother. She shyly noted he was tall and handsome, had an easy smile and a gentle manner. It was a great joy when she became Jim's wife in August of 1957, and they settled on a farm between Petersburg and New Vienna, Iowa. On this simple and lovely farm they would start their family, and continue to add to it when they eventually settled into a large family home in Earlville, Iowa. Although Helene had many talents and interests, she would always consider her family her "magnum opus" or great work. Born to Helene and Jim would be six children: Russell (Rosalie) Sudmeier of New Vienna, Iowa, Susanne Sudmeier (Moses de los Santos) of Amana, Iowa, Jessica (Carlos) Garcia of San Diego, Calif., John Sudmeier of Manchester, Iowa, Sara (Fred) Osborne of Wilmette, Ill., and Jayne Sudmeier of Dubuque, Iowa. Helene also had 11 grandchildren, Molly McAndrew of Dyersville, James and Robert Sudmeier of New Vienna, Brighton and Kanan de los Santos of Melbourne, Australia, Rio de los Santos of Amana, Gabriel and Isabel Garcia of San Diego, Felicia Sudmeier of Nashville, Tenn., and Lilia Rose and Keoni Osborne of Wilmette, Ill. In terms of family, the icing on the cake for Helene were her four lively and adorable great-grandsons! Helene will be remembered for her quick smile and generous nature. She was very creative and dove into everything with a "can-do" attitude. She enjoyed reading, gardening, sewing up a storm, crocheting and just about anything else she set her hands and mind to. After raising her family in Earlville, Helene spent many years living in Dubuque before joining her daughter Susanne and family (Moses and Rio) in Amana, Iowa. Many people recount her zest for walking the sidewalks of Amana tirelessly with a smile on her face. Helene enjoyed the community and people of Amana the five years she lived there. Helene's final year was spent at the River Living Center in Guttenberg, where she was especially delighted to be in the company of her sister, Laura Sudmeier. She loved the River Living Center and remarked frequently about how much she enjoyed the great food and life there. Helene was preceded in death by her parents; beloved husband, Jim; and siblings, Peter Berns, Roland Berns, Claudine Goedken, Clara Ann Neuhaus and Aloys Berns. In addition to her offspring, Helene is survived by sisters, Laura Sudmeier of Guttenberg and Mary Krapfl of New Vienna; brother, Louis Berns of Monona, Iowa; and sister-in-law, Rosie Berns of Garnavillo, Iowa. Visitation for Helene will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. Friday, Nov. 27, at Clifton-Murdoch Funeral Home in Earlville, Iowa. Per the Governor's proclamation, a limited number of guests will be allowed in the funeral home at a time. A funeral Mass will be celebrated in her honor at 10 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 28, at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Earlville. Burial will take place at St. Joseph Catholic Cemetery in Earlville. Due to current pandemic guidelines, all guests are required to wear a face mask and practice social distancing at all services. Please share a memory of Helene at www.murdochfuneralhome.com under obituaries.

To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering eBay's $18.42 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.42. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.

Highest number of formal jobs so far in the current fiscal were created in the month of September under both the Employees Provident Fund Organisation and the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation, signalling a pick up in demand for formal workers in the country. Even subscription to the National Pension Scheme has been rising month-on-month after touching the lowest in the current fiscal in June. The payroll data of the ministry of statistics and programme implementation, released on Wednesday, shows the net new additions under the EPFO stood at 14.9 lakh while the number of newly registered employees under ESIC stood at 11.4 lakh in September. New subscribers under NPS in the month under consideration stood at 39,194. However, the highest contribution under the scheme in the current fiscal was in April at 64,647 followed by May at 43,888, largely on the back of last- minute investment to the scheme to avail tax exemptions. According to the data, the number of people who ceased to contribute to EPFO was lowest in September in the current fiscal at 2.80 lakh while the number of people who exited and rejoined the scheme in the month under consideration stood at 7.23 lakh. The net new enrolments with the EPFO hover around 7 lakh every month on an average. With the imposition of lockdown in the last week of March, the net enrolments in EPFO fell to 5.72 lakh in March 2020 from 10.21 lakh in February. During 2019-20, the number of net new subscribers rose to 78.58 lakh as compared to 61.12 lakh in the preceding fiscal. While EPF is applicable to establishments having more than 20 workers earning wages up to Rs 15,000 a month, ESIC applies to firms and establishments with 10 or more employees with wages up to Rs 21,000 a month. “In view of the national lockdown consequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, several establishments were closed and which may have had implications on the reporting. The reported figures are thus likely to undergo significant revision in the next few months,” Mospi said in a statement. Mospi has been bringing out the employment related statistics in the formal sector covering the period September 2017 onwards, using information on the number of subscribers who have subscribed under three major schemes, namely the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Scheme, the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) Scheme and the National Pension Scheme (NPS).
