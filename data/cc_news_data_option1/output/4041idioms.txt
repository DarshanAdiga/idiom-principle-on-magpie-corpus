With a view to preventing the flow of untreated sewage into the open in rural areas, the Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat will direct multi-storeyed apartments to construct sewage treatment plants (STPs) on their premises. The gram panchayats concerned will issue notices to such buildings to get STPs built in three months, Chief Executive Officer R. Selvamani said on Thursday.
 Speaking at the general meeting of the panchayat here, Mr. Selvamani said that notices would be served on all apartments that were letting out untreated sewage into the open. “They (apartment owners/residents association) would be given three months to set up STPs. If they fail to set up STPs, the panchayats would take action,” he said.
 Mr. Selvamani told reporters later that the panchayats would withdraw no objection certificates issued to such residential apartments. In case of commercial complexes, the panchayats would not renew trade licence.

Tiruchi
 Connectivity issue hits the biometric authenticated Public Distribution System (PDS) in different parts of the district.
 The system, aimed at preventing bogus transactions at ration shops and unauthorised use of ration cards, has been implemented in the district since August 1. Tiruchi was one among the four districts in the State where the new system was introduced on a pilot basis. As per the system, the cardholders will have to authorise themselves by placing their thumb on the biometric devices at the ration shops for getting the commodities. The salesmen have been asked to distribute PDS items only after the device reads and authenticates the thumb impression.
 However, complaints have cropped up in different parts, mainly rural areas, of the districts that cardholders were forced to wait in long queues for a long time to draw the commodities. There were instances of customers, after standing in queues for long, returning home without buying the commodities. Connectivity issues were said to be the reason for the delay.
 “I waited for more than two hours on Wednesday to buy commodities at a ration shop on Nelson Road in Thiruvanaikoil. Since the biometric device failed to read the thumb impressions, many cardholders were asked to visit the shop the next day. We often face the problem,” says S. Subramani, a cardholder in Thiruvanaikoil.
 Enquiries revealed that many ration shops in rural areas had been facing the issue. It was acute in the ration shops at Kannuthur, Inamputhur, Vaiyamalapalayam, Elaman and Purathakudi villages in Manapparai and Vaiyampatti unions. Poor internet connectivity and server issues were leading to problems in completing the sales process. Though the new system was in force since August 1, the issue had turned worse over the past week.
 “We cannot complete the sale process unless the biometric device reads the thumb impression of the cardholders. Hence, distribution is slowed down. However, the situation is gradually improving,” A. Sahayaraj, a salesman at a ration shop at Purathakudi near Vaiyampatti.
 Anbalagan, District Supply Officer, when contacted told _The Hindu_ that the system, which was introduced in Tiruchi on August 1, had been extended to other districts in the State since October 1. There has been teething troubles here and there. There were some glitches on the server for an hour on Wednesday and Thursday. However, the issues had been resolved quickly. It would stabilise in the days to come, he said.

Ohio lawmakers have scrapped a controversial amendment that would take away local control over sales of dogs at pet stores. But the issue is simply taking a different form.
 A Senate committee pulled the amendment that was attached to a tax bill and is instead making it a stand-alone bill. The ASPCA's Vicki Deisner opposes the legislation that would take away a community’s authority to ban sales of some dogs in pet stores, as Grove City and Toledo have done.
 “It preempts pet stores locally from deciding if they want to support the cruelty of puppy mills.”
 Deisner supports offering only dogs from rescue or humane organizations. Petland’s Elizabeth Kunzleman says her organization does not purchase dogs from puppy mills and insists most are healthy.
 “Less than 5 percent had any medical issue. Less than 1 percent had any congenital or hereditary issue.”
 Kunzleman says her company has 17 pet stores in Ohio and cannot operate with 17 different sets of rules.

While it’s been a hectic 2020 for everybody, many are still hard at work organizing projects and community activities. One of those groups hard at work is the Norwood Young America Lions Club. Meetings may be difficult, but this doesn’t mean that they’ve been silent during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several projects, scholarships, and activities in the works, and while some needed to be cancelled, they have still been working on ways to involve the community.
 “We’ve had to cancel quite a few things, like our Sweet Corn Feed during Music in the Park,” said David Williams, outreach coordinator for the NYA Lions. “We’ve been pretty quiet because many people that come to our events are elderly, and we don’t want anybody getting sick.”
 Like with all of us, the pandemic changed up how the NYA Lions did their work. The Sweet Corn Feed, for example, was cancelled because Music in the Park was cancelled. However, that doesn’t mean that folks in need won’t be receiving their sweetcorn. They have simply adapted to a new plan, which will be donating the corn to the local Foodshelf. The Pancake Feeds are more complicated, since that involved making and distributing food, so these were put on hold for the time being.
 Food related projects aren’t the only thing the NYA Lions do, though. For the last few years, they’ve been working on gathering funds for a renovation of the NYA Sports Complex. Just this year, they reached their goal of $70,000 to get the project started. The renovation will be done with the help of the city as well, and the plan is to make the Sports Complex bigger, which would allow more people to utilize the facility.
 “We’re planning to start next spring because the price of all the lumber is expensive right now,” said Williams. “The plan is to double the size of the building.”
 The funds were mainly raised from the pull tabs and donations from the community. With the Sports Complex project approved by the city, it’s now just a waiting game until spring.
 As for projects coming up, one give-back to the community the NYA Lions have always done is delivering poinsettias to the seniors of NYA at Peace Villa, the Harbor, and Haven. With residents having a pretty lonely year, this project has been a priority to support them through a trying time.

The best place to experience Armstrong’s perennially galvanising effect is the astonishing set of records he made between 1925 and 1929, collectively known as his _Hot Fives and Sevens_. These dazzling small-group performances transformed jazz once and for all, from a jolly accompaniment for dancing to a language of limitless expressive power and virtuosity. Wonders abound, from the breathtaking stop-time solos in ‘Cornet Chop Suey’ and ‘Potato Head Blues’, to the perfect structure of ‘Savoy Blues’, and the exuberant swing and effortless technical fireworks of ‘Hotter Than That’. Besides his startling playing, Armstrong’s unique scat vocals brought a new dimension to improvisation: a piece like ‘Heebie Jeebies’ seems an outpouring of pure joy, a song that doesn’t need words to convey its rhythmic and melodic gusto. And on the magnificent ‘West End Blues’. his trumpet and vocal powers combine to produce a masterpiece of searing emotion.

But it’s Boimler shooting his shot — hoping to use his connection to her to get a promotion to the _Sacramento_ — that really hits Mariner hard. Deciding the only way to escape the hell of pleasantries she’s in is to leave the _Cerritos_ altogether, she attempts to become the model candidate for the _Sacremento_ promotion instead, putting her in Boimler’s persnickety crosshairs. Or, rather, would, if the duo’s fracturing relationship wasn’t rudely interrupted by the Bridge Officer’s A-plot of the week crashing in (almost literally). On what Captain Freeman assumes to be a routine check-up with the U.S.S. _Solvang_ after a distress call, the _Cerritos_ finds itself assaulted by a Pakled fleet — no more the seemingly dumb con artists they were when Picard and crew fought them in _TNG_ , but now a…slightly less dumb but much more threatening group of pirate raiders, relying on the galaxy’s low assumptions of them to overwhelm and literally tear apart ships for tech.
 With the _Cerritos_ being sliced to pieces and Pakled’s boarding the ship — critically wounding Freeman as the Bridge Crew and the Lower Deckers desperately fight to hold off the inevitable against a surprisingly unstoppable force — everything suddenly feels… well, very _Star Trek_. Not _Star Trek_ in the way _Lower Decks_ has been, in its earnestly sincere manner, but a classic finale cut from the same cloth as the greats of the franchise came before it. OK, so maybe scale-wise it’s more of a “Basics” than it is a “Best of Both Worlds,” but for these characters? It’s big. And also, weirdly a lot like a _Star Trek_ finale we got earlier this year with _Picard_.
 Whether it’s the base-under-siege framing or the fact that for the second time running Will Riker shows up in a Captain’s chair to save the day (this time aboard the _Titan_ , and this time with Deanna Troi at his side!), at points “No Small Parts” evokes the same sort of nostalgia-yearning that _Picard_ ’s “Et in Arcadia Ego, Part 2” did earlier this year — sorry, time-dilation fans, that really was still 2020 seven million years ago. But while _Picard_ ’s sudden dip into nostalgia it had keenly avoided for much of its first season felt sour, here the arrival of familiar faces to save the day feels triumphant, even if _Lower Decks_ had already spent its season gleefully trafficking in jokey nostalgic celebrations of _Star Trek_ tropes.

Perhaps best of all? Folks that purchase _Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate_ will have "krossplay" support in select modes. That means plays on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series consoles, and Xbox One will be able to fight each other.

 As noted above, _Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate_ is set to release on November 17th for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series consoles, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Google Stadia. It includes basically everything released up to this point for the fighting game alongside the new Kombat Pack 2 DLC. Notably, the video game will largely be available digitally only on November 17th with physical versions releasing for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series consoles, and Xbox One.

But there’s also the politics of it. Cuomo seems like one prickly alpha. The statement he made in response to the criticism by Fithian and Cineworld chief Mooky Greidinger was scalding and doesn't suggest he's open to negotiate, particularly when COVID cases are on the rise in Brooklyn and Queens. Picking a fight with Cuomo is something you do when you’re out of options and your back is to the wall. That suggests that Fithian and Greidinger understand the economics of blockbuster moviemaking. If something costs $300 million to produce and another $200 million to market, which a Bond movie easily does, you need to earn more than $800 million globally to break even (theater owners and studios essentially split ticket sales). You can’t reach those numbers without New York City, which is both a major source of box office revenue and a nucleus of taste-making. And if there are no blockbusters to screen, there’s no theater business. And if there’s no theater business, that means tens of thousands of people lose their jobs and there’s a cascade of bankruptcies.

It’s not the disaster you might have expected, although still incredibly embarrassing for Mariner. No one is mad at Captain Freeman for hiding her familial link, and although Mariner is deeply upset at Boimler for, even inadvertently, exposing it, the problems it creates now is that instead of being mad at her all the time, the entire crew just wants to kiss her arse. It’s a fascinating moment of despair for Mariner in light of last week’s emotional resolution that she really did care about the people around her in Starfleet beyond her anti-authoritarian persona. Now she finds everyone, _including_ some of her friends, putting on fake fineries and compliments in the hopes getting in with the Captain’s daughter will get them ahead.

Germline testing assesses genetic changes carried in all the cells of the body, changes that a person already has from conception, while tumor profiling (somatic) sequencing analyzes alterations in DNA within a tumor that are often acquired and drive its growth, particularly for patients with advanced disease. While tumor sequencing can detect both somatic and some germline mutations, the most commonly ordered tests fall short in reporting pathogenic germline gene variants because of technical limitations and variant interpretation differences. This germline information can inform a wide range of clinical decisions, from prognosis to precision therapy selection, surgical decisions, reproductive choices and clinical trial qualification. In addition, germline genetic information has important implications for the families of cancer patients who may be at elevated risk of developing cancer themselves.

The Christmas Tree Lot will still be taking place as well this year, since this is a pretty low contact event and takes place outside. Aside from the volunteers wearing masks, the plan is the same as usual; set up the Friday after Thanksgiving in the Carquest parking lot and selling trees for the holiday season. All proceeds from the Christmas Tree Lot go straight back into the community.
 In fact, all funds given to the NYA Lions go straight into the community. Sometimes the funds are used for big projects, like the Sports Complex. Most of the time, though, the projects are smaller in scope. These include scholarships, students of the month, helping fund local projects and needs such as new fences and even helping fund medical needs. One of Williams’ favorite projects happened around the time he was recruited, in fact.
 “We had a little girl come to us that couldn’t hear, and we helped fund her cochlear implant,” he said. “That’s one of the coolest projects I’ve been a part of. We helped her hear for the first time.”
 One ongoing project for the NYA Lions, though, has been recruitment. Just recently, they’ve been updating their social media to keep the public apprised of their activities. The hope is being more visible, more people will be interested in helping out.
 “We do a lot of projects throughout the year, and many hands make light work,” said Williams. “When I joined, I’d not heard of them before and I told them that they’re the best kept secret.”
 With everything going on, there’s no better time to get involved, and according to Williams, membership can be as involved as someone wants it. Some members show up to every meeting, giving lots of input and ideas for future projects. Others may not, but still sign up as volunteers for events and work when they can. And while there are two separate Lions Clubs in NYA, which are the NYA Lions and the West Carver Lions, both accept any and all of often work together on projects. While each have some specialties, such as the Harvest Party and the pull tabs(West Carver and NYA Lions respectively).
 The best way to get in touch with the NYA Lions is to reach out to Williams by giving him a call at 952-500-2378 or at davidmichaelwilliams@aol.com. Whether you need help with a project or a sponsor, or want to help be the sponsor, Lions Clubs are still hard at work.
