Part of that history was on display during the presentation itself when Kerrville architect Scott Schellhase made the presentation on how the building, which was constructed in the 1910s, would be transformed into a three-story museum and research center. Schellhase’s family once owned the home and made many improvements to it through the years. While Schellhase never lived there, he was key in helping his parents improve the home in the 1990s.
 The project would also feature enhancements to the grounds of the Butt- Holdsworth Memorial Library, improved access to the Guadalupe River and a connection point to the proposed Kerrville Urban Trails System, which is moving along through its fundraising stage now.
 There has been a lot of discussion about what Kerrville wants to be. We believe this project delivers on the promise of this community and builds upon our unique identity and place in the Hill Country, where the beautiful Guadalupe River is at the centerpiece. The improved library and museum campus, along with the KUTS plan, could showcase what’s possible for those wanting to come to Kerrville, including new businesses and new residents. It’s certainly a bright vision for what we hope will come together.
 This is a good project. It needs our support; but, most importantly, it needs the support of all from this great community.

Los jovenes y las mujeres son los dos colectivos que lideraron la subida record de la contratacion indefinida durante 2019 en la Region, segun ponen de manifiesto los datos de la Consejeria de Empleo, Investigacion y Universidades. Murcia batio el pasado año su record anual de nuevos contratos fijos a trabajadores, que alcanzaron los 92.882, lo que supone 1.863 mas que el año anterior.


  Este repunte ha beneficiado especialmente a los menores de 30 años, que firmaron un 7,50 por ciento mas de contratos fijos que en 2018, es decir, un dato mas de cinco puntos superior al aumento del 2,05 por ciento del empleo estable en el conjunto de la poblacion. En total, el numero de contratos fijos formalizados a jovenes el pasado año fue de 28.006, frente a los 26.053 de 2018.


  Estas cifras reflejan que tres de cada diez contratos indefinidos que se firmaron durante 2019 en la Region tuvieron como protagonista a un menor de 30 años. Los contratos temporales a este grupo de la poblacion tambien crecieron, si bien con menor intensidad que los estables (un 2,09 por ciento), lo que se traduce en un progresivo descenso de la temporalidad en este colectivo.


  La distribucion de contratos fijos por tramos de edad tambien muestra que se produjo un descenso del 1,37 por ciento de estos vinculos laborales en los trabajadores de entre 30 y 44 años, al pasar de los 40.643 nuevos contratos fijos de 2018 a los 40.085 de 2019 (558 menos).


  Por el contrario, se produjo un aumento del 1,92 por ciento en los contratos estables entre los mayores de 45 años (468 mas, para llegar a un total de 24.791 en 2019), aunque esa escalada fue menos significativa que entre los jovenes.


  En cuanto a las mujeres, los contratos fijos pasaron de los 35.308 de 2018 a los 37.777 de 2019, es decir, 2.469 mas, para un aumento del 6,99 por ciento que supera en casi cinco puntos el incremento medio en el conjunto de la poblacion.


  Estos datos contrastan con la caida del 1,09 por ciento de la contratacion fija entre los hombres (bajo de los 55.711 contratos estables de 2018 a los 55.105 de 2019, es decir, 606 menos).


  Por sectores economicos, la construccion y la agricultura registraron los mayores aumentos de la contratacion indefinida, con subidas del 7,17 por ciento y el 4,46 por ciento respectivamente. Estas cifras se traducen en que en 2019 se firmaron 308 contratos indefinidos mas en la construccion (hasta alcanzar un total de 4.606) y 1.291 mas en la agricultura (hasta llegar a los 30.210 indefinidos).


  El consejero de Empleo, Investigacion y Universidades, Miguel Motas, valoro que «la contratacion indefinida continua creciendo a mayor ritmo que la temporal, y esta en cifras nunca alcanzadas antes. Ademas, de este aumento se han beneficiado en mayor medida dos colectivos de especial interes para el empleo como las mujeres y los jovenes, lo cual es una muy buena noticia».


  Segun la ultima Encuesta de Poblacion Activa (EPA), el 65,3 por ciento de asalariados de la Region cuentan actualmente con un contrato laboral indefinido. En total, hay 522.300 los trabajadores por cuenta ajena en la Region y de ellos, 341.200 disponen de un contrato indefinido (5.900 mas que hace un año).


  Otro de los indicadores de la calidad del empleo es la proporcion de trabajadores ocupados que desarrollan una jornada a tiempo completo en la Region de Murcia, una variable que se situa a dia de hoy en el 86,1 por ciento (frente al 85,2 por ciento de hace un año). En terminos absolutos, los trabajadores con contrato a tiempo completo son 532.200 (25.300 mas que hace un año).

Low speed electric vehicles can be defined as electric vehicles which have four wheels and within one mile, can reach a speed of more than 20 mph and a maximum speed of 25 mph. Moreover, according to the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles, low speed electric vehicles should have a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 3,000 pounds. These vehicles can have manual as well as automatic transmission. However, these vehicles are quite different from golf carts and the two should not be confused with each other. The low speed electric vehicles market is consolidated in nature with few key players registering significant market share in the global market. This makes it a fertile market for the numerous upcoming players to expand their product portfolio and thus, give the necessary boost to the market’s revenue stream. Low speed electric vehicles can be used for different purposes, including utility application and off-roading. Moreover, low speed electric vehicles make an efficient and cost effective way of transportation and this is expected to create opportunities for the augmentation of the market.

       The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) held a high level policy dialogue on land reform and social economic transformation here on Thursday.      Speaking at the event, UNECA Regional Director for Southern Africa Said Adejumobi said the dialogue will address how to efficiently manage land for inclusive growth, industrialization and social economic development. Land reform is perhaps the most important contemporary issue of public policy that poses difficulty in Southern Africa.      The dialogue needs to come up with ways of balancing the demand for land redistribution with imperative increase of agricultural productivity and with enhanced agro-processing capacity, he said.      For his part, Botswana's Minister of Land Management, Water and Sanitation Services Kefentse Mzwinila said land reform is a key and strategic part for overall socio-economic transformation, and the Botswana government believes that an improved land administration system is "a prerequisite for economic development."      The dialogue provided stakeholders to share experience on land reforms and development in Southern Africa through discussions on land ownership and productivity, markets and policy.

Naomi Osaka said she had been overwhelmed by the pressure of defending her Australian Open title and admitted she does not have a "champion mentality" after losing to 15-year-old Coco Gauff on Friday.
 The 22-year-old Japanese made the startling admission after a surprise 6-3, 6-4 third-round defeat to the unseeded American, a loss she said she took "very personally".
 The third seed said that she "loved" Gauff, but added: "You don't want to lose to a 15-year-old."
 There was intense interest in the build-up to their second ever match, which was touted as a glimpse into the future of women's tennis.
 Two-time Grand Slam champion Osaka crushed a tearful Gauff in the US Open third round, but the teenager -- the youngest player in the Melbourne draw -- got emphatic revenge.
 "I don't really have the champion mentality yet, which is someone that can deal with not playing 100 percent (but still win)," said Osaka.
 "And I have always wanted to be like that, but I guess I still have a long way to go.
 "It's just something that I think some people are born with and some people have to have really hard, trials and stuff, to get it."
 Osaka, who has spoken openly about her struggles with nerves, told reporters she had not dealt well with the "hype" leading into the match or the expectations placed on her as defending champion.
 "I feel like I get tested a lot. Like life is just full of tests and, unfortunately for me, my tests are tennis matches and you guys see them," she said.
 "So I just have to find a way to navigate through it.
 "I feel like there are moments where I can handle them and you guys see that.
 "Then there are moments like this where I get overwhelmed and I don't really know what to do in the situation."
 Osaka said that she was particularly disappointed by her failure to win in front of her watching parents.
 "You don't want to lose to a 15-year-old," the Japanese said.
 "But I guess that's for me a reality check.
 "It doesn't really matter the age of the opponent."

In the last six-to-eight months, we have witnessed Tata Sky slashing the price of its HD Set-Top-Box and now the company has dropped the price for the fifth time. The company has bought down the price of the Set- Top-Box by Rs. 400. Back in October 2019, the company introduced an offer under which the HD Set-Top-Box was up for grabs at Rs. 1,199.Once again the company has proposed a limited period special offer which is offering the HD Set-Top-Box for Rs. 1,399. However, the company has not confirmed any deadline for the offer. Tata Sky with 31.61 percent market share is the largest DTH service provider in the country. Currently, the company is offering the cheapest Set-Top-Box under the offers, though there are certain terms and condition applied on SD and HD STBs. Tata Sky has recently launched its Sky Binge+ Android TV STB with a price tag of Rs. 5,999 which is quite costly when compared to the rival operators. Under the special offer, the company is offer HD STB at Rs. 1,399 which is equal to the cost of SD STB. It seems that with this move the company is eyeing to boost the number of its overall HD connections. Dont get carried away with the offer price because this is just the connection charges and on top of that you have to pay the additional installation charges and engineer visiting fee. If youre willing to switch SD to HD STB then the upgrade charges will be Rs. 1,199 for the STB. Tata Sky Binge+ at Rs. 5,999Tata Sky 4K at Rs. 6,400Tata Sky +HD at Rs. 9,300The price of the Tata Sky Android TV box remains same, lets see when the DTH operator will slash down the price of Android TV box as well.

A blueish glow spreads across the snow as far as the eye can see, a few bare trees dotting the windy plateau. In this remote corner of Norway's far north, two French adventurers are training for their next big exploit.
 Next month, Matthieu Bellanger and Loury Lag, both in their 30s, will leave eastern Canada for Alaska in a 130-day expedition passing through the famed Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.
 They also plan to climb Denali, the highest peak in North America known formerly as Mount McKinley.
 They have come to Alta, located at a latitude of 69.5 North, to seek out conditions similar to the extreme latitudes where they're headed, where temperatures easily plummet to minus 25 or minus 30 Celsius (minus 13 to minus 22 Fahrenheit).
 Unfortunately, the Norwegian winter is a little mild this year, with the mercury dropping to just minus 5C (23F) during the day and minus 10C (14F) at night. But at least a snowstorm has brought a good dumping of the white stuff.
 There are only four hours of daylight at this time of year, in the morning. The sky is whitish-blue, the sun barely managing to creep above the horizon.
 The tattooed adventurers practise their routines over and over again, so they can do them quickly in case of extreme cold and strong winds. They set up and take down their tent in a few minutes, and pack their sleds meticulously, the same way every time.
 The sleds, which they will pull with a harness around their waists, will each weigh around 60 kilos (132 pounds) at the start of their journey, carrying everything they need to survive.
 Their sleeping bags are designed to withstand temperatures as low as minus 60C (minus 76F), and they will mostly eat freeze-dried food during the expedition. A friend, top chef Armand Arnal, has also prepared a few sous vide (vacuum sealed) dishes for when they need a special pick-me-up.
 And to drink, they have as much snow to melt as they could ever need.

Durante los primeros quince días del año, el precio del kilo de tortilla presentó aumentos de hasta 16 por ciento anual en algunas entidades del país, de acuerdo con cifras del Sistema Nacional de Información e Integración de Mercados (SNIIM).


  Datos históricos en supermercados y tortillerías, los cuales fueron obtenidos por El Financiero mediante una solicitud de información a Profeco, señalan que el costo de la tortilla ha alcanzado en lo que va de enero de 2020 un promedio de 12.75 pesos por kilo de tortilla en la Ciudad de México


  Grupo Consultor de Mercados Agrícolas (GCMA) señaló que los incrementos durante el inicio del año se debieron a diversos factores, como la falta de competencia, ya que esto “genera ‘monopolios’ en algunos mercados regionales”.


  Otro rubro que jugó en contra del precio de la tortilla es el aumento de costos en insumos como el gas, gasolina, harina de maíz, así como otro tipo de materiales como papel y antiadherentes.


  El alza más considerable se observó en Coahuila con un alza de precios de 16.10 por ciento a tasa anual. Otras entidades donde el ‘taco con sal’ salió más costoso fueron Baja California (11.22 por ciento), Yucatán (11.03), Tamaulipas (10.15) y Guerrero (9.59).


  En la Ciudad de México se notó un alza anual de 9.9 por ciento, al pasar de un precio de 12.53 pesos por kilo de tortilla durante la primera quincena de enero de 2019, a 13.77 pesos para este año.


  En enero de 1999, muestran los datos, el precio promedio del kilo de tortilla en la capital fue 3.24 pesos.


  Esto significa que, desde esa fecha hasta la actualidad, las tortillas han aumentado su costo en 293 por ciento.

And that played its part in the early stages of Monday’s win at West Brom - a performance I don’t think we’d have seen from Stoke earlier in the season.
 Players are now understanding their roles off the ball and Michael O’Neill, having sifted through the players at his disposal, seems content with a squad which has the desire to carry out that hard work off the ball.
 It starts with Campbell and Nick Powell as the men up front at the start of the Albion game.
 They set the tone for pressing the opposition when they have possession in their own half, but once they are out of the game they can’t switch off.
 Powell has to be in a position to take the ball to feet if Stoke counter- attack along the ground and through the middle, while Campbell has to be in a position to take off for the ball over the top.
