Hey, Zach, it's Bob. So I think, traditionally our margins have been around 30% over the last 2 quarters. I think that's a good indicator of where we were historically. And, the drop was primarily due to the shutdown of the factory in Shenzhen. So, I think that you'd see, our margins going back to that general range, maybe a little bit lower, but the majority was the shutdown.

 The comment came after _Reuters_ exclusively reported on Thursday that a top FDA official said he would resign if the Trump administration approved a vaccine before it was shown to be safe and effective.
 “Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!” Mr. Trump wrote, tagging FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in the tweet.
 U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was a “dangerous statement” and that the president was “beyond the pale” for accusing the FDA of playing politics.
 The FDA could not immediately be reached for comment.
 Drug manufacturers in coordination with the FDA and National Institutes of Health are ramping up production while testing is underway in order to respond as soon as possible with a vaccine for COVID-19, which has killed nearly 800,000 people worldwide.
 Mr. Trump often uses Twitter to criticize federal agencies, sometimes accusing them of being controlled by the “deep state” in an apparent reference to long- serving staff who, in Mr. Trump’s eyes, are determined to undermine his agenda.
 His tweet increases the pressure on the FDA after Peter Marks, director of its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, last week said on a conference call with government officials, pharmaceutical executives and academics that he would resign if the agency rubber-stamped an unproven vaccine.
 Scientists, public health officials and lawmakers are worried that the Trump administration will push the FDA to approve a vaccine in advance of the vote, even if data from clinical trials do not support its widespread use.
 Mr. Marks, whose division regulates cutting-edge biotech treatments, vaccines and gene therapies, said he has not faced any political pressure and that the FDA would be guided by science alone. Should that change, he said on Thursday, “I would feel obligated (to resign) because in doing so, I would indicate to the American public that there’s something wrong.”

Based on the buzz they've already experienced on social media and the steady stream of customers they welcomed on opening night, they believe their restaurant is well positioned to bring home the bacon.
 "The two things people love are bacon and chocolate," Tanya said. "It makes people happy and we can't think of anything better."
 In addition to takeout orders, they'll also cater events.
 Initially, they planned to open an online business specializing in chocolate- covered bacon — their go-to recipe for living high on the hog. But they seized the opportunity when a storefront opened in February and gave the property an extensive renovation. They've since come up with a diverse menu of delicacies that all feature bacon as a common ingredient.
 They offer sweets such as bacon Kahlua fudge, salted caramel with bacon, chocolate-covered bacon bites, and bacon maple monkey bread. They have bacon sandwiches such as the bacon Joe. Kids should like macho bacon macaroni and cheese. They have a bacon nacho basket and snacks such as bacon swizzles and bacon jalapeno poppers. They have bacon pancakes and bacon croissants for breakfast, as well as bacon egg and cheese minis. There are several bacon meal deals.
 "As far as I can tell so far we did a lot of research and I don't know anybody who is anybody who is actually doing anything along these lines," Troy said. "We're very excited to be here in Pocatello and serve the public and give them something maybe they haven't experienced before."
 A local butcher shop, Del Monte Meats, is supplying them with a special cut of bacon that's especially long and thick — qualities needed for many of their menu items.
 They've lived in Pocatello for about 22 years and both hold other jobs. Tanya, the primary cook, is manager at Southwick Blackbelt Academy; Troy is the operations supervisor for a local company. But they both hope to eventually make a full-time career of running the restaurant. Their 21-year-old son Ely also plans to work with them.

Dustin Johnson continued his red hot play at Northern Trust Open on Saturday curling in a 40-foot eagle putt on 18 to give him a five shot cushion going into the final round of the FedExCup playoffs opener. Johnson's third round seven-under 64 while impressive was almost greeted with a yawn after the sensational 11-under 60 the big-hitting American carded on Friday that shot him to the top of the leaderboard where he has remained.Sitting five back are Harris English after returning a 66 for the second straight day and Scottie Scheffler, who returned a 67 a day after shooting a 59, just the 12th sub-60 round in PGA Tour history.It was another cool, confident display from Johnson at the TPC Boston piling up five birdies before dropping his first shot in two days with a bogey at the 13th.But Johnson would close in style with a birdie at 17 and an eagle at 18.It will mark the second time in as many tournaments Johnson has held the 54th lead but will be looking for a different result after failing to close the deal at the PGA Championships.Certainly Johnson will not be under as much pressure as he was at Harding Park where he started the final round with a one shot advantage, but he knows he cannot be complacent on layout where low scores are there for the taking."Obviously I'm in a great position and like where I'm at, but I'm still going to have to go out and shoot a good score," Johnson told reporters. "You can go low out here and guys are going low every day, especially with the conditions we have."This week's tournament, open to the top 125 golfers in the season-long points standings, is the first of three playoff events that culminate with the Sept. 4-7 Tour Championship in Atlanta and the $15 million prize to the FedExCup champion.Only the top 70 in the standings after this week go on to the BMW Championship at Olympia Fields outside Chicago, and from there the top 30 move on to Atlanta.There was no moving day charge from Tiger Woods, who plodded his way to a two-over 73.Woods got his day off to a positive start with a birdie at the second and ended on an upbeat note with another at 18 but in-between the 15-time major winner collected five bogeys to leave him just three strokes off the bottom of the leaderboard.It was an equally disappointing outing for Rory McIlroy, the Northern Irishman taking a pair of triple bogeys on his outward nine on way to a three-over 73.The defending FedEx Cup champion opened his round with a birdie but gave that back and more when his third shot at the second, a chip from just off the green, ricocheted off a rock into the water hazard on way to an eight.

It is believed the measure is connected to FATF demands and comes weeks before a further review of Pakistan’s efforts to vanquish terrorism and tighten the loopholes which allow it to be used by organizations involved in illegal activities. Pakistan is obviously keen to be removed from the grey list as soon as possible. It is also true that, while we have heard very little about major terrorist organizations in the country for some time, most of them have not disappeared. Jaish-e-Muhammad for example remains active in running seminaries and other institutions notably in southern Punjab, even though Masood Azhar himself is believed to be suffering serious sickness. The same is true of Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Haqqani Network which has always maintained a quiet front domestically.


  The detailed notification following UN Security Council advice issued by the Pakistan government is a reminder that we need to be watchful of terrorism and ensure there is no resurgence in areas where these groups are based. While it is true the military operation directed against them has badly weakened or virtually wiped out some groups, some elements that formed a part of these outfits remained free. It is also that they carry a grudge against the security apparatus which in many cases killed their brothers, fathers, sons or other relatives.


  This means Pakistan remains vulnerable to another terrorist upsurge at some point. It is essential that the many assets and accounts owned by these groups be shut down once and for all so that the money trail which leads to them can be followed and more obscure elements which aid terrorism discovered. We know that these exist. It is good to know that Pakistan is continuing its efforts to keep itself safe and reminding the world of its commitment to hunting down terrorism in all its forms and thereby avoiding the thousands of deaths it has suffered at the hands of militants in the past. This FATF grey listing should lead to a reckoning. We either need to spare no effort in disrupting terror networks or face the censure of the international community even more. The best Pakistan can do is to present evidence showing how vigilant it is in its banking transactions and counterterror strategy. We were previously blacklisted by the FATF from 2008-10 and greylisted from 2012-15. Pakistan has been the biggest victim of terrorism on the FATF table. This means that the stakes for failing to curb terrorism are the highest for Pakistan itself.

I first met Pandit Jasraj in 1993 when I got married and moved to Mumbai from Kolkata. Of course, I was familiar with his music, being a regular audience member at the famous Dover Lane Music Conference in Kolkata, four days of all-night performances of Indian classical music and dance now in its seventh decade. Every Indian musician worth his salt performed and my introduction to our rich musical heritage came from here, where I heard Panditji perform many times.So I was completely taken aback when I thought I saw him in the elevator in my building in Mumbai many moons ago, in his trademark attire, biting into a carrot! That image will always be etched in my mind. My husband, Om Puri, introduced us. I learnt he stayed in the same building. I was tickled. And what followed was an association less with Panditji personally and more with the family and the extended Pandit clan.Music and mastiPandit Jasraj belonged to the Mewati gharana, which was started by Ustad Ghagge Nazir Khan saab and from which his father, Pandit Motiram, and uncle, Pandit Jyotiram, continued the tradition. The former passed it on to his four sons, Maniram, Rajaram, Pratap and Jasraj. They are from Hissar in Haryana but moved to Kolkata (and the entire family including daughter Durga speak excellent Bengali). Incidentally, Pandit Motiram was also the state musician of the Nizam of Hyderabad.Panditji's wife, Madhura Jasraj, whom I call Chachiji (taking after his nephew and niece, Vinod and Sudarshana), is the daughter of the legendary filmmaker V Shantaram. Chachiji has been his strongest support in more than six long decades, looking after his whole brood of students like her own.Many students stayed with Pandit Jasraj for years without paying him a paisa. He believed in "vidya daan" or the charity of education.Vocalist, Ankita Joshi, his guru daughter who stayed with the family for 17 years (and who also tried to teach my son, albeit unsuccessfully), says, "Not once did Guruji or Gurumaa make us feel any different from Durgadi or Sharang Dev. Guruji was mastikhor and fun loving and played pranks as well as cricket with us." Yes, many a time I've seen Panditji and Durga play badminton in the compound. And he also loved to cook, his favourite being kada prasad, a type of sheera.Father figureHis brothers had long since passed on so Panditji was the father figure to their children (Jatin, Lalit, Sulakshana and Vijayeta) as well as Pandit Rattan Mohan Sharma (his sister Padmabai's son). When he visited his sister in her sasural in Rajasthan, he heard little Rattan sing. He brought him back with him to Mumbai and mentored him. Today, Rattan Mohan and his son, Swar Sharma, continue the tradition of the Mewati gharana along with a whole number of students who will take Panditji's legacy forward.The one quality I noticed about Panditji and which Ankita reiterates is, "He moved with the times and appreciated all forms of music, be it films or popular and encouraged it all." That can be seen in the music of his son, Sharang Dev and nephews, Jatin-Lalit, all ace Bollywood composers. This January, I met him for the last time during his 90th birthday celebrations in Juhu. He passed away in the US last week. He had gone there to perform and had been caught in the lockdown. At 90, he was tech-savvy and continued to perform online! At 90 he was a savvy Zoomer! And that says a lot.Many students stayed with him for years without paying him a paisa. Pandit Jasraj believed in "vidya daan" (the charity of education) and Chachiji supported him in this endeavour. Stoic in her grief, all she said was, "Meri zindagi ka sahara chala gaya, Nanditaji (I have lost my life support, Nandita)."Panditji has passed on. But his music is still alive. And his legacy will be carried forward.Nandita Puri is an author, chairperson of the Om Puri Foundation and wife of the late actor Om PuriFrom HT Brunch, August 23, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch

Some Liberian lawmakers were particularly insulted by the layoff plan because it initially was to take effect on Liberia’s Independence Day, on July 26. The country began as a settlement for freed slaves from the United States in 1822, but declared itself an independent nation 25 years later. The layoffs have not yet occurred as company officials do the necessary paperwork with the Liberian Ministry of Labor to reduce its workforce.

  # Pacers coach Nate McMillan: 'I didn't think we fought in that first half'


  Ethan Sears


  Indianapolis Star


  View Comments


  About 90 minutes before Game 3 of the Pacers' series against the Heat, coach Nate McMillan was in front of the media, talking about how his team needed to improve on defense. Take away the airspace that let Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro and Co. run rampant over the first two games. Defend without fouling. Do it for 48 minutes.


  Forty-eight minutes, 52 Heat free throws, 11 first-half 3-pointers and a demoralizing 124-115 loss later, there was McMillan again. Frustrated that the Pacers had done none of those things.


  “You saw it. That’s what was happening in that first half," McMillan said. "The game plan was to get to their chest, run them off the 3-point line. There were a couple times where we closed out, hands were down. And we gave up 11 3s in the first half.


  "The keys to this game was to take their airspace away and keep them off the free throw line and we didn’t do that in this game.”


  That let the Heat build up an 18-point halftime lead after 24 minutes that featured a barrage of open looks from beyond the arc for Miami. At one point, after a failure to close out on Herro, McMillan got hit with a technical foul.


  Though the Pacers turned things around in the second half, making the game close, it wasn't enough. And, now down 3-0 in the series, it could cost them the season.


  "I think in the second half, we just played harder," Victor Oladipo said.


  "Just not playing hard enough, not executing," Malcolm Brogdon said about the defense in the first half.


  McMillan was more direct.


  "I didn’t think we fought in that first half," McMillan said.


  He was happier with the second half, talking about "scrap" and "fight." It might have been the best 24 minutes the Pacers played all series. But that's not much of a consolation prize facing a 3-0 deficit against a team that's had the better of them for nearly all of this series.


  Indiana has yet to put together 48 minutes of solid defense in this series, letting the Heat beat them with different personnel each game. On Saturday, it was Herro and Goran Dragic combining for eight 3-pointers while Butler got to the line 20 times.


  "It’s a lot easier said than done," Oladipo said. "I said, you can look plain and simple, but it’s not as easy as it looks. Just gotta run through the problem instead of making excuses."


  Miami set a franchise record with 74 first-half points. Oladipo asked whether their 52 free throws were a record, too. It was nearly double the Pacers' 28, and both Oladipo and Malcolm Brogdon played the fourth quarter with five fouls.


  “I can’t explain that," McMillan said. Then he repeated himself. "I can’t explain that. FIfty-two free throws is ridiculous. They had 24 at the half, (Jimmy) Butler shoots 20 of them (in the game). This is the playoffs. I thought some of those calls were, I just, I can’t explain it.”


  Brogdon had some optimism, relatively speaking.


  "We definitely figured something out today in that second half," he said.


  But after three games and three losses, that might be too little, too late.

Dustin Johnson continued his red hot play at Northern Trust Open on Saturday curling in a 40-foot eagle putt on 18 to give him a five shot cushion going into the final round of the FedExCup playoffs opener. Johnson's third round seven-under 64 while impressive was almost greeted with a yawn after the sensational 11-under 60 the big-hitting American carded on Friday that shot him to the top of the leaderboard where he has remained.
 Sitting five back are Harris English after returning a 66 for the second straight day and Scottie Scheffler, who returned a 67 a day after shooting a 59, just the 12th sub-60 round in PGA Tour history.
 It was another cool, confident display from Johnson at the TPC Boston piling up five birdies before dropping his first shot in two days with a bogey at the 13th.
 But Johnson would close in style with a birdie at 17 and an eagle at 18.
   
   
 It will mark the second time in as many tournaments Johnson has held the 54th lead but will be looking for a different result after failing to close the deal at the PGA Championships.
 Certainly Johnson will not be under as much pressure as he was at Harding Park where he started the final round with a one shot advantage, but he knows he cannot be complacent on layout where low scores are there for the taking.
 "Obviously I'm in a great position and like where I'm at, but I'm still going to have to go out and shoot a good score," Johnson told reporters. "You can go low out here and guys are going low every day, especially with the conditions we have."
 This week's tournament, open to the top 125 golfers in the season-long points standings, is the first of three playoff events that culminate with the Sept. 4-7 Tour Championship in Atlanta and the $15 million prize to the FedExCup champion.
 Only the top 70 in the standings after this week go on to the BMW Championship at Olympia Fields outside Chicago, and from there the top 30 move on to Atlanta.
 There was no moving day charge from Tiger Woods, who plodded his way to a two- over 73.
 Woods got his day off to a positive start with a birdie at the second and ended on an upbeat note with another at 18 but in-between the 15-time major winner collected five bogeys to leave him just three strokes off the bottom of the leaderboard.
 It was an equally disappointing outing for Rory McIlroy, the Northern Irishman taking a pair of triple bogeys on his outward nine on way to a three-over 73.
 The defending FedEx Cup champion opened his round with a birdie but gave that back and more when his third shot at the second, a chip from just off the green, ricocheted off a rock into the water hazard on way to an eight.

New cases of COVID-19 in Australia’s Victoria state continued to decline Saturday with 182 new infections, along with 13 deaths. It was the second day in a row in which the number of new infections has fallen below 200. Only 24 of the latest cases are without a known source, a contrast to the start of August when hundreds could not be traced. Australia’s second largest city, Melbourne, and parts of rural Victoria were placed in full lockdown in early August. It's due to continue until Sept. 13. “Whilst tomorrow’s numbers will be for tomorrow, we are all pleased to see a ‘one’ in front of these additional case numbers, and to a certain extent, it is perhaps at that level a little quicker than I thought it might be,” Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. Meanwhile, an outbreak linked to a youth detention center in Queensland state has caused the state’s premier to reintroduce restrictions on public gatherings. The cluster connected to the Brisbane Youth Detention Center now stands at seven, including six confirmed on Saturday. The 127 inmates, some as young as 13, have been locked in their rooms since a 77-year-old female supervisor tested positive on Wednesday. The worker, who is now in a hospital, worked five shifts at the center while infectious. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told a news conference Saturday the cases are of concern because “people have been out and about in the community.”

Candidates for Virginia’s 1st District House seat disagreed over whether police reform decisions should be made nationally or locally and on the legal concept of qualified immunity that protects officers from most lawsuits.
 Incumbent 1st District Rep. Rob Wittman and challenger Qasim Rashid squared off Thursday night in the Criminal Justice Forum and Debate, held at the Rappahannock Regional Criminal Justice Academy in Spotsylvania County, the first time the two candidates have met face to face for a debate since Rashid won the Democratic Party nomination for the congressional seat.
 The 1st District includes Hanover and New Kent counties in the Richmond area and also covers the city of Fredericksburg, Stafford and Caroline counties, the Middle Peninsula, the Northern Neck and parts of Spotsylvania and Prince William counties. It has been represented by Wittman, a Republican, since 2008.

ON the face of it, the PPP-led Sindh government’s move on Thursday to carve a seventh district out of Karachi seems like a harmless administrative decision. But scratch the surface and listen to the opposition’s clamour and one realises that something deeper, more sinister is afoot. The provincial cabinet has sought to create Keamari district, as well as more potential new districts in Sindh, “for the convenience of local people”, as the chief minister put it. If this really leads to better governance and service delivery, then there should be nothing to worry about. However, if these moves — specifically administrative changes in Karachi — are designed to ‘improve’ the chances of the PPP grabbing a few more seats in the metropolis, especially when local government elections are due, then such political ploys can only be condemned as gerrymandering. At this point, all evidence points to the fact that the PPP has performed an administrative sleight of hand by creating Keamari district.

Every time I tried to move up and get some air on my car, he would just slide up in front of me like an idiot. He’s the reason we lost the lead, but at the end we just weren’t good enough. I thought the 11 (Denny Hamlin) was better than us all day long. We got the lead there in the pits and was able to use clean air to our advantage. I was never happy with the car all day long. The SiriusXM Camry was fast, but the balance was all over the place. It was firing off tight and getting loose on long runs. At the end, just nothing I could do. It was out of control, sideways.”

Those _Fall Guys_ rumours were true – the world's favourite jumping jellybeans have partnered with Valve to introduce new Portal-flavoured costumes to the game, the first being Portal 2's P-Body.
 As is typically the case with Fall Guys skins, the top and bottom halves are available separately, and you'll need 5 crowns to grab the top and another 5 to secure the bottom. That means you'll need to have earned 10 – 10! – crowns to sport the complete package… something I can only dream of, it seems (and there's no way for me to cheat, either, as crowns cannot be bought with IRL money!).
 The skin is available for both PC and PS4 players (thanks, _PC Gamer_).
 Last week rumours swirled that a Portal-flavoured crossover was coming, but the dataminer concerned shared images of a Chell-inspired costume, not P-Body. There are also reports of a My Friend Pedro crossover on the cards, too, so watch this space.
 The recipient of the coveted Fall Guys "Fallen One" costume has been revealed, and it's streaming extraordinaire DrLupo. _Mediatronic recently revealed_ that it had dropped a special costume into the inventory of the "statistically best" Fall Guys player. In a video shared by DrLupo on Friday, you can see the streamer discovering the costume in his inventory, with the prolific Fall Guys Twitter account responding in its trademark manner.
  _Fall Guys is publisher Devolver Digital's biggest ever launch_. Prior to Fall Guys, Devolver's previously biggest game by player count on Steam was SCUM, which clocked up a little shy of 68,000 players when it launched in 2018.
 In spite of the _server issues that marred its launch_, it's also making huge waves on Steam and remains the biggest game on _Twitch by viewer count_, second only to the generic all-encompassing category, "Just Chatting". This means that right now, there are more people watching Fall Guys on Twitch than any other game in the world, including _Fortnite_, _GTA V_, and League of Legends.
  _Make sure you check out our_ _ _Fall Guys tips__ _before the next time you head into the game._

It’s a new season with a new coach and a new start for the Browns, and, although everything is still fresh, for the players who were part of last year it is wise to remember why it was a disaster.
 “Everybody put out those high expectations just because of how good we looked on paper,” defensive end Olivier Vernon, in his ninth NFL season and second with the Browns, said on a recent Zoom conference. “I feel like me coming in, it was a very young team across the board, and me being in this league for a little while, nothing is ever going to be given to you. You have to earn, scratch and claw to get a win.
 “We write our own script now for this year. I think last year was a lesson to a lot of the guys, especially when you know how long the season is and the type of competition we have in our division.”
