Attorney General Mike Hunter and Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater — two prosecutors who could decide the fate of charges against Epic Charter Schools — say the slow-moving pace of the investigation is unrelated to personal ties or political campaign contributions.
 Hunter has been one of the top recipients of political campaign donations by Epic’s founders and other school backers. And Prater is married to a top executive at one of Epic’s sponsors.
 Six months have passed since the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation last filed public records in court revealing they were executing search warrants. And eight months have passed since Gov. Kevin Stitt requested an investigative audit of Epic and its related entities by State Auditor Cindy Byrd.

The bond market sounded the alarm on the effects of the virus long before the stock market, and yields fell further Friday.
 The Fed surprised the market earlier this week by cutting interest rates half a percentage point. Investors expect other central banks around the world to follow suit in hopes of supporting markets.
 At the same time, doubts are high about how much effect lower rates can have. Cheaper loans may encourage people and business to make big purchases, but they can’t get workers back into factories if they’re out on quarantine.
 A boost for stocks came earlier this week after Congress agreed on an $8.3 billion bill to combat the coronavirus, which President Donald Trump signed Friday. But investors say a slowdown in the economy seems inevitable, and many analysts expect the market’s sharp swings to continue as long as the number of new cases accelerates.
 “As the market tries to find its bottom, it’s going to go up and down, up and down, until it has a reason to steadily change in one direction or the other,” said Taback of Wells Fargo Private Bank.

 NARRAGANSETT – The town will pilot test a new, free meal program for seniors at its community center on Mumford Road three days a week. On Monday, the town council unanimously approved a one-year contract with Blackstone Health, Inc. (BHI) for congregate dining services at the center on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. According to Narragansett Parks and Recreation Director Steve Wright, the new service is expected to begin in a few months.
 “Karen [Flint, Narragansett Community Center Program Coordinator] and one of our assistants at the community center are ready to start,” he said, “but we also need volunteers. We already had an outreach program. We’re excited about this. We think it’s good for the community. And obviously, the folks that are signed up are excited about this. And this is a pilot program, so if it works, we’re hoping to move it to five days a week somewhere down the road.”
 According to Wright, BHI will prepare and deliver both hot and cold meals to the community center on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays for patrons over the age of 60. While attendance to the program is free, a $3 donation is suggested, though not required. Wright describes the arrangement as “stress free” and said anyone who did not or could not afford the donation could still participate. The parks and recreation director also said about 70 members of the community had already signed up for the program and about 30 had agreed to volunteer. Volunteers for the program, who Wright said would work on a rotating basis, would help serve the meals and clean up afterward. The town will work with the Rhode Island Department of Health to facilitate the new offering.
 Wright said after renovation work was completed at the community center, an opportunity opened up to begin the program.
 “We have a beautiful facility, as you all know,” he said to the town council. “We just renovated that facility. We’re excited to show it off. We’re looking for your approval tonight to get this started.”
 The new service is expected to begin in “a month or two,” according to Wright. Flint is currently undergoing food safety certification, and RIDOH must approve the program’s equipment and facility.
 “We don’t know when the official start date is yet,” said Wright. “Karen is taking a food service course, and once that’s done and we get the health department in to approve our kitchen, and get BHI on, we’re hoping to get started in a month or two and we’ll make that announcement. It’s been a bit of a process.”
 BHI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Pawtucket. Equipment needed for the program, such as refrigerators, dishwashers and utensils, will be provided by BHI.
 Those interested in volunteering for the program can sign up at the Narragansett Community Center at 53 Mumford Road by speaking with Flint and filling out brief paperwork.
 “This is very important to Steve and I and also to the community,” she said. “Steve and I have discussed it and we feel this is a good thing for the town, and members of the community will also benefit.”

She's kidding. But only a little. A busy summer that included competing three times in less than a month — a massive workload at the sport's top level — had left her drained. Yet during the selection camp she had recovered, which made missing the cut only more difficult.
 “I was coming back into peak shape and for that to just kind of go down the drain and not used was really heartbreaking for me," Hurd said.
 The 2017 world champion briefly shut down in the aftermath. Her seemingly boundless energy vanished. She wasn't injured. She was devastated, the symptoms manifesting themselves when she returned to training.
 “My whole body just kind of felt like fatigued and it just didn't want to do anything,” she said. “Like my whole body just felt lethargic and heavy and it was so hard to just like do basic things.”
 Not so much anymore. Hurd pulled herself out of the funk by Thanksgiving, pushed by the upgrades coach Slava Glazounov challenged her to incorporate into her routines, routines she's eager to show off in Milwaukee on Saturday at the American Cup. The invitational is the first high-profile event leading to the 2020 Olympics, a chance for Hurd to regain some of the swagger she lost during the hectic summer of 2019.
 Looking back, Hurd has no regrets. The opportunity to compete at the Pan American Games in Peru — which happened between the U.S. Classic in late July and the U.S. Championships in mid-August — was too good to pass up.
 “The experience was one that comes around once every four years,” Hurd said. “I had so much fun even though honestly I didn't do my greatest, I wish I did better but the whole experience as a whole was great for me."
 Hurd helped the Americans win a team gold medal but she didn't compete in an any of the event finals thanks to international rules that only allow the top two qualifiers from a country to advance. Things didn't go much better at the US Championships a week later. A miscue on floor during the first day dropped her well off the pace in the all-around, though she did recover to finish fourth, earning a silver on uneven bars in the process.
 It was good. Just not quite good enough for Hurd, a perfectionist who admits she's never quite satisfied even if she's one of only two active women's gymnasts on the planet not named Simone Biles with a world all-around gold medal in her trophy case.

Fellow Loons midfielder Kevin Molino took it a step further Tuesday, saying he never quite felt like his old self throughout last year.
 Despite them playing a combined 50 games last season, these two perspectives show full mental and physical recovery from torn anterior cruciate ligaments can take much longer than the standard recovery estimate of 8 to 12 months.
 Molino tore his ACL and menisci in March 2018, while Finlay injured his ACL a month later. Both missed the rest of that season before slowly working their back in 2019.
 In the 2020 season opener Sunday, both Finlay and Molino produced at high levels in the Loons’ 3-1 road victory over the Portland Timbers. Molino scored two goals, while Finlay was a playmaker on all three goals and was credited with two assists, including Luis Amarilla’s winner in the 76th minute.

Twenty-one people aboard a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco have tested positive for coronavirus, US officials said on Friday, as the fast-spreading respiratory disease was reported in half a dozen new US states.
 Vice President Mike Pence, who is running the US response to the outbreak, said at a news conference that 19 crew members and two passengers out of 46 people tested so far on the Grand Princess ocean liner had the virus.
 The vessel, with about 3,400 passengers and crew, would be taken to a non- commercial port where everyone on board would be tested, he said.
 The infections aboard the _Grand Princess_ added to the more than 100,000 cases across the world, as the coronavirus outbreak reached more countries and economic damage intensified, with business districts starting to empty and stock markets tumbling.
 President Donald Trump on Friday signed a bill to provide $8.3 billion to bolster the capacity to test for coronavirus and fund other measures in the United States. Cases have now been reported in half of the 50 US states. Fifteen people have died in the country, out of more than 250 cases.
 In many affected countries, people were being asked to stay home from work, schools were closed, large gatherings and sports and music events were canceled, stores were cleared of staples like toiletries and water, and face masks became a common sight.
 The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations, with seven countries reporting their first cases on Friday.
 Mainland China, where the outbreak started, has seen more than 3,000 deaths, but the epidemic is now spreading faster elsewhere.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) said every country should make containing the epidemic its top priority, pointing to Iran's national action plan to combat one of the worst outbreaks after a slow start.
 Iran's death toll from the virus jumped to 124, as more than 1,000 new cases were diagnosed over 24 hours.
 The Vatican reported its first case, a patient in its health services, worsening the prospects of the virus having already spread further in the Italian capital, since most employees in the walled city-state live in Rome, and those who live in the Vatican frequently go in and out to the city that surrounds it.
 Italy is the worst-hit European country, with a death toll as of Friday of 197.
 About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, the WHO said this week.
 SUPPLY CHAINS BROKEN
 Moves by some major economies, including the United States, to cut interest rates and pledge funds to fight the epidemic have done little to allay fears about the spread of the disease and the economic fallout. Supply chains have been crippled around the world, especially in China, the world's second largest economy, where the outbreak began.

 Bank of America Corp is splitting its trading force from Monday and sending 100 New York-based staff to nearby Stamford, Connecticut, sources familiar with the matter said.
 In London, Europe's financial capital, the Canary Wharf district was unusually quiet. S&P Global's large office stood empty after the company sent its 1,200 staff home, and HSBC asked around 100 people to work from home after a worker tested positive for the illness.
 France's prime minister said nurseries and schools would close for 15 days from Monday in the two areas worst hit by coronavirus infections, one north of Paris and the other in the northeastern part of the country.
 The South by Southwest music and tech festival in Austin, Texas, and two music festivals in Florida were canceled over concerns about events that bring crowds of people into close proximity. The NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament was scheduled to go ahead at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore this weekend, but without spectators.
 Saudi Arabia will suspend public attendance at all sports events starting Saturday, the ministry of sports said.
 The United Nations said it had canceled some meetings in Bonn, Germany, and elsewhere planned in the run-up to a crucial U.N. climate summit to be held in Scotland in November.

Woods has been saying all year that he plans to play fewer events, mainly so the 44-year-old with five knee surgeries and four back surgeries can stay in golf longer.
 He is a two-time winner on the TPC Sawgrass, most recently in 2013. Woods had the first of four back operatons the following year and was at The Players only once over the next four years, a tie for 69th in 2015. He ended that season with two more back surgeries.
 Before that, Woods missed The Players in 2008 when it was held in May. He had arthroscopic knee surgery after the Masters that year and didn't play again until the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, which he won despite shredded ligaments in his left knee and a double stress fracture in his leg.
 That limits the amount of golf Woods will play leading into his title defense at the Masters, one of the biggest moments in sports a year ago when he rallied to win a fifth green jacket and his first major in 11 years.
 Next on the schedule after The Players is the Valspar Championship at Innisbrook, where Woods tied for second two years ago. It was his first appearance at the Tampa Bay event, and it attracted record crowds.
 After that is the Dell Match Play in Austin, Texas, where last year Woods reached the quarterfinals. It turned out to be a pivotal week in his preparations for the Masters. That's followed by the Valero Open in San Antonio, although Woods has never played the week before the Masters.

What you don't see will also matter.

It's blocking all ads trying to exploit the outbreak while helping the WHO and governments run useful ads. YouTube is pulling videos that push bogus prevention claims instead of telling people to seek medical help. The Play Store already has policies barring both exploitative apps and those with "misleading or potentially harmful" health info.
 Even the DeepMind team is getting involved. It use the latest version of its AlphaFold AI system to produce structure predictions for proteins linked to SARS-CoV-2 in a bid to help understand the virus and develop treatments. The predictions haven't been verified through experiments, but Google is betting that the faster release could make a meaningful impact.

¡Habló la mejor amiga! La modelo Olinda Castañeda se pronunció sobre el posible romance entre Shirley Arica y el futbolista de Alianza Lima, Jean Deza. Y es que recordemos que la parejita ha sido ampayada en más de dos ocasiones por las cámaras de “Magaly TV, la firme”. Frente a las imágenes emitidas, le popular ‘Chica realidad’ estuvo junto a Magaly Medina y reveló que tuvo una relación sentimental con Deza hace muchos años, incluso antes de haber estado con Reimond Manco. Asimismo, Arica señaló que recién hace pocos meses han vuelto a tener comunicación, ya que anteriormente la modelo estaba de pareja con el padre de su menor hija, Rodney Pio Dean. “Espero que sea un chico caballero, bueno, atento, que es lo que estoy viendo. Yo a mi amiga la veo feliz y si la relación funciona o se da en algún momento, ellos son los indicados para decirlo, yo la veo tranquila”, precisó Castañeda. Por otro lado, Olinda fue consultada por las distintas denuncias por agresión que tiene Jean Deza impuestas por diferentes parejas sentimentales. “Todos cometemos errores, ha vivido momentos difíciles, es un chico joven, sin mamá porque la perdió. Luego, tuvo todo ese poder, esa economía a veces aloca a ciertas personas que no están preparadas para eso. Espero que haya aprendido la lección”, concluyó diciendo.

If you imagine any real-world relationship where a dozen women plot against each other to compete for one man’s affection, and the man faces the insurmountable pressure to literally compare all of the women and pick the best one to marry, you likely don’t feel as convinced by the premise leading to a happy relationship. There’s immense value in just simply being entertained, and these shows serve that purpose well. But anything outside of that, and they just fall short. Falling in love in real life shouldn’t involve proving your worth, ever, and it certainly, will look less glamorous — plus, will likely involve a lot more unflattering angles.

Woodbrook says hurrah!? The Carnival is over but the stink, paint stains on property walls and the mental reminder of the booming music trucks which caused windows and doors to rattle and vibrate along with your very body if you were brave enough to venture into the open to see the passing bands, all remain.
 The joy that is Carnival has not been the experience of the residents of Woodbrook in the recent past as the agony lasts long after the event. What then is the future of residential Woodbrook as it is faced with life alongside Carnival fetes and the parade of the bands? To add insult to injury, the disturbances from other events continue all year round.
 Carnival 2020 proved to be no better than the previous ones for Woodbrook residents. The Woodbrook Residents Association headed by Ms Dolly attended an NCC meeting before Carnival at which attendees included the Mayor of Port of Spain along with other special interest representatives. The discussions on Woodbrook addressed vending on the sidewalks of Ariapita Avenue (as permitted by the City Corporation), Jouvert band routes away from residential side streets (to avoid property damage—paint on perimeter walls) and the Socadrome (reduction of music volume on residential streets).

Just one episode into season 12, _RuPaul's Drag Race_ is facing some controversy.
 Contestant Sherry Pie, real name Joey Gugliemelli, has been disqualified from the competition after multiple catfishing claims, which he then admitted to and apologized for in a statement of his own. Sherry Pie will make her debut in tonight's episode.
 "In light of recent developments and Sherry Pie's statement, Sherry Pie has been disqualified from _RuPaul's Drag Race,"_ said a spokesperson for VH1 and World of Wonder. "Out of respect for the hard work of the other queens, VH1 will air the season as planned. Sherry will not appear in the grand finale scheduled to be filmed later this spring."
 Guglimelli was accused of posing as a casting director who led actors over email to submit audition tapes of themselves doing "degrading" things. One actor detailed his experiences with Gugliemelli in a Facebook post, explaining how they became friends in college at State University of New York College at Cortland. Another friend then told him about a play that was casting, and referred him to casting director Allison Mossey, who was actually Gugliemelli.

"The appearance is unfortunate to have an investigation going on that involves a person in an active campaign for president," said Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the only Republican to vote to convict Trump in the Senate impeachment trial. "It would be my preference to have a nonpolitical body evaluating whether an investigation is merited and carrying it out."
 Romney's a member of the Homeland Security Committee, where Chairman Ron Johnson plans to hold a vote on subpoenaing records of a U.S.-based consulting firm that represented Burisma when Hunter Biden was a well-paid member of Burisma's board and his father oversaw U.S. policy on Ukraine.
 Johnson and Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley have been investigating the Bidens for potential conflicts of interest involving Ukraine and China, where Hunter Biden also did business. Shortly after Trump was acquitted by the Senate on impeachment charges last month, the chairmen said they were seeking records of Hunter Biden's travel.
 The GOP-led investigations have taken on new prominence since Tuesday's round of primaries in the Democratic presidential nomination race that vaulted Biden back into the front-runner spot after his campaign stumbled through the first three contests.
 Trump is eager to turn the tables on Democrats, who impeached him on charges he abused his office by asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate whether Biden put pressure on Ukraine to help Burisma. Now the president is planning to use the questions being raised in the investigations as part of his re-election effort.
 "That will be a major issue in the campaign. I will bring that up all the time, because I don't see any way out," Trump said Wednesday in an interview on Fox News. "I don't believe they'll be able to answer those questions. That was purely corrupt."
 Johnson denies the probe is politically motivated. He defends his investigation into possible conflicts of interest by the former vice president as part of the oversight responsibility of Congress. He said he hopes to issue an interim report on the Bidens and Burisma in the next month or two, when the Democratic primaries should be winding down.
 "Joe Biden has never satisfactorily answered these questions," Johnson told reporters. "If I were a Democratic primary voter I would want answers to these questions."
 Other Republicans said they want to put the Ukraine story and the impeachment drama behind them.

2\. It’s a relief, then, that _Onward_ does ultimately right itself and, against all odds, still provide a signature Pixar moment or two, even improbably jerking a few tears here or there. That speaks to an almost pathological ability to find the beating heart of any story, even if, as is the case here, it’s surrounded by a lot of “irreverent” bells and whistles that feel less organic than “desperately clung to” as if to remind us, “Look, look, still Pixar!” But it also is a result of what appears, at least in its initial stages, to be a deeply personal project for director and co-writer Dan Scanlon. Scanlon is a Pixar lifer, and thus a project of this magnitude feels like the result of a lifetime of hard work and dedication. But it also feels like the result of someone who has learned long ago the compromises you have to make. That Pixar has become more about the compromises rather than the passion of the thing sums up exactly why _Onward_ , for all its virtues, is reason to worry.
