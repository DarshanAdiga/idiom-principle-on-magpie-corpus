When Bale was young, he never really went out in Cardiff.
 “I always focused on my football and I didn't drink so I never went out too much,” he says.
 “That’s why I think by having these businesses, like Par 59, you can still socialise with people that like to go out. It brings everyone together and gives everyone the option to have fun on a night out rather than going out and getting plastered.
 “That’s what we are trying, to bring everyone together whether you like to drink or not or whether you you like to just play golf.”
 A number of ventures are combining pubs with social sports and they have seen rapid growth in recent years.
 Bounce, which centres on ping pong, recently raised $20m at the end of 2019 to expand in the UK and US, while Flight Club, focused on darts, expanded to the US with two venues, and has four sites in the UK. Puttshack, a mini-golf bar, has four venues in London and the south-east, with a Miami venture in the pipeline.

People who are hospitalized within 14 days of an election but want to vote can get ballots through a process spelled out in state law.
 The Illinois primary is March 17.
 Under the law, any qualified voter who has been admitted to a hospital, nursing home or rehabilitation center due to an illness or injury not more than 14 days before an election can have a ballot delivered to them by a relative or a registered voter from their home precinct. In order to get the ballot, they must fill out an application and also have a certificate concerning the reason they can't vote in person from a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or physician assistant.
 The relative or same-precinct registered voter needs to take the paperwork to the election office -- which in Peoria County is the Peoria County Election Commission, 4422 N. Brandywine Dr.; is the county clerk's office in Tazewell County, in the McKenzie Building at 11 S. 4th St., Suite 203; and is the county clerk's office in Woodford County, at the courthouse, 115 N. Main St., Suite 202. There, the paperwork is checked and notarized, and the vote-by-mail ballot can then be hand-delivered to the voter. The filled-out ballot must be returned to the election office by 7 p.m. on Election Day.
 Information on the process is provided to managers on each unit at OSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center so they can make it available to patients, a spokeswoman there said.
 Voters may also apply online or over the phone to receive a vote-by-mail ballot through noon on Thursday. It must be postmarked by Election Day to be counted.

“Games never come down to just one play,” said Panther coach Wade Fyock. “We had some opportunities that we missed, but still had a chance at the end. It’s a tough way to go down, but that’s the beauty of high school basketball, the emotions can turn by the second.”
 Braden Adams and Fyock each led the Panthers with 19 points, while Koleszarik contributed 11.
 The contest was a see-saw battle, with each team making runs throughout the game. After a deadlocked opening quarter, the Huskies scored seven straight to go up 17-10 on Hamid Rodkey’s three-point play. After Fyock’s 3-pointer pulled the Panthers within 19-18, Burk’s layup capped off another 7-0 Huskies run before Fyock’s buzzer-beating 3 closed out the half to cut the Panther deficit to 26-21.
 Shade then caught fire from long range in the third quarter. The Panthers buried six 3-pointers in the period, with Koleszarik hitting two from beyond the arc during a 14-2 surge that regained a 35-28 lead for Shade.
 The Huskies subsequently battled back to within 43-40 with just seconds left on Bobroski’s 3-pointer, but Koleszarik drained a long bomb at the buzzer to put his team up by six heading into the fourth.
 A 3-pointer by Adams gave the Panthers their largest lead of the final quarter at 49-42 less than a minute in, but the Huskies defense then held Shade without a bucket for nearly six minutes. That allowed Bishop Carroll to eventually tie the game at 49 on a Bobroski 3-point play followed by two Burk free throws at the 4:44 mark.
 Shade subsequently took its last lead at 51-49 with 58 seconds left after Fyock’s layup on a nice feed from Koleszarik, and the Huskies then missed a potential tying shot with 15 seconds remaining that was rebounded by Adams, setting the stage for the frantic finish.

A substantial increase in HD antenna models and the expansion of streaming services such as Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Video, is augmenting broadcast TV at a fraction of the price of a cable or satellite subscription. Furthermore, many technology vendors have partnered with OTARD providers to offer services to end-users without any interruption. Moreover, end-users are emphasizing on better reception of services which involves the deployment of advance antennas. In addition, growing adoption of IoT has led to the incorporation of connected solutions in various sectors, which is creating the need for improved communications that require antennas. Thus, increasing focus of providers to offer highly high definition services and adoption of over the top (OTT) content is anticipated to drive the over the air reception devices market during the forecast period.

 As Missouri prepared for statehood, a constitution had to be written and a place selected for its capital. The process began June 12, 1820, with a convention in St. Louis. It was decided the seat of government stay in St. Louis until October 1826 and then move to a point on the Missouri river within forty miles of the Osage river.
 Five Commissioners were appointed to select a location that complied with that resolution.
 However, agreeing on a location for a temporary seat of government was easier said than done. On October 6, Mr. Ledue of St. Louis, suggested St. Louis. It didn't pass. Other suggestions followed over the next few days. St. Charles, Franklin, and Florissant were named as possible locations, but they, too, were voted down. Mr. Rogers of Cooper County proposed Boonville, but it failed to carry by a vote of 13 to 22. Other suggestions included Ste. Genevieve and Herculaneum. Finally, after 84 days, the session was adjourned and St. Charles was agreed upon.
 A notice was issued by the governor April 20, 1821, calling for the Legislature to assemble June 4 to pass an act \"Providing for the Location of the Permanent Seat of Government.\" Again, much time was taken to decide where the capital would be. It was finally narrowed down to Cote Sans Dessein and Howard's Bluff. Howard's Bluff was chosen and the City of Jefferson was laid out.
 Now that the location was decided, the next legal steps began that would sell certain lots for the funds to construct the building. The contract for building the capitol went to Daniel Colgan Jr. for $24,739.
 The state legislature met in St. Charles from June 1821 to December 1826. After that, it met in Jefferson City.

The Blount Partnership is trying to get ahead of what a coronavirus outbreak in the county could do to businesses by hosting a panel of experts Friday.
 Set for the morning of March 13, the panel will include a number of local business representatives and some health department officials to address how small and large Blount businesses can adapt if the infamous COVID-19 comes to the county.
 Partnership Communications Director Jeff Muir confirmed the event was something that came to fruition just after the first coronavirus case was announced in Tennessee on Friday.
 “We just wanted to make sure that our chamber businesses and businesses throughout the county ... had an opportunity to hear what the different ramifications are when facing this virus,” he said.
 The two-hour discussion will address what business managers can do to stay afloat if sickness keep their employees away from work.
 Muir said part of the discussion also will tackle employment law: what to do if an employee contracts the virus and what the laws regarding a work-from- home policy look like.
 Panelists will include Becky Huckaby with McGhee Tyson Airport; Howard Jackson with Wimberly, Lawson, Wright, Daves & Jones; Bob Booker of DENSO; a Clayton Homes representative; Kelly Fletcher from Fletcher Marketing PR; and two representatives from the Blount County Health Department, Annie Baker and Will Gates.
 Topics that panelists will discuss include how an outbreak could impact businesses and advice about preparing.
 There will be question-and-answer time and much of the two hours will be dedicated to effective communication efforts moving forward.
 “Tuesday of last week we weren’t even discussing it,” Muir said. “As the week went on we said ‘We probably need to do something because this seems to be moving awfully quickly.’ And who knows where we’ll be next Tuesday.”
 Universities across the state already are planning for remote classrooms, Muir pointed out, and businesses may have to follow suit.
 The event will be streamed on Facebook at the Partnership’s page. Muir said he expects it to pack a room with a capacity of 80.
 “There are a lot more questions than answers right now,” Muir said, noting the wisdom panelists have to offer is precautionary. “Hopefully we don’t have to take a whole lot of this into action, but we especially want the business community to be prepared. If people stay home, this could have far-reaching impact.”

Dr. Sandra Vannoy, an Ashe County native who grew up on a farm in Todd beside the New River, was recently named acting dean of the Walker College of Business at Appalachian State University in February, the university announced.
 From those roots, Vannoy said she experienced a traditional upbringing by Depression-era parents who strongly believed in hard work and the power of education. Her father, William, is 94 and served as the pastor at Pilot Mountain Baptist Church for many years. Her late mother, Nancy, was a homemaker, while her brother, John, lives in Mooresville, and her sister, Debbie, lives in Todd. Her husband, Jim Todd, is retired from the financial services and manufacturing fields.
 Vannoy graduated from Beaver Creek High School in West Jefferson and holds an undergraduate degree in finance and a master’s degree in business administration from Appalachian State.
 Prior to her career in education, she worked in a small savings and loan company, and in the financial services area of a skilled nursing facility. According to Vannoy, it was there that she became interested in the field of information systems.
 “I went into a small partnership that provided technology solutions to healthcare organizations. While working with the partnership, I was asked to teach a class in the Department of Computer Information Systems in the Walker College of Business,” Vannoy said. “By the end of the first week, I knew that I had found my calling, and shortly thereafter, joined Appalachian’s Walker College of Business faculty full time.”
 Vannoy taught in the Department of Computer Information Systems for several years before attending graduate school and earning a doctoral degree in Information Systems from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
 “My dissertation led to what has probably been my favorite published research project, working with a global manufacturing company to identify the role played by information systems in top management’s decision-making process,” Vannoy said.
 She returned to Appalachian State as a faculty member in 2009, and in 2014 was asked to serve as assistant dean for graduate programs and research. Vannoy was promoted to associate dean for graduate programs and research in 2015.
 Vannoy has directed the MBA and honors programs since 2014. She is a firm believer in student participation in activities that will impact both their personal and professional growth.
 “The MBA can increase a trajectory toward leadership positions, and we often have individuals enter the program because the MBA is necessary for promotion or salary increase,” Vannoy said. “I would also say be ready to be stretched beyond your comfort zone. And that’s important for developing leadership skills.”
 She has also led the development of a new online MBA program, which is set to launch this fall.
 WCOB has experienced alumni asking them to create an online MBA program for years and they are looking forward to offering this opportunity to current and former students, Vannoy said.
 Vannor said the school is excited to be able to deliver the same high quality educational opportunities provided to on-campus students for working professionals and others who want the Walker MBA, but may be unable for various reasons to attend traditional face-to-face classes.
 According to Vannoy, the program will follow the same program of study used by on-campus students and classes will be taught by the same world-class faculty who teach in their on-campus program.
 Haley Childers who serves as the communications director for the Walker College of Business, said that the school now has the largest undergraduate enrollment in the 16-college UNC system. Childers said they have had the highest for several years — but were unaware of the fact. According to Vannoy, school officials were doing some research on a report for their accreditation and the person completing the report pointed out the statistic concerning enrollment.
 In regard to her current position, Vannoy said she was motivated to accept the position of acting dean because she has a heart for service.
 The years she spent as an associate dean for programs and research under the leadership of Dr. Heather Norris, recently appointed Interim Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, taught her that serving the institution was important to her.
 “When I was offered the opportunity to serve as acting dean, I didn’t hesitate. We have incredible students, and an amazing team of faculty and staff,” Vannoy said. “Leading the Walker College is an extraordinary honor for me.”
 WCOB has a number of major initiatives underway that she will continue to facilitate, with major emphasis on international experiences, sustainable business and experiential learning.
 A sustainable business curriculum is offered at all levels, ranging from the sustainable business undergraduate minor which is open to all majors to the MBA with a concentration in sustainability.
 To optimize future success, students are learning not only the business and professional skills needed to be successful, but also to be adaptable and agile.
 Opportunities offered by WCOB that allow experiential learning are internships and short-term study abroad programs.
 Many internships are coordinated through a dedicated team of business career services staff and are a key experience that most WCOB students participate in while at Appalachian.
 Vannoy has personally led several study abroad programs over the years and will continue to a strong proponent of the importance of global awareness for students.
 “I’ve been with the Walker College for a long time and this is my home. I feel very honored that I was given this opportunity,” Vannoy said.

 The Illinois primary is March 17.
 Under the law, any qualified voter who has been admitted to a hospital, nursing home or rehabilitation center due to an illness or injury not more than 14 days before an election can have a ballot delivered to them by a relative or a registered voter from their home precinct. In order to get the ballot, they must fill out an application and also have a certificate concerning the reason they can't vote in person from a physician, advanced practice registered nurse or physician assistant.
 The relative or same-precinct registered voter needs to take the paperwork to the election office -- which in Peoria County is the Peoria County Election Commission, 4422 N. Brandywine Dr.; is the county clerk's office in Tazewell County, in the McKenzie Building at 11 S. 4th St., Suite 203; and is the county clerk's office in Woodford County, at the courthouse, 115 N. Main St., Suite 202. There, the paperwork is checked and notarized, and the vote-by-mail ballot can then be hand-delivered to the voter. The filled-out ballot must be returned to the election office by 7 p.m. on Election Day.
 Information on the process is provided to managers on each unit at OSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center so they can make it available to patients, a spokeswoman there said.
 Voters may also apply online or over the phone to receive a vote-by-mail ballot through noon on Thursday. It must be postmarked by Election Day to be counted.

I’ve never seen -- we were flying over; you see the blue roofs going up. It’s all over the place," Trump added.
