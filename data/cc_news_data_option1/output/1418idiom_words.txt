The Narendra Modi government, however, came under flak from certain sections of the Opposition. The Centre had last month choked the export of HCQ and other key drugs in view of coronavirus turning into a pandemic. Critics of the ruling dispensation saw a reversal in decision as a direct outcome of the "threat" issued by US President Donald Trump.

Trump, in a press briefing on Monday, said India would face "retaliations" if Prime Minister Modi declines his request to resume HCQ exports. After the Indian government removed the anti-malarial drug from the list of pharmaceutical items barred from exports, the US President showered heaps of praises, saying Modi is playing a "leadership role for the humanity" in the fight against COVID-19.
