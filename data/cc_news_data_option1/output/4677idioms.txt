Trump has pushed for a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of the year, but so far the Pentagon has no orders to do that.

President Donald Trump has not stopped his obsessive effort to discredit an election that he lost by a wide margin. He continues to spread lies and misinformation to his nearly 90 million Twitter followers, alleging that the election was rigged. On Sunday, he appeared to acknowledge for the first time that Joe Biden won, blaming his loss on baseless and debunked conspiracy theories about the election. He backtracked the acknowledgment in a later tweet and asserted that the fight has only begun. "I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go," he said. Since Biden was declared the President-elect, Trump has spent no time answering questions from reporters he doesn't perceive as allies.

The Seafood Extravaganza is not a weekly fixed event and depends upon the numbers of diners to ensure the freshness of the various seafood. On our night this was Tuna, River Prawns, Lobster and Barramundi (plus other items such as French Apple Tarte), but also showed the inventive nature of Chef Kenneth who had presented the seafood in different ways, such as a Tartare of Tuna with a home-made Wasabi Mayonnaise. All too often have we seen prawns on ice as if they were a main item. This not what you will get at Thai Garden Resort.

"Trump took us off that path, and Biden in the first 100 days can put us back on that path."

El Sindicato de Enfermeria (Satse) denuncia "una vez mas" la "penosa situacion que se vive en las residencias de mayores" de Galicia debido a la "sobrecarga de trabajo" porque "una enfermera se encarga de mas de cien pacientes y lo hace ademas en unas condiciones penosas".
 Asi lo destaca en un comunicado de prensa, en el que Satse recuerda que el "problema" de plantilla enfermera "es de base" porque "habitualmente estas residencias no cuentan con el numero de enfermeras suficiente", abunda.
 "Ahora, hay que reforzar los turnos para que un mismo personal no atienda a pacientes Covid y no Covid en un mismo turno y, ademas, se suma el hecho de que hay profesionales de enfermeria de baja por positivo en Covid-19, lo que ademas de ser una falta de respeto hacia los profesionales, por la proteccion, tambien agrava la falta de enfermeras", explica este sindicato.
 Esto ocurre, puntualiza, "en centros como Campolongo, donde no se ha dotado de enfermeras para poder cumplir los protocolos de sectorizacion que requiere la propia Xunta para la prevencion de contagios" y, por tanto, sostiene, "se incumplen deliberadamente dichos protocolos porque se niegan a contratar acumulos de tareas de enfermeras como si se ha hecho en otros centros".
 Por otro lado, indica que "la falta de enfermeras tambien se ha resentido en el CRAPD de Vigo", en donde "se han visto desbordadas por las tareas que se han añadido (relacionadas con la deteccion de casos y con dar cumplimiento a todos los protocolos de prevencion)" a las habituales, matiza Satse, "donde ya de por si habia sobrecarga de trabajo y solo se ha contratado 1 enfermera en acumulo de tareas para cada centro".
 En el mismo sentido apunta que "no se les ha facilitado ningun tipo de formacion para la realizacion de las PCR a las enfermeras, sin embargo es algo exigido por el servicio de Medicina Preventiva".
 "Desde la Conselleria de Politica Social no se ha se planteado ningun refuerzo de la plantilla y es el mismo numero, ya escaso antes de la pandemia, de enfermeras que debe de atender una situacion tan complicada como la actual tremendamente sobrecargada de trabajo", ha señalado Satse. Ademas, añade que "es una necesidad urgente en una situacion como la actual", ya que las profesionales de enfermeria "no pueden seguir asumiendo esa tremenda carga de trabajo", apostilla.
 Asimismo, incide en que este personal "lleva arrastrando esa sobrecarga fisica y psicologica desde el mes de marzo, sin que Politica Social aumente la plantilla y refuerce a un personal que ha estado y sigue estando en primera linea de lucha contra el Covid-19 y realizando una asistencia que es fundamental para una poblacion tan vulnerable como son los mayores y las personas con discapacidad".
 Ante esta "lamentable realidad", Satse reclama "un aumento de las plantillas de enfermeras/os en las residencias de mayores", tras haber constatado que "el grave deficit existente de estos profesionales ha sido determinante en la grave incidencia de la Covid-19 entre las personas mayores residentes en estos centros sociosanitarios".
 El Sindicato de Enfermeria exige tambien que la Xunta "haga una vigilancia exhaustiva en todas las residencias de mayores" de la comunidad de titularidad publica y que, de manera paralela, "aseguren que los centros de caracter privado o concertado cumplen con todas las condiciones exigidas para atender a todos sus residentes de manera digna y optima, sin olvidar un reconocimiento economico a sus profesionales, a traves de los salarios, dada la gran sobrecarga y responsabilidad que tienen cada dia".

Vermont Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday that starting Saturday at 10 p.m. public and private gatherings of different households are banned. Bars must close by 10 p.m., and restaurants can offer only takeout after 10 p.m. All youth recreational sports will also be banned for the time being, he said.
 Scott said there will be no enforcement of the ban on multi-household gatherings. But he hopes residents will abide by an honor system. If these gatherings still happen and produce outbreaks, more stringent enforcement could occur, he said.

The US surpassed 11 million coronavirus infections over the weekend, and states are rushing to set up restrictions as hospitalizations grow. Just six days ago, there were 10 million cases nationwide. Health experts are calling the pandemic a "humanitarian" crisis and pleading with President Trump to allow transition talks between his health officials and aides of President- elect Joe Biden. The incoming White House chief of staff said their team has not talked to current top health officials about the pandemic because of Trump's refusal to trigger ascertainment — the formal process of opening a transition to a new administration. Instead, Biden's team is getting up to speed on the pandemic response by back-channeling with governors, members of the private sector and the medical community.
