According to a Thursday news release from Warren, a just two-page "Prioritizing Pandemic Prevention Act" would fund American response to the deadly zoonotic disease, which originated in China last month, by reclaiming roughly $10 billion set aside by the Trump administration for the construction of a "racist" wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

The first person to file a trademark gets exclusive rights to distribute and sell a product (generally do business) under that trademark. Even if you are a large, well-known company abroad, another entity can easily file a trademark claim on your company’s name and logo. If they are the first to do it, they receive the trademark and you have little recourse. That person would be able to stop you from distributing and doing business under your own name and logo in China, even if you have been in business longer.

Chikomba (variously translated as hellhole, burning crater), the place name adopted by defeated Africans, partially harks back to these historical burning incidents. One of Zezurus’ cultural beliefs is that there are resilient ties between the living and their deceased relatives (midzimu). Accordingly, some of Mujuru’s family members understood his participation in the anti-colonial struggle from the 1960s to independence in 1980, as stirred by Mwendamberi midzimu that clashed with European settlers in the 1890s. In light of this belief in midzimu, some of which met a flaming end, one may venture to ask whether it is purely happenstance that Mujuru’s end, and much of his life, had fire as an enduring theme. Mujuru was fireborn: from the 1952 fire in Mujuru’s childhood, to the blood and fire that is the life of a guerrilla fighter, to the great hotel fire Mujuru started at the failed 1976 independence conference in Geneva, to an early 1980s bedroom fire Mujuru’s lit cigarette touched off while he and his wife Joice slept, to the 2011 fire that sang Mujuru’s demise by other means.

The state dual championship trophy had belonged to Louisville's wrestling team for less than 15 minutes before senior Jax Leonard acknowledged what every Leopard already knew.
   
 That trophy was merely a beginning, not an ending.
   
 "We just know that, yeah, we just won a state title," Leonard said after the state dual tournament on Feb. 16. "But it's still not over. We still have state championships to win."
   
 Team championships remain possible as the individual tournament gets underway at the sectional level Saturday, especially for a Louisville team loaded with highly-ranked wrestlers. However, any team titles won over the next three weeks will be the accumulation of whatever each individual wrestler accomplished on their own.
   
 Obviously, that's true whether it's in an individual or dual tournament setting. However, at this time of year, the focus is entirely on each individual working toward their ultimate goals, starting with finishing in the top four in the weight class this weekend to advance to the district tournament.
   
 To that end, one thing that's always good to have on one side is positive momentum. Each weekend, each tournament, may be its own separate entity, but it never hurts to go into the next one having finished on a good note in the previous one.
   
 "It's always good," Tuslaw coach Chase Horvath said "Anytime you feel confident, that's momentum. When you're getting on a roll and you're getting confident and comfortable, then you're going to wrestle better."
   
 Horvath's team, which will join Central Catholic and Dalton in the 14-team Division III sectional at Northwestern, may be one of the definitions of riding positive momentum. The Mustangs are coming off their seventh consecutive PAC-7 championship, with five different individuals also winning titles at the league meet.
   
 Tuslaw, though, isn't the only one heading into the first weekend on a roll. Not surprisingly, many of those teams doing so are ones quite familiar with what it takes to achieve postseason success.
   
 Perry's season has been one of ups and downs as it has battled vacant spots in its lineup along with the growing pains of a program trying to get back to the elite level it has been over the last two decades. However, the Panthers head to Wadsworth, where it will join the rest of Stark County's Division I teams in the 10-team sectional, coming off of the high of a 35-27 dual-meet win over Lake which gave them their 22nd consecutive Federal League championship.
   
 "Obviously, confidence goes a long way in this sport," Perry coach Brent McBurney said. "It's so mental. I would say we're the most confident we've been all year, and rightfully so. We just beat ourselves up with our schedule at the beginning of the year. Now, after the last couple of weeks ... our confidence is good and we just really have to focus on the sectional."
   
 It was only six years ago, in 2014, where Perry was in a place very similar to where Louisville now sits. Back then, the Panthers were coming off a state dual championship, and were turning their eyes toward duplicating the feat at the state individual tournament.
   
 Now, the Leopards are the ones who go into the individual postseason wearing a bull's-eye of sorts. They're the team which will carry the momentum of that state title won just two weeks ago, but also the understanding that the one doesn't necessarily guarantee another.
   
 For Louisville, the journey starts in the 12-team Division II sectional at Northwest. The Leopards will be joined by fellow Stark County schools Canton South, Fairless and the host Indians, as well as talented teams from places like CVCA and Triway.
   
 Not only will Louisville be looking to repeat the state title accomplishments from the dual tournament, it has a couple of wrestlers looking to duplicate the successes they achieved in last year's individual state tournament. Garett Lautzenheiser and Davin Rhoads are the lone Stark County wrestlers who will be looking to repeat as individual state championships, while trying to become the first Leopards to ever win two state titles.
   
 "It's just go time again for three weeks,," Rhoads said after the state dual tournament. "After that, we've got all the time we want."

The Bulldogs adjusted after halftime though, and only allowed two total threes from Kentucky in the second half. UGA head coach Joni Taylor says that was a mix of her team’s defensive adjustments and Kentucky just missing open shots.
 “Kentucky came out red hot (in the first half) and we weren’t locked in,” Taylor said. “Give them credit, they have players you have to defend on every spot on the floor… And then I think we buckled down defensively and got better with that through the third quarter and came out and played defense the way we’re used to playing defense and tried to take away their opportunities to score the three.”
 Another huge factor for Kentucky was free throw shooting—the Cats shot 20-of-21 for 95 percent from the free throw line. Roper played a major part in that as she went a perfect 11-for-11 from the line.
 “I try to relax, that’s why I close my eyes. I kind of stole that from (Immanuel) Quickley,” Roper said. “Just focusing my mind to hit a shot that I practice almost every single day.”
 The win was special for the Kentucky seniors in a lot of ways, but especially for Anyagaligbo, who says her mom was there in attendance to watch her play for the first time since her senior year of high school.
 “I was so nervous, I just didn’t want to fail her,” Anyagaligbo said. “I’m just happy we got the win, because for me that was-- I have a weight lifted off my shoulder and I just really appreciate that we could pull it off like that.”
 The Cats return to the floor on Sunday, March 1 in Nashville to take on Vanderbilt.

The technical launch of first Doha-class air defense corvette ordered by the Qatari Ministry of Defence within the national naval acquisition program, took place at Fincantieri's shipyard in Muggiano (La Spezia).      The corvette Al Zubarah is named after a ruined and ancient fort located on the north western coast of the Qatar peninsula in the Al Shamal municipality, about 105 km from the Qatari capital of Doha.      The vessel, which will be delivered in 2021, is designed consistent with the RINAMIL rules, said a release by Fincantieri.      "She will be a flexible type of ship capable of fulfilling a range of tasks, from surveillance with sea rescue capabilities to being a fighting vessel, being about 107 meters long, 14.70 meters wide, with a maximum speed of 28 knots," it said.      The unit will be provided with a combined diesel and diesel plant (CODAD) and will be able to accommodate 112 persons on board.      Furthermore, the vessel will be capable of operating high-speed boats such as RHIB (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat) through lateral cranes or a hauling ramp located at the far stern. The flight deck and hangar will be sized for hosting one NH90 helicopter.

INDIANAPOLIS — Punters tend to be quirky people.
 Despite being on a team with 80 or so others, they often spend time alone, walking the sideline with just themselves and a football.
 Don’t hang that tag on Alex Pechin. To be sure, the fifth-year senior from Bucknell University has his eccentricities. Anyone who lists “physics homework grader” as part of his work experience on LinkedIn is sure to turn heads in any locker room.
 Pechin thinks of himself more as part of the defense than a special teamer off doing his own thing. A two-year captain, he cheers when his offense scores, and he relishes games where his talents aren’t needed.
 When the time comes that Pechin is called upon, the Bison have not seen his equal.
 Now, Pechin is looking for a new team, one that pays a lot better than student assistant. That starts this week with the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, where Pechin met with media Wednesday.
 “It’s been a great experience. I am trying to enjoy it as much as I can,” said Pechin, who is the only Patriot League player out of the 337 invitees at the Combine. “I know one guy, and there are a few familiar faces. But I’m also one of the few without a roommate, so I have a little bit of down time.”
 Flying solo is the dream for most special teams guys. They mostly practice separated from teammates, and many programs don’t even huddle on a punt. It’s all hand signals or flash cards from the sideline.
 Pechin isn’t like that. He likes to talk shop and compare notes. He had an opportunity to do that Tuesday with the 32 NFL special teams coaches who met with all of the kickers and punters at the Combine.
 “They asked a lot of questions,” Pechin said. “They want to make sure I can explain what I’m doing. Some people can just repeat what their coaches tell them, but these coaches want to know what you can see on your own in the film room.”
 At the NFL level, punters must be able to study film then identify presnap where strengths and weaknesses are before adjusting accordingly to place the ball at the right height, length and angle.
 It isn’t just wind up and boot the ball as far as you can.

"I think when things get tough, that’s when we see guys start to drop their heads a little bit," Hoiberg said. "I know it’s human nature when you go through struggles like that, especially with as long of a slide as we’ve had with guys who haven’t dealt with that that much.
 "When things are going well, you can see the enthusiasm. We almost get a 'Here we go again' mentality when things start to get rough. We have to find a way to fight through that in these last three games and the Big Ten Tournament if we have any chance of winning."
 Ohio State (19-9, 9-8) controlled the game on both ends of the floor from the opening tip, making nine of its first 11 shots and five of its first six 3-point attempts. That led to a 12-2 Buckeye run that put Nebraska (7-21, 2-15) in a 28-12 hole 10 minutes into the first half.
 The Buckeyes’ lead would balloon to as much as 21 before settling on a 43-27 halftime advantage. NU shot just 37.5 percent, missed all six of its 3-pointers, had seven shots blocked, and turned the ball over seven times in the first 20 minutes.
 On the other side, OSU shot 48 percent, made six threes, went 9-of-10 from the free-throw line, and scored 14 points in the paint.
 "I don't think I got an open look until three minutes left on the clock, so they were doing a really good job guarding me," junior guard Thorir Thorbjarnarson said. "But also we got some good looks, but the ball wasn't going it. It's hard when they get five threes right off the bat of the game and have to dig yourselves out of a hole."
 Things didn’t get any better after halftime, either. Nebraska got as close as 14 a couple of minutes into the second half, but Ohio State’s defense continued to stifle NU the rest of the way.
 The Huskers never got any closer than that, and the Buckeyes’ lead grew to as much as 23 before all was said and done.
 OSU big man Kaleb Wesson dominated the paint all night and finished with game- highs in both points (16) and rebounds (18) and went 10-of-13 from the free- throw line, setting Pinnacle Bank Arena opponent records for free throws made and attempted.
 Dachon Burke led Nebraska with 13 points while Cam Mack added 12, marking his first game in double figures since Feb. 8 at Iowa. Thorbjarnarson, who entered the game ranked fifth in the Big Ten in 3-point percentage, scored just four points and missed both of his 3-point attempts but did add a game-high four assists.
 Nebraska will play its final home game of the season Sunday when it hosts Northwestern on Senior Day. Tip-off is 3:15 p.m. CT and the game will be televised on BTN.
 "With three games to go, we just have to try to get some momentum going into that, and we have a perfect opportunity on Sunday," Thorbjarnarson said. "I think that's going to be a key game for us to head into the (Big Ten) tournament in Indianapolis.”

“Meeting the GMs and coaches from these teams you grow up watching and see as a little kid …,” he said. “You get to shake their hands and meet them as people and talk football.”
 Life wasn’t this easy or simple for Gross-Matos when he was younger. When he was 2 years old, his biological father died saving Gross-Matos from drowning following a boating accident. When he was 11, his brother died after being struck by lightning.
 His anchor through it all has been his mother.
 “She’s a phenomenal woman,” he said. “She’s sacrificed a lot and lost a lot. She’s the best person I know.”
 Former Penn State coach Sean Spencer also has helped shape Gross-Matos into the person he is — on and off the field. Spencer helped Gross-Matos navigate his return from a suspension last summer that cost the player a chance to prepare for his junior year alongside his teammates.
 “He’s a father to guys, a lot of guys who don’t have fathers,” Gross-Matos said of Spencer, now with the New York Giants. “He taught us so much and made me the person and player that I am.
 “The biggest thing is staying positive with all the things that happen in life. You can’t get sad. Life’s not guaranteed, so you’ve got to stay positive and take opportunities when you can.”
 Those opportunities will include a chance to play in front of big crowds again, something Gross-Matos is looking forward to.
 Penn State will always have a special place in his heart, and no matter how loud or intense it gets during an NFL game — like the other obstacles in his path — it will be nothing new for him.
 “There’s no stadium that can get as loud as Beaver Stadium,” he said. “On third down, it gets so loud, your whole body shakes. It’s like turbulence.”

 John Raymond Hipple, Johnny, eternal partner of Kristy and beloved father of Micah and Aidan, died unexpectedly of natural causes at his home in Surf City, N.J. on Saturday, Feb. 22, 2020.  He was 41. Born Sept. 3, 1978 in Trenton, N.J., Johnny was the oldest son of Susan Palsho Hipple and John Raymond Hipple, and Sherpa to siblings, Kate and Jason. Growing up in Washington Crossing, Pa., and still today, Johnny is their North Star. Johnny graduated from Notre Dame High School, where he was a standout ice hockey player and memorialized as the most unique person by peers who voted him Most Likely to Be Out Of Uniform. He went on to study at Green Mountain University, which ultimately led to his most important accomplishment, his son, Micah.  Johnny's chosen profession was barkeep. With his laid-back ways and love of people, Johnny was born for the role, which drew on skills he honed tracing the exact footpath his grandfather had for many decades before at Ernie's Tavern. He would often say that all he did for a living was spill liquor, but the warm comfort and spirited hospitality Johnny brought to his patrons was a transcendental experience. He was fortunate enough to settle in his favorite place in the world, by the Barnegat Bay, where he spent time with his family, the waves and his thoughts.  Johnny was an avant-garde musician and a natural comedian who carried peace and kindness everywhere he went. Johnny was the coolest, the humblest, deeply spiritual and a fiercely loyal father, friend and teacher. But more than anything, Johnny's super power was his sweet, sensitive soul, which indelibly touched his family, friends, and every dog he ever met. Johnny was caring and kind to all; when he talked to you, he folded you into his big heart and you felt like you were truly special while all along it was Johnny who was most special of all.  Johnny, with his beautiful eyes and endless smile, will be forever missed by all who knew him. Johnny was preceded in death by his grandparents, James and Ella Hipple and Ernest and Catherine Palsho. Along with his parents, partner, Kristy Neall, and sons, Micah Laborde Hipple and Aidan Neall, Johnny is survived by family members including Sandy Davall, Barry Davall, Jeff Davall, Karin Warner, Sue Davall, Tim Warner, Katherine Warner, Jack Warner, Ava Warner, Hank Davall, Faye Davall, Benjamin Davall, Chuck Palsho, Allison Palsho, Charlie Palsho, Hayley Palsho, JoAnn Hathazi, Mike Hatazi, Mikey Hathazi, Lauren Hathazi, Genevieve Panzica, Dodi Mahnovksi, Sergej Mahnovski, Adrian Mahnovski, Sebastian Mahnovski, Cathy Lubby, David Lubbe, Morgan Lubbe, Jules Lubbe, Herb McGee, Crissy McGee, Kelly McGee, Erin McGee, Carrie McGee, Christopher McGee, Elizabeth McGee, Annie Marks, Tracy Markham, Evelyn Moonan, Emily McGee, Bill McGee, Billy McGee, Cheri Hipple, Robin Rutter, Krissy Haesler Ellis, BonBon Haesler, Jana Haesler Keller, Bill Hipple, Marilynn Hipple, Hal Pitkow, Susan Hipple, Becky Pitkow, Mike Harris, Erica Pitkow, Ben Pitkow, Henry Hipple, Judy Hipple, Henry Hipple Jr., Tommy Hipple, Danielle Galasso, Sophie Galasso, Emma Galasso, Owen Galasso, Corboy, JR, Jimmy Evans, Malabee, and Tank.

TWO incidents described as bizarre and despicable led to the arrest of a middle-aged father, and serious questions about his mental health when he appeared in court.
 In a bail application made on behalf of defendant Stephen Tahata, Ipswich Magistrates Court heard there were no issues with his mental health that might explain his alleged behaviour.
 Tahata, 56, from Spring Mountain, is charged with committing robbery at Booval on February 21; and sexual assault at Ipswich on February 22.
 Prosecutor Sergeant Brad Dick said the alleged incidents were bizarre and the sexual assault despicable as it occurred in the waiting room of the emergency department at Ipswich Hospital.
 Magistrate Virginia Sturgess asked if there were any underlying mental health problems that could explain the alleged incidents.
 Sgt Dick said a mental health report found there were none that would suggest an explanation.
 He said Tahata was treated at Ipswich Hospital for a possible head injury, adding that further investigation would be required to see if there had been a blow to the head.
 Defence lawyer Kelsea Read said that while the charges were unusual Tahata was not an unacceptable risk to the public.
 Ms Sturgess said there was very little information in the report and the court had to be satisfied he would not pose a risk to other people in light of the allegations.
 “I understand he had fallen from a veranda,” Ms Read said.
 “He later presented to the hospital where the second charge followed.”
 “He apparently attempted to throw himself off a veranda.“ Ms Sturgess suggested.
 “That’s one version. He did suffer a fall,” Ms Read said.
 Ms Sturgess said the robbery charge related to a shop assistant being punched at Booval.
 She said Tahata had no criminal history and had been assessed by the mental health unit at Ipswich Hospital with no mental health issues.
 Bail was granted and his matters will return to court on March 18.

As a family of four, we hit Gore Mountain last week during President’s Week.
 Yes, there were plenty of destination skiers and riders, as well as day users, yet that is no issue for Gore Mountain in the ADKs. Gore has developed into a massive area, nine faces of four unique peaks, and 14 lifts including the eight-passenger Northwoods Gondola and two high-speed quads that keeps us all out of those lines.
 In addition, we also take advantage of Gore’s extensive parking options and shuttle service, which quickly helps us get to the Base Lodge.
 After having begun an early day of skiing at Gore, our first lift was the 8-passenger Northwoods Gondola, with the destination in mind of the summit and the Straight Brook Area. Following a winter storm that hit Gore last week and Gore’s extensive snowmaking, most everything was open including some fun- filled glades. Twice with the kids, we skied the trees in the Straight Brook Glades, finding soft bumps and packed-powder, and ended up skiing the bumps under the Straight Brook Quad.
 We also hit the bumps on the double-black Rumor, which was in excellent shape. To us it felt like skiing out West, with the snow-covered trees, plentiful packed-powder and crazy-steep, bumped-up terrain.
 After having spent time on the slopes off the summit, we ventured over to Little Gore Mountain and the North Creek Ski Bowl. To get there, after having enjoyed a respite at the mid-mountain Saddle Lodge, we skied the North Side and shushed down the blue, Powder Pass, to connect with Pipeline Traverse.
 Located at the foot of Little Gore Mountain, one of Gore’s four developed peaks, the North Creek Ski Bowl keeps a cherished history close, while steadily unfolding a variety of new adventures to discover. A year-round recreation and community complex, the Ski Bowl offers alpine skiing and snowboarding, freestyle fun, Nordic skiing and snowshoeing, mountain biking, hiking, dinning and more.
 Gore’s peak, Burnt Ridge Mountain, was our next destination with the goal to ski the rolling black-cruiser, Sagmore. And, find some glades action. The Sagmore trail is the source of five extensive glades, including the Cirque Glades, Sagamore Glades, Abenaki Glades, Barkeater Glades, and the Boreas Glades.
 Please allow my special “shout-out” to the Cirque Glades. This wooded terrain begins with a true narrow shoot between rock faces, similar to shoots I’ve experienced skiing out West, then opens up to become quite lengthy and spectacularly-fun glades skiing, which herds snow adventurers back to the Burnt Ridge Quad.
 Our finial destination and skiing of the day was off Gore’s peak, Bear Mountain, and the Northwoods Area. There we were able to experience the newly constructed 4,000-foot competition-level Freestyle Cross Course on Wild Air and Pot Luck. Gore has modified the course and it is now open for everyone to enjoy.
 On Wild Air and Pot Luck, Gore will be hosting the NorAm snowboarder/skiercross races (USASA sanctioned events), Slopestyle Competition and Rail Jam, on Saturday and Sunday, March 7-8.
 As the last hurrah, we checkout the stash of beginner features on Jibland and the nice lineup of features on Lower Sleighride. There's lots of action at Gore. Visit www.goremountain.com.

Environ 200 agents hospitaliers de Creil et Compiegne confines chez eux
 Environ 200 agents hospitaliers travaillant dans les hopitaux de Creil et Compiegne (Oise), ou ont sejourne cette semaine deux patients infectes par le coronavirus, sont confines chez eux par mesure de precaution, a-t-on appris aupres de la CGT et du maire de Compiegne. À l'hopital de Creil - qui a pris en charge pendant six jours l'enseignant de 60 ans decede dans la nuit de mardi a mercredi - une trentaine d'infirmiers, 24 aides-soignants, 15 medecins, des agents d'entretien, deux equipes du Smur qui ont gere le patient au service de reanimation et quatre agents des urgences qui seraient passes d'un service a l'autre doivent rester chez eux pendant 14 jours, a indique a l'AFP Corinne Delys, secretaire generale de la CGT de l'etablissement. " _90% du personnel de r eanimation, qui compte 15 lits, est confine_", a-t-elle affirme.
 L'Agence regionale de sante des Hauts-de-France a ferme mercredi le service de reanimation adultes et l'unite de soins continu jusqu'au 10 mars inclus. " _Face a la mise en confinement pour 14 jours d'une grande partie des professionnels qui ont ete en contact direct avec le patient, il n'est pas possible d'assurer cette mission du service public dans des conditions normales_", a explique dans un communique jeudi le groupe hospitalier public du sud de l'Oise (GHPSO), qui comprend l'etablissement de Creil, refusant toutefois de confirmer le nombre d'agents confines. Selon Mme Delys, la fermeture de ces services " _va cr eer des problematiques de fonctionnement sur le Smur pour couvrir les besoins sur le departement_".
 " _L' equipe de Smur de Senlis est en grande difficulte et celle de Creil aussi. On avait deja des difficultes prealables, comme beaucoup de services d'urgence, et la elles se sont aggravees avec les mesures de confinement_", a-t-elle ajoute. "La regulation (du Smur) va s'arracher les cheveux". Selon le GHPSO " _il n 'y a aucun danger_" pour les visiteurs " _a ce jour_".
 A l'hopital de Compiegne, ou a sejourne un autre patient aujourd'hui hospitalise au CHU d'Amiens, " _117 agents ayant eu des contacts avec le malade font l'objet de contr oles et sont soumis a des mesures d'isolement a domicile_", a indique a l'AFP le maire de Compiegne Philippe Marini.

Additionally, rising incidences of the infections to the vagina and urinary tract, and uterus due to fungus and other serious issues is boosting the need for advanced medications, which is augmenting the adoption of the hysterometers. These are key factors driving the growth of the hysterometers market.

2019 was also a good year for gamigo in terms of financing. In the first half of 2019, further tranches of the senior secured corporate bond in the amount of EUR 18 million were placed at a price above par. Following the bond issues, the outstanding volume amounts to EUR 50 million, thus exhausting the entire framework of the bond. By placing further bonds, gamigo has raised additional capital from international investors. In contrast to bank loans, this gives gamigo greater flexibility with regard to M&A, which often requires quick decisions. This flexibility gives us an advantage over our competitors in the M&A processes. The price of the bond on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is currently 103.88% and reflects the Group's high credit rating.

Personalità artistica di estremo rilievo, Pietro Fenoglio contribuisce in modo particolare a rimodellare Torino secondo il gusto Liberty. Nato a Torino nel 1865, l’architetto-ingegnere orienta il suo campo d’interesse nell’edilizia residenziale e nell’architettura industriale. Nato da una famiglia di costruttori edili, frequenta la Regia Scuola di Applicazione per ingegneri di Torino; subito dopo la laurea, conseguita nel 1889, inizia un’intensa attività lavorativa, raggiungendo ottimi risultati in ambito architettonico. Partecipa, nel 1902, all’Organizzazione internazionale di Arte Decorativa Moderna di Torino e in quest’occasione approfondisce la conoscenza dello stile liberty, riuscendo poi a concretizzare quanto appreso nei numerosi interventi edilizi di carattere residenziale, ancora oggi visibili nel territorio cittadino. La sua attività di progettista si estende anche al campo dell’architettura industriale, come testimoniano la Conceria Fiorio (1900 - Via Durandi, 11) o la Manifattura Gilardini (1904 - Lungo Dora Firenze, 19). Nel 1912, Pietro entra a far parte del Consiglio di Amministrazione della Banca Commerciale Italiana ed è tra i promotori della SocietàIdroelettrica Piemonte. Colto da morte improvvisa, Pietro Fenoglio muore il 22 agosto 1927, a soli 62 anni, nella grande casa di famiglia a Corio Canavese.

CAIRO (AP) — A commercial ship has rescued 35 Europe-bound migrants off Libya's Mediterranean coast and returned them to the capital, Tripoli, the U.N. migration agency said. The International Organization for Migration tweeted that migrants, who were intersected on Thursday, were given medical assistance and relief items upon disembarkation. “Saving lives at sea is a moral and legal obligation. It is however unacceptable that migrants continue to be returned to an unsafe port,” said the IOM. Libya, which descended into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, has emerged as a major transit point for African and Arab migrants fleeing war and poverty to Europe. Most migrants make the perilous journey in ill-equipped and unsafe rubber boats. As of last October, roughly 19,000 migrants have drowned or disappeared on the sea route since 2014, according to IOM. Last week, a rubber dinghy packed with 91 migrants that set out from Libyan shores for Europe, apparently went missing in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea after leaving Libya on Feb. 8. In recent years, the European Union has partnered with the coast guard and other Libyan forces to stop the flow of migrants. Rights groups say those efforts have left migrants at the mercy of brutal armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers that lack adequate food and water. The latest developments come amid criticism of the European Union’s lack of rescue missions in the Mediterranean Sea. Member countries agreed earlier this month to end an anti-migrant smuggler operation involving only surveillance aircraft and instead deploy military ships to concentrate on upholding a widely flouted U.N. arms embargo that's considered key to winding down Libya's relentless war.

Qualcomm’s latest 5G modem isn’t the leap that the X55 was last year, but it might be more important. While the Snapdragon X60 5G Modem-RF System touts a slew of technical and practical enhancements to take full advantage of the next-generation networks’ tremendous speeds, Qualcomm’s new modem isn’t built for phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 that are already on board with 5G, it’s made for the one that isn’t: the iPhone.
 Let’s get the technical stuff out of the way first. The X60 is the first “to support spectrum aggregation across all key 5G bands and combinations.” That means X60 phones will be more futureproof than today’s X55 ones, supporting mmWave and sub-6 using frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) at a wider range of deployment. Plus, it can deliver up to 7.5Gbps download speeds and 3Gbps upload speeds, far greater than even the theoretical capabilities of the current 5G networks being built.
 But while benefits like carrier aggregation and voice-over-NR are certainly important, the greatest improvement the X60 modem offers is in its size. Qualcomm’s new modem is the first to be built using a 5nm process, allowing for higher efficiency on a smaller footprint. That’s a big leap from the 7nm X50 and X55, and it’s unlikely anyone will be able to catch up anytime soon, including Apple. And that’s precisely the message Qualcomm wants to send.

The rock art depicts traditional Aboriginal creation stories and the cave is a popular stop for tour groups undertaking the Uluru base walk.
 It is on the opposite side of the rock to the former entrance to climb the rock, which closed in October last year.
 The cave's basin is often filled with water when there has been rain and there is a viewing platform above this basin for tourists.
 Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Visitor and Tourism Manager Steven Baldwin said up to a third of the cave was covered with vegetable oil, with the paintings still visible but obscured.
 Mr Baldwin said he was "absolutely aghast" when he first heard about the damage to the paintings, which he estimated were tens of thousands of years old.

The key assumptions in the cash flow projections for the Plan are the revenue growth and operating margin for each division. Operating margin is primarily based on the levels achieved in 2019, which are disclosed in note 2, adjusted by targets set for revenue expansion and cost control and reduction for each individual division within the Plan period. The key assumptions underlying the estimation of cash flow projections for value in use are operating profit margin and revenue growth assumptions. The values assigned to these assumptions represent management's assessment of market condition and scope for cost and profitability improvement, taking into account realisable synergies resulting from integration activities. The compound annual revenue growth rate assumption across all three divisions for the next five years ranges from 3.3% to 6.4%. The average operating profit margin assumption for the next five years included within the Packaging division impairment assessment ranges from 8.0% to 11.7%. In respect of Components and Filters, the combined average operating profit margin over the five year forecast period is assumed to improve by 100 bps from 2019.

CHAUMONT — The desire to learn more about how dissolving the village government would affect Chaumont and town of Lyme residents drew about 30 people to an informational meeting about it Wednesday night.
 The dissolution committee and Development Authority of the North Country discussed the effects of consolidating the village and town governments on taxes, services such as garbage and recycling pickup and lighting and more. The predicted outcomes as a result of dissolution are described in the draft alternatives report.
 According to the report, Chaumont taxpayers could experience a drop in taxes by $2.54 per $1,000 in assessed value, while town of Lyme taxpayers could experience an uptick in taxes by seven cents per $1,000 of assessed value.
 A few taxpayers posted questions about how dissolution would affect the status of village workers, possible benefits and who can decide whether to eliminate the village layer of government, among others. Most attendees lived in Chaumont, although some resided in the surrounding town of Lyme.
 James Price, who lives on Water Street, asked how many jobs would be eliminated if the village dissolved. Star Carter, assistant director of engineering for DANC, said the Lyme Town Council would have to decide, adding that she and the committee only factored in the cost of services. Employees, she said, can change over time. The mayor, village trustees and clerk roles will be eliminated if the village dissolves, but what will happen to Department of Public Works employees is uncertain.
 “That is a decision the town board will have to make at a later date. There’s mixed feelings,” said Lyme Town Supervisor Scott A. Aubertine. “Some people think that we’ll need both village employees that are left, and they’re some that think we’ll need only one.”
 Mr. Price, a former mayor, said he believed the town would have to retain certain village workers to maintain a few existing services. He said he initially opposed dissolution, but after hearing the presentation, he was open to the possibility of it. When asked why he remained on the fence, Mr. Price said he needed more time to absorb the information presented Wednesday.
 “I thought it was a very good formal meeting,” he said. I think we can save quite a bit of money really.”
 When villages dissolve, the town governments typically assume most, if not all, of the property, assets, debt and responsibilities of the former villages at the time of dissolution. Other north country villages dissolved their governments and became hamlets in recent years. The village of Morristown consolidated with the town on Dec. 31, and the village of Harrisville government dissolved in 2018.
 The draft alternatives report details not only the predicted effects of eliminating the village layer of government, but also other alternative actions to cut costs for the village if residents or officials rejected dissolution.
 The committee pitched having the town plow more village roads when possible, having village Planning Board member positions become volunteer as opposed to paid, reducing the frequency of trash and recyclable collection to twice a month, or having a contractor haul recycled goods from taxpayer properties as opposed to village staff.
 Reginald J. Schweitzer, Chaumont, asked why the development authority and committee provided no cost benefit analysis illustrating the possible savings for the alternatives outside of dissolution.
 Ms. Carter said with only a year to complete the dissolution study, they only had time to analyze the financial projections for dissolution.
 Offering various options with different cost savings options during a vote could prove difficult and confusing, she said.
 “I would like to see what the savings possibilities were for the other alternatives that were identified,” he said.
 The town of Lyme would continue providing water, sewer, snow removal, beach and street maintenance services to Chaumont residents if the village dissolves. The committee also recommended that the town pave Chaumont streets after dissolution, but not provide a monthly brush pickup service to Chaumont residents.
 The committee encouraged the town to create a special refuse and garbage district for residents living inside village boundaries.
 Creating a district would allow Chaumont taxpayers to keep their municipal garbage and recycling pick-up services, while ensuring no other taxpayers help foot the bill. Chaumont residents would then pay $1.16 per $1,000 on assessed value if the village dissolves.
 If the village government dissolves, the committee recommended that the town pay for lighting services in Chaumont and Three Mile Bay out of the general fund and eliminate the special lighting district in Three Mile Bay.
 Therefore, all taxpayers would help finance lights in both population centers, as opposed to just the people who reside there.
 “When divided amongst the entire town, the lighting costs are minimal,” Ms. Carter said. “Town residents in Three Mile Bay would see a reduction on their town tax bill, as they would no longer have that separate lighting fee.”
 If the village Board of Trustees decides to permit a vote on dissolution, as opposed to rejecting eliminating the village layer of government, only taxpayers registered to vote in the village will be able to participate. Ms. Carter said only village people can create a village, and therefore, they are the only ones who can terminate it.
 When asked whether people who only reside in the village during the summer would be able to vote, Carrie M. Tuttle, director of engineering, said a summertime vote is possible, as it had occurred in Morristown.
 Charles Sidwa, a town of Lyme resident, said the town is not receiving any savings and not having the ability to vote on the dissolution as a town resident frustrated him.
 He said, however, he endorsed finding efficiencies and only charging village residents for their water and sewer services through new districts, as opposed to having the entire town help foot the bills.
 “If I lived in the village, I would vote in favor,” he said. “I think the planning was well done. I’d vote for it. I just wished we would get something.”
 The state will provide financial support to the town in the form of a Citizens Empowerment Tax Credit each year in perpetuity if the village dissolves.
 The committee predicted that the credit would be $55,510. It recommends that the town use the funds toward reducing town property taxes, which was used in part to determine how dissolution would affect town taxpayers.
 The committee will meet again March 25 to determine whether to revise any aspect of the draft alternatives report based on feedback before it becomes final.
 Ms. Carter also said the committee will determine whether to recommend a village dissolution.
 “I think we had a very nice turnout,” she said, adding that not many people asked for changes to the report. “We didn’t get a whole lot of feedback.”

Goals from Cristiano Biraghi and Romelu Lukaku earned Inter a 2-1 victory at an empty San Siro after Cauly opened the scoring for Ludogorets, which trailed 2-0 from the first leg.
 Fears over the coronavirus outbreak in Italy meant supporters were not allowed to attend the match and Inter manager Conte admitted the tie had an eerie feel to it.
 "I've also played behind closed doors with Italy against Croatia," he told _Sky Sport Italia_. "The atmosphere is strange and doesn't make things easy as it's like a training session.
 "I have to say that my players took the right approach today, even if we fell behind. We made changes, giving other players some minutes, and now we move on."
 Inter's home league clash with Sampdoria last weekend was postponed in wake of the virus spreading, while the blockbuster trip to Serie A leader Juventus will also be behind closed doors in Turin.
 Conte's Nerazzurri lost their last league match 2-1 to second-placed Lazio and trail Juve by six points with a game in hand to play.
 Conte admitted the Derby d'Italia clash, as well as an the upcoming trip to Napoli, will go a long way to determining just how close his side are to seriously challenging for silverware.
 "We started this run of games and there is an important match coming up against Juventus," he said.  "Once we reach the end of this period, we'll understand how distant we are from a winning level.
 "I am convinced this will give us more clarity on where we are now, the length of the road ahead of us and the work that still needs to be done."
 Inter started with a back three against Ludogorets but reverted to a flat-back four in the second half, with Christian Eriksen and Marcelo Brozovic linking up in central midfield.
 "We need to work on the ideas and have had time in training," Conte said. "The postponement of the game with Sampdoria last week gave us time to test out something new, which can be used either at the start of a match or during the 90 minutes.
 "When you have two strikers, it's inevitably harder work for the midfielders. For those who play with one centre-forward, two wingers or a trequartista, there are more players ready to help cover defensively. We always need to find the right balance depending on the characteristics of the opponents we are up against."
