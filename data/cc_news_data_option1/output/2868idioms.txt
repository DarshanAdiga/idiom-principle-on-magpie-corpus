However, Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that he was unimpressed by the plan by Republicans beginning to take shape.
 "It appears that the developing Republican proposal is really unlikely to meet the moment," Schumer said.
 Meanwhile, President Trump has continued to press for a payroll tax cut, an idea which has largely been dismissed by Senate Republicans. GOP Senator John Thune told reporters on Monday that he believed a payroll tax cut could be in the "first draft" of Republican legislation, but said "there are a lot of Republicans who don't like it for a lot of different reasons." Republican Senator John Cornyn told reporters Monday that he found the idea of a payroll tax cut "problematic."
 A major sticking point for Republicans is whether and how to extend a provision included in an earlier coronavirus relief bill which provided an additional $600 per week in unemployment insurance. The measure was deemed necessary as millions of Americans have lost their jobs in recent months. However, some Republicans argue that extending the provision, which is set to expire at the end of July, may incentivize unemployed Americans to stay out of work, as they may be making more in unemployment insurance than they did at their old jobs.
 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Republicans would like to extend the unemployment benefits in a different form to avoid disincentivizing a return to work.
 Congress passed a flurry of legislation to respond to the pandemic earlier in the spring, including a $2 trillion relief package. However, bipartisan sentiment stalled as the months wore on, even as the number of cases in the U.S. has continued to surge.

WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) — A financially strapped hospital in West Virginia announced unspecified staff reductions Tuesday, the latest in a series of medical center cutbacks in the state over the past year. Wheeling Hospital said in a statement that employees will have until Aug. 4 to decide whether to participate in a severance plan. Further reductions may occur if the goal is not met. The 223-bed hospital is owned by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston and has a medical staff of nearly 300. CEO Douglass Harrison said Wheeling Hospital suffered an $11 million loss in fiscal 2019 and has lost more than $18 million this fiscal year. “We are hopeful that by acting now, we are assuring that the hospital continues to maintain its viability and clinical excellence to meet the ongoing needs of the community in the future,” he said. The hospital said it has already implemented other cost-cutting moves such as pay reductions for administrative staff and physicians, a short-term elimination of retirement matching funds and capital spending reductions. The statement said the hospital also is preparing for a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The hospital is facing a federal lawsuit accusing it of defrauding Medicare and Medicaid of millions of dollars through improperly issued payments and kickbacks to physicians since 2008. Harrison said the hospital is continuing to look for a long-term strategic partner for its ultimate survival. Another Wheeling hospital, Ohio Valley Medical Center, closed last fall along with a sister hospital in nearby Martins Ferry, Ohio. The owner of those hospitals, Alecto Healthcare, also closed a hospital in Fairmont in March. The West Virginia University Health System reopened portions of Fairmont Medical...

The next part of the story might make you cry, too. But in the annals of human-wildlife conflicts, it’s a Cinderella tale.
 The incident that brought the moose calf from Alaska to Colorado could have been a tragic accident of an altogether different kind.
 In May, a hiker in an Anchorage park rounded a bend in a trail and surprised a moose cow and her newborn calf. The mother moose instinctively acted to protect her offspring; the hiker, who was carrying a firearm, to protect his life.
 “Encounters with wildlife are not uncommon here, especially in the urban areas. We have a lot of moose in the state of Alaska, and our population is very outdoorsy,” said Rick Green, special assistant to the commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
 Alces alces gigas, the Alaska Yukon, or Canada, moose is up to a third larger than the subspecies found in Colorado, and adult males can weigh a ton. There are about 250,000 spread across a state the size of Texas and Oklahoma combined, and the 300,000 residents of Alaska’s largest city, Anchorage, share a municipality with as many as 1,500 in the winter.
 “I used to run quite a bit. As I’m running down the street, someone will usually stop and say, you got a moose half a block ahead of you, be aware. They’re massive animals, but what the moose is doing is sitting in a yard, chewing on a tree,” Green said. “Moose in general are pretty docile, until you hit their trigger. I would rather run into a grizzly bear in the wild than a moose, if they’re being aggressive.”
 When Alaska Fish & Game is alerted to the death of a moose, or any wild animal, believed to have been nursing, investigators in the field search for missing young, which usually aren’t hard to find, said Green. For the first few months of its life, a baby moose lacks an enzyme that allows it to digest food, so relies on its mother’s milk. Even in the absence of other threats, it can't survive without her.
 If biologists have reason to believe the mother moose may return, they allow a few days for a reunion. If that doesn’t happen, sometimes another cow will accept the calf in a kind of wildlife foster scenario.
 “Our policy is to have moose calves raised by moose mamas. That’s what we try to do,” Green said.
 It’s policy, if not ethical mandate, in most states — including Colorado. Orphaned, but otherwise healthy animals here, such as the bear cubs rescued last week after their mother acted aggressively toward several people in Manitou Springs and was euthanized, are sent to a rehabilitation facility, with hopes they can be released back into the wild someday.

That doesn’t mean the family home remains unchanged. Not at all. Retirees who love their homes also tend to love making their homes even better – more functional, attractive, comfortable, and versatile. In fact, half of all home renovation expenditures – over $117 billion annually – are made by people over age 55 (and half of that is by those over age 65). Upgrading kitchens and bathrooms may be the first improvements that come to mind; however, the most common renovation is creating a home office (see the chart). That makes sense given how many retirees choose to work, even start businesses, in retirement.

NEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) - A new study conducted by pathologists with LSU Health New Orleans shows that the impacts of the coronavirus on the human heart may be less severe than first thought. “We looked at 22 hearts from cases at LSU and at UMC -NO and what we found was there was no significant inflammation associated with the hearts,” said leading researcher Dr. Richard Vander Heide, who says those findings fly in the face of the way other viruses impact the heart and were somewhat surprising. “Because a lot of the initial studies came out of China earlier this year and suggested that there was a lot of miocarditis and primary heart disease associated with the virus,” he said. Myocarditis is an inflamed heart condition often attributed to a virus, which The mayo clinic says can affect your hearts ability to pump. But researchers did find that the disease may kill heart muscle cells, called myocytes. “What we found was there were individual myocytes that were dying but there was no large areas of inflammation or large areas of cell death,” said Vander Heide. The study also found that most of the coronavirus damage is being caused to patient respiratory systems. “They are dying from hypoxic respiratory failure and not from the cardiac complications,” said Vander Heide. Dr. Vander Heide says the new study could provide guidance to doctors now on the front lines in the fight against coronavirus.' Researchers say The study could guide doctors to focus elsewhere when biomarkers, called cardiac enzymes, which often indicate heart problems, appear. “When patients present initially they show small increases in cardiac enzymes and this is not something that needs to be treated aggressively,” said Vander Heide. While Lsu researchers say the new study is eye-opening, they say more research is needed. “We are continuing to build on our database.” said Vander Heide. Data which doctors hope will be useful in providing more effective coronavirus treatment in the future. The study was conducted on 22 patients who died of Covid-19 at UMC. The majority were African-American. They ranged in age from 44 to 79 years old at the time of their deaths.Copyright 2020 WVUE. All rights reserved.

"Something precious is lost if we rush headlong into the details of life without pausing for a moment to pay homage to the mystery of life and the gift of another day." (Kent Nerburn)  
 Life as we know it has changed, our priorities, our routines and the activities or events we are involved in, are not the same as they were last year. Nonetheless, we have the choice as to how we meet each morning, with a smile and positive energy or not. Sometimes, I just need to pause and be aware of the sights, sounds, and smells around me, they can be the catalyst I need to savor the blessings I have. Everything I read about how to cope with the challenges of these times talks about using gratitude as a tool to guide my mindset. An email that came through this week talked about surrounding ourselves with people who were inspired, excited and grateful. I hope we can each find individuals who may play that role in our lives. In turn, I'm suspecting my outlook will change as well.  
 This reminds me to practice mindfulness, to enjoy the present and absorb the sights and sounds around me. Another life balance is to remember how I use my time. This means I learn and practice techniques that help make time for the things that are really important to me and efficiently get the tasks done so I can relax and enjoy the present, without guilt or resentment. Following are some suggestions that have been helpful to me, I hope some may be helpful to you as well.  
 Sleep is essential to be effective, so remember giving up on sleep may not be the best way to increase productivity. Our bodies and minds need time to reorganize and rejuvenate so make getting 7-8 hours of sleep a priority to operate at my prime and reduce my overall stress levels.  
 Most of us have "to-do" lists and while they serve as a reminder of looming deadlines they may not take into account what is really important to me. My priorities may change if I plan to have a list of top three or four things to accomplish for the day. Break down the larger items into smaller tasks and set deadlines so I can sense fulfillment when I "check it off the list". At the end of the day, identify another top three or four that can be tackled the next day from your big list. This helps to create focus and motivation.  
 Know yourself and your key work time. I know for me, mornings are the best for writing, creating and thinking through issues. Afternoons are for those items on the list that are routine and evenings, well let's just say I turn into a pumpkin early. What time is best for you to work on the top three or four?  
 Be aware of how much time is spent with technology and social media. The more time spent online with non-work related topics, the more difficult it may be to get to the tasks at hand. Try limiting so much time to this and reward yourself in other ways like family activity or reading a book. Also remember some research indicated prolonged usage of Facebook can negatively impact one's self-esteem and then getting things done seems much harder. The suggestion is to allow yourself 10 minutes then turn your attention to the things that really matter.  
 Another technique suggested is to be more organized, "a place for everything and everything in its place". This will forever be a technique I struggle with, but I love the feeling when it's practiced. What can you do to identify areas to organize that will make life easier? What can you do to help family members work on this area so a life skill will be in place for their future work habits? Get rid of clutter and develop a system that works for you.  
 While this list could continue, I hope it's a gentle reminder that life is precious; it's a gift for the day. There will always be things to do, tasks to accomplish and obligations to meet. May we all learn and practice techniques to live productive lives but also enjoy the blessings of the journey.

BURTON, Mich. • Crystal and Chris Martin put off some payments on their home in this blue-collar town near Flint and are pinching pennies to make ends meet until they return to work. In Windsor, Conn., Anne Druce's family canceled home improvement projects out of an abundance of caution but remains financially secure.
 As the coronavirus pandemic drags on, a new poll finds it is having different effects on Americans’ economic well-being. For some, the virus has meant lost income or struggles to pay bills on time — particularly among Hispanic, Black and younger Americans. Others, most notably college-educated and older Americans, have transitioned to working from home or have experienced the nation’s economic decline through a dip in the value of their investments.
 “It’s just all been kind of frustrating,” said Crystal Martin, who lost her job managing a roller skating rink in March and waited 10 weeks for her first unemployment check. Her husband, an X-ray technician at a Flint hospital, was laid off for about month, then took parental leave after Crystal had a baby in July, to reduce the chances of bringing home the virus.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The Idaho Land Board on Tuesday decided to look into building a prison as a possible investment with $130 million it has accumulated through the sale of commercial and residential properties. The five-member board that includes Republican Gov. Brad Little and four other statewide elected officials voted 5-0 to direct the Idaho Department of Lands to look into the feasibility of building the prison and leasing it to the state. Attorney General Lawrence Wasden pitched the idea and said the prison could provide a steady stream of income. The Land Board manages nearly 4,000 square miles (10,300 square kilometers) Idaho received at statehood to benefit mainly public schools. The board is constitutionally mandated to manage that land, as well as market investments, currently worth about $2.5 billion, to get the greatest long-term return. The Land Board last fiscal year generated about $85 million for distribution. In recent years the board has been selling commercial and residential properties amid concerns the state with commercial properties was competing with private businesses and that it wasn't getting a fair return on its residential properties. The result has been a financial windfall with about $240 million anticipated when all the sales are final. The balance is currently about $130 million. But the money must be spent before it automatically transfers into another fund that is not available for land or building purchases. A financial advisor recommended the board reinvest the $240 million in timberland and farmland as a way to buffer the Land Board’s other investments tied to the stock market. The Land Board has followed that advice but come under fire from timber companies who complain they can’t compete with the state in purchasing...

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday approved President Donald Trump's choice of Judy Shelton for the Federal Reserve board of governors on a party-line vote, overcoming widespread questions about her qualifications for the Fed.Committee Chairman Sen. Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said that Shelton had reassured him and other GOP senators that she recognizes the Federal Reserve's independence from the rest of the government and also supports insuring bank deposits — widely accepted policies that she had previously questioned.Crapo also noted Shelton's comments during a February hearing that she does not support returning to the gold standard, in which the value of the dollar is tied to gold, even though she had advocated doing so in the past. Instead, Crapo said, Shelton regards the gold standard as a topic worthy of study.“Many have tried to characterize her views on the gold standard ... as outside the mainstream and disqualifying for this position,” Crapo said. “I strongly disagree with that characterization.”The committee also voted to back the nomination of Christopher Waller, the research director at the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, to fill a final open seat on the Fed's board of governors. Waller was approved 18 to 7, with all dissenting votes from Democrats.Sen. Sherrod Brown from Ohio, the top Democrat on the committee, said Shelton has flip-flopped on many of her positions to align them with Trump. For example, Shelton criticized the Fed for holding short-term interest rates at nearly zero under President Barack Obama, but now supports very low rates, as Trump has urged. Shelton has also long supported free trade and even called for a North American currency union.“She was an interest rate hawk and opposed tariffs on China – but now that President Trump doesn’t like those things, magically, neither does she,” Brown said.Shelton’s unorthodox views and questionable credentials drew broad opposition among economists and many&nbsp;former Fed officials. In a Wall Street Journal editorial in 2009,&nbsp;she wrote, “Let’s return to the gold standard.”A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not comment on when the full Senate would take up the nominations of Shelton and Waller. The vote could take place any time this year, including after the November election.Shelton's approval by the Banking committee represents a turnaround from February, when several senators expressed reservations about her after a hearing.One of them, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, said he was bothered by “some of your writings.” Another, Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, criticized her view that the Fed should cheapen the dollar if other nations appeared to be manipulating their own currencies. After the hearing, Kennedy expressed skepticism about her nomination.Kennedy had grilled Shelton on how she would respond to a recession if she were able to unilaterally set Fed policy. Shelton replied that she would cut the central bank’s benchmark short-term interest rate to zero and start buying $80 billion a month in Treasury bond purchases — policies that she had denounced when the Fed pursued them after the Great Recession.But Shelton’s prospects eventually brightened. Toomey said he would support Shelton after she had reassured him that she would not seek to lower the value of the dollar. Shelby said that if all other Republicans supported her nomination, he wouldn’t block it.Most mainstream economists regard any return to a gold standard as reckless, arguing that it would cause more and deeper recessions by limiting the Fed’s ability to cut interest rates to fight downturns. At a&nbsp;hearing in February, Shelton retreated from her previous stance and said she “would not advocate going back to a prior historical monetary arrangement.”As a member of the Fed's powerful board of governors, Shelton would vote on the Fed's rate decisions and on banking regulation. The governors also vote on whether to institute emergency measures, such as the Fed's decision in March to start&nbsp;buying corporate bonds&nbsp;for the first time.Many of Shelton's critics fear that if she is confirmed as a central bank governor and Trump is re-elected, the president could tap her to succeed Jerome Powell as chair when Powell's chairmanship ends in 2022.David Wilcox, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former director of research and statistics at the Fed, noted that even as a lone governor, Shelton could potentially slow the Fed's decision- making.“Time and energy would be consumed batting away ... proposals that were consigned to the dustbin of history decades ago,” Wilcox said.Some analysts say that the perception that Trump appears less likely to win re-election may boost Shelton's prospects because it makes it less likely that he could elevate her to the Fed's chairmanship. The full Senate could even wait until after the election is over to vote on her nomination.Since Shelton's hearing in February, the coronavirus pandemic has plunged the U.S. economy into its worst downturn since the Depression. Democrats on the Banking Committee have asked the panel's chairman, Michael Crapo, an Idaho Republican, for a second hearing given the drastic deterioration in the economy since the February session.Shelton served as an economic adviser to Trump’s transition team and then as U.S. executive director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which helps former communist countries transition to market economies. She holds a Ph.D. in business administration from the University of Utah.In addition to Shelton, Trump has nominated Christopher Waller, research director at the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, for a second vacancy on the seven-member Fed board. Waller, who drew much less attention at the same February hearing where Shelton appeared, is seen as a far more conventional and qualified choice for the Fed. Some of his research examines the benefits of the central bank’s independence from political interference.Waller has attended the Federal Reserve’s policy meetings for several years as a staffer. Before joining the St. Louis Fed, he worked as an academic, researching monetary policy, for 25 years.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The FBI launched its latest case against him in 2018, federal court records show, when a “brave” individual came forward.It is the second time they have investigated him, court records show. They looked into allegations in 2004 that Householder and his aides took kickbacks from vendors and traded legislation for campaign contributions. Householder left office in 2004 when he was term-limited. The investigation ended in 2006 with no charges filed.State lawmakers and other elected officials expressed dismay and shock at Householder’s arrest.“Today is a sad day. Ohioans deserve to know that their elected officials are working hard every day so that people in our state can have a better life,” said State Rep. Bridget Kelly, D-Cincinnati.State Rep. George Lang, R-West Chester Township said he was “very surprised."“I would encourage everyone not to jump to any conclusions. Don’t pass any judgement until more information is gathered or released, and remember, in the United States, all people are considered innocent until proven guilty.”Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley called for the repeal of House Bill 6.He issued a statement saying:“Those of us who stood up to the culture of corruption in Columbus and opposed the HB6 billion-dollar bailout knew it was terrible for Ohio, but didn’t realize how deep the corruption was! We stood up for clean energy in the middle of a swamp! “Not only did HB6 impose one of the largest tax hikes ever on Ohioans, it repealed Ohio’s renewable clean energy standards—notoriously becoming the only state to ever do so—at a time when renewable energy jobs are the future and a path to better jobs for Ohioans. Of course, the corrupt Columbus politicians put their pocketbooks ahead of our kid’s interests in having a cleaner environment. “In light of the indictments coming out today, I call on the Ohio General Assembly and Governor DeWine to immediately repeal the most crony corrupt bailout bill in the history of our state. And they should re-adopt renewable clean energy standards as the bare minimum first step to disinfect Ohio!”Householder is the second Ohio House speaker to come under federal investigation in as many years.Former Republican Speaker Cliff Rosenberger quit after he was investigated in 2018 by the FBI who looked into his travel and a condo he rented from a wealthy GOP donor.Rosenberger has said he broke no laws and was not charged.

Kenya’s candidate to the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) top post says she is seeking Washington’s backing and expressed some sympathy with its criticism of the global body as she emerges as one of two reform-minded African female frontrunners. Amina Mohamed told Reuters a closed-door vetting session last week went “really well” as she outlined her platform to steer the body out of crises from global trade tensions and rising protectionism to a COVID-induced dive in business. The WTO has never been led by a woman or an African. “The rulebook needs to be upgraded because of the concerns that are being expressed about the rules not being fit for purpose,” she said, adding that resuming the top appeals court would be a priority and that she hoped this would be on the agenda of the next major WTO meeting in 2021.

Baseball is back, but because of the coronavirus, official scorers this season will rule remotely on hits and errors and other plays.
 Perhaps none will be more remote than Jernick, a fixture in the Miami Marlins press box since 1999. He lives three hours north in the Melbourne area.
 MLB is limiting the number of people at the ballpark, including in the press box, and decided official scorers could make their calls without seeing the game in person.
 “There are a lot of roles that have historically been in the ballpark that we had to look at, and the official scorer was a tough one,” said Chris Marinak, MLB executive vice president for strategy, technology and innovation. “When we looked at the job, and the technology available to them, we felt like they can do the entire job they have to do from home."
 Some in baseball are skeptical, although they say they understand health and safety must be the priority.
 Scorers will have access to an unprecedented number of video feeds, accessing the same infrastructure used for replay reviews. When they want to replay a play they can choose their camera angle, and zoom in and rewind.
 But no opportunity to go down to the clubhouse after the game, to talk to the player or a manager for further illumination.
 Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona said the game slows down as an observer gets farther away from the action, which affects judgment on deciding whether a play should be a hit or an error. So he's not keen on scorers working from home.
 “Probably a touch unfair to the official scorer, which could end up affecting the players,” Francona said. "It’s tough enough to be an official scorer when you’re sitting up high. When you get down low and you see actually how fast the ball’s moving or the hops it’s taking or the topspin, you get a much better version of what’s really happening.
 “I know any time you slow it down and watch it again, it always looks like an error. But you have to remember, that player is not allowed to slow it down.”
 Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts agreed.
 “The speed of the game, seeing it in real time with your own eyes in front of you I think matters,” Roberts said.
