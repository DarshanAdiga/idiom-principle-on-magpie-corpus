TAIWAN LEADER TAKES STOCK OF PANDEMIC: Taiwan’s president said the coronavirus pandemic has changed the global political and economic order, accelerated and expanded the reorganization of global supply chains, restructured the global economy, and changed the way we live and shop. In an address Wednesday on her inauguration to a second term, Tsai said such changes present both challenges and opportunities, particularly for Taiwan, which has received praise for its handling of the outbreak even while being excluded from the World Health Organization at the insistence of China. Beijing claims the self-governing democratic island as its own territory. With virus threats still looming, “only those who can end the pandemic within their borders, lay out a strategy for their country’s survival and development, and take advantage of opportunities in the complex world of tomorrow, will be able to set themselves apart on the international stage,” Tsai said. As an aging society, Taiwan needs to bolster disease prevention and treatment capabilities and link industries to make more breakthroughs in vaccine and new drug development, she said.

The board of directors of Aroundtown SA (the 'Company') has resolved today to convene Aroundtown's annual general meeting of shareholders ('AGM') on June 24, 2020. In light of the current market situation and the uncertainties surrounding future macroeconomic developments as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic and international lockdown, the Board of Directors has determined that proposing a dividend distribution to the AGM is not in the Company's best interest at this point in time. The Board of Directors will continue to monitor the market situation and may, if warranted in light of changed conditions, propose a future dividend distribution and corresponding shareholders meeting.

Voted in by his peers just days before the global pandemic brought the sports world to a standstill in March, Tretter said he's solely focused on the health of the league's players, who have remained in virtual contact during an offseason none of them could have imagined.
 Tretter is encouraged that some teams have reopened their facilities, but he acknowledged there's a "long list of hurdles" to be cleared before players can get back together to prepare for a season that remains uncertain and strangely distant.
 The 29-year-old Tretter, who graduated from Cornell with a degree in industrial labor relations, has been deeply involved in discussions ranging from scheduling to players with pre-existing medical conditions and other safety considerations.
 Everything is in play. Nothing is higher on Tretter's checklist than the well- being of players who are facing a ruthless, invisible opponent with an ever- changing game plan.
 Although he's a relative rookie when it comes to football diplomacy, Tretter gave several noncommittal answers Tuesday like a seasoned politician.
 "There's no bad idea at this point, and you kind of have to think outside the box," Tretter said when asked about the potential of players wearing modified face masks with surgical materials. "And just because it's an idea doesn't mean things are definitely going to happen, but you need to explore it, and you need to understand it.
 "You have to focus on fitting football inside of this world of coronavirus and don't get caught up in trying to fit coronavirus inside this world. The way coronavirus has kind of changed how every industry is working, you can't expect just to throw football back in and think that the virus is going to kneel down to almighty football."

The Pentagon is pursuing two main types of hypersonic weapons. One, called a hypersonic glide vehicle, is launched from a rocket. It then glides to a target, maneuvering at high speed to evade interception. The other is sometimes referred to as a hypersonic cruise missile. Capable of being launched from a fighter jet or bomber, it would be powered by a supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, enabling the missile to fly and maneuver at lower altitudes.

Silva has been linked with possible moves to Japan or Major League Soccer but he insists that no decision has been made.
 "Everything is on standby, there’s nothing for now," Silva told AS on Instagram. "My family ask me all the time but my answer is that everything is stopped.
 "I’m back in training again and looking at places where I feel I can be at 100 per cent. Some friends text me with stories saying I’m going to this place or this other place, but they actually know more than me. Honestly, now I’m waiting that we go through all this situation.”
 City fans will be robbed of the opportunity to say goodbye to a player many see as the greatest in the club's history as matches will only restart behind closed doors.
 But while Silva says he has an enormous connection with the supporters, he will not be changing his decision about leaving after a decade with the club.
 “When I say something, I go forward with it. That’s how I feel it," he said. "I’ve had 10 years in Manchester and I’ve accomplished what I wanted to. My era ends here, but I will always have this club in my heart for everything I’ve lived here.
 "From the first moment I’ve been treated in an incredible way. Here in Manchester you are really respected, people show me a lot of adoration. But now my family and myself need another challenge.
 ”To play football, there is a perfect atmosphere. And to live as a footballer too, it’s a calm life over here.
 "The only bad point is the weather but you can actually feel really good here. Those 10 years have even gone very fast now that I look back."

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Oklahoma Democratic Party and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have sued to overturn the state’s absentee voting rules in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, state party Chair Alicia Andrews said Wednesday. Requirements that include notarized ballots and a photo identification create barriers to voters, Andrews said in a statement. “Oklahomans deserve to make their voices heard safely without further barriers to the voting process as we continue to deal with a worldwide pandemic,” Andrews said. “The additional barriers to the mail-in voting process do nothing more than further suppress the votes of marginalized groups and put citizens in harm’s way under the false claims of reducing voter fraud.\" The lawsuit against the state Election Board and Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax comes after a bill signed into law earlier this month imposed the restrictions on absentee ballots. A spokesperson for Ziriax did not immediately return phone calls for comment. The bill was passed and signed days after the state Supreme Court ruled in a lawsuit by the League of Women Voters and two voters at high risk of contracting the coronavirus that mailed- in absentee ballots do not have to be notarized. CORONAVIRUS CASES The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Wednesday reported 5,532 confirmed coroavirus cases and 299 deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, up from 5,489 cases and 294 deaths reported Tuesday, The actual number of those infected is thought to be much higher because many people haven’t been tested and studies suggest people can have the disease without showing symptoms.

If you like any of the following — Hallmark movies, Southern charm, small town drama, heart-swelling romance, or stories about people starting over — you will definitely enjoy Netflix's soapy new series _Sweet Magnolias._ It's the TV equivalent of comfort food and is based on a series of books by Sherryl Woods, whose novels also inspired the popular Hallmark series _Chesapeake Shores_.
 Joanna Garcia Swisher stars as Maddie, a soon-to-be divorced mom of three who is attempting to pick up the pieces of her life after her husband, Bill (Chris Klein, doing a Southern accent and frequently seen sporting khaki shorts), leaves her for Noreen (Jamie Lynn Spears, making her return to TV), the nurse he had an affair with. As Bill prepares to remarry and start a new family, Maddie struggles to deal with the fallout of his very public affair and being in the public eye, raising their kids — the oldest of whom is wrestling with his father's infidelity — and opening a new spa in town with her best friends, Helen (Heather Headley) and Dana Sue (Brooke Elliott). Things start to look up for her, though, when she meets her son's hunky new baseball coach, former Major Leaguer Cal Maddox (Justin Bruening), and sparks begin to fly.

That secured a 26-21 win and the NFC playoffs' No. 1 seed for the Super Bowl-bound 49ers.

The gunbattle, the first in the city in two years, lasted about 12 hours and ended with the killing of Junaid Ashraf Sehrai, a militant commander with Kashmir’s largest rebel group, Hizbul Mujahideen, and his aide. Junaid, son of senior separatist political leader Mohammed Ashraf Sehrai, joined the rebel ranks in early 2018 after graduating in business management from the region’s main university.

We all could use a great comedy about now, but in the absence of that, the fitfully entertaining "The Lovebirds" will do. Booted from its April 3 debut in theaters by the coronavirus, the story of a warring couple stumbling into a night of criminal misadventure has landed unexpectedly on Netflix, one of the few venues where rom-coms still thrive. And this one pulsates courtesy of its fetching leads, Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              They're a mixed-race couple at the end of their romantic rope. What was once cooing has digressed into constant bickering. And at the start of director Michael Showalter's follow-up to the Nanjiani-penned "The Big Sick," Leilani and Jibran mutually agree to go their separate ways. But first, they must maintain appearances by attending a dinner party way down south in New Orleans. Ah, but a funny (well, mildly funny) thing occurs on the way to the soiree involving a bicyclist, a murderous cop and a blackmailed congressman. Suddenly, their love and deep knowledge of each other become essential to their survival.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              There's nothing remotely original on the minds of co-writers Aaron Abrams and Brendan Gali, cribbing generously from other wild-evening-on-the-town flicks like "After Hours," "Game Night" and "Date Night," spiced with a pinch of "Eyes Wide Shut." It's an understatement to say they push the definition of plagiary to Mike Barnicle proportions. And had they not had the fortune to land Rae and Nanjiani, "Lovebirds" probably wouldn't be a night to remember.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              You wouldn't think it, but in action the chemistry between the two comedians emerges a no-brainer. Which is apropos since most of "The Lovebirds" is brain-free. Why, you ask yourself, does love have to be so stupid? Apparently, Rae and Nanjiani asked themselves the same question, as they often override the shallow script by engagingly engaging in movie-saving improvisation. Their timing is impeccable and their delivery sly and subtle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              It doesn't always work, but the stars render you eager to accompany them on a dusk-to-dawn odyssey in which just about everything is thrown at Leilani and Jibran from boiling bacon grease to horrendous dialogue. The strength of both actors is their ability to sell the predictable path in which adversity only makes Leilani and Jibran's threadbare bond grow sturdier. Might they decide to give love a second chance - provided they survive the night? Duh!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Rae and Nanjiani generously give more than they receive from Showalter and the writers, who don't seem to be trying. For most of the blessedly short 85 minutes, little of what transpires makes sense. Nor is it logical, as is the case when the pair makes a confounding stop at an "Eyes Wide Shut" orgy complete with creepy bird masks. If the scene is meant as parody, it's off the mark. And don't get me started on all the shameless plugs for "Mythbusters" and "The Amazing Race," which like the movie's distributor, Paramount, is a wholly owned property of Viacom. Ain't synergy grand?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Despite its faults, "The Lovebirds" is worth your time, simply because Rae and Nanjiani are such delightful company. They're TV's version of comfort food, like chicken gumbo, going down easy in the Big Easy.

International brand and political strategy expert, Eric Schiffer, is claiming truth to widespread rumors involving beloved daytime host, Ellen DeGeneres that allege the talk show host of being a rather unkind person off camera. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, a number of individuals who have worked alongside DeGeneres are now coming forward to speak their side of the story, giving fans of the 62-year-old comedian and television host a much different view of the woman who tells viewers to spread kindness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          While in no affiliation or accord of said claims, PopCulture.com spoke exclusively to Schiffer who alleges DeGeneres has been "inconsistent" with how she wants to be portrayed. "Ellen has been running a giant fraud and positioning herself as a compassionate, sweet celebrity. The facts that are revealed with those behind the scenes in Hollywood and people I know in her circle, show her to be inconsistent with how she wants the public to believe she is," Schiffer told PopCulture. When asked whether he felt there was any truth to the recent rumors spreading among social media, Schiffer said, "I know for a fact, I have very good sources in her inner circle."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The _Finding_ _Dory_ star's former bodyguard, Tom Majercak, described her as "cold" when hired to protect her for the 2014 Oscars, claiming the encounter was just "very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle." According to Schiffer, the pandemic was "the worst thing" that could have happened to the beloved host because "it revealed who she is to the world, first through how she treated her staff and eviscerating them from the payroll of, in most cases, during a time in which people could barely pay the rent if they didn't have a position; and two, many leaked and let the truth out who had been holding back." He further added how DeGeneres is "the single biggest phony in the history of modern Hollywood."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          However, despite claims from Majercak and YouTube star Nikkie de Jager also known as "NikkieTutorials," who alleges DeGeneres of being "cold and distant" when she appeared on the popular television show in January, one source came forward to the comedian's defense telling _Us Weekly_ that it would take a "lot more than a bodyguard and a blogger to change how people feel about her." However, Schiffer begs to differ with his own claims.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In light of all the accusations surfacing and being shared among the masses, her ratings have remained unscathed. However, the celebrity brand expert says it's only a matter of time before it does. "I think in time as the public begins to crack the facade everywhere and the average American and others understand that they've been getting bamboozled with the personality that they're seeing, it will erode the emotional connection and thus the ratings," Schiffer explained, adding without hesitancy that this won't be the end of the story and there is "more to come."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "I suspect that you're going to see her star continue to get hammered because of her character choices -- that might get arrested -- but it's going to require her to look in the mirror and decide to humble herself," Schiffer said. "And she's got, from all the insiders I know, one of the single biggest egos in Hollywood."

The pilot of the app needs at least two stages. First, a group of a few hundred users must verify that the interface works correctly: when the app welcomes or requests an action, the user must understand what to do. In that first phase, bluetooth still does not work. The second stage of the pilot, with thousands of users, already uses a prototype. If the app is to be up and running for the tourist season, the time frames are tight.

Fans have been given encouragement that some Premier League matches will be televised free-to-air after “productive discussions” between the Government and English football authorities. Oliver Dowden, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, believes such a deal could be a &ldquo;win-win situation&rdquo; for supporters and football clubs.Sky and BT Sport have exclusive rights to show live Premier League matches in the UK with the BBC holding a deal for highlights.But with the planned resumption of top- flight football following the coronavirus suspension only possible behind closed doors, talks have been held over widening the television access. Although stressing that the existing broadcast rights have to be respected, Dowden believes the absence of a Saturday afternoon blackout, which is enforced between 2.45 and 5.15 during the regular season, can provide some &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;.&ldquo;I think that creates an opportunity for us to be able to get some sport, some Premier League free to air,&rdquo; Dowden added at the UK Government&rsquo;s daily coronavirus briefing.&ldquo;Those discussions are ongoing. I am having productive discussions – a couple of weeks ago and now the latest ones with Premier League, the EFL and the FA.&ldquo;I hope we can sort this out and also hope we can get more money going into the sport of football. I think we can find ourselves in a win-win situation.&rdquo;

Greenlaw plans on bringing his offseason training within the next two weeks to the 49ers facility, which has been closed since mid-March but is available to prescribed players in need of rehabilitation or treatment. Otherwise, NFL facilities are off limits to coaches and non-rehabilitating players until the green light is given league-wide, and, of course, from local health officials.

To create the life Vance saw for himself it required him to literally take greater than normal risk, in absolute, in every aspect of his life and he's been doing it since his childhood days. Having done jobs since the age of 9 like fixing computers, mowing lawns and helping operate a food truck, he realized that despite all the hard work, his earnings were dismal. In high- school he bought and sold sneakers really honing his marketing and sales skills. By 2016, his second semester in college, he founded his digital marketing agency and went on to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration in Marketing from Texas Tech University. Vance has always been an entrepreneur at heart.

Connellsville is one of three teams, along with Bethel Park and Peters Township, to go from 6A to 5A where they will play in Section 4 along with Albert Gallatin, Thomas Jefferson and Trinity.

“We didn’t truly start conceptualizing this until August 2018,” he said. “So, putting together 16 teams was amazing and the fun everyone had, the results and the monetary dollars that went to the city, everyone was excited.

"We would've liked to have seen how far that could have taken us."
 Rochard led Division I in wins and strikeouts and tied for the Division I lead in shutouts (seven).
 Rochard, who already stymied hitters with her riseball and change-up, became more comfortable throwing her dropball this year.
 "Nobody [as a hitter] can stay on one pitch," she said. "I can throw you all drops in one at-bat and then the next at-bat I can you all rises. And then I can throw a change-up in the mix."
 When Softball America unveiled its rankings of the nation's top 100 players at season's end, the website rated Rochard No. 14.
 Two other Hokies also made the list. Third baseman Kelsey Bennett, who hit .368 this year, checked in at No. 71. Right fielder Jayme Bailey (.385) was No. 81.
 Other regulars of note set to return include Meredith Slaw (.409), Kelsey Brown (.378), Maddi Banks (.340) and Mackenzie Lawter (.340).
 Lattin is the one regular who will not be back.
 The NCAA Division I Council decided in late March to give Division I spring- sports athletes another year of eligibility to make up for the early end to their seasons.
 But D'Amour said Lattin, a fifth-year senior who started at second base, has decided not to use her extra year. Lattin, who hit .212 this year, graduated this month.
 "The … part that stings the most … is losing Liv," Rochard said. "She was the best role model."
 D'Amour said he would have made it work with his scholarship budget if Lattin had wanted to return.
 Michigan transfer Morgan Overaitis could succeed Lattin at second base. She announced in late April that she was transferring to Tech. She hit .277 as a sophomore this year, when she played in 20 games and started 14.
 D'Amour signed six recruits last fall.
 Cameron Fagan, a shortstop from a Florida high school, is the daughter of former San Francisco 49ers defensive end Kevin Fagan. Two of her sisters played softball for Arkansas. Another sister, Sami, is a Tech graduate assistant who played for Missouri.
 "I'm excited to have her," D'Amour said.
 Another signee of note is Emma Ritter, an outfielder from a Maryland high school.
 "She will probably be one of the fastest kids on our team next year," D'Amour said.
 The class also includes pitcher Mac Osborne, who led Richlands to the Class 2 state title last year.
 "I've seen her strike a lot of kids out," D'Amour said.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The leader of one of Louisiana's largest suburban school systems was chosen Wednesday as the state's new education superintendent, defeating the business-backed candidate in a last-minute decision from the state's top school board. Jefferson Parish Schools Superintendent Cade Brumley won the second vote taken by the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education after board members deadlocked on the first vote. Brumley received the backing of Gov. John Bel Edwards' three appointees to the board, along with five elected members, including board President Sandy Holloway. Two-thirds of the 11-member board must agree to hire a superintendent. Brumley received exactly the eight votes needed. He was favored over Jessica Baghian, an assistant state superintendent at the Department of Education who was backed by business organizations and pro- charter school groups, and Lonnie Luce, former superintendent of the St. James Parish school system. In the first round of voting, each of the three nominated contenders received only five votes. Board members took a short recess, then came back for the second vote that selected Brumley. Louisiana’s education superintendent oversees and sets policies governing more than 700,000 public school students across the state. Longtime leader John White resigned as superintendent in March after holding the position since 2012. White received a $275,000 salary. It wasn't immediately clear when Brumley would start in the position. Contract negotiations will decide his start date and salary, according to the education board.

Hamilton, ON, May  20, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rob Cunningham, a spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society, was recently interviewed about vaping on the Rick Howe radio show. The Canadian Vaping Association (CVA) was pleased to find that many of the Cancer Society’s statements were aligned with the CVA’s principles but was disappointed that they still fail to acknowledge vaping as a harm reduction tool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cunningham stated his belief that Canada’s significantly higher increase in youth uptake compared to that of the UK is a direct result of the entrance of Big Tobacco owned vape brands and their aggressive advertising campaigns in the Canadian market. Rob explained that products such as Juul and Vype have nicotine content ranging from 57-59 milligrams per millilitre, which make them both highly addictive and attractive to youth. Prior to the entrance of these products, the European Union had already limited nicotine concentrations to 20 milligrams per millilitre. As a result of this regulation, the appearance of these brands had little effect on youth vaping rates throughout the EU.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The CVA has repeatedly voiced its concern over the high nicotine concentration products sold by Big Tobacco vape brands and the need for a ban on national brand advertising. However, Mr. Cunningham is mistaken in calling for stricter advertising regulations in Canada. Canada has already prohibited advertising vapour products outside of age restricted spaces. As such, further regulations in this regard are no longer necessary nor sensible. Instead, Canada requires consistent reinforcement of the existing regulations. Big Tobacco’s aggressive advertising campaigns only existed because their products entered the market prior to the implementation of these regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Canadian Cancer Society has expressed on multiple occasions that they believe flavoured vapour products should only be sold in age restricted specialty vape shops, a statement the CVA agrees with vehemently. However, the CVA has stated many times that the data from studies conducted by the CDC and Public Health England show that flavours are not the driver for youth uptake. The CVA believes that not only flavoured products, but all nicotine vapour products should be sold in age restricted environments, where staff are equipped to provide the necessary education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       “Vapour products are adult products intended for ex-smokers. The Canadian Cancer Society is absolutely right in advocating for the sale of these products to be limited to age-restricted specialty stores,” said Darryl Tempest, Executive Director of the CVA. “However, they are misinformed in their belief that flavours are a driver for youth uptake. The American Cancer Society’s study proved that removing flavours had no effect on youth vaping rates. This clearly indicates that, if legislation is to be effective in reducing youth vaping, nicotine concentration and access points are the issues that must be addressed,” concluded Tempest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       While the CVA is aligned with many of the Canadian Cancer Society’s views on vaping regulations, it is paramount that our respected health organizations acknowledge that vaping is a far less harmful alternative to smoking. Rob Cunningham has yet to state the benefits of smokers switching to vaping. It is imperative to public health that all health organizations, including the Canadian Cancer Society, embrace all tools available for harm reduction. The research studies are clear - vaping is at least 95% less harmful than smoking and flavours are not the driver for youth uptake.

Jude Law is expecting his sixth child, and his first with his wife Phillipa Coan. On Tuesday, insiders told _The Daily Mail_ that Coan is expecting, just over a year after her marriage to Law last January. Law has five other children from three previous relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Law married Coan last year, and has been open about the possibility of having children ever since. Now, the 32-year-old behavioral psychologist is officially expecting, even stepping out on Sunday with her baby bump on display. Coan and Law, 47, went shopping on Sunday, where Coan wore a tight-fitting black shirt in photos published by _The Daily Mail_. There was no question that she is ready for the world to know about her pregnancy.                                                                                                                                                        __                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "He and Phillipa are blissfully happy together and delighted to add to their family," a source close to Law and Coan said. "Everyone is really excited for the new arrival."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Law had three children during his marriage to actress Sadie Frost in the late 1990s. The two met while filming the movie _Shopping_ , and married in 1997. They divorced in 2003, but still share 23-year-old Rafferty, 19-year-old Iris and 17-year-old Rudy between them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Law did not remarry after his divorce, though he did have a few relationships. However, he did not have more children until 2009, during his relationship with model Samantha Burke. They had a daughter in September of that year, then split up some time later. Finally, in 2015, he had another daughter with girlfriend Catherine Harding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Still, Law's past gave him no hesitation about having another child with Coan. Back in January, when told reporters from The Telegraph asked how he felt about the idea of a baby with Coan, he said: "I love it, so absolutely why not?" He went on to say that the strength of his relationship with Coan gives him lots of confidence about the idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "I'm very lucky to be involved with someone I'm madly in love with... The idea of having more children would be just wonderful. I'm fortunate to be with someone where I'm having more fun than I've ever had in my life. We have an incredibly stable and healthy, wonderful family existence and that involves my kids who are young adults... and then the younger ones are just so much joy and so much fun."

He is also reprising his role as Dr. John Watson in _Sherlock Holmes 3_ , alongside Robert Downey Jr. Both are expected to premiere in 2021, while Law is also rumored to be starring in Francis Ford Coppola's next movie _Megalopolis_.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Before COVID-19 killed thousands of nursing home residents, about 4 in 10 homes inspected were cited for infection control problems, according to a government watchdog report Wednesday that finds a “persistent” pattern of lapses. In light of the pandemic, seemingly minor cutting of corners such as an employee caring for residents while battling a cold has taken on new significance. “Warning signs were ignored and nursing homes were unprepared to face a pandemic,” said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on a committee that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. “There need to be big changes in the way nursing homes care for seniors.” The report from the Government Accountability Office found that state inspectors who help enforce federal nursing home standards classified the overwhelming majority of violations as not severe, generally meaning there was no actual harm to residents. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services carried out enforcement actions for 1% of violations classified as not severe from 2013-2017, the report said. Nursing homes ended up bearing the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak. About 1.4 million people live in some 15,500 facilities in the United States. Most of those people were already at higher risk due to age and medical history, and they also shared dining rooms, recreation areas, bathrooms and sleeping quarters. An ongoing count by The Associated Press has found that outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have killed more than 30,000 people, more than one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the country. The GAO report found that about 40% of the nursing homes inspected in each of the past two years were cited for problems with infection control and prevention. Looking deeper...

DURBAN - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has criticised court action against the government by the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) who say that the National Disaster Management Act gives too much power to Cooperative Governance Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
 The DA also wants government to lift some of its level four lockdown regulations.
 The IFP said that the parties were grandstanding despite government remaining open to consulting with opposition parties.
 IFP president Velenkosini Hlabisa said that instead of politicising government’s approach to COVID-19, the DA and the Freedom Front Plus should consider using availing platforms for consulting government.
 "We do not see the point of going to court if there is a platform for engagement. From the word go, all political parties were involved in the consultation and engagement with government."
 Hlabisa said that the IFP remained in support of government’s efforts, saying that its action had contributed to the country’s encouraging COVID-19 recovery rate, which was now above 40%.
 "We are of the view that the government is still in line with the management of the virus."
 Hlabisa told Eyewitness News that the IFP preferred for the sale of alcohol and cigarettes to only be allowed under level two and one.
 But he said that they were prepared to accept the trade of these items under level three, provided that safety measures were put in place.

The Board of Directors has resolved today to postpone the decision for the distribution of dividends for the financial year 2019. In light of the uncertainties for future macroeconomic developments caused by the Coronavirus pandemic and resulting international lockdowns, the Board of Directors considers it is not in the Company's best interest to propose a distribution of dividends to the AGM at this stage. The Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the market situation and may, if warranted in light of changed conditions, propose a future dividend distribution and accordingly call for another general meeting.

 “I do know how passionately people spoke about people who do have the short- term rental,” Ricci said. “It is helping them pay their taxes here and it is helping them establish their second home here, so that when they’re ready to retire it’s helping them make ends meet."

First there was "The Trip," a six-part, three-hour BBC TV series with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon ... or at least fairly close versions of themselves. The show presented them as friends or, more accurately close acquaintances who, between acting jobs, got a writing assignment to drive through the north of England, hop from hotel to hotel, and eat lunches in fancy restaurants, then report on the experiences. The charm of the whole thing was captured in their conversations, most involving history and pop culture and any topic imaginable practically in between. The charm of that charm was in full flower when the discussions started including impersonations of celebrities - Michael Caine and Sean Connery among them - and an ever-spiraling sense of competition between the two guys over who could do the better one.
 It was a wonderfully entertaining and meandering series of half-hour shows which were eventually edited into the feature film "The Trip." Which begat the series and the movies "The trip to Italy" and "The Trip to Spain," and has now resulted in the fourth and supposedly final installment, "The Trip to Greece." More driving, hotels, restaurants, conversation, and imitations.
 But the shows and films haven't been just a lot of goofiness. In and around all of the talking, viewers have been treated to two spot-on improvisors - and gifted imitators - who are operating with all pistons firing, and are regularly and successfully trying to crack each other up. But there's much more, and credit goes to the creator and director Michael Winterbottom, who has seamlessly instilled a serious side of things, a sense of gravitas, that keeps everything in balance.
 These are comedies, but wrapped up inside them are personal issues that reveal what's making these characters tick. Truth be told, Coogan and Brydon are so good at this sort of thing, it's very difficult to pinpoint where the real people and their characters diverge. In previous entries, there have been looks at the relationship between Coogan and his son (Tim Leach) and the relationship between Brydon and his wife (Rebecca Johnson), and not all has been rosy. In "The Trip to Greece," the thin plotline brings in heartfelt and serious thoughts of mortality.
 But, yes, it's still a comedy, and although Coogan and Brydon present it as a continuation of what they've done before, they make sure to infuse it with a breath of freshness. As does Winterbottom.
 The director chose Greece partially because of the country's beauty, but also because of its history and its myths. The route he puts his protagonists on distantly mirrors the one taken by Odysseus in "The Odyssey." The actors - driving and eating and chattering away - let pieces of their real lives seep into their discussions, and they up the ante in the impressions competition (my favorites include a meeting between Stan Laurel - who Coogan played in the film "Stan & Ollie" - and Tom Hardy, and one involving British actor Ray Winstone if he were to play Henry VIII) and, this time, even get into a physical contest over a swimming challenge.
 As in the previous TV shows and films, there are six lunches, brief peeks - in extreme close-up - of the meals being prepared in restaurant kitchens, and visits by a couple of women from their publication. One of the odder things about all of this is that neither Coogan nor Brydon seem all that knowledgeable about the food they eat or the wine they drink. Or maybe that's just how they're playing the parts. But they certainly come across as an educated, well read pair of travelers with both shared and completely different interests in what they're seeing and talking about.
 If this does turn out to be the final "Trip" film, that'll be too bad, because these have always been a joy to return to. But it also makes sense to end it here, as the Odysseus story is about going on and ending an extended voyage. To be sure, this has been a funny, thoughtful, long, strange one.
 "The Trip to Greece" will be available on cable and digital VOD starting May 22.

The workers are backed by Service Employees International Union, which is trying to unionize fast food restaurants through the Fight for $15 movement. In a lawsuit filed in Chicago this week, and in complaints to state health officials in California, workers say McDonald’s and its franchisees have failed to provide them with adequate masks, gloves and hand sanitizer and haven’t warned them when coworkers test positive for the virus. McDonald’s says the complaints are inaccurate and it has provided franchisees with safety equipment and rules for safe operation.

"I am delighted to continue my journey and adventure at Chelsea," Giroud said in a statement. "I can’t wait to get back to playing and enjoying competitive football with my team-mates. I’m looking forward to wearing the Chelsea shirt again, especially in front of our fans at a full Stamford Bridge, whenever it is safe to do so."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Giroud had been linked with a departure for several months, with the striker nearly moving to Inter in January.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The move to extend Giroud's contract will protect against losing the forward on a free transfer while also giving Chelsea a bit of stability in a market that is sure to be impacted by the coronavirus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Giroud, who scored in Chelsea's final game before the Premier League was suspended due to Covid-19, has featured 13 times this season, scoring three goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  However, his role became more important in the opening weeks of 2020, with Giroud stepping in to replace the injured Tammy Abraham.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Since I have been back at Chelsea, Olivier has been brilliant as a professional and as a man in general," said manager Frank Lampard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "He has great qualities to help the squad both on and off the pitch, not only with his talent but with the example he sets every day and the experience he brings to our young squad. I am very pleased that will continue next season."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The 2018 World Cup winner has made a total of 76 appearances for the club during his stay, finding the back of the net 21 times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  During his Arsenal career, Giroud won three FA Cups and three Community Shields, and the France striker has already claimed an FA Cup and a Europa League title since joining the Blues.

Apparently magnetic eyelashes are a "thing."      I realized this when I started getting a suspicious number of Facebook ads for magnetic false eyelashes. I thought that maybe it was just me and Facebook had determined somehow that I was eyelash-challenged and in desperate need of a solution. But then I found out that my friends were also getting the same ads, so it seemed we were a nation of eyelash-deficient women who could only be saved from this crisis by fake magnetic eyelashes.      In the ads, women applied a magnetic eyeliner on their eyelids which created a magnetic field that attracted a pair of polar opposite eyelashes. This is actually more science than anyone who buys their makeup out of a sale bin at the drugstore needs to know. Supposedly, though, this is a much easier system for applying eyelashes than the old "glue-on and hope you don't glue your eyelids shut" method. I tried the old glue-on method once and the eyelashes came unglued, fell on my cheek, and then someone slapped me because it looked like I had a hairy caterpillar on my face.      After a while, the eyelash ads began to taper off. But then, suddenly, I started getting ads for a fortifying eyelash serum so I could grow out my own pathetic eyelashes and not have the need for magnetic ones. Not wanting to put anything potentially dangerous near my eyes (um, like magnets) I found out that the secret ingredient in this serum was … wait for it … seaweed kelp.      Now my husband had a choice between living with me 24/7 with either hairy caterpillars on my face or smelling like a fresh fish market all the time.      Wanting to make sure that I wasn't missing the boat here, I thought maybe I should check with my husband, the one person who might actually care what my eyelashes looked like and how my face smelled.      "Hey honey," I said. "Do you think I need better eyelashes?"      "Is that a trick question?" he asked. "Like, 'Do these pants make me look fat?'"      "No, I just want to make sure you don't feel let down by my skimpy lashes."      "You have beautiful eyelashes and those pants don't make you look fat," he said. "Am I safe now?"      Clearly, this is not the most important issue on the planet right now, which led me to wonder why someone would think it was so essential for me to have eyelashes of any length at this moment. I'm not going to be batting them at anybody while I'm in isolation. Seriously, who am I going to impress? My dog? He has no opinion on my eyelashes whatsoever. He just wants to know when he's going to be fed, and doesn't care if I have fabulous eyelashes when I serve him his kibble.      With all this attention being paid to my eyelashes, I wondered if this was indicative of a larger beauty problem that had escaped my attention. Honestly, I didn't think I was letting myself go. I still shaved my legs and did my nails and even occasionally put on some makeup when I planned to Facetime with someone and I didn't want to scare their children if they happened to glance at the screen. So, overall, I didn't think I needed magnetic eyelashes or eyelash seaweed serum. What I did need to do was have a talk with customer service at Facebook and tell them they should focus on what's really important.      My eyebrows.

At this point last year, the New England Patriots were gearing up for their NFL offseason workout program. The first day of organized team activities (OTAs) started on May 20. That's when the real fun began.
 It was the start of 10 practices. There was no contact, but the offense vs. defense 11-on-11 drills were a fun prelude to what was to come in August with training camp. It was also when coaches got an idea of the players' skill set after only seeing them in team meetings, the weight room and in individual position drills. It was essentially touch football, but it was fun.
 This year, players are still trying to have fun, but they are strewn across the country chatting via video conferences and working out in homemade gyms. This year, due to the coronavirus pandemic, there are no practices or coaching sessions in person. Instead, the Patriots have been holding virtual meetings.
 Cornerback Jonathan Jones said on Tuesday that they're missing that individual work in OTAs, but it's been good to get the group back together -- even if it's only online.
 "It's been fun. It's definitely been a change-up," Jones said. "The rookies just joined us. Just having that camaraderie, everyone getting to talk and spend time with each together -- it's a little different but as with everything, you learn to adapt and it's been fun just to get back with the guys and have the jokes going back and forth across the meetings as well as getting back to talking ball at an elite level with the coaches and everyone."
 Earlier this offseason, the NFL and NFLPA had reached an agreement to start a voluntary offseason program on April 20. This has been virtual only with players not being able to go to the facilities. These sessions consist of three consecutive weeks of classroom instruction, workouts and non-football educational programs all held using videoconferencing technology.
 With the Patriots, Jones says these meetings have been all about communication. The goal is to get all players "on the same mental plain." That starts with the playbook. For veterans, this time serves as a refresher as coaches talk "terminologies over and over again." Simply put, they're starting from scratch. This is valuable for the veteran newcomers and rookies alike.
 It's a process that the Patriots go through every single offseason. So in a sense, it's not a big change except that everyone is on computers and not inside Gillette Stadium.
 "We don't assume that everyone knows anything so we start on the playbook from page one," Jones said. "Having these meetings and starting from page one of the playbook, go through that as veterans for refreshers and for young guys, to catch them up to where everyone else is. The communication to that is so key."
 Physically, players have had some help in order to stay in shape. All teams are permitted to send players workout equipment and monitoring devices. These include things like kettle bells, resistance bands and Apple watches. The NFL and NFLPA agreed that teams should cover the cost of equipment so that it doesn't cost any player more than $1,500 to transform his house or apartment into a personal gym.
 Patriots trainers have been in contact with all players. They send each player their individual workout based on the equipment they have or was sent to them. Jones said he had a good time assembling his own home gym. As far as staying in shape, he feels like he's staying the course with his normal routine. Of course, the biggest thing missing is the competition.
 "I would say the lack of competition … as far as timing when we're going against the offense in live situations, I think that's the only thing that's missing," Jones said. "As far as workouts and conditioning, we're doing the same regime we'd be doing while we're there. I don't think that's changed much. The live work we'd be getting going into Phase Two of the OTAs is kind of what you're going to miss the most."
 Once teams can get back together, Jones thinks it won't be hard for the Patriots secondary to jell as all cornerbacks and most safeties are back from a year ago. Jones said the communication that they're building in these virtual meetings will help.
 "I think that'll be an extreme advantage for us," Jones said. "We have to stay on the same page."

"A lot of what I found is people say, 'Well I didn't get to really start my career or get that dream job that I really wanted to until three or four years after I graduated.'"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Leslie lost her summer internship with a real estate company that she had hoped would be a springboard into the FinTech world, so she is one of those searching for Plan B, or C or D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Some employers have been able to honor job and internship offers, and some colleges are stepping up their efforts too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In Maine, small liberal arts Colby College launched a "Pay It Northward" program, promising to find jobs for all 500 new graduates, with the help of the school's alumni.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "I get it, it's a tough market out there," said Colby President Dave Greene. They decided to ask alums and more prominent "super alums" to network and help out. "It was really a driving force to see, how do we get these students to graduate and be on their very best foot forward."

Mr Jones said that the patrol vehicle could not catch up with McCormick's Transporter van as it weaved in and out of traffic.
 Mr Jones said that McCormick mounted the central reservation on Edge Lane, but was then blocked in by another car on a nearby road.
 McCormick, who was banned from driving at the time of the incident, fled the scene on foot.
 Mr Jones said: "Police found a prescription at the scene, with his name and address on."

In light of the pandemic, seemingly minor cutting of corners such as an employee caring for residents while battling a cold has taken on new significance.

Stephen Ellis filed an appeal in a lawsuit he lost to four previous serving mayors regarding a tax increment district Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          If the appeal is successful in the Oklahoma Supreme Court, a petition to rescind a council approved amended agreement to a 13-year-old TIF district will be overturned. The city renegotiated with developers in the University North Park TIF district to end the diversion of sales tax revenue retroactively as of June 30.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          About $300,000 a month from July 1, 2019, would then go to city coffers and help fill a $5 million budget shortfall in the current and next fiscal year, which begins June 30. The city has based its fiscal year budget on the hope that the petition appeal will fail, but if it succeeds, the city will enforce budget cuts. Those cuts include tapping into the emergency and rainy day funds and cutting everything from fireworks to mosquito and weed control.

Their hijinks are all a bit too random to fully get on board with the journey, and if you stop for a moment to actually think about what is happening and why, the whole thing might just unravel before you. Rae and Nanjiani make the ride fun enough with their easy chemistry and silly, wide-eyed panic at everything they’re witnessing. Still, “The Lovebirds” lacks the singularity of its stars’ other noteworthy roles.
 You could do a lot worse for a Friday night watch, though and will surely get a few chuckles out of it. And don’t worry, Leilani does find a pair of sneakers eventually.
 “The Lovebirds,” a Netflix release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for “for sexual content, language throughout and some violence.” Running time: 86 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

Inmates have also spent more than two months wondering what will happen once the virus gets behind bars but received little information from correctional officials, Jackson, with the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition, said.

Edwards mirrored that sentiment, but added mobile banking has been on the rise for years.
 “The pandemic highlighted the digital expansion,” he said. “The role that digital is playing now is that customers can manage their funds and banking all without coming into a branch. That is the biggest highlight now, but customers still have access to their money and can still bank. It makes it especially convenient for customers.”
 Both professionals said digital banking has grown over the past few months since some bank branches closed for in-person services. To avoid waiting in line at the drive-thru ATM, customers are choosing to access their accounts from their pockets.
 “During the pandemic, the use of digital banking has skyrocketed because it is one of the more common options, especially with lobbies closed, though customers can do some banking through drive-thrus,” Edwards explained. “With digital banking, customers are making their deposits through an app and moving to digital wallets. In light of the pandemic and not wanting to touch a pin pad, if your smartphone is established this way, you’re able to wave your phone in front of the pin pad and that attaches your payment through the digital wallet.”

Come M24A-ET avremmo preferito che il Governo avesse pensato invece ad un intervento mirato a tutti gli operatori del settore Leisure in Italia (e quindi anche Ristoranti, Musei, parchi acquatici, ecc.) fornendo a chi ne facesse richiesta un voucher (tipo quello per docenti) di 500 euro (divisibili) da spendere liberamente sul territorio italiano per fini, appunto, turistici. In questo caso i 2,4 miliardi, grazie al moltiplicatore (si stima intorno a 60 euro aggiuntivi rispetto a 100 euro spesi nel settore) avrebbero generato una maggiore ricchezza stimata per oltre 1,5 miliardi di euro.

On 27 March 1875, Jones visited Balfour's house to look at the Music Room which he had been commissioned to decorate. Jones told Balfour that the light from the windows was too harsh, and the walls needed to be panelled using light English oakwood, with an oak ceiling and the softness of candlelight. In the following months, Jones drew up plans of how the oak panelling should be carved ornately by his friend and partner in business William Morris, and how his series of oil paintings would integrate with that panelling.

Both Charles Sumner and William Seward were also strong advocates of uniting America’s destiny with China. Seward and U.S. Consul to Beijing, General Anson Burlingham, worked in tandem with Seward’s son George Frederick Seward (U.S. Consul to Shanghai) to organize the Seward-Burlingham Treaty of 1868 with China, giving China free emigration and travel in America, reciprocal access to education for citizens living in the others’ country, and favored nation status with the United States on trade. While treacherous politicians later annulled this treaty, its existence brought a new generation of Chinese revolutionaries to America including a young student named Sun Yat-sen who would later lead a revolution in 1911, establishing a new Chinese republic upon the Three Principles elaborated first by Abraham Lincoln!

First there was "The Trip," a six-part, three-hour BBC TV series with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon ... or at least fairly close versions of themselves. The show presented them as friends or, more accurately, close acquaintances who, between acting jobs, got a writing assignment to drive through the north of England, hop from hotel to hotel, and eat lunches in fancy restaurants, then report on the experiences. The charm of the whole thing was captured in their conversations, most involving history and pop culture and any topic imaginable practically in between. The charm of that charm was in full flower when the discussions started including impersonations of celebrities - Michael Caine and Sean Connery among them - and an ever-spiraling sense of competition between the two guys over who could do the better one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It was a wonderfully entertaining and meandering series of half-hour shows which were eventually edited into the feature film "The Trip." Which begat the series and the movies "The trip to Italy" and "The Trip to Spain," and has now resulted in the fourth and supposedly final installment, "The Trip to Greece." More driving, hotels, restaurants, conversation and imitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          But the shows and films haven't been just a lot of goofiness. In and around all of the talking, viewers have been treated to two spot-on improvisors - and gifted imitators - who are operating with all pistons firing, and are regularly and successfully trying to crack each other up. But there's much more, and credit goes to the creator and director Michael Winterbottom, who has seamlessly instilled a serious side of things, a sense of gravitas, that keeps everything in balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          These are comedies, but wrapped up inside them are personal issues that reveal what's making these characters tick. Truth be told, Coogan and Brydon are so good at this sort of thing, it's very difficult to pinpoint where the real people and their characters diverge. In previous entries, there have been looks at the relationship between Coogan and his son (Tim Leach) and the relationship between Brydon and his wife (Rebecca Johnson), and not all has been rosy. In "The Trip to Greece," the thin plotline brings in heartfelt and serious thoughts of mortality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          But, yes, it's still a comedy, and although Coogan and Brydon present it as a continuation of what they've done before, they make sure to infuse it with a breath of freshness. As does Winterbottom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The director chose Greece partially because of the country's beauty, but also because of its history and its myths. The route he puts his protagonists on distantly mirrors the one taken by Odysseus in "The Odyssey." The actors - driving and eating and chattering away - let pieces of their real lives seep into their discussions, and they up the ante in the impressions competition (my favorites include a meeting between Stan Laurel - who Coogan played in the film "Stan & Ollie" - and Tom Hardy, and one involving British actor Ray Winstone if he were to play Henry VIII) and, this time, even get into a physical contest over a swimming challenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          As in the previous TV shows and films, there are six lunches, brief peeks - in extreme close-up - of the meals being prepared in restaurant kitchens, and visits by a couple of women from their publication. One of the odder things about all of this is that neither Coogan nor Brydon seem all that knowledgeable about the food they eat or the wine they drink. Or maybe that's just how they're playing the parts. But they certainly come across as an educated, well read pair of travelers with both shared and completely different interests in what they're seeing and talking about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          If this does turn out to be the final "Trip" film, that'll be too bad, because these have always been a joy to return to. But it also makes sense to end it here, as the Odysseus story is about going on and ending an extended voyage. To be sure, this has been a funny, thoughtful, long, strange one.

Health bosses are drawing up contingency plans to enable hospitals in Greater Manchester to return to 'normal business' \- and cope with further waves of coronavirus cases.
 More than 1,700 people have died at Greater Manchester's hospitals having contracting COVID-19.
 Those in charge have been forced to transform the way patients are treated in a bid to keep infection rates down.
 At the start of the outbreak, measures included banning visitors from most sites; cancelling all non-urgent treatment indefinitely; and building a new field hospital - the NHS Nightingale North West.
 As the infection and death rates begins to slow, health bosses are now drawing up plans to resume the day-to-day work of hospitals - around COVID-19.
 It is accepted across the board that the virus is here for the long-term. The days of patients and visitors freely wandering in and out of hospitals appear to be over.
 The Northern Care Alliance (NCA) oversees the work of Salford Royal, Fairfield General, the Royal Oldham Hospital and Rochdale Infirmary.

Shape each dough round like so: “Flip the round so the floured top is now down on the floured work surface. Lightly flour your hands and grab the bottom of the round and stretch it lightly downward towards your body and then up and over about 2/3 the way to the top. Then, grab the left and right sides of the dough and stretch them away from each other, fold one side over toward the other and repeat with the other side. Then, grab the top of the circle and stretch away from your body and fold down to the bottom of the resting dough. You’ll now have a tight package that resembles a letter. Finally, flip, or roll down the dough so the seams are all on the bottom and using two hands cup the top part of the round and drag the dough gently toward your body. The angle of your hands will gently press the bottom of the dough on the counter creating tension, forming a skin on the top of the dough as you drag.”

First there was "The Trip," a six-part, three-hour BBC TV series with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon ... or at least fairly close versions of themselves. The show presented them as friends or, more accurately, close acquaintances who, between acting jobs, got a writing assignment to drive through the north of England, hop from hotel to hotel, and eat lunches in fancy restaurants, then report on the experiences. The charm of the whole thing was captured in their conversations, most involving history and pop culture and any topic imaginable practically in between. The charm of that charm was in full flower when the discussions started including impersonations of celebrities - Michael Caine and Sean Connery among them - and an ever-spiraling sense of competition between the two guys over who could do the better one.      It was a wonderfully entertaining and meandering series of half-hour shows which were eventually edited into the feature film "The Trip." Which begat the series and the movies "The trip to Italy" and "The Trip to Spain," and has now resulted in the fourth and supposedly final installment, "The Trip to Greece." More driving, hotels, restaurants, conversation and imitations.      But the shows and films haven't been just a lot of goofiness. In and around all of the talking, viewers have been treated to two spot-on improvisors - and gifted imitators - who are operating with all pistons firing, and are regularly and successfully trying to crack each other up. But there's much more, and credit goes to the creator and director Michael Winterbottom, who has seamlessly instilled a serious side of things, a sense of gravitas, that keeps everything in balance.      These are comedies, but wrapped up inside them are personal issues that reveal what's making these characters tick. Truth be told, Coogan and Brydon are so good at this sort of thing, it's very difficult to pinpoint where the real people and their characters diverge. In previous entries, there have been looks at the relationship between Coogan and his son (Tim Leach) and the relationship between Brydon and his wife (Rebecca Johnson), and not all has been rosy. In "The Trip to Greece," the thin plotline brings in heartfelt and serious thoughts of mortality.      But, yes, it's still a comedy, and although Coogan and Brydon present it as a continuation of what they've done before, they make sure to infuse it with a breath of freshness. As does Winterbottom.      The director chose Greece partially because of the country's beauty, but also because of its history and its myths. The route he puts his protagonists on distantly mirrors the one taken by Odysseus in "The Odyssey." The actors - driving and eating and chattering away - let pieces of their real lives seep into their discussions, and they up the ante in the impressions competition (my favorites include a meeting between Stan Laurel - who Coogan played in the film "Stan & Ollie" \- and Tom Hardy, and one involving British actor Ray Winstone if he were to play Henry VIII) and, this time, even get into a physical contest over a swimming challenge.      As in the previous TV shows and films, there are six lunches, brief peeks - in extreme close-up - of the meals being prepared in restaurant kitchens, and visits by a couple of women from their publication. One of the odder things about all of this is that neither Coogan nor Brydon seem all that knowledgeable about the food they eat or the wine they drink. Or maybe that's just how they're playing the parts. But they certainly come across as an educated, well read pair of travelers with both shared and completely different interests in what they're seeing and talking about.      If this does turn out to be the final "Trip" film, that'll be too bad, because these have always been a joy to return to. But it also makes sense to end it here, as the Odysseus story is about going on and ending an extended voyage. To be sure, this has been a funny, thoughtful, long, strange one.

Gold is trading 0.30% higher on the session but there could be a lower high in the making. The chart is showing a potential rejection at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the move lower. Fundamental backdrop Once again today (Wednesday) has been a risk-on session as the equities market shrug off reports that the Moderna drug tests have not enough data to go on. There was an initial drop after the news but since all of the US bourses trade over 1.5% higher and in the EU the Dax and the FTSE are also in the black. On Wednesday, after the stock market open the Moderna CEO did comment to say the FDA has given the company the green light to move over to phase two of the clinical tests.Gold has held up pretty well and is higher on the session but the bears are capping the gains at the 61.8% Fib zone which will be spoken about later in the article. From central bankers, the main comments have been from the BoE. Governor Bailey stated that the UK will not rule out negative interest rates and they are looking carefully at the experience of other central banks. They are also looking to review the purchase of risky assets, this to me seems like they might be looking into the corporate debt ETF's like in the US. Broadbent then took over to say that the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis won't feel "v-shaped". Technical picture Looking closer at the 4-hour gold chart you can see the price stopped exactly at the 138.2 Fib extension. Now there has been a subsequent move lower the retracement from this move is struggling at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. This aforementioned level is very close to the USD 1750.00 per troy ounce level and might become an important zone. If the bulls manage to barge through the zone a retest of the highs might be on the cards and if not we could see a deeper correction. The level to watch on the downside is the USD 1722.17 per troy once support. If there is a breach of that zone that would be the confirmation needed for the bears to push harder.

Vance's rags to riches story are genuinely motivating, but he also attributes his ability to adapt to life's every challenge that has helped him make it big. To keep on achieving success, one needs to stay motivated and always be open to learning. Life has many valuable lessons to teach, and only those who keep learning to succeed. As Vance puts it, "It's been constant adaptation, regular collaborations, and continuous investing in myself, in my business and my future with pure focus and 100% conviction that the life of my dreams is attainable."

Chung considered retirement this offseason, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported Wednesday. The Patriots instead signed Chung to a two-year contract extension that lasts through the 2023 season. The move was done with freeing up cap space in mind. The Patriots didn't even have enough cap room to sign top pick Kyle Dugger, a safety out of Lenoir-Rhyne. It would be surprising if Chung plays with the Patriots through the length of his new contract.

"We wanted to know what Kristy was looking for and so we worked from a guideline she was giving us, but we also had scouts all over the country looking for men that may be the right match for Kristy," "Labor of Love" executive producer Spike Van Briesen of Propagate Content told TheWrap. "So that took a long time for us to do. And I think we did a really good job of finding men that absolutely Kristy would want to meet, but then we also had Kristy answer questions about what are some of the things she wasn't thinking about inside a relationship with a man. And she answered those questions and we found those men as well. All of the men who are brought onto the show, they all have careers, they are well-established, they know what they want in life -- but they're not all cut from the same cloth. And I think that gave us great variety for not only Kristy to have different conversations, but for the men to have different conversations with each other."

4. The state legislature, the body that originally granted DHS its powers, challenged Palm’s order, requesting that the Supreme Court decide whether that order was actually an “order” or, instead, a “rule.” Under Wisconsin law, a rule is essentially a law; once issued, it is applicable going forward. By contrast, an order remains in force only during a specific situation. DHS may issue orders unilaterally, but it must work with the legislature to make rules. Although Palm’s attorney and three of seven justices argued that Order 28 was just that, an order, four justices concurred that it was a rule. Thus, they concluded that when the secretary issued it unilaterally, she violated the law. However, Justice Brian Hagedorn cogently argued that Order 28 “is a temporary order issued to address the outbreak of a particular communicable disease” and so “does not meet the definition of a rule.” See Wisconsin Legislature v. Secretary-Designee Andrea Palm, 110–60.

COVID-19 has opened our eyes to a lot of procedures we considered effective only to find out they weren't so effective, at least not for COVID-19. We are finding out that no one thing will control this virus. Hand sanitizer, washing hands, disinfecting, and social distancing when done alone are not very effective, but when you practice doing them all together the effectiveness of controlling this virus increases significantly.
 We all know we can’t stop the virus, but we can limit it and we can develop good preventative measures for today and for any future viruses that may come our way (it’s inevitable there will be more viruses). The key is to not get laxidasical and resort back to bad habits once this threat is over. Keep washing your hands often, and stay home when you're sick.
 You can rest assured our group of custodians are working hard to make sure that buildings are as safe as possible when we all return to the schools. We have disinfected every table, chair and countertop in every room in every building. We have developed a sign-in procedure at every building. This provides us an efficient way to know who’s in the buildings and where they went so we can disinfect every day to ensure a safe environment for staff when they return the next day.
 We have purchased mobile hand sanitizer units for each building so we can have hand sanitizer available where soap and water isn’t readily available. Custodians are checking soap dispensers frequently to make sure they don’t run out. I’ve been attending many virtual Health and Safety meetings happening in my field of work and picking up new and better practices to provide a cleaner building. Those new practices will be implemented in our buildings.
 There is one thing that never changes in my field of work and that is everything can change in the blink of an eye. In my field of work, if you can’t embrace change and be willing to change your plans or practices frequently, you are doing a disservice to your district, staff, and students. My department will continue to strive for better ways of doing things to ensure all our buildings and grounds are presentable, safe, and a great place to work and learn.
 Hopefully this sheds a little light on what we are doing in the custodial world during these crazy times. We, like all of you, are ready to move forward and embrace our new normal.

Somewhere, Michael Thomas is doing ... something.
   
 That's about as much as the New Orleans Saints superstar wideout is willing to divulge about his offseason preparations for the 2020 NFL season.
   
 "Oh, I don't give up my stuff like that," Thomas said.
   
 Though he may be keeping his regimen to himself, he is working. And whenever Thomas is able to return to the field with his teammates, he is confident the work he's putting in will show.
   
 "You'll be able to tell," Thomas said. "Everyone will be able to tell."
   
 Thomas is coming off one of the greatest statistical seasons ever put together by an NFL wide receiver. He established a new single-season record with 149 receptions in 2019 -- pacing the league in receptions for the second consecutive year.
   
 He also led the NFL with 1,725 yards receiving, the seventh-best single-season mark in NFL history.
   
 Thomas ranks second on the NFL's career receptions list for players through their first five seasons -- and he's only played four seasons.
   
 And he said he does not plan on resting on his laurels, even if the coronavirus pandemic has placed restrictions on his usual routine -- whatever that may be.
   
 "I'll be ready when the season comes," Thomas said. "More than ready."
   
 About the only detail Thomas was willing to give up about his offseason training was that he owns a machine that will deliver passes to him. That will have to do until he can link up with Saints quarterbacks Drew Brees, Taysom Hill and Jameis Winston.
   
 In the past, Thomas has spent time with Brees in the offseason, building rapport ahead of the team reporting for training camp.
   
 That hasn't happened yet this year, but again, Thomas is not concerned about any rust potentially building up on his connection with his quarterback. At the end of the day, he said, their on-field relationship is centered around trust, and he doesn't see an extended offseason separation changing that.
   
 "Drew and I have played a lot of football together now," Thomas said. "... So I think with just having that type of relationship, you go and do the work, whether somebody is watching or not, you're still going to find ways to get better. You're still going to find ways to make sure you're doing what Drew's expecting you to do, that's all."
   
 Being on his own has also meant Thomas has not gotten a chance to get to know his newest teammate in the wide receiver group, free agent addition Emmanuel Sanders.
   
 The 33-year-old Sanders signed a two-year contract with the Saints this offseason, giving them a complement to Thomas they have not had for a while. Other than Thomas, no Saints receiver has caught more than 30 passes the last two seasons.
   
 Sanders has averaged 63 catches for 825 yards across the last seven seasons with the Steelers, Broncos and 49ers, making the Pro Bowl twice in that span. He's also played in three Super Bowls.
   
 Thomas said he has not reached out to Sanders yet, but he took care to point out Sanders' championship credentials.
   
 "He's a great vet," Thomas said. "He's played in some big-time games, so he knows what it takes. That was just adding another great piece to the puzzle, and I can't wait to see how it enhances our offense."
   
 As far as how Sanders might help open things up for him? Like the effect of his workouts, Thomas said you're just going to have to wait and see.
   
 "We're going to find out," Thomas said.
   
 Mercedes-Benz declines to renew Superdome rights, opening door to new name next year
   
 In about a year, New Orleanians will have to start getting used to calling the Superdome by a new name.
   
 New Orleans Saints spokesman Greg Bensel confirmed Tuesday that Mercedes-Benz won't renew the naming rights to the Superdome. The end to the agreement with the German carmaker, which is set to expire in July 2021, has set off a search for another sponsor.
   
 "The agreement is not being renewed, based on Mercedes-Benz having other opportunities," Bensel said. "Mercedes-Benz has been an excellent partner for our team, the building and our region. We could not have asked for a more well-respected global company to have as our inaugural naming rights partner."
   
 The search marks just the second time in the Superdome's 45-year history that its naming rights have been up for grabs, and will end an unusual three years in which the Saints and arch-rival Atlanta Falcons both played in stadiums with the same sponsor.
   
 Mercedes-Benz, which has its U.S. corporate headquarters in Atlanta, did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
   
 The stadium opened its doors in 1975 as the Louisiana Superdome, a name that it kept through decades of major events including seven Super Bowls, the annual Essence Festival, concerts and, of course, Saints home games. It has also hosted special events including an address by Pope John Paul II in 1987 and the Republican National Convention the following year.
   
 The building also gained notoriety during Hurricane Katrina, when it was used as a shelter of last resort.
   
 The process of picking a new sponsor will be up to the Saints, and not the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District, the state entity often known as the Superdome Commission that owns the Dome.
   
 Mercedes-Benz became the first company to put its name on the building in 2011 under a 10-year deal with the Saints that was reported to be worth between $50 million and $60 million. That deal came after months of courting by Saints officials, including trips to Germany to sell the idea.
   
 Bensel declined to say how much the Saints believed the naming rights are now worth.

So this request was fortuitous, even if it required the kind of planning his company had never done before.
 "Normally this would take about 12 weeks for us to get into production," he said.
 Olson's company is in the business of die casting, essentially pouring molten aluminum into custom molds to make larger car parts. So to make the kind of small pistons that GM needed would require different kinds of molds — smaller ones. So he called a _different_ company that makes custom molds — Die Tech in Grand Rapids, Mich.
 The two manufacturers pulled in all of their engineers and ran their shops around the clock all weekend long. Some engineers designed the mold. Others ran computer simulations to find the optimal speed for pouring the molten aluminum. Months' worth of man-hours were condensed into a few days.

“We’re very fortunate to have a software system that allows us to work remotely without any issues whatsoever, so it wasn’t a hard transition at all,” said Jacobson, 51 of Bainbridge Township, “Again we’re very fortunate because we pivoted quickly, had the right supply channels locked down and it has been great. If we didn’t pivot, we would’ve survived but there is a good chance that I wouldn’t have been able to bring back my staff. Under no circumstances, it would’ve been incredibly hard times if we had not made that pivot.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Jacobson added that the rest of the promotional products industry may not be singing the same tune.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “There are no events, no meetings, nothing,” he said. “Depending on the type of business you are, you weren’t even allowed to be open. When the businesses do come back, the last thing they’re going to worry about is a promotional marketing spend. It’s going to take the better part of a year or more for this industry to recover. And that is dependent on where COVID-19 takes us. We’re not out of it yet and we may be right back into the thick of it in the near future.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  But at the end of the day, Jacobson said KMK and Pulsar just felt it important to keep the money flowing for their employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “We wanted to be able to help the community, which we did via the donations we’ve made and will continue to make, and at the same time, we’ve been able to stay in business and keep our employees working and fed,” he said. “That was paramount. To be able to be successful at what we’re doing was an absolute bonus.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  KMK Promotional Sales is at 300 Industrial Parkway East.

“On the totem pole of life right now, people are just trying to put food on the table. Until that gets rectified, it’s going to be hard to say how many people are going to actively, consistently keep the tour business open,” he said.
 To slow the spread of the virus, Hawaii Gov. David Ige issued a stay-at-home order in late March and mandated that all travelers adhere to a strict 14-day quarantine when they arrive in the islands. The number of tourists has slowed to a trickle of about 200 per day, down from 30,000 before the pandemic.
 Roland Chang said he supports these moves, given they are so important to protect the elderly who are more vulnerable to the disease.
 “They’re at the higher risk level. Without them, we don’t have a future. So let’s keep them going. Tourism will heal itself,” he said.

The caption simply read: "It's true… #LegallyBlonde3"

At any rate, the "region" idea for 2020 just highlights the advantage teams on the East Coast and in the Midwest have when it comes to travel, particularly when it comes to the AL West. The AL and NL East teams and those in the AL and NL Central have few flights that are more than an hour. The A's and Mariners? No such luck. Reduced travel would be a major plus for both teams, who lead the league in mileage every year without fail.

According to past Transcript articles, 21 people reported injuries statewide, and Glen Irish, 79, and Billy Hutchinson, 76, both of Shawnee, died from the storms. One death occurred at Norman Regional Hospital, where a patient was being treated for critical injuries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When the storms hit, local responders were reminded just how much the help of non-governmental and faith-based organizations matters, said George Mauldin, director of Cleveland County's Emergency Management. Mauldin also was fairly new to the county job in May 2013 and dealt mostly with the May 19 Norman tornado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          While FEMA provides resources for disaster response, the agency isn't necessarily the first on the ground after a storm and may take days or weeks to get aid to an area, Mauldin said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Organizations like The Red Cross, Samaritan's Purse and Salvation Army were especially helpful after the tornadoes, Mauldin said. Samaritan's Purse came in to rebuild eight local homes, while the Red Cross gave money to the county and the City of Norman to construct storm shelters for families impacted by the storms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In the aftermath of the storms, Mauldin said he also witnessed an enormous outpouring of financial support for those organizations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the heavy media coverage of the storms, NGOs received significant donations to support recovery work, Mauldin said. In his decades in emergency response, Mauldin said he's never seen a donation response like the one after the 2013 storms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Stacy and Mauldin said that while things haven't necessarily changed much in local emergency preparedness since 2013, there are always lessons to be learned in disaster response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It's always helpful to have contracts in place before a storm hits to make sure that every aspect of response -- from debris removal to handling FEMA contracts -- is handled by professionals, Stacy said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It also helps to think outside the box beforehand, said Stacy, adding that when the tornado hit parts of west Moore, he and his team found unexpected damage at horse barns and had to be ready to find access to vets and humane animal care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          As a county commissioner, Stacy said his job doesn't end when the initial story clean-up is over. In fact, the county just wrapped up some of its grant-funded projects from 2013 in east Cleveland County about a year and a half ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          While disaster preparedness takes flexibility and a willingness to reach out for help, Stacy said, in the end, "truly everybody does come together."

SARASOTA COUNTY -- Sarasota County commissioners are weighing whether to take action against the plaintiffs of a recently rejected federal redistricting lawsuit in an effort to recover $20,000 in litigation costs.
   
 Wealthy Palmer Ranch developer Hugh Culverhouse, who spearheaded the challenge, called the county's attempt "ridiculous."
   
 Culverhouse, who is also an attorney, had donated his time and a significant amount of money for the lawsuit, which alleged that the county's new district boundaries discriminated against black voters.
   
 If the county decides to pursue the case, the money would be collected from the three plaintiffs of the redistricting lawsuit.
   
 They are former Sarasota city commissioner and County Commission candidate Fredd Atkins, Mary Mack and Michael White. All are residents of the historically black Newtown area. The County Commission pursued the redistricting plan after voters in 2018 approved a county charter amendment requiring commissioners to be elected from voters in their districts, rather than countywide. Under the previous district boundaries, the amendment created a district that would have been favorable for a Democratic candidate.
   
 Newtown was shifted out of District 1 under the redistricting plan. All three plaintiffs were moved into District 2.
   
 Culverhouse said the 8,000 residents moved from District 1 to District 2, who were also plaintiffs in the suit, could be on the hook if the county proceeds and is successful.
   
 "They're considering giving the thumbs up or thumbs down to collect from impoverished black people during the middle of a pandemic and an economy going to the gallows," said Culverhouse. "And for what? You got me."
   
 As the prevailing party, Sarasota County can and typically does seek to recover litigation costs from the plaintiffs who brought lawsuits against it. The recoverable litigation costs in federal court are limited to certain out of pocket expenses directly related to the litigation.
   
 In this case, most of the litigation costs are related to deposition expenses including court reporter fees and deposition transcripts.
   
 The county's trial counsel, Andy Bardos of GrayRobinson law firm, estimated recoverable litigation costs will likely be $20,000.
   
 A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit earlier this month because he concluded that there were no racial motivations for redistricting, which is what the plaintiffs were alleging. But the potential motivations he did cite are still notable because they're illegal in other settings.
   
 "There is simply no record of evidence that the main driver of this was skin color, rather than simple political gerrymandering and 'hardball' partisan incumbent protection," Judge William Jung wrote.
   
 If the board wishes to pursue litigation costs on Wednesday, Bardos will file the paperwork in federal court to obtain a judgment against the plaintiffs for the amount of the recoverable litigation costs.

Three Davidson County-based actors will take to the virtual stage in the online comedy "Lock-In" being released on May 29, at 8 p.m. EDT.
   
 In "Lock-in: A Socially-Distanced Film," local father Jimmy Miller and daughters, Cassie Miller and Kayla Miller, will perform in the Spring Theatre production's fully-online, socially-distanced performance series. In addition, Wendy, wife to Jimmy and mom to Cassie and Kayla, has acted as cinematographer throughout the process, making this a true family affair.
   
 Under the direction of Dan Beckmann and Erinn Dearth, "Lock-in" features vignettes inspired by the real-life stay-at-home mandates that resulted from the pandemic, except that in the movie, people are locked in their houses because of an alien experiment on social distancing.
   
 "The film started as a performance project to provide creative outlets and keep a sense of community during a time of quarantine," Dearth, executive director, said. "But we quickly realized we were a part of something bigger than ourselves."
   
 Performers individually contributed their pieces of the performative puzzle from across the globe, which are then assembled into a theatrical collaboration. The project has 100 participants, including both the next generation of theatrical artists and seasoned thespians. Participants are recording digital footage from 76 different locations across the world from the Triad, Virginia, Florida, Minnesota, New York, England, Australia, and more.
   
 Jimmy Miller and his daughters were cast as "Galaxy Team 0" government agents investigating some unusual events occurring worldwide. Jimmy was active in Friends of the Theater in the early '90s, dropped out of theater to work and raise his family until returning to the stage in 2017 with High Point Community Theatre's production of "My Fair Lady." He has been active in several productions with HPCT since then, including portraying Scrooge in the annual production of "A Christmas Carol" for the past three years. Jimmy is currently employed by CSW, a commercial construction firm in Lexington.
   
 Jimmy Miller said this was the perfect opportunity to return to acting.
   
 "I'm excited to see how the final product comes together. I also look forward to seeing what happens … there have been a lot of discussions about doing some really cool things with it, so who knows where we may ultimately see it shown."
   
 Cassie Miller, a graduate from Foxcroft Academy (homeschool) in 2018, found herself missing theatre during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. She is currently attending Appalachian State University where she is a rising senior, pursuing a degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders with a minor in Dance Studies.
   
 Prior to leaving for college, Cassie was active in local community theatre, having been in more than 18 local productions with both Lexington Youth Theatre and High Point Community Theatre. She has participated in two productions with the Appalachian State Musical Theatre Club since moving to Boone in fall 2018. As colleges across the state make decisions about the fall semester, she said the film was a welcomed distraction from future uncertainty.
   
 "Being home from college meant that everything I was involved with this spring was canceled, so the Digital Performance Project has given me something to focus on other than schoolwork," Cassie said. "Getting to do it with my whole family has made it even more fun and memorable."
   
 Kayla Miller is a senior at Foxcroft Academy and is dual enrolled at Davidson County Community College. Kayla is active in local community theatre productions, having been in over 30 productions since the age of 5. Kayla was in rehearsals for two productions, "Shrek" with Lexington Youth Theatre, and "Matilda" with HPCT when the COVID-19 crisis necessitated the shutdown of all large gatherings. Both productions were rescheduled for fall 2020.
   
 Additionally, there are countless others involved in the film who make up SFX, video, graphics and editing teams. "Lock-In," a feature-length independent comedy film shot at a social distance as a part of Spring Theatre's Digital Performance Project, will be released in its entirety for a live premiere event on the Spring Theatre YouTube page.
   
 "This film is like a big puzzle that each cast member only gets to see their piece of, so I'm really excited to see those pieces all come together in the final product," Kayla Miller said. "I am really looking forward to seeing everyone's individual performances and contributions."

What a return to normal looks like varies widely. In Spain, it’s a new government order to wear masks outside even as some businesses reopen. For people in Connecticut, restaurants are back in business, but for outdoor dining only. For wealthy shoppers, it’s returning to the newly reopened boutiques of Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California.

Birds of a feather don’t always flock together
 The Blue Angels and Air Force Thunderbirds teamed up to honor essential workers with flyovers in Maryland, New York City, Newark and Trenton, New Jersey, and Philadelphia earlier this month. But those who caught a glimpse of the pilots over the Baltimore and Washington D.C. area may not have known they were seeing a rare sight.
 The teams normally do not fly within 150 miles of each other without special permission, according to the Blue Angels website. Department of Defense policy keeps the teams flying separately to maximize Navy or Air Force recruiting efforts. Performances with the Army Parachute Team, the Golden Knights, or the Navy Parachute Team, the Leapfrogs, are usually the only exception to this rule.

Since the economic crisis faced by Puerto Rico in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic has seriously aggravated the local economy, Espacios Abiertos is calling for a moratorium on the island's debt repayments.
 “When we analyze the international context and the situation of Puerto Rico in the light of the economic projections contained in the most recent fiscal plan, published by the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority on May 3, it becomes clear that the austerity policies proposed in all the fiscal plans certified so far have contributed to a worsening of the current crisis and, in the final analysis, the unsustainability of the public debt,” said economist and Espacios Abiertos Senior Public Policy Analyst, Daniel Santamaría Ots.
 Given this new situation, Santamaría recommended that in fiscal year 2020-21, all possible resources within the budget of the government’s General Fund, in addition to those federal funds sent to the island for dealing with this crisis, be invested in making the island economy more robust and meeting its citizens’ most pressing needs — all with the purpose of overcoming the health and financial crisis created by the pandemic.
 To that effect, the economist proposed that the creditors of Puerto Rico’s public debt immediately be asked to grant a moratorium or “standstill” of no less than one year, which would entail a suspension of all current payments. He insisted that this action is needed until a clearer picture can be had of the local and worldwide economic situation. Further recommendations by Espacios Abiertos are that an analysis of the sustainability of the public debt be carried out and published, to include the long-term effects of the pandemic; that austerity measures be eliminated once and for all as the guiding principle of the island’s public policies; that the audited financial statements for 2017, 2018, and 2019 be completed and published; and that a realistic and plausible macroeconomic plan be developed.
 “In Puerto Rico, we should consider implementation of the kinds of relief measures for debt payments that are being promoted internationally by various groups of creditors in the private sector and by governments and multilateral organizations in different parts of the world. Economic stimulus packages and monetary policy are being combined with moratoria on the repayment of public debt to provide the fiscal space needed for dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. Puerto Rico needs a moratorium that will not further worsen the General Fund situation and needs, too, a halt to the austerity measures that are doing such great harm to the economy. Given this new pandemic scenario, we should analyze the sustainability of the public debt with integration of a macroeconomic plan and updating of the audited financial statements that will allow us to go to the capital markets in the future with guarantees,” he said.
 According to Santamaría, supranational bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) agree that the current crisis, known now as the “great lockdown,” will lead to the greatest economic slowdown since the Great Depression of 1930. He noted that the government’s new fiscal plan states that the current crisis presents an unprecedented risk scenario for Puerto Rico and points toward unsustainable public debt payments.
 The economist noted that “the new fiscal plan presents projections of declines in the real Gross National Product (real GNP) of -3.8% for fiscal year 2020 and -7.8% for fiscal year 2021.” He also stressed that according to the new fiscal plan, “once the structural reforms and austerity measures are implemented, Puerto Rico will face primary fiscal deficits as early as 2030, rather than 2039 as had been projected in the February 2020 fiscal plan.”

SINGAPORE, May 20, 2020 - (ACN Newswire) - OmniSci, the pioneer in accelerated analytics, announced today that the company posted its highest-ever revenue for a quarter, closing deals with major new customers, strengthening key partnerships, and expanding the company's global reach. OmniSci's strong Q1 performance provides significant momentum for Q2 and beyond.      Following the company's expansion into Europe last year, in April, OmniSci expanded into Asia to meet growing global demand for its analytics capabilities. The company brought Joseph (Joe) Lee on board as VP of Global Sales and welcomed Herfini Haryono, former CTIO at PT Telkomsel and CIO at Indosat Ooredoo in Indonesia, to the team as VP of Industry Verticals. These experienced executives and their teams have already signed the first customers in the region and are providing local support to new and existing customers.      The company's revenue growth was fueled by major wins with new and expansion customers, including Procter & Gamble, HERE Technologies and the utility company Avangrid. OmniSci also announced a deeper partnership with Z by HP to accelerate data-driven workflows and make the Z8 - the world's most powerful workstation - even more appealing by offering it preloaded with the OmniSci platform, giving data scientists instant access to unprecedented analytics power.      "It's been incredible to see how leading organizations in both the commercial and public sectors are adopting our platform to gain an analytical edge," added OmniSci CEO and Co-Founder Todd Mostak. "Whether in telco, retail and CPG, utilities, or government, our customers need speed-of-thought answers from ever-growing volumes of data. The OmniSci accelerated analytics platform empowers them to leverage all of that data with unprecedented agility, and to make better, more timely business decisions than ever possible with legacy tools. We see a tremendous opportunity ahead to expand the market's idea of what is possible when it comes to analytics, and in the process, help build a more data-driven world."      "OmniSci's mission - to make analytics instant, powerful, and effortless for everyone - has never been more relevant. These results show that their technology is meeting that goal," said Kristina Serafim, Managing Director, Verizon Ventures. "As one of our portfolio companies, we support OmniSci's mission to find insights in data at the heart of the most pressing challenges."      In OmniSci's first quarter, the company also engaged in the public fight against COVID-19, providing their platform to research teams across the country through the OmniSci for Good program. Every federal, state and local government is working to cope with COVID-19 and the massive amounts of data involved, and OmniSci helps these organizations make smarter, data driven decisions. Working closely with data partners including X-Mode, SafeGraph, and Veraset, OmniSci showcased through blogs and videos how data can be used to address the core challenges of the next phase of the COVID-19 fight, including hotspot detection, social distancing, and logistics.      Demand within OmniSci's community of developers, researchers and users also grew in the first quarter. When the virus outbreak made in-person events and conferences unsafe, the OmniSci team pulled together two virtual summits on short notice, to keep their active community well connected. These virtual events included dozens of hours of fresh content, and were attended by more than 1,000 people. The next virtual summit is scheduled for May 19-20, 2020, featuring more new demos, webinars and on-demand sessions.      "OmniSci is growing quickly and globally by delivering strong business outcomes for our clients," said Joe Lee. "We are committed to continuing to bring the best solution and support to our clients while we continue our global expansion. We have a unique solution for interactive geospatial analytics that is very valuable in the telecommunications industry, and plugs a significant gap in current big data environments."

State broadcast associations from A to Z (actually from Alabama to Wyoming) this week added their weight to the National Association of Broadcasters petition for changes to the FCC's guidance on political ad disclosures.
 NAB joined with Hearst Television, Graham Media Group, Nexstar, Fox, Tegna and Scripps to ask the FCC to narrow its definition of non-candidate ads on “any political matter of national importance" (i.e. "issue" ads) and the disclosure obligations on broadcasters to identify the issues in those ads.
 Broadcasters want the FCC to narrow the interpretation of "national importance" by specifying that the term applies only to national political actors in position to take national action, which would exclude ads targeted at state and local races, even ones that might mention issues of national importance.
 The state associations did not mince words in expressing their support for the NAB.
 "[T]he FCC has veered sharply from that approach, placing not just heavier burdens on broadcasters’ and issue advertisers’ political speech, but imposing an unconscionable regulatory burden on all broadcasters, from the smallest to the largest," they told the commission, calling it a "sudden deviation" unsupported by the law.
 The FCC issued the guidance as part of the resolution of complaints about TV station political ad disclosures, or the lack of them. The FCC admonished the stations and issued the guidance.
 The FCC said: ”For each request to purchase broadcast time that triggers disclosure… licensees must include in their political files the names of all candidates (and the offices to which they are seeking election), all elections and all national legislative issues of public importance to which the communication refers.”
 Cable operators, who are subject to disclosure rules as well, also support the NAB petition.

 Cory said the bigger tours have kept their contracts for August and September, and some tour companies only canceled for the first six weeks of the season. She said she already had a few boxed lunches scheduled for Monday’s opening.
 A few other businesses had already noticed an uptick in business as of late last week. Under Gordon’s newest health order, all businesses can operate in some capacity.
 Brian Wiegand, owner of Bubba’s Bar-B-Que, said traffic was steady last week in its first day opening the dining room to the public, since the governor’s new order. He said he would have liked more than three days between opening back up and Yellowstone’s opening.
 “It’s challenging to say the least,” he said. “It’s challenging trying to adapt to the new health ordinances.”
 He’s also concerned about finding a large enough workforce this summer.
 “Hopefully we’ll get a little more time before we get a large influx of people,” he said.
 Sourcing J-1 international student employees will be difficult for business owners and there’s a limited pool of local workers, some of whom are making more money on unemployment than they did employed thanks to the extra $600 per week in benefits.
 It has not been announced when Montana’s three Yellowstone gates will open. Furthermore, the Park will only be open for day-use and will have no dining options.

 Only time will tell whether all traffic being directed through Wyoming will bring a change to the dormant economy of the last few months.

Unless you simply enjoy watching government partisans butt heads, or you relish in the spectacle of seemingly inept officials making large claims while achieving few results, or you sort of enjoy watching the political circus - or you just don't give a ____ and long ago gave up "wasting your time" trying to make sense over what our elected leaders purport to do on our behalf, as you watch them flounder in the face of questions related to the coronavirus... you may be left with simple wonderment at the limits of public leadership we are seeing.
   
 We are bound to be frustrated, yet we realize we put our chosen leaders in charge of unraveling an impossible quandary. Many of us might "know" what they should do, but if we are honest, we will admit we can only advise what we think are best options laced with a disheartening remainder of omnipresent failure. Nevertheless, like our leaders during World War II, we must "go for it" against an evil enemy that has invaded us.
   
 Suddenly this treatise is launched into the realm of nearly impossible conjecture, but not to the point of merely giving up and letting it happen. It seems to me, against COVID-19, this means we must mount an aggressive defense rather than wishing it never had happened and acting accordingly. We may not find a defeating cure for the virus right away, but we can mount the most aggressive defense within our means while we continue working to bulwark our offense.
   
 This means we should avoid joining crowds of strangers in places of public accommodation until we see clearer signs COVID is on the run. Meaning, within their relative realms of influence the likes of President Trump and Governor Parson should lay off encouraging businesses to open as usual until they have better reason to believe they are not fomenting a continuation of the pandemic.
   
 We will know more before too long. Better to be safe than sorry, or at least what to be sorry for, so we can react more effectively.

“We have seen a few tourists this morning,” he said Monday, “but just a few.”
 Blaylock has mixed emotions about tourists streaming to town, staging for trips to area attractions. Granny’s needs the business, “but I’m worried about an uptick” in infections that might happen, he said.
 Tina Hoebelheinrich, executive director of the Cody Country Chamber of Commerce, said her office was trying to gear up for the opening as fast as possible after working from home during the lockdown. Hoebelheinrich said she didn’t know if excitement by business owners was “universal,” but said the area is ready for a shot in the arm.
 “I know that economic concerns are pretty serious across all sectors,” she said, adding, “Is our healthcare system ready? Is the business community ready? Are we going to be ready to have a tremendous amount of visitors right off the bat? I wish I had that crystal ball.”
 At a news conference last week, Gov. Mark Gordon had expressed a mixture of excitement and trepidation as Wyoming’s entrances into Yellowstone prepared to open, and as the state continued to ease off its restrictions on public life.
 “We’re doing that in a way that we believe is safe,” Gordon said Wednesday. “And yet I stand before you today knowing that our citizens are at greater risk today because of what we’re talking about with Yellowstone Park than they were. That’s not easy.”
 He said it’s essential to get the country back to work, but urged people to do “the right thing.”
 “I’m very hopeful that as we encourage more visitation to Wyoming [and] we start to see the tourism come back, that people take this seriously for the threat that it truly poses,” Gordon said.
 With the West, North and Northeast entrances in Montana remaining closed, those wanting to visit Yellowstone must travel through either the East Entrance outside of Cody or the South Entrance, outside of Jackson in Teton County.
 Gordon said he didn’t want to see those destinations overwhelmed, which is why he supported Yellowstone’s gradual reopening; visitors on Monday were limited to the lower loop and minimal services were available.
 In a Thursday video message, Cody Mayor Matt Hall said he expects “a lot of pressure” on Cody and Jackson as visitors start to show up. The lack of coronavirus infections in Park County — which has had just one confirmed case of COVID-19 back in March — makes the East Gate the logical choice for Yellowstone visitors, Hoebelheinrich said.
 Teton County has had 69 confirmed cases, and health officials there have generally taken a more restrictive approach for managing the spread of the disease.
 “Anyone who is concerned with coronavirus, are traveling and look at the impact at the local level to choose a gate, it would be more likely that they would choose Cody because we’ve only had one confirmed case,” Hoebelheinrich said. “And I do believe that that’s going to make the community more appealing.”
 Mayor Hall also noted in his video message that Park County has had just one confirmed case of COVID-19 “and we’d really like to keep it that way — whether you think we’ve been lucky or we’ve just been really good doing our social distancing practices that have kept those numbers low.”
 “As we get a lot of people that start to visit our communities, we have to maintain that vigilance of those social distancing measures,” he said.
 The hope is visitors will be patient despite their personal feelings about the pandemic. Hoebelheinrich urges those heading to the park to follow Yellowstone’s guidance.
 “If Yellowstone says to stand 6 feet away from somebody on the boardwalk, do it. If they run traffic only in one direction of a boardwalk, please follow that guidance,” she said. “They really have put some effort and thought into keeping people safe. But at the end of the day, just like petting buffalo, it’s our responsibility to be safe.”

So let’s assume the Dark Age nut jobs infesting the USA don’t win the day, and a new system emerges from the rubble of the currently collapsing world order premised around certain principles of long term cooperation, infrastructure and science investments, rather than the worship of money and debt slavery. Even the most cynical among us must admit that this is at least possible. After all, Russia Gate has increasingly collapsed, General Flynn has been exonerated, and Putin has called repeatedly for an emergency meeting of the five nuclear powers of the UN Security Council to discuss the creation of a new system.
