“If we plan something, it has to be scaleable and global,” said Michael Krueger, USA Football’s senior director of football education. “With technical skill progressions, it helps provide context for the developmental stage of the athlete and for their coaching. A 7-year old is at a way different stage than a 12-year old. The neatest thing about the app is it helps provide that kind of resource and support in the space where we may not have coaches with extensive background. Their knowledge could be extensive or limited. The resources here run the gamut.”

About 250 fabric masks, designed for nonmedical use, are made daily from its shop attached to its headquarters on West Broad Street in downtown Richmond. It also has converted its shirtmaking factories in Poland and China into each facility producing about 25,000 protective masks daily.
 "We were put in this spot where we can help and there is a need for protection," said Paul Trible III, the co-founder and CEO of Ledbury. "And it is keeping our business in business and keeping our factories in business."
 At first, Ledbury began making masks about five weeks ago for VCU Health System and subsequently began selling some to businesses such as Altria Group or Capital One.
 Last Wednesday, it started selling them to customers on its website - a single mask (for $15 each) that is pleated or diamond shaped made in Richmond as well as a three-pack ($25) that has three-layer using anti-microbial cotton that are made at its overseas plants.
 Sales have been strong ever since then, Trible said. "It has doubled our e-commerce business. There is a lot of demand out there."
 Ledbury also is donating 5,000 masks to The Community Foundation for a Greater Richmond for that organization to give to other needy groups. And the company is working with a partnership in New York to provide 10,000 masks for the homeless.
 The company also plans to provide masks free to those Virginia businesses receiving $3,000 grants to help small businesses stay afloat and continue operating during the pandemic.
 The Virginia 30 Day Fund, created in early April, has given grants as of Monday to about 140 small businesses in Virginia, said technology entrepreneur Pete Snyder, who founded the fund with his wife. It has raised more than $900,000.
 "For us, we feel blessed that we have a business that we can operate at this time and we wanted to find ways we can give back," Trible said. "We've gone from a defensive position to an offensive position and one where we can help."
 After hearing about the Virginia 30 Day Fund, Trible said he wanted to find a way to help other small businesses.
 The mission of the fund is to help provide some temporary financial help. Trible said giving those companies masks for their employees will help prepare them for the next steps when the business can reopen or operate under a new norm.
 "We have to make sure these employees are safe and customers are safe. Providing the masks will be helping hundreds of struggling small businesses," said Snyder, who also is the CEO of Disruptor Capital, a Northern Virginia- based venture capital firm. Snyder’s Disruptor Capital made an investment in Ledbury in 2014 and he is a member of the company's board.
 The coronavirus pandemic hit Ledbury hard like it has with many companies.

A riferirlo è il Sindaco di Bisceglie Angelantonio Angarano.
 «A Bisceglie - scrive - abbiamo organizzato il monitoraggio dei treni e degli autobus con presidi di Polizia Locale e volontari di Protezione Civile in stazione e nei pressi del Parco Sant'Andrea. In via precauzionale abbiamo acquisito l'elenco degli autobus Marino che arrivano dal nord e si fermano a Bisceglie (Flixbus ha invece sospeso i collegamenti fino al 17 maggio) e dei treni, includendo anche i collegamenti da Barletta dopo l'arrivo di quelli a lunga percorrenza.
 Sia in stazione che all'arrivo degli autobus saranno raccolti i dati dei viaggiatori, oltre che eseguita la rilevazione della temperatura corporea. A tutti verrà ribadito l'obbligo di osservare scrupolosamente la quarantena disposta da Regione Puglia e saranno fornite loro tutte le indicazioni utili.
 Ricordo che tutti coloro che arrivano da fuori Regione, ivi compresi quelli che si muovono con mezzo proprio, devono compilare il modulo di autosegnalazione online sul sito https://www.sanita.puglia.it/autosegnalazione-coronavirus e osservare 14 giorni di isolamento fiduciario.
 Avremmo voluto dare tutt'altro benvenuto a questi concittadini, però ricordiamo che le misure disposte sono prima di tutto a tutela di loro stessi e dei loro cari, oltre che dell'intera comunità».
