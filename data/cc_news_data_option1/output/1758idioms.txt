The head of the WTA Tour has voiced support for a merger with the ATP Tour following calls led by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to integrate the men's and women's circuits. In an interview with the New York Times published Tuesday, WTA chief executive Steve Simon said a unified circuit made sense. "I'm not afraid of the full merger; I never have been," Simon told the Times. "I would certainly be the first to support it ... Obviously it's a long and winding road to get there, but I think it makes all the sense in the world." Simon's remarks came after Federer and Nadal voiced support for a merger last month. "Just wondering... am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men's and women's tennis to be united and come together as one?" Federer asked in a posting on Twitter. Federer's statement drew enthusiastic support, with Nadal and trailblazing women's tennis legend Billie Jean King among those aligning with the Swiss ace. "I agree, and have been saying so since the early 1970s. One voice, women and men together... Let's make it happen," King tweeted. "I completely agree that it would be great to get out of this world crisis with the union of men's and women's tennis in one only organization," Nadal added. In his interview with the Times, Simon said that any unification was still some way in the distant future. However, the climate of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic could provide the impetus to reach agreement on a merger. "This is a unique time," Simon said. "Crisis and challenges can sometimes provide opportunity as well. "There's going to be no shortage of accountants, tax attorneys, attorneys and everybody else that is involved with it. It would take time, but conceptually it may not take as long. "If you agree on the goal, you can usually get things done quicker." Both the ATP and WTA Tours have been forced to take cost-cutting measures since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted. Both tours have been on hiatus during the crisis, with several tournaments either canceled or postponed. Simon told the Times that a merger was not necessary to ensure the WTA Tour's survival. "This isn't about trying to save the WTA," Simon said. "We'll be fine, but look, if we're going to do the right business thing and we're finally going to bring the sport together, I think the WTA would be very supportive of this concept.

GOPALGANJ (Bihar-UP Border) Despite trains bringing back thousands of stranded migrant labourers from different states, not all of them are ready to wait for their turn.An early morning visit to Gopalganj border,connecting Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, reveals the endless queue of migrants on the way to their native places. Men, women and children with their belongings are on the move, come rain or shine.On Tuesday by 9am, thousands of people from places like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi arrived on the Gopalganj border on foot, carts, taxis -- anything they could manage. As many as 20 counters were set up for labourers to undergo thermal screening and get registered.Mohammad Jabbar, 24, a native of Khagaria district, who is differently-abled, came on his tricycle from Delhi. Jabbar started his journey on April 23. He used to work in a fish market at Gazipur on Delhi border. "It was tiring. I left Delhi as I had no other option left," he said, adding, "I used to cover over 50km every day and took a painkiller during the drive." His is not the only case. Md Armaan left from Jaipur for Araria with 80 people on April 1."All of us used to work together in a stitching unit, which supplied garments to a foreign company, but everything stopped after lockdown. We were unable to sustain ourselves there without money. The landlord asked for rent and disconnected power and water supply when we failed to pay the same" he added.Supaul resident Mohammad Iqbal left from Alwar in Rajasthan with 26 others. "Without work, there was no point in staying there," Iqbal said.Meanwhile, many labourers rued that they did not receive the ₹1,000 assistance in their bank accounts that the Bihar government had announced. Labourers Rekha Kumari, Rabita Kumari, both residents of Champaran said only a few of them were able to avail the cash assistance announced by the state government. "We failed to register and gave up after two or three attempts," said Chandan Kumar, adding, that only those workers were able to avail ₹1,000 who have bank account in Bihar.Meanwhile, a group of 40 students on the way to Saharsa from Madhya Pradesh reached Gopalganj by a taxi, paying ₹55,000. One of the students pleading anonymity said they just ate biscuits during the travel. "In the name of health check- up, we were only thermally screened. We were not given any certificates," said another student.In another case, Rohit Kumar of Purnea said that he along with eight others moved from Bareilly on April 1 and reached here late on Monday night.The wait for another group, comprising of 73 people is getting longer since there is no vehicle to take them to West Bengal from the border area.

Then this covic-19 issue came up. I can't go to farm due to the lockdown as I live close to Ikorodu which is far from the farm. I have used up all d money set aside for the project to feed myself and my family. Where do I begin from. Even if the lockdown is over todayI can't transport myself to the farm as I don't have any cash left. I am watching my only source of income going down the drain. Yet govt is only focusing on the vulnerable that were selected long ago. The Govt should extend the help beyond the vulnerable as the pandemic has made more people to become vulnerable.

ALBANY — New York state is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities as the state faces scrutiny over how it’s protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic.
 At least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state's nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration late Monday that, for the first time, includes people believed to have been killed by the coronavirus before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test.
 Exactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state’s latest disclosure, as the list doesn’t nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sports Illustrated is branching out into movies and television.
 Authentic Media Brands and 101 Studios announced on Tuesday that they will launch Sports Illustrated Studios as part of a joint venture between the two companies.
 The studio's first project will be a docu-series entitled “Covers.” It will explore the stories behind the magazine’s most memorable covers and what went into creating them. Five additional projects are expected to be announced over the next four weeks.
 Authentic Media Brands — which also holds the licensing and trademark rights to celebrities such as Muhammad Ali, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley — acquired the licensing and marketing rights to Sports Illustrated last May from the Meredith Corporation. 101 Studios is best known for producing “Yellowstone” on the Paramount Network, which stars Kevin Costner, as well as recent films like “The Current War: Director’s Cut” and “Burden.”
 The launch comes amid a global shutdown of most sports due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hungry for alternatives, broadcasters have been serving up reruns of classic games and other content, like ESPN's hit Michael Jordan documentary, “The Last Dance.”
 Authentic Media Brands Chairman Jamie Salter said creating a film and television studio represents another key development toward building Sports Illustrated’s brand for the future. Salter also said discussions with 101 Studios CEO David Glasser about joining forces were in the works before ABG completed its acquisition last year.

ROCKLAND -- Massachusetts has a reputation for being one of the most historical destinations in the United States. The South Shore especially stands out with its ties to the founding fathers and early industrialization. What if there was a way to experience that history in person, and not just through a recreation or restoration?
 Architect, writer and amateur photographer David Whitemyer offers a look into this forgotten world of humanity in his new book "Abandoned Massachusetts." The book is a treasure trove of gorgeous photographs from several dozen forsaken buildings across the state, from hospitals to churches to factories and theaters.
    New book on The Association provides a different look at pop  
 In the book, subtitled "Lost Treasures of the Bay State," Whitemyer introduces each set of photos with a short essay that gives context to what these buildings are and why they are there, many of which include examples from the South Shore. For instance, in a passage about factories, he delves into Rockland's long history of shoe-making, and how, at the turn of the century, it's estimated that about 25 percent of America's shoes came from Rockland. There's also mention of Fort Revere in Hull, the South Weymouth Naval Air Station and Wompatuck State Park.
 Whitemyer said the South Shore's prevalence in the book is no coincidence.
 "That is where a lot of the history of Massachusetts got started," he said. "From Plymouth Colony and early shipbuilding industries that continued in the South Shore to Quincy and Hingham."

 Though the book is part of a series by publisher America Through Time, all the photographs were taken by Whitemyer over the course of 10 years. He said the book company reached out to him about putting the book together about a year ago after they found his photos on social media.
 As a hobby, Whitemyer is an "urban explorer," which involves exploring man- made structures like abandoned or hidden buildings, and often, taking pictures of them. Whitemyer described it as "caving in a city." He said he finds these places fascinating.
 "I like imagining them when they were filled with people and thinking about the energy that they had. They were filled with people's lives," he said.
 Whitemyer said he finds it particularly exciting when he comes across evidence of an individual's moment in time.
 "Let's say I'm in factory and I come across a factory worker's table and there's a cup with dried coffee in it or a pair of gloves sitting right next to the coffee cup and a pair of safety goggles," he said. "I always think to myself that those belonged to somebody, and at some point the foreman came in and told them to turn off the machines and that person sat down their coffee cup and oily gloves and never returned. And they're still just sitting there.
 Whitemyer said he also loves being able to see how these spaces decay slowly over time. He said he and other urban explorersctually find it very beautiful.
 "There's a thrill in
    The show will go on: Elliot Norton Awards to be announced May 11 in virtual ceremony  
 being in a space that has decayed naturally and experiencing the silence and solitude within them," he said.
 Whitemyer said many abandoned sites are prime targets for vandals who spray paint graffiti on the walls. To keep them from disturbing these spaces, most of the photographs in the book do not have their locations listed. However, there are a few pictures featured in the book of an ammunition depot that is so covered with colorful graffiti that it's reminiscent of an art exhibit.
 But vandals aren't the only obstacle for urban explorers. Though many of these buildings remained because they were too costly to demolish or renovate, Whitemyer said there's always the chance that they will one day be destroyed. The pictures they take also help document these spaces before they are gone.
 And the parts of the building that often make them too costly to renovate, such as lead paint and asbestos, as well as the natural dangers of a dilapidated building like crumbling floors and walls, broken glass and rusty metal, can also prevent explorers from being able to enter safely.
 "There's been places that I have had access to and made a decision that it was too dangerous," Whitemyer said.
 But for those ready to explore, Whitemyer said these places can easily be found through Google searches, Google Maps and just by keeping your eyes peeled when you are out and about. He said many of the locations in the book were places he stumbled upon while driving.
 "For all I know, there's an abandoned theater somewhere sitting behind some other old building that might just be sitting in the dark," he said. "...There are more of these places that exist than people are aware of."

Rishe says there are at least 2,000 temp workers who rely on the games for income.
 "That amounts to about $250-300,000 in earnings for these gig workers, per game, that are not going to have it because we're not playing baseball," Rishe said.
 There's also the money fans would typically spend at bars and restaurants.
 "It's a trickle effect," Rishe said. "When the people at Ballpark Village and the local restaurants and hotels they don't see that income, then they can't respond it somewhere else in the community."
 While it's unclear when baseball will return, Rishe is confident people will want to share the experience. How they share it is going to really be the issue and he says stadiums and arenas will have to adjust to this new normal.
 "Does that change how we sell seats? Does that change the availability of sanitizer dispensaries around the ballpark?" Rishe said. "All these things are going to have to be considered if we want people to be safe going forward."

MumbaiTo ensure the timely declaration of SSC and HSC results, the state education department has now issued guidelines for allowing the movement of staff for transporting the answer papers of students from one place to another.Citing a Supreme Court order which makes it mandatory for the department to release results of SSC and HSC by June 10, the department has granted special permission for its workers, teachers and school staff to work even as the state is under lockdown. "In a case where the papers are in schools or custody, they can be transported to the examiners and they can evaluate them. Further, these evaluated papers can be sent for moderation to the moderators through staff which is deployed for the purpose," reads the circular issued by the department to all municipal commissioners and district collectors.Nearly 15 lakh students appear the SSC exams from the state of which 3.5 lakh are from the Mumbai division which also includes Thane, Raigad and Palghar. While Raigad is in Orange zone as per the state government's official list, the other areas are in the red zone. The board is hoping that once permissions are in place, evaluation of answer papers can take place soon and results can be declared in time. The state board usually declares Class 12 results in the last week of May and Class 10 results are out by the second week of June."Teachers and other staff can use their vehicles for the task or can use hired vehicles provided to them. Similarly, the staff of the board can also travel to investigate the cases of malpractices that have been reported during the board exam," it further reads.Uday Nare, a teacher at Hansraj Morarji School in Andheri said that the decision should have been taken earlier. "Now teachers would have to race against time to complete evaluation. Nevertheless, the board should now announce the marking formula for the last Geography exam which was cancelled due to the situation," he added.HSC exams took place between February 18 and March 18, 2020, while SSC exams took place between March 3 and March 21.

With the country under a lockdown for more than 40 days, a crash in economic activity during the period was a given, but hopes of a quick rebound after opening up have been revealed to be more wishful than realistic. Signs abound of a slump in demand that could outlast the curbs imposed. Consider India’s Purchasing Managers’ Index reading for the manufacturing sector. From 51.8 in March, when it was barely in expansion territory (above 50), it slipped to 27.4 in April, a level that points to a sharp contraction. A McKinsey survey of Indian consumer sentiment, conducted during the lockdown, showed that 54% of respondents had suffered a loss of income and 67% had reduced spending. While the worst phase in terms of output clamps may be behind us, uncertainty still reigns over future earnings. It is safe to assume that households will be all the more careful with their money now. The sight of liquor stores being swarmed on Monday should not spawn heady forecasts of pent-up demand spurring a post-lockdown revival. There will certainly be bursts of buying; also, periodic gluts of supply as some services and factories get active. In many markets, we should expect demand and supply to follow jagged patterns. All added up, however, both these variables are likely to fall short of last year’s levels—declines that the government must act promptly against.

A day after the Maharashtra government relaxed restrictions to allow opening of non-essential shops including liquor outlets, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday overruled this order for Mumbai after large crowds violated social distancing norms to check the spread of Covid-19. BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, issued a circular on Tuesday stating that only groceries and medical stores will be allowed to stay open. "There are multiple reports, news in social media and inputs received from the police and the ward officials that due to above relaxation there has been huge crowds gathering near these shops and where it has been impossible to maintain social distancing and there were few instances of law and order situation arising out of such crowds gathering at one place."Click here for full Covid-19 coverage. The circular said that while the number of positive cases in Mumbai has been rising, the "gathering of crowds in large numbers without following social distancing will be detrimental to the control of spread of virus and the advantages of the lockdown will be lost".Across the city, there were long queues outside wine shops that made social distancing norms difficult to maintain. The state government on May 3 had issued an order allowing non-essential shops including liquor outlets to be opened across the state in all zones as long as they were limited to 5 shops per lane in red zones.Red zones are so categorised based on the high number of coronavirus cases reported from here. Mumbai falls in the red zone. The number of Covid-19 positive cases in Mumbai is likely to cross the 10,000 mark by Wednesday. Pardeshi in the circular pointed out the relaxations were likely to deteriorate the conditions in Mumbai and hence were being withdrawn for the city. "Hence, I issue orders to assistant municipal commissioner of wards that no such permissions for opening of the five shops which are non-essential be given and the police within each ward jurisdiction will ensure compliance of these orders in toto. Only the groceries and medical shops will be allowed to be opened," the order said.The BMC was earlier contemplating drafting a policy to regulate functioning of these non-essential shops by limiting certain kinds of shops and introducing odd-even opening slots for them. However, the civic commissioner ruled this out in favour of a complete ban. Incidentally, the Mumbai collector had issued an order on May 4 to allow opening of liquor shops but Pardeshi as a BMC civic chief is also an empowered officer nominated by the state government to overrule orders of the state within the purview of the city.

Major League Soccer players will return to team training facilities for individual outdoor workouts starting Wednesday in areas where governments have eased coronavirus pandemic precautions to allow such practices.The voluntary sessions are a small first step toward a resumption of play for the 26-team North American league, which shut down March 12 after two weeks of regular-season matches.MLS has banned full team training through May 15, with no more than four players at a time on a field during the solo workouts and no passing between players allowed."Even if it's individual and we're not training with each other, I think we're all itching just to get back on the field and be training in some capacity with the ball," Houston Dynamo goalkeeper Michael Nelson said in a posting on the team website."I think everyone is really excited about that. Hopefully it's the first step to a bigger opening as well."Seattle Sounders midfielder Cristian Roldan said he looks forward to returning to the complex for training, noting players will need time to restore match fitness before MLS games can resume."I'm hearing that we'll probably have about three weeks to a month to prepare for the season," Roldan said in an MLS website post. "I think that's fair. We understand it takes a lot to get your body back into a 90-minute rhythm."MLS guidelines for the workouts include temperature checks for players on arrival, hand washing and disinfectant stations and designated parking spots to maximize distancing."I do think it'll be some on-the-ball stuff, allowing the players to get some touches in," Real Salt Lake general manager Elliot Fall said."But at the end of the day, the players, they can't be playing balls to each other, so it's going to have to be stuff they can do on their own."Even solo practice sessions will help players by returning to familiar settings."I think there's a real benefit to getting players back to the facility in any capacity, because I think, like all of us, we're all looking for some level of normalcy and life to get back to some semblance of what our reality used to be," Fall said.Nelson said his quarantine workout plans were sorted by Dynamo coaches and staff."Their main concern is staying fit and staying on top of injury prevention things so that when we get back we can hit the ground running," Nelson said.

Scott recently copped a Bugatti Chiron, which costs millions of dollars and is known to be one of the fastest cars in the world- topping out at a speed of 267 mph, and can go from 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds. The 28-year-old is obviously a fan of the luxe car as he made a song called "GATTI" featuring the late Pop Smoke, where he rapped "It cost me three for the keys, Not the work but the V." If he speaks his truths in his raps, that means that the birthday gift came in at around $3 million. Big Bank. Since Bugatti's are still relatively new when it comes to high-performance cars, here are a few facts to get you up to speed.

"articleBody" : "With the continuation of lockdown, which is extended till May 17, has hit hard legal practitioners, especially the junior advocates, whose income depends on the functioning of courts. Though the virtual courts are functioning, very few cases are being taken up, only on the basis of extreme urgency. There is no regular filing of matters and no listing of hearing cases in the courts. This has left a vast majority of lawyers bereft of work, resulting in a massive struggle to make ends meet. While many are just about managing to keep their heads above water, a large number of those practicing in lower courts are unsure of how they will get through this lockdown period, which has been extended till May 17. The Bar Council of Telangana, noticing the concern during this lockdown, decided to help the needy junior advocates and called for applications for financial assistance. The Bar Council received around 6,000 applications but has finalised a list of 3,454 beneficiaries. Earlier, the Bar Council of Telangana decided to give around Rs.5000 to each of the applicants but later on the Bar Council members unanimously decided to grant only Rs.3500 per each applicant. The list of beneficiaries has been placed on the website of the Bar Council. Here, The Bar Council of Telangana has to face the ire of needy junior advocates for granting a mere amount of Rs3,500 only. The Jr. advocates, who were expecting the financial assistance, were disappointed with the decision of granting only a meager amount of Rs 3500. Through social media and other sources, the needy junior advocates are expressing their disappointment over the meager financial assistance saying, in this hard time, been rendered with no legal practice since the lockdown began on March 25, what is the use of all the Hungama at the time of need, which they do not support. The needy junior advocates demand the Bar Council of Telangana to reconsider the extension of financial assistance with a decent amount, with minimal preconditions. They have demand the Bar Council to increase the financial assistance to Rs 10,000 to each junior advocate. It's not charity that anyone is doing, its service to our own community by its own members, they said. In spite of several requests, representations, demands and protests made by the advocates but the Telangana Bar Council yielded no response. What is the use of those welfare funds when they are of no use at this crisis moment, they added. The needy advocates appealed to the State government and the Bar Council of Telangana to extend the financial assistance to the needy junior advocates with a decent amount to cope up the crucial lockdown period.",

Dear Dave,   Should my wife and I tithe on our stimulus checks? She thinks we should, but I'm not sure. In my mind, we already gave our money to Caesar - so to speak - and now he's just giving it back. What do you think?   Luke
 Dear Luke,   Well, it's your money you're getting back. The government doesn't really create anything, it only takes money from us. And in this case, it gave you back some of what it took. I don't really see that as a tithing circumstance.
 The other side of the coin is that you really can't go wrong being generous. The tithe is your baseline for generosity. You shouldn't tithe or not tithe because of a set of rules, but if you're having a theological or philosophical discussion about the tithe and how it works, I think your reasoning is sound.
 It's certainly not a salvation issue, but generosity is a good rhythm to have in your life. And honestly, these stimulus checks are kind of like tax refunds. You gave it to the government, and now they're giving it back.
 So, in my mind, it's okay either way. I've just always had an attitude of when in doubt, it's better to give.   Dave
 Go ahead, knock it out
 Dear Dave,   We make about $70,000 a year, and we're debt-free except for our house. We're following your plan, and just started saving for retirement, but we only have $15,000 left on our mortgage. We can have that paid off in six or seven months, so would it be okay to go ahead and pay off our home as soon as possible before continuing to save for retirement?   Nate
 Dear Nate,   I'm generally pretty hardcore about sticking with the proper order while doing the Baby Steps. But in your case, with such a small amount left to pay on your home, I think I'd go ahead and knock that out.
 Most of the people I talk to still have six figures left on their mortgages. There's a big difference between that and the situation you two are in right now. Think about it, you guys could be completely debt-free by Christmas, and you've already started to make a move on retirement planning. I say go for it!   Dave

“It harkens back to a time when we did more home visits,” Dr. Worth said. “What this is offering is actually seeing people in their home setting which has been quite incredible. Teenagers especially, and some of my elderly patients -- to see how they're living instead of wondering.

“Eventually we see that biometrics will be collected at home too,” Dr. Worth revealed. “People will get, down the road one day, a kit that'll have a blood pressure cuff, a pulse oximeter, a pulse measure … then we won't have to have that person have two caregivers take the day off of work to bring them into our clinic to wait in line to sit in the lobby instead, they'll be in their home.      “It's been incredible. Most of my partners have said it's a window into people's lives that we never even knew we could have.”

That same night, Jacob got up and taking his two wives, two slave girls and eleven children crossed the ford of the Jabbok. After he had taken them across he sent all his possessions over too. And he was left alone. Then someone wrestled with him till daybreak, who, seeing that he could not master him, struck him on the hip socket, and Jacob's hip was dislocated as he wrestled with him. He said, 'Let me go for day is breaking.' Jacob replied, I will not let you go unless you bless me. The other said, 'What is your name ? 'Jacob', he replied. He said, 'No longer are you to be called, Jacob for you have shown your strength against God and men and have prevailed.' Then Jacob asked, 'Please tell me your name.' He replied, 'Why do you ask my name ? With that he blessed him there. Jacob named the place Peni'el, 'Because I have seen God face to face and have survived.' Later to be named, 'Israel', Jacob limps away. Peni'el means 'The Face of God'.
