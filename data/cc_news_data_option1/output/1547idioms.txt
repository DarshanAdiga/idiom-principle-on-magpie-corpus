Be sure to set expectations with your managers on how often they should reach out to their teams. This will connect them with your company’s most important asset — your people. This is also an opportunity to get things done without distraction. Take time to celebrate your team members who are running with things without direction. Lastly, give permission to managers to shoot the breeze. It helps everyone stay connected and ultimately, your managers will connect on a deeper level with their teams.

For Spanish traveler Carlos Payá, being on an around-the-globe luxury cruise while the rest of the world scurried into their homes for fear of the coronavirus was beyond surreal. It was “a stroke of good luck.”
 Now, his trip inside the virus-free bubble that the Costa Deliziosa cruise ship became on its 15-week odyssey has come to an end. The boat steamed Monday into Barcelona, Spain, its first port-of-call after 35 days of continuous sailing with no human contact with the outside world.
 The Costa Deliziosa is one of the last three cruise ships believed to have still been out at sea until Monday, when all are expected to dock. Another of the three, the Pacific Princess, is reportedly due to dock in Los Angeles.
 Unlike other cruise ships that suffered outbreaks and and were often put in quarantine to protect port cities, the Deliziosa has found no cases of COVID-19, according to its owner, Italian cruise company Costa Crociere. So the boat’s 1,831 passengers have been free to use the ship’s facilities and entertainments.

Josh Green used a solid freshman campaign at Arizona to propel himself into the conversation as a first round pick in the upcoming NBA Draft (whenever it will take place). A good athlete who excels when running up and down the court, he showed potential to turn into a traditional three-and-D prospect on the wing. At 6’6” with a 6’10” wingspan, he has the right height, length and strength to defend any wing; he’ll just need to season his skills some more. He also flashed the ability to turn into a good spot-up shooter at the next level. His shot needs some fine-tuning, but the foundation is there.

The face of the economic disaster linked to the coronavirus is human – and it belongs to the people who are self-employed or run small businesses to make ends meet. Josh Silverman, CEO of Etsy, says there are 2.7 million sellers who make their living on the site, and the United States has 57 million small business employees. It’s not the global Fortune 500 titans who are most in need, even though we will see them parade every argument for a bailout. Airlines, for example, are getting infusions despite years of stock buybacks and excessive executive compensation while delivering mediocre service.

It's also implemented a hiring freeze for most positions. And the hospital system's foundation is overseeing a time-off donation program, as well as a financial assistance program, for families in need.
 It's all to avoid the worst of an unprecedented hit to the health care system, he said.
 "What's strange is that health care is traditionally pretty recession proof," Erling said. "What we've proven is we're clearly not pandemic proof."
 No furloughs, layoffs or pay cuts have been imposed at UCHealth, which operates and oversees four hospitals in El Paso and Teller counties, along with several freestanding emergency rooms, primary care offices and urgent care clinics. Still, the hospital system implemented a hiring freeze, one that affects nearly every position except for those related to the pandemic.
 The hospital system also has started a relief fund that offers grants to employees experiencing financial hardships, and a time-off donation program that has amassed nearly 20,000 hours so far.
 To offset their losses, doctors recently began pivoting to telemedicine in unprecedented fashion.
 And some also began forgoing their own salaries to help their administrative staffs weather the downturn and keep their jobs.
 At least 65% of Vanguard Skin Center’s patient visits evaporated as the pandemic set in — a withering total that left the practice scrambling to adjust. Nearly all that remained were appointments for life-threatening skin cancers.
 It was even worse during the pandemic’s opening weeks, said Dr. Vinh Chung, the practice’s founder. But holding many appointments by phone or video has helped blunt that impact.
 Even so, the practice’s finances are in the red, and they’re turning to reserves.
 Chung stopped collecting his paycheck, part of an ethos that “the leaders eat last,” and the dozen other providers at his clinic took 50%-80% pay cuts.
 Some positions of employees who left for graduate school or medical school have gone unfilled. And many of the practice’s 75 employees also voluntarily cut their hours or pay, he added.
 It’s helped Vanguard avoid furloughs or layoffs for the time being. But it isn’t sustainable.
 “For us, we’re going to fight as hard as we can,” Chung said. “We’re doing that because we believe this will pass.
 “We feel we’ve just been dropped into the middle of this large lake and now we just have to figure out a way to swim to shore.”
 Doctors also have gone without pay at Colorado Springs Urological Associates, which saw patient visits plummet at least 75% in the pandemic’s opening weeks before recovering slightly with the switch to virtual visits.
 It isn’t like they aren’t working, though. Emergencies still arise — including one earlier this month where a woman suffered from a kidney stone that had become infected, requiring lifesaving surgery.
 She tested negative for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. But that gave little comfort to Dr. Jeffrey Moody, given that she had all the disease’s telltale symptoms, and tests for it can be unreliable.
 Donning a mask, face shield and multiple gloves, Moody, a urologist, performed the surgery at 2 a.m. — no paycheck waiting at the end.
 It was a rare moment where he was back in the operating room.
 But if he doesn’t return on a more regular basis, he said layoffs would be inevitable.
 “It’s fascinating — like it’s this law of unintended consequences,” Moody said. “You would think at the time of a pandemic, everyone would be busy as all get out.
 “If you had to design a way to dismantle the medical system in America, this would probably be the way to do it.”

In fairness, the government had to put this thing together in just a few weeks. It did not have a good solution it could take off the shelf to provide payroll support to firms, so it came up with this structure that relies on the Small Business Administration to issue forgivable loans to businesses through private banks. Since the SBA already underwrites loans to small businesses and most businesses already have a relationship with a bank, this approach had the advantage of making use of existing infrastructure and personnel.

California’s judicial leaders acted wisely when they reset bail amounts temporarily to $0 for people accused of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies. The decision prevents the dangerous and unnecessary incarceration of defendants who by right ought to be free before their trials, but who instead have been jailed solely because they can’t afford to buy their release on bail. Such needless detention is manifestly unjust in normal times but now is potentially fatal, because inmates by definition cannot be “safer at home” or practice the social distancing and other measures that slow the spread of the coronavirus.
 The Judicial Council’s order also offers a marginal level of protection to the inmates who must remain locked up. They are still in grave danger of contracting COVID-19, but the reduced jail population makes some measure of social distancing behind bars more feasible.
 Refusing to jail people accused but not convicted of lower-level crimes could yet stave off the horrific scenes now playing out in places such as Chicago’s Cook County jail, which has the largest concentration of infected Americans; New York’s Riker’s Island, where more than 300 are infected; and Washington, Kansas and other states where frightened inmates have rioted over officials’ unconscionable failure to protect them from the deadly virus.
 It’s maddening that New York, in the midst of the pandemic, has moved in the opposite direction from California. New York previously adopted a bail reform law that looks in many respects like California’s emergency order, eliminating money bail for people accused of lower-level crimes. But New York’s Legislature rolled back reforms in its recent budget bill, and the state is now keeping in its disease-ridden jails many defendants who have not been convicted of anything — unless they have money for bail. The move will not only cause needless suffering, it may turn a stint at Riker’s Island or other New York jails into a death sentence, even for inmates charged with only low- level crimes, and even if they have not been convicted.

Michael graduated Plainfield North High School in 2015. He graduated early so that he could join the US Army reserves and ship out to bootcamp where he was trained at Ft. Leonard Wood for Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training for his job as a Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear specialist (CBRN). Michael had been volunteering with the Wounded Warrior Project since he was 13 years old and lives the idea of service to others. Upon returning home he attended Northern Illinois University and became an Emergency Medical Technician working at Elite Ambulance. Michael has a heart for others as evidenced by his love and care for his siblings and elderly grandparents. Michael deployed to the Middle East in 2019 where he served nearly a year. Upon getting his orders to return, his unit was the last flight allowed to leave before travel to the US was halted due to Coronavirus. Upon returning to the US, his and other units spent two weeks in quarantine in Texas. As they prepared to be sent home, one of the other units had personnel test positive and that unit was denied being able to come home… Michaels unit was fortunately spared this and given a clean bill of health to come home. When he was picked up at O'Hare, it was a surreal experience, an empty airport, no families holding signs, no running hugs and family reunification as Corona has desimated those types of gatherings leaving many soldiers to rent a car to get home. When he got in the car Michael immediately said, can I have some McDonalds, I have been eating camel meat for too long. He ordered 3 McDoubles a large fry and large coke and almost immediately got sick, but it was worth it! Michael is already itching to get back to helping others and is cocnsidering working on an ambulance again until he returns to school at SIUE in the fall with the goal to eventually become a Physician's Assistant. His family is complete again, and thankful for all the support that the people of the Plainfield area have given him which was evident by the welcome home parade. Afterward, Michael sitting on the couch in the living room said he just couldn't believe all those people would do that for him. He is a humble servant to others, and a leader by example.

With a view to their relevance in the coronavirus crisis, the authors examine, among other things, several areas covered by the IHR. In this way, they provide an overview of the legal situation and show to what extent the regulations apply under the current circumstances. In doing so, they also contextualize recent political controversies, such as the one between the U.S. and China ignited by President Donald Trump, who accused the latter country of not complying with the obligation enshrined in the IHR to promptly report the new disease to the WHO. With regard to this specific case, von Bogdandy and Villarreal point out that the IHR provides the WHO with the means to legally assess the accuracy of such allegations. In such a case, it may not only refer to official governmental communications, but may also take into account other information, such as journalistic reports. In this specific situation, the authors argue that the WHO could, for instance, compare the data provided by the government with such other reports and, in the event of any inconsistencies, ask the Chinese Government for clarification. This and other examples demonstrate that the WHO norms on disease reporting also play a role in health-related geopolitical conflicts.

Last week, I caught up with one of the workers I met last year as I was reporting a column about labor violations at a Koreatown barbecue restaurant.
 Anderson Casteñon was the cook who prepared meats, side dishes, sauces and salads at Genwa Korean Barbecue. The high-end restaurant, which is popular among celebrities, has locations in Beverly Hills, downtown Los Angeles and Hancock Park. Casteñon’s boss cut his hours but required him to do the same amount of work, all without bathroom or meal breaks.
 I didn’t use his name or the name of the restaurant then because I wanted to protect him from retaliation, but now there’s nothing to protect. He was laid off at the end of February, along with most of the restaurant’s staff, because of a downturn in business related to coronavirus fears.

In a best-case scenario, Green turns into one of the better wing defenders in the NBA, allowing the Bucks to continue their journey as the best defensive team in the league.

F.L. "Bud" Shannon, 78, of Parks Township, passed away on Friday, April 17, 2020, at home, surrounded by his loving family.
 Born Jan. 2, 1942, in Natrona Heights, he was a son of the late James Patrick and Margaret (Haddon) Shannon.
 Bud was a 1959 graduate of Vandergrift High School, and was the well-known owner/ operator of Shannon Auto Sales on River Road in Parks Township. He was heavily involved with the local community, with memberships including the Sokol Club No. 255 in Leechburg, where he was a former vice president, and officer at the MCT meetings; the Elks Club in Tarentum; the Slovak Clubs in East and North Vandergrift; the Moose Lodge No. 102 in Leechburg; the Armstrong County Sewage Enforcement Agency, where he served as the former chairman; the Armstrong County Planning Commission, the Chairman of Parks Township Supervisors from 1989-2019; the Member of Armstrong County Solid Waste Advisory Commission; the PA Cleanways Association; and was the first vice president of the Armstrong County Elected Official Association.
 As much as Bud was known for his auto sales and his community service, he was also known for his skilled guitar playing as member of Bud Shannon and the Country Gentleman. In 2017, Bud was the recipient of an award by the Casino Theatre for his entertainment contributions in the Alle-Kiski area.
 In addition to his parents, Bud was preceded in death by his infant brothers, Jim and John.
 Bud is survived by his loving wife of 58 years, Marjorie "Margie" (Hoffer) Shannon; sons, James Patrick Shannon, of Kepple Hill, John Paul (Mary Jane) Shannon, of Parks Township; grandchildren: Nicole, Julie, Sara, Sadie, Sophie and Samuel Shannon; great-grandchild, Keis Masterson; his close friend, Mike Cravener, of Tarentum, who Bud thought of as another son; and last but not least, his beloved dog, Katie.
 Due to state mandates regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be no public viewing. Private services with interment in St. Catherine Cemetery, Gilpin Township, will be held at the convenience of the family. A Celebration Of Life to honor Bud's life will be announced at a later date. Arrangements have been entrusted to the Curran Funeral Home and Cremation Services, Leechburg. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be offered in Bud's memory to the Good Samaritan Hospice, 134 Marwood Road, Cabot, PA 16023.

This should be comforting for executives and employees alike. Executives should look forward to a more productive, engaged workforce that flexes more of its mental muscle and companies that run better in general. But their aim shouldn’t be to cut headcount as much as possible — that’s a losing proposition and arguably decades premature. Employees will benefit from this mindset, as well. Instead of fearing that their jobs will disappear, they should start adapting to working alongside automation to find the ways it can help them be better at their jobs and, ideally, more stimulated and satisfied. A little proactivity from both sides will go a long way. At the end of the day, a robot that can completely replace human decision-making is still solidly in the realm of science fiction.

For Spanish traveler Carlos Payá, being on an around-the-globe luxury cruise while the rest of world scurried into their homes for fear of the COVID-19 pandemic was beyond surreal. It was “a stroke of good luck.”
 Now, his trip inside the virus-free bubble that the Costa Deliziosa cruise ship became on its 15-week odyssey is coming to an end. The boat is steaming toward Barcelona, Spain, where it will make its first port-of-call on Monday after 35 days of continuous sailing with no human contact with the outside world.
 “It was not surreal. It was incredible,” Payá told The Associated Press by text messages on Saturday evening. "We have family in our home countries. The news that was arriving from home was causing us all a lot of worry and grief. For us, it was a stroke of good luck to be where we were.”
 The 58-year-old Payá, a sports writer travelling with his wife, said when news started to reach the boat of the rapid spread of the coronavirus in their native Spain, their first desire was to get home to their two grown children in their hometown of Valencia.
 But with ports denying the boat entry, they have had to temper their concern with the amenities on board.
 Unlike other cruise ships that suffered outbreaks and and were often put in quarantine to protect port cities, the Deliziosa has found no cases of the COVID-19 virus, according to its owner, Italian cruise company Costa Crociere. So the boat’s 1,831 passengers were free to use the ship's facilities and entertainments.
 Payá said that the ship, which set sail from Venice in early January, stopped making ports of call after leaving western Australia last month. Overall, he praised the ship's captain and crew for their care.
 He said that the passengers' last chance to touch land was in Perth, where they docked after “70 wonderful days” of crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. That was when the U.N. World Health Organization alerted the pandemic in March. From that point the ship made only technical and refueling stops, before the journey back toward the Mediterranean, which took it through the Suez Canal, according to the company.
 “Of course, for those of us who have children in Spain, we would have preferred to return,” Payá said. “Other passengers, on the other hand, given their old age wanted to stay on board knowing that the boat was safe and secure.”
 A company spokesman said a passenger left the ship earlier in the week in Marsala, Sicily, for health issues and had a COVID-19 test, which was negative. Costa said the passengers were confined to their cabins only for the period until the ship heard back that the ill guest who got off in Sicily had tested negative. It didn’t say how long that period lasted.
 The Deliziosa, a nearly 300-meter (1,000-foot) vessel, will disembark 168 Spanish passengers on Monday at Barcelona’s port. Then the Deliziosa will head to its final destination, Genoa, Italy, where it is expected to let off the remaining passengers, Italians and those of other nationalities, on Wednesday. The Deliziosa was originally due to return to Venice on April 26.
 French authorities had rebuffed a request by Costa for permission to disembark several hundred passengers from France and nearby countries at Marseilles. “The health situation on board the ships, with 1,814 guests and 898 members of the crew, doesn’t present any problem for public health and no case of COVID-19,” Costa’s statement said.
 While people infected with the coronavirus often experience mild or moderate symptoms, possible complications like pneumonia can put their lives at risk.
 Passenger Jean-Pierre Escarras, from Marseilles, shot a video of their cabin that their daughters shared on social networks, in which he says: “This is our place of confinement. We are lucky to have a window.”
 The couple said that after a stop in Sydney, the ship’s activities were “reduced or sometimes canceled. We haven’t been able to get out on land since March 14 – that’s 34 days.”
 The passengers said that ports in Oman, along the Suez Canal, as well as in the Seychelles and Indian Ocean ports, refused to let the ship dock.
 The company said, because the ship is Italian-flagged, it followed Italian precautionary measures used in the pandemic, including safety distancing between guests such as managing the numbers of who could enter food areas at any one time, and transmitting entertainment to cabin TV sets.
 A French woman whose in-laws are aboard the Deliziosa garnered about 100 signatures on an online petition to urge the French government to intervene to get them home.
 The regional administration for Bouches-du-Rhone in southern France cited a nationwide ban on allowing foreign cruise ships to dock, as part of France’s virus-related confinement measures. Italy has also barred foreign cruise ships as it battles the virus outbreak.
 The French administration has granted exemptions to six other cruise ships in recent weeks to allow French passengers to get off, but refused this time, saying the previous stops overstretched local police and health authorities already mobilized to fight France’s severe virus crisis.
 Last month, two other Costa cruise ships pulled into Italian ports, including one that earlier had aboard passengers who tested positive for COVID-19 before being disembarked in France.
 It is unclear if or where the passengers who were due to finally step on land after weeks of sailing aboard the Deliziosa would be quarantined as a precaution.
 What is clear is that Payá and the other passengers are returning to a new reality of home confinement, face masks, and even more worry.
 “The return home will mean a radical change, a brutal one,” Payá said on Sunday after packing his bags before spending his last night on the Deliziosa. “Fear is what made many passengers want to stay on board. But it is something that we must face, just as our families, friends, and neighbors already have.”

 Opening up on what he specifically likes about Elland Road, Tyler said: "The recently-constructed Bremner Square pays tribute to the charismatic captain in the club's glory days. It is also a stylish reminder of the era from the mid 60s to the mid 70s when Leeds United were one of the top sides not just in England but also in Europe.
 "Twenty years ago European nights were also very special here. Under Marcelo Bielsa you feel the return of the good times could be just around the corner."

A Colleton County deputy stopped a vehicle on April 3rd near Cromwell Lane in Walterboro because that vehicle’s driver did not use a turn signal. Ultimately, the driver was arrested for possession with intent to distribute meth, possession of marijuana and possession of a controlled substance.   According to a Colleton County Sheriff’s Office incident report, the deputy stated in his report that he recognized the occupants in the vehicle from “previous encounters.” The driver admitted to having a .22-caliber revolver in the book bag beside him, and a handgun in the center console of the vehicle. The .22-caliber came back as being stolen, according to an NCIS check done on the gun at the traffic stop, the report states. The serial numbers from the second handgun taken from the vehicle were also scrubbed off, indicating it had been stolen. This was not confirmed in the incident report.   Additionally, several baggies of narcotics were found inside the bookbag, including 2.48 grams of meth of a crystal substance, 1.04 grams of meth, 7.17 grams of marijuana, and approximately 20 pills. Needles were also found in the bag. Additionally, several checks were found, all made out in various amounts and from a person who is listed as being deceased. During a search of the vehicle, a third gun was also found. That gun came back as being “clear” or not stolen, the report states.

And worse, colleges and universities are now looking down the road to a likely recession. It’s unclear what a recession will mean for enrollment this time around. Normally, college enrollment spikes in recessions as people seek to reskill for the new economy. Or they choose to enroll given the poor job prospects, though they wouldn’t have otherwise. But families feeling uncertainty around the economy right now might decide against enrolling — or at least consider a gap year.

How do you feed a family during the COVID-19 outbreak, without stepping out of the house? “Check your pantry. Walk to your backyard. Open the refrigerator. Flip through old recipe books. Call your friends and family! You will find all the ingredients and know-hows to create simple, delicious meals right within your reach,” explains Fremont, US-based Alagu Al, who organised virtual cookery demonstration and presentation by home chefs last week.
 The financial controller for a tech company is also the founder of a WhatsApp group called ‘SamayalSamayal’, a by-invitation only forum for food, culinary traditions and health started in 2018, Alagu feels that it is important for people to not step out of their homes. “As part of the WhatsApp group, we generally organise two live demonstrations ever year in [San Fransisco’s] Bay Area, for about 100 families. Keeping the current scenario in mind, we have to first fulfill our moral and civic responsibility of staying home. It is also the time to use our resources wisely, stay connected with friends and family, and keep spirits high,” she says, adding that this sparked the idea for a virtual cooking demonstration, open out to people across the United States. The event was hosted on Zoom, featuring live demonstrations of five dishes (appetisers, main course, sides and dessert), along with a two-minute presentation each of 85 dishes already cooked.
 The demonstrations began with a twist on the kuzhipaniyaram, using pancake flour. The second dish was four kinds of chickpea-based chutney (the most popular was the chocolate chickpea dip, paired with grilled idli). The _rava_ khichdi followed, and a further extension of that were the toasted _rava_ balls which work great as an evening snack. On a healthier note, the fourth participant, who happened to be a doctor, created a _thengaipal vengaya_ (coconut milk and onion) kanji and paired it with a tangy _paruppu_ _thuvaiyal_. The finale was a French cream horn — a decadent dessert that reminded viewers of French pastry shops — created from scratch by a teenage boy.

My own investigations pondered whether there were millions of CPAP machines already present, mostly unused, in people’s homes, which might get converted with new software and small amounts of additional hardware into ventilators. Compared to new designs, these systems would be already manufactured and tested. While millions purchase CPAP machines, many find they don’t tolerate the therapy well and give up, leaving the machine on the shelf. Others upgrade machines and store the old one. It is suspected that a large number of people might gladly offer the unused machines, or go back to their old machine to let their new one save a life. (Many also often sleep without their machine, at a minor risk to their own health, which they would gladly take if they could save a dying patient by doing so.) According to Nunez, the number of spare machines is not nearly that high, since patients who give up on the therapy usually are made to return the machine if it was paid for by insurance.

Payá said that the ship, which set sail from Venice in early January, stopped making ports of call after leaving western Australia last month. Overall, he praised the ship’s captain and crew for their care.
 He said the passengers’ last chance to touch land was in Perth, where they docked after “70 wonderful days” of crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. That was when the U.N. World Health Organization alerted that COVID-19 had become a pandemic, in March. From that point on, the ship made only technical and refueling stops before the journey back toward the Mediterranean, which took it through the Suez Canal.
 “Of course, for those of us who have children in Spain, we would have preferred to return,” Payá said. “Other passengers, on the other hand, given their old age, wanted to stay on board knowing that the boat was safe and secure.”
 A Costa Crociere spokesman said a passenger left the ship earlier in the week in Marsala, Sicily, for health issues and had a COVID-19 test, which came back negative. Costa said the passengers were confined to their cabins only for the period until the ship heard back that the ill guest who got off in Sicily had tested negative. The company didn’t say how long that period lasted.

Increasing numbers of professional footballers are struggling with anxiety and depression having been forced out of action with the sport suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report by global players' union FIFPro released on Monday.
 FIFPro surveyed 1,602 players across 16 countries, including England, Scotland, France, Australia and the United States, with 468 female players featured in the study.
 It found that 13 percent of male players surveyed, and 22 percent of female players, reported symptoms of depression. Close to one in five of both male and female players reported symptoms of anxiety.
 "In football, suddenly young men and women athletes are having to cope with social isolation, a suspension of their working lives and doubts about their future," said Vincent Gouttebarge, a French former player who is FIFPro's chief medical officer.
 While many countries have gone into strict lockdowns in attempts to slow the spread of Covid-19, Gouttebarge pointed out that many professional footballers live in foreign countries without family, and in many cases suffer added anxiety because of being on short-term contracts.
 The FIFPro survey follows an identical study undertaken in December and January which found that the percentage of players reporting symptoms of depression were much lower -- just 11 percent among females and six percent among males -- although it involved only 307 players.
 "In us performing the study and publishing these results we are very conscious that what we are communicating here is a reflection of a problem in broader society that affects many more people than our members," said FIFPro's General Secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann.
 "I think the emphasis should be more on understanding that football players in general are actually more similar to average society than most people think."
 Footballers in many countries have been confined to their homes with competitions having been suspended since mid-March.
 Discussions are ongoing among federations and governing bodies about how and when the season can resume, with Europe's biggest leagues hopeful of starting again soon with matches behind closed doors.
 However, Baer-Hoffmann sounded a note of caution and dismissed suggestions that the study provided any argument for rushing back onto the field.
 "If we were to pressure players back in an environment where they may feel their safety is being put in danger, then it would rather add to their anxiety and concern," he said.

Since early March, Breed has garnered national attention, both for being out in front of the pandemic and playing the role of a reassuring, sometimes scolding, civic leader.
 On Feb. 25, before the city had a single confirmed case of coronavirus, Breed declared a state of emergency. The order, issued after similar action by harder-hit Santa Clara County, allowed San Francisco to prepare for the pandemic. In early March, the city banned all mass gatherings of 1,000 or more people, prohibiting fans from heading to Golden State Warriors games at the new Chase Center.
 The city’s first female African American mayor, Breed, 45, has been seemingly everywhere during the crisis, usually remotely. She was on CNN again on Saturday night, and has been addressing the media at least three times a week. She’s also been sharing information behind the scenes, fielding calls from mayors nationwide asking about the city’s response.
 Nearly each day, she’s applied her powers to changing circumstances. She issued an order putting a lid on how much delivery companies could charge restaurants, helped establish emergency child-care centers for the children of front-line workers, and created a call center for people in isolation or quarantine who need groceries.

For more than two decades, the system codified in federal law for ensuring that persons prohibited from possessing a firearm are not able to lawfully acquire one from a licensed firearms retailer has worked reasonably well. Since 1998 when the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or "NICS," became operational, the FBI has completed hundreds of millions of background checks on prospective gun purchasers; 28.4 million last year alone.
 For some reason, however, the FBI recently has taken to playing games with NICS, and by bureaucratic fiat ignoring or overriding an important provision in the law. Neither firearms purchasers nor retailers should stand for such skullduggery.
 The provision at issue is that which permits the FBI to place what amounts to a "hold" on a prospective firearm purchase, in order to allow the Bureau time to determine if a particular purchaser falls within one of the several categories of persons not permitted to possess a gun. Under the law establishing NICS, with the FBI as the "go-to" agency, that temporary "hold" is strictly limited to "three business days."
 While the vast majority of inquiries submitted to the FBI each year by firearms dealers (Federal Firearms Licensees or "FFLs") are approved or denied almost immediately (hence, the "instant" check system), occasionally there are those that raise questions, and in each such instance, the FFL is notified and the statutorily allowed "three business day" period begins to run. If the dealer does not receive a denial within that window, the dealer is permitted at its discretion to allow the purchase (or "transfer") to proceed.
 The three-business-day hold period is clearly defined as days in which "state offices are open" in the particular state where the transaction is taking place. This particular language was designed so as not to box the FBI into having to resolve the potential problem with a purchaser's background on a Friday right before a three-day state or federal holiday. For the past 22 years this has been the common understanding. Until now, that is.
 Since the announcements over the past several weeks of federal and state-level COVID-19 "state of emergency" decrees, during which many businesses and public events are closed, FFLs have been receiving notices from the FBI that certain transactions are delayed not for three business days, which is the maximum the law allows, but for 30 days or even longer.
 Although the volume of requests to NICS during the current pandemic is unprecedented and places a strain on the Bureau's staff in meeting the requirements of the law, there is _no_ provision in federal law permitting the Bureau to extend any purchase "hold" beyond three business days.
 The FBI may be interpreting the pandemic-based emergency decrees in effect in every state as constituting days in which state government offices are not "open." If so, this is a subterfuge. State offices in all 50 states remain open, albeit under limiting guidelines set by the federal government and by individual state governors.
 Businesses that receive notices from the FBI declaring planned firearms purchases are delayed for extended periods beyond the lawful maximum three business days are put in a delicate position. While such notices clearly are inconsistent with the law, if the retailer receiving one allows the sale to go forward after three business days - as the business is permitted to do lawfully - and the FBI later notifies the retailer that the buyer is in fact a prohibited person, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to foresee potential legal issues looming.
 Moreover, NICS checks are valid only for 30 days, so a retailer who obeys a 30-day (or even longer) hold and receives no denial during that time, places the purchaser in the position of having to come back and start the process all over again in a potential never-ending loop.
 The director of the FBI should step in and stop this bureaucratic skullduggery, and if he will not, the Attorney General should. Anti-gun state and local government officials are trying every trick in the book during this pandemic to deny law-abiding citizens the ability to exercise their rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. Americans do not need bureaucrats at the FBI making it even more difficult.

The vision was to create a simulator where you could experiment with life (style, build, and tell stories) and observe how Sims responded to your choices. We have never left that path, but we will continue to evolve the game.”
 So, the secret formula is ‘stay on par and listen to the community’. When designing a game like The Sims, it seems there would be a knack for designers to go overboard but how does EA know when to draw a line and leave the rest to the players? Mike points to Maxis, a game developer studio founded in 1987 by Will Wright. The studio brought The Sims to life and was later acquired by Electronic Arts in 1997. “We do not have some documented line or rule we apply,” Mike elaborates, adding, “We rely on the team of people at Maxis who have been bringing The Sims to life for over two decades to know when it is right. I think it is fair to say it is instinctive.”

Very few collegiate athletic programs break even, but gung ho alums and powerful politicians love them, so some subsidy became politically accepted and even demanded in recent decades. However, Covid-19 is clobbering college sports. Already, the loss of NCAA March Madness revenues is costing schools hundreds of millions. Football ticket revenue, already falling ominously at some schools, is likely to be down tremendously in the fall even if games are played. Football, in turn, subsidizes a multiplicity of minor sports.

William Bill O. Sutton, 89, formerly of Bradford Woods, peacefully left to be with the Lord Wednesday, April 15, 2020. Born to Orie and Roxy Sutton, Bill grew up in Evans City, graduating from Evans City High School. He went on to Butler Business School to receive an accounting certificate. After working for a bank in Butler for a few years, Bill enlisted into the U.S. Air Force. He served just shy of four years in Germany during the Korean war. As a sergeant, assigned to be the Chaplin's assistant, he led an adult Sunday school class of 300 and more. Here, he found his calling to be an educator. After the service, Bill attended Slippery Rock University to obtain a teaching degree, then transferred to Penn State for a master's degree. Bill got his first teaching job at Shaler Schools, later to be Shaler Area School District in 1957, where he stayed until retiring in 1989. In 1960, he married his bride of 54 years, who preceded him in death. Together, they raised their family in Bradford Woods where Bill stayed until moving to Ingomar to live with his daughter and her husband in 2015. Over the years, Bill enjoyed traveling to England, Europe, and across the U.S. with his bride. He had a passion for the fine arts, especially classical music. He was a founding member of the Pittsburgh Concert Chorale and enjoyed performing for local concerts as well as New York City, and singing at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Bill also sang in a number of television commercials. Bill has always been an active member of his church, serving as Elder, Deacon and other roles in the church, including choir and Sunday School teacher. He was well loved and served Memorial Park Church for over 40 years. Bill was also a charter member of the National Cathedral from when it was being constructed through the final completion in the early '90s. Beloved husband of the late Phyllis Gundlach Sutton; dear father of Bronwynn (Michael) McAdams, William (fiancée Debra Vogel) Sutton, Christina Broeren and Christian (Pamela) Bigley- Sutton; proud grandfather of Holly and Ezra Broeren, Joshua and Timothy Sutton, Peyton Bigley and the late Justin Broeren; and dearly loved brother of Jean Sutton of Evans City. SUTTON - Due to current world events, a memorial service for William Bill O. Sutton, who died Wednesday, April 15, 2020, will be held at a later time. Arrangements entrusted to Schellhaas & Sons Funeral Home. In lieu of flowers, donations can be given to Good Samaritan Hospice and/or Memorial Park Church.

“I have heard a juvenile judge say, on the record, that the evidence a juvenile is at increased risk from COVID-19 by virtue of being in the juvenile halls and camps is just speculative, and in the same breath say that we’re all at some level of risk anyway,” said Andy Bouvier-Brown, a criminal defense attorney who often represents juveniles. “Judges have pointed to the fact that there aren’t any confirmed positive tests of kids in the hall as evidence that they are not currently at risk.”
 Last week, the Loyola Law School Center For Juvenile Law and Policy and the Independent Juvenile Defender Program petitioned the California Supreme Court to release a wide category of youths being held in L.A. County. The list includes any juveniles with a health condition that places them “at higher risk of” contracting the coronavirus, as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; any juvenile exhibiting symptoms associated with the virus; and any youths being held on either a probation violation or failure to appear in court.
 The petition also highlighted a courtroom logjam in L.A. County that may be slowing hearings for juvenile releases. Fewer than half of the county’s 18 juvenile judges are currently hearing cases, the court filing said. The petition also suggested that youths and their attorneys were being given little chance to plead for early release, even with the support of the Probation Department.
 Both the Probation Department and a court spokeswoman declined to comment on the petition.

Across California, elected officials have moved swiftly to lower jail and prison populations, hoping to reduce the risk of a rapid surge in coronavirus behind bars. In late March, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the early release of 3,500 inmates who had been convicted of non-violent offenses and had less than 60 days left on their sentences. Hundreds of adults have been released from L.A. County jails under similar circumstances.
 Nationally, advocates, attorneys and relatives of youths in custody have expressed frustration that similar efforts have not gained traction in the juvenile justice system, even as reports of outbreaks begin to pop up in youth facilities. On Friday, health officials confirmed that 25 juveniles had tested positive for the coronavirus at a facility outside Richmond, Va. Juveniles in custody have also tested positive for the illness in Maryland and Louisiana, according to published reports.
 In recent weeks, L.A. County probation officials say they’ve made an effort to shrink the population of juvenile halls and camps, submitting to the courts a list of 59 young detainees to be considered for early release. The court released 39 of the youths and set an additional 27 free last week without the Probation Department’s recommendation, Adam Wolfson, communications director for the agency, said.
 Ann Donlan, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Superior Court, said more stringent conditions must be met under California law to secure the release of young offenders.

“Alternatives and repurposing was the backbone to every dish presented. The idea was not for people to run to the grocery store and pick up ingredients. For example, the pancake flour _kuzhipaniyaram_ was served with _kollu_ (horse gram) chutney — if you did not have _kollu_ at home, you could use walnut and other nuts,” she explains. Each presenter had to think of substitute ingredients, tools and techniques and create a dish using minimal ingredients.

Voigt said it costs about $2,500 per acre to till, fertilize and spray for disease just to prepare for planting.
 "The processors came back to the growers a week and a half ago and said, 'Stop planting. We can't commit to buying potatoes if we don't have a home for them.' There really is no other crops they can grow that will recover that type of loss," Voigt said. "We hope the USDA will step up and help them cover those losses."
 Potato sales recently got a boost in grocery stores as unemployed workers remained at home and had more time to cook from scratch using raw spuds. However, even that demand has fallen away as panic buying slows, Voigt said.
