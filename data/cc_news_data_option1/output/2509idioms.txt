A defense attorney filed a motion Thursday on behalf of the ex-officers to allow recording of all pretrial and trial proceedings. The motion argues that the recordings are necessary to guarantee the officers get a fair trial in light of what the defense calls "multiple and inappropriate public comments" by prosecutors and other officials.

ATLANTA (CBS46) – On the same day American Airlines announced it will again start selling middle seats to passengers, Atlanta-based Delta Airlines said the empty middle seat is here to stay for the next few months.


  “We will be extending the cap on the planes post-September, whether it’s 60 percent or a slightly higher number, I don’t know, but yes, we absolutely will,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian told the BBC about the company’s plans to keep passenger numbers on flights capped.


  Mr. Bastian said the recovery from the economic damage from the coronavirus will be “choppy” and said Delta was “reinforcing wearing masks, social distancing, and keeping our planes only at 60 percent full making sure every seat next to a customer is open so you have space on board.” Bastian also warned that despite all the precautions Delta will take, “until there’s a vaccine, it’s going to be very hard to see this industry back to scale.”

Unable to let grieving families in their facilities during the height of the COVID-19 crisis in the state — when at least 200 people were dying on a daily basis from the novel coronavirus — funeral homes were also finally given the okay to plan in-person wake and memorial services. However, for the time being, funeral directors are required to adhere to a 40 percent occupancy threshold.


  Retail establishments may also let customers use dressing rooms for the first time, but only if appointments are booked in advance.


  Under Phase I, both department stores and mom and pop retailers who don’t sell food, cleaning supplies, or building materials were allowed to begin serving customers under a curbside service model that began on May 25.


  Six days later, under the start of Phase II, customers were invited back inside clothing and retail stores, but at a significantly reduced capacity. Lastly, office buildings and parks, allowed in May to partially reopen under Phase I, are as of this week allowed to occupy spaces at a 50 percent capacity.


  Meanwhile, restaurants owners, some of whom have been able to serve customers in new outdoor seating areas over the past two weeks, are now able to serve meals indoors.


  Though technically able to utilize exterior dining areas since June 1, many eateries, trying to secure permission to use private outdoor patios and parking lots or needing permission from cities and towns to use public spaces, have only just begun serving in-house meals again.


  Still left shuttered across Massachusetts are the state’s taverns and bar rooms, gyms and fitness centers, theaters and sports complexes, and museums, aquariums, amusement parks, and adult learning centers.


  Though some of those venues such as professional sports complexes and amusement parks are operated by deep-pocketed corporations, the start of Phase 3 still involves many small and medium-sized businesses, not to mention a myriad of non-profit organizations that oversee historical and cultural sites and art studios and performance halls.


  Based upon Baker’s original commentary about his four-phased plan, first unveiled in mid-May, he will wait at least three weeks between the start of each phase before launching a new wave of openings. Based upon that timeline, Phase III will not begin until at least July 6, with a late July/early August start to Phase IV.


  According to local officials, perhaps the biggest obstacle being faced by businesses is trying to understand the rules around the state’s complicated reopening plan.


  For example, as Egan recalled, when Baker first allowed “non-essential” businesses to reopen, many area merchants were unsure of how to measure the required six-foot distance between tables, how to stripe one-way shopping aisles, what types of products were needed to be provided at new sanitation stations, and what to do about proposed worker temperature checks and other prevention measures.


  There have also been legal questions about adhering to mandatory face covering rules — not the least of which revolve around business liability concerns should someone become sick — as well as questions about the formulation of required COVID-19 workplace safety and sanitation plans.


  “People were asking if they had to track their customers. They were concerned. Would you want to sign your name [in a log] when going into a paper store?” Egan explained. “They also wanted to know what to do if someone was scared to return to work, and if taking people’s temperature and writing it down created a medical record [that needed to be safeguarded according to federal regulations].”


  “There was just so much confusion,” she added. “There was misinformation all over the place. You really need someone to help you figure out the maze of information. That’s why I’m happy to chat with anyone.”


  Besides turning to local Chambers of Commerce and business associations, local businesses have also found some allies in some surprising places.


  For example, in Stoneham, Town Health Agent John Fralick III, who in a sometimes adversarial role finds himself citing some businesses for food handling violations, is now making it clear that his office is not looking to play the role of COVID-19 rule enforcer.


  Though acknowledging during a meeting in May that he is obligated to investigate citizen complaints, the Board of Health and Stoneham Town Administrator Dennis Sheehan have made clear their top priority is helping businesses survive.


  “We’re concerned about our businesses in town and want to make sure [we’re] doing what we can to help them reopen,” said Stoneham Town Administrator Dennis Sheehan, when Phase I of the reopening plan began last month. “The town is really not looking to do any kind of enforcement [beyond what’s mandated].”

Over the years we’ve heard about some pretty heavy-duty MP3 players, but the new Astell & Kern A&futura SE200 might just take the cake in terms of over- the-top performance.


  That's because the A&futura SE200, which was announced on Thursday, is the world’s first dual-DAC music player, according to the company.


  The included DACs are the Sabre ESS9068AS DACs from ESS and a AKM4499EQ from AKM that was most recently featured in Astell & Kern’s top-of-the-line SP2000 player.


  In terms of other specs, the SE200 has 256GB of storage with support for up to 1TB of extra storage via its microSD card slot, as well as aptX HD Bluetooth wireless, and 32-bit/384kHz file playback.


  It also comes at a steep, steep price of £1,799 / $1,799 (around AU$2,600), putting it on par with a Razer Blade Laptop or a 65-inch Samsung QLED TV.


  ## It’s a double DAC attack


  For those unfamiliar with them, DAC stands for Digital-to-Analog converter - i.e. the piece of technology inside every audio-producing electronic that turns digital files into analog sound.


  DACs are found in pretty much everything from your laptop to your smartphone, from your iPad to your favorite pair of wireless earbuds. So they’re actually pretty important.


  That being said, most DACs are usually good enough at their jobs to create crisp, clean sound when paired with the right amplifier but at the high end it becomes more about personal preference in audio quality… something that may or may not be totally perceptible to the average listener.


  It's obvious that Astell & Kern is targeting distinguished audiophiles who can pick out the difference between DACs and while it might sound a bit like snake oil to some, it's definitely a unique gimmick if nothing else.

 Village of White Pigeon water customers could end up paying $24 more per quarter than originally predicted as a result of an upcoming, system-wide upgrade.
   
 That figure is three-times the amount project officials first estimated.
   
 During a special village council meeting Thursday, Ken Jones, of South Bend- based Jones, Petrie, Rafinski Corp. engineering, explained the potential increase was the result of a status designation the village did not receive.
   
 "The guys from PFM (financial advisors) had developed some preliminary rates based on project-cost estimate and also based on the typical structure for the (Michigan Clean Water State Revolving Funds) loan agreement, which included designation for the village as a disadvantaged community," he said. "And we had been, and continue to be, counting on that through the entire process … it wasn't until more recently that we found out that we weren't going to be (designated) a disadvantaged community."
   
 Jones said he felt the information was critical enough to warrant Thursday's special meeting. Despite the news, Jones advised the village to continue moving forward with the undertaking.
   
 He said the project's rate consultant had anticipated White Pigeon's water customers would see an $8-per-quarter rate increase to cover debt from a 30-year loan related to financing the infrastructure upgrade.
   
 Jones said communities of a "disadvantaged" status typically experience a rate hike within that range following a waterline-replacement project.
   
 "As the project progressed and we more recently discovered you weren't going to be designated a disadvantaged community, none of those benefits applied, so the loan went from 30 years to 20 years and there's no principle forgiveness," he said. "What that means is that's a $16-per-quarter increase over that $8. So, the debt obligation for this loan went from $8 to $24 per quarter."
   
 He said the village's current residential rates - $4 per 1,000 gallons - are the lowest in the region. Residents are also charged a flat-rate commodity charge of $23 per quarter and a small debt-service charge that is expected to retire soon.
   
 Jones said an average home will use 6,400 gallons of water a month. Based on that amount and with the potential new figures factored in, it equates to about an additional $43 per month.
   
 "That's going to be higher than a lot of your customers are currently paying … the only thing I can say in consolation is it's still significantly lower than almost every community that I'm aware of," he said. "I think the loan is still a good deal, we're still getting a good interest rate and at some point in time, there's going to be an impact to rates, regardless."
   
 In fact, Jones said the village's water rates are so low, he speculated that may have factored into the decision to not designate White Pigeon as a disadvantaged community.
   
 He elaborated on the thought.
   
 "Your median income per household is in the low $40,000s, which would be considered not poverty but kind of right in the middle," he said. "But your water rates are so low, the way I think the state is looking at it is 'Your customers can afford it.' So, that's why other communities that have higher rates with your same income demographic probably did get the disadvantage status and you didn't."
   
 Jones said the first phase of the project is set to go out to bid in the next week and he reiterated that village officials should continue moving forward with the plan.
   
 Optimistically, he said as the project enters its second and third phases, there's a possibility White Pigeon could achieve "disadvantaged community" status because of the rate increase created by the first phase.
   
 Phase one involves a 10-inch water main from the Grand Elk Railroad line east along U.S. 12 to the White Pigeon's eastern village limits.
   
 Potentially sporting a price tag of at least $14 million, the task involves replacing the village's water line infrastructure, most of which is estimated to be more than 70 years old. Evidence of its age has included frequent situations of leaks, low pressure and occasional boil-water orders. Village officials acknowledge the situation will get worse over time if the infrastructure is left as is.
   
 Village president Tyler Royce said pulling the trigger on the upgrade is the right thing to do, despite the resulting increased rates.
   
 "It's an unfortunate situation for the village as a whole, but we've stepped up to the plate and made the decision to do something about it," he said. "Hopefully, in many years to come, the folks aren't going to be in as bad of a situation as we are now if we do the right thing today."
   
 The first phase is set to begin this fall, while the second and third phases will involve work on the north end of town first, followed by the final phase covering the south side of the village, in 2021 and 2022.
   
 Jones said though White Pigeon's water customers have probably enjoyed such low rates through the years, that has come at a cost to the village.
   
 "Keeping the rates as low as you have, you haven't been able to put away a spending fund for capital works and you've had to defer maintenance on a lot of things because you just don't have the money," Jones said. "Still, it's hard to explain to somebody, 'Well, you've had this benefit for the last 20 years of very, very low rates, and now we just can't do it anymore.'"

At the end of that central path is a magnificent old apple tree, surrounded by an 80-foot circle of lawn, because the drip line of the apple tree is circular. Flowers in curved beds surround the lawn. As Mary Hayward said, “Curves need to make sense.” Most of the paths and lines in their garden beds are straight, only occasionally curving or meandering to go around a fixed feature.


  “Pay attention to views from the doors and windows because they’ll suggest garden placement,” said Gordon. Look out them, make sure what you see pleases you. Not only that, he said you gain confidence in your design if you pay attention to the house. There needs to be a relationship between the house and the garden spaces. “The garden is an extension of the house and the people in it,” he said.


  What else should one consider? The north-south orientation is important, Gordon said. You can grow roses on the south side of a barn, for example, but not on the north side, as there is much less sun. Where is sunset? Most of us like to rest at the end of a day in the garden to watch the sun go down. You can design that – and maybe steal a view of distant hills owned by others. You may need a chain saw to accomplish that.


  Mary Hayward grew up near Hidcote Manor Garden, one of England’s finest old gardens, and visited often when growing up. Those visits shaped her view of how a garden should look: a series of connected rooms. Gordon Hayward grew up on apple orchard, and so he wanted apple trees on his landscape as an adult. It makes sense to have elements of a garden that resonate with each person, based on personal history.


  “Every decorative element in a garden should have a story, a reason,” Gordon said. “Don’t go buy a cute elephant. Consider what your grandmother or grandfather had.” In the long run, that will resonate with you better.

And with the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics estimating that some 40 million citizens are now out-of-work — a figure which accounts for the stunning 16 percent unemployment rate for Massachusetts’ workforce — it’s hard to imagine the economic stakes being higher.


  “I think it’s a matter of trying to rise above all the stress and collaborate together,” said Egan, who has been inspired by the local business community’s ability to stay upbeat and overcome adversity. “If we want them to survive, we have to be flexible. People are [facing overwhelming financial troubles] and many haven’t had income since March.”


  “Shop local,” Egan later urged citizens. “I know you’ve heard that so many times it doesn’t really resonate anymore, but it’s so important now.”


  In recent weeks, the state has slowly allowed local merchants to serve food at area restaurants and allow customers back inside their small shops, but with a plethora of attached conditions and industry-specific caveats.


  Responding contrary to government’s reputation of being slow-moving and inflexible, local officials in The Middlesex East coverage area have swiftly emerged with offers of assistance. Not only able to interpret and enact local reopening guidelines in response to the state directives within days, leaders in cities and towns like Woburn, Winchester, Stoneham, and Reading have also jumped at the chance to help small businesses understand the COVID-19 regulations.


  For example, in Stoneham, the Select Board has held multiple meetings over the past few weeks in order to process applications from at least seven restaurateurs looking to open emergency outdoor dining areas on public property.


  With Stoneham Square’s sidewalks making it difficult to accommodate seating due to American Disability Act regulations, town officials are also examining the possibility of allowing seating within parallel parking spaces along Route 28 or even on the Town Common.


  Lastly, the Select Board has waived all hours-of-operation restrictions on existing site plan and liquor license approvals, which is enabling merchants to stay open seven days a week until 11 p.m.


  “Obviously, whatever we can do, especially in light of what these businesses have been through,” said Select Board member George Seibold, who recently offered to personally assist any Stoneham business owner set up fencing areas and jersey barriers around new outdoor seating areas. “When it comes to this, I’m hoping to be a little more flexible than normal. I want to be as lenient as possible.”


  In nearby Woburn, the city’s License Commission weeks ago delegated emergency powers to Mayor Scott Galvin to approve outdoor seating areas, including temporary liquor license applications from restaurants eyeing the use of public spaces like sidewalks and parking lots.


  Earlier this month, Reading’s Select Board, interpreting the state’s reopening plan to require a public hearing for outdoor liquor licenses and seating areas in public spaces, scrambled to convene those gatherings and okay pending applications. Already, the Venetian Moon, a popular Reading Center eatery, has been given permission to erect an semi-permanent tent structure in a public parking area off of Main Street, while six other local eateries have also had temporary outdoor dining areas okayed.


  “The town approved that in eight days. So I think people realize [these businesses] need support. They need it now more than ever,” said Egan, referring to Reading’s approach to the Venetian Moon site plan and other reopening requests.


  In a model being eyed by Stoneham, Winchester has also okayed outdoor seating areas within public parking spaces in its downtown areas, so long as that off- street eating area is blocked off by jersey barriers.


  Hard to interpret


  At the outset of this week, the state, which in early May unveiled a four- phase economic reopening plan, green-lighted the beginning of what authorities have labeled step two of Phase II.


  Under the continued loosening of business restrictions, close-contact personal service establishments — such as nail salons, massage parlors, and body-piercing studios — were allowed to open their doors to customers for the first time since mid-March.

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Alaska's largest city will begin requiring masks in certain public settings, Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz said Friday, calling it an act of community responsibility amid the coronavirus pandemic.


  The order, set to take effect Monday, will apply to indoor public settings, particularly where maintaining distance can be difficult, such as restaurants, bars, stores and public transit, he said. There will be exceptions, including for young children, people with health issues and people for whom wearing a mask would impair their ability to carry out a duty, Berkowitz said.


  Further details were expected to be released later Friday.


  “I'm hoping that we will continue to do the right thing, because it is the right thing," Berkowitz said. The requirements will be difficult to enforce, he said. “But that's true of pretty much all the rules that a society has. … And we count on one another to make sure that we uphold these community standards.”


  He said there has been a lot of talk of the rights that people have when it comes to wearing masks. "I'm just astounded by the number of constitutional scholars and epidemiologists that exist in our community," he said, adding that if people don't want to wear a mask for themselves, they should wear one for others.


  He said he considered this an intermediate step as reported case counts rise. He said he does not want to return to a hunker-down phase, noting the economic consequences could be “fairly profound.”


  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining physical distance from others is difficult. The state has encouraged — but not mandated — use of face coverings.

The owner of Outlaws Longview Bar is defying a statewide Gov. Greg Abbott issued to shut down bars beginning noon Friday because of a surge of COVID-19 cases.
 "We're open," bar owner Melissa Lynn Kelly said at her East Marshall Avenue establishment within two hours after the order went into effect. "We have moved our bar outside as much as we can."
 Kelly said the bar was not selling beer or wine but would accept donations from patrons. She said she will maintain business hours of staying open until midnight, unless an authority enforces Abbott's order to shut her down.
 Other bars in Longview appeared to be obeying Abbott's order.
 Abbott on Friday took his most drastic steps to counter the new coronavirus surge that followed his decision to reopen the economy in early May. His order on Friday also scaled back restaurant capacity from 75 to 50% and shut down river-rafting trips.
 "At this time,it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars," Abbott said in a news release. "The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain the virus and protect public health."
 Kelly defied the initial order that shut bars effective midnight March 20 by reopening Outlaws Longview at 4 p.m. May 15, a week before Abbott allowed bars to open back up and at 25% capacity.
 She cited the financial hardships she and the bartenders suffered from being closed about two months and said she has not received a loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration. She drew about 40 patrons who mostly gathered outside, and limited 18 people at a time inside the bar to adhere to 25% capacity.
 Kelly said representatives from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission have visited her bar five times since then.
 "They have not found any rules that I have broken," Kelly said. "They have been totally happy with me."
 TABC spokesman Chris Porter was unavailable for comment Friday afternoon regarding Kelly and enforcing Abbott's order.
 Kelly said, "I am not going down easy. I am going down with a fight. If I shut down after being shut down, I might as well turn in my license."
 It remained to be seen as of Friday afternoon whether Longview police or TABC would shut the bar down, take other legal action or both,
 "This is the first I have heard about it," Longview police officer Brandon Thorton said Friday afternoon. He called back shortly and said, "We are in the process of reviewing the governor's order."
 Thornton said that if a violation occurs, "we will work with TABC on a plan" to enforce Abbott's order.
 Longview Mayor Andy Mack was unavailable for comment Friday afternoon. City officials declined to city or shut down Kelly's bar after she reopened May

"I think the evidence on the value of masks continues to grow," said Malcolm. "It's been one of the things that has frankly changed, over the course of the pandemic -- what we knew about masks and how valuable of a tool we thought they were. As the evidence has continued to get stronger about the benefits of mask-wearing, we certainly have always urged that, and strongly recommended it as we look to further reopenings."


  "I know it is a logical question if ... actually making it a requirement for certain settings might make a logical companion to the reopenings," Malcolm said. "A number of localities have taken that initiative on their own, and that's certainly something we have been supportive of as well."


  Currently, 16 states have issued orders requiring the use of masks in public places indoors and often outdoors if persons cannot maintain a distance of 6 feet.


  Minneapolis and St. Paul mayors have ordered the wearing of masks indoors in public places and outdoors where distance cannot be maintained. The state of Minnesota has requirements for wearing masks in certain businesses, but aside for customers of personal care services, the public is currently under no requirements to cover their mouth and nose in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.


  'We know that the governor has said many times for this to work, Minnesotans have to buy in and adopt these behaviors," Malcolm said. "We also understand saying something is required does matter. We're talking about that, and looking at that quite closely as we notice that more states and cities around the country are going to a requirement."

For starters, the Robeson County 4-H Program is the first in the state of North Carolina to have an app. I guess you could say, we are the first to plant the seed. We needed to plant this seed, because about a year ago, the state switched to a new online registration system for 4-H, which meant getting rid of the paperwork. On one hand this is great, because it takes a lot of room for storage and sometimes chasing folks down to fill out the paperwork becomes a logistical nightmare for everyone involved. Now everyone can register for 4-H from the convenience of their computers or mobile devices. It's a great system except for one little thing, when we send out an email, the system sometimes drops the email addresses with no rhyme or reason. That makes communicating difficult. We used our blog, emails, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Remind. That became too difficult for people to find and for us to continue generating. We did what we teach our youth to do and problem solved. Hence the app. On the 4-H app, not only can you see what is going on, you can get push notifications as reminders and see all of our social media with the touch of a button.

  Under an executive order signed by Mass. Governor Charles Baker early on during the COVID-19 crisis, a series of permitting deadlines and associated public hearing timelines were waived in light of restrictions on large gatherings and workplace shutdowns.

The upcoming college football season is no certainty, given the recent rising numbers associated with COVID-19, but local high school graduates are still preparing for their first season at a higher level.


   


  There were no shortage of football players in Southeastern North Carolina who signed to play college football this fall. The StarNews caught up with four of them to discuss what their offseason workouts have been like, and when they might report to their for formal practices.


   


  West Brunswick's J'vian McCray (East Carolina)


   


  The StarNews All-Area Defensive Player of the Year was the lone local player who enrolled early and spent the spring semester, before COVID-19 canceled classes, at his school.


   


  "It was a lot of fun, but it was definitely tough," McCray said. "The workouts are a whole lot different than high school with how fast you are working out and moving from one station to the other."


   


  McCray said he enjoyed his time back in Shallotte, but wished he was able to stay in Greenville and build more comfort on campus. While home, McCray tried to get out and run, do field work and lift dumbbells every day. He had guidance from ECU, but also implemented a lot of his own workouts.


   


  McCray is now back in Greenville, but before reuniting with his teammates in person he attended Zoom conferences every Tuesday and Thursday with the entire defense. They added new plays and went over team concepts.


   


  On campus, McCray says he will need to go through testing and a short period of quarantine before getting back on the field with his teammates.


   


  New Hanover's Mikai Stanley and Hoggard's Chris Redmon (Western Carolina)


   


  Best friends here, Stanley and Redmon will now share four years together in Cullowhee playing college football. Stanley will play running back for the Catamounts, while Redmon will remain on the defensive line.


   


  The Wilmington duo has also been working out together here while getting ready for their upcoming college careers.


   


  "It's been tough to find a field and weight room at times, but Mikai and I will go out running and doing a bunch of body weight stuff together whenever we can," Redmon said. "Working a bunch on our footwork, running sprints, and then trying to work on our positions as much as we can."


   


  Western Carolina sent both a packet of workouts just after February's Signing Day. Stanley said he uses the packet as good guidelines, but likes to challenge himself even more by adding extra workouts. He even recently purchased a mask to prepare for the higher elevation (2,116 feet above sea level).


   


  "I know what gets me in shape. It's been tough going through all this, but one thing I will always be able to do is challenge myself to get better," he said.


   


  There are bi-weekly online team meetings preparing for the upcoming season. Stanley doesn't yet know when he will be reporting to campus, but Redmon knows he won't arrive at Western until January. The coronavirus has put a pause on his arrival, but he will still enroll and take online classes this fall.


   


  Cody Wallis, Topsail (Campbell)


   


  The Hampstead gunslinger is all-in on the Camels off-season workout plans.


   


  Wallis couldn't hide his excitement in talking about how Campbell uses an app to send their athletes a workout each day. It's then the players' jobs to complete the workout -- and provide a video or photo.


   


  "We all split up into different groups and we're competing. Doing extra workouts, body weight pictures and keeping up with each other helps add points," Wallis said. "Whoever has the most points gets some extra Campbell workout clothes. I'm enjoying how we're already breeding competition."


   


  Even without the team, Wallis is learning how important recovery is to a college athlete. He's gotten into yoga, and for the first time is spending time focusing on stretching.


   


  Soon, he will start learning the playbook over Zoom with the quarterbacks coach. Originally, Wallis was supposed to arrive in Buies Creek on Aug. 6, but that date is now up in the air.

But despite the work he had put in, he still found himself without a job just weeks ago. The Texas AirHogs, the American Association team he had signed with and played for last year, decided it would not be operating this season.


  For a week, the outfielder was jobless. And then the St. Paul Saints called. He got the call last weekend and after two full days of packing, he said goodbye to his wife and hit the road Tuesday morning, en route to Minnesota.


  “It’s tough but we got through it,” Byrd said. “And it’s all worth it once you get out here. It makes every bit of it worth it.”


  That’s the sentiment from the Saints, who began their “spring training,” on Thursday after months of wondering whether they would even have a chance to return to the field. Minor League Baseball does not yet have a plan to return. Six of the 12 teams in the American Association won’t play this year. Other independent leagues are having trouble launching, too.

All told, 40 competitors will run a combined 270 laps, (675 miles), with the exact car and engine.

_I recognized when I entered the mandatory mask order that there would be people who would not like it.  What I didn’t expect was the level of pure hatred and profanity laden messages that would make a sailor blush. That’s okay, it comes with the territory. What has been most disappointing to me has been the level of insistence by many that my orders are a direct affront to their constitutional rights. The U.S. Supreme Court, since 1794, after the Whiskey Rebellion, and times since has repeatedly held that these types of orders are allowed in certain circumstances and are, in fact, constitutional. Those who say otherwise are misinformed or are depending on Natural law, not Constitutional law. I have not asked people to lay down their arms, surrender their right to free speech or to be subject to having soldiers quartered in their homes, I’ve asked them to suffer the inconvenience of placing a 4x6” piece of material over their mouth and nose when in a business to protect their friends and neighbors.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has joined three other U.S. senators in sending a letter to Amtrak President and CEO William Flynn calling for assurances that a planned long-distance train service reduction to three-day-a-week operations beginning this fall will be temporary.


  Amtrak announced earlier this month that daily long-distance train routes will be reduced to three-day-a-week service, effective Oct. 1, in response to a steep drop in ridership during the coronavirus pandemic.


  Amtrak’s current routes with three-day-a-week service, the Cardinal and the Sunset Limited, will remain on those schedules.


  “We are very troubled by this proposal, and ask that you provide additional information as well as a commitment to return to full service when the pandemic draws to a close,” the letter states. “Passenger rail service is a critical component of the U.S. transportation network, providing an efficient means of connecting cities and towns across the country.”


  It continues, “Long-distance service allows us to bring tourists, businesses, and families to communities like Havre [Mon.], Elko [Nev.], and Prince [W.Va.], providing gateways to our states.”


  In a statement, Manchin said, “This proposed change is worrisome for many Americans who rely on the long-distance services for travel. We gave Amtrak more money to protect essential services just like this. It’s time they get on board with a commitment and a detailed timeline for resumption of seven-day-a- week service on long-distance routes across America.”

 Ocala Police detectives have arrested a Belleview man and accuse him of shooting another man in the chest early Friday.
 Jesse Lee Pettrey was arrested on a charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon by Detective Michael Coughlin and booked into the Marion County Jail.
 Jail records showed the 23-year-old man was released Friday afternoon after posting a $10,000 bond.
 Police said they were called to a shooting at 2:03 a.m. in front of a night spot on the downtown square.
 Multiple witnesses told Coughlin that a man was causing a disturbance on the square. During the commotion, witnesses said, the man and a second man began arguing. During the confrontation, Pettrey and his friend joined in the altercation.
 The man accused of starting the disturbance was escorted away from the crowd along South Magnolia Avenue, according to the witnesses. Pettrey and his friend saw the man being pulled away, went to him, and an argument began.
 Pettrey's friend was heard telling the man who ignited the disturbance that Prettrey is a federal bounty hunter with the authority to arrest or possibly shoot him, police said.
 The detective was told there were other disturbances and Pettrey was seen going to a vehicle. Witnesses thought he was going for a firearm. Pettrey threatened a man, later identified as the victim, to a fight, but the victim refused, witnesses told police.
 The victim punched Pettrey in the back of the head and Pettrey pulled out a Smith and Wesson from his waist and shot the victim once in the chest, witnesses said. Pettrey then got in a vehicle and it drove away.
 Officers found the vehicle, a Jeep Wrangler, at South Magnolia and Southeast Fourth Street. Pettrey, who was in the vehicle, told an officer he messed up and wanted to pray.
 An officer found the gun allegedly used by Pettrey not far from where the vehicle was stopped.
 Pettrey was taken to the Ocala Police Department, where he was interviewed by Coughlin.
 During the interview, police say, Pettrey said he was punched in the back of the head multiple times by the victim and that his shirt was ripped. He said he loaded his gun and shot the victim in the chest.
 Pettrey told the detective he was scared and thought the crowd was going to beat him up.
 He was told that his statement does not match the evidence of where the shell casing was found and what witnesses had to say.

But ultimately, the reason why America continues to struggle in addressing the pandemic is its leadership crisis. With the federal government’s response in disarray and numerous governors in states such as Texas, Florida, Arizona, and Nevada under fire for their crisis response, Americans are left looking for leadership from public health officials, many of whom are being deterred from speaking more publicly about the crisis. As a result, the country finds itself once again in an information deficit regarding the deadly virus and its consequences for the nation.

The bureau has struggled to combat the pandemic behind bars, where social distancing is nearly impossible, and has increasingly relied on home confinement to try to clear cramped quarters and reduce the chance of infection for high-risk inmates.

 Federal authorities accused her of double-selling the books, keeping many for self-promotion purposes and failing to deliver them to institutions they were purchased for, including Baltimore City Public Schools. Pugh used the proceeds to fund straw donations to her mayoral campaign and to buy and renovate a house.
 Pugh last week also pleaded guilty to a state perjury charge for failing to disclose a business interest relating to her children’s books on her financial disclosure forms when she was a state senator. She was sentenced to six months in jail to be served concurrently with her federal sentence.

CNN) -- Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Friday that the White House coronavirus task force is "seriously considering" pool testing for Covid-19 and acknowledged to The Washington Post that the Trump administration's current testing strategy has proven inadequate.


  The proposal is still in the discussion stage, Fauci told CNN, and it was not announced at a task force press briefing on Friday afternoon.


  Although President Donald Trump has repeatedly downplayed the need for increased testing -- and suggested last week that he asked for testing to be slowed down -- the nation is experiencing a surge in confirmed cases, demonstrating the nation's inability thus far to get a grip on the spiraling pandemic.

The entire press went ballistic when Donald Trump posed in front of St. John’s Church—known historically as the “church of presidents,” while holding up a Bible. It was an identical pose, in the exact same spot, that Bill Clinton struck in a photograph several years ago. Police had fired tear gas in an effort to clear a crowd, so that Trump could walk freely to the church. While the president was castigated for this, little mention was made of the fact that he was posing in front of a church that had been damaged by protesters. Washington Bishop Mariann Budde reserved criticism for the president exclusively, dismissing the damage to the church as minimal, and calling Trump’s actions “an excruciating moment.” Budde also declared that Trump “is not entitled to use the symbolism to promote an entirely different message” from the protesting “people of color.”

“For me, it's back to seeing the police officers walking in the neighborhoods, not policing, just checking in to see how everyone is doing,” Reed said. “That’s what it takes to trust each other.”


  One of his next steps was to go through the department’s policies and procedures.


  “We revised some and created new ones,” English said.


  For example, he said, after he spoke with those at a protest last month, he changed the use-of-force policy to state that if an officer sees another officer use too much force, they are required to intervene.


  Three officers in the Floyd case stood and watched for more than eight minutes as he slowly died.


  English said that following the protest, he reviewed the policy and was shocked that some things weren’t included.


  “I thought we had had it in there,” he said. “After the protest, I went back and read it and it wasn’t in there. So I added it. I also added a sanctity of life statement.”


  Reed said English has shown he wants to improve the department.


  “He wants to listen to people and get better,” Reed said. “He took those suggestions and made those changes.”


  Reed said she would like to think that Harrisonburg’s officers would intervene regardless if there was a policy that said they had to do so.


  “You would hope that, but now, to put that in policy, you know it is what HPD expects,” she said.


  English also created an intelligence unit.


  “We just don’t look at things locally, we look at things nationally so we can keep our finger on the pulse,” said English, adding that his team is looking at national cases and learning from them. “We’re going to go through these scenarios. We want everyone to be on the same page on how HPD stands on these issues.”


  If one of those scenarios happens here, English has a new use-of-force review board made up of both police officers and community members to review each incident. It’s one of several panels English set up to review conduct and policies.


  Baugh said it’s a good thing to get a variety of eyes on different situations and policies.


  “These things are revolving processes,” he said. “That’s why the input is good.”


  Additionally, at the protest, some questioned the transparency on use-of- force statistics. In years past, protesters said, they would have to spend several hundred dollars on FOIA requests to get information they wanted.


  English said that was the last time they’d have to fork out money for use-of- force data. Within days, that information was posted on the police department’s website.


  Before, he said, officers had to deal with old computer systems that required them to go through and read each report and calculate data. Now, it’s been streamlined, making it easier to report data in a more efficient manner.


  “I think it’s important for individuals to know what’s going on in their community,” he said.

L'enseigne américaine de prêt-à-porter Gap a conclu un partenariat avec la marque Yeezy du rappeur et producteur Kanye West et va lancer une ligne dédiée en 2021, une nouvelle qui a fait bondir l'action vendredi.

  Selon le New York Times, l'accord porte sur dix ans. Contacté par l'AFP, Gap a refusé de communiquer la durée de ce partenariat mais affirmé que l'information du New York Times était fausse.


  La collaboration dépasse le cadre d'une collection unique, comme en ont proposé de très nombreuses enseignes ces dernières années avec des créateurs célèbres.


  Outre une ligne pour hommes, femmes et enfants, "à des prix accessibles", Kanye West définira des visuels propres en magasins et sur le site du groupe, selon un communiqué publié vendredi.


  C'est un coup marketing majeur pour Gap, qui peine depuis plusieurs années à rester pertinent dans le paysage du prêt-à-porter, en pleine mutation.


  Début 2019, le groupe avait annoncé la fermeture d'environ 230 magasins après avoir enregistré une baisse de 5% de son chiffre d'affaires en 2018.


  Le groupe a un peu redressé la tête en 2019, mais le chiffre d'affaires de la seule marque Gap a lui affiché un repli, de 10%.


  Le groupe possède également le label à bas coûts Old Navy, qui résiste plutôt mieux, et l'enseigne moyenne gamme Banana Republic.


  La crise du coronavirus a frappé de plein fouet la maison créée en 1969 à San Francisco et divisé les ventes de la marque Gap par deux. Le groupe a clôturé la période sur une perte nette de près d'un milliard de dollars (932 millions de dollars).


  En s'alliant à Kanye West, Gap s'offre l'une des marques les plus en vue du moment, très prisée des jeunes.


  Rappeur et producteur à succès, ce créateur atypique a entamé des collaborations dans la mode au milieu des années 2000, et lancé sa première ligne de baskets Yeezy avec Nike en 2007.


  Il a ensuite rompu avec l'équipementier américain en 2013, estimant insuffisante sa part des revenus.


  La collaboration entre Adidas et Kanye West, entamée en 2014, a permis de développer la marque Yeezy, dont les ventes ont explosé, pour atteindre environ 1,5 milliard de dollars en 2019, selon le magazine Forbes.


  Parallèlement, Kanye West a présenté huit collections de vêtements Yeezy, financées par Adidas mais aux volumes faibles par rapport aux baskets.


  Le succès de Yeezy a permis à l'enfant de Chicago d'être reconnu comme milliardaire par le magazine Forbes en avril dernier.


  Plus inspirateur que réellement couturier, Kanye West s'est attaché les services de la créatrice londonienne d'origine nigériane Mowalola Ogunlesi (25 ans), nommée directrice du design de YZY GAP, selon un tweet du rappeur.


  Sa mode assez radicale qui révèle beaucoup du corps, déjà aperçue à la fashion week de Londres, est a priori en assez net décalage avec le côté confortable et passe-partout de l'univers Gap.

I recently had one of those moments that reminded me exactly why I chose to work for county conservation. It was one of those moments that makes you smile so big and makes your heart swell so much that my wife noticed even without me saying anything.


   


  It was the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. I had taken my wife and two kids, ages almost-five and almost-two, out on Big Hollow Lake for a boat ride. We brought fishing poles but teaching two young children to fish is like trying to teach yoga to bear cubs. And by bear cubs I mean the kind with ADHD and a strong penchant for energy drinks. Or at least I think that's what it's probably like. I've never done yoga.


   


  So we took to motoring around on the lake which the bear cubs enjoyed enough to stop fighting with each other. As we headed toward the lake dam, just past the beach, I noticed an awful lot of color on the lake ahead. By the time we got to the big open part of the lake just below the campground, I was able to see the full spectacle of what has been one of my proudest park leader moments in recent memory.


   


  Dozens and dozens of kayaks dotted the lake from one shore to the other. Kayaks of all colors. And paddlers ranging in age from quite young to not young at all, and with physical statures ranging from gym rat to that of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. And I'm absolutely not poking fun here. That demographic range is precisely what triggered the proud-of-my-job moment.


   


  See, we had recently installed a kayak launch dock at the lake. It's basically a floating walkway with a platform just above the water line where you can place your kayak and get into it without it bobbing in the water or rocking back and forth on the edge of the shore like kayaks tend to do. Then when you're fully seated, you hook your paddle in the dock's grooves on either side of the launch platform and slide off into the water. It's really quite handy.


   


  We knew the lake was a popular paddling destination so we figured a dock like that would be convenient for our frequent paddlers. So, as with most everything at that park, we paid for it with grants and donations and assembled and installed it with our own staff labor.


   


  But what happened next surprised us all. People started coming in droves. Local retailers couldn't keep kayaks in their stores. They were literally selling them by the truckload. A local sporting goods retailer said they field probably 20 calls a day from people asking if they have any kayaks in stock. Most of the time they don't.


   


  Now I'm sure our dock isn't the only driving force behind that increase in kayak sales. Recreational kayaking, after all, is the fastest growing outdoor rec sport in the nation. But the economic impact is not what makes me so proud to head up this organization.


   


  I have since received several reports from people in awe of the number of kayaks on that lake. One of my board members counted seventy-five kayaks from where he stood on the shore one Saturday afternoon.


   


  "You could have walked across the lake stepping from one kayak to another," said one of our Park Rangers after a particularly busy weekend.


   


  One of our main goals at Des Moines County Conservation is to create places that, by sheer merit of their existence, draw people outdoors. That kayak launch dock wasn't so much a convenience for pre-existing paddlers, I realize now. It was a gateway to a lake and the outdoor recreation opportunities it provides. That dock removed a barrier for a lot of people that otherwise might not have taken up kayaking. That dock makes it possible for the young, old, and not-so-physically-fit to exercise while enjoying the outdoors in such a way that only a quiet paddle on a lake can offer.


   


  I love working with people that live to connect others to the outdoors. It wasn't me that put that dock there. My staff did that. They raised the money, secured the grants, coordinated the delivery, assembled the parts and put it all in place. I'm just the one that, hopefully, inspires them enough to keep improving our parks like this.


   


  That was my epiphany that day on the lake with my family. That lake, the line of paddlers in line to use its new dock, and the diversity of people paddling around on it exemplified why I get out of bed every day.


   


  "Proud boss moment, huh?" My wife said, reading my smile as I piloted the boat that day. A proud boss moment is was, for sure.

Blackwell immediately came under fire for fatally shooting a man in 2002.


  According to police at the time, Jeramy O. Gilliam pointed a gun at Blackwell, who swept Gilliam’s arm to the side and then grappled with him. While they wrestled, Blackwell — fearing for his life — fired his own gun into Gilliam’s back, police officials contended.


  The encounter unfolded after police responded for a report of a burglary and Blackwell saw Gilliam walking in the 2300 block of Idlewood Avenue, roughly three blocks from a burglary scene, according to Times-Dispatch coverage of the incident. Blackwell asked to see Gilliam’s identification, though he didn’t match the description of the suspect, before Gilliam reportedly pointed the gun at Blackwell.

All 2020 RC Fs receive refreshed front and rear bumpers, headlights, and taillights, plus Michelin Pilot Sport 4S summer tires in place of the previous Pilot Super Sports. Our test car also featured the optional torque-vectoring differential (TVD), which is a $1250 more than the standard Torsen limited- slip diff. Although Lexus's engineers preferred the directness of the standard rear end for the RC F Track Edition, we've already proven that the TVD setup is the quicker way to go in the regular model. The system has three settings (Standard, Slalom, and Track) that are controlled via a button on the center console, with Track providing the most noticeable improvement to the car's agility, especially on corner exits. Aided by the new Michelins, our example posted 0.98 g of grip around the skidpad, which is up from the previous model's 0.95 g. However, its so-so 163-foot stop from 70 mph is nine feet longer than before.

The RC F's Sport drive mode is our preferred setup for spirited cruising, as it maintains a luxury-car comportment yet slightly sharpens the responses of the drivetrain and brings a bit more engine and exhaust noise versus the standard setting. You have to step up to Sport+ for the RC F to feel athletic. Regardless of the mode, the eight-speed transmission shifts quickly and smoothly, although the V-8's dearth of torque at low rpm can cause the gearbox to hunt for the best gear ratio. To keep the V-8 on boil through corners, we often found ourselves manually tapping the responsive shift paddles on the back of the steering wheel. While we never tired of winding out the RC F's engine, doing so did drop our average fuel economy to 16 mpg, the same as the EPA's city estimate. Cruising on our 75-mph highway loop returned a far more impressive 27 mpg, which is 3 mpg better than its federal highway rating.


  The RC F's drive modes also control its adaptive dampers, which offer a considerable range of ride stiffness. The Sport+ setting produces a lot of vertical heaving on poorly maintained roads, but overall ride comfort and body control are excellent. There's no hiding the RC F's girth on a twisty back road, but stiffer bushings for the rear subframe and the electrically assisted steering rack do help it feel more precise over undulations and quick transitions.

That leaves the Saints especially thankful to be back on the field — even if they’re going to have to start their season away from their home park. The Saints are scheduled to play a 60-game season beginning on July 3; for the time being, they will play their home games in front of some fans in Sioux Falls, S.D.


  “This (has) obviously been the longest offseason for everyone with everything that’s happened with the COVID-19 and it’s been rough for everybody but … guys are excited to be back here,” manager George Tsamis said.


  The Saints don’t plan on returning home to CHS Field in St. Paul until they get approval to host games with fans in the stands. Unlike Major League Baseball, which plans to play games without fans in attendance, the Saints do not have a lucrative television deal and need to play with paying customers in attendance for financial reasons.


  “We’re hopeful that soon we’re allowed to play home games, and for now we’re just going to kind of focus on the fact that we’re playing baseball,” pitcher Brian Glowicki said. “There’s not a lot of people playing baseball right now, so regardless of where we have to play, we’re just excited for the opportunity.”


  Glowicki signed with the Saints recently after being released by the Cubs. The former University of Minnesota pitcher had been training in the Twin Cities after leaving Cubs spring training in Arizona in March.

Paul Alfred Lage Sparks - 1940 - 2020 At the age of 79. Paul, one of the kindest and gentlest souls to all of his family and friends, with a heart of gold, passed away on Saturday, June 20, 2020. Paul and his twin brother Steve were born to Gertrude Kiljunen Lage and Charles Lage in San Francisco on August 23, 1940. The family moved between California, Moose Pass Alaska and Reno following Charles Lage's work as a Journeyman pipe fitter and plumber. In 1951 the family returned to Anchorage for five years, but made their final move to Reno in 1956. Paul's passion for cars started as a young teen. He and twin Brother Steve drove from Alaska to Reno in a car they had built. They joined the Dominators car club and were members of the Vagabonds, where they met lifelong friends. Paul graduated from Reno High in 1958 and attended the University of Nevada Reno for two years. Later, because of his ground-breaking work, his supervisors at DRI would convince the University to award Paul an honorary engineering degree to advance him to Professional status. Paul worked for 29 years as an electrical engineer/researcher for the University of Nevada Reno - Desert Research Institute where he traveled the world, including a 5 day travel from South America on a motorized wooden boat called the Hero to Palmer Station Antarctica, where he helped install the first meteorological base. He also traveled to Puerto Rico and New Zealand on atmospheric study projects. He worked on cloud seeding and Doppler radar systems where he flew into the eye of hurricanes. He later went on to consult with Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), again working on radar and other highly classified projects. Paul was preceded in death by his parents, wife Marie and Brother Steve. Paul is survived by his daughter Sue Lage Cost and her husband Frank, son Jeff Lage and his wife Lesly, grandson Alexander Lage Cost, Sister Irene Shepherd, her husband Larry and several nieces and nephews.
