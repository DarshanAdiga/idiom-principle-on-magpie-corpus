First off … what does that mean? "Run at the lives they've always wanted?" Both Grammer and Baldwin are in their sixties and so I'm assuming this will be some show where at least one (more likely both) of them have been divorced by wives who knew they could do better and will waste all their time in this show chasing after improbably hot, younger women because that's always how these things go. Baldwin will play snide and sleazy. And given Grammer's brand and political leanings, odds are also high that he'll be playing a fatuous, conservative blowhard so he doesn't have to act much.

 Value, cyclical and small cap shares outperformed the broader market.
 Moderna Inc said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection based on interim late-state data. It was the second drugmaker in as my weeks, after Pfizer Inc, to announce promising trial data in the development of a vaccine to defeat the pandemic. Its shares gained 9.6% on the day.
 Combined, pending further data and regulatory review, the United States could have as many as 60 million emergency doses available this year.
 “More vaccine news is driving cyclicals, small caps and value, which would be primed if the economy reopens sooner than expected, returning us to some sense of normalcy,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
 Travel-related stocks, which have been clobbered by restrictions to contain the pandemic's spread, were in demand.
 Shares of United Airlines Holdings Inc, American Airlines Group Inc, Carnival Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd jumped between 4.5% and 9.7%.
 But COVID-19 continued its U.S. rampage, with cases surging past 11 million and record infections in 40 states, prompting states to tighten social distancing mandates.
 “Wall Street is looking out six to 12 months down the road,” Pavlik added. “There is a question about ... what kind of damage will be inflicted on the economy between now and then.”
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 470.63 points, or 1.6%, to 29,950.44; the S&P 500 gained 41.76 points, or 1.16%, at 3,626.91; and the Nasdaq Composite added 94.84 points, or 0.8%, at 11,924.13.
 Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but healthcare ended the session in the black, with energy stocks enjoying the largest percentage gain.
 Earnings from high-profile retailers are expected this week, with Walmart Inc and Home Depot Inc expected to report on Tuesday and Lowe's Companies Inc and Target Corp on Wednesday.
 This, together with the Commerce Department's October retail sales data, expected on Tuesday, should provide evidence of how consumers are weathering a languid economic recovery as stimulus runs dry.
 Simon Property Group Inc jumped 5.7% after the biggest U.S. mall operator cut its purchase price for an 80% stake of rival Taubman Centers Inc, as the pandemic pressures the retailers.
 Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.66-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.55-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
 The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and no new lows. The Nasdaq Composite recorded 162 new highs and 15 new lows.

Businesses will now get VAT rebate on raw materials purchased on credit as the National Board of Revenue (NBR) has eased the rules.   NBR's value-added tax (VAT) wing on recently issued a clarification on the matter describing the guidelines for claiming the rebate of paid VAT on raw materials purchased on credit.   Traders will have to complete the payment of dues and procedures for claiming rebate, known as input tax credit, within six tax periods or six months of purchase on credit, according to the guidelines. NBR took the decision considering the ground reality in business practices, officials said.   Manufacturers were also facing difficulties in availing refunds or adjusting their VAT paid on the purchase due to provisions of the VAT and Supplementary Duty Act-2012, they said. Traders had been demanding a solution to legal complexities.   According to the law, traders are not allowed to get refunds on purchase of war materials worth over Tk 1 lakh if the payment is not completed through banking channel. On the other hand, traders are also required to obtain input tax credit (rebate) within four tax periods or four months.   But in practice, manufacturers buy raw materials on credit and the payment is not made instantly through the banking channel.   The revenue board in the new circular said businesses was facing problems in claiming input tax credit because of such provisions of the law. So the clarification has been issued considering the reality to remove the complexities, it said.   As per the prescribed procedures, businesses will have to register such purchases made through VAT invoice (form 6.3) in the purchase account book once the raw materials reach the factory. Businesses will also have to claim rebate on the payment through VAT returns in the same month of purchase, it said.   Traders will have to make increasing adjustment of the input tax or VAT in their VAT returns for the unpaid portion of the value of taxable supply and then the credit portion should be paid through the banking channel within six months of purchase on credit.   After completion of payment, traders will be able to make decreasing adjustment of VAT (claiming rebate) within the same tax periods, the clarification said.   In case of any failure to fulfill the procedures and non-compliance with Article 46 of the VAT law, the NBR will cancel the rebate or decreasing adjustment, it said.

In a year when the COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide shutdowns, and has canceled or postponed nearly everything, Nurnberg said it was clear that there was one thing that could never be shut down.
 "COVID-19 cannot cancel the generosity of Emporia," she said. "We saw that earlier this year with the Greater Emporia Disaster Relief Fund when in six weeks we had raised $200,000. People are generous and they are passionate about their groups and very passionate about their local communities."
 Typically held at the Flinthills Malls, Match Day is an event that helps raise awareness — and much-needed funds — to 23 of the area’s nonprofits. Community members are invited to donate to the organizations of their choice and donations are doubled on the day of the event.
 Participating organizations have been boots on the ground in their communities to raise funds ahead of the event. Nurnberg said it's been exciting to see how successful these groups have been in light of the pandemic.
 "I think with [the pandemic] this year, people in Emporia are still so generous," she said. "People are going out and making their contacts and the results are showing. We'll see for sure on Dec. 1 when we give out the checks, but it's exciting. We're seeing big checks, we're seeing lots of checks, people are active online and people are active in driving up here."

Since Match Day couldn't be held at the mall this year, and wanting to accommodate those who can't or won't donate online, ECF set up a drive-thru donation system at the west entrance of its office. Decorated with balloons, the drive-thru was staffed by volunteers throughout the day.
 Nurnberg said it was a "hard year" for many, and the fact that businesses and individuals were so committed to donating funds or time to the event was proof of the community effort it takes to make Match Day happen each year.
 "It really is a community effort," she said. "I am pleasantly surprised all the way around. People sincerely love the Flint Hills and love their local communities. They want to support them as much as they can."
 Nurnberg said the check presentation ceremony will be held Dec. 1 at the Lyon County History Center. The event will be broadcast live on Facebook and only one representative from each organization will be permitted at the event.
 As for next year, Match Day will happen in 2021. The committee that plans the event doesn't meet until February or March, so what it will look like is still anyone's guess right now.
 "We do have a commitment from our matching sponsors for next year," Nurnberg said. "I really don't know what to tell people except we are going to have Match Day next year."
 Follow @emporiacommunityfoundation on Facebook throughout the day for updates on Match Day. Donations are being accepted online until 11:59 p.m. Nov. 16 and until 5 p.m. at the ECF office, 527 Commercial St., Suite B.

Classes held from Nov. 18-20, and Nov. 23-24 will be eLearning days. Students will still have Thanksgiving break from Nov. 25-29, and return to in-person instruction Nov. 30.
 WSC joins Maconaquah School Corporation and Tipton Community School Corporation in moving to eLearning, with both of those corporations announcing the shift last week.
 According to the letter from WSC, the purpose of the shutdown is to reduce the number of positive cases coming into the schools and then the number who must be quarantined.
 “At the present time, our Principals, Directors, and Transportation Department are juggling staff daily to keep the coverage that is needed, and this problem has continued to grow over that last few weeks,” reads the letter. “Teachers are also working to provide instruction for in-class students, as well as quarantined students."
 "Giving us this extra time away from school will ideally give us a chance to stop the positive cases coming into the school right now and the compounding of quarantines.”
 The corporation notes it is “imperative” students do not gather with others outside their own families, and to social distance, wear masks and frequently wash hands during the next two weeks – even when school is not in session. To report a positive case to the corporation’s hotline, call 765-889-2123.

The Trump administration is expected to cut the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan almost in half to 2,500 by Jan. 15, a U.S. official said Monday.
 The order would stop short of outgoing President Donald Trump’s goal to have all troops withdrawn by the end of the year, which had faced opposition from military and diplomatic advisers.
 The Pentagon also expects to cut the number of troops in Iraq to 2,500, a reduction of more than 500. The decisions follow Mr. Trump’s shakeup of the Pentagon last week in which he installed loyalists who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the Middle East.
 It would give Trump an accomplishment in his final weeks in office even as he refuses to concede his election loss to Joe Biden.
 The official said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders.
 The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. There are between 4,500-5,000 troops in Afghanistan now, and more than 3,000 in Iraq.

 “I want to get my employees to get some money.

The Aggies missed last weekend’s visit to Tennessee.


  “We were wondering if we’d even have football. So we can complain about this and this and that but, listen, we’re still getting to play football,” Fisher said. "The season’s going on. So those are great things for us and the SEC and everybody in college football.”


  The Southeastern Conference, which has had eight games postponed this season, said the Texas A&M-Ole Miss game could be made up Dec. 19, the day of the league championship game and a week after the Aggies play the make-up against the Volunteers.


  The ACC moved up the Wake Forest at Louisville from from Dec. 5 to Nov. 28 and moved Louisville at Boston College back from Nov. 27 to Dec. 12.


  The SEC had four games called off last week, including LSU at No. 1 Alabama. Tigers coach Ed Orgeron said he expected most of the players missing last week to be back at practice by Tuesday as LSU prepares for Saturday's game at Arkansas.


  Among the other games put off this week is Arizona State at Colorado in the Pac-12. Like the Aggies, the Sun Devils will not have a game for a second consecutive week. The Pac-12's abbreviated seven-week schedule, including a championship game on Dec. 18, has no room for make-up dates.


  Last week, 15 FBS games were called off because of COVID-19, the most yet this season as the total since late August is now almost 70. The Mid-American Conference announced its first cancellation, Ohio at Miami (Ohio) scheduled for Tuesday night.
