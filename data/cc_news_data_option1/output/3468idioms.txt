Air China flight CA841 from Beijing lands at Vienna International Airport, Austria, on Aug. 8, 2020. (Xinhua/Guo Chen)


    China's civil aviation regulator has said it will strictly control inbound passenger flights, and passenger loads for inbound flights from regions with a high risk of COVID-19 will not be allowed to exceed 75 percent, following the country's continued experience of receiving imported cases.      The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said the move is due to the fact that the number of imported cases kept rising in August along with an increase in the number of international passenger flights to China.      The CAAC said attention will be paid to carriers that have five passengers with positive nucleic acid test results in three consecutive weeks.      The CAAC said that if the number of passengers whose nucleic acid test results are positive after entry is zero for three consecutive weeks, the 75 percent passenger load factor limit can be cancelled.      The CAAC, along with government departments including the National Health Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, unveiled in early June incentives and penalties known as "circuit breakers" for carriers based on the results of passengers' nucleic acid tests.      If more than five passengers on board test positive for COVID-19, a carrier will be suspended for one week. The suspension is for four weeks if 10 passengers test positive.      Airlines on the same route can fly a maximum of two flights per week if they report zero positive test results for inbound passengers for three consecutive weeks.      On August 11, the Civil Aviation Administration of China triggered three "circuit breakers" in one day as passengers returned positive COVID-19 test results on Etihad Airways EY862, China Eastern MU212 and Sri Lankan Airlines UL866. The flights will be suspended for 1 week.      Up to now, the CAAC has cancelled 52 inbound flights, triggered by the circuit breakers.      Airlines now require more overseas travelers to take nucleic acid test results for COVID-19 within 72 hours of boarding.      The Chinese Embassy in Brazil announced recently that travelers flying to China from Brazil — including those transiting via Brazil — must provide nucleic acid test results for COVID-19 taken within 72 hours of boarding, starting from September 7. The announcement comes as the country reports a rising number of confirmed cases and possible cases of re-infection.      Global Times

The unexpected downtime was weird. He'd find himself keeping up with the group by checking out Instagram. The team even dropped off workout equipment for him to do by himself, and the early stages of his return included arriving at the ballpark well before everyone else, then stepping aside when things got serious.


  Yet his body recovered and he kept to a routine in hopes of staying sharp. It wasn't much different than most minor league seasons, save for the lack of a nine-inning game at the end. Hayes kept track as the Pirates quickly plummeted to the bottom of the National League Central but tried to not get ahead of himself.


  When Brian Esposito, who managed Hayes last season at Triple-A, called Hayes and told him he would be working out at PNC Park on Monday against rehabbing Pirates starter Mitch Keller “and then staying,” Hayes thought he was getting punked. For once, though, Esposito was serious.


  So was Hayes' reaction.


  “I got chills in my body," Hayes said. “I mean, it’s what I worked for my whole life and you can ask anyone back home, I put 100 percent effort into getting where I am today.”


  The Pirates plan to play Hayes regularly, provided his body gets up to speed with the sprint that is the truncated 2020 season. Considering the roster is filled with good friends like Bryan Reynolds and Kevin Newman who mirrored Hayes' rise through the system, he expects it to feel oddly normal.


  “I grew up playing with all of those guys,” Hayes said. "We’re like brothers when we’re at the field. I think it’s very important.”

BROCKTON -- A Whitman mother charged with manslaughter in her 2-year-old daughter's death is back in custody after her bail was revoked for violating the conditions of her release, prosecutors said.


  The Plymouth County district attorney's office said it sought and obtained a probation warrant on Monday charging Shaniqua Leonard, 29, with violating an expressed condition of her release, "namely that she abide by the laws of the commonwealth."

  Prosecutors say Leonard threatened to "slaughter" her neighbors in Whitman on Aug. 29 in an "unprovoked confrontation" that was captured via audio and video by a home security system.


  State police attempted to arrest Leonard in Roxbury on Monday where her GPS- monitoring bracelet indicated she was, but prosecutors say she had cut it off before police arrived. The district attorney's office said state police, Whitman police and Boston police "expended considerable time and resources" trying to locate Leonard, but were unsuccessful.


  Leonard turned herself in to the probation department at Brockton Superior Court on Tuesday, prosecutors said.


  At a hearing Tuesday afternoon, prosecutors moved to revoke Leonard's $25,000 cash bail for an alleged violation of the conditions of her release.


  Judge Maynard Kirpalani allowed the motion, revoking Leonard's bail and took the matter under further advisement. Leonard was taken into custody and will be held without bail for up to 90 days.


  Leonard was held on $25,000 bail following her superior court arraignment on Aug. 18. She was arraigned that day on a felony charge of manslaughter in connection with the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Lyric Farrell, who was found unresponsive in her family's Whitman home on Dec. 28, 2019.


  Lyric was declared brain-dead two days later and, at 3 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 31, she was taken off of life support.


  Leonard had previously been charged with reckless endangerment of a child, until she was recently indicted by a grand jury.


  Prosecutors say Leonard delayed getting her daughter any help in the hours leading up to her death. An autopsy determined Lyric died as a result of complications from blunt force trauma head injuries that could only be inflicted with a force equivalent to a violent car crash, prosecutors said.


  At her superior court arraignment, prosecutors requested Leonard be held on $100,000 bail, but Kirpalani set bail at $25,000, with conditions she wear a GPS bracelet, have no contact with her other children, abstain from drug and alcohol use, undergo mental health screenings and not carry a firearm.


  On Tuesday, Leonard's attorney said her $25,000 bail was posted by The National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls.


  The National Council, which runs a "#FreeHer Campaign," says it is committed to abolishing incarceration for women and girls.


  "It is becoming crystal clear that these bail funds serve no purpose other than to free criminals to commit more crimes, with no regard for public safety, and absolutely no compassion for the victims," Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy Cruz said in a statement.


  The National Council didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.


  Leonard is due back in Brockton Superior Court on Sept. 22. She will also be summoned to Brockton District Court at a later date on new charges related to the recent threats.

WASHINGTON -- Tens of thousands of loans worth billions of dollars may have been subject to fraud, waste and abuse in the $659 billion taxpayer-funded Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) aimed at helping small U.S. businesses survive the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released by Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday.


  Over $1 billion went to companies that received multiple loans, in violation of the program's rules, the House of Representatives Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis said.


  At an afternoon hearing, the panel's chairman, Democratic Representative James Clyburn, chided Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for saying previously that delivering aid quickly made it inevitable for Treasury to run into issues of waste.


  "That is a false dichotomy. Taxpayers should not have to choose between quickly getting aid to those who need it and wasting federal funds. And there are simple steps that could have been taken to improve oversight and reduce fraud," Clyburn said.


  Democrats in Congress and the Trump administration have been at loggerheads since July over further steps to bolster the economy after Congress approved trillions of dollars in March to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.


  "We are sensitive to the fact that there is more work to be done and certain areas of the economy require additional relief," Mnuchin told the committee.


  The PPP provided more than 5.2 million forgivable loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) by the time it ended on Aug. 8.


  The SBA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


  The Trump administration says the PPP has saved some 51 million jobs at a time when much of the U.S. economy has been shuttered due to the coronavirus.


  Economists say the actual impact is far lower, likely between 1 million and 14 million jobs.


  Republicans on the committee issued their own report saying the small business loan program had avoided fraud to the extent that is typical with other large government relief programs, such as those following Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.


  The Democratic-led panel found more than 600 loans went to companies that should have been ineligible because they had been barred from doing business with the government. Another 350 loans went to contractors with previous performance problems.


  Nearly $3 billion went to businesses that were flagged as potentially problematic by a government-contracting database.


  Staff found evidence that as few as 12 percent of Black and Hispanic business owners received the full funding they requested.


  The SBA's internal watchdog has also found "strong indicators" of potential PPP fraud. (Reporting by Susan Cornwell and David Morgan; Editing by Andy Sullivan, Chizu Nomiyama, Steve Orlofsky and Richard Chang)

WASHINGTON — John Thompson, the imposing Hall of Famer who turned Georgetown into a “Hoya Paranoia” powerhouse and became the first Black coach to lead a team to the NCAA men’s basketball championship, has died. He was 78.


  His death was announced in a family statement released by Georgetown on Monday. No details were disclosed.


  “Our father was an inspiration to many and devoted his life to developing young people not simply on but, most importantly, off the basketball court. He is revered as a historic shepherd of the sport, dedicated to the welfare of his community above all else,” the statement said. “However, for us, his greatest legacy remains as a father, grandfather, uncle, and friend. More than a coach, he was our foundation. More than a legend, he was the voice in our ear everyday.”


  One of the most celebrated and polarizing figures in his sport, Thompson took over a moribund Georgetown program in the 1970s and molded it in his unique style into a perennial contender, culminating with a national championship team anchored by center Patrick Ewing in 1984.


  Georgetown reached two other title games with Thompson in charge and Ewing patrolling the paint, losing to Michael Jordan’s North Carolina team in 1982 and to Villanova in 1985.


  At 6-foot-10, with an ever-present white towel slung over his shoulder, Thompson literally and figuratively towered over the Hoyas for decades, becoming a patriarch of sorts after he quit coaching in 1999.


  One of his sons, John Thompson III, was hired as Georgetown’s coach in 2004. When the son was fired in 2017, the elder Thompson — known affectionately as “Big John” or “Pops” to many — was at the news conference announcing Ewing as the successor.


  Along the way, Thompson said what he thought, shielded his players from the media and took positions that weren’t always popular. He never shied away from sensitive topics — particularly the role of race in both sports and society — and he once famously walked off the court before a game to protest an NCAA rule because he felt it hurt minority athletes.


  “I’ll probably be remembered for all the things that kept me out of the Hall of Fame, ironically, more than for the things that got me into it,” Thompson said on the day he was elected to the Hall in 1999.


  Thompson became coach of the Hoyas in 1972 and began remaking a team that was 3-23 the previous season. Over the next 27 years, he led Georgetown to 14 straight NCAA tournaments (1979-92), 24 consecutive postseason appearances (20 NCAA, 4 NIT), three Final Fours (1982, 1984, 1985) and won six Big East tournament championships.


  “He was one of a kind,” Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, a fierce rival for many years in the Big East Conference, said Monday. “There aren’t that many. He brought a presence to the game that nobody does, has. He was a great coach, but he was also a role model for a lot of coaches — white coaches and Black coaches.”


  Employing a physical, defense-focused approach that frequently relied on a dominant center — Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo were among his other pupils — Thompson compiled a 596-239 record (.715 winning percentage). He had 26 players drafted by the NBA.


  One of his honors — his selection as coach of the U.S. team for the 1988 Olympics — had a sour ending when the Americans had to settle for the bronze medal. It was a result so disappointing that Thompson put himself on a sort of self-imposed leave at Georgetown for a while, coaching practices and games but leaving many other duties to his assistants.


  Off the court, Thompson was both a role model and a lightning rod. A stickler for academics, he kept a deflated basketball on his desk, a reminder to his players that a degree was a necessity because a career in basketball relied on a tenuous “nine pounds of air.”


  The school boasted that 76 of 78 players who played four seasons under Thompson received their degrees.


  He was a Black coach who recruited mostly Black players to a predominantly white Jesuit university in Washington, and Thompson never hesitated to speak out on behalf of his players.


  One of the most dramatic moments in Georgetown history came on Jan. 14, 1989, when he walked off the court to a standing ovation before the tipoff of a home game against Boston College, demonstrating in a most public way his displeasure against NCAA Proposition 42.


  The rule denied athletic scholarships to freshmen who didn’t meet certain requirements, and Thompson said it was biased against underprivileged students. Opposition from Thompson, and others, led the NCAA to modify the rule.


  Thompson’s most daring move came that same year, when he summoned notorious drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III for a meeting in the coach’s office. Thompson warned Edmond to stop associating with Hoyas players and to leave them alone, using his respect in the Black community to become one of the few people to stare down Edmond and not face a reprisal.


  Though aware of his influence, Thompson did not take pride in becoming the first Black coach to take a team to the Final Four, and he let a room full of reporters know it when asked his feelings on the subject at a news conference in 1982.


  “I resent the hell out of that question if it implies I am the first Black coach competent enough to take a team to the Final Four,” Thompson said. “Other Blacks have been denied the right in this country; coaches who have the ability. I don’t take any pride in being the first Black coach in the Final Four. I find the question extremely offensive.”


  Born Sept. 2, 1941, John R. Thompson Jr. grew up in Washington, D.C. His father was always working — on a farm in Maryland and later as a laborer in the city — and could neither read nor write.


  “I never in my life saw my father’s hands clean,” Thompson said in 2007. “Never. He’d come home and scrub his hands with this ugly brown soap that looked like tar. I thought that was the color of his hands. When I was still coaching, kids would show up late for practice and I’d (say) ... ‘My father got up every morning of his life at 5 a.m. to go to work. Without an alarm.’ ”


  Thompson’s parents emphasized education, but he struggled in part of because of poor eyesight and labored in Catholic grammar school. He was moved to a segregated public school, had a growth spurt and became good enough at basketball to get into John Carroll, a Catholic high school, where he led the team to 55 consecutive victories and two city titles.


  He went to Providence College as one of the most touted basketball prospects in the country and led the Friars to the first NCAA bid in school history. He graduated in 1964 and played two seasons with Red Auerbach’s Boston Celtics, earning a pair of championship rings as a sparingly used backup to Bill Russell.


  Thompson returned to Washington, got his master’s degree in guidance and counseling from the University of the District of Columbia and went 122-28 over six seasons at St. Anthony’s before accepting the job at Georgetown, an elite school that had relatively few Black students. Faculty and students rallied around him after a bedsheet with racist words was hung inside the school’s gym before a game during the 1974-75 season.


  Thompson sheltered his players with closed practices, tightly controlled media access and a prohibition on interviews with freshmen in their first semester — a restriction that still stands for Georgetown’s basketball team. Combined with Thompson’s flashes of emotion and his players’ rough-and-tumble style of play, it wasn’t long before the words “Hoya Paranoia” came to epitomize the new era of basketball on the Hilltop campus.


  Georgetown lost the 1982 NCAA championship game when Fred Brown mistakenly passed the ball to North Carolina’s James Worthy in the game’s final seconds. Two years later, Ewing led an 84-75 win over Houston in the title game. The Hoyas were on the verge of a repeat the following year when they were stunned in the championship game by coach Rollie Massimino’s Villanova team in one of the biggest upsets in tournament history.


  Success allowed Thompson to rake in money through endorsements, but he ran afoul of his Georgetown bosses when he applied for a gambling license for a business venture in Nevada in 1995. Thompson, who liked playing the slot machines in Las Vegas, reluctantly dropped the application after the university president objected.


  Centers Ewing, Mourning and Mutombo turned Georgetown into “Big Man U” under Thompson, although his last superstar was guard Allen Iverson, who in 1996 also became the first player under Thompson to leave school early for the NBA draft.


  “Thanks for Saving My Life Coach,” Iverson wrote at the start of an Instagram post Monday with photos of the pair.


  The Hoyas teams in the 1990s never came close to matching the achievements of the 1980s, and Thompson’s era came to a surprising and sudden end when he resigned in the middle of the 1998-99 season, citing distractions from a pending divorce.


  Thompson didn’t fade from the limelight. He became a sports radio talk show host and a TV and radio game analyst, joining the very profession he had frustrated so often as a coach. He loosened up, allowing the public to see his lighter side, but he remained pointed and combative when a topic mattered to him.


  A torch was passed in 2004, when John Thompson III became Georgetown’s coach. The younger Thompson, with “Pops” often watching from the stands or sitting in the back of the room for news conferences, returned the Hoyas to the Final Four in 2007.


  Another son, Ronny Thompson, was head coach for one season at Ball State and is now a TV analyst.

TOKYO — Finding the pandemic scary? A Japanese group is trying to take people’s minds off COVID-19 — by putting them in coffins surrounded by chainsaw-wielding zombies.


  Customers this weekend in Tokyo can lie in a 6 ½-foot windowed box, listening to a horror story, watching actors perform and getting poked with fake hands and squirted with water.


  “The pandemic is stressful, and we hope people can get a bit of relief by having a good scream,” said Kenta Iwana, coordinator of production company Kowagarasetai — “Scare Squad” — which is putting on the 15-minute shows.


  As Japan experiences a COVID-19 upswing — with 1,034 infections of the new coronavirus on Friday — Iwana, 25, is scrambling to find work for his actors, who normally perform at venues such as theme parks.


  Last month Kowagarasetai offered drive-in horror shows.


  Customers, too, are looking for alternatives — and a way to blow off steam.


  “Lots of events have been canceled because of the coronavirus, and I was looking for a way to get rid of my stress,” said Kazushiro Hashiguchi, 36, said after lying through the $7.60 show.


  “I feel relaxed now.”


  Customers for the shows, held in a rest lounge usually used by passengers arriving in the capital on overnight bus trips, include shopping mall owners and operators of other venues who Iwana hopes will host his mobile shows.


  “We needed to have something that we could take anywhere, and coffins are easy to move. All you need to do is put them in a dark room,” said Iwana. “It’s good business for us and satisfying for our customers.”

Army coach Jeff Monken is stoked for the football season, no matter what the schedule looks like.


  “If I was any better I’d have a twin,” Monken joked. “I'm excited to be out here with my team. Our players are excited. They're looking forward to the football season.”


  The glee is understandable for the seventh-year coach. Football is a big deal at the academy, and almost all of Army's original schedule was wiped out by the pandemic. Dogged work by senior associate athletic director Bob Beretta lined up new opponents to save the season.


  “We were prepared for the challenges that arose, remained in front of the events as they unfolded and were relentless in accomplishing the mission of delivering a full 12-game schedule," Beretta said. "We were forced to rebuild the schedule several times but are extremely pleased with the end product.”


  Army finished 5-8 last season after winning a school-record 11 games — and the coveted Commander-in-Chief's Trophy as top dog among the three service academies — the previous year. Injuries at quarterback quickly put a damper on the season when standout senior Kelvin Hopkins Jr. and backup Jabari Laws were hurt early.


  Hopkins never regained the form he displayed in 2018 in becoming the first player in West Point history to eclipse 1,000 yards both rushing and passing in a season.

The Super Bowl LIII ring that the New England Patriots gifted to wide receiver Josh Gordon was auctioned off for $138,000, according to Sports Collectors Daily.


  Gordon played in 11 games for the Patriots that season but was suspended by the NFL in December 2018. The ban shelved the troubled wide receiver for the playoffs, including the Patriots’ 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII.


  Gordon finished the 2018 regular season with 40 catches for 720 yards and three touchdowns for the Patriots, including Tom Brady’s 500th career TD pass on Oct. 4. The team rewarded Gordon with a ring, which has now been sold through Heritage Auctions.


  Gordon started the 2018 season in Cleveland, catching a 17-yard touchdown pass before being dealt to New England after one game. The Browns selected Gordon in the second round of the 2012 NFL Supplemental Draft.


  Heritage promoted Gordon’s ring as “the sixth and final Patriots ring of the Brady era.”


  Also during the auction, a Michael Jordan rookie card sold for $420,000 and a Mickey Mantle 1958 World Series bat brought $288,000.


  Gordon, in the midst of his sixth NFL suspension for a drug violation, hopes to return to action this year.


  Gordon, 29, received his latest punishment, an indefinite ban, in mid- December for violating league policies prohibiting performance-enhancing drugs and “substances of abuse.”


  Gordon was reinstated in August 2019 and started that season with the Patriots. After making 20 receptions for 287 yards and a touchdown in six games for New England, he was waived. He was then claimed by the Seattle Seahawks, and he caught seven passes for 139 yards in five games before his season was cut short by the latest suspension.


  Should he be reinstated by the league, he would be an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career.

Is it safe to go to the grocery store? Can my kids have a play date? Will the other child wear a mask? Can I send them back to school? When my boss asks me to come back to the office, should I?


  Shayla Bell lies awake at night racking her brain for answers and preparing for another day of unprecedented choices.


  "There's all these little, small decisions all the time," said Bell, a suburban Chicago retail professional with two kids. "I find myself being my own devil's advocate so often to try to reach the best conclusion. And I'm tired."


  Six months since the United States declared the coronavirus pandemic a state of emergency, millions of isolated Americans are at their wits' end, exhausted from making a seemingly endless series of health and safety decisions for themselves and their loved ones. There's a name for this phenomenon, and researchers call it decision fatigue.


  "It's a state of low willpower that results from having invested effort into making choices," said Roy Baumeister, a psychology professor at Florida State University who coined the term in 2010. "It leads to putting less effort into making further choices, so either choices are avoided or they are made in a very superficial way."


  Like a mental gas tank, the human brain has a limited capacity of energy, and as you make decisions throughout the day, you deplete that resource. As you become fatigued, you may be inclined to avoid additional decisions, stick to the status quo or base a decision on a single criteria, Baumeister said.


  When we're able to maintain daily routines, the brain can automate decisions and rely on heuristics - or mental shortcuts - to avoid fatigue. But the pandemic has disrupted many of our routines, forcing us to allocate more mental energy to decision-making.


  The effects of decision fatigue have serious implications for people in positions of authority. Jonathan Levav, who studies behavioral decision theory at Stanford University, found that judges serving on parole boards in Israel were more likely to give favorable rulings at the very beginning of the workday or after a food break than later in a sequence of cases, after the judges had made more decisions.


  "If you make a lot of decisions repeatedly, that has an effect on subsequent decisions," Levav said. "As people make more decisions, they're more likely to simplify whatever subsequent decisions they're dealing with."


  Similar studies have found that people making decisions on behalf of loved ones in intensive care units or nurses working telemedicine shifts, experience decision fatigue over time, which can impair their ability to make informed decisions for the patient or provide efficient recommendations, respectively.


  We're not just making a greater number of daily decisions. We're also making high-stakes, moral decisions, said Elizabeth Yuko, a writer and staff member at the Fordham University Center for Ethics Education.


  "It's fatigue with making decisions that have consequences we've never had to deal with before," Yuko said. "These things come with such a moral weight on them, it comes with even more stress."


  For parents and guardians, in particular, the stakes are high. Erin Scarpa, a mother of two who works at a bank in New Jersey, said she temporarily relocated her family to North Carolina specifically to avoid making decisions about socializing with neighbors. Scarpa said she's particularly concerned about reports of patients suffering lasting damage from COVID-19.


  "You're talking about decisions that could limit your child's life forever," Scarpa said. "That's a whole other concept."


  Sneha Dave, a recent college graduate living with an inflammatory bowel disease and unidentified respiratory condition, said she struggled with crippling decision fatigue at the beginning of the pandemic.


  "There's been so many times where I go to the grocery store where I turn around because there are too many cars there. I spend a lot of time deciding what the right time to go to the grocery store is or whether I should go in," she said.


  Dave said she's still grappling with a big decision - whether or not to pursue a round of treatment for her bowel disease, which would severely weaken her immune system - but she's slowly learned how to cope with her decision fatigue.


  "The chronic illness community has been able to adapt significantly better and make these decisions a little easier because these are decisions we've made our whole lives," Dave said.


  How statewide COVID-19 policies affect decision fatigue


  Streamlined state and nationwide policies on COVID-19 have the potential to alleviate decision fatigue, some researchers said, but the notion of greater regulation carries contentious political implications.


  "The more that requirements are in place, such as mask mandates, the less it's a personal choice about what to do. And it makes it easier to make other, related decisions," said Kathleen Vohs, a professor at the University of Minnesota who studies self-control. "You don't have to agonize about whether it's safe to go to the grocery store when you know that others will have masks on."


  Mandates may also cause people to feel depleted if they find it difficult to comply with a policy, researchers said. Others may be making such specific, preferential decisions that statewide policies wouldn't be enough to alleviate decision fatigue.


  Sheena Iyengar, a Columbia Business School professor and author studying the psychology and economics of choice, is gathering data on how Americans feel about statewide COVID-19 policies.


  Contrary to classical economic theory, Iyengar's work has found that, in some contexts, people may prefer to have their choices limited or entirely removed. For example, people are more likely to purchase jams or chocolates - or to undertake optional class essay assignments - when offered a limited rather than extensive array of choices. Study participants reported greater satisfaction with their selections when their options had been limited.


  A similar trend may be playing out when it comes to COVID-19 policies, Iyengar said. Her preliminary findings suggest that people living in states with face mask policies reported being "happier" than those in states without mask mandates. The findings may simply be driven by political preferences, Iyengar said.


  "There's a naturally occurring experiment, although that experiment falls along political lines," she said.


  Tips for avoiding decision fatigue


  There are some simple strategies for avoiding decision fatigue, researchers said. Many center on general health and well-being, such as maintaining a nutritious diet, getting a full night's sleep and exercising regularly. Others focus on timing your decisions and developing routines to cut out unnecessary choices.


  "Willpower diminishes and decision fatigue increases over the course of the day, so if you have important decisions to make, make them in the morning after a full night's sleep and a good breakfast," Baumeister said. "Be aware this is affecting you."


  Plan out tomorrow's schedule the day before, said Dovid Spinka, a staff clinician at the Center for Anxiety in New York City. Prep or plan your meals for the week. Lay out your clothes in the evening, or - like Steve Jobs - develop a uniform.


  If you begin to fade during the day, take a short break, go for a walk or practice mindfulness or breathing exercises, Spinka said. Prioritize your decisions, and try to focus on one at a time. If you're facing a big decision but feel drained, take a nap or grab a snack. Write down your initial thoughts, but don't make the decision yet. Come back to it when you're feeling refreshed, or proactively delay the decision to a set date.


  Especially in highly emotional times, people who tend to suppress their emotions may be more prone to experience decision fatigue, said Grant Pignatiello, a researcher at Case Western Reserve University. It's important to be aware of how you're feeling and talk to others about it.


  "We are all going through a collective trauma of this pandemic, so it's important that we cut ourselves a little slack. If we need to take a nap at the end of the day, watch Netflix or go for a walk, it's OK," Pignatiello said.


  For Bell, that means granting herself some grace.


  "I feel like we're all - even the coolest cucumbers - we're all at a higher stress level now," she said. "So try to have some grace for yourself and others, and understand that we're all doing the best we think we can."

OKAUCHEE — Boats on Okauchee Lake aren’t exactly an uncommon sight, but on Saturday those that took to the water did so in political solidarity and in support of President Donald Trump’s re-election.
 Republicans and Trump supporters from throughout the region gathered at the Golden Mast Inn Saturday afternoon before boarding their respective boats and participating in an aquatic parade for the incumbent president. Most attendees came dressed in the colors of the American flag, and some of the boats were decorated for the occasion, with “Make America Great Again” flags a common sight as well as more remarkable ones such as a sternmounted cardboard cutout of the president giving two thumbs up and a billboard of the Republican elephant sporting Trump’s characteristic haircut.
 Trump merchandise was for sale in town nearby as well as signable petitions for the effort to recall Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat. Some people did not get on boats but instead watched the parade from the shore.
 “What a great way to support President Trump and carry him on to victory,” said Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, who is on the ballot to succeed longtime Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner in November. “I know the Trump team has been working hard to pull this together.”
 Fitzgerald said the Senate would “gavel in” during the special session called by Evers Monday on police reform, but would have to “work through” the pieces of legislation on the table. “Hopefully we’ll pull something together,” he said.
 Fitzgerald was accompanied by former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on one of the parade boats as well as Assembly Rep. Barb Dittrich, ROconomowoc.
 State Sens. Chris Kapenga and Steve Nass also attended the event.
 Candee Arndt, Wisconsin state director for the Trump Victory Finance Committee, said she had the idea for the event after being in Florida and realizing the Trump boat parades there could be held in Wisconsin too. Golden Mast Inn owners Marijo and Hans Weissgerber organized the event with Arndt. A parallel private event was held inside the Golden Mast, which had limited attendance due to COVID-19 precautions.
 “Nobody is more energetic than Okauchee Lake and the people of Okauchee Lake,” Hans Weissgerber said.
 Arndt was pleased with the “fabulous” turnout of what she estimated to be around 200 boats on the lake. She passed out “Keep America Great” hats to some attendees and said there will be another boat parade in Green Bay Sep. 12.
 One of the attendees to receive a hat was Joe Mei, of the Oconomowoc area, who said he was
 motivated to come out to support Donald Trump and patriotism.
 “This is a peaceful parade,” he said. “We love our country, we love our president.”
 After the parade, Fitzgerald and Walker spoke from the gazebo at the Golden Mast, with the smaller private crowd on the raised patio with them and a much larger crowd listening below.
 “We can do this; It can happen,” Fitzgerald said. “Things are breaking our way right now, and that’s going to continue to happen for the next 60 days.”
 Walker criticized former Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s decision not to attend the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in person over coronavirus precautions. “We need a 2012 turnout, not a 2018 turnout,” Walker said. “We knew what was at stake in that recall election... “If we carry this state with a convincing win for the president and vice president, we can elect enough Republicans to have a veto-proof majority in the state Assembly and the state Senate.”
 Waukesha County Republican Party Chairman Terry Dittrich thanked the “Trump armada” for making the parade happen, and said Waukesha County will be “ground zero” for the upcoming election. He encouraged everyone to get involved.
 Getting involved, and a sense of urgency, seems to be things both parties agree on currently.
 “Don’t think about 64 days until Election Day,” said Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler, on Twitter. “Think about 17 days until absentee ballots drop in Wisconsin.”

"It's funny you mention that," Dominik said, speaking of the pressure. "I flew into Orlando on Saturday mid-day and was able to catch _NXT_ _TakeOver_ XXX, and was able to catch Pat's match.

The pressure from having to wrestle Seth at _SummerSlam_ and having to put on a _SummerSlam_ caliber match. The fact that I have the Mysterio name on my back and trying to make my dad proud, but I was focused on the task at hand and knew what had to be done.


  "The reaction backstage was crazy," Dominik continued. "I got very emotional. I hugged my mom, hugged my dad, hugged Jamie and Seth. Everyone was very happy and clapping for me.

His father, Rey Mysterio Jr., was working in WWE without a contract for quite some time.

Path Of Exile is a game constantly reinventing itself. Seven years in, Grinding Gear Games still regularly reimagines major features with quarterly expansions. The Heist update, launching on September 18th, might just be their biggest since 2017’s enormous _Fall Of Oriath_. Operating out of a whole new town, players will plot high-risk, high-reward heists alongside a cast of all new recruitable NPC criminals. And they say crime doesn’t pay.
 Heist is practically a whole new game operating in parallel with Path Of Exile’s regular story campaign. Early on, players will unlock access to the Rogue Harbour, a hive of scum and villainy that they can truly call their own. Over the course of the normal game, players will collect two new types of items, Contracts and Markers. Contracts are the papers you need to begin plotting a heist. Markers are a form of criminal currency that you’ll use to pay your co-conspirators. You can’t just run into a vault, kick down the door and grab the treasure here. You’ll need to hire _professionals_.
 There’s going to be a fully voiced cast of 13 new characters in this update. Four of them run the Harbour, but the other nine you can recruit, level up, equip and bring with you on heist missions. The treasure vaults are located behind complex security systems, and you’ll need experts in lockpicking, engineering, demolitions and more to bypass these defenses. Plus, it seems like a fun excuse to hang out with a bunch of new, fully voiced characters in a game otherwise focused on wading hip-deep through thousands of monsters.
 Heists will play quite differently from normal Path of Exile runs. For once you’re not trying to scour the place clean. Every fight you get into, every treasure chest cracked open and every noise made increases the security level of the building. If you max out the security gauge, a countdown begins until they permanently seal the treasure vault and flood the area with guards, so your goal is to get to the target relatively quietly. You grab the goods (and anything else you can carry) and then try to escape. Outside of Hardcore mode, Path Of Exile is usually quite forgiving of death, but not so much here. You only get to keep your stolen goods if you can safely extract them from the building, and you only have so much space in your inventory, so you'll have to carefully pick what you pilfer.
 While Path Of Exile always had summonable minions, Heist is the first time that players have been able to hire and work alongside customizable NPCs, and should be an interesting test-bed for how Diablo-style Hireling AI might work in future updates, and perhaps in Path Of Exile 2. While some might fear the addition of AI party members might turn into a frustrating escort mission, Grinding Gear explained that during heist missions, your hired help cannot be killed. Their work _can_ be interrupted, however, so it’s up to you to provide cover if they’re trying to pick a lock or blow a safe door off its hinges. At least for the time being, I like to think of them as mobile objective points that you can (as with everything else in the game) customize over time.

Monday night, the county implemented a new policy that restaurant patrons sitting indoors must wear masks at all times, except when eating or drinking. Outdoor patrons may still remove masks while not consuming food or beverages.      Gyms, dance studios, yoga studios and fitness centers may operate with 10% occupancy. Hair salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors, piercing shops, skin care and cosmetology services and nail salons may operate indoors with normal capacity, but a new policy states they must keep an appointment book with names and contact information for customers to track potential future outbreaks.      San Diego County's state-calculated daily case rate per 100,000 people is 5.8 and the testing positivity percentage -- which runs on a time lag -- is 3.8%. These numbers are elevated enough to keep the county in the "red" or second tier of the state's reopening plan.      County Supervisor Greg Cox thanked San Diegans for working hard to bring the case rate down but offered a word of caution on Monday.      "This is not a green light, this is a yellow light," he said. "We can't gun the engine of the economy full throttle yet."      Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer, said the county would follow state guidelines that retail businesses are to be restricted to 50% occupancy. Wooten said she was seeking clarification on grocery stores for the same restriction.      All indoor businesses must still abide by social distancing and face- covering mandates, as well as having a detailed safe reopening plan on file with the county.      On Monday, San Diego State University reported another 13 students, some of whom live in campus housing, have tested positive for COVID-19. They join seven other students who tested positive for the illness last week. None of the students have attended any in-person classes.      An SDSU statement said the university had taken direct action with the students who live in university-owned housing.      "Three of the cases live on-campus at Zapotec, Villa Alvarado Apartments and South Campus Plaza North," the statement said. "Two on-campus students have been moved to a designated isolation room, per SDSU's Office of Housing Administration COVID-19 protocol. The other student was already isolating away from campus, prior to seeking testing this weekend. All are recovering well."      A total of 31 SDSU students have contracted COVID-19 since March.

Roger P. Wallins, of Moscow, died Friday, Aug. 28, 2020, at Kootenai Health in Coeur d’Alene. He was 78.


  Roger Peyton Wallins was born in New York City on Oct. 24, 1941, to parents Albert and Beatrice. He and his sister, Barbara, grew up in uptown Manhattan.


  His family infused him with the love of education. He was allowed to complete three junior high grades in two years, and earned his diploma at the Bronx High School of Science. He was 16 when he enrolled at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to major in chemical engineering. He enjoyed mixing explosive chemicals together, but that wasn’t enough to make him an engineer. In the middle of his sophomore year, he enrolled at City College of New York, where he realized that he loved the study of English literature.


  He completed his bachelor’s and became a teaching assistant at Ohio State at 20 years old while earning his master’s and Ph.D. degrees. In 1966, Roger gave a presentation at the Ohio State student union and a smart, beautiful young woman named Judy heard the presentation and decided that she wanted to get to know Roger better. That was the most fortunate event in Roger’s young life. Roger Wallins and Judy Beach dated, got engaged, and on March 19, 1967, were married and lived happily ever after. Two of their happiest events were the births of daughters Rachel in January 1969 and Beatrice in February 1973.


  A tenure-track offer from the University of Idaho in December 1970 led the family to Moscow, where Roger began as an assistant professor of English, specializing in Victorian literature and director of composition. He was promoted through the ranks from assistant professor to full professor of English, and was selected by his students to receive an outstanding teacher award.


  He moved into administration and ended his career as associate dean of the College of Graduate Studies and director of University Graduate Admissions. During his time, Roger established the Graduate Student Assistance Program, the goal of which is to help students afford their graduate educations.


  Roger valued and loved volunteer work. He served as president of the Latah Credit Union, the Moscow Community Theatre and the Idaho Repertory Theatre Advisory Board, and as chairman of the Moscow School Board and the Moscow Fair Housing Commission. He also served three terms on the Board of Directors of the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Palouse and the Moscow Arts Commission. In retirement, he served as a general member for Gritman Medical Center and on their Quality Improvement Committee. He also invested in the stock market and took his entire family on a Disney cruise with his ill-gotten gains.


  He acted in more than 25 productions for Moscow Community Theatre, worked behind the scenes on nearly that many plays, and directed youth casts and technical crews in multiple productions. He also taught a Youth Acting Workshop for 9-to-17-year-olds. For his contributions to the arts, in 2012 Roger received the Kenworthy Players’ Performing Arts Award and the Mayor’s Lifetime Achievement in the Arts Award.


  Roger was a family man. It was important to Judy and him that they have dinner each evening with their school-aged daughters, and that they attend all of their kids’ activities.


  During his lifetime, his favorite dogs were Turbi, Sally, Maggie and Tori; his favorite parakeets, Joey, Pip and Woolf.


  He is survived by wife Judith; daughter Rachel and son-in-law Jeff Guberman; daughter Beatrice and former son-in-law David Lawrence; granddaughters Elana, Charlotte and Abigail, and grandson Nicky. His sister, Barbara, also survives him, along with multiple beloved extended family members. He dearly and completely loved his family.


  The family held a private graveside service but a larger (Kibbie Dome large) memorial will be held in the spring. Get your stories ready now.


  Memorial gifts may be made to the Graduate Student Assistance Program (GSAP) at the University of Idaho, the Moscow Community Theatre and the Humane Society of the Palouse.


  Arrangements were entrusted to Short's Funeral Chapel, Moscow, and online condolences may be sent to www.shortsfuneralchapel.com.

It was featured in 2014 on the cover of Architectural Digest, and the home doesn’t appear to have changed since then, with the owners’ art still hanging on the walls, and the funky decor still filling the rooms.


  “We’re here for the weather, the Latin flavor, the art, and the palm trees. Most of all, we’re here for the fun,” Hilfiger told the magazine at the time.


  Fun is definitely the theme of this one-of-a-kind, designer-decorated beach house.


  It’s set on over a half-acre, with 100 feet of secluded beach frontage, and the listing notes that this oceanfront showcase offers 14,075 square feet designed for “leisurely, luxurious living.”


  With seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and four half-bathrooms, the layout also includes a black marble staircase and is highlighted by a double-height gallery to display works of art.


  Wallpaper patterns, artwork, and flooring combine for a unique look to each room. The living room features walls of windows and a bar. The master suite features a mirrored bed frame and a wall of windows.


  The adjacent gourmet kitchen features black-and-white geometric flooring, as well as Miele, Gaggenau, and Sub-Zero appliances. The formal dining room also features a black-and white theme. The media room is covered with bold, patterned wallpaper.


  Hilfiger’s office is decked out in his trademark red-and-blue hues. The floor plan boasts a blood-red home theater, a gym, elevator, and two guest apartments, and can “easily accommodate a large family or frequent houseguests.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will not work with an international cooperative effort to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine because it does not want to be constrained by multilateral groups like the World Health Organization.


  The decision to go it alone, first reported by The Washington Post, follows the White House’s decision in early July to pull the United States out of the WHO. Trump claims the WHO is in need of reform and is heavily influenced by China.


  Some nations have worked directly to secure supplies of vaccine, but others are pooling efforts to ensure success against a disease that has no geographical boundaries. More than 150 countries are setting up the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, or COVAX.


  That cooperative effort, linked with the WHO, would allow nations to take advantage of a portfolio of potential vaccines to ensure their citizens are quickly covered by whichever ones are deemed effective. The WHO says even governments making deals with individual vaccine makers would benefit from joining COVAX because it would provide backup vaccines in case the ones being made through bilateral deals with manufacturers aren't successful.


  “The United States will continue to engage our international partners to ensure we defeat this virus, but we will not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China," said White House spokesman Judd Deere. "This president will spare no expense to ensure that any new vaccine maintains our own Food and Drug Administration's gold standard for safety and efficacy, is thoroughly tested and saves lives.”


  Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., said the administration’s decision was shortsighted and will hamper the battle to end the pandemic.

 Just as Mackay students were adjusting to the new school year, a spike in coronavirus cases prompted Superintendent Susan Buescher to close school buildings Aug. 26. The closure is in place until Tuesday, Sept. 8.
 "We decided to clean out the school and go remote," Buescher said of Mackay High School, where several cases of the coronavirus were confirmed among staff and students.
 Going to remote learning occurs in the red phase of the school district's reopening plan, Buescher said. The district started out in green, with a full return to school Aug. 18. Face coverings were not required. Buescher said many factors probably contributed to the outbreak in Mackay, but a big part of it was not requiring students and staff to cover their mouths.
 "They're not a cure-all," she said about face coverings, "but at this point we know they slow the spread. I don't know how much they would have helped, but they would have helped."
 Students in the high school building are organized into cohorts and aren't allowed to move around as they have in the past, but Buescher said staff members must be mobile. Staffers became infected, and as they went about their jobs and moved from classroom to classroom they unknowingly spread the virus, she said.
 The tentative plan is to return to school next week at the yellow level of the reopening plan, she said. At that level, students spend three days in school and one day learning from home. Tuesdays are remote learning days, Buescher said. Kindergarten and preschool students will attend school one day each week with one day designated for remote learning. When on campus, students and staff are required to wear face coverings only when 6 feet of physical distance can't be maintained.
 Buescher said returning to school buildings is completely conditional on where Custer County's virus count is next week.

NEW YORK — Walmart is launching a new membership service that it hopes can compete with Amazon Prime.
 Called Walmart+, it will cost $98 a year, or $12.95 a month, and give members same-day delivery on 160,000 items, a fuel discount at certain gas stations and a chance to check out at Walmart stores without having to wait at a register.
 Walmart has a long way to go to catch up with Amazon Prime. Launched in 2005, Prime has more than 150 million members worldwide who pay $119 a year, or $12.99 a month, for faster shipping and other perks, such as discounts at Amazon's Whole Foods supermarkets and access to its video streaming site.
 Walmart's online sales are growing rapidly, especially during the pandemic, when more people have turned to the company to order groceries online and pick them up at a store. But the world's biggest retailer is still a distant second online to Amazon. Walmart is expected to take 6% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, compared to Amazon's 38%, according to market research firm eMarketer.

       The New York Times on Sunday claimed that Taiwan is moving to "revamp its military" and "bolster its armed forces." This will be done to "deter or defeat an invasion" from the Chinese mainland, "with or without American help." However, Taiwan's attempt to collude with the US and use military force to resist reunification is doomed to fail.      Taiwan's military seriously lacks discipline and its combat capacity is also insufficient, despite the island's increasing focus on military strength. Taiwan in August unveiled a 10.2 percent increase for planned defense spending in 2021. During Taiwan's annual Han Kuang military exercises in July, a Bell OH-58D Kiowa helicopter crashed minutes after taking off, killing two. Also, two Taiwan marines were killed and another committed suicide during the exercises. This is hardly a strong force.      These frequent accidents show that there are serious problems in Taiwan's military. These range from a lack of discipline, shortage of training time and insufficient professional skills. In total, these seriously affect their combat readiness. Taiwan's military training and exercises have almost become a show or a child's play. They cannot help improve the island's real combat capability.      More importantly, many of these soldiers do not know whom to fight for. Nor do they know what they are fighting for. They have wavered on this fundamental question. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities are promoting Taiwan secessionism. This will seriously affect the situation across the Taiwan Straits. Many Taiwan military officers and soldiers believe that secessionism has no future. This is also the main reason why Taiwan's military has somewhat lost their combat capability - it has lost its purpose and emotional anchor too.      On Monday, Taiwan released its so-called "China military power report 2020," claiming that the People's liberation Army (PLA) does not yet have the capability to wage an all-out war against the island of Taiwan. This is purely self-deception and is not even worth refuting. The DPP authorities stubbornly adhere to secessionism and have gone too far to collude with the US. They have become the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. This being the case, using military force to accomplish so-called "Taiwan secession" is pure illusion. All Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, will never agree to this wonton fantasy, this bonfire of the vanities.      Sadly, the Taiwan question has become a focus of the ongoing China-US competition. Washington has been hyping this question, and is trying to drive a wedge between Taiwan and the mainland. In August, Taiwan formally signed an agreement with the US arms firm Lockheed Martin to buy 66 F-16V jets. In this crazy deal, the US is blatantly violating the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués by providing military support to Taiwan. This shamelessly undermines China's sovereignty.      Meanwhile, The fact is, selling Taiwan's purchase of F-16V jets to Taiwan will not change the military situation across the Taiwan Straits. Nor will it help the DPP authorities with their silly ambitions of the so-called "Taiwan secession" plan. It is wishful thinking to try to achieve a military balance between Taiwan and the mainland. After all, how can Taiwan compare with the whole mainland?      Furthermore, the American Institute in Taiwan on Monday released two allegedly declassified cables which mention the "six assurances". Among these are assurances that the US, "has not agreed to set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan," and "has not agreed to revise the Taiwan Relations Act," and "has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan," etc.      These are not effective legal texts at all. The US aims to provoke the mainland and give DPP authorities a false illusion that they can move even further on the road of Taiwan secessionism. For decades, the US has been using Taiwan as a pawn to contain the Chinese mainland. Such a trick will never succeed. Ever.      As the US and Taiwan continued to collude with military plans, the PLA responded by conducting massive military drills in the Taiwan Straits in August. These may be a rehearsal of some military actions that may be taken to achieve national reunification. The drills also send a strong warning signal to Taiwan secessionists. The PLA's military modernization has developed rapidly in recent years. Its military standards have been greatly improved with momentous advancements. If any force attempts to separate Taiwan from China, the PLA will resolutely defeat it at all costs to defend national unity. The writing is plainly on the wall—as is the bottom line of their patience.       _The author is a senior research fellow at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn_

The Washington Football Team announced Tuesday that it plans to rename two roads leading to its stadium and training facility after members of its Ring of Fame.


  A main street leading to an entrance of FedEx Field in Landover, Md., will be named Sean Taylor Road. And the address of the team’s headquarters in Ashburn, Va., which is currently 21300 Redskins Park Drive, will change to 21300 Coach Gibbs Drive.


  Both streets will be officially renamed before the team’s opener against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sept. 13.


  The team’s training facility will continue to be called Inova Sports Performance Center.


  The new street names are part of the team’s overall rebranding since July, when it decided that after 87 years it will “retire” its controversial name and will temporarily be called the Washington Football Team.


  The team has begun to remove old signage and logos at its facilities, and on equipment and merchandise, and replaced it with the temporary branding.


  “As we look forward and build a modern identity that everyone can be proud of, it’s imperative that we revere tremendous individuals who have had a positive influence on the franchise and our fan base,” owner Daniel Snyder said in a release from the team. “There are no two people more deserving than Sean Taylor and Joe Gibbs.


  The renaming of these streets, along with all of the changes being made to our stadium, are just part of our long-term goal of improving every element of the Washington Football Team, both off and on the field.”

Twice champions previously, Kolkata Knight Riders are once again in the running as one of the favourites in IPL 2020. Led by Dinesh Karthik, the KKR squad boasts of some very talented youngsters and overseas players which provides a healthy mix for the captain to work with.


  Once again, the likes of Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Karthik and Shubman Gill have a bulk of the responsibility with coach Brendon McCullum raring to go.


  A batting line up that boasts of players such as Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Dinesh Karthik, Eoin Morgan and Tom Banton can only be considered as very able. All of them have the ability to accelerate pretty fast and give the bowlers a handy score to work with.


  Dinesh Karthik (c), Andre Russell, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kuldeep Yadav, Lockie Ferguson, Nitish Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Rinku Singh, Sandeep Warrier, Shivam Mavi, Shubman Gill, Siddhesh Lad, Sunil Narine, Chris Green, Eoin Morgan, M Siddharth, Nikhil Naik, Praveen Tambe, Pat Cummins, Rahul Tripathi, Tom Banton, Varun Chakravarthy.


  Amongst the all-rounders the two easiest picks are Nitish Rana and Sunil Narine, both on their day can be more than effective for the team.


  Kolkata have also got in their team the left arm chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who is extremely difficult to get away and can be extremely dangerous once on a roll. However, he will want to avoid another episode like that with Moeen Ali.


  With world number one Pat Cummins spearheading the pace attack, KKR also have Lockie Ferguson and Andre Russell alongside Indian youngsters -- Prasidh Krishna, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Shivam Mavi and Sandeep Warrier.


  Make no mistake KKR will be a formidable outfit every game and are one of the top bets to make the final four.

  This is not the first time that such an incident has taken place in the sport.

  # Ames puts up tough fight in final match before hiatus: Little Cyclones fall to Roughriders at home


  Joe Randleman


  Ames Tribune


  Senior night didn’t result in a victory when the Ames volleyball team took the court against Des Moines Roosevelt on Monday.


  Playing in its first home meet of the season Ames was defeated in three sets - 25-20, 25-12 and 25-23 to fall to 3-5.


  But the final result didn’t matter. Monday was all about getting a chance to play in front of the home crowd - because it’ll be awhile before it happens again.


  On Monday the Ames School Board voted to begin the 2020-21 school year in a 100-percent off-site Required Continuous Learning delivery model starting Sept. 8. The decision was based on the COVID-19 positivity rates, which exceed the school’s local metrics and those outlined by the Department of Education.


  Because of that decision the Ames fall athletic programs will go through a two-week break with no events following the end of the current week. The volleyball team has no more matches scheduled for this week.


  “These girls work hard and they did everything they could to stay safe and have the season keep going,” Ames head coach Meg Williams said. “It’s just unfortunate it’s going to be cut a little short.”


  Ames took all the COVID precautions required and then some in order to stay safe and give itself a chance at a full season. The players even wore masks during matches to reduce the COVID risk as much as possible.


  “The girls actually made that decision,” Williams said. “We told them during practice you have to wear your mask because you have to stay safe and we want to have as long a season as possible, but I told them during games you don’t have to wear it except on the bench. But they were like nope, we want this season to go as long as possible. We’re going to wear it during games.”


  But through no fault of their own the players will have to sit out a least a few matches.


  “We know life’s not fair,” Ames senior Madelyn Timmermans said. “But we love volleyball so much. Practices too. Having fun is a main goal when we’re playing.”


  So the Little Cyclones made sure to have as much fun as they could playing the game on Monday.


  After losing to Roosevelt at the Skip Anderson Invitational two days earlier Ames felt it was due for some payback on Monday. The Little Cyclones rallied from a 10-7 deficit to take a 12-11 lead in the first set following an Ireland Buss kill and Roosevelt error.


  But Roosevelt used a 4-0 run to go in front for good.


  Losing the first set took the wind out of Ames’ sails entering the second. The Little Cyclones were flat all the way through, falling behind 14-5 and eventually losing by a 25-12 score.


  In the third set Timmermans and outside hitter Lola Campbell helped Ames hang tough early.


  Timmermans and Campbell both came up with clutch kills and Timmermans also had an ace to help Ames build a 13-11 lead. A Rachel Rosaker ace completed the Little Cyclone run.


  “We had to leave it all out there because we knew we might be going on a break here pretty soon,” Ames outside hitter Lola Campbell said. “We wanted to play really hard.”


  But Roosevelt eventually tied the score and went up 24-22. A Tabby Keith kill finished off Ames.


  “I’m really proud of the way the girls played tonight,” Williams said. “The middle set was kind of rough - I think we were expecting to come out on top in the first set and when we didn’t we lost momentum. But the third set was great. They played aggressively and left it out on the floor.”


  Timmermans had six kills and two aces. Campbell also had a big night at the net with six kills and she added two aces and digs apiece.


  “I was just trying to play aggressively and make sure my eye was on the ball,” Campbell said. “Put the ball on the court, but make sure it was aggressive enough that we could get some points for our team.”


  Caroline Wolters had 12 digs and four kills and Rachel Rosacker and Olivia Smalley eight assists apiece for Ames. Smalley was also the top server, 9 of 10 with three aces and Rosacker was a perfect 11 of 11 with two aces.


  Now the Little Cyclones must try to find a way to remain focused until they are allowed to play again. But that shouldn’t be a problem.


  “We’re definitely going to work hard in the two weeks we have off,” Timmermans said. “When we come back we want to show people what we’ve got. I’ve got nothing to lose - this is my senior year. So I want to set a good example, work hard and get some wins.”
