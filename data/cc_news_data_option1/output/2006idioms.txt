If you like strategy games then chances are you already known and enjoy the Civilization franchise. This is a longrunning franchise with the latest entry being Civilization VI. The game originally released in 2016 for the PC platform, but has since moved to other platforms, one of which being iOS. Players can enjoy the full turn-based strategy 4X game right on their tablet and it’s proven to quite a popular game on the iPad. If you’re unfamiliar with this franchise, players essentially guide a civilization from ancient times to modern-day. Of course, it’s a struggle as you’ll have to manage your people, gathering resources, complete different upgrades, and ultimately deal with rival groups that may come up in battle. Of course, there is always the chance you can engage in trading along with negotiations with other leaders, allowing you to avoid conflicts when possible and potentially gaining some allies.

During their discussion, Hermes told the officer she felt she was being ''picked on'' and she was just trying to save her business.
 "You guys are making it impossible to do business,'' she said. "Impossible.''
 Demott subsequently left the building to call a superior officer. He was advised that the store employees were not in violation of state orders and returned to inform that they could continue.
 However, according to Chief Valentine, that part of the conversation was not included on the video that subsequently prompted all the complaints.
 "Unfortunately the video that was released on social media did not portray the entire transaction that transpired between Officer Demott and Mrs. Hermes,'' he said. "The video attracted a tremendous amount of public interest and did not portray the fact that Mrs. Hermes was not charged with any violations related to the Facebook Live incident, and neglected to reveal that she was told she could continue to operate by Officer Demott before he left the scene.”
 “In this matter, the store owner was not singled out by the police, rather the police responded to a specific complaint lodged by another business owner in the borough,” Valentine said. "The officer was just doing his job. He received a complaint, he investigated and the matter was resolved without any further police action being taken at the scene.”
 Valentine said the department has been monitoring compliance with all businesses in town and has been working to support their operations by providing information - and even sharing some of their own masks with essential businesses in need.
 "From day one we have been supportive of our local business community and continue to have strong positive interactions with most of the business owners in town,'' Valentine said.
 But, he added, borough officers "do not have the luxury of deciding what complaints to respond to and what complaints not to respond to.''
 "Nor do we have the luxury of publicly declaring our personal views on orders and laws that are passed as part of our official duties,'' he said. "Our officers have been issued guidance on these matters, but at the end of the day they have a great deal of discretion as to how they enforce the order. They can educate, give warnings or issue complaints if appropriate after the proper screening and authorization occur.''
 Mayor Canose said she had personally received out-of-state calls over the situation.
 She said there has been "very unfair treatment'' of the police department.
 "It's disheartening,'' she said. "They don't have the whole story and the background. That the power of social media.''
 In a second video posted on her Facebook page about the incident, Hermes said she was being fined by police for an elderly woman coming into her shop to pickup some ceramic frogs she had ordered and for an employee coming to the shop.
 The police, she said, were sitting in her parking lot waiting for her to make a mistake.
 She said she is "a law abiding person'' who is working to save a business she spent five years building.
 She also commented on the tremendous response from the video.
 "It's blowing my mind that everyone is being so helpful,'' she said.
 "I'm overwhelmed with your generosity and your orders.''
 As of Friday, the video of the Facebook live session had drawn over 5,000 comments, more than 6,000 shares and 755,000 ''views.''
 Hermes could not be reached by this newspaper for comment on Friday.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday labeled churches and other houses of worship as “essential” and called on governors across the nation to let them reopen this weekend even though some areas remain under coronavirus lockdown. The president threatened to “override” governors who defy him, but it was unclear what authority he has to do so.
 “Governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now — for this weekend,” Trump said at a hastily arranged press conference at the White House.
 Trump has been pushing for the country to reopen as he tries to reverse an economic free fall playing out months before he faces reelection. White evangelical Christians have been among the president’s most loyal supporters, and the White House has been careful to attend to their concerns throughout the crisis.
 Following Trump’s announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidelines for communities of faith on how to safely reopen, including recommendations to limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services outdoors or in large, well-ventilated areas.

Bleachers are to be used only by coaches, players and scorekeepers. Spectators are encouraged to bring their own chairs and to sit around the exterior of the field. Distancing practices are recommended.
 Players are instructed to refrain from high-fiving teammates. That one will be tough to enforce.
 For the time being, teams are forbidden from engaging in the traditional postgame handshake line.
 Oh, and there’s this: Sunflower seeds are banned from the Jenks complex.
 “That limits the spitting,” Gibson explained.
 The Tulsa Little League organization has not yet started its season, which will involve 65 teams. When those 1,000 kids get to play ball, each team will get a typical 12-game Tulsa Little League schedule.
 The Little League season was scheduled for an April 1 start. Now, league official Steve Skocik said, “we’re hoping for a June start. We want the parents to feel comfortable. You go from being locked in to being on a baseball field, and everybody is a little inhibited and cautious. We’re in no hurry.”
 The same distancing and hygiene measures applied in Jenks will be applied at the Tulsa Little League fields, located at 61st Street and Yale Avenue. On Tuesday, one of those fields was used for an Oklahoma Bulls practice session.
 The Bulls are a 13-and-under team with players from throughout the Tulsa area. An elite team like the Bulls usually would play at least 70 games during a schedule that would begin in early March. The Tuesday session was their first actual outdoor practice of the season.
 As these kids had been stuck at home for two months, energy was at a high level. Execution at the plate was better than expected. Several boys blasted shots all over the park.
 The Bulls’ coach is Parker Frazier, the Holland Hall head man. The Dutch’s high school season was canceled after only five games, so Frazier’s current focus is preparing for the Bulls for an Oklahoma City tournament this weekend.
 “We were itching at the bit to get out here and play,” said Frazier, a former Bishop Kelley and Tulsa Drillers pitcher.
 The Jenks tournament participants may have to cope with scattered weekend rain, but 98 teams are determined to get to the finish line of the first major event of the Tulsa youth baseball season.
 While finalizing the Jenks schedule and logistics of the new normal for youth baseball, Gibson is working ahead on a Bixby tournament planned for next weekend.
 Already, 92 teams are registered for that one.
 “I’m trying to find more fields,” Gibson reports. “We want to take as many teams as we can.”

Today’s confirmation of long-gestating plans to rebrand A+E’s H2 network for Vice Media brings the quixotic company further inside the beating heart of traditional TV. But despite the headlong embrace of Vice by the likes of 21stCentury Fox, Disney and Hearst, plus an imminent expansion of its important alliance with Time Warner’s HBO, the fit remains perhaps the most curious of any in the media business. Plenty of industry leaders still can’t quite grasp how Vice has become such a darling.
 In point of fact, Vice has spent more than two decades becoming an “overnight” success. Founded in 1994 as a monthly print magazine in Montreal, the company got religion quickly about the power of digital and pivoted quickly as a way of reaching new, young audiences coveted by advertisers. Of course, fast- rising digital brands are often regarded with suspicion by traditional players and sometimes the wariness is warranted. Once-high-flying AOL swallowed up Time Warner in the poster child of megadeals gone wrong. MySpace’s acquisition by News. Corp. led to little but indigestion. The thirst for relevance and juice, especially among companies seeing erosion in traditional metrics, can easily cloud financial judgment.
 So what path will the alliance with A+E, which now has a 20% stake in the company, travel? (Disney also plans an increased stake, apart from its involvement in A+E.) In some ways, it is purely a marriage of convenience. Viacom alum Tom Freston, is an advisor to Vice and, via his merchant banking firm, the Raine Group, also an investor in the company. He downplayed the significance linear TV would take in the company’s overall portfolio during a panel appearance last April at the NewFronts. “This is a digital-first brand,” he said. “It wouldn’t be the cornerstone of their business.”
 Shane Smith, cofounder and CEO of Vice, agreed during a separate keynote appearance the same day as Freston’s. “Online has shown the good news about TV and the bad news about TV,” he said, “and that’s how everyone fell in love with native ads.” In the official announcement today, Smith noted the venture will bring new capital to fund a range of projects and also empower new approaches to making money from TV. As he put it, the network will be “at the pointy tip of the spear of the rapidly changing terrain of TV advertising.”
 It’s hard to say what form that will take exactly, but as A+E continues to battle ratings slippage and competitive headwinds as the programming world gets ever more congested, Viceland (the network’s working title) offers a ray of hope. For Vice, since A+E troops will largely be at the operational controls, the duty of bringing the network to life will be more of a curatorial one.
 Curation is a concept now on everyone’s lips but one that was woven into Vice’s fabric from early on. To hear from those who have traveled through the open-plan converted warehouse, Vice’s headquarters in the nucleus of hip, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is a remarkable hive of activity. Branded video content, which pays the bills to enable the enterprise reporting and outsider voice that distinguishes Vice’s overall content strategy, is produced by a range of contributors. They are united by lifestyle and ethos more than corporate rank and ladder-climbing. Vice’s hierarchy and corporate culture is unlike that of almost any other TV entity and overhead is kept low. While Smith has earned a reputation for living large, reportedly racking up $300,000 restaurant tabs and buying a mansion in Santa Monica for $23 million and serving as a target for IFC spoof series, _Documentary Now!_ , the company maintains a lean structure. The cachet of being at Vice generally trumps the perks, pay packages and C-suite structures commonly found across the river in Manhattan’s media avenues.
 The resulting profit margins—though shrouded in secrecy—have captivated moguls desperate to kick-start their battered enterprises in a world of instant smart-device gratification. In 2014, Gawker published posts fueled by anonymous reports from staffers and former staffers charging that Vice kept such a tight lid on pay that it created steady turnover in the ranks. While the company posted an expletive-laced rebuttal, the most specific it got was to say that the then-400 employees are paid in a manner “competitive with comparable emerging media companies in the digital space.”
 The headcount has headed northward since then, to more than 1,500 worldwide, still a fraction of that of many peers. A+E CEO Nancy Dubuc today hailed Vice for having a “unique model in the marketplace.” To bring that model to the airwaves, the companies said the production pipeline will be overseen by Spike Jonze. The film and music video auteur got his start making skateboarding videos before ascending the Hollywood A-list to direct studio features like _Adaptation_ and _Where the Wild Things Are_ and co-create _Jackass_ for MTV.
 Jonze promised that Viceland’s hundreds of hours of original programming will offer a unique point of view. Helpfully, from a cost standpoint, the hive in Williamsburg will offer the kind of leverage that other networks distributed on linear outlets to 70 million homes don’t have: Many of the shows announced on the slate, such as _Noisey_ or _Weediquette_ have direct roots in existing series already being produced online by Vice for an attractive cost and eagerly consumed by a hard-to-reach demo. All that remains is the task of scaling that for the MVPD world. If Smith’s merry band can pull that off with help from veteran A+E troops, maybe his blue-skying about a multi-billion- dollar sale or IPO, and his ultimately walking away from day-to-day operations, can become a reality.

“With pieces in place, we were fully ready to accelerate preparations to host the festival this year. However, it became clear that the assurance for public safety would be difficult at best, and we needed to postpone until 2021,” said Brandt Wood, one of the festival’s co-producers. “We had sincerely hoped that Pilgrimage would serve its annual role to bring the community out to celebrate music and, particularly this year, to celebrate coming back together. Alas, the circumstances require us to look to next year for this.
 “We couldn’t be more appreciative of the support provided by the City of Franklin staff and officials, as well as Friends of Franklin Parks over the years, and particularly over the past few weeks as we’ve worked closely together to assess the situation,” he added.
 Pilgrimage is already beginning plans for 2021. “Our goal of becoming an annual cultural institution has been achieved and our desire to continue to evolve the Pilgrimage experience is undiminished,” added Wood. ‘There is simply no substitute for live music and the healing power it can provide. We know people will be more than ready to rejoice in this experience again when the climate improves.”
 Those who purchased early bird tickets will have the option to transfer their tickets to the 2021 event or receiving a full refund, including all processing fees. Pilgrimage will be reaching out to those consumers directly via email over the next week.
 “From all of the Pilgrimage managers, staff, vendors and, of course, the artists, we want to thank everyone for their support over the first five years. We are committed to many more years of great music, local flavor and fellowship in Franklin,” he said.

Advertisers have been flocking to presidential debates, which have been generating huge audiences.
 The debates are on the news networks, but they are attracting advertisers who don’t always run in news programming. And those advertisers are paying top dollar, with CNBC last month reportedly charging $250,000 per 30-second spot.
 After five debates among the Republican and Democratic candidates, the top advertiser has been Universal Pictures, which had two spots on the Republican debate on Fox News Channel Aug. 6, three during the Republican debate on CNN on Sept. 16 and two on CNN’s Democratic Party Candidate debate on Oct. 13, according to iSpotTV.com, which tracks commercials in real time.
 Other advertisers whose ads have been seen multiple times include Sony Pictures, Jos. A. Bank, Men’s Wearhouse, Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Norfolk Southern, CNN, Focus Features, BMW, CBS Films, John Deer, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and BDO accountants.
 Fox Business Network Tuesday night airs debates in which the Republican candidates discuss economic issues.
 The network says it has sold spots to movie studios, automakers, luxury goods marketers, political campaigns and issue advertisers.

The MBTA Board gave final approval Thursday to a $2.29 billion budget for fiscal year 2021, putting in place a plan to use federal funds to help substantially increase spending while officials gauge the the COVID-19 pandemic's lasting impacts.
 Members voted 4-0 during a virtual meeting in favor of the budget, which increases spending by about 7 percent over the $2.14 billion fiscal year 2020 budget but alters plans for several initiatives such as scaling back hiring on bus expansion to grapple with a sharp decline in revenue.
 Budget-writers expect that the MBTA will bring in only 26 percent as much fare revenue as they anticipated in a draft spending plan assembled before the pandemic hit, contributing to a $716 million shortfall from expectations. They also project that ridership will not begin to rebound substantially from its record lows until December or January.
 Operating expenses, including plans to run a full service schedule starting this summer, will exceed standard revenues by about $641 million. However, thanks to about $710 million in one-time revenues -- most of which is federal stimulus funding allocated by the CARES Act -- the T expects a $2.1 million excess.
 The agency could face significant strain in fiscal 2022 if fare revenue does not rebound and if federal dollars are not available to cover the gap.
 The MBTA Advisory Board, an outside group that represents municipalities that help fund the transit system, warned Tuesday that expenses and debt at the T are concerning given the significant revenue questions hanging over the agency.
 During Thursday's meeting, the MBTA Board also approved fare policy changes set to take effect this fall. Fares will cost the same on CharlieCards, paper CharlieTickets and using cash on board, eliminating the surcharge on the latter two options. The T will also allow free bus and subway transfers from Fairmount Line commuter rail stops in Zone 1A and half-priced fares for youth pass riders on that line.
 Officials did not say when in fall 2020 the changes will take effect.

I don't hear any barking, do you? The last I looked at Canes Venatici, this pair of hunting dogs were quiet as can be. They must be sleeping. After all, the only time I see them is after dark.      Canes Venatici, of course, is a constellation, a small one at that, with only two easily visible stars. This pair is easy to find, right under the Big Dipper's handle.      When I say "under" I mean in respect to how the Big Dipper is usually pictured, like a real kitchen utensil right-side up on a table. In late May/early June in the evening, the Big Dipper is high in the northern sky, seemingly upside down as far as utensils go.      From mid-northern latitudes, like where I hang my hat in Pennsylvania (well, place my hat on the shelf), at around 9 p.m. this time of year, Canes Venatici is virtually straight overhead, in the zenith.      These stars are not bright. That may not sound nice, but I mean in magnitude. The star on the left (as seen on a spring evening), on the east side, is brightest. Cor Coroli is +3 magnitude. About 2 1/2 degrees away is +4 magnitude Chara. (A half-degree covers the apparent width of the full moon.)      Cor Coroli is a fine wide double star, a nice sight in a small telescope. The name means "the heart of Charles"; the star was named by Astronomer Royal Edmund Halley, at the suggestion of Sir Charles Scarborough in memory of King Charles I, the deposed British king.      Cor Coroli is a fine double star, easily resolved with a small telescope. The star system is 110 light-years away.      Chara has a yellow hue and is 42 light-years away.      Amateur astronomers love spotting the several relatively bright galaxies in Canes Venatici. The most well known is the Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as M51. It is close to the last star in the Big Dipper's handle and is seen as a hazy spot in binoculars on a dark night. Telescopes of 6 inches and larger easily show M51 with a companion galaxy early attached. Photographs reveal M51 as a grand spiral galaxy, seen face-on.      Astronomers have detected one of the largest almost-empty regions of space, called the "Great Void," in the general direction of Canes Venatici. Containing few galaxies, the void is over a billion light-years wide. Nothing like some "cosmic elbow room."      Take a look low in the west-northwest in evening twilight, about a half-hour after sunset. The bright planet Venus is accompanied by Mercury, which is not quite as bright, about two degrees to the upper left.      On May 23, the thin crescent moon will be below Venus; on May 24, the thickening crescent moon will to the upper left of these two planets, in line. While visible to unaided eyes, the trio will be stunning in binoculars.      Venus appears as a big, thin crescent in even a small telescope at low power.      First quarter moon is on May 29.   Keep looking up at the stars!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

The Stadium Stampede is basically using the fact that there can't be an audience to their advantage and taking the empty arena concept a step further. This is the first-ever empty stadium match and that alone is an intriguing aspect to the card. The only downside of a 10-man match is that a lot of talent is booked for one segment instead of throughout the card. Despite the segment this past week on Dynamite, the Jon Moxley/Brodie Lee match seems to lack the hype of a usual title match. Perhaps, it's because Brodie is being rushed to a title match and this just doesn't have the build up of the prior AEW titles matches on pay-per-view. That being said, if the match delivers in the ring then it's mission accomplished. Most of the under card is fine and all things considered AEW probably did the best they could to sell the show with all the restrictions, but it will be very interesting to see if the event draws a solid buy rate for the company.

Mr. Trump’s demand appeared aimed at Democrats who have drawn his ire, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. Ms. Whitmer banned large gatherings but also said houses of worship would not be subject to penalties, leaving the precarious decision in the hands of religious leaders.
 Mr. Trump’s announcement drew praise from evangelical supporters. “We feel vindicated in the fact that this is what we have said all along, that churches are essential to our communities,” said Jim Franklin of Cornerstone Church in Fresno, Calif., one of the pastors who have vowed to resume services on May 31. “We feel very secure in our position in opening the churches.”
 In North Carolina, a federal judge recently sided with churches that sued over Gov. Roy Cooper’s efforts to restrict religious gatherings to 10 people. In Minnesota, some Catholic and Lutheran leaders have said they plan to restart in-person worship next week in defiance of Gov. Tim Walz’s orders.
 “We hope that local officials across the country will heed the president’s words and respect houses of worship, including our clients,” said Mark Rienzi, the president of Becket, a religious liberty law firm representing the Minnesota churches. “Religion is an essential service for the well-being of society that cannot be subordinated to the economic interests of the states.”
 Other religious leaders expressed more caution. Bishop Kenneth H. Carter, who leads the Florida Conference of the United Methodist Church, said its 700 churches would look at reopening sometime after June 15. “God will reassemble us when we know it is safe. This requires our trust, assurance, maturity, civility,” he said. “Our purpose is to love God and our neighbor. Our purpose is to do no harm, to do all the good we can.”
 Several governors indicated they would make their own decisions without regard to the president’s demand. Mr. Newsom said the state had been consulting with faith leaders and was finishing guidelines to be announced by Monday. “We look forward to churches reopening in a safe and responsible manner,” he said.
 The guidelines, which will distinguish between megachurches and smaller venues, deal with the configuration of pews and “sanitation protocols,” the governor said. “We deeply respect and admire the faith and devotion and the cause that unites millions and millions of Californians, people of faith.”
 In Illinois, Mr. Pritzker said he would “continue to operate on the basis of science and data” when deciding when it was safe to reopen. “I’m as anxious as anybody to make sure that our churches, our mosques, our synagogues open back to where they were before Covid-19 came along,” he said. “We’re gradually moving in that direction. But there’s no doubt the most important thing is, we do not want parishioners to get ill because their faith leaders bring them together.”

On the subject of FCC commissioner Rosenworcel, we were glad the Senate finally got around to holding her renomination hearing last week. We are often not on the same page as the commissioner on issues such as consolidation and network neutrality. But she is a thoughtful and collaborative regulator who is not a party line vote if that line does not square with her own views of what is in the best interests of the industry and consumers. She deserves a swift ‘yes.’

Brazil overtook Russia Friday as the country with the second-highest number of coronavirus infections worldwide behind the United States, as the Americas emerged as a new epicenter of the pandemic.
 The South American country has now registered 330,890 infections and 21,048 deaths from the new coronavirus, though experts say under-testing means the real figures may be 15 times higher or more.
 Brazil's death toll rose by 1,001 in 24 hours, the third time in four days it has come in over 1,000.
 The surge came as the World Health Organization declared South America "a new epicenter" of the pandemic.
 "Clearly there is a concern across many of those countries, but clearly the most affected is Brazil at this point," said WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan.
 The United States has registered more than 1.6 million cases and nearly 96,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.
 Russia has registered 326,488 cases and 3,200 deaths.
 Brazil's death toll is currently the sixth-highest in the world, behind the United States, Britain, Italy, Spain and France.
 But the crisis is not expected to peak in Brazil until June.
 The country of 210 million people has had a disjointed response to the pandemic.
 Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has famously compared the virus to a "little flu," condemns the stay-at-home measures imposed by state and local authorities, saying they are needlessly harming the economy.

Speaking of pay, the game does put players in control of how the money is spent from your job. You can secure certain items such as food or medicine for your family. Likewise, you need to make sure you move enough people through during your job so that you’re able to get a decent wage. Things can ramp up quite quickly, making you decide on tough choices with your funds while also going through the mundane work as an immigration officer. Knowing who to turn away, detain and let in is not always easy. There could be terrorists that have stolen passports and forged paperwork, keeping you on your toes each and every day you start your shift.

John Zimmel has never been afraid to make adjustments to his business models and even completely change directions when necessary. This is especially important during a crisis like the Coronavirus. For example, restaurants that previously avoided delivery services are now deriving their primary income from delivering meals directly to people who are self-isolating at home. While not every business has the advantage of bringing their products directly to their customers, John Zimmel says that it is vital for business owners to think outside the box during a pandemic.

Although not nearly as important as the debate about the health concerns of the public, the genre of sports entertainment has continued to run during the pandemic under specific limitations, yielding mixed results. Since all of this was uncharted territory, it took a few weeks for each national TV group to find a formula that attempted to make the best of the situation. An empty arena match went from being a rarely used gimmick match to the current standard for television. One of the biggest criticisms I had about Wrestlemania and really the WWE product in general with its current presentation is the lack of any reaction in the building is such a flat atmosphere that you just can't build a match. As I've written before, the stripped down version of the product has put a spotlight on some of the flaws of the programming. Without the smoke and mirrors of the state-of-the-art production of the sports entertainment empire, it exposes the lack of quality in the details of the publicly-traded company. This is another example of something that I've discussed several times before, when the WWE became the undisputed leader of sports entertainment and landed major money for its TV deals, including the current contract that will see them get paid nearly $2.5 billion during a five-year span, there was a level of complacency and mediocrity that developed within the product. The corporate agenda, not fan demand determined the direction of programming since WWE remains the most easily accessible pro wrestling product in the United States. However, that generic paint-by-numbers approach is geared toward churning out as many hours of content as possible so there's a priority of quantity over quality. In truth, much of the discontent with WWE is moot because they have guaranteed money that will already see them generate record-setting profits this year, which will boost the stock price. From a business perspective, the WWE is very successful, but are they trading the short-end money now at the expense to build for the future? The point here is, the corporate machine has been running the same playbook for years that it can't adapt to any other scenario. Without the slick production to add some glamour to the show, Raw is reduced to the fact that there just aren't as many compelling characters now and the scripted promos show through even more than usually because of the flat deliver.

Euro 2020 may have been swept from the calendar due to coronavirus, but UEFA's video-game eTournament version kicks off on Saturday regardless.
 Instead of Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane or Cristiano Ronaldo racing around the pitch, gamers will slug it out, contesting the first ever eEuro from their armchairs.
 "The weight of the whole thing is on our shoulders," said 21-year-old Frenchman Lotfi Derradji, who comes from the Paris suburbs but 'plays' for Monaco where he was crowned French champion in 2018.
 "We will represent France not on the pitch but on the console, we're getting huge amounts of support," said Derradji's international and club teammate, Walid Rachid Tebane, who won the individual European title in June 2019.
 "We are disappointed that the Euros have been postponed but at the same time it switches more attention on to us," added Derradji, who has been playing with international French striker - and gaming enthusiast - Antoine Griezmann.
 These two bespectacled eSports professionals earn 2,000-6,000 euros a month, but can boost that with the 40,000 euros up for grabs this weekend and its commercial tie-ins.
 \- Electronic version -
 Using a Playstation console, the group matches are a single two-versus-two contest.
 Matches in the knockout stages will be best of three contests and a mixture of one-versus-one and two-versus-two. The final will be best of five.
 "A Kylian Mbappe will always be more fluid to play with than a Mitroglou but in the game he isn't better than him," explains Derradji, referring to Kostas Mitroglou a Greek striker who is on Marseille's books.
 "It will never replace real football though, let's not get carried away.
 "It's not always easy to convince people about an event where the competitors are sat down."
 But the popularity of on-line games such as Fortnite and League of Legends with a young audience is seen by UEFA as a sign that the landscape is changing.
 UEFA marketing director Guy-Laurent Epstein says the lockdown has been a boon for eSports.
 "The (games and emergence of gamers) represent an opportunity to be seized," he says.
 "We have seen an explosion of events over the past few months because it represents an alternative for sports fans," he told AFP.
 "And some of them have attracted significant audiences."
 He added: "We hope for a minimum of four million viewers over the weekend."
 "We have seen that fans deprived of sports are tuning in to watch esports competitions even if they had never done that before."

SPRINGFIELD -- Illinois' 24 chief judges can decide when to reopen courthouses across the state to in-person proceedings, the state Supreme Court ordered Wednesday.
   
 Each circuit is encouraged to continue holding remote hearings as frequently as possible, an extension of the highest court's previous guidance. But beginning June 1 and in consultation with local health departments, courthouses may hold jury trials, lawsuit arguments and other actions in a courtroom.
   
 The Supreme Court's plan is independent of Gov. JB Pritzker's regional Restore Illinois plan, and gives reopening authority to the head of Illinois' 24 judicial circuits. Schedules in each district should be flexible, according to the order and guidance from chief justices, because "local conditions may change."
   
 "The court realizes that the health crisis is not over, but we must advance justice in a safe and organized manner," Chief Justice Anne Burke said in a statement.
   
 Restrictions implemented to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and "significant levels of backlogged cases" present an obstacle for "most courts for the foreseeable future," the Supreme Court wrote in its guidance.
   
 In a news release, the Supreme Court said "each jurisdiction is uniquely positioned" to address those changes and other obstacles created by COVID-19. For many judicial jurisdictions, that reopening process will be "slow" and many courthouses will "immediately face" challenges.
   
 During the pandemic, the judicial branch of government has used technology not usually embraced by the courts.
   
 "Whatever the new 'normal' brings, a silver lining for the judicial branch is the culture shift in the effective use of video conference technology and remote work capacity," the justices wrote in the guidance.
   
 They suggest considering having judges and attorneys exchange "sensitive documents" through encrypted email, allowing electronic signatures on paperwork and ruling on certain matters without holding oral arguments.
   
 Strategies for in-person proceedings should be made in consultation with local health departments, according to the guidance.
   
 Officials may recommend foot traffic patterns to ensure social distancing, place tape on floors to indicate safe distances for court visitors to stand, and evaluate where court personnel should be positioned. Judges should also limit how many people are in buildings at once.
   
 The Supreme Court advised hand sanitizing stations and Plexiglas germ shields be in place throughout courthouses and that there be more frequent cleanings. Justices also ordered face coverings be mandatory, and entry refused to those who refuse to wear one.
