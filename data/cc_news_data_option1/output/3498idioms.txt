Roman Reigns se proclamó Campeón Universal de la WWE este domingo en el momento más caliente del Payback 2020, celebrado en el Amway Center de Orlando. ‘The Big Dog’ consiguió por segunda vez el cinturón tras salir airoso de un intenso combate ‘no holds barred’, acabando con un breve reinado de The Fiend de solo siete días. Todo se inició entre Bray Wyatt y Braun Strowman en el main event, quienes se desgastaron hasta literalmente romper el cuadrilátero, pero la pelea dio un giro radical tras la aparición de Reigns junto a Paul Heyman. Wyatt, que conquistó el título el pasado 23 de agosto en SummerSlam, perdió el campeonato tras un ‘spear’ de Reigns sobre Strowman. El resultado de la contienda más esperada de la velada dejó inconformes a los perdedores. Bray Wyatt y Braun Strowman reclamaron justicia y dejaron claro que buscarán revancha en las próximas semanas.

 The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is in the works of rescheduling its Test against Pakistan, along with its other Test series, which were forced to be postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
 The Bangladesh board was forced to postpone five of it home and away series, which includes three Tests, while the series against Pakistan consisted of a second and final Test along with a lone ODI.  
 The affected Tests are part World Test Championship and its delay is denting the Tiger's chances.
 BCB CEO Nizamuddin Chowdhury, while speaking to media, said that the board is hoping to reschedule the Pakistan Test and will be in talks with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials to decide a window.  
 "You all know that we were forced to postpone four series [due to the pandemic], against Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Ireland. Other than that we had a Test left to play with Pakistan," he said.
 "This [Test against Pakistan] can be rescheduled easily as it requires a small window. We will discuss that with Pakistan Cricket Board."
