“Some clubs just simply can’t afford it,” Sugar said. “They work from hand to mouth. I know it sounds ridiculous, but they spend every single penny they can on player transfers and player wages and they rely upon the income coming in to pay their bills ... and if you stop the income coming in, then where are they going to get the money from?"

Debido a la falta de implementos de seguridad y para evitar infectarse de COVID-19. Un médico del centro de salud de Pachitea en Piura, elaboró un casco protector con un balde de plástico y compartió el procedimiento a través de las redes sociales. El instrumento fue elaborado con una mica y un balde de plástico que fue cortado en tres partes por el galeno Victor Ocaña Gutiérrez, quien grabó un tutorial para que sus colegas repliquen el proceso y fabriquen su propio casco. “Con una lija se le da acabados a las partes del balde para que no corten...Conseguimos un pedazo de mica. Luego, se coloca la parte más ancha del balde junto al plástico y encima ponemos la asa del balde”, explica Ocaña. El médico advirtió en el video que si llega una 'ola grande de COVID-19’ al país, no habrá equipo de protección para algunos de sus colegas; sin embargo, compartió esta práctica medida como forma de ayuda.

These days, Stoddart is still with Cross Keys as head coach, while he has been involved with the WRU's walking rugby initiative.
 As well as that, he has recently become a property developer- although that's on hold due what's going on in the world.
 "It's something I've been interested in the past. It seemed like a natural thing to do.
 "Bad time at the moment though!
 "But I feel good. I'm looking forward to getting stuck into it full-time when life is back to normal."
 After a decade that would have tested the resolve of most, the future - while delayed for the time being - looks bright.
 It's typical that Stoddart doesn't dwell on the lows of the past 10 years.
 "I look back on it as the same as the decade before. There were plenty of ups and downs and, as always, your plans change.
 "But you just have to adapt and move on.
 "I don't feel lucky but I feel that whatever happens, I can get my head around it and move it."
 Fate has a funny way of doing things, but you could never accuse Stoddart of hiding from his destiny.

Washington D.C. [USA], April 11 (ANI): American model Ashley Graham opened up on the controversy surrounding her 2016 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover.   According to Page Six, the 32-year-old stunner discussed the swimsuit cover during an interview for fellow supermodel Naomi Campbell's 'No Filter With Naomi' YouTube Series on Thursday(local time). Graham, who was the first size-16 model to earn the honour recalled, "There was another model who was so upset that I had gotten the cover and she said I was very large and that women my size should not be on the cover."   The Nebraska native added "You can go look it up," declining to name the critic in question but hinting that her name begins with the letter "C."   It's almost certain Graham was referring to catwalk legend Cheryl Tiegs, who famously slammed her cover.   In 2016, the 72-year-old former SI star told E!News, "Actually I don't like it that we're talking about full-figured women because it's glamorising them and your waist should be smaller than 35 [inches]. That's what Dr Oz said and I'm sticking to it."   "Her face is beautiful - beautiful - but I don't think it's healthy in the long run," Tiegs added.   Later on, the fashion icon faced with backlash tried to clarify her comments and tweeted, "My sincere apologies to everyone I have hurt. I truly just want everyone to be healthy & happy."   Graham was diplomatic when discussing the incident with Campbell. She said, "Of course you're going to get negativity. It brought up a great conversation about what is health? What is beauty? What is sexy?"   Campbell was more direct and told Ashley that she doesn't think that person had the right to say that and it's her time now. (ANI)

It had said that repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual tenor would be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period. Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period, the RBI had said. The plea, filed in the apex court by advocate Amit Sahni, has alleged that the RBI circular is an "eyewash as it provides that the interest shall be chargeable during the moratorium period and it makes no sense in paying additional interest along with the regular EMIs".

Domagoj Vida and Croatia have set their sights on winning the World Cup as they prepare to face hosts Russia in Sochi on Saturday.
 Semi-finalists at France 98, Croatia are on track to at least match that feat ahead of their quarter-final showdown with Russia at Fisht Stadium.
 Boasting the likes of Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Ivan Perisic, Croatia are seen as dark horses to hoist the trophy aloft in Moscow on July 15.
 And confidence is high within the squad after edging Denmark, according to experienced defender Vida.
 "It wasn't our best game. It brought a lot of pressure, especially after loss to Portugal at Euro 2016. We wanted this win a lot. It wasn't easy," the 29-year-old told reporters.
 "Now the pressure is off a bit. We would like to of course beat Russia and, God willing, go all the way to the end. We are close. Our plan is not to stop now."
 Croatia goalkeeper Danijel Subasic was the hero against Denmark as the Balkan nation prevailed 3-2 in a shoot-out following a 1-1 draw.
 Subasic – who broke down in tears after being asked about his t-shirt dedicated to Hrvoje Custic following the midfielder's tragic death in 2008 – kept out three penalties in a stunning display after extra time.
 "We're thankful for what he [Subasic] did [against Denmark]," Vida said. "But it's a team sport and every game brings a different hero.
 "The important thing was that we beat Denmark. Our goals are higher. God willing we would like to lift the World Cup trophy. That's what we're here for."
 Croatia endured a difficult World Cup qualifying campaign, having parted with Ante Cacic following a 1-1 draw against Finland in October.
 Asked about Croatia's turnaround as they eye a final-four berth, Vida added: "We were in a bad situation at the end of qualifying but we knew of our quality and players in our team.
 "With each win our confidence is growing. We believe we can go all the way here in Russia. The support back home is giving us additional energy."

 Vieira however, had harsh words for the striker, telling the Nice-Matin: ''I got him on the phone a few weeks ago and it was arranged for him to recover [here].I Unfortunately, he isn't here.
 ''It's a shame because he spent two years, he has built a very good relationship with the club and the supporters. It's unfortunate it ends as well.
 ''Him wanting to leave is not a problem, it's part of football today. Team- mates such as Seri and Le Marchand, who knew that they changed their club, were present. It was not easy for them, but they worked within the club. For Mario, it ends differently."

Anne - thank you so much for this very useful post. I'm just getting up to speed on a bunch of these, for obvious reasons! I tried Zoom for the first time a couple of days ago - a party of 25 people. It was challenging because it's in no way like real conversation (of course it is real conversation but you know what I mean). At first I was discouraged but, it's come to mind, that we need to get used to all kinds of new communication. When people first do presentations, at work - for example, sometimes it's weird for them but they get used to the rhythm of that interaction. But they do eventually. So I'm hoping I'm going to find my feet in group video chats. And you and G and your dad are just adorable. You have a lovely family!!
