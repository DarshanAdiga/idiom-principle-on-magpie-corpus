While her career skyrocketed with the reality TV show _Newlyweds_ and the rise of her eponymous clothing line, __Simpson's addiction continued quietly behind the scenes. At one point, her doctor even told her that her life was in danger as her alcohol dependency persisted (alcohol misuse is related to more deaths in the United States than drug misuse, and such fatal incidents have dramatically increased over the past two decades).
 Then, during a Halloween party in 2017, she hit rock bottom.
 She recalled telling her friends, "I need to stop. Something's got to stop. And if it's the alcohol that's doing this, and making things worse, then I quit." Her friends gathered her in a group hug. Later, and with the support of her parents, doctors, and biweekly therapy sessions, Simpson worked on overcoming her addiction.

In an unprecedented move, Ottawa police Chief Peter Sloly will ask the police board to approve the fast-tracked hiring of 100 new officers this year by scrapping millions of dollars in funding allocated elsewhere because public safety demands it, according to a report to the police board.
 The report asks the board to accelerate hiring the 30 officers already approved for this year and 70 of the 90 the service intended to ask for in the next three years of police budgets, but to do so with no financial impact to the already approved 2020 budget.
 To do that the force would use money that was allocated elsewhere in the budget -- namely through more than $9 million taken from a workplace modernization plan that the force had previously been reluctant to scrap, one- time funding increasing the take from one reserve fund, and transferring several million dollars from another reserve fund to the 2020 operating budget.
 The announcement Wednesday, in advance of Monday's police board meeting, is one of Sloly's first major moves as chief. Sloly was chief for just days, having been sworn in at the end of October 2019, when the service unveiled the 2020 budget plan. But since then, he's heard repeatedly from officers and the public that staffing remains an issue in how OPS can police the city.
 "There are important concerns being raised by our community and our front-line members and we need to make key investments in officer staffing now to address the issues we are facing and to improve public safety in Ottawa," Sloly said.
 The plan, the service said, would see all 100 officers on the road fully deployed in 2021 and would mean that "priority policing areas like neighbourhood policing, front-line patrol, gun and gang violence suppression and violence against women have the necessary resources to meet current service demands."
 Sloly has already shown a commitment to expanding the service's neighbourhood policing model and had suggested after the year's first homicide that the force would soon be revealing more details of a plan to curb street-level violence.
 Ottawa police said Wednesday that the plan was required to make sure that the service can meet the city's policing needs both immediately and in the long term.
 The move would cost nearly $15 million over four years, but to make sure the force could swing the financial changes, a review of all current projects was done.
 OPS started that review shortly after Sloly took the helm and any projects that were "proving ineffective, did not deliver value or better service to the community, or had a negative impact on morale" and the money they cost were looked at to help make the hiring plan possible. More seats at police college have already been identified for new recruits and Ottawa police recruiters, who will have the task of making sure these positions get filled with quality candidates, are ready to start work to recruit and train these officers.
 As far as the plan to modernize how the service works as an organization -- where the largest chunk of repurposed money is coming from -- police said they would continue that work "by making smarter investments and focusing on priority projects that are core to improving member and public safety."
 In 2016, the board approved the $41.3 million, six-year plan called the "Modernization Roadmap" under a different police command. In 2020, police will taking $9.4 million from the program but still leave it with more than $7 million to deal with a "reprioritized list of projects."
 No new police hiring would occur in 2021 or 2022. The budget for 2023 would be adjusted to ask to hire the remaining 20 officers of the 120-officer plan.

Just this week, we had police officers that came under fire by an individual who’s a convicted felon, who we arrested and had to tase the month before. The same guy, with a firearm. It was stolen. We’ve got to hold people accountable who pose a risk to others. So I’m all about progressive policing—but it’s about being smart, it’s about being appropriate, it’s about being balanced, and it’s about having a focus on keeping people safe and restoring lives, and balancing those two.

The Jan. 16-22 Reuters poll of over 100 economists - taken as business leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos to be greeted by the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts again - showed a significant pickup in the U.S. economy was not on the cards.
 "The recent Phase 1 deal between the U.S. and China suggests decreasing odds of an escalation to a full-blown trade war. However, the deal so far is not comprehensive enough to significantly boost economic momentum," said Janwillem Acket, chief economist at Julius Baer.
 That was also clear from predictions for the Federal Reserve to remain on the sidelines this year and on expectations the next likely move would be a cut rather than a hike.
 "It is almost a one-way bet on the Fed right now, that either they are on hold or they are easing this year. I mean there is virtually no chance of tightening," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities.

“We are doing this to remember over 60 million children who have died from abortion since Roe v. Wade,” said Molly Smith, president of Cleveland Right to Life. “There has been no other, in the history of mankind, such devastation of human life like abortion.”
 The men and women had gathered at the Don Umerley Civic Center before walking about 15 minutes to the four-story building that houses the Planned Parenthood offices. With signs saying “Ban all abortions” held high, they joined together and recited three prayers before walking back to the Civic Center.
 Once there, the crowd listened to speeches from students about their pro-life convictions. They also heard keynote speaker Ron Archer of Archer International Ministries speak about how his mother almost aborted him and how he was saved from it.
 No one from Planned Parenthood addressed the crowd and officials could not be reached for comment before presstime.
 However, the Planned Parenthood in Rocky River, one of 21 in the state, does not actually perform abortions, mainly focusing on sexual education services, according to its website. While the Rocky River site does offer abortion referrals, it provides birth control, testing for sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy testing, according to its website.
 Still, protesters were unmoved in their beliefs when this was brought to their attention.
 “Whether they perform abortions here or not, is neither here nor there,” said Pastor Peter Folger of the Cleveland Baptist Church. “To me, it’s guilt by association. It’s part of who they are and it’s what they do.”
 As a whole, only 3% of what Planned Parenthood does nationally involves abortion. Last year the organization provided abortion services to 393,000 patients nationwide, according to its annual report for 2019. The organization also provided sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment to more than 4 million patients and conducted over 500,000 breast exams and Pap tests, according to the report.
 The march created some verbal scuffling when Judy Cattani posted an announcement about it on a Rocky River community Facebook page Jan. 14. The post generated more than 200 replies.

I think this is a very useful way of organizing things. On paper, we’re still part of the same regime that was established by the nation’s founders. But, in fact, the change that’s coming will be the third or fourth society that’s risen from the ashes, like the phoenix, from periodically breaking down. When the end comes, there has to be a new system, and it has to incorporate the side that was defeated as well as the winners.

Things get weird around the QC (Quality Control) posts, where recent or prospective buyers ask other Redditors to rank the items they've already bought or are thinking of buying. Users post their own (usually harsh) self- assessment of the bag using a _complicated scoring rubric_ while active community members are called upon to reassure or critique them because, as the forum's guidelines state, "We are a community, and you have to contribute and do your part if you want to get something out of it." It's all very, "bless your heart," with comments like, "Personally I would ask for a refund for this bag. I don't think you'll be happy with the flaws. But follow what your bag heart tells you 😊" on a faux Louis Vuitton satchel or "The heart is slightly off on bottom left but I am the person who notices when someone puts on eyeliner!!! Most people wouldn't notice!!!" on a $350 Gucci Marmont dupe.
 Before social media, counterfeit items were purchased down back alleys, or through word of mouth. "My marriage is a fake Fendi!" exclaimed Charlotte in a 2000 episode of _Sex & The City,_ which featured Samantha dragging Carrie to a San Fernando Valley-based fakes dealer. "Even if everyone else knew it was real, I'd always know that mine came from a cardboard box in a trunk," lamented Carrie. Carrie's feeling is apparently a universal one, as RepLadies' posts often stray from on-topic buying and selling of luxury fakes. Many posts read like late night emotional spirals, with titles like, " _Has buying reps made you realize that some of your dream auth handbags are impractical? "_ or " _How to Not Feel Bad About Wearing a Rep_." There's the drama around customs seizure, with posts like, " _Help Rep Fam, Woke Up to This Really Freaked Out_," or trash talking scammy sellers and adding them to a banned seller list.

The global electric bus market is thriving mainly due to growing environmental concerns of the public and various governments. However, among developing countries, China is the only country taking concrete steps to curb vehicular pollution with the introduction of large number of electric buses. A high cost of electric buses is a key barrier for this industry. However, unstable crude oil prices and increasing focus of the transit agencies on minimizing operational costs are expected to lower the impact of the cost factor in the long term. In recent times, certain product launches by companies indicate the increasing level of competition in the industry. The investments of companies and transit agencies are being backed by funding from venture capitalists and governments. This is favoring the growth of electric bus market.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Penn State University has suspended a fraternity while a third-party report of an allegation of sexual assault is investigated.
 University police said Tuesday that an online submission said an unidentified person, reportedly a student, had alleged to a third party having been sexually assaulted by four unidentified fraternity members almost a week earlier at the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity in State College.
 Penn State said Wednesday that its office of student contact has placed the fraternity's Phi Sigma Delta Sigma chapter on interim suspension while the university and State College police investigate. During the suspension, the fraternity will be barred from recruiting members, hosting social events and participating in university functions.

LAWRENCE -- Of all the ugly aspects in the end-of-game brawl between Kansas and Kansas State basketball players Tuesday at Allen Fieldhouse, arguably the most disturbing facet flew somewhat under the radar.                          But Bill Self noticed.                          "It happened in handicapped seating," said Self, speaking after the No. 3-ranked Jayhawks' 81-60 victory over the Wildcats. "If you're going to do something, at least take it on the court or whatever. It's ridiculous that they would go into the stands."                          Ridiculous could well be the word of the evening.                          The Big 12 on Wednesday afternoon suspended KU's Silvio De Sousa 12 games for his role in the Sunflower Showdown throwdown, one of four punishments handed out by the conference -- KU's David McCormack (two-game suspension) as well as K-State's James Love (eight games) and Antonio Gordon (three games) were also reprimanded.                          "This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated and these suspensions reflect the severity of last evening's events," Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby said in a news release. "I am appreciative of the cooperation of both institutions in resolving this matter."                          De Sousa's 12-game suspension followed Self's earlier indefinite banishment of the junior, announced in a news release where the head coach reiterated his disappointment in De Sousa's actions.                          "There is no place in the game for that behavior," Self said in the statement.                          Neither Self nor K-State counterpart Bruce Weber was able to give a full evaluation of what happened Tuesday -- the head coaches were in the postgame handshake line when the incident was sparked -- but both indicated that their own program shares blame for what happened.                          Here is what is known to have unfolded, pieced together through both ESPN's broadcast of the game, additional footage released by the network after the skirmish and clips posted to social media by journalists sitting behind the basket, where the fight originated.                          With three seconds left in the blowout, K-State's DaJuan Gordon stole the ball from De Sousa just past midcourt. De Sousa, however, was able to chase Gordon down and block his shot from behind. But the Jayhawk junior forward was unable to leave well enough alone -- De Sousa hovered over the now-downed Gordon for several seconds.                          That is when the Wildcat freshman forward Antonio Gordon flew into the picture, shoving De Sousa backward and away from freshman guard DaJuan Gordon. Other shoves were exchanged while some players and assistant coaches attempted to play peacekeeper -- both teams had reserves in the game at that point, though each bench cleared and all of those players were subsequently ejected.                          De Sousa appears to escalate the physicality, throwing the brawl's first punch in the direction of Wildcat junior guard David Sloan. The K-State redshirt junior forward Love, inactive and wearing street clothes, engages with De Sousa, and the two appear to throw punches at one another. De Sousa then picks up a metal stool and holds it over his head before dropping it. De Sousa is finally corralled by Self and Jayhawk assistant coaches, the approximately 35-second brouhaha settling down.                          McCormack and KU teammate Marcus Garrett rush to a downed Love near the end of the mayhem, though it is unclear whether the pair engaged with Love physically.                          Both teams left the court through opposite tunnels, but officials forced them to return -- it was determined De Sousa's block went out of bounds with one second left, and the Luanda, Angola, native was assessed a technical foul for taunting. K-State's Pierson McAtee converted 1 of 2 tries from the free-throw line to give the game its final score.                          While punishments remain unfinalized, Self said Wednesday morning on the Big 12 coaches teleconference that KU has had a chance to review "all angles that you could possibly have" of the fight.                          In a news release, KU athletic director Jeff Long called the conduct of a handful of Jayhawk student athletes "simply unacceptable and not reflective of who we are."                          "There is no place for this conduct in college athletics or here at KU," Long said. "I would like to apologize to the Big 12 Conference, Kansas State University, (athletic director) Gene Taylor, Bruce Weber and all fans for the lack of sportsmanship from members of our team this evening."                          Self called his players' roles in the incident "an embarrassment."                          "This doesn't have anything to do with competition," Self said Tuesday. "Those were selfish motives on why that took place at the end."                          Weber shouldered a degree of blame for the incident, though he said DaJuan Gordon and the rest of the Wildcats were told not to press in the final moments with the outcome long determined. Self cited "multiple issues with K-State on this front" -- an end-of-game dunk by KU's Brannen Greene during the 2015-16 season in a lopsided KU victory; an end-of-game dunk by Barry Brown last season in a lopsided K-State victory -- but didn't mention any prior moment by name.                          This situation is "a little different," Self observed, as it was the losing team that attempted the meaningless buzzer-beater.                          "I'm not sure that it's the right thing to do, but I'm not going to place any blame on Gordon going and taking (De Sousa's) ball," Self said. "I mean, Silvio knew he was being defended and he took his ball, and certainly the way Silvio reacted to him taking his ball, going down and blocking the shot, that's all fair game. Horn hadn't gone off yet. But what transpired after that is obviously what set everything off."                          De Sousa, who missed all of last season after being ruled ineligible by the NCAA for violations allegedly committed during his recruiting process, cannot return until Jayhawks' regular-season finale, a 1 p.m. March 7 clash with Texas Tech in Lubbock, Texas.                          A nationally televised black eye on both programs, the incident is one that, if Self were a fan, would do nothing to entice him to watch future college basketball games, he commented.                          "We've seen things like this happen at other places and certainly it gets some attention and you know it's the exception and not the rule, but still, it's inexcusable," Self said. "These things can't happen."                          The lasting image, it would seem, will be De Sousa lifting the metal stool.                          "I was there when that happened, yeah," Self said. "Which is, regardless of what happened, it's a terrible image and there will certainly be consequences for that."                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

 Confidence isn't only rock bottom in the US. Jon Horne, who heads up the 40,000-member European Cockpit Association, said trust in Boeing was _" unequivocally"_ at an all-time low, adding that it was not the role of pilots to do _" PR stunts"_ for the company with rosy testimonies.
 Boeing announced that production would halt for the MAX earlier this month, following several cutbacks, leaving some 400 undelivered planes sitting in company storage facilities, with another 387 complete aircraft grounded at airports worldwide.

Lazio dominated the early stages of the second half, with Immobile having a goal ruled out for offside, but it was Napoli who came closest to scoring with 20 minutes left when Arkadiusz Milik’s header was tipped onto the post by Thomas Strakosha.
 Immobile then compounded a poor night by smashing a presentable opportunity onto the bar with six minutes remaining, before Mario Rui responded seconds later by curling his own shot off the post.
 Simone Inzaghi was left bemoaning his team’s poor luck again when Manuel Lazzari’s deflected shot hit the woodwork and fell to Francesco Acerbi, who was ruled offside after lashing home on the rebound as the hosts held on for a big win.

There is a buzz building around this University of Alabama basketball team.
   
 It's not a roar, or even a din. There has been no window-rattling sonic boom. Last week's two victories have started attracting attention. The home victory over an Auburn team that was previously unbeaten certainly increased the volume. But it was one step.
   
 There is a stronger, larger group of Alabama basketball fans than people realize. There are a core group of supporters who date back to the C.M. Newton days exists primarily in Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. There are others, ranging from those who love any team with "Alabama" on the uniform to basketball devotes raised on the strong history of the sport at the high school level, especially in places that have been hotbeds for years. That includes a broad swath across the far northern part of the state and another in the Black Belt, where rivalries run deep in counties like Wilcox, Sumter, Calhoun and Perry.
   
 Understandably, many of Alabama's loyal backers are also as wary as rabbits in a hedge. They've ventured out a bit this year but are keeping a close eye on this team, focusing on each game potentially painful. The excitement that has been generated has been centered on three things thus far.
   
 First, there is the sheer entertainment value of a team that is currently playing at the fastest tempo, by far, of any high-major team in the country, faster than any Crimson Tide team in 50 years (only some of Mark Gottfried's early teams came close.) Second, there is a strong in-state element on this team. Many fans have watched John Petty, Herb Jones, Kira Lewis and Alex Reese since they were ninth-graders. Bruce Pearl mentioned them last Wednesday as players that Auburn had recruited and could not sign. So a tip of the hat goes to Avery Johnson (and Antoine Pettway) for recruiting them and another to Nate Oats for the marked improvement all four have shown this season.
   
 January Bracketology is a contradiction in terms since there are hundreds and hundreds of games still to be played that will potentially impact the final NCAA Tournament bracket. Still, there is no harm at sneaking a peek at some of the current metrics. The NCAA Net rankings released Monday had Alabama at No. 42. That brings us from the broad view down to particulars. One thing the Crimson Tide needs are a few wins outside the state of Alabama. Protecting the home court in SEC play is great but at the moment, UA has exactly one win that came somewhere other than the state of Alabama, a neutral-court win over Southern Miss, perhaps the least formidable opponent that UA has faced this year.
   
 That's not to suddenly load this Wednesday's game at Vanderbilt with massive expectations but it is fair to call it an opportunity. As always, the rabbit ears of the fan base will twitch a bit when the Crimson Tide takes the court in Nashville at a gym that has been a historic house of horrors for Alabama. Last year, the Crimson Tide won there -- remember Riley Norris' game-clinching 3-pointer, complete with air-guitar solo. That won't necessarily calm all nerves this year. Neither will Vanderbilt's 0-for-25 3-point shooting against Tennessee last Saturday, which has Law of Averages believers expecting a 14-for-19 effort out of the Commodores.
   
 Alabama, though, will be the favorite, favored to take one more step that will perhaps turn up the volume on the buzz, at least a little bit more.

Amtrak makes one space available on each rail car, to meet its obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. That law, which turns 30 this year, prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in jobs, schools, public accommodations and transportation. A business is required to remove barriers when it is easy to do. A business is exempted from making such accommodations when doing so creates an "undue hardship." That's defined as a significant difficulty or expense. The rule of thumb is that a business should expect to make back the cost of an accommodation in added business, like a restaurant that adds a ramp at the front door. As a result, businesses don't charge people with disabilities more than anyone else.
 There have been rare exceptions. Amtrak faced a similar case in 2005, when another disability advocacy group booked a train from Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C. Amtrak said it would need to remove six seats from the train to accommodate the 12 passengers in wheelchairs. It added a $200 surcharge for each seat it needed to remove. The group, Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania, sued and a court ruled in favor of Amtrak.
 NPR first reported the story of the $25,000 ticket charge on Friday. That led to criticism, including from U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth. The lllinois Democrat is the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety, which has jurisdiction over interstate transportation. Duckworth, an Army veteran, uses a wheelchair because of injuries from the downing of a Blackhawk helicopter she was co-piloting in Iraq.
 On Sunday, Duckworth called Amtrak's charge "outrageous" and asked for a meeting with Amtrak's CEO, Richard Anderson.
 On Monday, Amtrak said it would waive the $25,000 fee and find room for the added wheelchair users on the train. Then this afternoon, Amtrak said it would end the policy that led to the big bill in the first place.

The Founders "knew what it was like to live under a despot, and they risked their lives to be free of it. They knew they were creating an enormously powerful executive, and they knew they needed to constrain it," Schiff said.
 The Republican majority is expected to acquit Trump on the House's charges - that he abused his office and obstructed Congress by bartering military aid for Ukraine's help against his political rivals - yet the rare indignity is certain to undermine his legacy.
 Trump's lawyers did not file any motions before the Senate's 9 a.m. deadline, confirming that they will not seek a vote dismissing the charges against the president before opening arguments. Several Republican moderates had signaled they would oppose a dismissal. Those in reelection races this year, especially, did not want to appear to be ignoring their constitutional responsibility to conduct a trial.
 On Tuesday, in a session that lasted until nearly 2 a.m. Wednesday, Republicans approved a rules package along party lines that punted decisions about calling new witnesses until the end of next week. Each side is to present opening arguments stretching over days. Afterward, senators have up to 16 hours to submit written questions to lawyers for both Trump and the Democratic House impeachment managers prosecuting the case against him.
 Though Trump reiterated to reporters at Davos that he would love to call more witnesses, he has repeatedly directed administration officials to defy subpoenas for documents and testimony.
 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., excoriated Republicans for limiting House managers' ability to call witnesses and introduce evidence unavailable to the House before its impeachment vote in December. "They want it in the dark of night. They want as much of this hidden from the American people as possible," he said at a Wednesday news conference. But he said Republicans plainly feel pressure, citing the fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was forced Tuesday to soften the trial rules and allow more days to present arguments.
 Schumer said Democrats would negotiate with Republicans over witnesses but would resist efforts to call Joe or Hunter Biden as part of a deal. He did not rule it out completely. "You know, we don't need to have witnesses that have nothing to do with this that are trying to distract Americans from the truth," he said.
 But Schiff rejected the idea that Democrats would agree to calling the Bidens in exchange for Bolton and administration officials. "This isn't like some fantasy football trade," he told reporters. "This isn't 'We'll offer you this if you give us that, we'll offer you a witness that is irrelevant and immaterial, who has no relevant testimony, but a witness that will allow us to smear a presidential candidate, if you want to get a legitimate witness.' That's not a trade. Trials aren't trades for witnesses."
 Schiff, during his opening statement, pointed to House testimony from Trump's former ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who said everyone in the administration, including Trump, was "in the loop" as part of the president's effort to pressure Ukraine.
 "The president was the key player in the scheme. 'Everyone was in the loop.' He directed the actions of his team," Schiff said. "He personally asked a foreign government to investigate his opponent. These facts are not in dispute."

As always, the rabbit ears of the fan base will twitch a bit when the Crimson Tide takes the court in Nashville at a gym that has been a historic house of horrors for Alabama. Last year, the Crimson Tide won there -- remember Riley Norris' game-clinching 3-pointer, complete with air-guitar solo. That won't necessarily calm all nerves this year. Neither will Vanderbilt's 0-for-25 3-point shooting against Tennessee last Saturday, which has Law of Averages believers expecting a 14-for-19 effort out of the Commodores.
 Alabama, though, will be the favorite, favored to take one more step that will perhaps turn up the volume on the buzz, at least a little bit more.

Stark contrasts. But Manning was the same nice, humble guy both times.          I asked him last July right off the top if he had some age, or date, in mind for how much longer he intended to play.          Nope.          "I've never thought about it as getting to a certain age," Manning said. "You just don't know.          "I know I want to keep playing, and then I think eventually one day you'll know you don't want to keep playing, depending on what happens, or you just may say, 'It's time to hang it up.' And whenever that day comes you'll know it, or be forced into it, one way or the other.          "Right now I love what I'm doing. I don't want to do anything else."          But what I'll remember most about Manning that day -- maybe even over his two famous Super Bowl completions -- was watching him compete on the practice field an hour or two later, under that hot July sun.          Manning was in total command, his face dripping with seriousness and purpose as he ripped hard, pinpoint passes into receivers' hands -- left and right, short and deep.          He wasn't goin' down without a friggin' fight. It was cool to see.          Mr. Nice Guy? Off the field, sure. But on the field? Peyton had nothing on Eli.

I think those messages have to be taken into the kitchen and shared firsthand as to why utilization and waste is so important.”

Peter Stiepleman, always the innovator, is discussing once again the prospect of conducting school all year around, with a focus on Blue Ridge Elementary as the possible first out of the box.
 Principal Mark Burlison is interested in the idea, and in the management culture prevalent at public school systems, at least in Columbia, reforms of this kind are not pushed through unless school building principals are on board, or even instigators.
 For years school reformers have questioned the waste of infrastructure inherent in the traditional practice of using facilities only part-time during the calendar year, brought on largely through the preference of parents who welcome their time off from school duties during the summer. On the other side of the issue is a growing awareness of what some educators call "summer slide," the well-known loss of educational gain many students suffer during summer vacation. The summer slide and the challenge of keeping infrastructure up with the pressure of growing student populations is enough to keep creative planners awake at night.
 If it were not for system affordability problems most parents and students, I daresay, would prefer to keep the status quo with summers off for more leisurely family pursuits, but soon enough many are bound for continuing their education at higher education venues where year-round school will be the norm.
 K-12 education officials also discuss adopting four-day-a-week calendars, hoping to spread out use of school facilities to accommodate more time in class. I have no valid information indicating whether this is a more or less popular option among students and their parents, but it will have to run the gamut of potential change, a challenge any substantial reform must weather.
 Parents can be sure their attitudes on these issues will be heard and heeded, but so far in Columbia no strong and obvious consensus has appeared favoring either four-day or year 'round attendance. The case for one or the other, or both, has enough appeal to make me think these options will remain on the agenda with some degree of interest from now on.
 Taxpaying parents have a fundamental interest in school operation efficiency, which will make them somewhat open-minded about ways to make school budgets go further, but of course public officials always find it hard to show palpable connections between potentially unpopular reforms and budgetary efficiency.
 So, these ruminations are intended to urge public acceptance for the challenges facing Stiepleman & Co. as they do mind exercises of their own about the future of public school operations. We have learned Peter and his crew will communicate well with the public about various options, letting us know none is a slam-dunk with nothing but upside.
 Most important, Columbia public schools will continue to deliver high-quality K-12 education regardless of calendar details at each building.
 The primary challenge for students and parents is to make the most of the experience. Many, or most, will depend entirely on K-12 education to equip them for their lives ahead, a prospect they can regard with optimism if they graduate from public schools hereabouts.

FARMINGTON-After the Farmington Township Board decided against continuing with the sale of their building, Farmington City Council members discussed Monday the future of the Municipal Building.
 During a special Public Buildings & Grounds Committee, Aldermen considered their next step.
 The current Municipal Building, located on West Fort Street, is in need of costly repairs. The City's previous plans had included purchasing the Township's building to house both City and Township offices and also purchasing the former Ulm's Veterinary Clinic building to house the Farmington Police Department.
 The Township would have paid $250 in rent for the first five years then rent would increase in $25 increments until a cap of $500 is reached.
 However, these plans fell through as members of the Township Board voted against holding a special town meeting to sell their building to the City.
 Trustees had expressed during its meeting Jan. 13 that their building would be paid off in 2028.
 "Initially we thought there'd be a savings but once rent gets to $350, the building would have been paid for," said Trustee Richard Hitchcock that night. "From that standpoint, we'd get short term help and in the long term, it doesn't really help."
 The Township Board's attorney had also questioned the proposed lease agreement, including a lack of definitive term lengths and no provisions for who will pay for utilities, insurance and maintenance.
 Monday night, Ward 2 Alderman Leslye Smith gave an update on what occurred during the Township Board's meeting.
 "They were dead set against it," Smith said. "They like having their own building and they were afraid the City was going to come in and tell them what to do."
 Ward 2 Alderman Kenn Stufflebeam commented that he had thought the Township approved of the proposed agreement during negotiations.
 "It's water under the bridge," Stufflebeam said. "We want a good relationship with the Township."
 Stufflebeam suggested moving City offices and the Police Department to the north end of the structure where there is more room.
 Currently both entities use the south side of the structure. The entire building formerly housed the school. The other wing of the building is rented out to the YMCA with the connection portion being inaccessible due to its poor condition.
 The parts of the building not needed would be sold, Stufflebeam said.
 "There could be a big portion of this block available for development," he noted.
 City Administrator Rollen Wright said there is $680,000 in the City's budget available for either rehabilitating the current structure or building new.
 He suggested that one councilperson and department heads meet with Tom Armstrong, a general contractor, and a mechanical architect to confer on plans and create a blueprint. There is no estimated cost provided yet.
 It was also noted at the meeting that Otto Baum Company would visit the Municipal Building this week to look at the structure.
 During the Council's regular meeting later that night, Aldermen approved proceeding with engaging with Armstrong Builders.

LONDON - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer knows how badly he's doing at Manchester United. However, the manager can't seem to find any solutions.                          “When you're at Man United there's always going to be criticism,” Solskjaer said after a 2-0 loss to Burnley on Wednesday. “We can't do anything but hold our hands up and say, 'This isn't good enough for this club.'"                          United's first loss to Burnley at Old Trafford since 1962 came on the back of Sunday's defeat at Liverpool and left the club in fifth place, six points from the Champions League places.                          United seemed helpless as Chris Wood and Jay Rodriguez scored either side of halftime.                          “The boys have given everything they've got,” Solskjaer said on BT Sport television. "They are experiencing this period for the first time in their lives, some of them.                          “It's very, very difficult for them. The expectations of this club as well are high, and some of them have played 10, 12 or 15 games and it's not easy for them. Of course I'm going to back them. I'm going to be here to help them get through this.”                          That might not be up to Solskjaer, though, after a night when fans turned on the owning Glazer family with abusive chants.                          “Stand up if you hate Glazers," was one of the milder chants against the Americans, who have owned the club since 2005.                          Solskjaer was brought in by United to succeed Jose Mourinho in December 2018 seemingly on the basis of being a former title-winning player under Alex Ferguson. His managerial experience in the Premier League amounted to being relegated with Cardiff in 2014.                          United rushed into handing Solskjaer a permanent contract in March 2019 despite no risk of losing the coach. Since then, he has lost 12 Premier League matches and won 11.                          “We're fifth in the table, but of course we work every day with these boys to improve and get us performing better than this,” Solskjaer said. “We're looking to improve, definitely.”                          TOTTENHAM DROUGHT ENDS                          Tottenham moved level on points with United after ending a four-match winless run in the Premier League with a 2-1 victory over Norwich.

 What happened to the Karth family is called an underride crash. That’s the name given to crashes when a car slides underneath a tractor-trailer.  
 The U.S. requires rear guards on the back of all semi-trailers, but the guards rarely hold up in a crash. Underride crashes are often deadly.
 Statistics aren’t tracked, but in a series of investigations on the issue, WUSA-TV discovered the trucking industry itself admitted during a trial that more than 200 people die every year in underride accidents.
 Rebekah and her family say the technology exists to make the guards stronger. They have spent years lobbying Congress to tighten regulations.
 “We realized as a family that you can fight the one truck driver who caused this or you can fight the systemic issue that’s the ongoing problem as a public health matter,” she said.
 Despite having bipartisan support, little had come of their efforts until now.
 Lawmakers are considering tying tighter regulations to a 2020 transportation funding bill and a national trucking industry now says it’s open to tougher standards on rear guard rails.
 “This is my sister’s legacy and we want to honor that legacy,” Rebekah said. “The best way we can do that is to give their lives meaning.”

PLYMOUTH - Pinehills Managing Partner Tony Green was in good spirits last week as his partnership with Brookfield Properties and New England Development yielded results - big results.
 Brookfield Properties has been awarded master developer with New England Development and Green's company Green Southfield as partners in the redevelopment of the 1,400 acre former Naval Air Station South Weymouth, which closed in 1997. The Southfield Redevelopment Authority voted unanimously for Brookfield Properties as master developer of the site, known as Union Point.
 Located in the towns of Weymouth, Rockland and Abington, redevelopment of Union Point - formerly SouthField - has been anything but a smooth ride as one after another master developer has been unable to gain altitude with any number of plans.
 The latest multi-use project posited a smart city with 4,000 homes, commercial space galore, green roofs, hiking trails and ponds. Everything from a college campus to a sport complex and theater were proposed. But the plan stalled as others had, and the SouthField Redevelopment Authority went searching for another master developer.
 "We have the master developer designation and have the opportunity to go through a master planning process with the SRA and all three towns to re- envision something that would be terrific and would work there," Green said last week.
 The property is located west of Exit 14 on Route 3.
 According to its write-up, Brookfield Properties boasts 50 master planned communities and $200 billion in assets, and has developed 450 million square feet of commercial space, manages 60,000 apartments, has 40,000 million square feet of development under construction and has 19,000 employees.
 New England Development has constructed 4,000 multi-family units in the state, has developed $2 billion in real estate, manages 50 million square feet of leasable space and takes a collaborative approach on projects, according to its write-up. Seeking input from community leaders and partnering with state and city entities, neighbors residents and tenants has resulted in projects that are well received and successful, according to New England Development.
 Green Southfield, Green's company, has developed 3,065 homes as well as 1.3 million square feet of mixed-use space and has added $1.35 billion to Plymouth's tax base. The Pinehills nets the town of Plymouth more than $22 million in tax revenue annually.
 As managing partner of The Pinehills, Green was instrumental in the vision, master planning and approval process for this multi-use village. Green has a master's degree in planning from Harvard, is past chairman of the Residential Neighborhood Council at Urban Land Institute and has lectured on land development and planning at MIT, Tufts, Harvard, Duke and the Environmental Protection Agency.
 Green said that in recent memory three different development companies tried their hand at Union Point and failed. He said his team is not yet sure what the specific plan will be. Talking to the communities and getting a solid read from the stakeholders is an important first step.
 "We know there's a village center component and a housing component and some more commercial beyond that, but we haven't gone through the planning process yet, so you don't know," he said.
 Green noted that his team's broad range of experience in a variety of large projects make it ideal for Union Point and the many facets that will need to be addressed. He's looking forward to this, he added.
 A portion of the Union Point already features 1,200 single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The three towns are hoping this three-member team does what the others haven't been able to do - finish the project.

CEO David Calhoun said Wednesday that the assembly line will start back up "a few months" before then. Calhoun also believes passengers will fly on the Max when federal regulators say it is safe and they see airline pilots getting on the plane. Calhoun took over this month for former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who was fired in December over Boeing's halting response to the Max crisis.                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

This past week a Major League Baseball investigation concluded that the 2017 Houston Astros cheated to win the World Series. They stole signs that catchers put down to let the pitcher know which pitch he should throw (curve, fastball, changeup, slider, etc.) through an elaborate electronic system of cameras, and then players banging on trashcans in the dugout to alert batters of what was coming. It is the greatest cheating scandal in modern baseball history. Only the 1919 Black Sox affair, in which eight members of the Chicago White Sox took mob money to throw the Series to the Cincinnati Redstockings eclipses it. And maybe not even that, as only part of the team was implicated. It is clear now that _everyone_ in the entire Astros organization was part of the scheme to steal a title. All eight men on the White Sox were banned from baseball. Those guys didn’t have a union. Current players do. Thus, they were granted immunity to come clean. They did. They told MLB that they all cheated, all season, and during the playoffs. They admitted that their individual achievements and their team title were a complete and utter fraud. So, Astros owner Jim Crane, in a CYA move for the ages, fired manager, A.J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow after the league fined the team, took away draft picks, and suspended those gentlemen for a year. However, the counterfeit title stands. Again, it was a fraud, but there it is, in the record books.

MINNEAPOLIS — The Timberwolves went to the same well multiple times late during Monday’s loss to Denver.
 They repeatedly ran a set designed to get Karl-Anthony Towns the ball at the top of the arc, lined up against Nuggets’ center Nikola Jokic.
 In such a spot, Towns can either take the straight-on 3-point shot, or go at Jokic off the bounce.
 It wasn’t exactly pretty, but the set did lead to a Towns triple with 4 minutes, 30 seconds left in the game.
 It worked to perfection 90 seconds later. Towns handed the ball off to Shabazz Napier, who passed to Andrew Wiggins and quickly set a screen for Towns, allowing the Wolves’ 7-foot center to get the ball up top. Towns drove past Jokic, scored at the rim and was fouled. He made the free throw to bring Minnesota within four of the Nuggets.
 The very next time down the floor, the Wolves appeared to try to run the set again, this time with Towns handing off to Wiggins. But when Wiggins passed to Napier, he was slow to get over to screen for Towns, and then didn’t even set a screen. And Josh Okogie ended up in the same area. It ended in a log jam. Wiggins eventually got the ball instead of Towns, and ended the possession by missing a contested shot.
 “We scored two straight times,” Saunders said. “We tried to run it again, and we just weren’t able to execute.”
 That’s been an issue for the Timberwolves in recent late-game situations. Over their past four games that featured “clutch” situations — in which the game was within five points in the final five minutes — the Timberwolves are averaging just 70 points per 100 possessions, far and away the lowest mark in the NBA. They’re being outscored by 41 points per 100 possessions in that span.
 Minnesota has been outscored by five-plus points in the final period of three of its past four games, all contests in which it was in contention heading into the fourth, and all four ending in defeat.
 “It’s the execution portion of things that we just need to become better at down the stretch, and we need to grow with that,” said Saunders, who vowed the Timberwolves would address that in Tuesday’s practice. “We’ll focus on that within our fourth-quarter segment, because that’s hurt us. You might feel a little bit differently had some of those plays not been empty possessions. A lot we’re leading into live-ball turnovers where the opposing team is able to score in transition, and those are back-breakers for you.”
 Towns noted after Monday’s loss that the fourth quarter “is different.” Minnesota seems to realize that, but fails to do anything about it.
 “Mental mistakes,” Jarrett Culver said. “(It’s) just making sure we eliminate those and get a shot up.”
 A good shot. Those have been harder to come by for the Timberwolves in deciding moments of close contests. Perhaps it’s because opposing teams lock in defensively late, and many of the open looks the Wolves get throughout the game are no longer available. Perhaps it’s because Minnesota’s go-to guy is a center, a position NBA teams seem to have an easier time containing in late- game situations than, say, a dynamic guard who can break a defense down off the dribble.
 Whatever the reason, the Wolves need to find an answer to combat it. Because while they keep continuing to put themselves in positions to win games, they continue to come up empty in the final minutes.
 “You want to make sure that, as young players come together, you can’t fall into the youth and experience trap late in games,” Saunders said. “You need to find a way to compete against these other guys, because nobody is checking how old you are late in games.”

"You were talking in your sleep last night," I said to my husband when he stumbled into the kitchen that morning. I handed him a cup of Espresso to jolt him out of his coma.
 "No, I wasn't," he said.
 "How would you know," I said. "You were asleep. I was not asleep … because you were talking in your sleep."
 "I don't talk in my sleep," he said as he sat down at the table. The dog came over for a scratch behind the ears or maybe just to take my husband's side.
 "Well, you did last night," I said. "And you were very adamant about it."
 Now my husband was interested. I'm sure he thought he had perhaps divulged some husband secret from deep within his subconscious, like, the fact that he purposely hangs the toilet paper the wrong way just to make me crazy.
 "What did I say?" he wondered.
 "Begone," I replied.
 "I said 'begone?'" he repeated.
 "Yes."
 He shook his head. "I would never say 'begone.' I'd say 'Get lost,' but I wouldn't say 'begone.' I think you heard it wrong. Maybe I said, 'poupon.'"
 "Were you dreaming about mustard?" I said.
 "Unlikely," he admitted. We were both silent as we wondered what had inspired him to yell out "begone" in his sleep. Maybe he had dreamed he was a king's attendant in a Shakespeare play, or a French knight in a Monty Python movie. Perhaps he was a hobbit standing his ground in the Shire, or a constable clearing the cobblestone streets of Old England from lollygaggers. Or maybe he dreamed it was 200 years ago and I was berating him for hanging the toilet paper the wrong way and he yelled at me to "begone."
 This wasn't the first time he had talked in his sleep. There was the time he did a musical countdown and conducted an orchestra while he slept, smacking me in the face as he directed the string section. Another time he yelled out, 'Who's there!" and I jumped out of bed and hid in the closet thinking there was an intruder in the house. And one time he told me to bring the camels inside, even though we lived in the suburbs and we weren't zoned for domesticated desert pets.
 Sleeping with my husband was not restful, but it was certainly entertaining.
 "Did I say anything else," he asked, hoping for some insight into the source of his nocturnal mumblings.
 I thought for a moment. He had said some other things but mostly under his breath so I couldn't make them out.
 "I don't know," I finally said. "Maybe I dreamed it."
 "Probably," he said. "'Cuz I would never say 'begone.'"
 "Okay. Anyway, honey, I have to run," I said, putting on my jacket. "I have an appointment. Would you mind taking the dog out?" I thrust the leash at him.
 "Fine," he said. "Begone."

At least 19 people were killed Wednesday when suspected nomadic Misseriya herders from Sudan attacked a village in the disputed oil-rich region of Abyei along the border of South Sudan, according to UN peacekeepers, although local authorities gave a much higher toll.
 Abyei has been contested since South Sudan gained independence in 2011, while there have long been tensions between the South Sudanese Ngok Dinka community and the Misseriya herders who traverse the area looking for grazing.
 The United Nations Interim Security Force in Abyei (UNISFA) which has been deployed to secure the area since 2011 said in a statement that "19 people are reportedly dead and 25 wounded while three children are reportedly missing and 19 houses burnt from the Dinka community."
 However Kuol Alor Kuol, the chief administrator of the Abyei area, told AFP that the number of dead stood at 32.
 "Thirty-two people were killed among them children and women, and secondly about 24 people are wounded ... and about 15 people including children were abducted and 20 houses burned," Kuol said.
 He said the wounded had been evacuated to a hospital in the town of Agok which is run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
 The UNISFA statement said it had received reports that many armed Misseriya and Dinkas were currently converging in the general area of Kolom.
 "UNISFA troops have been deployed in the general area of Kolom to control movements and contain the situation."
 The peacekeeping operation said a similar incident on Monday had left three people dead in the area.
 In 2011, the UN Security Council deployed the peacekeeping force to the area after deadly clashes displaced some 100,000 people.
 UNISFA is made up entirely of Ethiopian troops, with some 4,500 soldiers on the ground.
 The statement said the incident came amid efforts to hold "co-existence conferences" between the two communities and was "very worrisome and a great cause for concern to the mission."
 "The United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) strongly condemns this attack as it can only contribute to the tension and chances of renewed violence in the area."
 Sudan's government spokesman Faisal Mohamed said in a statement that the attack was "unacceptable".
 "The government of Sudan will play its role in protecting civilians and calls UNIFSA to move immediately to the village to protect the civilians there," he said.
 Meanwhile US Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Tibor Nagy called on Twitter for "calm and restraint" in the area.
 The UN Security Council in 2018 warned that the situation in Abyei and along the Sudan-South Sudan border "continues to constitute a serious threat to international peace," and called on the two countries to show concrete progress on border demarcation and monitoring.

Illinois began allowing recreational cannabis sales on New Year's Day, and the experience has been enough to induce the sort of giddiness users have been known to exhibit.
 Long lines confirmed a lot of pent-up demand for legal weed, and sales the first week amounted to $12.9 million -- higher than (um, in excess of, we mean) the first week's revenue in any other state. "It is a really strong indication that the market is going to be very, very healthy here," Bethany Gomez of cannabis research firm Brightfield Group told the Tribune's Ally Marotti. In the first 12 days, the total was $19.7 million.
 The downside is many dispensaries soon ran out of recreational supplies. Some have had to turn away customers or limit purchases.
 The sales surge is reassuring in a way. It suggests lots of people were eager to get their pot from regulated sellers, despite the higher prices, rather than from the illicit dealers who previously had the market to themselves. All those purchases yield a harvest of sales tax revenue. They also should prevent the harms to health caused by adulterated products from black-market dealers.
 Hopeful indicators are no reason to get carried away, however. Illinois is conducting a large social experiment, and it will take time to find out exactly how positively or negatively it will play out. A few weeks into the legal weed era is way too early to relax the rules.
 That's why we're relieved Mayor Lori Lightfoot has decided not to push forward with a proposed ordinance to allow on-site consumption. In her plan, in accordance with limits in the state law, tobacco shops, hookah lounges and other such shops could let patrons smoke pot. They would have to provide appropriate ventilation in standalone buildings; they'd have to pay $4,400 for a license every two years and most of downtown Chicago would be off-limits.
 The alleged problem on-site consumption would address is the shortage of places where people can smoke cannabis. Toking isn't allowed in public places, including parks, schools, government buildings, buses, trains and anywhere minors are present. Landlords are allowed to ban it as well. Smoking of any kind is illegal in restaurants, bars, stores, theaters and most hotel rooms. The only place you can be sure of getting to blaze a blunt in peace is in a home you own.
 The city has plenty to worry about right now without taking on that issue. Only two states, Alaska and Colorado, have elected to permit pot consumption sites, both recently. Illinois could benefit greatly from waiting to see their results there before deciding whether to follow suit by authorizing more establishments to allow pot smoking.
 These states may find that such venues produce headaches for neighbors, as rowdy bars do. It may be that most users are content to partake in their rec rooms or on their patios. On the other hand, it may turn out lots of people will pay to smoke weed in places designed for communal enjoyment. We just don't know.
 Learning from the experience of other states can save us from mistakes. Illinois, including Chicago, is just getting the chance to learn for itself what legal pot means. With time, we'll find if adjustments to the rules are needed. For now, the best policy is patience.

HINGHAM -- Buying the historic General Benjamin Lincoln house could soon become a reality for the Hingham Historical Society.
 The Community Preservation Committee [CPC] voted Wednesday night to recommend the town approve $772,000 for the purchase of the house. The funds, which come from a surtax on town real estate, are $200,000 shy of the total purchase price of the house. The Historical Society will need to come up with the rest.
 Director Deirdre Anderson said fundraising the $200,000 is doable for the society. They are already in the process of private fundraising now for the $200,000 plus $1 million in endowment, which will give them cushion for maintenance and operating costs.
 Anderson said they will open the fundraising to the public soon, but the goal is to have 70 percent of the needed funds before they do so. Anderson would not release how much has been raised so far.
 The society has until September to raise the money, as the seller agreed to keep the house off the market until then.
 Anderson said they also have the opportunity to fundraise regionally because the house has a national history appeal, and some outside of Hingham may be interested in preserving it.
 The society originally asked for the full $972,000 price of the house, but CPC chairman Larry Lindner said the committee can't always give the total request.
 "It wasn't that we thought they didn't deserve the money," he said. "It was a budget consideration...How do we best satisfy their needs with our needs."      Anderson said they were more than happy with the $772,000 recommendation.
 The Benjamin Lincoln house on North Street went on the market in April for the first time in nearly 400 years. The home has been in the family of Benjamin Lincoln, Hingham's own revolutionary war hero, since it was first built in 1637.
 The 3,750 square feet, five-bedroom, three-bath home that sits on a half-acre lot on North Street is listed as an antique home on the National Register of Historic Places.      The house is furnished with many of Benjamin Lincoln's own items such as his desk, bed, portraits, cane, trunks and china. Many of the historic furnishings will come with the home when bought by the historical society.
 The Historical society said in November that they plan to turn the home into a history center that will be open to the public and part museum.
 The funds recommended by the CPC will not be released until approved by voters at Town Meeting. The funds are given to projects that relate to recreation, preservation of historic resources, and low income housing. Money in the fund is raised by a 1.5% surtax on Town real estate taxes and state matching grants.
 To fund the purchase the town would have to vote to borrow money. The application is the only project the CPC recommended to bond.
 South Shore Country Club pool
 The South Shore country club is just a Town Meeting vote away from plans for a new pool.
 The CPC recommended $500,000 for funding for a new country club pool Wednesday as well.
 The pool was deemed unsafe in September so it was shut down.
 The $500,000 would cover the design and construction cost of the pool. Management Committee Chairman Christine Smith said they hope to open the new pool in 2022, in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the country club.
 "I am very thankful for the hard work of many community volunteers and our Executive Director Kevin Whalen for defining a feasible project to be enjoyed by our entire community," Smith said.
 Other recommendations
 The CPC also recommended $272,300 for the Hingham Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund, $75,000 for the tennis courts at Plymouth River School, $40,000 for the Centerbury Street Cemetery and $32,000 for the second parish clock tower.
 They did not recommend any funds to the Inner Harbor Master Plan or the Benjamin Lincoln statue.

The center is seeking money to support the falcon, and the dozen or so other animal ambassadors through its annual Wild Pals donation program.
 Started about five years ago, Wild Pals is a yearlong program that encourages the community to invest in the animals at the nonprofit center. The initiative seeks to support the 15 animal ambassadors that range from box turtles to a turkey vulture, said McCall Gorbach Foster, the center’s development specialist.
 “This helps us cover the costs of medical care, food and bedding and to continue to care for and treat the animals in our program,” she said.
 Opened in 1945, the center offers nature-based programs for children in preschool through students in high school. It has a $1.6 million budget and a 32-member staff, who are specialists in such areas as wildlife rehabilitation, astronomy and early childhood programs. Nearly half of the center’s budget comes from donations and grants.
 Most of the injured animals that come through the center’s doors are healed and released. But others become ambassadors when the staff determines that they can’t survive in the wilderness on their own. The ambassadors do not have names because the staff still considers them wild animals, not pets.
 The Wild Pals program is an ongoing way to raise money to ensure the care of the ambassadors and a way to get the community interested in what the center does.
 “Wild Pals is important not only because funds generated help offset the costs of medical care, food and maintenance for our animals, but it also helps children get excited about our mission and encourages them to learn more about our native wildlife,” Foster said.

“Chris and Ligi might be sloppy in the ruck or have one carry and you don’t see them for a while, whereas Brad can clean it up. That’s how the two work together.
 “He’s fit, tidy, energetic, good skill and he’s got a good attitude, for a young kid he’s a bit of a throwback with his attitude. He’s been really good.”
 Another who has caught the eye of Radford is one of his new signings, Ligi Sao.
 The Samoa international has a point to prove after finding first grade rugby hard to come by under Stephen Kearney at New Zealand Warriors and he certainly made an impression on his first outing for FC.
 Sao starred in FC’s win over London Broncos and impressed a week later at Batley and Radford is tipping him for a big year in black and white.

At such a young age, Simpson feared the abuse was her fault. "I was the victim but somehow I felt in the wrong," Simpson added. When she was 12 years old, Simpson finally told her parents, Joe and Tina Simpson, on a car trip. Disturbed by the allegations, her parents cut ties with the family, but didn't discuss the incident with their daughter further.  
 When Simpson was 16, she released her debut album, _Sweet Kisses_, and was on her way to fame--which brought its own set of difficulties. To deal with the stress of a career in the public eye and the trauma of childhood abuse, Simpson turned to alcohol and stimulants.
 Simpson revealed her addiction grew so dire that she told a medical professional she feared for her life. She hit rock bottom in late 2017, during a Halloween party at her home.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Pittsburgh’s Cameron Heyward jogged through the end zone, stretched out his right arm and made a one-handed catch to start Pro Bowl practice Wednesday.
 Not bad for a defensive lineman.
 And no one should be surprised to see Heyward do it again in the NFL’s all- star game Sunday.
 The annual event looked a lot like a backyard pickup game last year, with trick plays and position swaps being more prevalent than deep balls and defensive indifference.
 “It’s definitely more than just a game,” Tennessee defensive tackle Jurrell Casey said. “We work hard all year long, beating each other down, so to come out and switch positions for one or two plays, I don’t think it hurts nobody.
 “A lot of guys, they played a different position back in the day, so let them come out and mess around with that a little bit.”
 Casey already put in his request, asking Baltimore coach John Harbaugh if he can get a goal-line carry.
 “I used to play a little running back,” said the 6-foot-1, 305-pound Casey. “He said he’s going to try, but he doesn’t’ want to mess up the system too much. I’m going to keep on trying to feed him all week. They’ve got to let me touch the ball at least once.”
 It wouldn’t be a shock considering what happened last year in Orlando.
 Jacksonville cornerback Jalen Ramsey caught a touchdown pass in the closing seconds of the AFC’s 26-7 victory. Tampa Bay receiver Mike Evans had a pass breakup and an interception on consecutive defensive snaps.
 Minnesota receiver Adam Thielen threw an interception on a trick play. A trio of running backs — New York’s Saquon Barkley, Dallas’ Ezekiel Elliott and New Orleans’ Alvin Kamara — rushed the passer on third-down plays.
 Elliott also lined up as an up-back in punt formation on a fourth-and-13 play and gained 22, his longest run of the game.
 “It was just spur of the moment,” Elliott said. “It makes it more fun. Fun for the players, fun for the fans. It’s nice to be a little different.”
 It might just be the evolution — some might call it devolution — of the exhibition game that’s become less and less intense over the years. There’s little, if any, tackling and barely any contact along the lines of scrimmage. It often looks more like a walk-through than a workout — two-hand touch at the most.
 “It’s supposed to be about fun,” Atlanta tight end Austin Hooper said. “That’s the whole reason the NFL says do this – for it to be fun. So why not switch up positions a little bit, give the fans something to be excited about and shake things up?
 “At the end of the day, this is all a celebration. If you’re Mike (Evans), who played DB in high school, and you want to play a little bit in the NFL all- star game, go for it. If you’re Jalen Ramsey and you played receiver in high school and you want to play a little in the all-star game, have at it.
 “There are a lot of cool, fun wrinkles in this game and that’s what makes it special.”
 Not everyone is down to clown around, especially since players on the winning team get double the payout — $70,000 instead of $35,000.
 “Everybody has dreams of playing another position," Jacksonville defensive end Calais Campbell said. “When you have those dreams, you have to really pull on the coach’s shoulder. But when the game’s on the line, though, we want to win. No playing around if you can’t deliver.”
 Denver linebacker Von Miller, though, enjoyed the frolicking last year and hopes for a bigger role Sunday.
 “This might be my year," Miller said. "You never know. I’m right here, I’m ready to go whenever they need me. Fans come out here to see their favorite players play football, and seeing them in a different light, that’s great.”

“Sometimes, it’s important to talk to a teacher or an adult to let them know what’s going on,” Sarah said. “They have more authority and may be able to help the situation quicker.”
 Landen Kunzelman, also a sixth grader, agreed with Sarah. “An adult or a teacher probably can stop the situation faster,” he said.
 The pledge cards also are a good tool for the school principals.
 If a student acts out or causes a problem, the principal can ask if they've signed a pledge card. If they have, the principal reminds them how they are supposed to behave. If they haven't signed a card, the principal may suggest they do so, Walsh said.
 "Kids are pretty friendly at Troy, and we want to keep them on that path," Walsh said. "The most important thing is that It has helped contribute to the climate of the building."

FAIRMONT — Only three months after the long-lost Purple Heart of Farmington native Pvt. Richard Earl Gregor was donated to the Marion County Historical Museum, the medal has been reunited with Gregor’s family.
 When the medal was found last year by a good Samaritan, it was given to Purple Hearts United, a nonprofit organization that focuses on reuniting medals with the veterans’ families or hometowns, which then donated the medal to the museum in October 2019 when nobody could find Gregor’s next-of-kin.
 However, when news got around that Gregor’s medal had been donated to the museum, Colfax resident Robert Gregor — Richard’s half brother — reached out to explain that there was, indeed, some family of Richard’s left in the area.

Furthermore, focusing on 5G could undermine the ultimate goal of connecting rural areas if the technology and implementation are not up to the specific challenges in these geographies.

In 2018, we took the first baby steps into the 21st century by eliminating our landline. But we didn’t really eliminate it. The bundle we got from U-Verse required us to have a landline. So it was there, but we literally never used it. Never plugged in a phone. Never memorized the number. It proved to be heaven-sent in regards to unwanted telephone solicitations and, Lord help us, political calls.
 Finally, in December, we decided enough was enough. The nearly $200 a month for AT&T got to be too much. And frankly, when we called with issues, they were always borderline rude or, worse, condescending.
 The next decision was even harder. Which streaming service? (Hulu Plus, Sling TV, YouTube TV, and AT&T Watch TV, to name a few.) In place of a cable box and the monthly fee to rent it, you use an app on your smart TV, Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV or game console. Sound scary and complicated? I thought so. So we began with baby steps. First we bought a Roku. I hooked it up to a TV at work to watch CNN. I logged in with my AT&T account. It got me familiar with Roku.
 To pick a streaming service, we asked everyone we knew who had cut the cord. We never considered Sling, although some recommended it. Honestly, those commercials are so creepy, we just couldn’t. It the end it was between YouTube TV and Hulu Plus. We ended up going with Hulu based on my brother-in-law’s rave review.
 Now we pay $60 a month for Hulu; the Roku was a one-time cost of $30 (there are levels of Roku you can buy). We also still get the apps Netflix, Disney+ (free through our Verizon phone), and BritBox. I can’t get enough of British mysteries and other shows. We may end up getting Hallmark channels through the app Frndly TV, but I’m still thinking about it.

No Brasil, há apenas o controle da inflação e, para alcançar a meta, em 4% para 2020, o Banco Central usa como principal instrumento a taxa básica de juros, a Selic, atualmente definida em 4,5% ao ano pelo Comitê de Política Monetária (Copom). Quando o Copom reduz a Selic, a tendência é que o crédito fique mais barato, com incentivo à produção e ao consumo, reduzindo o controle da inflação e estimulando a atividade econômica. Quando o Copom aumenta a taxa básica de juros, o objetivo é conter a demanda aquecida e isso causa reflexos nos preços porque os juros mais altos encarecem o crédito e estimulam a poupança.

TOPEKA -- The Kansas Highway Patrol requested the Kansas Legislature allocate $11 million for two new helicopters and $4.8 million for a new airplane to replace aging equipment and meet rising demand for assistance from law enforcement agencies statewide.
 The pitch to a House budget committee Tuesday indicated KHP was proposing purchase of a pair of Airbus H125 helicopters for $5.5 million each and to acquire a Cessna C208 Caravan EX for $4.8 million.
 In addition, the agency proposed devoting $650,000 to upgrade the FLIR observation camera on an existing 2012 Cessna 206. Changes to KHP's fleet will necessitate an increase of $1.3 million annually in operational funding, KHP officials said.
 "We're the sole provider of airborne law enforcement in the state. So, when the call comes in, we are it. In the past it was traffic enforcement. Those days are few and far between. We're always getting called to the manhunt, the car chase, the surveillance," said KHP Capt. Jason Vanderweide, who commands the aviation operations for KHP.
 "It's not just a Highway Patrol issue," he said. "We're assisting over 100 different agencies every year. We are their call. When serious incidents happen, we're one of the first calls. They rely on us."
 Vanderweide said new helicopters would be stationed in Topeka and Wichita to cover the central and eastern portions of the state. The new Caravan aircraft would be based in Hays to serve the western one-third of Kansas, he said. In addition, 2012 single-wing airplanes would be located at Topeka and Wichita.
 To mitigate the overall cost of the aviation transition, KHP said it would trade in a helicopter and two airplanes valued at about $2 million. The overall package, including operating expenditures, would be $16.4 million.
 "This is a big expenditure for this committee. It's new spending," said Rep. Shannon Francis, a Republican from Liberal who chairs the House Transportation and Public Safety Budget Committee.
 Vanderweide said the strategy was to keep the pair of 2012 aircraft for several years, while trading away a 2005 helicopter and airplanes manufactured in 1998 and 1978.
 He said the camera in one of the KHP aircraft failed three times while helping to track a shooting suspect in Ellis County in 2019.
 "We've got the suspect in sight," Vanderweide said. "He's outside still shooting. Units can't get close, and our clear camera fails three times. We have to restart it. We acquire the suspect again. It fails again, very frustrating for the crew."

Henare O’Keefe, a long-time community worker in Flaxmere, a township near Taradale, said that in the short term “the full brunt of the law” should be brought to bear on those responsible, while in the long term, examining children’s home environments would be crucial to solving the problem.                  “People are fearful. They’re angry. They’ve had enough.

_Dear editor,_
 I have read that some business owners have voiced concerns about the fact that Candlelight Tradition did not bring the masses to the downtown Frankfort area ("DFI hears from merchants about changes in Candlelight planning," Jan. 14).
 Advertising, word of mouth and sponsorships aside, could a factor be that families are tired of businesses pushing liquor sales down our throats instead of the family values we once had in the yesteryears of the older Candlelights? Could it be that families are tired of being pushed aside and told we are not important? Tired of not being heard. Tired of our voice being tossed aside.
 We were involved for years and it seems no one wants any input unless it involves bourbon or non-Christian event planning. We have numerous award- winning artists willing to participate, but no one wants to have these artists due to their values.

"I am going to try Kylie's trick of brown mascara on the bottom," says Kardashian West in the video above. "What an interesting trick. I don't think I will like it." It's worth noting that Kylie Cosmetics does not currently make a mascara, though it's probably in the works. In the video, Jenner hands her sister a tube of Dior's Diorshow Iconic Overcurl Mascara in brown. KKW Beauty just brought back its sold-out $18 mascara formula, but it only comes in black.
 "You use the curled part, it shapes to your situation," Jenner tells Kardashian West, noting the Dior mascara's unique curled wand. The shape of the wand perfectly fits along the bottom lashline, and the brown shade is decidedly less harsh and severe than a traditional black. If you're constantly battling runny mascara on your bottom lashes, try Jenner's trick and switch to a lighter and softer brown.
 "My dad used to always walk by me and he would be like, 'Kimberly, can you close your mouth when you put mascara on?'" Kardashian West recalls in the tutorial. "He would say, 'I bet you there are two things you can't do in life. Close your mouth when you are putting on mascara, and walk by a mirror without looking in it.'"

Originally, it was Joe DiMaggio for whom Paul Simon wrote those lyrics as part of his anthem, “Mrs. Robinson” from the 1967 movie “The Graduate” — the point being those were troubled times in America back then and the country was longing for a hero like the Yankee Clipper to help restore its faith. These are likewise troubled times for baseball, which is why Jeter, the closest thing we have had to DiMaggio as the perfect ballplayer, who did everything the right way on and off the field, is back in our midst at the most opportune time.

Des Moines County will be getting a new program for individuals with mental illnesses who do not need to be hospitalized, but need a more supportive living situation.
 The idea was discussed during the Des Moines County Supervisors meeting Tuesday in Burlington.
 The Cottonwood Facility, at 910 Cottonwood Ct. which is operated by Hope Haven, helps those with severe mental illnesses, but under a new plan, the facility also would assist those who have a dual diagnosis of both mental illness issues and substance abuse disorders.
 "I believe the individual who was involved in the fire would have benefited from this service," said Bob Bartels, executive director of Hope Haven Development Center, about Michael Kartel, who was killed Jan. 13 in a house fire he started after an hours-long standoff with police.
 According to Kartel's family, he suffered from severe mental illness as well as an addiction to alcohol.
 The Cottonwood Facility has space for 15 individuals with mental illness and intellectual disabilities, the maximum number allowed by federal law. Bartels estimated about half of the individuals are mentally ill and the other half are intellectually disabled.
 Individuals living in Cottonwood have their own bedroom and bathroom. They also spend time with other residents and go about normal living in a setting that is more supportive than living alone, but less restrictive than a mental health institution.
 "For most of them, it is their home," Bartels said.
 The plan is to move the individuals into one of three four-bedroom houses. Bartels said this better aligns with the vision of community treatment for those with severe mental illness. The facility had already been refusing to fill empty beds in anticipation of moving individuals into new living spaces.
 According to Bartels, there is one individual who said they want to remain in a larger facility. Hope Haven is working with this person to find them another place to live. Though, if the individual were to change their mind, they would be able to live in one of the three four-bedroom houses.
 The Cottonwood facility's mental health and substance abuse program, often called a dual diagnosis program, would serve to fill the gap left by the closure of the Mental Health Institute in Mount Pleasant.
 The program would aim at keeping residents off drugs while also treating their mental illness. A focus of the program will be getting these individuals back to work and helping them succeed.
 "This is not supposed to be their home," Bartels said.
 Bartles said judges will be able to sentence defendants who have dual diagnosis to the facility, like they did with MHI, but the Cottonwood Facility would remain an unlocked facility.
 If an individual who was sentenced to the program were to walk away from the facility, law enforcement would be notified.
 Bartels is working with the state to figure out how funding would work, but said he would ask the state to provide consistent funding for individuals in the house for at least six to twelve months.
 Reimbursement rates for those living in residential care facilities is based upon the level of care needed and, with treatment, those with mental illness often need less care after being at the house than when they first arrived.
 Drug abuse related services for those living in the house would be provided by Alcohol and Drug Dependency Services of Southeast Iowa. Mental health services will be provided by Hope Haven and Young House Family Services.
 Bartels said he expects the moving of the current residents to be done in the spring and that the facility will fill up with individuals with dual diagnosis some time after that.

Bernie Sanders’ campaign recently stabbed Elizabeth Warren in the back. She was the Vermont senator’s comrade in arms. It also threw a pack of lies at Joe Biden, tarring him as corrupt with zero evidence. As former Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin told Politico, Sanders “will play dirty.” The Democrat added, “I’m concerned that we’re seeing a replay of the kind of dynamics that didn’t allow Hillary to win.”
 The difference between now and 2016, though, is that Sanders’ targets are finally hitting back. This outbreak of hostilities among Democrats is not hurting the party. On the contrary. An airing of these grievances is long overdue.
 And whether one shares Sanders’ political views is irrelevant to this conversation. (I like some of them.)
 The danger Sanders poses for the party is that, to him, electing Democrats comes second to building the “movement.” This explains why his sidekick, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is pushing primary challenges to moderate Democrats who won difficult races in swing districts.
 The catchphrase on Sanders’ website, Our Revolution, is “Campaigns end. Revolutions Endure.” Indeed, he and his fellow socialists have latched on to the Democratic Party because having a D after their names is the only way they can win an election.
 Few things make the Bernie base madder than the charge that their hero helped sabotage Clinton’s candidacy. Its members passionately note that he politicked for her in the last days of the campaign. That’s true, but by then, not doing so was tantamount to openly supporting Donald Trump.
 Early in 2016, when it seemed possible that Sanders might score more votes than Clinton, he assailed the superdelegates who mostly backed Clinton and could have delivered her victory. His supporters demanded that superdelegates reflect the popular vote, “not the party elites.”
 By June, when Clinton had racked up a commanding majority of primary votes, Sanders did an about face and urged the superdelegates to ignore the voters and support him. “Superdelegates have a very important decision to make,” he told NBC News.
 Upon winning the Republican nomination, Trump announced, “To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of superdelegates, we welcome you with open arms.”
 Trump was the official Republican candidate, and Sanders still wouldn’t back the Democratic one. In the weeks leading up to the Democratic National Convention, he withheld his endorsement of Clinton, insisting that certain demands be met. Some of his delegates chanted, “Lock her up!” right on the convention floor.
 Sanders (and Trump’s Russian trolls) had brainwashed some liberals and independents into believing that Clinton was horribly corrupt. That helps explain why 20 percent of those who voted for Sanders in the primaries did not vote for Clinton in the general election. Some of his supporters are now spreading the fear that history could repeat itself if a moderate such as Biden becomes the nominee.
 Elaine Godfrey wrote in The Atlantic that progressive organizers she has spoken with said they are “worried that, absent a Democratic candidate who excites them, many Americans might not vote at all.”
 Trump should excite them enough. People who don’t get that they are voting _against_ as well as _for_ are political neuters. Are they going to help re- elect Trump on Tuesday and then rage on Wednesday that he’s burning up the planet?
 Yes, mainstream Democrats had to have it out with the heretic hunters of the left. The person most displeased by this counterattack on Sanders surely must be Trump. Sanders is the candidate Trump most wants to run against. And that should tell Democrats something.

 Illinois began allowing recreational cannabis sales on New Year's Day, and the experience has been enough to induce the sort of giddiness users have been known to exhibit.
 Long lines confirmed a lot of pent-up demand for legal weed, and sales the first week amounted to $12.9 million -- higher than (um, in excess of, we mean) the first week's revenue in any other state. \"It is a really strong indication that the market is going to be very, very healthy here,\" Bethany Gomez of cannabis research firm Brightfield Group told the Tribune's Ally Marotti. In the first 12 days, the total was $19.7 million.
 The downside is many dispensaries soon ran out of recreational supplies. Some have had to turn away customers or limit purchases.
 The sales surge is reassuring in a way. It suggests lots of people were eager to get their pot from regulated sellers, despite the higher prices, rather than from the illicit dealers who previously had the market to themselves. All those purchases yield a harvest of sales tax revenue. They also should prevent the harms to health caused by adulterated products from black-market dealers.
 Hopeful indicators are no reason to get carried away, however. Illinois is conducting a large social experiment, and it will take time to find out exactly how positively or negatively it will play out. A few weeks into the legal weed era is way too early to relax the rules.
 That's why we're relieved Mayor Lori Lightfoot has decided not to push forward with a proposed ordinance to allow on-site consumption. In her plan, in accordance with limits in the state law, tobacco shops, hookah lounges and other such shops could let patrons smoke pot. They would have to provide appropriate ventilation in standalone buildings; they'd have to pay $4,400 for a license every two years and most of downtown Chicago would be off-limits.
 The alleged problem on-site consumption would address is the shortage of places where people can smoke cannabis. Toking isn't allowed in public places, including parks, schools, government buildings, buses, trains and anywhere minors are present. Landlords are allowed to ban it as well. Smoking of any kind is illegal in restaurants, bars, stores, theaters and most hotel rooms. The only place you can be sure of getting to blaze a blunt in peace is in a home you own.
 The city has plenty to worry about right now without taking on that issue. Only two states, Alaska and Colorado, have elected to permit pot consumption sites, both recently. Illinois could benefit greatly from waiting to see their results there before deciding whether to follow suit by authorizing more establishments to allow pot smoking.
 These states may find that such venues produce headaches for neighbors, as rowdy bars do. It may be that most users are content to partake in their rec rooms or on their patios. On the other hand, it may turn out lots of people will pay to smoke weed in places designed for communal enjoyment. We just don't know.
 Learning from the experience of other states can save us from mistakes. Illinois, including Chicago, is just getting the chance to learn for itself what legal pot means. With time, we'll find if adjustments to the rules are needed. For now, the best policy is patience.

To say this basketball season has been a special one for Frankfort High School coach Chris O’Bryan and his family would be an understatement. In a span of less than two months, the second-year coach has witnessed his wife, Jacqueline Coleman, sworn in as the 58th lieutenant governor, paced the sideline wearing a tuxedo in her honor and steered his team to the 11th Region All “A” tournament crown — its first in 17 years.
 But the best part is that he has gotten to do it all with his two sons, Will and Nate O’Bryan — who are players on the team — along for the ride.
 On Saturday, the Panthers knocked off host Lexington Christian 41-39 — a payback for last season when LCA defeated FHS on its home floor — to advance to its first state All “A” Classic since 2003. In the championship game, Will, a senior, had four rebounds and drilled three 3-pointers and Nate, a junior who comes off the bench, had three boards and a bucket.
 Thanks to O’Bryan, Frankfort's hoops team functions like a family. They spread the ball around, trust one another and aren’t easily intimidated — all traits they will need when they take on a 15-2 Bishop Brossart team in the opening round of the state All “A” Classic Thursday at Eastern Kentucky University.
 The Panthers won’t be making the trip alone. The FHS student body will be heading to Richmond to cheer them on and are asking parents and alumni to join them to create a sea of orange and blue. If Frankfort is victorious Thursday, it will play the winner of the Owensboro Catholic-West Carter game on Friday evening.
 We wish FHS well, but win or lose there are more games to be played this season and we have inkling that these Panthers aren’t done yet.
 Neither are the O’Bryans. The family will welcome its newest little dribbler — a baby girl — next month.

TRENTON (AP) -- New Jersey has become the first state to guarantee severance pay for mass layoffs, according to the bill's sponsors and the governor's office.                           Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed legislation Tuesday that requires companies with 100 or more full-time employees to pay them a week's pay for each year of service during a mass layoff, plant closing or transfer resulting in 50 or more workers losing their jobs. The law also increases the minimum number of days notice from 60 to 90 for such events.                           The legislation was motivated by last year's closing of Toys R Us, which cost 2,000 employees their jobs in New Jersey. Two of the private equity firms that owned the retail giant eventually established a severance fund.                           "When these corporate takeover artists plunge the companies into bankruptcy, they walk away with windfall profits and pay top executives huge bonuses, but the little guys get screwed," said state Sen. Joe Cryan, a Democrat who was a co-sponsor.                           Cryan said he hopes companies will think twice about whether layoffs should be "their go-to solution for every problem."                           The new law has its critics. The New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which lobbies state government on behalf of businesses, said the law will take effect just as other requirements like a higher minimum wage and increased taxes are hitting.                           The association said in a statement that the legislation makes New Jersey less competitive.                           New Jersey is phasing in a $15 hourly minimum wage, which this year climbed to $11 from $10. It will go up a $1 a year until it hits $15 in 2024. Beginning in 2018, businesses earning more than $1 million also had their taxes hiked over four years by an average of 2% as a result of negotiations between Murphy and lawmakers over the budget.                           John Schmidt Jr., a labor attorney based in New Jersey, shared the business association's views. He said he hears from clients that they're considering leaving the state because of the mandates. Schmidt, who said he has practiced law for 40 years, added that he had seen too many cases that would fall into the category the law aims to address.                           "They've used a sledgehammer to kill a fly," he said.                           The legislation passed along party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. The law goes into effect in July.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

 According to our source, the fact that Jesse was photographed with two women didn't help the situation. It's something that Cara was "completely blindsided" by.
 "She knew they were having issues but didn't think he would betray her on this level and its truly embarrassing for her," the source explained.

"You were talking in your sleep last night," I said to my husband when he stumbled into the kitchen that morning. I handed him a cup of Espresso to jolt him out of his coma.      "No, I wasn't," he said.      "How would you know," I said. "You were asleep. I was not asleep … because you were talking in your sleep."      "I don't talk in my sleep," he said as he sat down at the table. The dog came over for a scratch behind the ears or maybe just to take my husband's side.      "Well, you did last night," I said. "And you were very adamant about it."      Now my husband was interested. I'm sure he thought he had perhaps divulged some husband secret from deep within his subconscious, like, the fact that he purposely hangs the toilet paper the wrong way just to make me crazy.      "What did I say?" he wondered.      "Begone," I replied.      "I said 'begone?'" he repeated.      "Yes."      He shook his head. "I would never say 'begone.' I'd say 'Get lost,' but I wouldn't say 'begone.' I think you heard it wrong. Maybe I said, 'poupon.'"      "Were you dreaming about mustard?" I said.      "Unlikely," he admitted. We were both silent as we wondered what had inspired him to yell out "begone" in his sleep. Maybe he had dreamed he was a king's attendant in a Shakespeare play, or a French knight in a Monty Python movie. Perhaps he was a hobbit standing his ground in the Shire, or a constable clearing the cobblestone streets of Old England from lollygaggers. Or maybe he dreamed it was 200 years ago and I was berating him for hanging the toilet paper the wrong way and he yelled at me to "begone."      This wasn't the first time he had talked in his sleep. There was the time he did a musical countdown and conducted an orchestra while he slept, smacking me in the face as he directed the string section. Another time he yelled out, 'Who's there!" and I jumped out of bed and hid in the closet thinking there was an intruder in the house. And one time he told me to bring the camels inside, even though we lived in the suburbs and we weren't zoned for domesticated desert pets.      Sleeping with my husband was not restful, but it was certainly entertaining.      "Did I say anything else," he asked, hoping for some insight into the source of his nocturnal mumblings.      I thought for a moment. He had said some other things but mostly under his breath so I couldn't make them out.      "I don't know," I finally said. "Maybe I dreamed it."      "Probably," he said. "'Cuz I would never say 'begone.'"   "Okay. Anyway, honey, I have to run," I said, putting on my jacket. "I have an appointment. Would you mind taking the dog out?" I thrust the leash at him.      "Fine," he said. "Begone."   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.

The outreach program helps provide the students’ peers with basic needs and promotes a safe, comfortable learning environment. Slabodnick's students chose to follow the mission of Rachel's Closet after reviewing about a half-dozen programs last year. The Colorado-based program is named after Rachel Joy Scott. She was the first student killed during the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, on April 20, 1999. Although the students and community have been donating items since October, Slabodnick and her students plan to officially kick off their Rachel's Closet this month and accept donations.
 Rachel's Closet began soon after Rachel Scott’s parents read their 17-year-old daughter's journals. The journals revealed that the high school senior wanted to start a chain reaction of her beliefs, which she wrote about in an essay titled "My Ethics, My Codes of Life" a month before her death.
 Now, the North Ridgeville students are part of Rachel’s Challenge, and about 25 students belong to Friends of Rachel. The club’s aim is to advocate for Rachel’s values, based on her life, her journals and her belief that compassion is "the greatest form of love humans have to offer."
 "We are excited about Rachel's Closet here at the school," said Slabodnick, who has taught in the district since 2011. "We have been working hard to get it up and running and have a lot of great donations from the community. We have come to realize that we have students here with basic needs. The word is getting out about what we're doing here. People aren't afraid to ask for help."
 Donations are accepted during the school year, and the school plans to put a Google form online or provide a link to its website where students can discreetly request an item they need. High school students also are becoming involved with the intermediate school students and are planning to build a shed to store items, Slabodnick said.
 Seventh-grader Maggie Ellis and eighth-grader Zareen Sulaiman are among the students who recently joined the club.
 "I wanted to help people," Zareen said. "I like to help people feel good, and I like helping people who are in need."

"Everyone sees those big, brightly-coloured, heavily-textured slugs out and about in the daytime so they assume that all slugs look like that," she said.                   "But, actually, if you go out at night in your garden and take a look you might be surprised to see all sorts of different colours and sizes and types of slug around."                  ## New recruits                  The researchers will train up to 60 people to hunt for slugs by going out at night with a torch once a month for 30 minutes.                  Potential volunteers don't need any specialist knowledge, only access to a garden and an interest in learning more about the shell-less gastropods. The specimens will be posted to the RHS for analysis, as the species are difficult to identify from photographs.                   "This information is going to be really important in informing us as to which slugs are most common in gardens and what time of year they're most abundant," said Imogen Cavadino.                   "With what we know about slug feeding behaviour we can then use this to understand better which species are likely to be causing problems in gardens and what time of year they're most likely to be around doing the damage to plants."                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Lorenzo Insigne on Tuesday shot SSC Napoli into the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia with the only goal in an eventful 1-0 win over in-form SS Lazio.
 Italy international Insigne needed just 99 seconds to score the winning goal in a match that saw both teams have a player sent off and Ciro Immobile miss a penalty in the first 25 minutes.
 The win for Napoli, which came after three straight defeats in Serie A, means they will face either league title-chasers Inter or ACF Fiorentina, who face off on Wednesday next week at the San Siro in Milan, Italy.
 Holders Lazio did everything but score on a night when both teams hit the woodwork several times, with Immobile having a rare off night in a season that has seen him score 26 goals in all competitions.
 Insigne displayed some of the sparkling form that he has been lacking this season when he opened the scoring, weaving past Luiz Felipe before slotting a neat finish into the goal.
 Visitors Lazio quickly shook off the cobwebs and had a Sergej Milinkovic-Savic shot pushed away before Elseid Hysaj kicked Felipe Caicedo in the box as the Ecuadorian dived for a 10th-minute header.
 However, Immobile let Napoli off the hook by slipping as he was about to kick the resulting penalty, which finished in the running track behind the goal.
 Things looked to be turning toward Lazio when Hysaj, already booked for his challenge on Caicedo, clattered into Immobile as the striker raced away and picked up a deserved second booking with less than 20 minutes gone.
 However, with Napoli facing more than 70 minutes a man down, referee Davide Massa soon leveled the playing field by inexplicably booking Lucas Leiva for a fine tackle on Piotr Zielinski, before quickly flashing another yellow card at the livid Brazilian for dissent.

“It was wonderful to hear about this,” Robert Gregor said. “He was older than I was. He’d come over to see his dad once in a while, but he did that before he went into the service. … It’s nice to have this (Purple Heart) to pass along through the family.”
 Robert was invited to the museum Friday afternoon, where his brother’s Purple Heart was officially given back to the Gregor family. Joni Morris, the executive director of the Marion County Historical Museum, said it was amazing to be able to reunite the medal with the Gregor family.
 “It was awesome for us to be able to send one of our Purple Hearts home to the family,” Morris said. “It was nice to be able to meet his brother and learn how they were connected… For us to be able to give back to a local family is a really great feeling.”
 Richard Gregor, son of Stephen and Ceatta B. Billingslea Gregor, enlisted in the U.S. Army and was shipped with Company C, 184th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division to fight on Okinawa when he was just 18 years old.
 He was killed in action on May 1, 1945, just months after marrying Alice Crenshaw.
 To date, Purple Hearts Reunited has returned more than 650 medals to family or local museums across the United States. Capt. Jessica Jaggars, director of operations for Purple Hearts United, said getting the medals back in the hands of loved ones or those hoping to preserve history is crucial.
 “Those medals stand for more than just a medal,” Jaggars said. “They stand for service and sacrifice. A lot of those in service who receive these have often given the ultimate sacrifice: Their life.”
