On top of that, despite Turkey’s genuine invitations for talks on the recent tension with Greece over the island of Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean, stuffily Pompeo skipped coming to Turkey and instead visited both Greek Cyprus and Greece. Consequently, Pompeo’s controversial visit was perceived by all segments in Turkey as a highly provocative step bypassing Ankara and maintaining the patriarchate in Istanbul as the addressee.

COVID-19 has infected more than 52 million people worldwide, with over 1.2 million deaths. More than 300,000 people have died of COVID-19 across Europe, and authorities fear that fatalities and infections will continue to rise as the region heads into winter despite hopes for a new vaccine. With just 10% of the world’s population, Europe accounts for almost a quarter of the global deaths, with its well-equipped hospitals even feeling the strain.

In other parts of the world, the U.S. remains the hardest-hit nation with more than 240,000 deaths. Shocking new data shows a record of 60,000 hospitalizations.

The number of COVID-19 patients sent to French hospitals is showing signs of stabilizing this week, with some doctors predicting that hospitalizations are nearing a peak and soon will start to subside. But intensive care units in France are already over-saturated and new arrivals are still outpacing departures. COVID-19 patients fill more than 93% of France’s intensive care unit (ICU) beds, in addition to non-virus patients also receiving intensive care treatment.

Around the country, officials scrambled to staunch the spread. In New York state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that any establishment with a liquor license, including bars and restaurants, would have to close at 10 p.m. beginning Friday and the rule will also apply to gyms. New York City was the early epicenter of the nation&#39;s COVID-19 pandemic, but hot spots have since cropped up across the country, leaving practically no geographical region unaffected. One such location is the border city of El Paso in western Texas, a state where COVID-19 cases have now exceeded 1 million. More than 1,000 people have been hospitalized in the county of El Paso alone, a substantial portion of the state&#39;s nearly 6,800 hospitalizations.

However, political figures in Washington, especially during the election period, increasingly meddled in Turkey&#39;s internal affairs, national security priorities and showed an attitude that ignores the interests and legitimate concerns of Ankara. In fact, this situation inevitably left wreckage that was inherited from the Obama era.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan sent a congratulatory message to President- elect Joe Biden on Tuesday, who is believed to have won the office according to current election results, although it has not been officially announced. On the same day, Erdoğan also thanked incumbent President Donald Trump for his sincere contribution to Turkish-American relations on the basis of common interests throughout the last four years. Ankara sent these messages as an indicator of courtesy, though the presidential candidates do not talk to each other.

The 6-month-old was among 111 survivors taken in by the Proactiva Open Arms rescue ship on Wednesday after it sent rescue units to a rubber dinghy whose hull had exploded off the Libyan coast. In the operation, five bodies were recovered. The death of the infant, said to have been named Joseph and to have come from Guinea, brought the total death toll from the shipwreck to six.

Despite all the constructive steps taken by Ankara, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s prospective visit to Turkey – who is perhaps spending his last days in the position – justifies these controversies. The statement issued by the U.S. State Department on Tuesday said that in the framework of the visit, Pompeo will visit Istanbul&#39;s Fener Greek Orthodox Patriarch on the pretext of Washington’s support of religious freedom. As expected, Ankara strongly opposed the purpose of this trip.

The dead baby, his mother and a pregnant woman were evacuated by the Italian coast guard and taken to Lampedusa island, an Open Arms spokesperson said.

Moreover, Biden’s apologies to Turkey still retain their place in the country&#39;s memory. Yet, Turkey has maintained its common sense against the U.S. president-elect&#39;s unfounded allegations that claimed once that “Turkey is more dangerous than Iran” and that “Turkey trades oil with Daesh.”

So far this year, more than 575 people have perished in the Central Mediterranean trying to reach Europe, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). For months, small boats carrying migrants have been departing from Libya and Tunisia, usually trying to reach Italy.

Ankara retaliated against Washington with a harsh response, saying it would be better for the U.S. to look in the mirror first and show sensitivity to human rights violations such as racism, Islamophobia and hate crimes in its own country. In the statement, it was also suggested that the reactions were conveyed to U.S. authorities in person and that the U.S. should focus primarily on increasing cooperation between two countries on regional and global issues.

Nowadays, Ankara&#39;s constructive but highly determined stance on conflicts from the Caucasus to the Middle East, from Africa to the Mediterranean is getting stronger day by day. In all these areas, Turkey&#39;s multilateralist and common-interest approach needs to be paid closer attention to by Washington as Turkey is also a NATO ally – which should be remembered. Otherwise, whether Trump or Biden sits in the Oval Office, the president will continue to face these realities in more strained conditions. Yet, if Pompeo keeps his seat, this latest incivility will still be remembered.",

MSF coordinator Olivia Gayraud said Wednesday on France-Info radio that the nursing home recruitment is focused on relieving over-stretched staff and isolated residents, noting that the group has “expertise in crisis management” and experience helping “populations whose lives and health are threatened.” Nursing homes are allowed to stay open under France’s current partial lockdown unlike in the previous lockdown in the spring. Some facilities are again barring visitors and keeping residents in their rooms to protect the elderly as the virus claims more lives.
