"I guess because it hit home, it's not political anymore. It's a plain, simple right and wrong," said McGarity, who already cast a ballot for Biden.

NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart is laying off the robots it had deployed in about 500 stores to keep tabs on what’s on and not on the shelves.The retailer said Monday it has ended its relationship with startup Bossa Nova Robotics, which builds roving robots equipped with cameras for identifying out-of-stock and misplaced products.Walmart said in a statement it has “worked with Bossa Nova for five years and together we learned a lot about how technology can assist associates, make jobs easier and provide a better customer experience.” It said it is still testing other new technologies for tracking inventory and moving goods.The Wall Street Journal was first to report the ending partnership Monday, citing unnamed people familiar with the situation who said the retailer found human workers could get similar results. There was also some concern about how shoppers reacted to robots doing the work, according to the report.Bossa Nova, which was founded in 2005 in Pittsburgh didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Monday.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

But lament not for there is hope still and it is a Linux-based hope. If you haven’t heard of it then you’re not alone. Linux Lite is a lightweight OS made for older or very low specced systems. It is so lightweight that you just need a 1.5GHz processor with 1GB of RAM and 20GB of storage. That’s it and you will have your old laptop up and running like it is new. One of the things that made Linux Lite seem like a viable replacement for Windows is the fact that there is a smooth transition between the UI of Linux Lite and of Windows.

La Acordada N° 7/2018 define la validez de un traslado de magistrados nacionales ordinarios de la Capital Federal a tribunales federales con asiento en esa ciudad, pero no se pronuncia sobre la temporalidad de las designaciones. No dice allí que son definitivos. "La temporalidad que se le asignó a esos traslados entre cargos con competencias diferentes no significa que los traslados entre cargos de similar competencia no fueran también transitorios", dijo ahora la mayoría de la Corte.
