I have noticed that the world over, political parties and governments pay peculiar attention to swing regions mostly in order to win elections. In my opinion, we the people of the Volta Region must become a swing region so all the political parties can take special notice of us, research into what they can do for us to woo us to their side and work assiduously to fulfilling their promises before the next election comes around. That is the only way we can become relevant and develop from this quagmire of hopelessness and despondency we find ourselves in.

For a proper representation that rewards result and not a litany or epistle of efforts, then there is no gain saying that John Peter Amewu leads the way to Parliament for the Hohoe Constituency.

With over 28 years of representation of the good people of Hohoe constituency by the NDC in Parliament, the achievements of the NDC cannot be compared to the galloping, gargantuan and gigantic developmental projects that were executed by Hon. John Peter Amewu in less than four years of serving as a minister under the Nana Addo led NPP administration. For once, this warm gesture must be rewarded with massive votes for a J.P Amewu representation in Parliament, at the very least.
