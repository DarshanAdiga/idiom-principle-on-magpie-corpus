BILLINGS, Mont. — The Crow Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana has extended its stay-at-home order to curtail the spread of COVID-19 and has received more than $25 million in coronavirus relief aid.
 The tribe’s stay-at-home order was extended to June 15, the Billings Gazette reported.
 Tribe Executive Branch Chairman Alvin “A.J.” Not Afraid first issued the order March 28, which included checkpoints for people entering the reservation. It was scheduled to expire Thursday.
 Travelers were encouraged not to travel to the reservation, and those who went out-of-state were asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, tribal leaders said.
 Montana started to reopen in phases in April, allowing retailers and other businesses to open. Gyms, museums and movie theaters were able to resume operations Friday.
 Despite reopening phases, “it is essential, to the maximum extent possible, individuals stay at home or at their place of residence for all residents and tribal members of the Crow Indian Reservation,” Not Afraid said in the order.
 The Crow Tribe has also received more than $25 million in funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act on Wednesday to fund personal protective equipment, testing kits, tribal government response efforts and infection prevention and mitigation plans.
 “This is a huge accomplishment for the United States Government to provide such an unprecedented amount of aid, in such an immediate amount of time,” Not Afraid said. “Our Nation thanks you for providing us a chance to further allocate funding for proper supplies, to help meet our needs and further prepare our Nation, during the health pandemic we are facing.”
 According to a Facebook post, the tribe currently has two positive cases of COVID-19 within the reservation as of April 30.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.

The pandemic has blurred the line between the quotidian and the sublime. Though part of the landscape, two broken lives and a ramshackle vehicle had been stubbornly ignored by habitues of Kutchery Road and Santhome High Road. It were as if they were invisible. And then, with the COVID-19 crisis stalking the streets, and the quotidian taking centre stage, these three could be ignored no longer.
 Besides the current crisis, it took a “peripatetic volunteer” to unearth the three — a former mahout who had evidently seen better days, a visually- challenged woman and a forgotten tricycle — in a neat package of neglect and misfortune.
 It all began end-of-March when this volunteer Baskar Seshadri decided to distribute tea and biscuits to conservancy workers and contract workers with the Corporation; police personnel standing at their post; and even migrant workers staying at a makeshift shelter, in the Mylapore, Mandaveli and Santhome areas.

“The clear scientific and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen accompanied with social distancing,” he said.
 “Children only have one chance at education. Over the last decade we have made significant strides in closing the closing the gap between the richest and poorest in our schools. This lockdown has put that at risk.
 “If progressive countries like Denmark can be teaching children and have them back in schools, then so should we. The whole point about being a teacher is you love your job. It is a mission, a vocation, to be able to excite young minds.”
 Mr Gove said that crucially the R number – the transmission rate of the disease – remained below one, the level at which experts warn Covid-19 will begin to spread again exponentially.
 He said the Government was on track to meet its target of getting 18,000 contact tracers by next week, with 17,200 now recruited.
 As a result, the coronavirus test, track and trace programme would be up and running by the end of month, putting them in a stronger position to deal with any fresh outbreaks, he added.
 “As we make progress – and we are making progress – in keeping the R rate below one and in reducing the number of infections, so if there is an outbreak we can test, track, trace and isolate so the situation is now better,” he said.

 The Oklahoman
   
 STILLWATER -- Jaden Nixon was born in Texas but into an Oklahoma State family.
   
 His father, Jeroid Johnson, played football and ran track for the Cowboys in the mid-1990s. His mother, Tina Nixon, ran track at OSU at the same time, and that's where they met.
   
 As Jaden grew up, he was inundated with OSU fandom. He attended Mike Gundy's football camps. When the Pokes were on TV, the game was on in Jaden's house.
   
 But like many a teenager will do, he rebelled. Not in a dangerous way, but he pushed back against his orange-and-black roots.
   
 "I was against Oklahoma State for the longest," Jaden said. "I supported them, because my parents went there, but I was like, 'I'm not gonna go there, because my parents went there.'
   
 "You know, everybody's always against their parents when you're at that age."
   
 Yet as he grew into a talented high school running back, Jaden began to see that the legacy he'd been pushing away was luring him in.
   
 A three-star recruit out of Lone Star High School in Frisco, Texas, Jaden attended OSU junior day in February and scheduled another visit during spring practice, which eventually was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Gundy and OSU running backs coach John Wozniak extended a scholarship offer on April 1, and before the month was over, Jaden Nixon was a Cowboy.
   
 At 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, Nixon lists a 40-yard dash time of 4.37 seconds on his Twitter profile, along with a 10.6-second 100 meters in track -- which he might consider running at OSU as well.
   
 Nixon can't remember exactly when he made his first trip to OSU, but he's watched the growth of the football facilities for the better part of the last decade.
   
 "I've been around the program for a while and had the chance to go there a lot," Nixon said. "It's growing fast. It's the type of stuff that can help you compete as a football player and make you a better athlete in general. And they have great academic facilities."
   
 The academic talk is more than lip service from Nixon. Classwork matters to him and his family. Dartmouth was among the programs recruiting him before he committed to OSU.
   
 "That's one thing my parents preach daily," Nixon said. "They stay on top of me about that. And I'm truly blessed to have them doing that."
   
 The occasional jokes aside, Nixon's parents never pushed him toward OSU.
   
 "We don't want you to go where we went, just because we went there," they would tell him.
   
 They wanted their son to find his own path. It just turned out to be the same one they had followed more than 25 years ago.
   
 "They've always told me they just want me to go wherever God leads me," Nixon said. "Through this whole recruiting process, they've been telling me to go where I feel comfortable. OSU has definitely been a part of my life the whole time, but they just wanted me to find the best option for me.
   
 "God just put it in my heart that OSU is where I was supposed to go."

Critics have already accused the government of being out of touch by creating so many Cabinet posts at a time when unemployment has soared to 25% as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. But because Netanyahu’s bloc includes several smaller parties, he still only has a limited number of Cabinet ministries to hand out to the Likud rank and file, and he faced a mini- insurgency from angry senior members ahead of the planned swearing-in ceremony on Thursday. Unable to meet a deadline, Netanyahu asked for a delay to solve his internal party crisis. To mollify his backbenchers, Netanyahu presented a series of new, questionable ministries such as “community development,” “settlement affairs” and “higher education and water resources.”

 Like any idea which needs to be told and propagated, art and culture needs to be promoted for it to flourish. This involves travel, touring and going to places and meeting people and exchanging ideas. Art needs to be seen and appreciated. Physically! This itself is taken away by the present crisis. And the art fraternity is right in their apprehensions.
 ## The will to reinvent
 Art is the mirror of civilisation and a guide to the future generations.
 It has to reinvent itself and reinvent it will. Art has survived many tribulations and travails.
 In this lockdown period, we have enjoyed the nostalgia of reading _M_ _algudi_ _D_ _ays_ , watching _Ramayan_ , reading _bal-katha_ , grandmother’s stories and downloaded and relived our childhood memories through the art forms. Art has kept our morale high throughout the novel coronavirus crisis.
 All is not lost and would never be. Till there is life, our art forms and our traditions would keep garnishing and ornamenting the joys of life to make it liveable as there can’t be life without art.
 Like the life partner who, while a step behind, keeps her unconditional support going during the hard times. So, let our arts be that invisible source of strength to keep going until the tide turns... times to flourish are just around the corner.
 Art will keep its morale high despite the pandemic. Technology has provided a great and apt platform to meet and share, though virtually. Every museum, every performer, every art form is accessible on your screens. Surely the flood of choices has caused confusion and distraction in the minds of art lovers, but it is transient and the pure will be distilled in due course.
 Every being on this planet who has access to the Internet is using this medium to touch and connect. To provide to the love of art, every museum, every artist is finding a way to make him or her visible and not lose one’s audience. This has led to a trail of webinars, self-shot performances, online classes, challenges, and others. And most of them are free.
 The tables have turned. This shows that the art world is transitioning and trying to reposition itself. We don’t know yet whether that is a new normal or a transient adjustment.

Eight additional sailors aboard the coronavirus-stricken carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have now tested positive for the virus according to a defense official.
 These eight sailors had previously tested positive and were removed from the ship in order to self-quarantine. They had all tested negative twice before being allowed back on board before this latest incident of testing positive again for the virus.
 This latest development is in addition to five other sailors aboard the ship that CNN reported earlier this week who had also again tested positive after being thought to be clear of the virus.
 The carrier is heavily screening crew members for reports of symptoms. Some of the now 13 sailors who have retested positive in fact had reported symptoms to the medical crew, the official said.

Waffles are a brunch menu staple and one of those things we don't really make for ourselves at home—largely because they typically require their own special appliance. So for those of us who don't dedicate precious kitchen space to a waffle iron, homemade waffles have been off the menu, till now.
 Gaz Oakley, the chef behind the Avant Garde Vegan brand, gives the solution to this problem in his new cookbook _Plants Only Kitchen_ _._ This is Oakley's third cookbook and provides 70 of his favorite recipes for creating a vegan lifestyle, organized by whether you're looking for a quick cook or to batch cook for meal prep. It's here he shares this genius method for making waffles at home, no waffle iron necessary.
 Using a grill pan, first on the stove and then under the broiler, you can successfully mimic the fluffy but crisp texture of homemade waffles. The recipe is of course vegan but also made without processed sugar and can be adapted to be gluten-free. And you'll definitely want to follow his advice of serving the waffles with the homemade berry compote and a dollop of yogurt for the perfect weekend breakfast.

There is another group for whom I feel sorry — high school seniors. Among them is a Kansas cousin’s grandson whom I have never met but with whom I commiserate.
 If there is one phase of my life I would like to live over, it’s my senior year in high school. High school seniors are on top of the world. They feel as if they rule the school, think about the future, may have plans for college. Two of them are honored as homecoming king and queen or perhaps a midwinter dance. Then there is the highly-anticipated prom, especially for girls who look long and hard for the perfect gown.
 And, tragically this year, there are no spring sports. No way to strive for or defend a championship, no bonding with teammates. I would have hated not earning that fourth letter in baseball despite fielding and batting averages that hovered around .014.

Jerry and Penny Thompson and their children were the first residents of Hall Park in 1961. Ike Hall developed the all-electric community and needed at least 10 residents to incorporate as a town.
 "Since there were 11 of us -- you had to have 10 to be a city -- he (Hall) could apply to the state to be a town," said Bob Thompson, one of Penny and Jerry's sons and a former mayor of Norman.
 He said Ingels was passionate about his community and was a champion for the township.
 "He just wanted Hall Park to be the ultimate neighborhood," Thompson said. He said Ingels opposed annexation but after it was the only solution to the town's water, sewer and street problems he supported the cause and negotiated hard for the residents.
 • • •
 In retirement, Ingels created a walking area along the east side of the south Hall Park lake. He hauled gravel, large rocks, soil and rolls of Bermuda grass to stabilize the area.
 He designed and installed a "fish fence" to keep fish from being washed down the drainage ditch when big rains occurred.
 "I think he just had a very creative and problem solver personality," said Jane Ingels. "He was always interested and enthusiastic about construction projects -- both in planning and actually building."
 • • •
 Besides church and community friends and neighbors, three generations of the Ingels family help bring in the grape harvest.
 George and Jane took up the hobby in retirement. As with all of his endeavors, George was meticulous about every detail of the vineyard.
 They researched and visited vineyards around the country. George teamed up with an OSU professor to write a book on growing grapes in Oklahoma.
 The harvest had nothing to do with profits or losses. It was uniting a community of friends and family.
 "The goal we have is for you to have a good time," Ingels told us at the pre- harvest meeting. "I have trouble finding new words each year to thank you."
 Now, it's our turn to thank you, George. Our community is a better place because of you.

 Ireland, Norway and Canada will compete among themselves for two more seats. Meanwhile Kenya and Djibouti will vie for the only spot reserved for Africa.
 The vote is planned for June 17, but the letter seen Thursday referenced only the month of June, meaning a change of date could be possible depending on circumstances.
 According to the letter, the 193 General Assembly members will vote “by secret ballot without a plenary meeting.” Although no location was given, the vote is likely to be held at UN headquarters.
 In normal times, the annual vote to elect five of the body’s 10 non-permanent members takes place like clockwork during a well-oiled ceremony, with states placing their secret vote into a ballot box in the General Assembly’s main hall.
 In recent weeks, General Assembly members have expressed concern that their secret ballot might be revealed or that electronic fraud could take place, a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity told AFP.
 With the stakes high, competing countries have gone to great lengths to win votes.
 In 2018, Ireland curried favor with invitations to a concert by Irish rockers U2.
 The Globe and Mail recently reported that Canada had hoped to similarly sway states with a March concert in Brooklyn by Celine Dion.

SOMETHING that could help Livingstone Shire develop its first bushfire management strategy may be hiding in an unexpected spot - The Whitsundays.
 Cr Adam Belot will enlighten his colleagues further on Tuesday when the hot topic is raised at the monthly council meeting.
 The issue of bushfire mitigation reared its head again last week when long- time Emu Park resident Graham Miller said he was worried that authorities had not learned lessons from the Cobraball bushfire disaster.
 Mr Miller, a Rural Fire Brigade member of more than 40 years, has lived at Henry St for more than two decades and he said in that time, he had never seen fire mitigation conducted on Livingstone Shire Council owned-land adjacent to his property.
 This land is not the only pocket of land in Livingstone Shire that is causing residents concern. Last November, Brett Geissmann explained how his Lamberton Street home in residential Yeppoon was ­surrounded by council-owned bushland.
 He said in the 24 years he had lived there, authorities had never done any form of vegetation management.
 Mr Geissmann was very concerned about the level of overgrowth and how close that was to homes in the street, and his fears were elevated by last November’s Cobraball bushfires.
 Cr Belot, who, along with Cr Andrea Friend, personally met with Mr Miller at his property last week, has spent a lot of time researching ahead of Tuesday’s council meeting.
 “I can see the need for a paramount shift in the way that we, Livingstone especially, are managing fires,” Cr Belot said.
 “Interestingly, Whitsunday council has an extraordinarily descriptive document that basically comes down to nominating the addresses of blocks of land that are subject to a three to five-year regulated fuel mitigation burn.
 “That is extraordinary when you look at Livingstone, which has spent $7 million on a disaster management centre, and yet we don’t have a bushfire management plan.”
 Mayor Andy Ireland this week said the council was reviewing its landholdings as it worked towards developing a cohesive bushfire management strategy.
 Cr Belot said there were no illusions as to the enormity of the task ahead.
 “Unless we, as community leaders who are there now, are prepared to grab this thing by the horns and implement a policy which is radically different to the one we’ve got, we’re going to be in trouble down the track.
 “The likes of the Whitsundays have such a policy, and their terrain is fairly similar to ours in terms of the eucalypt forest and the like.
 “They use that (policy) to rate and score the potential for bushfires on that landscape.
 “That in turn tells them how often to burn.
 “Unless Livingstone is prepared to radically change, then we are going to see Cobraball all over again - maybe not this year but certainly in the coming years.”
 Cr Ireland said a detailed report on the comprehensive bushfire management strategy would be presented at a future council meeting in the coming months.
 He said upon completion of the draft strategy, the council would seek feedback through community and stakeholder consultation.
 Crs Belot and Friend intend to raise the issue of fire ­mitigation at Tuesday’s council meeting.
 Cr Belot said the pair endorsed the work already being undertaken by the council to develop a bushfire management strategy, but indicated they wanted to see the wheels turn quickly.
 “We will be emphasising the urgency in having the policy and strategy presented to council for adoption ASAP, given the next fire season is only months away,” Cr Belot said.

This morning, I went out to check on the garden’s progress. The tomatoes are chest high and loaded with fruit. Our potatoes are free of any insect infestations and are spreading. Onions are swelling, and peppers are growing.
 But something had been nibbling on my peas again.
 While standing there in the cool of the morning, I remembered my grandmother’s solution when I was a kid.
 “There’s a rabbit eating up my garden. Get the target rifle and get rid of it.”
 I was about fourteen at that time and the idea of taking the .22 out without someone standing over my shoulder was the best thing I’d heard all year.
 The sun was settling behind the hay barn when I went up there. The garden was a little over a hundred yards from the house and there were several places you could stand just outside the fence and wait.
 It didn’t take long. As dusk approached, a large cottontail appeared between the rows, heading for her peas. I clicked off the safety, aimed with the open sights, and ended that rabbit problem with the pull of a trigger. The good part was that there were more rabbits, so I hunted for the next two nights before there were no more bunnies.
 You can’t do that in the city, though. Even the report of a .22 pistol loaded with bird shot would be extremely loud and the acoustics between my house and the closest next door neighbor is deafening. Uh, make that would be deafening…that’s if I really pulled the trigger in the safest manner possible sending those No. 12 pellets loose, knowing they will barely travel over 50 feet that would of course be aimed downward where the cottontails might be feeding on my garden plants knowing there is a waist-high stone wall behind the garden topped with a twelve foot board on board fence protecting us from the neighbor’s dog…but we all know I wouldn’t do that because it would be so loud, if I did, but honest, I wouldn’t do that.
 Changing the subject, here’s what I’ve found. Squirrels love roasted salted peanuts in the shell.
 Rabbits are fickle. One day you can catch them with carrots or fresh apple slices, but the next day they’re looking for something different, like cheese biscuits, which I like too, so we have that in common.
 On the positive side, it’s a little bit like hunting, and when I release them, I get to drive into the country and enjoy fresh air, trees and green creek sides.
 Come to think of it, the next one I catch might have to be released on the other side of the lake, about fifteen miles away. I’ll take the rod and reel. I should at least get a little enjoyment out of all this, since I don’t get to shoot them, which I didn’t.
 Forget I said anything.

 “I didn't have any money left. My child was crying. I had no idea what to do. And so I left,” she said. Ms. Mahalakshmi said she survived the first month by herding goats but realised that she could not handle any further expenses. “There is no water supply to my house as well. I had to wait for two days for a tanker to come and provide us a pot for ₹30. I heard that life was much better in Erode. The only way to survive was to go to my husband,” she said.
 She had heard that migrants were walking all the way from Chennai to West Bengal. So she had the confidence to complete her journey. She said that the aim was to meet her husband as he was the main breadwinner of the family.
 Ms. Mahalakshmi said that she first walked towards Melur to sell her daughter’s silver anklets, her last remaining piece of jewellery for ₹1,000. She said that she needed enough money to last till Erode. When she was stopped at Melur, she thought she would walk to Arapalayam bus stand and catch a bus to Erode.
 “I had forgotten that buses were not plying. I stopped at Vadipatti check post to ask the police personnel for directions but they said that I should not travel without permission from the district administration. They redirected me to the Collector’s office,” she said.
 And then some officials at the Collectorate and the district Red Cross team assisted her by providing her with 20 kg rice, pulses and oil to last the month. They also drove her, her child and goats back home in a car.
 Madurai Red Cross secretary M. Gopalakrishnan said that they are also making arrangements to try and bring her husband back in a Red Cross van that regularly travels between the two districts.
 “Until then, we must wait,” she said.

 Two weeks ago, one of Uganda’s yuppies tweeted something that triggered a firestorm of criticism on social media against news organisations. Sheila Gashumba’s tweet was brief and to the point. She said she had stopped working as a TV presenter in part because she was being paid a laughably small salary.
 Social media went into overdrive, with many people saying that news organisations are exploiting their employees (which some do). Others told the yuppie that many young people start on small salaries, and once they have made their name and got to that stage where opportunities are looking for them—as opposed to young people looking for opportunities—they can land plum jobs and earn much more.
 Few things are more demoralising than working hard and not knowing how your bills will be footed because you earn a mere pittance. It makes a complete nonsense of paid work. You start to wonder whether you are really any different from those who are unemployed.
 For people working in the media industry, poor pay makes things even uglier. Journalists get to meet and hobnob with important people. They have the privilege of talking to and dining with people that ordinary folks can only see on TV. It goes without saying that they should have decent money in their wallets—at least enough to keep their heads above water.
 Yet in Uganda, the uncomfortable truth is that the pay for journalists is insanely low. It is forcing men and women who would otherwise be proper professionals to resort to unscrupulous and unethical professional behaviour to make ends meet.
 I do not know how reporters and editors of Kampala’s mushrooming news sites make a living, given the fact that no one buys their news and they get almost zero advertising revenue, but I would not be surprised if some of them routinely violated professional ethics to survive.

CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago’s lakefront planetarium will lay off 120 part-time and full-time employees because of revenue loss during the coronavirus pandemic. Adler Planetarium officials said they anticipate continued revenue declines and reductions were made across the organization, which just celebrated its 90th year. “The Adler made the difficult decision to reduce our staff in order to help the Adler survive and continue to serve Chicago and the world in the post-pandemic future,” Jennifer Howell, senior manager of public relations, said in an email. She said it is clear the planetarium won't be reopening for awhile. Gov. J.B. Pritzker's plan calls for certain metrics be met before certain businesses reopen to the public. His most recent stay-at-home order expires at the end of the month. The planetarium had 308 employees when it filed its 2018 federal taxes, according to The Chicago Tribune.

Because of our current shared global reality, I suspect we are learning to take better care of each other. We have opened our eyes to each other’s individual vulnerabilities, and we have felt empathy, and we are helping each other and making each other laugh and cry and feel better. Even our home planet seems to be healing overall, now that we’ve stopped – just for the moment – kicking our detritus and disrespect across her face.
 It also seems as if we are somehow rediscovering or revaluing our past lives – through our past work and knowledge, our ancestral wisdom – pulling it out from the backs of closets and the bottoms of shelves and the recesses of our collective memories. The works of long-gone authors are being reread, their words remarkably applicable to our hearts and minds today. Our art and music are being replayed – and “re-played with” – as the unique entertainment and encouragement and connection between our souls that they were meant to be. And set-aside scientific ideas and insights are being reconsidered and reexamined as well, for potential benefits and possibilities for our current wellbeing.
 In our renewed humanity, we have relearned how to dance with our children and play their games; how to appreciate our animals both in the wild and as companions. We’ve begun to read out loud to each other again, telling each other our stories. We’ve clapped our hands and made loud noises in the streets in appreciation for jobs well done. We’ve witnessed small kindnesses – we’ve been those small kindnesses – and recognized genuine heroism among us. We’ve shared our food and knowledge and humor and grief. We’ve learned how to work harder at just doing life. And perhaps we will reimagine and fulfill ourselves as something better and finer than we have ever been.
 And so, I suspect I will continue to wash my hands as I count to twenty, and even feel good about rinsing another bit of my current identity down the drain. Because in the end, I will be that much closer to touching not just my own authentic humanity, but the hand of another human being’s, held one day within my own. And that will be worth everything.

Her last film, _Sword of Trust_ starring her partner Marc Maron, is about a group of misfits who come upon a confederate-era sword that proves extremely appealing to White Supremacist conspiracy theorists who believe that the Confederacy actually won the Civil War and there's a vast Left Wing plot to cover it all up. Politically fraught to the point in this day and age of violent polarization, Shelton does the impossible in making everyone in the film somehow sympathetic. It's not "both-siderism," it's the harder-to-manage "humanism;" this gift of being clear about a person's failings without being hateful about their inability to overcome them. Losing Shelton at this moment in our history seems so large because we recognize her voice as one vital to any potential reconciliation for us as individuals and as a nation. I don't think Shelton could've saved the world on her own, but it's only people like Shelton — artists with some reach and opportunity — who could provide a way through the noise all the way back to some semblance of grace. John Keats has a line in his "Ode to a Nightingale" where he speaks of "the sad heart of Ruth when, sick for home, She stood in tears amid the alien corn." Shelton was a light we needed and she's left behind a legacy of gentle calls to our better nature. I hoped for more. I'll miss her very much.

Even with Jordan, the Bulls scuffled at the beginning of that season, starting out 12-9.
 Perhaps Jordan — who returned to play two more seasons for the Wizards in 2001-02 and 2002-03 — sensed that he would not be himself if he came back with the Bulls so quickly after the injury and that the burden of trying to lift them to the Finals again would have been enormous.
 “It would then have been easy to go on the disabled list with the finger injury and spend the rest of that strike-shortened season picking up checks every two weeks and not playing at all,” Krause wrote. “But Michael being Michael, once he signed a contract, he gave you a thousand percent effort and would not think of stiffing you.”

 If your company provides tuition reimbursement, you could get a master’s degree at little or no cost to you, since up to $5,250 of employer assistance is non-taxable each year.
 Health Savings Accounts are tax-advantaged and are used in tandem with high- deductible health plans. The contributions that you make to these plans are pre-tax, and any contributions that your employer makes on your behalf are not includible in your income.
 Such plans are of great benefit if you never have enough medical expenses to qualify those expenses as itemized deductions. Flexible Spending Accounts offer similar advantages.
 Investing your HSA funds can be a great way to save for the future, particularly if you are not using the monies to cover current medical expenses. Check with the plan administrator for costs and options.
 Employer Stock Purchase plans allow you to purchase employer stock at a 15% discount, so if the stock price never goes up, you are still dollars ahead.

Americans are navigating a patchwork of conflicting national and local guidance on masks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, initially downplayed the efficacy of masks but now recommends them.
 And they have become a ready symbol for those dubious about giving government officials wide powers for an extended period.
 Retailers find the confrontations over masks a minefield.
 “It is a very hot-button issue,” said Kenya Friend-Daniel, a spokeswoman for Trader Joe’s. The company declined to allow Jesse, the employee involved in the confrontation, to be interviewed.
 “We do not want to put our crew members in the position to have to enforce something like that,” she said, noting that customers “overwhelmingly” wear masks.
 In all its 505 stores, Trader Joe’s has put up signs recommending that customers wear masks, not least to protect its employees, Friend-Daniel said.
 Refusing is not grounds alone for being ejected from a store, she said, even where wearing masks in public is the law, but creating a disturbance that bothers other customers is.
 Target, in places where masks are the law, has stationed security employees outside its stores to remind customers to wear them, said Jake Anderson, a spokesman.
 Stores are not the only businesses involved. Uber announced that starting Monday, drivers and riders must wear masks, and those who refuse can be kicked off the platform.
 Smaller retailers feel especially vulnerable to balancing the need for safety and the need to revive their bottom line.
 In Charleston, South Carolina, at M. Dumas & Sons, a 103-year-old men’s clothing store, employees wear masks in line with a city requirement while customers are offered them at the front door.
 Gary Flynn, the owner, estimated that 50% of his customers would walk away if required to wear a mask.
 “I want whatever I can get right now,” he said, with business inching up but still only 25% of what it was a year ago.
 He acknowledged that his workers were putting themselves in harm’s way to generate sales. “So it’s a slippery slope, and it’s a moral challenge every day to try to figure out what’s the right thing to do,” he said.
 Farther up King Street, Las Olas Swimwear boutique was doing brisk business in bathing suits, for beach-starved customers, as well as face masks. The store has sold more than 500 masks produced by a New York swimwear supplier.
 Daniel James, the owner, stated unequivocally that he would fire any employee not wearing a face mask but said masks were voluntary for customers.
 In Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made masks mandatory in late April and allowed stores to bar customers who refused. But she did not criminalize such refusals, so police have only intervened when confrontations turned violent.
 In Illinois, Rob Karr, president of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, compiled a list of episodes that took place in the first 48 hours after masks became mandatory May 1.
 One customer threatened to get a gun from his car to shoot the worker insisting that he wear a mask. Several employees were hit, while others were verbally abused. Sometimes customers fought each other. The list has only grown longer.
 Some police departments refused to respond when stores asked for help, Karr said, while various retailers were fined $750 for not enforcing the ban.
 In Warwick, Rhode Island, a police union initially announced on its Facebook page that it would not enforce Gov. Gina Raimondo’s mandatory mask order, calling it “overreaching” and bound to destroy the bridge of trust built with the community. The police chief then issued a statement saying the department would act.
 Lawrence Gostin, the Georgetown University professor who wrote the draft public health law adopted by many states, suggested that in the absence of national guidelines, retailers should develop one policy for all their stores and stick with it, whether it has the backing of state law or not; that way the rules would be clear for all customers.
 Some experts also suggested it was overkill to involve police in the general enforcement of public health measures.

Coronavirus has infected over 4.6 million people and killed more than 312,000 worldwide, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts say undercounts the true toll of the pandemic. The U.S. has reported over 88,000 dead in the pandemic and Europe has seen at least 160,000 deaths.
 Professional soccer matches in Germany's Bundesliga resumed over the weekend, a move keenly watched by the rest of the soccer world as well as American sports leagues like MLB, the NBA, the NFL and the NHL, which all face major changes to their operations amid the pandemic.

The book is not sterile of spirituality, and such shading helps to give it a more rounded view of the human condition. 'Rama' itself is named after the Hindu god that is considered the supreme being, and the humans have a reverence for the impressive unknown quantity they simultaneously admire and fear. The spacecraft sent to examine Rama is called 'Endeavour' - named after Captain Cook's exploratory sailing ship that reached Australasia and made for the first European contact with a previously-unknown area of the world. Cook would, of course, later pay a heavy price for his encounters with other civilisations. The task of Commander Norton in Rendezvous with Rama is to keep every member of his crew alive throughout their reconnaissance mission.

Bill Clifford says he doesn’t just support conservative ideals, he lives them in his everyday life.
 Clifford, a Garden City ophthalmologist and Finney County commissioner, is running to replace U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall, who is seeking the retiring Sen. Pat Roberts’ seat in the U.S. Senate.
 “I certainly have lived my conservative values,” Clifford said. “I think it’s easy for folks in political office to just spout out, ‘Yeah, I’m for that, or I’m for this, or I’m with you.’ But I have a life of service and a life where I’ve lived my values.”
 Clifford, who served for 10 years in the Air Force as a jet fighter pilot, stopped by The Mercury on Friday afternoon to discuss his campaign to represent Kansas’ 1st Congressional District, known as the Big First.
 “I’ve led a life of service,” said Clifford, who is the chair of the Finney County Republican Committee. “I entered the Air Force through the Air Force Academy. I raised my right hand and swore to support and defend this country and the Constitution.”
 He is running against Tracey Mann, former Kansas lieutenant governor, and state Rep. Troy Waymaster, R-Bunker Hill, in the Republican primary in August.
 With agriculture being a significant part of the district, Clifford touted his agriculture plan, which calls for opening up trade markets and reducing the “artificial barriers” caused by regulations.
 He said he would push for “value-added” agriculture, meaning taking steps beyond initial growing for processing. He gave the example of Dairy Farmers of America opening a processing plant, where liquid milk is turned into powdered milk, in Finney County in 2017.
 “Now we dry out that milk right in Finney County, and incidentally, we get the water back, which is really great for us in southwest Kansas,” he said. “It has an added benefit.”
 Clifford said he felt a call to medicine, so before the age of 30, he retired from the Air Force. He trained in Oklahoma to become an eye surgeon, and moved to Garden City 25 years ago. Clifford and his wife, also a veteran, have six children, five of which the couple adopted.
 “We felt like we needed a small community that was welcoming,” Clifford said. “We have multi-racial children and we’ve certainly felt that southwest Kansas is a good fit for us.”
 He said defending the rights of the unborn is very important to him.
 “We believe very strongly in giving kids life,” Clifford said. “But that just doesn’t mean giving them birth. That means taking care of them once they’re born. That involves another part of our social system. We also have to support their moms and make sure they’re looked after. We’re obviously pro-life, but we’re very pro-adoption, and I think the government serves a role in supporting life and promoting adoption.”
 Clifford said he supports President Donald Trump, including his plan for a wall along the southern border with Mexico. “I believe in this president as a leader for this time,” he said.
 Clifford said he is discouraged by states that “are holding their citizens back” during the coronavirus pandemic, and said it is time to open up. He said the stay-at-home order was good to stop a surge of patients, but it’s time to reopen to get the economy going.

In the few months before the pandemic struck, the rapper and singer Guayaba performed about once a week throughout the Puget Sound region and boasted a full event calendar for the remainder of the year.
 Guayaba’s new album, "Fantasmagoría," released in November, met critical acclaim from regional tastemakers, snagging The Seattle Times’ Best Seattle Album of 2019. An intricate exploration of the beauty and darkness experienced within a Black nonbinary body, the album 1½ years in the making stoked a steadily growing fan base.
 Performing songs off the album at Seattle’s Belltown Yacht Club in late January, the audience flailed their arms and stomped their feet to the brooding beats and vocals that oscillated between rap and operatic-like choruses. The songs wove together English and Spanish in a nod to Guayaba's Afro-Latinx roots, touching on topics such as struggles with mental health and body image.
 Now, the complexity of the lyrics suddenly seemed to reflect Guayaba’s feelings as the short-lived glory of the album’s success was replaced by a fight to survive.
 “I didn’t realize how quickly it could be taken away, because none of us had prepared,” said Guayaba, who goes by one name and uses the pronouns they/them.

Unfortunately, to date, urban authorities continue to allocate land in their geographical jurisdiction, yet their power to do so ended in 1998. District Land Boards also continue to allocate land (correctly) but to people with no proper claim of ownership. The problem has, however, reduced because most of the urban areas have little or no land left to ‘allocate’.
 With the declaration of new urban centres and the expansion of their boundaries, this problem is going to escalate. The urban authorities will erroneously think that they have become landlords over land which actually belong to the people.
 Rural land that has now become part of the new cities has gained higher commercial value. The risk of those with financial or political muscle dispossessing the weaker members of the communities has also now increased. Land governance and urban planning will be a challenge. Dealing with these issues require enormous political will, administrative savvy and the support of technical experts.
 Customary land owners should get freehold titles. Those who own leases within the boundaries of the original urban centres should have their tenure expanded to 99 years! This will give a sense of ownership to the local people. If they decide to sell and relocate, they will have a better bargaining power.
 It will also enhance the value of their property and enable them to use the property as collateral to secure credit to upgrade their property rights or establish a business as a way to combat poverty. Urban authorities shouldn’t dispossess leasehold owners after a few months or years simply because they don’t have the means to develop the property to the standard of the city.
 What is to be done? Review the land tenure options with a view to integrating informal tenure systems into formal tenure systems. In order to empower residents to challenge illegal developments, the physical plan for the urban area should be public. Assess how upgrading infrastructure or new regulations will be. Build low cost housing for the disadvantaged people. Adopt a consultative and collaborative approach to ensure that people are not wrongly evicted or displaced.

An even bigger reason to participate in a 401(k) plan is the benefit of tax- deferred growth on your contributions. For example, say you earned $50,000 (in year one and received a 1% pay raise each year) and made a pre-tax contribution of 6% of your pay (forgetting about any employer match) to your 401(k) plan. At a 5% annual earning rate, you would have accumulated almost $47,000 at the end of 10 years. However, if you had to pay taxes on your earnings each year, you would have slightly more than $35,000 at the end of 10 years.
 If your company offers group life insurance coverage, remember that the first $50,000 of death benefit is free. If your company provides 2X your salary in life insurance and you earn the same $50,000 of income, you would have to include an extra $5 in your taxable income for the year if you are 40 years old. Bear in mind that you should have at least 16 times your annual income as a life insurance death benefit if you are married with two children. So, $100,000 of employer coverage plus $700,000 purchased from a life insurance company would provide your spouse with $800,000 of tax-free death benefits. That amount invested a 5% would provide her with $40,000 of annual income.
 Naturally, you should avail yourself of company-provided health insurance. If you have a choice between a health maintenance plan vs. a preferred provider plan, the HMO will be less expensive, but you must use the plan providers, so you may not be able to choose your own physician. Then, too, there are usually no deductibles with HMO plans.

 Uganda has decided to fast track its urbanisation. On July 1, we shall have seven new cities! This will come with serious challenges like few and poor quality housing, destruction of the environment, the risk of eviction, poor sanitisation, lack of clean water and electricity infrastructure, overcrowding, food insecurity, settlements in areas that are prone to natural calamities, lack of access to health facilities and increase in vulnerability of children, women and the poor and disadvantaged people.
 Urbanisation is a good thing. Development and urbanisation go hand in hand. Urban centres attract innovators and entrepreneurs. It is through urban areas that we become linked to the rest of the world. Urban areas make the highest contribution to GDP and the tax base.
 Urban areas are densely populated. This is propelled by increased birth rate and rural-urban migration. Other factors that push people to leave rural areas are underemployment, poor conditions for farming and conflict. Better economic prospects are also mainly found in urban areas.
 But urbanisation requires secure land tenure and property rights. Without them, urban areas cannot develop. Access to land is key in planning for current and future services. We must work, therefore, with the prevailing legal and institutional frameworks to ensure security of land tenure.
 There’s a misconception that urban land belongs to the urban authorities. When a place is declared an urban authority, nothing changes about the land ownership. Some urban authorities even give a leasehold over land which is held customarily. Urban authorities have the power to plan but not to allocate land.
 Since 1995, when the new Constitution was made and subsequently with the enactment of the Land Act in 1998, municipalities and town councils which had power to allocate plots in urban areas in line with their urban plans had their power limited and are now exercised through District Land Boards and only regarding land which is vested in the State! With the coming of the cities and declarations of various town boards, town councils and municipalities, there’s need to draw clear boundaries to the powers of the urban authorities to avoid confusion.

In 1965, they recorded a track called _CIA Man_ , which featured half a dozen very clear uses of the word in their excoriation of covert foreign operations by the U.S. Another track, entitled _Nothing_, also got a little effy halfway through.
 By 1969, F-bombs were coming fast and furious. The opening of the MC5's _Kick Out the Jams_ album. Jefferson Airplane's _We Can Be Together_ from their _Volunteers_ album. The _Hair_ soundtrack
 Once we got to the '70s, F-bombs were everywhere on record. The shock value evaporated. We even started hearing it on the radio with songs like The Who's _Who Are You_ all the way to The Tragically Hip's _At the Hundredth Meridian_ to _Killing in the Name_ by Rage Against the Machine.

 “I was here for a course in Robotic Head and Neck Surgery which was self- sponsored. I had to stay back as during the lockdown the course was near completion,” Dr. Kumar, who is on sabbatical from a prominent private hospital in Gurugram, told _The Hindu_ over the phone from Seoul.
 “I got this opportunity after waiting for 3.5 years and I am probably the first one from the country to do it. But it turned out to be a wrong decision. My course is over, but not my wait,” he said. Dr. Kumar was pursuing his course from Severance Hospital of the Yonsei University Cancer Centre.
 He is, however, not of the opinion that his wife, a senior doctor with the Delhi government, should stay at home. He, instead, wishes to return so she can work harder.
 “She was supposed to come here towards the end of my course but the pandemic had broken out by then. She is working round the clock and, as part of her duties, visits not only the hospital where she is posted but also containment zones. I am afraid anything can happen,” he said.
 “She will contract the infection sooner or later, given the circumstances. I don’t have any emergency like other Indians who are being taken home. I don’t know who will take care of my parents and my son in case my wife falls sick,” he said.

But because Netanyahu’s bloc includes several smaller parties, he still only has a limited number of Cabinet ministries to hand out to the Likud rank and file, and he faced a mini- insurgency from angry senior members ahead of the planned swearing-in ceremony on Thursday. Unable to meet a deadline, Netanyahu asked for a delay to solve his internal party crisis. To mollify his backbenchers, Netanyahu presented a series of new, questionable ministries such as “community development,” “settlement affairs” and “higher education and water resources.”

Locke grew up in Snohomish County with his mother, a single parent who worked. He was drawn to cooking right away. “The day care lady always had the Food Network on the TV,” Locke said. “The shows were pretty boring. I don’t know why, but I was fascinated.”
 In his early 20s, he decided to try to work his way up in the restaurant industry, starting as a dishwasher. That was tough.
 “You’re carrying tubs of dishes that can weigh 75 pounds,” he said. Locke was promoted to prep cook, then pantry cook, then assistant cook at a gastropub, cranking out burgers in a kitchen so cramped he could barely swivel around.
 Stints at Seattle restaurants came later. Though kids complicated his schedule, the industry was booming. Locke didn’t worry when he was laid off in February by a catering company where business was slow. He was sure he could land another job quickly, and he did. “I was going to learn how to smoke meat,” Locke said. “We were talking about soup specials.”
 The pandemic canceled those plans. Locke’s last day at the brewpub was March 15. He waited until early April to apply for unemployment benefits because he heard ESD was overwhelmed.

 Commenting on the announcements, GVK Reddy, founder and chairman, GVK Group said, “The move to invite PPP in six more airports will provide AAI the resources to develop smaller airports across the country and popularise the government’s Udaan scheme.”
 “The plans to make India a global MRO hub will ensure savings of precious foreign exchange and enable Indian airlines to get their aircraft serviced locally,” he said.
 Vasudevan. S, partner, Infrastructure Government and Healthcare, KPMG in India said, “Rationalising the MRO tax structure has been a long-pending demand of the industry and it is good to see that happening finally, but more needs to be done to create a level-playing field, attract foreign investment and make it profitable. If only the FM can extend the benefit to cover input tax reduction and waivers at least for exported services, as with other industries, it will become a game changer.”
 “The biggest upside will be its ability to create new jobs and a strong global value chain with the civil-defence business interface, which remains constrained and under-leveraged,” he said.

For an airport to be successfully privatised, it needs to have the kind of volumes necessary to ensure that the entity that wins the bid actually makes money.”
 “The only cities that could potentially fit the bill are Chennai and Kolkata. However, these cities were on the privatisation block back in 2014, and neither of them could move forward because of local resistance,” he said.
 “Post COVID-19, it seems that the state governments in both of these cities is unlikely to allow private parties to take control of these assets. Therefore, if there are no viable cities for which privatisation might be viable, the Government of India’s decision may be difficult to implement,” he added.
 Vishesh C. Chandiok, CEO, Grant Thornton India, said, “We need to see more details on the tax simplification, which will help in making India an MRO hub. I would have also liked to hear more relief measures for the civil aviation sector to keep it alive post-COVID-19.”
 Arvind Sharma, partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas said, “Better infrastructure should make air travel more accessible and there is a huge opportunity in this sector.”

"We are very fortunate that Norman and Cleveland County is in kind of an oasis where we've got all kinds of help from Community Mental Health, Center for Children and Families Inc., Mary Abbott Children's House, Virtue Center" and board members from those entities, Bonner said.
 One of the highlights of the program, Welbourne said, is when a child is invited to come up to the front with Bonner and bang the gavel when they are reunified with a parent or adopted into a new family.
 Bonner said he never takes home anything work-related, including good news from co-workers, such as pregnancies.
 "I learned to keep everything away. I have too much that is private," he said.
 Welbourned said Bonner has positively impact many people's lives, "and it's been wonderful to watch him with our family drug court families because he knows them ... He stands behind them and supports them in good and in bad because he has seen what they've done, the work that they've put in to put their lives back together, because when we get them, they're broken."
 Retirement
 Bonner said the coronavirus pandemic pushed him to retire earlier than expected. It also has changed his retirement plans.
 He said he would like to travel right now but can't and wants to stay put until a vaccine for COVID-19 is readily available.
 District 1 County Commissioner Rod Cleveland, who has worked with Bonner for 13 years, said Bonner has served the community "with great judicial temperament and a tremendous heart for the community.
 "I wish him well in his retirement and know that he will miss serving on the bench as much or more than I will miss him serving on the bench in working with him daily in the juvenile and family courts," Cleveland said.
 District 2 County Commissioner Darry Stacy, who was a police officer for 23 years before becoming a commissioner seven years ago, said he has worked with Bonner on the court and law enforcement side.
 He described Bonner as fair, just and having a passion for the people he serves.
 "He is a very humble individual that truly cares about the work that he does, and he affects the people who come before him," Stacy said. "Obviously, it will be a big loss to the court system as they try to find somebody to replace him with the knowledge and expertise and the years of training and skills that he has, but it's going to be a bigger loss to the community because of his passion for the job that he did."
 Balkman said he hopes that, in retirement, Bonner will continue to mediate cases. Balkman will take over family drug court and Bonner's dockets in his stead until July 1.
 Bonner said he is working on signing on as an active retired judge and plans on working part-time until his July 1 retirement date.
 "He's not built like me. If I was practicing at his age, I would want somebody to tackle me and make me quit," Mitchell said about Bonner and his retirement. "I'm sure he would like to keep on working. It will be a big change, and I hope he's able to adapt and enjoy life a little bit outside of the courthouse."
 Bonner, who moved to Norman with his family in 1948, said he has had lots of support including his wife of almost 53 years, children, grandchildren, a brother and friends.
 "I'm not trying to pat myself on the back. I think I've just been doing a job that needs to be done and wanted to do it to help the community. I feel blessed to have been appointed and able to do it this many years," Bonner said.
 Refilling Bonner's seat
 Balkman said Bonner's replacement will be nominated by the judicial nominating commission. Around July or August, an official notice will be posted for the position. Those applying must be licensed attorneys in good standing with the bar association, have at least five years of experience and must live in the county. The JNC interviews the candidates after a screening process and selects the top three. Those names then go to Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who makes the final hiring decision.
 Balkman said the position has a four-year term, and the person appointed will stand for election along with other judges statewide in 2022.
 Cleveland said he looks forward to working with the governor's appointee in continuing Bonner's legacy in the county.
 "I think the dockets that he presides over, it will be big shoes to fill for whoever takes over that docket. I think he takes a lot of pride in the dockets that he presided over," Mitchell said.

Anxiety was writ large on the faces of the passengers waiting for the Shramik Special train, bound for Bihar’s Aurangabad, to depart from the Dadri railway station on the outskirts of Noida on Saturday. The train was scheduled to start at 11 a.m. but pulled out of the station a little after 1 p.m.
 A handful of passengers could be seen stocking up water being provided by helpful residents of homes along the railway tracks for what would be at least a 14-hour journey, as the mercury rose in step with the sun. However, not even one of the 1,500-odd passengers, who boarded the train after two rounds of thermal scanning at the station, could be heard muttering a single complaint.
 The two-hour delay in the journey, according to the passengers, was “nothing” compared to the almost two months of hardship, uncertainty and endless wait that they had to face away from their families and amid a pandemic.

If you are employed by a company that offers an employee benefit package, or if you are considering a new position with a different company, it will be worth your while to review carefully what employee benefits are offered by the company. Many of the perks and benefits offered by employers are tax-free and no-cost, but even if you must pay a portion or all of the costs, your cost of a benefit offered through your company will usually be less than the price you would pay if you were to purchase that benefit on your own.
 Remember that all benefit packages are not the same, and if you are a mid- to- upper level executive, your employer may offer additional benefits that are not available to the rank and file. If you employer offers stock options or restricted stock units, I recommend that you review any such program carefully, since these plans can be wealth builders if your company is on the move.
 The first benefit that you should take advantage of is a 401(k) plan, particularly if your employer provides a matching contribution of any magnitude. At a minimum, you should make a pre-tax contribution that is large enough to obtain the employer match. If your employer matches 50% of your contribution up to your contribution rate of 6%, then, by all means, make that 6% contribution. Remember that in South Carolina, you save both the federal and state income taxes that would be due otherwise on your contribution.

The proposal of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to construct a sub-station on the premises of Anna University, Coimbatore, has run into rough weather because of the plot allocated for the project.
 According to a Tangedco official, one acre was identified initially for the project on the University premises and an alternative land was later provided as the area first identified was said to be on the proposed Western Bypass alignment. The Tangedco paid for the land three years ago and the contract was awarded one-and-a-half years ago. However, the official claims, for some reason, saplings were planted in the same area where the sub-station is to come up.
 Not all the saplings have grown into trees and these have to be removed to go forward with the construction work. “We will not be able to change to another area now as it will take longer time and lead to escalation of project cost,” the official says.

"We have to be so cautious with those funds and what we do with them," he said. "We don't want to end up later, coming back in an audit and having to repay anything. That's why it's so important to have professional help guide us through the process."
 Stacy and county staff interviewed a variety of management companies but ultimately requested a presentation from Witt O'Brien's.
 "They really are one of the premier countries nationally who are doing this," Stacy said. "We looked at several different companies and really thought they suited our needs and what we needed most. They're going to have the ability to actually bring people in, boots on the ground, meet with our officials and have one-on-one conversations and so we really like that aspect.
 "The cost incurred from hiring a management company, whether it be from the CARES Act or FEMA, is reimbursable through the act and the grants themselves. It saves us money in the long run. Not only are those costs reimbursable, but they have the ability and professional understanding to get so much more out of our request. They follow the projects through the beginning to end so they're there when we have audits at the end to assist in answering questions."

 “Some patients who were in extreme pain wanted to come in and we could do little during the lockdown,” said B. Murugan, president of the Tamil Nadu State Physiotherapy Council. On the request of the State Commissioner for Differently Abled, the therapists started counselling sessions over the phone or through video calls.
 On Monday, the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services issued guidelines for their operation. The council included a consent form stating that therapists had informed them of the process followed in the clinics.
 Now, clients must make a prior appointment. Only one attendant is allowed per client. The clinics must maintain records of clients and both the therapist and the client must wear masks and gloves. Clients must be provided with masks and gloves if they are not already wearing them already. The client’s temperature must be recorded and entered in the case sheet.
 The government has mandated that clinics must have a facility for hand washing near the entrance; thermal scanners must be used to measure clients’ and attendants’ temperature. The sheet on the bed must be changed for every client. Some clinics offer water bottles instead of placing a common dispenser.
 The air conditioner units have been switched off. The doors are left open. Therapists say they wear a face shield for additional safety.
 “I used to see 30 to 40 clients a day but now it is 10,” said V. Ramesh Babu, who runs four clinics -- two in Kancheepuram and one each in Velachery and Chengalpattu. He reopened the Kancheepuram unit three days ago. “Usually we would have 15 persons working, now I have only four assistants,” he added.
 S. Sivabalan. who runs a clinic in Thiruvanmiyur said that though the government had allowed for the operation of clinics from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., his clinic was open only till 1 p.m. “It is in the red zone and I don’t want to take the risk. I want to see how it goes,” he said.
 The therapists say it will be awhile before people venture out.

La Liga have told clubs they will be able to increase training to involve groups of up to 10 players on Monday as teams take another step towards the planned resumption of the season next month.
 The Spanish government has announced protocol that will allow training sessions to be expanded by all clubs, even those belonging to areas that are further behind in the country’s de-escalation programme.
 It means teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Aletico Madrid will be able to train in groups of 10, a source at La Liga told AFP, despite both Madrid and Catalonia remaining in ‘phase 0’ as two of Spain’s worst-hit regions by coronavirus.
 Espanyol, Leganes, Getafe and Real Valladolid will also be given special permission to do training in larger groups.
 The move comes as a boost to La Liga’s hopes of restarting the season in the middle of June and following the lead of Germany’s Bundesliga, which staged games behind closed doors on Saturday.
 Teams in the top two divisions in Spain have already returned to their training grounds this month, with players working individually as part of La Liga’s staggered programme, which includes regular testing and strict medical protocol.
 La Liga president Javier Tebas has circled June 12 as the ideal date for matches to return but admitted the exact timing will depend on the health authorities in Spain and the trajectory of the virus.
 According to an official statement by the government on Saturday, professional sports clubs “may carry out complete training sessions” while “complying with the corresponding prevention and hygiene measures”.
 The statement puts the maximum number at 14 for group training but La Liga have informed clubs the limit will be 10 on Monday.
 La Liga first suspended fixtures on March 14 and Tebas has estimated that failing to complete the season would cost clubs around 1 billion euros.

BELLINGHAM — Sharp-eyed dwellers of Washington’s northwest corner could look skyward in recent weeks and see thousands of snow geese — winter residents of the nearby Skagit Valley — gracefully winging their way north in a migration old as time.
 It was a welcome glimpse of seasonal business-as-usual — and a rare one. Most humans with designs on a northerly spring migration get stopped, cold, on roads or waters around Blaine, thanks to a virtual wall between the U.S. and Canada, the result of border restrictions imposed in March to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 Shutting the border to all but commercial vehicles and “essential” travelers in a region that once saw 14 million annual crossings has reduced auto traffic at Blaine’s Peace Arch border crossing by 98% — down to barely a couple hundred cars per day.
 Offshore — out of sight and mind to most — seaport towns in the San Juan and Gulf islands, where the border abruptly morphed from dotted line on a map to Sharpie-solid, lapping waves sound strangely loud at docks and wharves normally crawling with boisterous early summer boaters.
