SOUTH BEND — On a typical Notre Dame home game, Frank Adamek’s lot on Twyckenham Drive would be full of tailgaters long before game time.
 Around two hours before kickoff on Saturday, however, only a handful of cars sat in the lot as a dozen fans sat around in lawn chairs and passed around a football. All along Twyckenham the story was the same, as mostly empty lots and few fans reflected a more subdued game day atmosphere than the area around Notre Dame’s campus has come to expect.
 “We’re just happy they’re even playing to tell the truth,” Adamek said. “Everyone’s struggling, everyone’s suffering, we're hoping to get what we can get.”

In the long term, it has been found out that cannabis causes dopamine reduction. A 1998 study found that regular usage of weed for a long time, reduced dopamine levels in the brain's prefrontal cortex. Many other studies have also found a link between long-term cannabis use and depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. A recent study by Professor Howes in 2016, found out that long term exposure to THC produces complex effects on the dopamine system. The authors finally concluded that long-term exposure to marijuana will lead to mental health problems.

LPD officials and representatives from Flock recently hosted a Zoom meeting to discuss the program and its benefits.
 Lewisville Police Chief Kevin Deaver explained why Flock has worked for LPD.
 “Most crimes involve a vehicle,” Deaver said. “So I started looking at license plate reading cameras.”
 Deaver said he stumbled upon Flock.
 “After their demo I was sold,” Deaver said. “I thought it would help us prevent crime and solve crime.”
 Lewisville purchased 12 cameras in one of its highest crime areas. He said since April the department has seen an increase in the number of crimes that have been solved or the police have gotten suspect information on.
 Deaver described one incident in which a camera in Lewisville helped police track down a vehicle theft suspect, which ultimately led to the arrest of another suspect when he met up with the first suspect.
 Chase Ferguson, a sales consultant with Flock, described success the program has had in other parts of the country.
 Ferguson provided one example in Atlanta when the license plate of a vehicle belonging to a theft suspect was captured on Flock, and the suspect was later arrested. Ferguson said the man had 34 warrants out for his arrest.
 “He was able to be connected to hundreds of crimes all because this community had a Flock safety camera and were able to start solving crime,” Ferguson said. “We don't just want to watch crime, we want to solve it.”
 Deaver said while Part I crimes, such as violent crimes, have gone down in Lewisville, Part II crimes, such as theft, burglary, etc., have steadily gone up.
 “What we commonly see is people coming from other areas of the Metroplex to the suburbs or Lewisville to commit further crimes,” Deaver said.

 Listen to it. You’ll like it. But what does it have to do with sports?
 Everything really.
 “I learned through sports that the glory and success comes behind the scenes and not directly in the eyes of everyone,” Fairchild said. “What you learn from sports is that sometimes to get where you want to go in life, you have to dig deep in the moments when nobody’s looking. I learned how to work my tail off with the things that not everybody saw to have success in my sports. That’s carried over to outside of sports.

 Kelly came into the first-ever Atlantic Coast Conference game, Saturday at Notre Dame Stadium, with a 92-27 record with the Irish and 263-94-2 in his 30th year as a college head coach overall.
 Almost a third of Kelly’s losses with the Irish came during a 4-8 season in 2016, which included a 38-35 home loss to Duke. He fired his defensive coordinator, Brian VanGorder, the next day and then continued with more seismic changes during the offseason that included a reboot of his own coaching philosophy.
 "His focus has been really laser sharp, his relationship with this team is probably as strong as any that I've seen with him at Notre Dame, and those are all positives,” Swarbrick said of Kelly after the Irish started 2-5 in 2016.
 “Neither of us are satisfied with 2-5, but I'm at most of the practices. I'm at training table. I have an office at the Gug in addition to my other office.
 “I get to see the program day in and day out and I continue to have great confidence in Brian and confidence in our future as a program."
 Swarbrick’s confidence was rewarded with a 33-6 Irish run collectively in the three seasons that followed, which included the team’s first-ever playoff appearance in 2018.

And I would say that defensively this could certainly be considered the best- overall unit since the Peyton Manning era. In my eyes, you've got three All- Pro-caliber players entering the season in DeForest Buckner, Darius Leonard and Kenny Moore II (Moore II is yet to earn this distinction like the other two, but he is regarded as one of the top nickel cornerbacks in the NFL). There's Justin Houston, who has been one of the top pass rushers of his era and is still getting double-digit sack seasons, and then solid underrated starters like Grover Stewart, Denico Autry and Anthony Walker. You also have a few potential up-and-coming stars in Bobby Okereke, Rock Ya-Sin and Khari Willis, and, when healthy, Kemoko Turay. I'm also still very high on Malik Hooker, and if teams want to try to test this secondary more, believe he's prime to get interceptions in bunches. This has been repeated throughout the offseason, and we all need to see it in action, of course, but I think Buckner alone is just such a potential game-changer for this defense. The Colts haven't had a player like him along their defensive line in a long, long time. So I look forward to seeing how big No. 99 affects everybody else around him.
