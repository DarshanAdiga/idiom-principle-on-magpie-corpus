Throughout the book she consistently goes with the most extravagant estimates of his victims. He is probably responsible for 40million deaths, which still makes him one of the most bloodthirsty rulers of all time, but the 70million figure is way off the mark and I think is the result of bias on Jung's part.

I also expect Marathon Oil to generate free cash flows in the coming quarters while operating in the low-$40s a barrel oil price environment. The increase in oil prices will also push the company's cash flow from operations higher. The company has also done a commendable job of cutting its costs which have helped it in reducing its cash flow break-even point. The company is targeting $260 million of cash cost savings on an annualized basis. It has pushed its average completed well costs down by 10% so far as compared to 2019 and is expecting further cuts in H2-2020.


  Marathon Oil has been successful in consistently cutting well costs in its two primary shale oil plays since 2019. The company is on track to bring its completed well costs at Eagle Ford down to $700 per lateral foot in H2-2020. At Bakken, Marathon Oil brought the completed well costs down to as low as $500 per lateral foot for some wells in Q2-2020.


  What's great is that these cost reductions are primarily associated with the company's self-help measures, such as improvements in well design, and therefore I believe they will be sustainable in the long run. That's helped improve Marathon Oil's cost structure to a point where it can balance cash flows at low-$30s a barrel oil price environment in H2-2020. This means that in the current low-$40s a barrel oil price environment, the company will likely generate strong levels of free cash flows. This will mark a turnaround for Marathon Oil which burned cash flows in the previous quarter. As indicated earlier, the company generated $86 million of cash flow from operations in the second quarter which couldn't cover capital expenditures of $137 million. From this, we can estimate that the company faced a cash flow deficit of $51 million in Q2-2020 ($86Mn-$137Mn).


  In my opinion, Marathon Oil's cash flow outlook for 2021 is also looking good. That's because the company has said that it needs $35 per barrel oil price to balance cash flows next year with a maintenance capital budget that will keep the company's production flat at Q4-2020 levels. The oil prices, on the other hand, could end up averaging in the mid-$40s a barrel range in 2021, as indicated by the current futures. That's also in line with the US Energy Information Administration's forecast of an average 2021 price of $45.53 per barrel. This oil price scenario will enable Marathon Oil to post free cash flows in 2021 as well.

  Según fuentes consultadas por Goal, Suárez está dispuesto a tener una salida negociada. Si el club quiere que se vaya, le tendrán que pagar el año que le queda. Es decir, que si el Barça quiere liquidar su contrato, tendrá que abonarle 14 millones de euros netos, unos 28 brutos, en concepto de indemnización. Si no le paga ese año, Suárez seguirá entrenando. En caso de que el club decida pagarle, el uruguayo obtendrá la carta de libertad para firmar por otro equipo como agente libre. Según ha podido saber Goal, a Suárez no le faltan ofertas. Hasta cinco equipos se han interesado durante las últimas horas en la contratación del uruguayo.

LONDONDERRY, N.H. -- Fresh off accepting the Republican Party's nomination, President Donald Trump said Friday he was the only thing standing between "democracy and the mob," as he lashed out at protesters who accosted his supporters as they left the White House the night before.
 Sowing fear about the implications of a Joe Biden victory to battleground state voters, Trump held a rally in New Hampshire on Friday evening. Looking to close his Democratic rival's lead with just over two months until Election Day, Trump was launching an aggressive travel schedule -- and continuing to flout coronavirus guidelines.
 Trump opened his rally with a rant against demonstrators who confronted those leaving his convention speech on the South Lawn. Some guests at the political event, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, needed to be escorted by police officers to safety upon leaving the White House grounds.
 "They walked out to a bunch of thugs," Trump said, criticizing District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser for not doing more to protect his supporters. "Unhinged, manic rage. You ought to see last night in Washington, it was a disgrace."
 It marked his latest attempt to frame the general election as a dire choice between two futures for the nation -- a theme he was expected to amplify on the campaign trail.
 Trump said he directed White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to study how to call in the National Guard to the nation's capital. Trump previously ordered federal troops to the District in May amid protests over the killing of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police.
 "We're not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, and that's a big statement," Trump said. "But you know what we're going to do. ... We're going to have to look at it because we're not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country."
 Trump said the protesters were "anarchists," adding: "They're just looking for trouble. Has nothing to do with George Floyd. Has nothing to do with anything. They don't even know who George Floyd is."
 "The agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government," he added, saying voters needed to support him to "save democracy from the mob."
 "No one will be safe in Biden's America," he added.
 Speaking in New Hampshire, a state he lost in 2016 by fewer than 2,000 votes and is a top pickup opportunity for him in 2020, Trump repeated unfounded allegations that thousands of voters were bused into the state from neighboring Massachusetts four years ago.
 Trump also launched a new attack on Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris, speculating on the possibility that she could assume the presidency from the 78-year-old Biden. "You know I want to see the first woman president also, but I don't want to see a woman president get into that position the way she'd do it, and she's not competent," Trump said. "She's not competent."
 He suggested his own daughter, White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, as a more suitable occupant for the Oval Office.
 While the coronavirus kills 1,000 Americans each day, Trump defied his own administration's pandemic guidelines on Thursday to speak for more than an hour to a tightly packed, largely mask-less crowd. In New Hampshire, a campaign advisory said masks for attendees are "required" in accordance with Republican Gov. Chris Sununu's executive orders, and would be provided.

The game, held over from last season, finally got the green light to be played after Covid-19 restrictions were eased. In a major coup for the Southern Road club this is the second successive year that the Under-18 team has been crowned Devon's top cup side. A very good Totnes and Dartington side took the lead in the first half. However, Town skipper Jake Pond climbed above everybody else in a crowded area to head home an early second half corner and thereafter both teams went toe-toe to look for a winner. Town goalkeeper Will Davis made a couple of outstanding saves to keep the South Devon side out and, when the tie moved into a penalty shoot out, Davis twice made excellent saves while his team mates were clinical with their spot kicks as Town won the shoot-out 4-2. It was Nat Hawkins who held his nerve to net the decisive penalty to launch the post match celebrations.

Conclusion
 Ted Baker is still facing headwinds on numerous fronts as the company has tried to take greater control of costs and reduce its debt level. The pandemic came at an already difficult time for the company and has added unwelcome fuel to the fire. The company made the shrewd decision to look to the market for additional capital rather than take on significant additional debt. This capital injection does offer shareholders some increased optimism as the company attempts to steer the ship around. However, I believe that Ted Baker still has a long way to go in order to adapt to changing consumer trends and make a greater move online in a very competitive environment. I doubt the company's ability to achieve this and am therefore steering clear of shares.
