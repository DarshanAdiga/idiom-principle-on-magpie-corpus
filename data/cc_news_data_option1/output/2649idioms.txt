¿Y el dinero? Era la segura interrogante de la madre con mirada torva y fiscalizadora cuando el hijo llegaba de hacer los mandados y no entregaba cuentas claras del cambio de la pulpería. ¿Y el dinero? Es la pregunta obvia del gerente cuando encuentra faltantes en la rendición de cuentas del empleado. ¿Y el dinero? Es la pregunta de millones de hondureños desde hace varias décadas que observan cómo sus recursos son malversados sin ningún empacho por gobernantes descalificados y sin ninguna reserva moral. ¿Qué le parece si hacemos un poco de memoria histórica? Comencemos pues… ¿Y el dinero del pasaportazo y el chinazo a inicios de los años noventa? ¿Y el dinero en miles de millones de lempiras en ayuda externa para sobrellevar la catástrofe del huracán Mitch? Avancemos al nuevo milenio; ¿y el dinero del gasolinazo en el período 2002-2006? ¿Y el dinero de la cuarta urna de 2009? ¿Y el dinero del Trans 450? ¿Y los miles de millones de lempiras desfalcados del Seguro Social? ¿Y el dinero del covidazo 2020? Podríamos escribir tomos enteros de los actos bochornosos de corrupción en estas tierras; los ciudadanos nos seguimos preguntando dónde está ese dinero, aunque en el fondo nos hagamos 'los de a peso', pues conocemos muy bien la respuesta. Es absolutamente degradante observar el bajísimo o nulo nivel de crítica del ciudadano cuando en las redes sociales se desvive y debate sobre el Barcelona o Real Madrid; pero no dice ni pío de las carpas y toldos instalados de manera dolorosa, cuando el Estado fallido ofreció 94 hospitales al inicio de la emergencia aprobando miles de millones de lempiras. Mientras tanto el dinero que debe emplearse en los hospitales se esfuma y mágicamente aparece en las cuentas de los poderosos, que sin misericordia se enriquecen a costa de las deudas que el pueblo hondureño tarde o temprano tendrá que pagar.

Delhi University informed the Delhi High Court on Monday that Open Book Examinations (OBE) for under-graduate courses will commence from July 10 and those students who are unable to take them, be it persons with disabilities or others, will be allowed to appear for the exams physically in September.The varsity said this would be irrespective of whether students have filled up applications online or not and also in cases where they download the question papers for OBE but fail to upload their answer-sheets.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad, which was conducting the hearing through video conferencing, directed the university to file an affidavit clarifying its stand and listed for July 9, a plea challenging the conduct of online exams. "For purposes of clarity and to avoid any ambiguity, it is deemed appropriate to direct the Delhi University to file an affidavit clarifying its stand as recorded above and on any other aspect stated before us so that appropriate orders can be passed on the next date," the bench said. The court was hearing a plea by Prateek Sharma and Diksha Singh seeking directions to the Centre for setting up an effective mechanism for visually impaired and other disabled persons so that educational instructions can be transmitted to them properly and teaching material is provided to them through online mode of teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.The plea said that universities, schools, colleges and other educational institutions have engaged in online teaching amid COVID-19 outbreak, but no efforts have been made by the government to consider the need of the visually impaired and specially-abled individuals.The high court had earlier asked the DU why contempt proceedings not be initiated against it and its officers for trying to mislead the court by withholding information on deferment of the online open book exams.The exams, which were scheduled to start from July 1, have been deferred by another 10 days and will now commence from July 10.During the hearing, senior advocate Sachin Dutta, appearing for Delhi University, said that as a run up to the main examinations, the mock exams have commenced on July 4 and will conclude on July 8. Thereafter, the OBE will commence from July 10.He, however, submitted that if, for any reason, the students are not in a position to sit for the OBE examination commencing on July 10, all the students, whether in the PWD category or otherwise will be afforded an opportunity to sit in the examinations physically in September this year subject to pandemic conditions normalising.The high court posed certain queries to the DU as to the status of those students who are studying in the final year of the under-graduate courses and propose to seek admission in the post-graduate courses in the event they are not in the position to take the exams through the OBE system conducted remotely and instead elect to await the physical examinations proposed to be conducted in September, 2020.To this the varsity's counsel said such students will be provisionally granted admission in the post-graduate courses offered by DU subject to the condition that they meet the eligibility norms after the results of the under-graduate course are declared and subject to their appearing for the entrance examination.The high court had earlier pulled up the varsity for not informing it on June 26, when the matter was heard, about the decision to defer the examinations.The bench had said it came to know about the same on June 27 from news reports while it was in the middle of dictating an order to dispose of the petition on the basis of the DU's statement that it was geared up to commence exams from July 1.It had said that once DU had told it that it was fully geared up for holding the exams from July 1, any change in schedule ought to have been communicated to the bench. The DU, in its defence, had said the decision was taken after it came to know on June 26 at around 2.20 pm that the mother of its Deputy Registrar (secrecy) tested positive for COVID-19 and the entire family had to be quarantined.

TikTok will exit the Hong Kong market within days, a spokesman told Reuters late on Monday, as other technology companies including Facebook Inc have suspended processing government requests for user data in the region.The short form video app owned by China-based ByteDance has made the decision to exit the region following China's establishment of a sweeping new national security law for the semi-autonomous city."In light of recent events, we've decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong," a TikTok spokesman said in response to a Reuters question about its commitment to the market.The company, now run by former Walt Disney Co executive Kevin Mayer, has said in the past that the app's user data is not stored in China. TikTok has also said previously that it would not comply with any requests made by the Chinese government to censor content or for access to TikTok's user data, nor has it ever been asked to do so. The Hong Kong region is a small, loss- making market for the company, one source familiar with the matter said. Last August, TikTok reported it had attracted 150,000 users in Hong Kong. Globally, TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times through the Apple and Google app stores after the first quarter this year, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. The source said the move was made because it was not clear if Hong Kong would now fall entirely under Beijing's jurisdiction. TikTok was designed so it could not be accessed by mainland China. That was part of a strategy to appeal to a more global audience. ByteDance operates a similar short video sharing app called Douyin in China. Although there are no current plans to introduce Douyin to the Hong Kong market, a ByteDance spokesman said, the app already has a sizeable audience in the Asian financial centre as Chinese on the mainland travel and stay in Hong Kong.
