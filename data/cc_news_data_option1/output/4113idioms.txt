Governments worldwide are choosing to "turn a blind eye" to companies that pay foreign bribes to win business, an anti-corruption watchdog said on Tuesday.
  Transparency International said in a reportthat "many countries are barely investigating" the issue.
 "Money lost to foreign bribery wastes millions of dollars that could otherwise go to lifesaving services like health care," said its head Delia Ferreira Rubio.
 "Too many governments choose to turn a blind eye when their companies use bribery to win business in foreign markets."
 The Berlin-based organization said only four of 47 countries are actively enforcing legislation against foreign bribery.
 The report said the US, the UK, Switzerland, and Israel had led the way in tackling this form of corruption.
 The four nations represent 16.5% of global exports.
 A 1997 international agreement formally prohibits bribes to win contracts or dodge local taxes and laws.
 But it was struck under the auspices of the Paris-based OECD, which has no means of policing the accord or taking countries to task.
 China, the world's largest exporter, never signed up to the OECD rules.
 Transparency International said Beijing conducts "little or no enforcement."
 Its experts also found that Germany, the third biggest exporter worldwide, only carries out "moderate enforcement" of laws on foreign bribery.
 More than 15 years ago German engineering giant Siemens became embroiled in a global corruption scandal after it emerged executives had created a multi- million-euro slush fund to win contracts abroad.

 Transparency International says governments should move to end the secrecy surrounding the ownership of companies.
 The report also suggests increasing the liability of parent companies for actions carried out by their foreign subsidiaries.

Oct 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co comfortably beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit on Tuesday as trading revenue surged past its own expectations on the back of a rebound in global financial markets.
 Trading was a bright spot for the quarter, even as the pandemic decimated the U.S. economy, with thousands of businesses shutting down and the unemployment rate soaring. The economic fallout of the pandemic has triggered one of the worst recessions in decades.
 JPMorgan also benefited as it set aside less reserve provisions, compared with the first two quarters of the year. Revenue from capital markets and investment banking also helped offset declines in its consumer business.
 The bank's trading revenue jumped 30% to $6.6 billion.
 The biggest U.S. lender set aside $611 million for loans that may go bad, less than the $10.5 billion it put away against future losses in the previous quarter.
 The bank's net income rose to $9.44 billion, or $2.92 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $9.1 billion, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier.
 Analysts on average had expected earnings of $2.23 per share, according to Refinitiv.
 JPMorgan's net interest income fell 9% to $13.1 billion as the U.S. Federal Reserve kept rates at nearly zero to offset the impact of the pandemic.

Governments 'turn a blind eye' to foreign bribery: Transparency International

 LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell on Tuesday after reports that China has halted coal imports from the country as their relations deteriorate, while the U.S. dollar recovered from a three-week low plumbed the day before.
 The dollar index against a basket of currencies edged up 0.1% to 93.18 after Chinese authorities appeared to be trying to put a brake on recent rises in the yuan, one of the basket's components. It remained close to the three-week low of 93 it fell to on Monday.
 Against the euro, the dollar rose 0.2% at 1.1788. News that a Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 study was paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant contributed to a modest dollar rise.
 The fact that investor sentiment in Germany fell by more than expected in October failed to leave a mark on the euro.
 Investors will be looking for the U.S. consumer price index at 1230 GMT. Economists polled by Reuters expect the CPI rose 0.2% month-on-month in September, compared with 0.4% the month before.
 The U.S. currency's safe-haven appeal was limited by growing expectations former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's win in the Nov. 3 presidential election would bring large stimulus for the pandemic-hit economy, bolstering the stock market and investor risk appetite.
 The Australian dollar was last down by 0.3% at 0.7194 against the U.S. dollar as coal, the country's key export commodity, came under threat. It also fell 0.3% against the New Zealand dollar.
 State-owned utilities and steel mills in China received notice from China's customs to stop importing Australian thermal and coking coal. Analysts, however, said both the country and its currency should weather the storm.
 Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, noted that it is easier to find another supplier for thermal coal than it is for coking coal, making it difficult to substitute Australian coking coal.
 "There is still a clear symbiotic relationship between the two nations in as much as Australia is still reliant on exports to China and China is reliant on the higher quality coal and iron ore from Australia while it rebuilds its economy," Craig said.
 Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe Generale, said the Aussie dollar should also remain supported by Australia's strong fiscal stimulus.
 Deutsche Bank analysts found that Israel, Singapore and Australia would be the biggest beneficiaries from the announcement of a vaccine.
 The Chinese yuan rose 0.1% at 6.7328 per dollar in the offshore market. The central bank set a weaker-than-forecast midpoint, offseting any boost from strong Chinese trade data.
 China's central bank also announced over the weekend the removal of reserve requirements for some foreign exchange forwards, cementing speculation Beijing wants to curb the yuan's strength.
 Elsewhere, the British pound fell 0.2% against the U.S. dollar at $1.3037, but was neutral against the euro at 90.45 pence.

 LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - European shares struggled on Tuesday as worries over the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed Chinese trade data that pointed to a buoyant recovery, while the U.S. dollar edged away from a three-week low.
 The Euro STOXX 600 fell 0.4% before trimming losses, with markets in Frankfurt, London and Paris mirroring its moves. It was last down 0.2%, on course to end three straight days of gains.
 Keeping markets on edge, traders said, was news that Johnson &amp; Johnson was pausing its COVID-19 vaccine candidate clinical trials because of an unexplained illness in a study participant.
 Investors see the quick introduction of a vaccine as key to helping economies recover. J&amp;J's move comes after AstraZeneca paused late-stage trials of its experimental vaccine in September, also due to a participant's unexplained illness.
 The travel and leisure and autos sectors suffered, losing 1% and 0.3% respectively after heavier falls in early trading.
 Wall Street was also set to lose ground. S&amp;P 500 futures recovered most of their earlier losses to trade down 0.1%.
 The risk-off mood contrasted with earlier resilience for Asian markets. They recovered losses after Chinese data showed exports rising 9.9% in September and imports swinging to a 13.2% gain versus a 2.1% drop in August.
 The data, which suggests Chinese exporters are recovering from the pandemic's damage to overseas orders, helped MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gain 0.2%.
 Chinese blue-chip shares added 0.3% after dipping early in the day. Some investors, though, raised questions about how strong consumer demand would prove to be.
 "The question is not necessarily how China's trade is doing per se, but how well will consumers spend on Christmas to give some sense of normalcy amid a period of great stress," said Nordea Investments' Sebastien Galy in a note.
 Currency traders were also watching Chinese trade-related issues. Reports that Beijing has stopped taking shipments of Australian coal caused the Australian dollar to drop as much as 0.6% to $0.7165 .
 The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in nearly 50 countries, fell 0.1%.
 Government bond yields in the euro zone held near recent troughs, with hefty supply failing to dent a market bolstered by expectations for further central bank easing.
 Germany's 10-year Bund yield touched -0.538%, its lowest in just over a week. Italian and Greek benchmark 10-year debt both hit record lows.
 STIMULUS HOPES
 Investors increasingly expect Democratic candidate Joe Biden will win the U.S. presidential election next month. That would probably lead to a big stimulus package to help the coronavirus-battered U.S. economy.
 "Biden effectively leading in the polls is removing some element of uncertainty," said Jeremy Gatto, an investment manager at Unigestion in Geneva. "In investors' minds, it's not a question of if we get a stimulus, but when."
 Some expect a Biden win to undermine the U.S. dollar, since he's pledged to raise corporate tax rates. But the dollar rose 0.2% against a basket of other currencies to 93.214, trying to extend a rebound from Friday's near-three-week low of 92.997.
 The Chinese yuan fell 0.1% to 6.7466 per dollar, after the central bank set a weaker-than-forecast midpoint, offsetting any boost from the trade data.
