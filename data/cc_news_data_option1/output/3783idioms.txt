"Social distancing," "Socially isolated," "Unprecedented times," "Alone but together," "Stay home; stay safe," "Socially connected," "New normal."
   
 Just a few of many sound bytes that are currently streaming across our conscious world for the past several weeks that will warrant their places in our dictionary in the future, rightfully. As of a few months ago, it was a normal world. That is, a world where most of us went about our regular lives -- at work, at home and in between.
   
 Until a tiny little virus got into our society, our human society. The coronavirus, known for causing the disease COVID-19, has brought about a change like nothing we seemingly have ever experienced before, in a world that over 6 billion human beings call home. Here we are in the wake of the 21st century amid a pandemic that has sickened millions coupled with many thousands of fatalities. Until we show the virus a suitable and permanent egress, mere numbers of human mortality tell us it is here to stay for an undetermined time.
   
 The adage "necessity is the mother of invention" has never proved more true than now, as changes beyond anyone's imagination have sprung up. When the critically necessary masks for medical personnel ran out of supply, reinventing sterilization of the masks proved a clear win, fast. Vaccines that traditionally consumed years to develop are rushing at an unfathomable speed of promise to effectively destroy the virus. Medical care through virtual telemedicine is burgeoning in the hope of coupling timeliness with attention. Medicines morphing out of existing ones for other known ailments are offering more promise for the near future.
   
 In order to abide by the rightfully mandated physical distancing, work has become more portable than ever. Digital channels have innovated to an extent that workplaces seem closer together in virtual spaces. Food, an innate human need, has filled the lack of traditional restaurants during this isolated time into innovative delivery straits.
   
 Learning in a traditional sense of a brick and mortar university and school campuses is now abuzz with digital channels running full. In homes, dining tables are claiming their right beyond holding food with lessons on laptops. Libraries are ever more piling up on reading material in bytes rather than paper. One who could not imagine a physical workout without being in a gym or studio is now training as much or perhaps more in the virtual universe.
   
 Times could not seem harder and more exhausting for the world now. Despair appears to have settled into its home in this world. There has been no other time when hope, the sole elixir, has been so relied upon. That a pandemic seemingly wants us to believe that it is holding us hostage has only made our own human efforts much stronger in eradicating it.
   
 Perhaps our work at home becomes no more a privilege but a more productive option for many trades. Perhaps we as a citizenry will strike the right balance between individual liberties and collective responsibility toward a path to survival. Perhaps we will relearn to enjoy the calm environment and actually hear the bird songs. Perhaps we think twice about clean air before planning that next airline trip. Perhaps we think about our "needs" before we feed our "wants." Perhaps this universal reset was inevitable and we react responsibly, transcending the feelings of anger, cynicism and divided opinions on solutions.
   
 Many years ago, Charles Dickens penned: "It was the best of times; it was the worst of times," and now is the time for us to believe that the worst will not only be over, but we win as a human world.

Brewers left-hander Brett Anderson (3-3, 4.38 ERA) makes his second start since he was scratched because of hip tightness.

I don't know the names of the people I toiled alongside: The man who wrestled a frightened horse into a trailer, walked away with a broken nose and a cracked tooth and responded, "Sh-t happens. Horse got loaded and no one else got hurt," before asking where he was needed next. The single mother of four who agreed to take in 13 dogs and put their owner up in the travel trailer in her driveway. The man who spent two sleepless days and nights rescuing animals before going home to find his own house ablaze, who "in an effort not to feel sorry for myself" got back in his truck and started delivering donated hay to the folks sheltering the animals he'd saved. And the legions of anonymous people - many of whom had squared off against each other nightly for months in Portland's ongoing protests - all driving toward danger because strangers needed help.

The ongoing efforts to paint Trump in a green light aren't matched with substantive policy. Trump's environmental agenda has consisted largely of undoing rules and regulations created under President Barack Obama, from a rollback of vehicle emissions standards to a nixing of emissions rules for power plants to the departure from the Paris Agreement, the landmark global deal aimed at combating climate change. A Sept. 17 analysis from the Rhodium Group, an independent research that analyzes energy and climate data, found that Trump's climate rollbacks could add as much as 1.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2035. That's about a third of the country's emissions last year.

The US Department of Agriculture will provide an additional $14 billion for agricultural producers who continue to face market disruptions and associated costs because of COVID-19, according to a USDA release. Signup for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP 2) will began Sept. 21 and runs through Dec. 11.
 “America’s agriculture communities are resilient, but still face many challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. President Trump is once again demonstrating his commitment to ensure America’s farmers and ranchers remain in business to produce the food, fuel, and fiber America needs to thrive,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. “We listened to feedback received from farmers, ranchers and agricultural organizations about the impact of the pandemic on our nations’ farms and ranches, and we developed a program to better meet the needs of those impacted.”
