EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — There is no telling what a championship parade might look like in a pandemic. If the Dallas Stars don't stop taking so many penalties, they won't have to worry about that.
 It's hard to win a hockey game taking three penalties in the first 13 minutes, especially against a dangerous power play that can snap the puck around with ease.
 That is exactly what the Stars did to open Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final on Monday night, digging themselves a hole too deep to climb out of and allowing the Tampa Bay Lightning to tie the series with two crucial power-play goals in a 3-2 win.
 “That’s where we lost the game," said Stars forward Mattias Janmark, who took the first penalty of the game. “We don’t want to take penalties. We have taken way too many throughout the playoffs. But then, I think, when we get them, we’ve just got to go out and kill them and we didn’t manage to do that today and I think that’s where they won the game.”
 At 5-on-5, Dallas is outplaying Tampa Bay and may only have its lack of discipline to blame for not being up 2-0. Penalty trouble is finally hurting the Stars, who have taken by far the most minors this postseason and must fix the problem to keep their title hopes alive.
 "We need to stay out of the box. It helps," veteran forward Joe Pavelski said. “When we stay out of the box, we’ve showed it so far that we’re a good team.”

ATLANTA (AP) — At the start, it looked like a slugfest.
 By the end, it came down to defense.
 The Braves ad-libbed a brilliant double play to snuff out a potential Miami comeback in the ninth, moving Atlanta a step closer to a third straight NL East title with a 5-4 victory over the second-place Marlins on Monday night.
 With speedy pinch-runner Monte Harrison at first, Matt Joyce hit a high chopper behind the mound that was fielded by Braves closer Mark Melancon. While he made the throw to retire Joyce, Harrison noticed third base wasn't covered and kept right on running around second.
 Third baseman Austin Riley had gone after the ball and wasn’t in position, but shortstop Dansby Swanson alertly took off running for the bag. First baseman Freddie Freeman hit the moving target with a perfect throw, and Swanson was able to leap at Harrison and swipe him on the left hip a split-second before he got a hand to the bag on a headfirst slide.
 “I saw the ball coming right back at me really quickly. Freddie turned and launched it right over my head,” said Melancon, who dropped to one knee to avoid getting struck. “It was definitely a heads-up play there by Dansby. Just an athletic play all around. That was fun.”
 Swanson celebrated by pounding his glove into the dirt. Brian Anderson flied out to deep right to end the game, giving Melancon his 11th save and putting the Braves in position to clinch the East title as soon as Tuesday.
 “That was amazing,” manager Brian Snitker said. “Just amazing.”
 Even with the loss that dropped them four games behind Atlanta with six to play, the Marlins are still positioned to earn their first playoff berth since 2003. But they've got a tough final week, with three more games in Atlanta and a weekend series against the New York Yankees.

“This was a playoff atmosphere,” said Miami starter Trevor Rogers, who bounced back from a rough start to keep the Marlins in the game. “There’s obviously no fans, but this was a very, very good ballgame. It’s coming down to the wire.”
 Riley's two-run double capped a wild first inning in which the Marlins scored three in the top half with a barrage of singles — and the Braves responded with four runs in the bottom half. In all, the opening frame took 45 minutes and 74 pitches to get through.
 There were only two more runs the rest of the way as both teams got stellar performances from their bullpens. Three Miami relievers combined for four hitless innings after Rogers (1-2) left, while the Braves surrendered only one run over the final six innings.
 Tyler Matzek (4-3) pitched two hitless innings for the win, and Darren O'Day and Chris Martin each worked a scoreless frame. Will Smith escaped a bases- loaded jam in the eighth after Shane Green surrendered a two-out run. With a big assist from the defense, Melancon finished it off.
 The Marlins got things rolling against Huascar Ynoa with RBI singles from Jesus Aquilar, Anderson and Garrett Cooper.
 The Braves bounced right back against Rogers, who created a mess for himself by walking Ronald Acuña Jr. and Freeman to start the inning. Travis d'Arnaud brought home a run with an infield dribbler, Ozzie Albies ripped a run-scoring single to center and Riley doubled into the right-field corner to put the Braves ahead 4-3.

Evacuation orders and warnings are in place for thousands of residents in foothill and desert areas, where semi-rural homes and a popular nature sanctuary have burned. Statewide, at least 23,000 people remain evacuated, Newsom said.

 "It's slightly cooler too, so hopefully that will be a help to firefighters," Smith said.
 Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger U.S. wildfires to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas, especially because climate change has made California much drier. A drier California means plants are more flammable.

 Early estimates are that 6,400 buildings have been destroyed across the state, but Newsom said "by no stretch of the imagination do we think this tells the entire story." Damage assessments are ongoing, he said.

ATLANTA (AP) — Austin Riley's two-run double capped a wild first inning and the deep Atlanta bullpen took it from there, allowing just one run over the final six innings to push the Braves a step closer to a third straight NL East title with a 5-4 win over the second-place Miami Marlins on Monday night.

Will Smith escaped a bases-loaded jam in the eighth, and Mark Melancon benefited from a brilliant defensive play to claim his 11th save. Melancon surrendered a leadoff single to Jesus Aguilar, and speedy Monte Harrison took over as a pinch runner. Matt Joyce hit a high chopper near the mound that was fielded by the pitcher, whose only play was to first. Harrison kept right on running around second, but first baseman Freddie Freeman made a perfect throw to shortstop Dansby Swanson scrambling toward third.

 # Opinion: Teachers could benefit from pandemic reforms
 Christian Barnard
 View Comments
 Michigan legislators are likely to implement budget stabilization funding (or “hold harmless” funding) for districts, a provision that could be unfair to schools that have attracted more students because of their effective responses to the pandemic. Pushed by state teachers unions, this funding measure has school choice advocates frustrated. Similar kinds of bitter political battles are playing out nationwide.
 Some school choice proponents are accusing teacher associations of resisting change and public safety adaptations to protect their own paychecks, while some teacher union representatives insist that their opponents are recklessly trying to undermine the public education system and endanger kids and teachers.
 But it is a mistake for education reformers to intentionally alienate teachers in dealing with the current crisis and the future of education — because their goals are far more aligned than they may appear. Instead, they should seek to win teachers over by demonstrating how their proposals would generate long- term benefits for educators and students alike.
 With the growth of school choice and other policy innovations over the last few decades, the United States has already gotten a taste of how the education system can be disrupted to better serve both educators and families. Now, the pandemic is driving things further, with unprecedented numbers of families exploring virtual schooling and homeschooling “pods” (essentially homeschooling co-ops for small pools of families). Admittedly, this seemingly free-for-all environment can feel threatening to educators, and that’s a problem.

 From a political strategy perspective alone, it’s foolish to threaten teachers. As the American Enterprise Institute’s Director of Education Policy Studies Frederick Hess frequently points out, teachers are highly respected by the American public and wield substantial political power. Alienate them, and the ability to form the needed coalitions around systematic education reform is undermined.
 But it’s also often unnecessary to pick fights with teachers. Especially when, as in many cases, they could be your allies. The education status quo has failed educators as often as it has failed families. Decades of flat salaries despite increasing education funding, poorly managed public retirement systems that only favor a small group of senior teachers, classroom micromanagement driven by high-stakes testing — the list of policy failures that have negatively impacted teachers is long.
 To be fair, teachers and district school administrators are right to be concerned about how immediate coronavirus responses, such as sending some public education funds directly to families and allowing more education providers to enter into the market, could affect them in the short-run as they are already grappling with the pandemic. But in the long-term, teachers have as much to gain from an overhaul of the current system as families do.
 And here’s where reformers and education choice proponents have much to offer. Research suggests that school choice competition can lead to better compensation for teachers. Moreover, the influence of charter and magnet schools, student-based funding, online learning and other education reforms have challenged conventional understandings of what teaching should look like and what it means to be a “good teacher.”
 Currently, many teachers are receiving offers from families to facilitate learning pods for their kids in the fall that in some cases rival their school salaries. In response, some public schools are figuring out how they could facilitate learning pods themselves to enable broader access. Some experts are starting to formalize the concept of “charter teachers,” who could be authorized, like charter schools, by school districts or state education boards to provide free education directly to families in different environments.
 These innovations and others — if allowed to further flourish after the pandemic — could present better earnings potential for teachers, provide a much-needed check on top-down curriculum requirements and standardized testing, and give power back to the educators and families who are best- situated to know what students need.
 The American public is questioning now more than ever why more education dollars aren’t making it into teacher paychecks and why so many educators are burning out, and they’re coming up with potential solutions. Improving K-12 learning requires that all stakeholders abandon zero-sum thinking. Reformers and school choice advocates would be wise to listen to teachers and demonstrate how their proposals can make them better off.
 Similarly, teachers need to recognize that the institution they are protecting doesn’t always return the favor.

More affordable housing options in Bee Cave will soon be implemented in an effort to help improve traffic, following a City Council workshop Sept. 14.
   
 The city hosted a workshop to discuss, and allow the council to provide feedback on, city projects that include more affordable housing options and more roads.
   
 According to 2017 U.S. Census data, Bee Cave is home to more than 6,800 people and about 6,000 jobs citywide. City officials said about 60% of that workforce is made up of retail and food service workers, and educators.
   
 As a hub for restaurants and shopping, and with the many schools and day cares in the area, it was not a surprise to city staff to report the results, said Assistant City Manager Lindsey Oskoui.
   
 But what continues to be an issue, she said, is affordability and the traffic congestion associated with people commuting to work each day from more affordable areas outside of the Bee Cave area.
   
 Commuters, congestion
   
 Out of the 6,000 jobs, city officials said that 139, or 2.3%, are held by people who live in Bee Cave.
   
 "We have a lot of people coming into the Bee Cave, and most are people who work here," Oskoui said, adding that more than 20% of workers are commuting over 50 miles per day to work, and about 26% are between 10 to 20 miles per day.
   
 To proactively address congestion, officials said, it will be beneficial for Bee Cave to consider ways to limit the number of trips on its roads. That can be accomplished a number of ways, including improving collector networks, officials said.
   
 As more drivers are expected to be using the city's main roads Texas 71, Bee Cave Road, RM 620 and Hamilton Pool Road the city is focusing on improving the system to meet the demands on the corridor.
   
 The city's plan calls for several road realignments to help connect them to other major thoroughfares, including proposed roads at the Village of Spanish Oaks and the Backyard developments, as well as proposed changes to roads west of Hamilton Pool Road and Bee Cave Parkway.
   
 "We can't go wrong if we are always looking at more paths of transportation and better, additional places for all these cars to go," said Council Member Andrew Clark.
   
 The Vail Divide Drive extension to Hamilton Pool Road, which is being handled by Travis County and the Lake Travis school district, is set to begin construction within the next year, and city staff said that should help alleviate some traffic on Hamilton Pool Road, along with the widening of the road.
   
 The Hamilton Pool Road expansion, being built by the Texas Department of Transportation and Travis County, will stretch from Texas 71 to RM 12. Oskoui said that the project is being designed and will go out for bid in May to begin construction in summer 2021.
   
 Council Member Jon Cobb said that road improvements are important, but one concerning thing is the impact the community is seeing from people driving into and through the Bee Cave area.
   
 "Lots of people come through Bee Cave every day," he said. "I think it's time to be pushy with TxDOT and let them know we have a big issue in our community. We need to be a lot more forceful with them about how important transportation is to our community."
   
 However, some city officials said reducing commute times is possibly the best way to ease traffic congestion.
   
 Since public transportation is a nonstarter for Bee Cave, city officials said that means creating more affordable housing near where the jobs are.
   
 More housing
   
 There are just under 4,000 total housing units in Bee Cave, according to city officials, and that is split evenly between single and multifamily housing. The median home price sits just below $600,000 and rents range between just over $1,350 to just over $2,300.
   
 "The general rule of thumb is that housing should not exceed 30% of a person's income," Oskoui said.
   
 She said to be able to afford a home in Bee Cave would mean about a $160,000 total household income. For rent that means making $54,600 a year for a one bedroom apartment.
   
 But with a majority of the workforce retail, restaurant, educators and public safety workers making below that threshold, the city is seeking ways to help make housing more affordable.
   
 A teacher with one year of experience starts out at about $50,000 a year, reaching about $54,652 at year 12, according to Lake Travis school district records. Additionally, officials said, retail and restaurant workers average around $25,000 annually. And a Bee Cave police officer, with little to no experience, starts around $45,000 a year.
   
 City staff said there are not many affordable housing projects in the Bee Cave area. So most workers are commuting from outside Bee Cave. Police Chief Gary Miller said that out of the department's 19 officers, five live in apartments in Bee Cave, adding that the five work as security for the complex in exchange for reduced rent.
   
 There are a few affordable housing options west of MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) with the closest option being about seven miles down Texas 71 from Bee Cave in Southwest Austin. South and East Austin have several affordable housing options, meaning people could be commuting more than 25 miles to work each day.
   
 The goal
   
 Oskoui said the city is trying to make it possible for the many service industry and government workers who commute to the city daily to live in Bee Cave.
   
 "Business owners have said it is difficult for them to retain employees because of the limited housing options," she said. "We are also trying to attract traditional workforce housing people such as police officers, teachers, nurses and occupations of that nature to live here."
   
 The City Council gave approval to city staff to move forward on finding partnerships that can bring those options to Bee Cave to support the workers in government and service industry jobs.
   
 "It's gotten to be a huge problem, and with COVID-19 we can see how many people were in the service industry," said Council Member Andrea Willott. "I'm all for this. … Affordable housing is a huge industry and there are a lot of different ways to go about it. I don't know where we would do it here in Bee Cave, but I think we need to start thinking about it. I think there could be a perception problem in the community. This is not Section 8 housing. That is not what we're talking about."
   
 The City Council will make changes to its comprehensive plans, laying out these projects and goals in a future meeting.
