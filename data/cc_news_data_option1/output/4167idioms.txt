Luke Lu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Color Star, commented, "To organize or co-organize up to 30 music festivals with different genres over the next five years is one of the high-priority strategic initiatives for the Company. With the recovery of the China economy in full swing after the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for music festivals and concerts is strong and likely to continue in our view, making China as the first stop of the Series a logical choice for us. Our China team is currently working intensively on the first festival and we look forward to updating our fans, followers and users on the progress in coming weeks."

Hente said there is still a strong possibility that more businesses will be coming on board to participate in the project.

There are a lot of substantive comments to make about the two town halls. Trump held up well even though Savannah Guthrie was attacking him like a maddened chihuahua. Biden also held up well thanks to George Stephanopoulos's gentle handling and an increasing number of very long commercial breaks. (And was Biden fed the questions in advance? He seemed unusually prepared.) But the real star had to be the woman in the red mask sitting behind Trump. She nodded supportively every time he answered and shook her head every time the maddened chihuahua interrupted and interrogated him.

Adds Biden negative COVID-19 test)
 By Trevor Hunnicutt and Joseph Ax
 Oct 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will hold dueling prime-time town halls instead of a second presidential debate on Thursday, as Americans continued to swamp polling places in states allowing early in-person voting.
 With less than three weeks to go until Nov. 3's Election Day, the Republican president is trying to change the dynamics of a race in which Biden has a double-digit advantage in some national polls.
 North Carolina, a highly competitive state, began more than two weeks of in- person early voting on Thursday, following huge turnout in Georgia and Texas earlier in the week.
 Video from local media showed large numbers of people waiting for the polls to open in Greensboro and Winston-Salem, and gathering in the pre-dawn hours to vote at two arenas in the state's largest city, Charlotte.
 Gerry Cohen, a member of the election board in the county that includes most of the city of Raleigh, saw more than 400 people in line at a community center before polls opened.
 "I've never seen this many in line here," he said on Twitter.
 Nearly 18 million Americans have cast ballots either in person or by mail so far, representing 12.9% of the total votes counted in the 2016 general election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.
 Voters are seeking to avoid in-person lines on Election Day to stay safe as coronavirus infections and hospitalizations continue to rise, but also to make sure their ballots will count. Many are concerned that Trump will challenge widely used mail-in ballots, after he claimed without evidence that they were fraudulent.
 Trump's campaign is counting on a surge of last-minute votes. But Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted from Friday to Tuesday shows there are far fewer undecided likely voters this year - around 8% - and they are just as likely to pick Biden as they are Trump.
 Four years ago at this stage of the campaign, more than twice as many people were similarly wavering between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.
 The Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Biden holding a 10-percentage-point lead nationally, with a tighter margin in the battleground states that will help decide the election.
 $1.5 BILLION
 Democratic fundraising organization ActBlue said on Thursday it collected $1.5 billion online from July to September, the most it had ever raised in one quarter. By comparison, major Republican fundraising platform WinRed said on Monday that it collected $623.5 million in the same period.
 "We've raised more money than I ever thought we could," Biden told donors at an event.
 Both candidates have been visiting battleground states this week, with Trump holding rallies in Florida, Pennsylvania and Iowa and Biden traveling to Ohio and Florida.
 Speaking to a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Thursday, Trump promised an economic recovery if he was re-elected. "We're going to have a red wave," he said.
 The U.S. economy tanked in the second quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic, and at least 25 million people remained on jobless benefits at the end of September, Labor Department figures showed on Thursday.
 Trump pulled out of Thursday's scheduled debate when the commission in charge of organizing the event said it would be held virtually after he contracted the coronavirus. A final debate is still scheduled for Oct. 22 in Nashville, Tennessee.
 The town halls, in which each candidate will field questions from voters, will take place at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT), with Trump on NBC from Miami and Biden on ABC from Philadelphia.
 A group of 100 Hollywood actors and producers wrote a letter of protest to NBC, saying that airing Trump's town hall was "enabling the President's bad behavior while undercutting the Presidential Debate Commission and doing a disservice to the American public."
 The Biden campaign said on Thursday that two people involved in the campaign had tested positive for COVID-19, including one on the staff of Senator Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate.
 Biden had also been on a plane with an aviation company employee who tested positive but was not in close contact, his campaign said in a statement. He tested negative for COVID-19 on Thursday as well as Wednesday, his campaign said.
 While Harris was not in close contact with anyone who tested positive, the campaign said it was canceling Harris' travel until after Sunday as a precaution, although Biden's schedule will be unaffected.
 "This shows how seriously we take COVID, how we have since March done everything in our power as a campaign to ensure the safety of our staff and volunteers and voters," Biden's campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, told reporters on a call.

As he studied hard, he became a manager two months later and took the position as the head of finished product in the workshop six months later.

When you get dressed in the morning, what information do you need? First and foremost, you need to know what clothes are available to you in your closet. Then you might consider what the temperature is, what the weather forecast is for the day, what season it is and maybe some personal preferences.

In recent decades a few lone wolves migrated to Colorado from adjacent states, but were killed or simply disappeared. Then, starting in 2019, a pack of up to six wolves and a separate lone wolf were sighted in northern Colorado. Recent media reports indicate that some of these wolves may have been shot and killed along the Wyoming-Colorado border.

I wanted to understand the charge, so I approached Bathing Solutions and asked it for an itemised breakdown of materials and labour costs. This is a standard document for any tradesman to provide. Your relatives should have asked for this before they signed on the dotted line. Bathing Solutions refused my request.

It has been blindingly obvious to all and sundry for a while that South Africa (or at least a chunk of their rugby administration) see the North as the pathway for their future. They sent their lesser provinces there to play in the PRO14 a couple of seasons ago, and the recent news that the traditional Super Rugby Franchises would go there instead clearly shows their intent as a sport to head in that geographical direction.

So, an algorithm is the process a computer uses to transform input data into output data. A simple concept, and yet every piece of technology that you touch involves many algorithms.

He has turned up the series, got another different ball," Bond said in a video posted on Mumbai Indians' Twitter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        "When you are seeing it from a player, who is self-motivated, doing things in the background to make themselves better.

In my book "Conspiracy of Silence: Sportswriters and the Long Campaign to Desegregate Baseball," I argue that baseball's color line existed as long as it did because the nation's white mainstream sportswriters remained silent about it, even as Black and progressive activists campaigned for integration.

"It’s understandable people don’t want to see it, but it’s a problem we have in the community and we’re part of the community, so helping is the way to go about it, not trying to not see it," Maldonado said.

According to an article by Douglas Kent (“First Aid for Sonoma County’s Fire-Damaged Soil,” Santa Rosa Press Democrat, Oct. 27, 2017), “erosion leaps as high as 200 percent following fires in urbanized areas.” The slopes and vales that comprise our foothill and mountain areas mean that the immediate danger from water repellent soil comes in the form of flash flooding and the flow of debris and mud. Hydrophobia in burn-scarred soils makes them as water repellant as pavement, and the National Weather Service notes that it takes much less rainfall to cause a flash flood in post-fire landscapes. Their rule of thumb is “if you can look uphill from where you are and see a burned area, you are at risk.”

"You may have to bite the bullet and sacrifice that social gathering, unless you're pretty certain that the people that you're dealing with are not infected. Either they've been very recently tested, or they're living a lifestyle in which they don't have any interaction with anybody except you and your family," Fauci said this week during an interview with CBS News.

Judicial orders contravening a state legislature’s established procedures not only intrude on the legislature’s authority; they also blithely assume election officials will be able to do their jobs when faced with last minute procedural changes and performance expectations in the middle of a pandemic. Justice Brett Kavanaugh hit the nail on the head concurring in the Supreme Court’s recent order staying a South Carolina court’s order changing election procedures. Legislative decisions either to change or not change election procedures due to the coronavirus “should not be subject to second-guessing by an unelected federal judiciary, which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people.”

Republicans have been bracing themselves for this early Democratic advantage for months, as they've watched President Donald Trump rail against mail-in ballots and raise unfounded worries about fraud. Polling, and now early voting, suggest the rhetoric has turned his party's rank and file away from a method of voting that, traditionally, they dominated in the weeks before Election Day.

Still, at the end of the day it is basically a popularity contest and no disrespect to Mr. Franklin, but Kanye West is way more known outside of gospel circles so we're not surprised he was blessed with so many trophies last night. Given his celebrity and the attention that his Sunday Service has been getting for a while now, it makes sense that he'd win last night's popularity contest in this particular category.

The total dropping over 2 players, without benching is a refreshing thing in my book. Its a cut throat selection policy that needs to be re-instated. Coaching softness / loyalty got us nowhere under Cheika.

In my book "Conspiracy of Silence: Sportswriters and the Long Campaign to Desegregate Baseball," I argue that baseball's color line existed as long as it did because the nation's white mainstream sportswriters remained silent about it, even as Black and progressive activists campaigned for integration.

Getting dressed in active-wear as soon as you wake up really sets the tone for the rest of your day. This way, you can ensure you are able to get your workout in at some point in between your daily tasks. Feeling like you’re ready to work out at any point throughout your day will encourage you to do so.

Fact is, if today Christ himself came to the floor of Congress and repeated his teachings, many would malign him as a radical and eject him from the chamber,” posted Ocasio-Cortez.

Knowing how tough it is for able bodied, young men and women to make ends meet these days, made us realize that the elderly is very vulnerable. The rapid changes that urbanization brings have impacted many of the age-old safety nets and communal support systems which looked after the elderly in most traditional cultures of our country. This is a global phenomenon but other emergent societies have realized this and put structures in place to help the aged – e.g., subsidized housing, transportation, healthcare etc. The plight of the elderly in our country has been grossly neglected over the years by government. It is a fact that only a very small percentage of the population of the elderly receives pensions or has independent means of income. The vast majority are totally dependent on family or charity. Many of them are going through untold hardships and there is need to act on their behalf. Our NGO believes that old age is not punishment and is indeed the grace of God on the individual. The society and all communities should place the elderly in a position of value and comfort, not only that it is a destination every young person aspires to, but the society stands to reap the benefits of their cumulative experiences and mentorship. This was what motivated us to start this group.

Cristiano Ronaldo e al centro del caso "bolla bucata", con l'andata e ritorno da Torino per disputare le gare con il Portogallo. CR7 ha lasciato la bolla bianconera con qualche giorno d'anticipo per rispondere alla chiamata del Ct, salvo poi dover chiudere anticipatamente la spedizione nazionale proprio per aver contratto il coronavirus. E' tornato a Torino per il suo isolamento, con un volo privato autorizzato dalle autorita sanitarie. Quanto e costato? Tuttosport racconta: "I 15-20mila euro che piu o meno ha speso per il volo in aeroambulanza sono poco cosa per le sue tasche".

Either they've been very recently tested, or they're living a lifestyle in which they don't have any interaction with anybody except you and your family," Fauci said this week during an interview with CBS News.

Tra i pittori muralisti, che negli anni trenta vollero far rivivere l'arte italiana dell'affresco monumentale, oltre a Sironi che fu promotore del manifesto del 1933, furono Cagli, Campigli, Carra, e Achille Funi (1890 - 1972). Quest'ultimo fu frescante prodigioso per qualita e quantita, a Roma, Milano, Bergamo, Ferrara e Tripoli di Libia. Di Funi sono in mostra un cartone per la sala virgiliana della Triennale di Monza del 1930, con Didone e Anna, e due cartoni di Legionari Romani eseguiti per il Martirio di S. Giorgio per la chiesa di questo nome in via Torino a Milano. Oltre a questi vi sono il dipinto Venere Latina, ovvero Il nudo e le Sculture, del 1930, statua che si fa carne, sogno di Pigmalione realizzato ad olio. Di Funi ancora oltre ad una Lucrezia romana a olio, classica e tizianesca insieme, vi e infine un pannello monumentale dipinto a tempera su fondo oro, lungo quasi cinque metri, che egli fino alla morte tenne nell'aula di Brera dove insegnava tecnica dell'affresco: si tratta de Il Parnaso, con Apollo e le nove Muse, che ha l'aria d'una miniatura rinascimentale ingigantita o d'una pittura parietale pompeiana dipinta su stagnola dorata, come il coperchio di una ciclopica scatola di cioccolatini.

Bob Rock, the (unbeatably-named) producer responsible for Mötley Crüe’s finest moments, oversees a cover version of the Prince song When You Were Mine.

  TOKYO, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Japan's new leader will aim to beef up security ties when he visits Vietnam and Indonesia next week amid concerns about Beijing's growing assertiveness, but is likely to steer clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by U.S. counterparts.


  Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, whose resume is scant on diplomatic experience, will follow in predecessor Shinzo Abe's footsteps by making the two Southeast Asian nations the destination for his first overseas trip since taking office in September.


  "I think it is important to show ... we put more emphasis and importance on that region and we are interested in the security situation, especially in the South China Sea," said former diplomat Kunihiko Miyake, a special advisor to Suga.


  Suga is expected to visit Vietnam, chair of the 10-member ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), and Indonesia, its biggest economy, on a four-day trip from Sunday.


  Japan must balance its deep economic ties with China with security concerns, including Beijing's push to assert claims over disputed East China Sea isles. Abe oversaw an improvement in ties but some ruling party MPs want a tougher stance.


  ASEAN members, many of which have territorial feuds with China in vital South China Sea waterways, are wary of alienating a big economic partner and reluctant to become entrapped in an intense confrontation between the United States and China.


  Scott Harold, associate director at the Rand Corporation's Center for Asia- Pacific Policy, said Japan's approach is to be firm, calm and advance its interests without asking countries to explicitly push back against China.


  Beefing up defence cooperation will be a "key point" of Suga's trip to Vietnam following last week's port call of three Japanese vessels at the country's Cam Ranh naval base, said Ha Hoang Hop of the Singapore-based ISEAS- Yusof Ishak Institute.


  China claims swathes of Vietnam's exclusive economic zone as well as the Paracel and Spratly Islands while Indonesia has been angered by Chinese coast guard intrusions into its exclusive economic zone off its Natuna Islands.


  Japan plans to sign an agreement with Vietnam to allow it to export defence equipment and technology to the country, the Nikkei newspaper reported this week. A Japanese official said Japan was talking about enhancing defense cooperation with both Hanoi and Jakarta but could not comment on the outcomes.


  Suga's trip follows last week's Tokyo meeting of the "Quad", an informal grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, which Washington sees as a bulwark against China.


  Beijing has denounced the Quad as a "mini-NATO" meant to contain China.


  Hop said Vietnam could endorse the Quad as the group becomes more inclusive and as Beijing becomes more aggressive in South China Sea. Indonesia, however, is wary.


  "Indonesia, which puts a high primacy on ASEAN's centrality, is going to be very ambivalent about the Quad because it undermines that whole principle ... They are unlikely to jump on the quad bandwagon," said Euan Graham at the Singapore-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.


  Suga's visit also coincides with Japan's efforts to diversify its supply chains and reduce reliance on China by bringing production home or locating more in Southeast Asia.


  He will likely announce an expansion of Japan's subsidies for production in Southeast Asia on his trip, the Nikkei said.


  Vietnam is a popular choice for Japanese firms. Half of the 30 Japanese firms that took advantage of a 23.5 billion yen government scheme to diversify supply chains in Southeast Asia targeted Vietnam, which has aggressively courted Japanese investment.


  Only one opted for Indonesia, where Japanese firms complain about a sometimes arbitrary regulatory environment, prompting Tokyo to call for improvements.

They then ran off; a Good Samaritan tried to follow them, police said, but the suspects fired shots at him.

In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of OPDIVO to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.

However, SpaceX is not alone in pushing to launch large numbers of internet satellites. OneWeb has already launched 74 satellites for its planned constellation of 48,000, and Amazon aims to launch more than 3,200 for its Kuiper fleet. It's unclear how many dead satellites those constellations might also leave in orbit.
 Since nobody can maneuver them, failed satellites sometimes hurtle toward other spacecraft -- including the International Space Station and its crew of astronauts.
 Even if a satellite crashes into another satellite with no humans on board, it can create perilous conditions.

Anglers can use invasive carp as bait if the fish are dead. It is recommended that netted bait fish be placed on ice.

Sacking Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is “not the way to go” for Manchester United, says Louis Saha, with the Red Devils urged to show a little patience in a manager who has shown that he can deliver results.

It asserts that gray wolves are endangered in Colorado; were historically an essential part of Colorado's wildlands, but were exterminated by humans; and will help restore ecological balance if they are reintroduced.

In April, Andrew Yang, then a Democratic presidential candidate, sued the New York State Board of Elections after it effectively canceled the Democratic presidential primary. He argued that doing so was illegal since he already had met the requirements for having his name to appear on the ballot. One month after the suit was filed, a judge agreed with Yang and ordered the state to proceed with its presidential primary.

This time the target is the publication of the salaries of local government employees. A bill changing state law so that those no longer have to be published is in the works. A committee passed it in September.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As it stands now, our taxpayer-funded municipal governments, county governments and public school districts must, at the very least, publish a list of positions and how much the people who hold them are paid. In some cases the actual names of the job holders must be published as well.

This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and by the use of forward-looking words such as "expect," "expectation," "believe," "anticipate," "may," "could," "intend," "belief," "plan," "estimate," "target," "predict," "likely," "will," "should," "forecast," "outlook," "look forward to" or similar terminology. These statements are based on current estimates and assumptions made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, but there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our future digital strategies, business plans and investment plans. Forward- looking statements are not guaranteeing of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or assumptions will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are only made as of the date of this press release, and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward- looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by law. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. You should consult our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including the information set forth under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations " in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC) for additional detail about factors that could affect our financial and other results.

Hoda Kotb reveals Frank Sinatra Jr. was the 'worst celebrity guest we've ever had, bar none' on the Today Show: 'He didn't want to talk about his book, so he didn't say anything'

“It was a fun time, and it’ll never be like that again,” Lee says. “It was before Instagram and cellphones, so we could get away with murder without anybody knowing about it. We got into a whole lot of stuff. Anything went. There were no consequences. Excess seemed to be just a daily thing. It was just a f-----g wild time.”

With much revelry off the agenda, at least for the time being, the prospect of a party season with very few parties in it could potentially be devastating for brands. John Lewis & Partners, however, has released its annual 12 Days of Christmas Dressing campaign - with a 2020-proof twist.

Your column is a STRETCH!! When one party, the Democrats, will stop at nothing to gain power, that is Socialism or Communism. With a Harris / Biden win with total gov't control, there will be court packing, medicare for all including illegal aliens, citizenship for all illegal aliens for about 12 million more Dem. votes, open borders, statehood for Puerto Rico & DC to add more Dem. votes to the Senate & House and total EXTINCTION of the Republican Party!

So, an algorithm is the process a computer uses to transform input data into output data. A simple concept, and yet every piece of technology that you touch involves many algorithms. Maybe the next time you grab your phone, see a Hollywood movie or check your email, you can ponder what sort of complex set of algorithms is behind the scenes.

The three-tier system probably sounded like a good idea at the time, but if pretty much everywhere is going to have tiers 2 or 3 imposed, then we might as well accept that we are already facing a second national lockdown and get on with it. But such an admission would be unwelcome in the Treasury, which is panicking about the amounts already committed to helping out workers furloughed from their jobs during the spring and summer. Local restrictions that fall short, by however little, of full lockdown allow mandarins to withhold financial aid on the basis that circumstances are different from what we faced in March. Which explains Andy Burnham’s impressive campaign to secure more help for his city region by opposing tougher restrictions (and doesn’t go anywhere near explaining Khan’s eagerness to shut his citizens in their houses and throw away the key until the New Year).

City officials, including the mayor and police chief, not only manufactured a criminal charge, they did everything they could to ensure that Gonzalez spent the day in jail. Among other tactics, they circumvented the county's district attorney and secured an arrest warrant instead of a summons. Both procedures would have allowed Gonzalez to appear before a judge, but a summons -- the normal process for dealing with nonviolent misdemeanors -- would have eliminated the need to be processed and put behind bars.

McGlinchey called criticism of him and the 49ers' linemen "over the top," that it is a "lazy narrative of one play or two, and (critics) see something on Twitter and think they have it figured out."

Then you might consider what the temperature is, what the weather forecast is for the day, what season it is and maybe some personal preferences.

In addition to the hit advance released songs, _Nectar_ harbours other impressive tracks that offer a lot to the listener. The first two tracks on the album, ‘Ew’ and ‘Modus’ contain emotionally potent lyrics and layered instrumentals that immediately capture attention. Furthermore, the interlude ‘Upgrade’, which exhibits a simplistic broken piano beat, and the raw yet powerful ‘Mr. Hollywood’, would remind long-time Joji fans of _Chloe Burbank Vol 1_ , which even outdates his first official ep _In Tongues_ (2017).‘Pretty Boy’ deviates from the consistent sound of the album by providing a melancholic tone that surprisingly seems to oscillate between being both happy and sad, whilst also having an impressive feature from Lil Yachty that boosts the track and breaks up the songs flow in a very tasteful way. The impressive features list that _Nectar_ boasts only adds to the album and confirms Joji’s rising prominence in the music industry, with distinguished artists such as Diplo and BENEE making good appearances. Lastly, ‘Your Man’ makes for a triumphant and heavily pop-orientated final track that should leave both new and returning listeners alike eager for more from Joji.

Talking to the BBC after her win, Swiatak admitted that she's still trying to get to grips with her newfound fame, especially back home in Poland, where she has become a national sporting superstar as the nation's first Grand Slam champion.

“After the curtailed season last year, ski companies are going to have to dig deep to find a way to keep their companies going for when things pick up again. Skiers are desperate to return to the slopes, most of which will be fully open from December.

In April, Andrew Yang, then a Democratic presidential candidate, sued the New York State Board of Elections after it effectively canceled the Democratic presidential primary. He argued that doing so was illegal since he already had met the requirements for having his name to appear on the ballot. One month after the suit was filed, a judge agreed with Yang and ordered the state to proceed with its presidential primary.

When it’s not a priority, you’ll always find excuses not to do it. Come to an agreement with yourself on your intentions behind staying fit. You might be doing it to feel stronger, to shed a couple pounds, to feel energized, or just to feel good! Whatever reason you have, constantly remind yourself of it and prioritise it every day. The power of intentions will keep you on track in the long run even on days where you slightly stray from the path of your wellbeing journey.

Proposition 114 was placed on the ballot through a citizen initiative led by the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund.

Now the 74-year- old retiree is fighting back, trying to bring accountability to a system that too often lets public officials off the hook when they violate people's civil rights.

In my book "Conspiracy of Silence: Sportswriters and the Long Campaign to Desegregate Baseball," I argue that baseball's color line existed as long as it did because the nation's white mainstream sportswriters remained silent about it, even as Black and progressive activists campaigned for integration.

WandaVision will soon be on Disney Plus, yet we still barely know anything about the mysterious series other than it will see the eponymous duo – Wanda Maximoff (AKA Scarlet Witch) and Vision – travelling through time and (maybe) universes. As a result, the pair will eventually bump into Monica Rambeau, who was last seen as a child in Captain Marvel played by Akira Akbar.


  Rambeau's return, however, will be a little different, as Teyonah Parris will play a grown-up version of the character in WandaVision. In an interview with The Undefeated, Parriss spoke about the role, saying (via ComicBook.com): "Monica Rambeau, she’s such a badass in the comics. I just can’t believe that this is happening. This is full-on action movie, mixed with sitcoms, it’s wild. It’s wild. I think people will be very excited."


  The actor also detailed how the role was a "childhood dream" come true. "I’ve always said that, 'I want to be a superhero.’ Then, when the MCU opened up, I think I was in college. It was like I want to be a Marvel superhero,” she said. “I went to see Iron Man, and seeing women in those movies kick ass. I watched those movies and said, 'I want to do that.’


  "I didn’t know how or why because Black women are not afforded that opportunity. Most of the women I was watching weren’t Black. I was like sure, whatever that’s not going to happen. And then it happened. When I tell you that it wasn’t on my radar at that moment… I’m so happy to be a part of this universe."


  How exactly Rambeau will become involved with the timey-wimey shenanigans of WandaVision remains unknown. In the comics, the character becomes the next Captain Marvel – perhaps there are big things in store in the MCU for Parriss' character? We probably won't be seeing Brie Larson's superhero go anywhere anytime soon, but a multiverse with two Captain Marvels could be quite fun.


  WandaVision does not currently have a release date, though we expect to see the series on Disney Plus this November or December. In the meantime, be sure to check out all the best shows on Disney Plus.

Everybody has been adjusting on the fly during 2020. As we look ahead to 2021, Adam Lutostanski (Head of Illinois Commercial Banking at Associated Bank) joined Steve Grzanich to share the advice he is giving CEO's who are setting their budget for next year, and whether month-to-month plans will be the norm. Adam also comments on the services and manufacturing sectors, quarterly earning reports from big banks and the way it reflects on how consumers are doing.

In recent decades a few lone wolves migrated to Colorado from adjacent states, but were killed or simply disappeared. Then, starting in 2019, a pack of up to six wolves and a separate lone wolf were sighted in northern Colorado. Recent media reports indicate that some of these wolves may have been shot and killed along the Wyoming-Colorado border.

In my book "Conspiracy of Silence: Sportswriters and the Long Campaign to Desegregate Baseball," I argue that baseball's color line existed as long as it did because the nation's white mainstream sportswriters remained silent about it, even as Black and progressive activists campaigned for integration.

When interviewed about the operational impact of the COVID-19 crisis, Rashmin Abhani, Senior Technical Manager at iKO Media Group, commented, "DataMiner helped us to keep our operations up and running even with a very limited number of people on site. As the platform is providing us in-depth and end-to-end monitoring and control at our teleport and remote facilities, it was possible to keep the complete operation going with just a single on-site person. We experienced no operational impact at all. Using DataMiner, we can manage our system resources across multiple countries, across all products and software systems from many vendors, and across many technology domains, from a single user interface in a secured manner.

In my book "Conspiracy of Silence: Sportswriters and the Long Campaign to Desegregate Baseball," I argue that baseball's color line existed as long as it did because the nation's white mainstream sportswriters remained silent about it, even as Black and progressive activists campaigned for integration.

It's not just a matter of getting boats back in the water. All three cruise lines are going to have to dig deep into their coffers to woo passengers again, so this is not a good time to be small fry. If a shakeout does happen, Norwegian would be the most likely to feel the pinch.

Fatima had been experiencing bouts of urinary problems from a young age. She would have difficulty emptying her bladder, which caused her a great deal of discomfort and embarrassment. And to pass urine, she had to rely on a catheter, a solution that caused her deep distress. “I had been living with this problem on and off for years. I had tried medications and other therapies, but nothing worked. It was so stressful to live with a problem like this and trying to live a normal life, especially since I didn’t like to discuss it. I avoided going out too much and couldn’t visit the beach or [do] anything like that,” she said.

MEP stood no chance in the elections. Realising that defeat was a foregone conclusion, Nowhera resorted to trickery and deception. She tried to influence large sections of illiterate voters by citing a Satellite Political Survey (SAS) which claimed that MEP would emerge as the second largest party after the votes had been counted.

How could a satellite predict election results?

Supporters call it a democratic way to ensure that the public's values are recognized. They also argue that voters are deciding only whether wolves should be reintroduced, while allowing experts at the state wildlife agency to create a reintroduction plan based on the best available science.

Knowing exactly how big the battery is inside a device isn't necessarily relevant. It's really a combination of hardware and software that will determine energy efficiency and battery life. But RAM might be important for some buyers. And it turns out that the iPhone 12 Pro will have 6GB of RAM, just as we had suspected all along.

Somehow, what a naturally aspirated V8 packed in behind you is supposed to offer just doesn't translate to a kick in the back of the head (the good kind) when you really put your foot down. Rather, it feels a little sluggish at low revs.
 As a base model, though, it's clear that Chevrolet left room for what's coming next. It's the only explanation for all the tameness. The upcoming performance versions will build on what the C8 already offers, and will likely surpass what they were in the C7 generation when they put down 650 horsepower and 755 horsepower.
 I'm speculating, but I wouldn't be surprised if in two or three years we find ourselves with a 1,000-horsepower, hybrid, mid-engined Corvette for the C8 generation.

Now, Orbea has launched a whole new line of these puppies, and this is the Gain M10i, the most expensive from the lineup as well, coming in at 9,299 US dollars (7,940 Euro at the time of writing this article). Just so we're on the same page, the entire frame is a monocoque carbon frame with internal cable routing. To top it all off, the fork is full carbon too, adding more insult to injury when referring to weight.

According to a tracking site for colleges in the New England Small College Athletic Association, Colby College in Waterville also had a recent positive test. Colby has had a dozen cases this semester while Bowdoin College has had four, the same as Bates.

Many factors could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

For example, the left-wing New York Times' recent release of President Donald Trump's tax records -- allegedly obtained from hacked and/or unauthorized sources -- was not blocked by Facebook or Twitter. The same is true with the secret recordings of first lady Melania Trump that were deceptively distributed by a former aide yet given free rein by the same networks. Twitter and Facebook allow the hashtag #MelaniaTapes to trend without incident.

When you get dressed in the morning, what information do you need? First and foremost, you need to know what clothes are available to you in your closet. Then you might consider what the temperature is, what the weather forecast is for the day, what season it is and maybe some personal preferences.

Released in 1989, the career-defining album Dr Feelgood sold seven million copies, in what would prove to be the last hurrah of the Hollywood scene. It was nice while it lasted, but an extinction event was coming.

McDonald’s does plan to add apple fritters, blueberry muffins and cinnamon rolls at all hours starting Oct. 28, because those items don’t take much attention in its kitchens. “I think it is a safe bet that you're going to see us add items back to the menu,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company’s second-quarter conference call. “I think it's also equally a safe bet that we're not going to go all the way back to where we were.” And third-quarter comparable sales rose 4.6%, nearly as much as they rose a year earlier, even without all-day breakfast.

Practice squad promotions Datone Jones and Chris Smith had their moments.

More than 2,000 took their own lives, including some 1,500 awaiting trial or indictment. A growing number — more than 1 in 10 last year — died from the acute effects of drugs and alcohol. Nearly 300 died after languishing behind bars, unconvicted, for a year or more.

On the Rocks review: "Bill Murray essays pure, distilled Murray-ness"


--DocBreak--
The NYP doesn’t extrapolate that out to Joe, and for good reason. Even if this was on the level, a scheme like this would be unlikely to involve a man who might have to fill out financial disclosures and who was already making a fetish of releasing tax returns. The “big guy” was likely someone else, if this is real in the first place.

Secondo la Ong "Peace Now", sono oltre 12 mila le unita abitative in Cisgiordania che sono state approvate nel 2020, segnando un record da quando l'Ong ha cominciato a tenerne il conto nel 2012.

Big thanks to @ladbible for writing this story. 🙌🏻 . . So last week I bought the bank building where I got knocked back for a loan at 21 years old! 🙌🏻😂 . . So when I was a broke ass 21 year old I had a dream to work for myself and setup my own business! 👍🏻 . . I created a business plan, made an appointment with the bank manager to speak about setting up and account and getting a business loan, before I went into the bank I prayed as I had zero cash and had no idea how I would realise my dream without it. 💯 . . I sat down with my fingers and toes crossed and the woman who was the bank manager took my business plan went through it quickly and in a really patronisingly tone said the problem is Adam you are a bit young and you have no business experience. This isn’t something we can do at this stage. 🤦🏻‍♂️😫 . . My heart sank, I felt humiliated, frustrated and sad. I had no plan B. 💔 😢 . . I had already quit my job and had managed to scrape enough money together to pay the first quarters rent and I got a phone-line off BT which was on 30 days credit terms. . . I didn’t have any money to buy a desk or chair so as a result I spent 4 months on the floor with the phone off BT and the Thompson Local. 😊 . . No marketing budget, no Google or Social media to even advertise in, just a burning desire to succeed! 🔥 . . So I bought the bank building where they declined me for the £10K business loan! 🙌🏻 . . For me this was a great day! 🤩 . .

With compliments still pouring in, Swasika is on cloud nine. “Until the winners were announced we had no expectations for the film, let alone an award for me. I was thrown off balance when my name was announced. It seems unreal,” says Swasika.

C’è poi un altro filone dell’indagine in cui compare l’ex assessore della giunta Fassino, Enzo Lavolta, al quale è contestato il reato di turbativa d’asta relativamente all’organizzazione del Terzo Forum Mondiale dello sviluppo economico locale, ospitato a Torino nell’ottobre del 2015. Gli inquirenti sospettano che, a partire dall’appalto gestito da Turismo Torino per l’allestimento del tendone in piazza Castello, Lavolta avrebbe favorito Parcolimpico a discapito di Gl Events. Secondo i magistrati, anche in questo frangente è coinvolto l’ex senatore Si Tav Esposito.

When you get dressed in the morning, what information do you need? First and foremost, you need to know what clothes are available to you in your closet. Then you might consider what the temperature is, what the weather forecast is for the day, what season it is and maybe some personal preferences.

Wimbledon is set to go ahead next year even if the tournament has to be staged behind closed doors.

Proposition 114 was placed on the ballot through a citizen initiative led by the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund. It asserts that gray wolves are endangered in Colorado; were historically an essential part of Colorado's wildlands, but were exterminated by humans; and will help restore ecological balance if they are reintroduced.

If the measure is upheld, it could lead to a trickle-down effect of the state charging exorbitant “tax-like” fees for the use of other public properties such as rights of way, shipping ports and water, the association argued in its court filings.

Who’s up for yet another story about the indoctrination of our youth in the nation’s public schools? This tale comes to us from O’Maley Middle School in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and while still disturbing, it at least has something of a happy ending. 12-year-old Jackson Cody is a typical 7th grader who attends this school and his class is somehow being allowed to attend school in person. Recently, after the first presidential debate, one of Jackson’s teachers scheduled a classroom exercise where the students would discuss the debate and what they thought of it. That’s when things took a turn for the worse. Jackson made the “mistake” of saying that he was impressed with how President Trump did and his performance in office. The response from the teacher was less than open and welcoming, to say the least. (CBS Boston)

"Regis was a great broadcaster, a good friend and a tremendous amount of fun," Kimmel wrote on Twitter at the time. "He leaves behind a beautiful family and a TV legacy that will likely go unmatched. Regis, I hope our friend Rickles met you at the pearly gates with open arms and a slew of the insults you loved so much."

The board put a lot of thought and deliberation into this decision, but wants to do their part in keeping Atchison County safe.

In recent decades a few lone wolves migrated to Colorado from adjacent states, but were killed or simply disappeared. Then, starting in 2019, a pack of up to six wolves and a separate lone wolf were sighted in northern Colorado. Recent media reports indicate that some of these wolves may have been shot and killed along the Wyoming-Colorado border.

That's because the new Corvette _is_ exciting, and it's a seismic shift from any other Corvette in history. America's Sports Car has finally landed in the form of the mid-engine supercar -- an idea that's been in the works since the late 1950s, but never actually came to be.
 That is, until now.
 The mid-engine Corvette is no longer a myth, no longer a tall tale. This is the real thing, designed to go toe-to-toe against the other midship sports cars and supercars that command much, much higher price tags.

First off is the entry-level Standard Range whose battery used to cover a maximum distance of 250 miles (402 km). The 2021 version, though, will add 13 more miles for a total of 263 (423 km). Going further up the price ladder is the Long Range Dual Motor AWD. This version not only gets an impressive 353 miles (568 km) of maximum range now (up from 322 miles/518 km), but its 0-60 mph (0-97 km/h) acceleration has also been cut short by 0.2 seconds to 4.2 seconds.

May be, it will see the resurgence of Karthik the busy finisher as we know him!

Wimbledon will have been closely watching the recent US Open, played behind closed doors, and the French Open, where 1,000 fans a day were eventually admitted, down from a hoped-for 11,500.

Rutger, in jou verbeelding als Hammie-fanboy misschien, maar volgens mij heeft Max precies een keer gevraagd of hij ook geen nieuwe banden had kunen krijgen. En daarna heeft hij gevochten op die oude banden. Maar toen Ham hem bijhaalde wist hij dat hij een sitting duck was. Hij heeft zichzelf nieteens beklaagd toen Ric hem als achterblijver in de weg zat (waar Ric zich na de race meteen aan Max voor verontschludigde) toen Ham de laatste 100en meters kon dichtrijden naar Max. Wat mij vooral nog bijstaat is de glimtach op zowel het gezicht van Ham als Max. Allebei tevreden met de mooie strijd die er geleverd was.

In Crete, where 55 percent of islanders are employed in the tourism industry and social welfare is extremely limited, seasonal workers have been badly affected by the closures. “When we finally opened in July, I advertised a job in our hotel and I received more than 280 CVs in two days. I had to take the phone off the hook because people were calling and begging me to give them the job – it was heartbreaking,” says Vicky Maltabe, human resources manager at luxury Cretan resort Stella Island.

The use of "the Biden crime family" is no mere hyperbole.  Before Rudy Giuliani was "America's Mayor," he was one of America's top prosecutors, which included bringing down mafia crime families.  And he has evidence -- from Hunter -- that implicates not only Hunter and Joe Biden, but also James (Joe's brother) and Sara (James's wife).  One set of payments from China went to a triad of Bidens: James, Hunter, and Sara.  Don't worry, Giuliani says -- you're going to see it in the texts, not making it up.

"I have enjoyed a unique and very special relationship with Air Canada and our outstanding people for over three decades, on the front lines of many of the company's defining moments - the 1988-1989 privatization, the defence against a hostile bid for Air Canada in 1999, our merger with Canadian Airlines in 2000, the aftermath of 9-11, leading the 2003-2004 restructuring and many others. But, more than anything else in my career, I am especially proud of the company's transformation over the last dozen years during which we built Air Canada into one of the world's leading carriers and a global champion for Canada, winning international customer and employee awards, growing our global network to serve all six inhabited continents, creating thousands of jobs and protecting pensions, producing record financial results, strengthening our balance sheet dramatically, delivering significant shareholder value, and above all, developing a lasting, empowered and entrepreneurial culture for our airline. This is directly attributable to the efforts of the wonderful women and men of Air Canada who have supported this multi-year transformation with innovation, hard work and great devotion," said Mr. Rovinescu.


  "While Covid-19 has decimated the global airline industry, fortunately we entered the pandemic much healthier than almost any other airline in the world as a result of our strong balance sheet, track record and engaged workforce. Our Covid-19 Mitigation and Recovery Plan is now nearly complete and the remaining steps will be put in place prior to year-end. We have raised around $6 billion of incremental liquidity. We continue to implement a series of significant fleet, capacity, network and workforce reductions that are required for the next several years before we rebuild from that smaller footprint. We have reduced our cost structure, our capital spending and our supplier arrangements for the next years. At the same time, we have completed the implementation of our new Reservation System and our acquisition of Aeroplan and we will have launched our new industry-leading loyalty program. We have concluded a revised Acquisition Agreement for Transat AT, a leader in leisure travel, subject to regulatory approval. Air Canada will be extremely well positioned for the recovery when borders reopen, travel restrictions are lifted and the broader economy is functioning again," added Mr. Rovinescu


  "Mike Rousseau has been a key member of our leadership team since the beginning of our transformation, as well as an invaluable partner and sounding board for me on virtually all aspects of our journey over the last 12 years - and especially the last two as our Deputy CEO," said Mr. Rovinescu. "He knows all of our strengths and opportunities and how we can lean into them. I am truly delighted that the Board of Directors has endorsed Mike as my successor for this next stage and I look forward to working closely with Mike and the rest of our strong executive team through the transition next February."


  "Calin's record in successfully transforming Air Canada into a sustainable, global aviation industry leader is directly attributable to his strategic leadership and unflappable courage to make difficult and innovative decisions, always keeping the best interest of all stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers and partners, at the forefront. Under his leadership, Skytrax has named Air Canada The Best Airline in North America eight times in the last 10 years while The Globe and Mail reported that Air Canada was the best performing stock on the TSX, in all industrial categories, over the decade ending December 31, 2019, with a total shareholder return exceeding 3600%. His leadership also resulted in the creation of the Air Canada Foundation, whose mission is focused on children and youth in Canada and abroad and which supports some 300 charitable organizations, in addition to providing humanitarian relief for natural disasters around the world. On behalf of the Air Canada Board of Directors, I sincerely thank Calin for his incredible contribution to Air Canada, a contribution that will bear fruit for years to come. The Board looks forward to working with Mike Rousseau, whose leadership role has evolved well beyond that of a traditional CFO over his time at Air Canada. His financial and commercial acumen, as well as his team- oriented nature will serve the Company well in the years ahead," said Vagn Sorensen, Chair of the Board of Directors of Air Canada.


  Mr. Rovinescu has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada since April 1, 2009, having previously served as its Executive Vice President, Corporate Development & Strategy and as its Chief Restructuring Officer. Mr. Rovinescu was Chair of the Star Alliance Chief Executive Board from 2012-2016 and served as Chair of the Board of Governors of the International Air Transport Association in 2014-2015.


  In 2019, Mr. Rovinescu was recognized as Strategist of the Year and as Canada's Outstanding CEO of the Year for the second time by The Globe and Mail's Report on Business magazine. In 2016, Mr. Rovinescu was recognized as Canada's Outstanding CEO of the Year by the Financial Post Magazine, Canada's preeminent recognition for chief executives. Among several airline industry recognitions, he was awarded the Executive Leadership Award at the 2018 Airline Strategy Awards in London, England.


  In 2018, Mr. Rovinescu was appointed a member of the Order of Canada for promoting the associated charitable causes and organizations of Canada's largest airline, and for his leadership in spearheading humanitarian relief following several natural disasters. In 2019 it was announced that he would be inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame.


  Mr. Rousseau has served as Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Air Canada since December 2018, having previously served as its Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer since 2007.


  Mr. Rousseau played an instrumental role in Air Canada's transformation, notably by leading the charge on strengthening the balance sheet, building significant shareholder value and the complete turnaround and stabilization of Air Canada's pension plans. He has led many areas of Air Canada's business, having had oversight of Air Canada Rouge, fleet planning, treasury, corporate real estate, procurement, cost transformation, mergers and acquisitions, investor relations and pension fund administration.


  Prior to joining Air Canada, Mr. Rousseau was President of Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) and before that, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of HBC. Mr. Rousseau is a Fellow Chartered Accountant and graduated from York University's Schulich School of Business with a Business Administration degree. He was named Canada's CFO of the year in 2017 and holds the prestigious FCA and FCPA designations conferred by CPA Ontario in recognition of his professional achievements.

For the All Blacks, there has been speculation all week about the fitness of a few different players. Richie Mo'unga was under a cloud as was Beauden Barrett, resulting in Josh Ioane being called in early in the week.

PEMBROKE -- Incumbent Josh Cutler will face off against Republican candidate Tatyana Semyrog for state representative of the 6th Plymouth District in the Nov. 3 general election.


  The 6th Plymouth District includes the towns of Pembroke, Duxbury and Hanson.


  Cutler, a 49-year-old Democrat, has held the seat for four terms. He co- sponsored the Energy Savings and Efficiency Act (Energy SAVE), and led the successful effort to restore weekend commuter rail service to the South Shore.


  "I'm running for re-election (because) I want to continue to use my experience to help solve problems and make sure that our district continues to be a great place to live, work, and raise a family," Cutler said.


  Looking toward a potential fifth term, Cutler said he is focused on renewable energy, climate change, economic development and education. He said he wants to focus on bringing local aid to his district, and previously helped pass the Student Opportunity Act, which will provide funding to school districts to address disparities in achievement.


  Cutler also said he is focused on supporting small businesses, especially in light of COVID-19.


  "We need to focus on our economic recovery and helping all businesses, but especially our small businesses that need help the most," Cutler said.


  Semyrog did not respond to email, phone or social media attempts to contact her for this story, but did participate Monday in a candidate forum hosted by radio station WATD.


  In the forum, Semyrog touched on oppression she experienced in her birth country, the former Soviet Union, and said she now sees similar behavior in the United States with the "labeling, bullying, debasing, marginalizing, and ostracizing" of people who do not agree with "the left."


  Cutler said the role of a state representative is three-fold, but most importantly it requires one to provide constituent service. He said that is especially important because of the pandemic as people navigate unemployment and financial assistance for their small businesses. The other two roles, he said, are fighting for the district's share of state resources and being a leader on issues of importance to the district as well as the state.


  "I think I have a track record I think of getting things done, of being a voice for my district, I mean I can give you a litany of examples," Cutler said. "I'm comfortable [with] people judging me on my record and I hope that they will and I think if they look at that they'll see that I've done a fair job and I work hard and I've been an effective voice for our district."


  Semyrog said that her name has been "dragged through the mud and smeared," and that she has not received an apology from Cutler for what Semyrog says are attacks on her heritage, past, and character.


  "I am running to stand up against this oppression, to give people hope and courage," Semyrog said during the WATD candidates forum. "Our freedoms are under attack by the kind of socialist agenda my opponent has been voting for. His votes to defund our police, increase our gas tax, all while voting twice to increase his pay speak of a radical leftist who has no businesses representing this district."


  In response, Cutler said that he supports policing reform, such as the licensing and certification of police officers, but does not support "defunding the police," which refers to the reallocation of funds from police departments to other priority areas. Additionally, he said that the gas tax has decreased by 40% since he took office, although he did vote in support of the March tax bill.


  Semyrog was recently criticized on social media over comments she appears to have made under her maiden name on the blog shoebat.com. The comments, which are now deleted, addressed the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.


  She responded to the attacks with a post on her personal blog, where she said she is not able to recall much of the time period during which those comments were made due to her cancer diagnosis and death of her husband.


  "I don't recognize any of those words as ever have been written by me because I simply have no memory of such," Semyrog wrote in the blog post.


  Cutler currently resides in Pembroke with his wife and two children.


  Semyrog is a resident of Duxbury where she lives with her three children.


  Voters in Massachusetts have until Oct. 24 to register to vote in the Nov. 3 primary and until Oct. 28 to request a mail-in ballot. Early voting will take place from Oct. 17 to Oct. 30.


  Registration can be done by mail or online at sec.state.ma.us/ovr.

But the lies go much deeper than that. First, the notion that a Justice Barrett is certain to vote to overturn all of Obamacare is false. Biden simply made up the claim that she “wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.” What Barrett has said was that Chief Justice John Roberts shouldn’t have rewritten the statute to turn the individual insurance mandate penalty (which most of the justices viewed as unconstitutional) into a tax penalty.

"In addition to the bilingual child care services, the center offers services from the Dominican Republic's consulate so that people can get their Dominican ID cards and cast absentee ballots for the Dominican Republic's general elections. They no longer have to go all the way to New York City to make these arrangements. You can call the Centro Cívico for more information at (518) 465-1145," Pereyra explains.

De acordo com o delegado Rodolfo Carlos de Oliveira, que está a frente das investigações, a motivação do crime contra Rovida seria uma vingança em função do assassinato de Fábio Nascimento dos Santos, o 'Tripinha', de 37 anos, morto a tiros na rua Goulart, também no bairro Santa Luzia, no dia 30 de agosto do ano passado.

Cada vez que vengo a París no creo que vaya a ganar. Llego emocionado de poder hacerlo, pero sabiendo que el resultado más lógico es que no lo hago. Ganar no es normal y siempre soy muy consciente de ello. Como decía desde el primer día, este año ha sido el Roland Garros más adverso en el que he jugado, primero por las condiciones y segundo porque mi preparación era prácticamente nula en cuanto a torneos se refiere.

He did call the three-strikes rule “wacko” at one point, even as he was helping to write the bill. Whatever his reservations about certain provisions, he ultimately voted for the legislation, which included the three-strikes rule and has come to be seen in the Black Lives Matter era as a heavy-handed and discriminatory tool of the justice system.

The opportunity to see Beyonce live is not one you pass up, however nobody knows when she will be back to grace us with her formidable presence so anyone who needs to get their Beyonce fix should watch ‘Homecoming’ on Netflix and listen to the live album with the same title. Seeing a live performance, whether it be in the flesh or through a screen, is enough to make you realise that she really is our Queen and we have no choice to bow down.

  # Let’s get Florida working


  Jimmy Patronis


  Guest columnist


  Just weeks ago, folks in Tallahassee got some bad, although not unexpected news. According to the state revenue experts, over the next two years Florida is going to be short over $5 billion as a result of COVID-19.


  As Florida’s chief financial officer, I have confidence that with the leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis, President-Designate Wilton Simpson and Speaker-Designate Chris Sprowls, we’ll weather this storm and come out better than before.


  While there is some good news, and we’ve already seen signs of a recovery as the state’s unemployment rate begins to drop, if we hope to balance the budget it will be up to us to act with urgency in right-sizing state government while helping the private sector get back on its feet. That’s why I’m committed to prioritizing liability protections for the upcoming legislative session.


  Since the pandemic began, I’ve spoken to business owners and participated in meetings with more than 30 chambers of commerce statewide and many of these employers barely have enough capital to get back on their feet. Not only can they not afford to deal with COVID-19 lawsuits, but they also cannot afford the spike in insurance rates that would result from increased litigation. That’s why, to protect businesses and get our economy back-up-and-running, I recently released three guiding principles for liability protections aimed at helping lawmakers as they craft bills.


  The first principle is encouraging businesses to do right by their employees and customers through taking steps to fight the spread of COVID-19. When I travel the state, I see business owners doing the right things: They’re wearing masks, they’re cleaning their facilities, they’re making sanitizer available to the public and they’re encouraging social distancing.


  Setting the expectation through law that businesses need to take COVID-19 seriously is especially important as Florida is so heavily reliant on tourism. If out-of-state families consider traveling to Florida, they want to know our economy is back open and we’re serious about protecting residents and visitors. For whatever bill ultimately gets filed, passed and sent to the governor, it’s just fair to tell businesses that if we’re going to provide unique COVID-19 protections from litigation, they need to step-up and make sure to do what it takes to keep people safe.


  The second principle is keeping liability protections consistent and simple. In my years in the Legislature, many times I’ve seen everyone agree on something and then rewrite a bill to give someone a leg up or punish another group. We can’t allow a politics-as-usual to succeed when there is such urgency to get our economy back on its feet.


  Liability protections should be easy to understand, they shouldn’t pick winners and losers, and they cannot be over-lawyered to the point that small business owners can’t understand them. Bigger businesses will always have the personnel at their disposal to make sure they don’t get in trouble, but our small business owners don’t have the time, money, or expertise to follow overly technical rules. Let’s pass protections that everyone can understand, so we can all follow the law and get this economy reopened.


  My third and final principle is making sure justice comes before exorbitant legal fees. No doubt, there are some businesses that are indifferent as to who gets hurt by the coronavirus, and they should rightfully face consequences. All it takes, however, is a few activist judges to open the floodgates to predatory attorneys who will target businesses — even if those businesses are trying their best and what’s right. As the Legislature deliberates, let’s figure out a way to make sure the only reason to bring a COVID lawsuit is justice — not attorneys’ fees.


  I know we can get this done. In fact, six other states have enacted some kind of COVID-19 protections for businesses. I have already spoken with several legislators that are ready to fight for small business owners, and recently the governor came out in support of liability protections.


  However, we can’t assume any of this is a done deal. We need to be vocal and communicate to Florida’s business owners that we’re committed to getting this done. It already takes a lot of courage to start a business, but re-opening when the COVID lawsuits have just begun is yet another hurdle to getting our economy up and running.


  Let’s support the men and women that make our state great and let them do what they do best — get Florida working

The situation as we speak is that the SA Agulhas sailed about an hour ago and she is en route to Gough Island. She has two helicopters and a doctor on board and will be responsible for the extraction of the injured. We know of two injuries but none are life-threatening.

Pretty disappointing when u read the brief history of putting this tournie together. It really sounds like a bunch of ole premadonnas are running our fair game. All walking around like their own shit don't stink.

In April, Andrew Yang, then a Democratic presidential candidate, sued the New York State Board of Elections after it effectively canceled the Democratic presidential primary. He argued that doing so was illegal since he already had met the requirements for having his name to appear on the ballot. One month after the suit was filed, a judge agreed with Yang and ordered the state to proceed with its presidential primary.

Of those, I suspect only the ANZAC team is even close to feasible and even then it would only be the NZ players who would still be playing Mitre 10 Cup that would be close to match fit. On that basis it would appear that it will be reduced to a three team comp, but money can be a great motivator so anything is possible.

Beyonce leads a revolution of female domination and paves the way for the female artists that follow. She is a force to be reckoned with and a force the world is in dire need of - a powerful, successful black woman that provides a platform for the voices that we all need to hear and listen to, particularly in light of the Black Lives Matter movement. She allows these voices to be heard loud and clear through her live performances and Beyonce will never silence them.

“Millions of people’s lives are at stake in the short term, and in the long term they also potentially face the risk for developing new drug resistance to TB, with much poorer outcomes. We cannot forget communities in low- and middle-income countries that are being doubly hit by the pandemic and the crisis of TB,” the union noted in a statement.

It seems, therefore, not only unfair, but unnecessary, for Sicily to have been tarred with the same brush as the rest of country. It is, after all, an island, making the regulation of traffic on and off far easier than in continental Italy. With rates far below that of most of Britain, and Covid tests now obligatory for anyone entering Italy, it should surely be possible to travel to Sicily from the UK without needing to quarantine on return.

Sony's PS5 UI video probably wasn't being used to tease a new Killzone game, despite what some fans might believe. A recent post from Reddit user Cryptostormz noted that Killzone appeared to be front-and-centre of yesterday's video, but it's looking unlikely that that's going to transition into a full-blown game.


  When Sony began its UI video, PlayStation senior director of global content communications, Sid Shuman, noted that he was booting the console up from rest mode, and had already created an account. As Crytostormz points out, not only did that account use a Killzone avatar, but the character the account is named after - Kenzo Hakan - is pretty obscure, his narrative hidden away in an audio log about leaking hidden information. Sony could easily have used the likes of Aloy, Kratos, or even Peter Parker in this video, so the double Killzone reference had fans of the series excited.


  Sadly, however, it looks like it's probably not to be. As pointed out elsewhere on Reddit, Sony has been using that Scotty Kenzo name and avatar since at least 2017, when it was discussing the PS4's v5.0 update. It might be notable that it's been carried over to the PS5, but it's unlikely to have been an out-and-out teaser.


  Of course, it's been a while since the last Killzone game - Shadow Fall was a launch game for the PS4 back in 2013 - which could suggest that something is in the works, but with no sign of the series in the PS5 launch games, if we do ever see another entry, it's likely to still be some time away.


   _Perhaps one day we'll see Killzone on a list of_ _upcoming PS5 games_ _, but for now you'll just have to stick with that we've got coming already._

Not coincidentally, Klein is a leading anti-Israel advocate. Destroying western civilization, supporting terrorists, abolishing capitalism, ending Israel, and now using the laboratory created Wuhan virus to shut the US economy, are all one and the same platform. The platform of one of the two major US political parties.

Adds fundraising figures)
 By Trevor Hunnicutt and Joseph Ax
 Oct 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will hold dueling prime-time town halls instead of a second presidential debate on Thursday, as Americans continued to swamp polling places in states allowing early in-person voting.
 With less than three weeks to go until Nov. 3's Election Day, the Republican president is trying to change the dynamics of a race in which Biden has a double-digit advantage in some national polls.
 North Carolina, a highly competitive state, began more than two weeks of in- person early voting on Thursday, following huge turnout in Georgia and Texas earlier in the week.
 Video from local media showed large numbers of people waiting for the polls to open in Greensboro and Winston-Salem, and gathering in the pre-dawn hours to vote at two arenas in the state's largest city, Charlotte.
 Gerry Cohen, a member of the election board in the county that includes most of the city of Raleigh, saw more than 400 people in line at a community center before polls opened.
 "I've never seen this many in line here," he said on Twitter.
 Nearly 18 million Americans have cast ballots either in person or by mail so far, representing 12.9% of the total votes counted in the 2016 general election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.
 Voters are seeking to avoid in-person lines on Election Day to stay safe as coronavirus infections and hospitalizations continue to rise, but also to make sure their ballots will count. Many are concerned that Trump will challenge widely used mail-in ballots, after he claimed without evidence that they were fraudulent.
 Trump's campaign is counting on a surge of last-minute votes. But Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted from Friday to Tuesday shows there are far fewer undecided likely voters this year - around 8% - and they are just as likely to pick Biden as they are Trump.
 Four years ago at this stage of the campaign, more than twice as many people were similarly wavering between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.
 The Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Biden holding a 10-percentage-point lead nationally, with a tighter margin in the battleground states that will help decide the election.
 $1.5 BILLION
 Democratic fundraising organization ActBlue said on Thursday it collected $1.5 billion online from July to September, the most it had ever raised in one quarter. By comparison, major Republican fundraising platform WinRed said on Monday that it collected $623.5 million in the same period.
 "We've raised more money than I ever thought we could," Biden told donors at an event.
 Both candidates have been visiting battleground states this week, with Trump holding rallies in Florida, Pennsylvania and Iowa and Biden traveling to Ohio and Florida.
 Speaking to a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, on Thursday, Trump promised an economic recovery if he was re-elected. "We're going to have a red wave," he said.
 The U.S. economy tanked in the second quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic, and at least 25 million remained on jobless benefits at the end of September, Labor Department figures showed on Thursday.
 Trump pulled out of Thursday's scheduled debate when the commission in charge of organizing the event said it would be held virtually after he contracted the coronavirus. A final debate is still scheduled for Oct. 22 in Nashville, Tennessee.
 The town halls, in which each candidate will field questions from voters, will take place at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT), with Trump on NBC from Miami and Biden on ABC from Philadelphia.
 A group of 100 Hollywood actors and producers wrote a letter of protest to NBC, saying that airing Trump's town hall was "enabling the President's bad behavior while undercutting the Presidential Debate Commission and doing a disservice to the American public."
 The Biden campaign said on Thursday that two people involved in the campaign had tested positive for COVID-19, including one on the staff of Senator Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate.
 Biden had been on a plane with one of the two who tested positive but was not in close contact and did not need to quarantine, his campaign said in a statement. While Harris was also not in close contact with the people, the campaign said it was canceling Harris' travel until after Sunday.
 "This shows how seriously we take COVID, how we have since March done everything in our power as a campaign to ensure the safety of our staff and volunteers and voters," Biden's campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, told reporters on a call.

Aiphone, the renowned international manufacturer of intercom and security communication products, has added the IXG-MK IP Video Guard Station to its robust portfolio of solutions in its IXG Series Multi-Tenant Video Intercom System. The IXG-MK provides visitors a convenient way to call a building's concierge, receptionist, or security guard directly from the entrance station. This is helpful when visitors are unsure how to reach a tenant or if they are simply trying to deliver a package to the front desk. Once safe intent has been determined, calls can then be transferred to the proper apartment or suite, or the door unlocked for deliveries. Clear video identification "Perimeter security is more important than ever, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased interest in occupancy management," said Paul Hefty, Technical Sales & Support Engineer, for Aiphone Corp. "This additional layer of security will ensure only approved visitors will be allowed inside, keeping tenants and building assets safer." Those screening visitors can choose either hands-free (VOX) or full duplex (handset) communication The IXG- MK offers flexibility and simplicity to end-users with a seven-inch touchscreen for clear video identification, video communication between guard stations, call recording, and the ability to forward calls directly to a tenant. Those screening visitors can choose either hands-free (VOX) or full duplex (handset) communication. Touching the key button will activate the door release associated with the connected entrance station or door station. Network-based communication platform An ideal solution for any multi-tenant housing or office facility, the IXG-MK can have up to 9,999 units in its address book and will maintain a history of calls received. The IXG Series Multi-Tenant Video Intercom solution is a sophisticated, streamlined way to connect a variety of mixed-use buildings. This series is a complete network- based communication platform offering a variety of options for any multi- tenant security application. Throughout 2020, Aiphone will be celebrating its 50th Anniversary in North America by thanking customers, dealers, integrators, and employees for providing the opportunity to develop and improve better security and communication solutions.

Stanley said that to be invested in Jamaica dollar (JMD), this currently requires a minimum of 10 per cent on the investment which in this environment presents, "a very difficult task to achieve", making it hard for investors to stay ahead of the game.

Second, every time Biden tried to appeal to those worried centrists, as he did by trying to walk away from the Green New Deal or his Marxist friendly tax plans, he had to alienate his base. While Trump is working to increase his base's turnout, which may see a 10% or even a 20% increase in votes for him, Biden is alienating his radical base by appealing to the 1% or 2% of undecided voters in the country. Looked at from this perspective, neither Trump's words nor his affect alienated his all-important base. Meanwhile, Biden once again was unable to square the circle of pleasing both Marxists and normal Americans.

In April, Andrew Yang, then a Democratic presidential candidate, sued the New York State Board of Elections after it effectively canceled the Democratic presidential primary. He argued that doing so was illegal since he already had met the requirements for having his name to appear on the ballot. One month after the suit was filed, a judge agreed with Yang and ordered the state to proceed with its presidential primary.

Nevertheless, funding continues to fall short of needs in all sectors to support the over 11 million people in need in Syria and the 5.6 million refugees in the region, also considering the additional burden caused by COVID-19 and the Beirut port explosion. Despite donor generosity, the Syria Humanitarian Response Plan and the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan are only funded at 43% and 28% respectively.
