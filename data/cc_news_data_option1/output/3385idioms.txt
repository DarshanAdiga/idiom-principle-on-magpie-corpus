The Compulsions have shared a video clip of the track "Funk #666", a track from their forthcoming album, "Ferocious," which is set to be released on November 13th.
 The album features frontman Rob Carlyle joined by some notable musicians including former Guns N' Roses guitarist Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal, David Bowie album Earl Slick, former Raging Slab bassist Alec Morton, and former Dolls drummer Brian Delaney.
 "I love all the tracks on Ferocious. But the music and lyrics of 'Funk #666' seem to really capture all the doom and gloom going on in the world today - and what's kinda eerie is I wrote that song five years ago!" says Carlyle.
 Rob also explained the choice of the covers on the new album, "Ever since I started The Compulsions, the idea was to create a sound that lives somewhere between The Stones and GN'R. Like if you put Sticky Fingers and Appetite for Destruction in a blender.
 "So, this time around, I thought let's just spell it out for people by actually covering those two bands. I've always loved 'Dead Flowers' and 'Dust N' Bones,' anyway, and I had a pretty good idea of how to put our own spin on those songs." Check out the teaser video below:

 The 41st meeting of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is slated to be held on Thursday via video conferencing, and it has just one agenda for discussion — making up for shortfall in states’ revenues, sources said.
 Sushil Modi said states have to be compensated to the tune of ₹3.65 lakh crore in the current fiscal, out of which Bihar’s share is around ₹12,000 crore for 2020-21.
 Usually, states are paid from the ‘Compensation Cess Fund’ for the shortfall, but there is a small sum left in that fund now, he added.
 Earlier in the day, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said “refusal” by the Centre to pay GST compensation to the states is nothing short of a betrayal of the trust of the people of India.

_O presidente da ARS mandou para lá os médicos fazerem o que lhes competia, e os gajos, cobardes, não fizeram_. Foram estas as palavras, doravante célebres, que António Costa pronunciou _off the record_ , enquanto falava numa entrevista para o _Expresso_. Como se sabe, os médicos, esses “gajos cobardes”, não gostaram. O Sindicato Independente dos Médicos protestou. A Ordem dos Médicos, pela voz sempre cordata do seu bastonário, Miguel Pinheiro, protestou. E uma reunião deste último com Costa, em S. Bento, desencadeou novo protesto, já que, de acordo com a Ordem, as palavras de Costa durante o encontro de três horas que tiveram, não transpareceram na comunicação final (sem direito a perguntas) de Costa aos jornalistas: Costa limitou-se a manifestar o seu “apreço” pela classe médica e o seu desejo que o “mal- entendido” ficasse encerrado, enquanto na conversa a sua atitude teria supostamente sido muito mais auto-crítica.

In a nutshell, the bill seeks to update the laws governing Banks, Financial Institutions and Financial Services; enhance efficiency in the process of obtaining and/or granting of banking licenses; impose stiffer penalties for regulatory breaches in the financial services industry and also regulate the activities of Financial Technology Companies (FINTECHs). Impressed by the submission of Senator Uba Sani, the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan proceeded to put it to vote and demanded if it was the wish of the Senate that the Bill be read for the third time and passed into law. It was a unanimous “yes” from all the Senators in the Chambers. The third reading was promptly taken and the President of the Senate sealed it with the slamming of his gavel. And in the fine tradition of the Senate, the President of the Senate proceeded to, on behalf of the Senate, approve that Senator Uba Sani’s prayers: "That the Senate do approve the attached recommendations of the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions on a Bill for an Act to Repeal the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act, CAP, B3, LFN, 2004 and Re-enact the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act, 2020," be granted. The Bill was read a third time and passed into law. For the second time in two weeks, the President of the Senate The Banking and other Financial Institutions Act was last amended/reviewed in 1991. It is therefore long overdue for review and amendment.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The governor of Minnesota activated the National Guard on Wednesday night to help quell unrest that broke out in downtown Minneapolis following what authorities said was misinformation about the suicide death of a Black homicide suspect. "We once again see the unrest on our streets. And not just Minnesota but as a nation, this pain continues on," Gov. Tim Walz said at a late night news conference. Walz declared a peacetime emergency in Minneapolis and said he was mobilizing the Minnesota National Guard but did not say how many troops were being deployed. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey imposed a curfew Wednesday night until 6 a.m. Thursday and requested National Guard help after people broke windows and stole merchandise from downtown stores."Minneapolis, it's time to heal. We must rebuild and recover. Dangerous, unlawful behavior will not be tolerated," the Democratic governor said in a statement. Minneapolis was rocked by protests that turned violent after George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, died after a white police officer pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes on May 25. Floyd's death sparked protests worldwide. Demonstrators also have gathered in downtown Minneapolis this week to protest after Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot multiple times by police in Wisconsin on Sunday, leaving him paralyzed.In Minneapolis, Floyd's death set off several nights of violence, including the burning of a Minneapolis police precinct office, until Walz activated the National Guard. South Minneapolis, where Floyd was arrested, and North Minneapolis saw the brunt of vandalism, but downtown Minneapolis was largely spared.TV footage and reporter's tweets Wednesday night showed people grabbing merchandise at a Saks OFF 5TH store, a fire at a British pub and broken windows on the door and shrimp scattered on the sidewalk outside Ruth's Chris Steak House. Minnesota Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell said fireworks were being set off and bottles thrown late Wednesday, and there were reports of gunshots.Police were making arrests and trying to clear downtown, Schnell told reporters. The number of arrests would not be available until Thursday morning, Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said. One officer was hospitalized with a serious injury that was not life-threatening, Elder said.The Minnesota State Patrol has mobilized about 150 troopers and all available metro area state troopers in response to the unrest in Minneapolis, Walz said."This is part of a larger narrative. It was the flash point of George Floyd, it has spread across this nation. It does us no good to try and either divide or ignore or to make it worse or to blame someone. We're just, as a state and as a nation, going to have to come together and figure out what our next steps are," Walz told reporters.Frey said during a news conference Wednesday night that he and Walz had been in contact to address the unrest. Frey said bolstering enforcement was an effort to "stay ahead of the game as much as possible." "What we're calling for right now is peace," Frey said. "What we're calling for right now is for people to return to their homes."Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo dispelled rumors on social media about the death of an unidentified Black man suspected in a Wednesday afternoon homicide, who later fatally shot himself on the Nicollet Mall as officers approached. The incident, which was captured on city surveillance video and released by police within 90 minutes, nonetheless sparked protests and looting in the heart of downtown.The video confirmed the police account of what happened and showed the man glancing over his shoulder before pulling out the gun and firing, then collapsing to the ground as a half-dozen witnesses ran away with their hands in the air, according to the Star Tribune. The officers, one of whom had his gun drawn, shooed a remaining witness away and kicked the suspect’s gun away before performing chest compressions."This is not an officer-related incident," Arradondo said. "We're compounding more tragedy by the destruction and folks wanting to do harm to our communities in our downtown sector this evening.""This is my city. We will not tolerate that," he continued.___AP reporter Steve Karnowski contributed from Minneapolis.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

“Joe Biden said America is systemically racist,” Pence said, criticizing the Democratic challenger as soft on crime. “The hard truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”
 In a speech from Fort McHenry in Maryland, the site of the 1812 battle that inspired “The Star-Spangled Banner,” he added: “Law and order are on the ballot. ... The choice in this election is whether America remains America.”
 With Trump trailing in the polls, Pence has endured months of rumors that he could be replaced on the ticket. But the president has singled him out for praise repeatedly in recent weeks, and his place, decidedly second to Trump, seems safe.
 The president joined Pence onstage after his speech.
 ##  2\. Crises drain convention attention
 A political convention is the most scripted, tightly controllable of events, especially when it is mostly virtual and much of it is prerecorded.
 That is, until events beyond the control of convention planners make the political ritual seem almost inconsequential.
 As Republicans gathered, a massive hurricane was taking aim at the Gulf Coast, wildfires continued to scorch California and the National Guard was being deployed to a city in the battleground state of Wisconsin after a white police officer shot a Black man. And all the while a deadly pandemic continued to claim the lives of nearly 1,000 Americans a day.
 In true Trump style, though, campaign officials said the show must go on, so far anyway.

The Democratic presidential nominee said, "What I saw on that video makes me sick. Once again, a Black man, Jacob Blake, been shot by the police in broad daylight with the whole world watching."
 "Put yourself in the shoes of every Black father and Black mother in this country, and ask: Is this what we want America to be? Is this the country we should be?" Biden said.
 Harris said at an event on Wednesday that she and Biden both spoke to the family.
 "What happened there is so tragic and still represents the two systems of justice in America," the Democratic vice presidential nominee said. "There are still two systems of justice in America and ... we need to fight again for that ideal that says all people are supposed to be treated equally, which is still not happening."
 A White House official told CNN efforts have been made to connect President Donald Trump with the Blake family. The President has yet to comment directly on the case, but officials have been waiting on more details from federal and state investigators who are looking into the case.
 Two Kenosha police officers have been placed on administrative leave, and the shooting is being investigated by Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley's office and the Wisconsin Justice Department's division of criminal investigation.
 Protests have raged in Kenosha following the police shooting. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers on Tuesday declared a state of emergency, deployed members of the Wisconsin National Guard to Kenosha and implemented an 8 p.m. CT curfew. Buildings and cars in Kenosha have been set on fire, and two people were killed and a third was seriously wounded in a shooting during a protest.

The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its order on a review petition filed by fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya against a 2017 verdict of contempt against him.
 The Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Ashok Bhushan on May 9, 2017, found Mr. Mallya guilty of contempt for wilful disobedience of its order to come clean on his assets and not disclosing a sum of $40 million (₹600 crore) he received from British liquor major Diageo Plc following his resignation as Chairman of United Spirits Limited in February 2016.
 The Bench had in the last hearing raised the issue of why the review plea was not listed before the court for last three years.
 In his original arguments in 2017, Mr. Mallya had informed the court that the $40 million was one among “thousands of transactions” he did and could not be counted as an asset. He said he had no control over that money now as he had already disbursed it among his three adult children, who were U.S. citizens.
 Countering allegations made by a banking consortium led by the State Bank of India, which had filed the contempt of court petition against him, Mr. Mallya said he had already given a complete list of assets as of March 31, 2016. The court had ordered him to provide the banks with a list of his assets so that they could recover ₹9,200 crore due to them.
 The banks had sought contempt action against Mr. Mallya, arguing that the disbursal of the $40 million among his three children was in direct violation of a standing Karnataka High Court order that none of his assets should be “alienated, disposed of or be subjected to the creation of third party rights.”
