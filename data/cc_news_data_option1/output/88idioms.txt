"Right now is the second worst I've ever seen," Breuer said. “The rest of the season is going to be ugly; no matter what happens from here on out, we started behind the eight ball and we’re going to stay there.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Looking at the upside, Beardsley said the fact that fewer fish are being caught this winter could bode well for the open water season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Lake of the Woods has largely been the benefactor of such poor ice since it’s one of the few places that has maintained solid fishing conditions, according to multiple sources. Bryan “Beef” Sathre of Fathead Guide Service said it’s not hard to find ice on Lake of the Woods that’s between 21 and 24 inches thick. He said he would not be surprised if it’s the best ice in the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Anglers from across the region apparently have heard the same thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 “I’ve never seen so many fishermen, wheelhouses, portables, trucks -- whatever you want to call it -- on the lake. In the evenings on Friday and Saturday, it looked like downtown Minneapolis-St. Paul out there,” Sathre said.

As the prelude of this piece makes obvious, data will play an incredible role in the future workplace environment. According to IDC, global data storage will soar from 33 zettabytes to an astounding 175 zettabytes by 2025 (a 61% increase in the world’s data pool). Furthermore, firms are correct to believe that Big Data will become an essential component to the acceleration and enhancement of future enterprise operations. A survey conducted by Modis shows that 97% of companies believe data can be leveraged in the future to help optimize various business units.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Today, we call people who sift through masses of information “data analysts.” But in 2030, the term “data analyst” will serve as the overarching label for a _slew_ of different, specialized data-related jobs, such as data analytics for IoT devices, drones, genetic modification, nutrition and more. In addition, unlike the workplace environment of today in which data workers play it solo, in the future, artificial intelligence (AI) will be used to augment the process of statistical gathering and analytics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A helping hand in the form of AI is necessary. According to IDC, “44% of time is being wasted every week because data workers are unsuccessful in their activities.” As you read this article, 54 million people worldwide are wasting their precious time on work that AI could accomplish in the blink of an eye.
