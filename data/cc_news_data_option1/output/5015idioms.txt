The Cardinal (2-2) opened the game on a 20-3 run over the first eight minutes of play. Stanford enjoyed their largest first-half lead at 29-11 with 7:57 remaining in the half. The Aggies (2-4) responded with a 12-2 run as they held the Cardinal to just 1-for-10 shooting over the final eight minutes to cut the deficit to 31-23 at the break.

The existing 42-cyclone relief centres, multipurpose evacuation halls, along with 191 temporary relief camps we arranged could accommodate 1.95 lakh people. However, with a view to adhering to the COVID protocol, the capacity of each facility was reduced. This made increasing the numbers of the camp necessary. We raised the numbers to 441, and housed 52,266 people by November 26 morning by maintaining highest order of social distancing. Adequate provisions were stocked at each camp. We also created Rapid Response Teams of 400 medical professionals and dispatched them to 50-odd camps across the district.

However, there are still important actions Ontario’s universities can take to address these concerns. Reducing class sizes by hiring additional, securely employed faculty, will ensure students receive more one-on-one support and a better educational experience. Lowering tuition fees will help students struggling to make ends meet, now and after the pandemic. Finally, investments in better resources for students, faculty, and academic librarians—especially technology supports—would improve educational outcomes and address the mental and emotional burn-out many are feeling.

Jerald Leon and Barbara Jean (Taylor) Elmore will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary on Saturday from 2-5 p.m. at 8508 Canopy Oaks Drive, Fort Smith. They were married on Dec. 11, 1960.


   


  Their journey began in 1957, when Jerald spotted his future bride at a local eatery sitting with another boy. It was at that moment, he decided to make a play for her if ever given the chance. Two years later, he saw her at the local skating rink with her sisters. Unable to think of a way to introduce himself, he skated up behind her, kicked her skates out from under her and caught her as she was falling down. They visited all night and he asked her out on a date; however, due to a swollen jaw from a watermelon fight with some buddies, he had to cancel that first date. Luckily, she gave him a second chance, and they have been together ever since.


   


  Through the years they've had numerous homes and businesses. They viewed moving to a new home as an adventure; yet other than the seven years of military life they lived while Jerald served in the U.S. Air Force, they never strayed too far from their hometown of Fort Smith. Jerald worked for two local packaging companies for over 30 years, while Barbara managed a full-body toning salon for a few years before they both retired and opened Dee's Used Furniture. Even though they dabbled in the resale business all along the way, it was that shop that revealed their real passion and talent for buying and selling.


   


  Jerald and Barbara have three daughters, DeRhonda and Steve Robison, Tammy and Harold Matlock and Terry Elmore; eight grandchildren; and 19 great- grandchildren.


   


  Family and friends are invited to the celebration. Masks and hand sanitizer will be available and social distancing will be observed.

BELLAIRE -- Two Allegan County brothers implicated in an alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have posted bond and been released from jail.


   


  Michael Null, of Plainwell, and William Null, of Shelbyville, both 38, bonded out Thursday, the Antrim County Sheriff's Office confirmed to WOOD-TV 8.


   


  Their bond was set Wednesday at $250,000, and they had to put up 10 percent of that to get out, according to the Michigan Attorney General's Office.


   


  The brothers are among 14 men who are accused of taking part in a plot to kidnap Whitmer. Federal authorities say they believed the executive orders she issued in response to the coronavirus were an overreach of her power.


   


  Investigators say some of the suspects, including the Nulls, scoped out her vacation home in Antrim County. The group also allegedly designed and tested bombs, bought a Taser to use in the abduction and considered how to blow up a bridge.


   


  After the suspects were arrested in early October, Bill Null's neighbors said they were shocked to learn the allegations against him. They said they knew him to be a "normal, pretty nice fellow."


   


  Bill Null was a co-founded of the Michigan Liberty Militia, and his brother was also a member. The Michigan Attorney General's Office has said they were also members of a militia called the Wolverine Watchmen that was involved in the kidnapping plot.


   


  The Nulls were charged at the state level with providing material support for a terrorist act and weapons charges. The majority of the suspects face similar state-level charges, but six of them have been charged with conspiracy at the federal level.


   


  One of the state-level suspects, Shawn Fix of Belleville, was released on bond last month. Paul Bellar of Milford and Pete Musico, of Munith, also posted bond and were released, the AG says. The others are still behind bars.

  If it’s anything like the fall, there will be plenty of changes and a lot of adjusting. Will an indoor setting affect play more? There are many questions up in the air regarding how winter sports will work through the pandemic. We won’t know for sure until it starts, but it’s certainly a top story heading into the new season.

The Cardinals took the field Sunday with something to prove. Going into the game, they had been 6-5, in a position to make the playoffs for the first time since 2015.


  But, in his three seasons as coach of the Rams, Coach Sean McVay had been 6-0 against Arizona with an average victory margin of 23.3 points.


  In 2017, the Rams effectively ended both Carson Palmer's career and the Bruce Arians era in London. In 2018, a 34-0 thrashing in Week 2 took the gloss off Steve Wilks' coaching tenure almost before it began. Last year, quarterback Kyler Murray had the worst game of his young career in a 34-7 home loss.


  "We've got to try and put an end to that," coach Kliff Kingsbury had said before the game.


  "Every moment counts. Every play counts. Every situation counts," cornerback Patrick Peterson had said before the game. "We have to be a smart, physical football team down the stretch, because that's what's going to get us over the top."


  The Cardinals' offense has struggled the past two weeks, averaging only 19 points per game in losses to the Seahawks and Patriots. It had a tough task against a stout Rams defense that features two of the best players in the NFL: defensive tackle Aaron Donald and cornerback Jalen Ramsey.

SEATTLE (AP) — Laughed at and mocked for being on top of the worst division in the NFL, the New York Giants now have an impressive win to validate their spot as NFC East leaders. The matchup of first-place teams in the NFC went an unexpected direction. “The team had a different swagger about them, had a different juice about them today because we know we played our brand of football,” Giants safety Jabrill Peppers said. “We know we can shock a lot of people.” Alfred Morris scored a pair of third-quarter touchdowns, the New York defense shut down Russell Wilson and one of the top offenses in the league, and the Giants stunned the Seattle Seahawks 17-12 on Sunday. Double- digit underdogs, the Giants (5-7) handed Seattle its first home loss of the season, sent the NFC West race into some mayhem, and kept their spot on top of the NFC East for another week. Following its 0-5 start, New York has won five of its past seven, the last four in a row. New York had been close in tight losses to Tampa Bay and the Rams, but picked the perfect time to get its first victory over a team with a winning record. “These guys do a great job,” Giants coach Joe Judge said. \"They’ve done everything we’ve asked them to do, and they’ve done it as well as they possibly can. And you see the results come in.” The Giants did it with starting quarterback Daniel Jones (hamstring) a spectator after getting hurt last week against Cincinnati. Colt McCoy was far from spectacular but made key plays and avoided critical mistakes following a first-half interception. McCoy was 13 of 22 for 105 yards, and Wayne Gallman rushed for 135 yards on 16 carries. For McCoy, it was his first victory since Oct. 27, 2014 when he led Washington past Dallas. He completed 25 of 30 passes for 299 yards,...

The Double Cluster is a must for a late autumn evening sweep of the night sky, with even a small pair of binoculars. You can catch this spectacular star cluster pair with just your eyes on a dark night.      The pair is easy to find. Just look for the "Big M" \- the five stars of Cassiopeia, nearly overhead in the northeastern sky at about 8 p.m. in early December. The bottom two stars of the "M" outline forms a nearly right triangle with the Double Cluster, situated to the right.      The Double Cluster is actually within the constellation Perseus, the Champion.      To the naked eyes on a dark night, the Double Cluster appears as a twin, fuzzy patch. They lay in front of the dim Milky Way Band, which passes through Cassiopeia. This is a wonderland of faint stars and star clusters within reach of binoculars and is especially rich in a telescope's eyepiece.      The Double Cluster is also referred to separately as NGC 869 and NGC 884. The clusters are about 7,500 light-years from us. Each cluster has approximately 300 stars. The clusters are only a few hundred light-years apart; imagine the night sky from a planet orbiting any star nearby!      Binoculars begin to resolve the Double Cluster into their true nature, a whole lot of faint stars jammed near each other! Open star clusters are numerous across the heavens; each one is uniquely laid out and a delight to examine. The Pleiades is easily the most famous, a bright, compact, glittering patch of stars to behold with eyes alone.      The Double Cluster, however, is just that - two open star clusters of comparable size, richness and brightness, situated in close proximity in the sky.      The view in even a small telescope can be breathtaking. Take note of the little patterns the cluster stars make, the abundance of white and bluish- white stars and even a few dim, red stars sprinkled for good measure. You'll find a red star smack dab between the two clusters.      Use a low-power eyepiece to give a wider field of view. That way you are more likely to see both clusters at the same time. Then exchange the eyepiece for a higher magnification and slowly scan around this area, comparing the clusters.      Then you may like to slowly venture in the sky right around the Double Cluster, using a small telescope and low power. I like to drop in on another interesting star arrangement close by, which to my imagination resembles a fish outline, but a fish sporting two whip antennae. As far as I know, this is not a true star cluster, but a chance arrangement of stars. See what you find.      I say "open star cluster" because there are also "globular star clusters," hundreds of thousands of stars packed tight together in a ball, fraying at the edges, resembling what I get when I take a snowball at night and smash in against a dry sidewalk or asphalt road (doesn't everyone do that?).      Perseus is an easily seen constellation, located between Cassiopeia and the Pleiades star cluster. In early evening, look up (of course; looking down the only celestial object you will see is planet Earth under your feet), in the east-northeast. Cassiopeia is on the left, high in the northeast; the Pleiades will be fairly high in the east.      At this time, the Perseus star pattern places his (Perseus') head to the left, and stars marking his feet to the right.      The Pleiades cluster is just off the lower "foot" of Perseus.      One of the brighter and most well-known stars of Perseus is Algol, an eclipsing binary star that varies in brightness every 2 days, 20 hours and 48 minutes. Usually, the star is at maximum light, magnitude +2.3. There is a dimmer, close companion star orbiting Algol which regularly partly eclipses it, dropping its magnitude to +3.5. It stays at minimum light for only 20 minutes. It takes 4 1/2 hours for Algol to drop in brightness and another 4 1/2 to recover.      Many stars are like this, but Algol is one of the easiest to see and follow with eyes alone.      Take a look fairly low in the southwestern sky during evening twilight for Saturn and Jupiter. The two planets are getting closer and closer to each other, as seen from Earth. The apparent distance between them will shrink through Dec. 21, when the pair will look like a "double planet" \- a spectacular and rare conjunction. This weekend they are about 1.8 degrees apart (about the width of three "full moons"). On Dec. 21 they will be just a tenth of a degree apart, about one-fifth the apparent width of the moon.      Jupiter is the brighter planet, to the lower right of Saturn.      Mars, dimming but still bright, is high in the south at around 8 p.m.      Venus is the bright "Morning Star" seen low in the eastern sky before dawn. Mercury is also there, but very low and not as bright.      Last quarter moon is on Tuesday, Dec. 8.   Keep looking up at the sky!

Actions speak louder than words but our prime minister keeps on repeating familiar phrases ‘NRO nahi don ga (will never award concessions to the opposition leaders) whenever and wherever he gets a chance to speak about any issue under the sun. In his recent interview aired on a national TV channel, Prime Minister Imran Khan said opposition alliance Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) would not be permitted to hold their public meeting in Lahore on December 13, though no force would be used to stop the rally. Justifying his strategy, he says cases would be registered against the opposition leaders and all those who would facilitate them in making arrangements for the public meetings in violation of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) to stop spread of Covid-19. It means the vendors facilitating the organisers would face criminal cases. In his own words, the prime minister says first information reports will be filed against those providing them sound system and chairs. Well, just to remind Mr Khan, the government banned PMD’s Multan rally too but the alliance went ahead with the plan. At the eleventh hour, the alliance was given permission to hold the rally. Did the government come up with any visible action against those who earlier broke open the locked gate of the Qasim Bagh Stadium? Let’s see how the government reacts to the Lahore rally. The thing is if the government wants to ban the rally for saving the public health in view of the prevailing pandemic, it must enforce its writ. It should engage the opposition leaders convincing them to defer the plan for some other day. In case of deadlock, it should mobilize public opinion against the opposition. At the end of the day, this is the government that will be answerable to the public on the corona control.

  BELLAIRE -- Two Allegan County brothers implicated in an alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have posted bond and been released from jail.


  Michael Null, of Plainwell, and William Null, of Shelbyville, both 38, bonded out Thursday, the Antrim County Sheriff's Office confirmed to WOOD-TV 8.


  Their bond was set Wednesday at $250,000, and they had to put up 10 percent of that to get out, according to the Michigan Attorney General's Office.


  The brothers are among 14 men who are accused of taking part in a plot to kidnap Whitmer. Federal authorities say they believed the executive orders she issued in response to the coronavirus were an overreach of her power.


  Investigators say some of the suspects, including the Nulls, scoped out her vacation home in Antrim County. The group also allegedly designed and tested bombs, bought a Taser to use in the abduction and considered how to blow up a bridge.


  After the suspects were arrested in early October, Bill Null's neighbors said they were shocked to learn the allegations against him. They said they knew him to be a \"normal, pretty nice fellow.\"


  Bill Null was a co-founded of the Michigan Liberty Militia, and his brother was also a member. The Michigan Attorney General's Office has said they were also members of a militia called the Wolverine Watchmen that was involved in the kidnapping plot.


  The Nulls were charged at the state level with providing material support for a terrorist act and weapons charges. The majority of the suspects face similar state-level charges, but six of them have been charged with conspiracy at the federal level.


  One of the state-level suspects, Shawn Fix of Belleville, was released on bond last month. Paul Bellar of Milford and Pete Musico, of Munith, also posted bond and were released, the AG says. The others are still behind bars.

"The first time it was a tactic to burn years and $12 million for studies, and then they were rejected by the ISC, which set up its own criteria and selected its own projects to which the ISC granted $9 million, much of which has still not been spent. That makes $21 million that was spent or authorized, and it delayed us to the point where we had little time left to develop and successfully pursue a unit.

  Jerald Leon and Barbara Jean (Taylor) Elmore will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary on Saturday from 2-5 p.m. at 8508 Canopy Oaks Drive, Fort Smith. They were married on Dec. 11, 1960.


  Their journey began in 1957, when Jerald spotted his future bride at a local eatery sitting with another boy. It was at that moment, he decided to make a play for her if ever given the chance. Two years later, he saw her at the local skating rink with her sisters. Unable to think of a way to introduce himself, he skated up behind her, kicked her skates out from under her and caught her as she was falling down. They visited all night and he asked her out on a date; however, due to a swollen jaw from a watermelon fight with some buddies, he had to cancel that first date. Luckily, she gave him a second chance, and they have been together ever since.


  Through the years they've had numerous homes and businesses. They viewed moving to a new home as an adventure; yet other than the seven years of military life they lived while Jerald served in the U.S. Air Force, they never strayed too far from their hometown of Fort Smith. Jerald worked for two local packaging companies for over 30 years, while Barbara managed a full-body toning salon for a few years before they both retired and opened Dee's Used Furniture. Even though they dabbled in the resale business all along the way, it was that shop that revealed their real passion and talent for buying and selling.


  Jerald and Barbara have three daughters, DeRhonda and Steve Robison, Tammy and Harold Matlock and Terry Elmore; eight grandchildren; and 19 great- grandchildren.


  Family and friends are invited to the celebration. Masks and hand sanitizer will be available and social distancing will be observed.

The recent exploits of Hardik Pandya with the bat has convinced Virat Kohli that the all-rounder can be India's next finisher. Kohli feels the time has come for Pandya to take the next step in his career and work towards establishing himself as a dependable player in India's middle order in the time to come.


  The India captain's statement comes after Pandya produced another fine knock with the bat, scoring 42 not out off 22 balls to guide India home in a stiff chase of 195 and clinch the series with an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three T20I series.


  READ | 'In the past, we had Dhoni': Australia coach Justin Langer lavishes praise on Hardik Pandya


  "The reason was Hardik coming into the team in 2016 was pure ability. He has raw talent. And now he realises that this is his time, the next 4-5 years, to be that finisher, that bankable player that can win you games from anywhere," Kohli said during the post-match presentation ceremony after India's six- wicket win at the SCG on Sunday.


   


   


  "His plans are right and I'm glad to see that. He plays with all his heart and he certainly got that competitive nature about him and also has the skill to execute that at the highest level."


  What has impressed Kohli the most is seeing the team respond well in the absence of premier players such as Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah. Rohit was not part of India's limited-overs series, while India opted to rest Bumrah for the two T20Is as part of workload management.


  In Bumrah's absence, T Natarajan has stepped up brilliantly, producing fine returns of 3/30 and 2/20 in the two matches. This is just the tonic India need heading into the highly-competitive four-Test series starting December 17 at the Adelaide Oval.


  "We've played as a team in T20 cricket. The fact that we don't have Rohit and Bumrah, our established white ball players, in and still doing well makes me happy," Kohli explained.


  "Everyone has played 14 games at least, recently - so they know what their plans are. We just kept them down to a total which we thought was quite chaseable with the short boundary. It's contributions from the whole team that make you feel better because young players are taking their opportunities."

The Truckload Carriers Association has named ABF Freight's Josh Elmore, from Lincolnton, N.C., a Highway Angel for stopping to help a driver after his vehicle collided with a dump truck.


   


  ABF Freight is based in Fort Smith.


   


  It was a beautiful summer morning and Josh Elmore was northbound on U.S. 220 near Madison, N.C. "I was talking to another driver and checking my mirrors and my speed," he said. "All of a sudden I saw a big cloud of smoke or dust in front of me. I realized there was a dump truck and car that had made contact."


   


  The car was spinning around ahead of Elmore in the left lane and the dump truck was in the right lane. "The car hit the guardrail," Elmore said. "I started getting on my brakes to slow and stop and make sure cars behind me didn't hit him. My first reaction was to stop, protect the scene, and then go check on the driver. I threw my hazards on and came to a stop, blocking traffic in the left lane." As Elmore jumped out, a power company truck stopped traffic in the right lane. He could see that the dump truck went around the bend and pulled over.


   


  Elmore went to check on the driver in the car. "There was debris all over the road," he said. "The driver's air bags had deployed and I didn't know what to expect." As Elmore approached the car he was relieved to see the driver was getting out. "I checked him for injuries and asked him several times if he was okay. He was able to walk around, but was shaken up. He said he was on his way to Raleigh for a business meeting." Elmore remained on the scene for about an hour. He said he's been in a wreck before and understands what it's like. "I try to help people when I can, show some compassion. Whatever happens, I hope I'm never in too much of a hurry to stop and help somebody.


   


  "I try to live by that code every day. That's the way I was raised."


   


  Since the program's inception in August 1997, nearly 1,300 professional truck drivers have been recognized as Highway Angels for the exemplary kindness, courtesy and courage they have displayed while on the job. Thanks to the program's Presenting Sponsor, EpicVue, and Supporting Sponsors, DriverFacts and Drivers Legal Plan, TCA is able to showcase drivers like Mr. Elmore.

It has been argued that a developing economy needs lower interest rates given the need for capital and the trade-off is unavoidable. Has the trade off paid off? Milton Friedman said, quite eloquently, that "One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results." The facts are scarcely convinced by the optics of intent. It is instructive to remember that the economy migrated from eight quarters of slowdown to lockdown and now to a technical recession. Through the period, there has been a sustained clamour for lower interest rates as the panacea for propelling growth and the RBI has duly obliged. The question is has that assumption played out? The poignant fact is the biggest beneficiaries have been the AAA corporates and the government -- which is, given the inflation- repo matrix, effectively enjoying negative rates.
