Water breaks in each half, even in matches played in rainy English conditions, and the chance for each side to make five substitutes have further disrupted the flow of a league that often sells itself on a fast-paced product.But amid the backdrop of financial ruin that cancelling the season would have caused, those imperfections and a few drab matches were worth living with for most."You make the best of what you can," said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp after his side lifted the Premier League trophy at the famous Kop end at Anfield."Everything would be better with fans but for months we knew that would be impossible. A few months ago I thought it was impossible that we play football."By returning even behind closed doors, the financial implications for the Premier League of a potential 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) loss have been mitigated but not completely eradicated.English top-flight clubs are reportedly facing a rebate bill of around 330 million pounds to broadcasters as matches could not be completed on schedule.Broadcasters kept on sideMatchday income has also been lost with no fans in the stands and it remains uncertain if and when they can return for the 2020/21 season, which is due to start in September.Broadcasters were kept on side, though, by being awarded rights to more live games, many of which were shown on free-to-air in the UK, and a made-for-TV schedule that saw just four days without a Premier League game between June 17 and July 22.Free-to-air games also had the added benefit of maintaining public interest with Southampton's 1-0 victory over Manchester City shown on the BBC breaking the Premier League record with a domestic audience of 5.7 million viewers.By completing the season on the field, the Premier League has also avoided potentially very costly legal cases when it comes to who is promoted, relegated and qualifies for European competitions next season.Liverpool got the chance to win a first league title for 30 years without the asterisk of a season decided on points-per-game, while the battles for a place in the Champions League, Europa League and to stay in the top flight will go down to the final day.Rigorous testingFears that the financial motivations for "Project Restart" would outweigh concerns over player welfare have also been eased by a rigorous, twice-weekly testing programme that has resulted in just eight positive cases from the last 15,599 tests over the past five weeks.Project Restart has also given the Premier League a worldwide platform to support to the Black Lives Matter movement with each match beginning with players, staff and officials taking a knee to protest against racial injustice.On the field, there are even more signs of a bright future for English football with the emerging talents of Manchester United's Mason Greenwood, Phil Foden of Manchester City and Arsenal's Bukayo Saka among the star performers of the past five weeks.However, some of the concerns over football's return were realised as fans in Liverpool and Leeds ignored pleas to stay away from stadiums to celebrate their long-awaited title triumphs.A total of 13 arrests were made outside Anfield and Elland Road on Wednesday as thousands gathered on the night both the Premier League and Championship trophies were presented.Premier League CEO Richard Masters described the scenes of mass gatherings of celebration in Liverpool last month as "regrettable".But little else has gone wrong for the Premier League's master plan as a season like no other ends as well as could have been hoped for five weeks ago.",

“When I got here I was at rock bottom and this has been a safe place to refocus, regroup and instead of going in these other cells — you get a dark head space there — you're kind of picking up where you left off on the streets, it gives us time to wrap our head space and start on our recovery before we even get to rehab or drug court,” said Mosely.
 “I think it increases our success rate, it helps keep that mindset that we're better than this,” she said. “When you get in some of these other cells what you're going to be talking about all day long is all your criminal pride and things you did when you were wild on the streets and you're going to be looking at new veins to hit when you go out the door, but in here (the recovery cells), that just kind of stops.”
 Mosely said the conversation in the Recovery Cells is more focused on their future plans and what they want to do in recovery.
 “It's just not like other cells, it's really peaceful. We find a little bit of serenity and peace,” she said.
 Blake Gibson, KRRJ inmate, agreed, stating that the outreach has helped him learn to hold himself accountable for his wrong-doing and to be more accepting of others.
 “This class has taught me a lot about who I am as a person. It's showed me ways of how my thinking has been wrong, it's helped me learn how to deal with it and gave me the tools and the abilities that when I do get out of here to be able to work on myself,” said Gibson.
 KRRJ and mentors with the outreach said they believe the cells are working successfully.
 “I think the outreach is doing really well,” said Marcus Lindon, a peer support representative of the outreach. Lindon, a former KRRJ deputy, joined the outreach in March of this year, so he said this has given him insight from both sides, judicial and medical.
 “I do think we've seen success with our females because in that short period of time, we've had people go to rehab and we've had folks that have called back. Those are small steps, it's a lot about just planting seeds and I think that's what we're doing,” said Brewer.
 Many inmates, he said, have been requesting to join the cells, which Brewer said he feels that alone also shows progress.
 “It isn't easy to work with inmates all the time, they're very manipulative, they're going to try things, but we're seeing a change of culture and that's the biggest thing. I'm hoping that going forward, I'd like to add a third cell at some point,” said Brewer.
 KRRJ, said Brewer, is the only jail in the state doing this outreach. Other places, he said, offer Substance Abuse Programs (SAP), but this jail doesn't, so the Recovery Cells were a great step into the future, he said.

Strong sheriff
   
 As a lifelong resident of Alachua County, I had the honor of working for three elected sheriffs in my 32-year law enforcement career at the Sheriff's Office. Each were different in their management styles, but all ushered in a new era of policing.
   
 I found Sheriff Sadie Darnell to be thoughtful, well read and decisive. Sheriff Darnell has ensured agency personnel receive training over and above Florida Department of Law Enforcement mandates, and deputies have all the necessary equipment and training to work in this high-risk field.
   
 Sheriff Darnell has implemented active measures to recruit, employ and promote a diverse employment base that accurately reflects Alachua County's population.
   
 In today's political environment with movements to defund our local School Resource Officer programs and other law enforcement services, a strong, progressive, knowledgeable sheriff is what we need. So please join me in supporting and voting for Sheriff Darnell.

 The county has a chance to elect a new property appraiser for the first time in four decades. This is a highly skilled and important constitutional office being vacated by the retiring Ed Crapo.
   
 There are four candidates running, but only one, Kelly Suggs, is at all qualified to step in and run this vital office. The others all come with agendas instead of the required skills and certifications necessary to effectively perform the duties of appraiser.
   
 The people who live, work and invest in the property of this county deserve the best candidate who can hit the ground running, not take years to try to figure it out. Kelly holds all the credentials required to do an outstanding job. He has also served us as a professional property consultant since his 25-year county appraiser career. His goal is to create a more fair tax role.
   
 Experience matters. Please vote accordingly.

 His commitment to traditional Republican values and his charismatic ability to get things done makes it clear to me Gavin Rollins is the right person for this important job. Please join me in voting for Gavin Rollins on Aug. 18.

 Power to the people
   
 We live in an era where elections can be bought; where the will of the majority is outweighed by the will of the few. If we, as a nation, wish to instill the people's confidence into the sacred agreement of democracy, there must be change.
   
 Tom Wells' platform for Florida's 3rd Congressional District directly addresses these issues that plague our elections. Publicly funded elections, ranked choice voting, ending lobbying and overall transparency within our election process are just some of the many reforms that Wells' plans to ensure the sanctity of our democracy.
   
 It is paramount that such issues are addressed. Before our eyes, the voice of the American people has become diminished in recent years. The sentiment of our people is being muffled out by constant antagonizing from our leaders in Washington D.C.
   
 Let us please return the power to the people. After all, the United States should not be for "I the individual" but rather for we the people.

Mike White told us Wednesday that he has a couple of guitars in his office, but hasn't played them in a while.
   
 He didn't need to.
   
 What he said on a Zoom call for a handful of beat writers was music to the ears of a lot of Gator fans.
   
 Forget the slow, plodding Gators of the last couple of years. No longer will you be able to get to the bathroom and back during a Gator possession.
   
 "Playing fast is in my DNA," White said. "It's what our guys want to do. I know it's what our fans want to see."
   
 Obviously, we don't know WHEN we will see it, but as soon as this Florida team is playing real basketball games, it will be more like a Lamborghini than one of those Ed's discount scooters.
   
 Look, we all understood why White last year had to play slow. He had a point guard who was built that way and the offense went through Andrew Nembhard and Kerry Blackshear Jr. with his awkward running style. Now, when I say we understood Florida's style of play, I am obviously not speaking for the entire Gator Nation, some of whom had to bleach their eyes after watching that team play.
   
 And there are no guarantees that a fast-paced team is going to be successful. It's not going to be old school Loyola Marymount (for the avocado toast generation, you can Google it).
   
 But it has to be more fun to watch. I mean we all knew this was coming because of the changes in personnel. But the music was still pretty sweet Wednesday.
   
 "It's the first time in a while we'll have a high level of speed, quickness, athleticism throughout the whole roster," White said. "We'll be really deep and we look forward to playing fast."
   
 (Was that a harp I heard in the background?)
   
 "I'm convicted to press more, especially early on," White said. "We're going in with the mindset we're going to press more."
   
 (Cue the celestial choir.)
   
 "Offensively, I'd like to play more downhill."
   
 (Somewhere, someone is playing your favorite song.)
   
 Florida basketball last year was hardly a disaster. The Gators were headed to their fourth straight NCAA tournament under White and freshmen like Scottie Lewis and Tre Mann were figuring things out.
   
 But at times it was painful to watch, especially after the expectations going in were so unrealistically high.
   
 "We were overrated last season a little bit and we proved that a little bit," White said. "On the other hand, we were picked second in our league and were one rebound away against Kentucky from being the second seed (in the SEC tournament).
   
 "I really don't care (about where Florida is ranked this preseason.) I just want to max out. I want to grow everybody and max out and eventually win another national championship here as it has been done in the past and has been done in other sports."
   
 First things first. White and his staff have to see what this team looks like in person.
   
 Since the SEC tournament was canceled during Florida's pregame meal at the tournament March 12 and the team flew home, White's in-person relationship with his team has been like so many other coaches.
   
 It hasn't existed.
   
 Instead, it's been Zooms and texts and phone calls. White said that his players are finally "Zoomed out," which means they can join the rest of America missing interaction with humans.
   
 The team is allowed to report on Sunday for voluntary workouts, when they will be eyeballed and weighed and checked for body fat to see who worked hard during the time away and who smells like Doritos. White said he was eager to see the players who come back and that they are just as eager to get to work.
   
 Especially Mann, who was the last player to opt out of the NBA draft and return to school. According to a Tuesday night tweet, he's grown to 6-foot-6.
   
 "I didn't see that," White said. "I hope he's 6-6 but he was pretty good at 6-2."
   
 Even while Florida has to wait for news on the eligibility of Michigan transfer Colin Castleton, it's a thick roster filled with players who can play multiple positions. The preseason rankings won't reflect that this may be a better team than last year's because Nembhard bolted, but it's clear that White is excited about getting back to his roots with this team.
   
 "I think we're really versatile, as athletic a team as I've ever been able to coach and as athletic a team as there has been at Florida in awhile," he said. "We look forward to implementing the stuff we've done before with this team. We could have success doing it.
   
 "These guys have grown a little bit and if you listen to the guys they will tell you they have been working their butts off."
   
 There's that music again.

For years during roundup time, in early October, we gathered together a dozen riders to scour the buttes, ridges, gorges and ravines of the Badlands, 25 miles north of Medora, at the Little Missouri Cattle Ranch.
 Of course, roundup is all about bringing cattle closer to home for the winter for the purpose of doctoring and pregnancy testing cows and then, eventually, separating out the calves and bulls.
 After a dusty day in the saddle it’s not unusual for saddle-sore cowboys and cowgirls to gather together on the front porch of the main ranch house to sip on a cool beverage or two and look at the stars, which oftentimes provide an indescribable astronomical display; especially the Milky Way.

And why was there so much rancour? Because, on the one hand, some northern European member states have long accused southern Europe of failing to carry out necessary reforms to protect their economies from a crisis. But, on the other hand, Spain and Italy, among the hardest hit by coronavirus, accused those northerners of putting in jeopardy the EU project by failing to show solidarity in a pandemic not of their making. Are there any losers or has everyone won? Everyone had to give ground – Spain, Italy, Germany and France must accept less generous recovery grants than they had wanted. Meanwhile, the frugal club – namely Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden – made a major concession by agreeing to grants at all. To grease the wheels of compromise, the “frugals” secured increases in their EU budget rebates, meaning a bigger discount on their contributions to the EU budget.

The Texas Department of Public Safety has released the name of the man arrested in a fatal hit-and-run accident from last Friday.
 James Martin Morris, 57, of Pittsburg, was charged with criminally negligent homicide, DPS Sgt. Jean Dark said.
 Morris was taken into custody at 7 p.m. Wednesday night and is in the Upshur County Jail.
 The hit-and-run wreck killed Frederick Fountain, 38, of Irving. Fountain was taken to a Tyler hospital, where he later died. DPS said Morris left the scene after the wreck that occurred three miles north of Gilmer.
 Morris was the (alleged) driver of a black Dodge Ram pickup was driving north on US Highway 271 North in the inside lane when the driver made an unsafe lane change. The pickup struck a 2008 Ford Crown Victoria, making the Ford cross into the southbound lanes of traffic, according to DPS.
 The Ford was then struck by a 2019 Kenworth truck-tractor and trailer. Fountain was driving the Ford.
 “We truly appreciate the support from the community as we continue to work toward the safety and protection of the citizens of Texas,” Dark said.
