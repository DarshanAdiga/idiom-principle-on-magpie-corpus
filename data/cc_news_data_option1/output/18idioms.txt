While best known for such programs as the Mermaid Parade and the Coney Island Circus Sideshow, Coney Island USA has also been the longtime home of Funhouse Philosophers, a resident theater company devoted to presenting the plays of artistic director Dick Zigun, a Yale School of Drama and New Dramatists trained playwright whose previous works have included Dead End Dummy, Killing Republicans, The Ride Inspector's Nightmare, and last season's show The Education of Al Capone as if Told by Jimmy Durante. In recent years, Funhouse Philosophers has been experimenting with the rock opera format in an effort to make abstract ideas like cosmology accessible via music and parody. Bloody Brains in a Jukebox is the culmination of that long-term exploration. "It is the largest and most ambitious production ever mounted by Coney Island USA," says Zigun. Miller calls it "A sensational sci-fi, horror, noir, campy, over the top, bloody story of desire and salvation," adding "What more could anyone want in a night of theater at Coney Island?"
