Ten people incarcerated in Philadelphia’s county jails are suing the city on behalf of the entire prison population over the pandemic-born conditions behind bars, where more than 120 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus to date.
 The complaint, filed in federal court on Monday by the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and three other legal groups, seeks sweeping changes by the Philadelphia Department of Prisons to better protect the nearly 4,000 people still in its custody.
 If conditions can’t be brought up to the standards of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the plaintiffs are asking a judge to release all inmates who are over 55 years old or have underlying health conditions that make them especially vulnerable.
 City officials report one COVID-related fatality among inmates to date, while 43 correctional officers in the city’s prison system have also tested positive for coronavirus.
 The suit follows similar legal action taken by people incarcerated in Philadelphia’s federal prison, which has yet to report a single case of coronavirus among its roughly 1,000 inmates.
 Allegations in the new complaint mirror those detailed in a recent Billy Penn and WHYY report on conditions inside the city’s jails over the last month, including soaring anxieties about social distancing. People behind bars described overcrowded rooms, or being confined to cells for days at a time while being forced to choose between a shower or a phone call in their small window of time outside it.
 In the suit, plaintiffs say there’s a lack of sanitation supplies, soap and medical care, and that shared phones are improperly cleaned. All of this makes the jail population “uniquely vulnerable” by the overcrowded facilities, the complaint alleges.
 “The current conditions within PDP’s facilities create an extreme risk for rapid, uncontrollable spread of COVID-19 among the incarcerated population, correctional officers, health care workers, and beyond jail walls to the larger Philadelphia community,” the suit reads.
 All 10 plaintiffs are at heightened risk for the coronavirus due to their age or underlying health issues, according to the complaint.
 “You need to make changes that are along the public health guidelines — social distancing, providing soap and cleaning supplies,” said Su Ming Yeh, director of the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project, one of the legal advocacy groups behind the suit. “If that’s not possible, and it very well may be, then the best thing to do to protect the individuals is to release them.”
 The city has reduced its prison population by 17% over the last month, and the court system is now ramping up hearings for emergency motions to reduce bail and lift detainers for certain nonviolent offenders, including those who are in custody for technical parole violations.
 Officials have maintained that sanitation supply lines are adequate, but Philadelphia Managing Director Brian Abernathy acknowledged the complaints about the cramped conditions.
 “It is difficult if not impossible to social distance within [the jails] — we recognize that,” Abernathy told reporters Monday. “We are doing what we can to… follow guidelines to make sure inmates and staff are protected given the difficult living situation.”
 The new federal complaint, filed in the U.S. Eastern District of Pennsylvania, also includes allegations of inadequate medical screening among inmates.
 Saddam Abdullah, a 29-year-old plaintiff incarcerated at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center, reported experiencing multiple symptoms that could have been the coronavirus — including chills, cough and loss of smell and taste. Yet because he showed no fever, he claims he was never sequestered from the general population.
 “He had not just one but three symptoms, and that situation was not properly addressed,” Yeh said.
 The plaintiffs also claim that the current situation “exacerbates the disproportionate impact the virus has had on people of color,” who make up 88% of the incarcerated population at the four facilities on State Road. As of early April, African Americans also made up a disproportionate share of the fatalities linked to COVID-19 in Philadelphia.
 Philly-based law firms of Dechert and Kairys, Rudovsky, Messing, Feinberg & Lin are also representing the plaintiffs in the proposed class action case.

How to Protect your Mental Health during the COVID-19 Outbreak
 The COVID-19 outbreak and physical-distancing measures have really changed all of our lives. The current climate of anxiety, stress and isolation may be especially harmful to your well-being. Here are some tips to help prevent this unique time from derailing your mental health and well-being.
 1) Maintain a routine
 If you’re not used to working from home, you may find the transition challenging. Creating a new teleworking routine will help you get into the right mindset, feel more productive and keep the boundaries between work and home from blurring.
 It may be tempting to work into the night and sleep in. A regular bedtime and waking schedule will help you be the most productive. Try to make the time to shower and dress in the morning, and keep normal working hours if you are not required to be on-call.
 Designate a work area. Even if you are quarantined in a small area, you can set up a home office on a snack tray in a corner. If you normally watch TV or scroll through social media while sitting on the couch, you may get distracted if you try to work from the same location.
 If you are homeschooling your children, it can be helpful to work in blocks of time. It may be easier to do schoolwork in blocks of time, rather than for specific subjects. Also, don’t feel like you have to cover all subjects every day. You’re doing the best you can.
 2) Take reasonable precautions, but don’t go overboard
 Use only reliable sources of information such as the Oregon Health Authority or the Center for Disease Control, to help inform and make a plan for your health habits. Wallowa Memorial Hospital also provides regular updates on their website wchcd.org. If you find yourself feeling more anxiety after watching the news or scrolling social media, work to set a time limit for these things each day.
 3) Find ways to keep moving
 Now more than ever, it’s so important to tend to your own health. If you are prone to depression, you might be finding it harder to get out of bed in the morning, motivate yourself to accomplish chores or get started on a work project. Exercise is an excellent stress-reliever and mood-booster. Getting out for a walk and some fresh air can be so helpful, as long as you keep your distance from others.
 4) Stick to consistent meal times
 Sticking to consistent meal times, rather than stress-snacking throughout the day, can also help you maintain your mental and physical equilibrium. Nourish yourself with healthy foods. However, it’s also perfectly fine to build in some comfort foods, like freshly baked cookies. Now is not the time to start a restrictive diet.
 5) Be kind to yourself
 To ease feelings of isolation, acknowledge your own struggles by treating yourself with kindness rather than self-judgement. Try to recognize that millions of people world-wide are sharing in your experiences right now. We are all in this together.
 6) Follow your regular mental health treatment plan
 Make sure you have an adequate supply of medication and take it as prescribed. Continue with therapy appointments.

 Typically, at this time of the year, business is steady and chickens are still in the field and up for grabs. But, amid the pandemic, Vaughan said his new customer base has increased by 300 percent and all of his existing stock has been nearly cleaned out.
 “We’ve sold all of our pork products and have no whole birds left,” Vaughan added. “We are down to our homemade broth, necks and feet because demand has been so high and is increasing every week."
 With limited stock, Vaughan worked to replenish his stock. With 300 chickens in the field nearly ready for market, he offered a reservation system for folks to purchase ahead of time. Of the reserved stock, he said almost all of them have been claimed.

The Kearney School District Education Foundation volunteers had all the wheels in motion for what they hoped would be another wonderful year for their biggest fundraiser, Rise and Shine for Kids. With the event originally scheduled for April, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, it swept away so many of those plans. (There would be) no community gathering, no celebrating the talents of students, no public recognition of teacher’s efforts and no official goodbye to the two individuals that built this event from the ground up.
 The virus may have stopped the event, but it won’t stop us from honoring the amazing community members who give in so many ways.
 First, we must thank our sponsors who donated more $15,000 despite the event being canceled. We emailed each sponsor a form to start the process of returning their donations, but they answered with a resounding, “Please keep the funds.”
 As those email responses flew back in, I must be honest, my eyes filled with tears. The trust this community places in KSDEF to use those funds to assist our school district is both an honor and humbling.
 The funds from Rise and Shine with our invested funds allowed for the largest grant to date to Kearney School District for technology needs to assist with our new world of long-distance learning.
 At Rise and Shine this year, we hoped to share a special moment with the community where we could all honor two of the founding members of the foundation. Thank you, Dr. William Nicely for your passion for the Kearney School District and your vision for KSDEF. After viewing the growing community support through the annual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot, he knew another event was possible. He contacted the former chair of KSDEF, Susan Woehrman, with an idea of a community breakfast. With the help of Dogwood Elementary School Principal Janelle Nelson, who has served as the board secretary of KSDEF, they started groundwork for the breakfast six years ago. In 2019, Rise and Shine for Kids was a sold-out event that garnered over $25,000 in funds.
 Nicely and Nelson are retiring at the end of this school year. They each leave behind an enduring legacy to our community with the strong foundation they have created at KSDEF. We thank them for their talents, drive and endless outside hours volunteered to KSDEF.
 How did we get those invested funds for grant requests from the school district? It started with a $50 deposit 10 years ago with the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation that supports small community nonprofits with investment opportunities. Through your support of Rise and Shine for Kids, the Turkey Trot, KSD’s staff generated Pay it Forward program, the Bulldog Debit Card from Citizens Bank and Trust and other generous donations, we built up a rainy day fund to ensure that when an emergency need was there for our students and teachers, funds would be available.
 KSDEF is proud to be the booster club for academics for the school district, and we remain committed to full-steam ahead for years to come. Our website, www.ksdef.com, Facebook and Instagram sites will keep you up-to-date on future events. We hope to see everyone at Kearney's 9th annual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot this fall.

Another thing that we can think about with sewage data is, for example, why do we have these discrepancies where clinical cases are so low when this data from sewage saws that they should be high? One of the reasons is obviously that individual testing is limited, so not everybody who is sick has access to a test. Sewage testing could also be accounting for individuals who are asymptomatic or individuals with very mild symptoms. Those are people who aren’t even seeking out testing, but they’re still shedding the virus and they’re still using the toilet — so they come up in our samples.

Lawmakers want to fight climate change, but many of them are taking the wrong approach. Proposals to abandon fossil fuels entirely, like the Green New Deal, are both impractical and expensive.
 Fortunately, we don’t need to ban fossil fuels to reduce carbon emissions. The better approach is to capture the carbon we emit and store it underground, safely away from the atmosphere.
 So-called carbon capture and sequestration (i.e., storage) is at the center of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s new climate plan. Despite reservations from some lawmakers and environmental activists, this plan could garner bipartisan support.
 Carbon capture has been around for decades, though only on a small scale.
 In the most common approach, known as “post-combustion” capture, power plants burn fossil fuels like coal and natural gas to create electricity, which releases carbon dioxide as a by-product. Rather than letting that carbon dioxide enter the atmosphere, plants can capture it and transport it, usually via pipeline, and store it deep underground.
 In a newer approach, known as “precombustion” capture, power plants can remove carbon dioxide from fossil fuels before they burn them. Both processes capture an estimated 80 percent to 90 percent of the carbon. But while precombustion costs less to operate, post-combustion is easier to retrofit on older power power plants.
 And other innovative approaches are in the works. For companies that don’t actually produce much carbon but want to play a role in reducing it, there is “direct air capture,” an emerging technology that seeks to remove CO2 directly from the air rather than where it is produced.
 There are currently 19 carbon capture facilities operating worldwide, which, along with facilities under construction, have the capacity to capture 40 million metric tons of carbon each year. That’s a small portion of the 5.1 billion metric tons of carbon released in the United States alone. But these facilities show that carbon capture works.
 And thanks to technological improvements, carbon capture is more cost- effective than ever. Today, it costs between $48 and $109 to capture a ton of carbon using conventional capture methods.
 Unfortunately, progressive lawmakers and many environmentalists dislike carbon capture because it supports the use of fossil fuels. They would rather ban oil and natural gas and transition entirely to renewable energy sources.
 That isn’t feasible. Fossil fuels supply nearly 63 percent of electricity generated in the United States. Meanwhile, wind power provides just 7 percent of that energy, while solar supplies less than 2 percent. Even if we had enough wind and solar power to meet energy demand, the United States would need 900 times our current energy storage infrastructure to keep the lights on when wind and solar couldn’t provide it.
 Some conservatives balk at the idea of using subsidies and tax breaks to encourage carbon capture. That’s a valid concern, considering how much money the government has wasted on failed green energy projects. But with plans like the Green New Deal gaining popularity, McCarthy’s proposal is the most fiscally responsible option lawmakers have.
 Many lawmakers want to take action on climate change, but they need to realize that eliminating fossil fuels doesn’t make sense. Carbon capture is a reasonable, bipartisan climate plan that both recognizes fossil fuels’ importance for economic growth and national security, while actually reducing atmospheric carbon levels.

 OTTAWA--The historic closure of the Canada-U.S. border appears to have stopped the flow of asylum seekers into Canada, with fewer than 10 people turned back to the U.S. in the month since the shutdown to all but non-essential traffic went into effect.
 Public Safety Minister Bill Blair provided the update to the House of Commons Monday, the same day the Immigration Department released new figures suggesting prior to the closure the number of asylum-seekers entering Canada was actually higher in the first three months of this year than last.
 So far in 2020, the RCMP have intercepted 3,035 people crossing between official entry points, up from 2,698 in the first three months of 2019.
 Last month, the RCMP apprehended 955 people, but were unable to immediately say how many were stopped prior to the March 21 implementation of the unprecedented deal to shut the border.
 But Blair called the measures in that deal to block the asylum seekers "effective."
 "Since the time of that agreement, now 30 days ago, there have been fewer than 10 individuals who have crossed the border and been subsequently directed back to the United States," Blair told the House of Commons.
 Earlier this month, the Canada Border Services Agency said that between March 21 and April 2, six asylum-seekers were directed back to the U.S.; it was not immediately clear whether more have tried to arrive since.
 Last month, 930 of the 955 intercepted were in Quebec, at the best known among the unofficial openings in the Canada-U.S. border, called Roxham Road.
 People use unofficial border points to get around Canada's agreement with the U.S. that governs asylum claims. The agreement states that with few exceptions, people aren't allow to request refugee status upon arrival at land border crossings in either country.
 The agreement is predicated on the belief that those seeking asylum must do so in the first safe country they arrive in, and both Canada and the U.S. have agreed they are each safe and so refugee seekers can file their requests in either.
 But the Liberal government has been under pressure for years to amend the Safe Third Country Agreement, partially in response to changes in U.S. immigration policy that critics say render that country effectively unsafe for refugees.
 As a result, some argue asylum-seekers should just be allowed to request refugee status at land border crossings rather than make potentially risky trips, while others say anyone who crosses irregularly shouldn't be allowed to request status at all.
 As the COVID-19 pandemic began to take hold in North America, opposition parties reiterated those demands, but also began raising questions about whether asylum-seekers were being monitored for health risks in the same way as other travellers coming into Canada.
 The Liberals originally had planned to screen and then potentially quarantine the border-crossers, a plan no longer required once the border shutdown was put in place.
 The border was supposed to reopen on Tuesday but the shutdown has been extended for another 30 days.

Scattered in storefronts and light industrial buildings around Los Angeles are gallery exhibitions trapped in suspended animation. The fully installed shows had opened — or were about to open — when California’s governor issued a stay- at-home order on March 19 and now sit in the dark, under lock and key until the COVID-19 pandemic abates.
 At L.A. Louver in Venice, two exhibitions in limbo feature painstakingly detailed works by L.A. painter Tom Wudl, inspired by a key Buddhist text, and more than a dozen never-before-exhibited paintings by the late Don Suggs, works that turn broad swathes of color into impish beings.
 Across town, at Charlie James Gallery in Chinatown, realist paintings by Long Beach-based artist Narsiso Martinez portray farm laborers on grocery store produce boxes — works that come at a moment in which the pandemic has thrown the risks of farm work into stark relief.

There are caveats: Someone can test negative one day and then positive the next. Much depends on the level of virus and whether the swab picked up enough of it to make a good sample.
 The FDA recently authorized the first genetic test that uses saliva, rather than a nasal swab, but its availability is limited for now.
 U.S. testing continues to be squeezed by huge demand, limited testing machines and shortages of key supplies like swabs. While the U.S. is now conducting well over 1 million tests per week, most experts say that number will need to increase at least threefold before social distancing is dramatically eased.

 For instance, that might involve changing from a "diet" mindset into one focused more on long-term strategies, said Truby, particularly when it comes to nutrition. Considering that the Mediterranean model fared so well here, the researchers suggest that could be the eating plan with the most staying power in terms of maintaining weight loss and cardiovascular benefits.
 National dietary guidelines in any country are failing to resonate with the public, Truby said, and this study shows that diets--and particularly those that have numerous restrictions--are less helpful in the long run than focusing on healthy eating basics like eating more vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, and limiting your amount of sugar, salt, and alcohol.

Renovations are well underway at Indian Hills’ Centerville campus as the baseball and wrestling team will be enjoying some updates to their facilities.
 Upgrades to the facility include a new weight room, baseball clubhouse, public restrooms, laundry facility and some storage.
 The north side of the multipurpose building has been gutted is under renovation with the majority of work coming from in-house staff.
 They will have new lockers and a small kitchenette area in the clubhouse. In the weight room, there will be new weights and cardio equipment. There will also be new metal on the outside of the building and there will be windows added to the north side to provide some natural lighting into those areas of the facility.
 Baseball, wrestling, employees and the general student population will be able to utilize the weight room space.
 The school hopes that most of the work will be completed by mid-June but with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, completion could be pushed all the way back to the end of August when students return to campus.
 The Indian Hills wrestling team will still use Centerville’s wrestling room for their inaugural season but IHCC athletic director Brett Monaghan says they could have their own room on campus in the near future.
 “We are working on a plan for a wrestling facility on campus,” Monaghan said. “That planning isn’t complete at this point, so I don’t have much I can pass on until we have things finalized.”

 Another of SSE's founding partners, Gary Drummond, has taken over as the group's lead spokesperson. The third member of the founders' group is Bruce Bowser.
 LeBlanc could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday afternoon, however, in a statement released by the Senators he referenced his work with the NHL's Arizona Coyotes, an extensive sales background and the fact he has long been a Senators fan as motivations for taking the position.
 "I am confident that my experience in the NHL, as well as my sales and marketing background in the technology sector, will be put to good use here in the National Capital Region."

Iowa’s first case of a prison inmate testing positive for COVID-19 has been confirmed at the Iowa Medical and Classification Center in Coralville.
 The Iowa Department of Corrections said Saturday that the inmate is a new admission to IMCC, and arrived at the facility from Henry County on April 16.
 As part of IMCC’s efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, all new admissions to the facility are kept quarantined for 14 days of observation. While in quarantine, the inmate began displaying symptoms consistent with COVID-19, the DOC said in a press release.
 Medical staff tested the inmate for COVID-19, which was resulted in a positive finding. The inmate is now in medical isolation, and state officials say they are performing contact tracing to identify any inmates or staff who may have been exposed since the inmate’s arrival at IMCC.
 The inmate is described as an adult, age 18 to 40, who was sentenced to prison for drug crimes. The inmate is in stable condition, but is being monitored by IMCC’s medical staff around the clock.

So far in 2020, the RCMP have intercepted 3,035 people crossing between official entry points, up from 2,698 in the first three months of 2019.
 Last month, the RCMP apprehended 955 people, but were unable to immediately say how many were stopped prior to the March 21 implementation of the unprecedented deal to shut the border.
 But Blair called the measures in that deal to block the asylum seekers "effective."
 "Since the time of that agreement, now 30 days ago, there have been fewer than 10 individuals who have crossed the border and been subsequently directed back to the United States," Blair told the House of Commons.
 Earlier this month, the Canada Border Services Agency said that between March 21 and April 2, six asylum-seekers were directed back to the U.S.; it was not immediately clear whether more have tried to arrive since.
 Last month, 930 of the 955 intercepted were in Quebec, at the best known among the unofficial openings in the Canada-U.S. border, called Roxham Road.
 People use unofficial border points to get around Canada's agreement with the U.S. that governs asylum claims. The agreement states that with few exceptions, people aren't allow to request refugee status upon arrival at land border crossings in either country.
 The agreement is predicated on the belief that those seeking asylum must do so in the first safe country they arrive in, and both Canada and the U.S. have agreed they are each safe and so refugee seekers can file their requests in either.
 But the Liberal government has been under pressure for years to amend the Safe Third Country Agreement, partially in response to changes in U.S. immigration policy that critics say render that country effectively unsafe for refugees.
 As a result, some argue asylum-seekers should just be allowed to request refugee status at land border crossings rather than make potentially risky trips, while others say anyone who crosses irregularly shouldn't be allowed to request status at all.
 As the COVID-19 pandemic began to take hold in North America, opposition parties reiterated those demands, but also began raising questions about whether asylum-seekers were being monitored for health risks in the same way as other travellers coming into Canada.
 The Liberals originally had planned to screen and then potentially quarantine the border-crossers, a plan no longer required once the border shutdown was put in place.
 The border was supposed to re-open on Tuesday but the shutdown has been extended for another 30 days.

Facebook has come under fire as groups organizing anti-stay-at-home protests have popped up all over the platform. Stone said Facebook would take down posts created through the Facebook Events feature that promote events in California, New Jersey and Nebraska. Other Facebook posts, including Facebook groups about the protests, might not be removed.
 Alyana Alfaro Post, a spokesperson for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, told CNN that the governor's office and Facebook had been communicating about the issue but said, "The governor's office did not ask Facebook to remove pages or posts for events promoting lifting the provisions of the governor's stay-at-home order."
 One event, which is being promoted on the platform, is due to take place in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Monday.

Cast your mind back to what you were doing last New Year’s Eve. If you’re like me, you might have a hard time remembering those joyful times after sheltering inside for weeks under the miasma of the virus-induced storm.
 But I’m going to reminisce a bit in an effort to paint a before-and-after picture of the stock market in early 2020. The idea isn’t to frighten investors but to inspire them to look forward with a grain of hope rather than a dumpster full of dread.
 Things were looking good for the markets at the start of the year. While there were some weak spots, the Canadian stock market chalked up big gains since the crash of 2008 and the longer-term numbers were solid.
 Story continues below advertisement
 The Canadian stock market, as represented by the S&P/TSX Composite Index, climbed by an average of 6.4 per cent annually from the close of 1994 to the close of 2019. Canadian bonds posted solid returns over the same 25-year period with the S&P Canada Aggregate Bond Index climbing by an average of 4.2 per cent annually. (All of the returns herein include reinvested distributions and are adjusted for inflation, which is the propensity for the purchasing power of the dollar to lose value over time. They do not include taxes, fund fees, or trading frictions.)
 Many investors would be eager to sign up for 6-per-cent real returns. But the gains came with alarming crashes along the way that seemed to be unprecedented at the time.
 The good and the bad can be seen in the accompanying graph, which reverses the typical view of long-term returns. The graph plots the final return of a dollar invested at various points in the past. The pre-crash lines represent returns through to the end of 2019 while the post-crash line tracks the results through to the close of April 15, 2020. (The bond line didn’t change much from pre-crash to post-crash.)

The word tragedy does not begin to do justice to the horrific news out of Nova Scotia.
 There are at least 19 people dead following the despicable killing spree conducted over the weekend by 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, who was himself shot dead.
 This toll exceeds the 14 killed during the Montreal massacre in 1989, which makes this the deadliest event of its kind in Canadian history.
 Canadians are now mourning alongside the family members of the deceased. The identities and stories of the victims are slowly coming out in the news and on social media. We celebrate their lives while mourning their loss.
 The first identified victim was RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson.
 While most people rightly run away from such scenes of carnage, Stevenson was one of those brave women and men in uniform who have pledged to run towards danger. This is just what she did Sunday morning while responding to the active shooter incident.
 She was a 23-year veteran of the force and a mother of two. Canadians express their deepest gratitude that Stevenson made the ultimate sacrifice in working to keep us and our families safe.
 "Heidi answered the call of duty and lost her life protecting those she served," said Assistant Commissioner Lee Bergerman. Another RCMP officer was also hurt, receiving a non-life threatening injury.
 Whenever a law enforcement officer leaves their home to start their shift, they are leaving knowing that they may not come back. We must never forget this and always be grateful for the work they do.
 As we mourn, we are also left asking "why?" The motive of Wortman, a denturist, remains unknown. Sometimes a motive is never discovered.
 It is only natural for people to aim to understand why a serious crime has occurred in their community. The RCMP must err on the side of full disclosure in reporting on the developments in this heinous case.
 Canadians of all walks of life have already been facing tough times due to the coronavirus measures in place across the country. This just left the nation reeling in even more pain.
 We are all united behind both Nova Scotia during this tragic occasion.

The end was supposed to include one last run at perfection. One final salute to the judges. One lingering wave to a packed arena followed by a group hug with her Oklahoma teammates, preferably atop the podium at the NCAA women’s gymnastics championships.
 Instead, the end of Maggie Nichols’ remarkable career arrived quietly in the middle of an otherwise routine practice a month ago. One minute, the 22-year- old senior and native of Little Canada was working on the beam preparing for a homecoming meet in Minnesota. The next, coach K.J. Kindler was telling the Sooners their season was over due to the pandemic.
 In an instant, Oklahoma’s shot at a third national title in four years vanished. So did the opportunity for one the most important athletes of her generation — in ways that stretch far beyond the competition floor — to say goodbye on her own terms.
 “I felt wiped,” Nichols told The Associated Press. “I was so devastated. I’ve done gymnastics my whole life. Having it cut short in the snap of two fingers. ... It still doesn’t feel real.”
 Nichols is trying to remain upbeat. She’s incapable of doing otherwise.
 The cancellation came after Oklahoma’s final home meet against Michigan, a night in which she posted the high score in all four events. Nichols clutched roses while bidding an emotional farewell to the crowd at Lloyd Noble Center, the place where she rediscovered her passion for a sport that frequently takes more than it gives.
 The smile on her face provided a sharp contrast to the uncertainty she felt when she came to Oklahoma in the fall of 2016, drained emotionally and physically from years in the exacting crucible that is competing at the elite level for USA Gymnastics.
 Nichols’ steady performance in the team finals at the 2015 world championships helped power the U.S. to a gold medal. It’s a performance made all the more remarkable considering the turmoil going on just beneath the surface.
 Like other national team members at the time, Nichols was frequently treated by national team doctor Larry Nassar. Though she felt “uncomfortable” almost from her first encounter with Nassar, she kept quiet for months.
 “I was 15 years old,” Nichols said. “I was driving to make a world championship team. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t know. Once I realized what he was doing was wrong. I never wanted to see him again.”
 In June 2015 she mentioned her concern over Nassar’s behavior to a teammate. Her coach overheard the conversation and passed Nichols’ concerns to the hierarchy at USA Gymnastics. A scandal that has rocked one of the marquee programs of the U.S. Olympic movement was born.
 Five years later, Nassar is serving essentially a life sentence after pleading guilty to sexual assault and child pornography crimes. USA Gymnastics, the USOPC and Michigan State are still trying to emerge from the the fallout after hundreds of athletes said they were abused by Nassar under the guise of medical treatment.
 The reckoning Nichols helped start has spread to other disciplines like wrestling and swimming. The ripple effects of becoming “Athlete A” still leave her breathless.
 “It has empowered so many different athletes, male and female,” said Nichols, who dropped her anonymity in January 2018 to help encourage other Nassar survivors to speak up. “I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me in saying ‘Because you came forward, I was able to come forward.’”
 Not that becoming the face of a movement was ever part of the plan. Four years ago, Nichols was in the mix to make the 2016 Olympic team until a knee injury slowed her progress. She finished sixth in the all-around at the Olympic trials and didn’t crack the top three in any event. She was named a non- traveling alternate. The pain lingered when she arrived at Oklahoma that fall.
 “I didn’t want to go into the gym,” Nichols said. I wasn’t enjoying it as much. My body was struggling.”
 The team-oriented college atmosphere changed everything. The breezy confidence the athlete whose Instagram pages asks you to “Call Me Swags” returned.
 So did her dominance. Nichols captured 11 NCAA trophies, including the all- around title in 2018 and 2019. She and other Nassar survivors were presented with the Arthur Ashe Award at the 2018 ESPYs. That same year she became the first gymnast to be given the NCAA Inspiration Award.
 Has she ever thought about what might have been if she hadn’t gotten hurt in early 2016? Of course. Do her supporters wonder if her role in exposing Nassar played into the decision to keep her off the Olympic team? Yes. Nichols, however, insists she wouldn’t change any of it.
 “It’s been incredible,” Nichols said. “I’ve enjoyed every second of my college career. Even though I wasn’t as famous as girls that made the Olympic team, I’ve been able to use platform I do have, even if it’s not as big.”
 It’s a platform that would have likely gotten one last boost if the Sooners were spending this weekend in Fort Worth, Texas, attempting to defend their NCAA title. The pandemic put a halt to any fairy-tale ending.
 Then again, maybe in a small way, it’s fitting. Turning disappointment into triumph has become kind of her thing.
 She plans to enroll in graduate school next fall, take a stab at being a volunteer assistant coach and try to land an internship that will let her break into sports broadcasting. Asked if there’s one thing she regrets, Nichols joked she wished she’d have known that her last turn on beam was, well, her last turn ever. Maybe it would have been a little cleaner.
 Otherwise, she is at peace, her legacy secure in ways she never imagined.
 “I feel like people are going to remember me as both the gymnast and also Athlete A ,” she said. “I think I left my mark on both sides. I think people, they’re going to remember the impact I made on gymnastics and sparking a light on something so terrible.”

Hundreds of protesters lobbying to ease Gov. Gavin Newsom’s tight stay-at-home orders rallied around the California Capitol on Monday, even as Newsom continued to urge restraint, saying the worst thing state leaders could do is “make a decision that’s based on politics and frustration.”
 He outlined his approval for some counties to gradually relax some restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.
 Newsom said he approved a plan by Ventura County in Southern California to reopen golf courses and parks, which on Monday prompted the top health official in neighboring Los Angeles County to implore residents not to flood those locations as warmer temperatures arrive this week and bring with them the lure of parks, beaches and other outdoor places.
 “There is a cap in terms of the loosening,” Newsom said, praising Ventura County officials for consulting with his office before their announcement. “They do not go beyond those state orders.”

A new _Resident Evil 3 Remake_ mod called 'Dino Evil 3' aims to give Capcom fans waiting on a Dino Crisis remake something to hold them over.
 It's a little silly turning a corner to a narrow hallway and finding a T-rex snarling in your face, but despite being a mod still in an early testing phase, the animations are pretty well done. If anything, it's cool to see what Dino Crisis might look like running in the RE Engine.
 Essentially, the mod turns all the zombies in Resident Evil 3 Remake into dinosaurs, but it also makes Jill Valentine look like Regina from Dino Crisis. If your idea of a Dino Crisis remake involves a city in the throes of apocalypse and dinosaurs thrashing around in confined corridors, this might be just the thing you've been looking for.
 You can download the mod by maliwei777, which uses FluffyQuack's mod manager, from _Nexus Mods_. Just keep in mind, as mentioned earlier, it's still in the testing stages and has some noticeable kinks that need to be worked out.
 As for an official Dino Crisis remake from Capcom, we've seen some hopeful indications that something might be in the works, but not an official announcement from the studio. Late last year, _Capcom filed a new trademark for the Dino Crisis IP_. Coupled with an earlier report that _Capcom plans on reviving dead franchises_, there's reason enough to be optimistic about the future of the Dino Crisis franchise.

The governor also urged religious institutions to continue to do their part in helping with social distancing protocol. Kemp urged religious leaders to listen to the advice of the CDC by continuing drive-in and online services for the time being.
 Kemp conceded the reopenings are likely to cause a rise in COVID-19 cases, however he said the state will be able for any sudden surge thanks to increased hospital capacity. State officials will also be keeping tabs on any possible emerging hotspots for the virus.
 The state's announcement comes two days after the Trump administrations hosted a call with Kemp and the governors of Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, Mississippi and Florida over the weekend, which involved discussed approaches for reopening their state's economies.
 Leaders in Alabama and Florida outlined their reopening plans on Sunday. South Carolina too is expected to be reopening retail stores and public beaches on Tuesday.

It is not just screechy protesters who objected to the work of Samaritan’s Purse. When New York thought its COVID-19 caseload would exceed its existing hospital capacity -- fears that were thankfully proven ill-founded -- Graham’s organization considered partnering with the Cathedral of St. John the Divine to add overflow beds in the Episcopal church’s building. The church ultimately turned Samaritan’s Purse away, citing the declining need for beds and the importance of their cathedral “to many different constituencies, including the LGBTQ community.” Gothamist reports that the church “has a history progressive activism” and that it was apparently wary of sullying that reputation unless it was absolutely necessary for it to do so. This, ironically, is a near- perfect inversion of the Good Samaritan story to which that Episcopal church would certainly pledge its allegiance. Instead, it rejects the willing and eager help of an organization that would tend to the sick in the middle of a pandemic because the organization in question happened to believe things about marriage that the Episcopal Church believed until the cosmic equivalent of yesterday. Samaritan’s Purse is unclean, and on that accord the Episcopal church rejects its help, crossing the street like the priest in the parable, unwilling to defile himself and attend to the sick.

While the statewide stay-home order issued by Gov. Parson has been extended to May 3 for nonessential businesses, state legislative leaders plan to return to Jefferson City Monday, April 27, to deal with the state's budget.
 Ahead of their return, representatives and senators from across the Northland discussed their priorities with the Courier-Tribune and whether they had concerns about returning to the Capitol under social distancing recommendations.
 Jon Carpenter
 Rep. Jon Carpenter, a Democrat is House District 15 that includes part of Kansas City in Clay County, said he wants to see leaders talk about the economic fallout related the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “Lots of people are struggling, there are job losses, economic challenges. The number of people dying in Missouri and those families being affected, this is a significant tragedy," he said.
 Carpenter said like any place that will have people gathering amid social distancing, a challenge of returning to the Capitol includes staying healthy while doing the work of the state.
 “If we take that risk, I want to see work on legislation to work on the current situation, not spending time on partisan bills or special interest bills,” he explained. “What we need to be doing is address the coronavirus and the resulting hardship. Those I have spoken with here at home want to see strong economic steps to help workers and families get through this difficult period in their lives. We don't need to return so the majority can work on repealing Clean Missouri.”
 The Clean Missouri amendment was passed by 62% of voters in 2018, but repealing at least part of it in 2020 is a top priority for some lawmakers. The constitutional amendment was billed as a way to clean up politics through campaign contribution caps, limiting the powers of lobbyists and revamping the redistricting process.
 Mark Ellebracht
 Rep. Mark Ellebracht, a Democrat representing House District 17 that includes parts of Liberty, said he's been ready to go back for weeks to deal with the state's budget.
 “We are planning our budget on what we project will we coming in. Most are expecting far lower revenues with so many folks out of work and many businesses doing less business. We know the budget is a big challenge. As always, the budget is a reflection of the legislature's priorities. I'm optimistic that there will be give and take. Hopefully, we will be able to come to some agreements so that the working people in Missouri are taken care of.”
 Ellebracht said he has spoken with several constituents in his district, with some requesting help to file unemployment and others asking about small business help.
 “My constituents are being hurt, but I am hoping that we are all going to be thoughtful in working through this crisis,” he said.
 Noel Shull
 Rep. Noel Shull, a Republican in House District 16 representing part of Kansas City, isn't sure he will head back to Jefferson City next week as he has been helping his wife deal with health issues.
 “I know we have to pass the budget and that is the main thing that has to happen,” he said. “I believe there may be a special session later on. My assistants have been fielding calls, and I know we have also been aiding those filing for unemployment.”
 Lauren Arthur
 Sen. Lauren Arthur, a Democrat in District 17 representing part of Gladstone, Liberty and North Kansas City, said returning April 27 concerns her as she has heard about peak infection dates related to coronavirus.
 “With that, we have a constitutional requirement to pass a balanced budget, but there is a lot we can do to help families at this time,” she said. “We need to be supporting rural hospitals. We can be revisiting laws for unemployment insurance and modernize those. We can look at workers rights and benefits. Most importantly, absentee voting needs to be a topic. We will have elections in June. I hope things will return to normal, but I don't want people to have to make a decision about their health or their right to vote.”
 Arthur said the budget should include relief efforts to help restaurants, breweries and distilleries.
 “Workers are struggling to make ends meet,” she said. “However, I don't want to see the stay-at-home order terminated too early or we could have a longer second order. I am proud of Clay County residents who have stepped up to the plate, helping their families and communities to stay safe and supported.”
 Jim Neely
 Rep. Jim Neely of District 8, a Republican serving parts of Holt, said he thinks it's odd the governor extended the stay-at-home order while the legislative session will resume as scheduled April 27.
 Neely, who is running against Parson for the state's top elected position, said it is better to let healthy people go back to work and keep those who are sick or at-risk under stay-at-home orders.
 "People need to get back to work," Neely said. "People in the nursing homes are good. Some may even be the best they've ever been because fewer people are coming through. Nurses are giving better care. I can't speak to jails or other high population areas, but nursing homes are good. We need to open (the economy) back up."
 Ken Wilson
 Rep. Ken Wilson, a Republican serving District 12 including Smithville, said the extension of stay-home orders from the state disappointed him.
 “I thought it would expire and we would go about our business,” he said. “This whole thing impacts the district. Small businesses are hurt, the economy is hurt. If this order had been lifted and we could all go on about our business, … business could open up. I don't care if you are in District 12, Kansas City or Joplin, it is all the same. Nobody can do any business this way. I'm afraid there will be businesses that will not recover.”
 Though the stay-at-home order has people staying in, Wilson said he supports elected leaders returning to Jefferson City April 27.
 “It remains yet to be seen what our work day is going to look like,” he said. “Are we going to be restricted to our offices? Are we going to be restricted in how many people can be in the chamber to vote? … How are you going to debate if you are the only person on the floor? … I question how efficient and effective our work environment is going to be. That is my only issue.”
 Though he wishes more businesses could open up in some capacity, Wilson said he thinks the state is doing a good job responding to the pandemic, but that the federal government is not.
 “I'm really disappointed in this stimulus thing, all the pork that was put in it,” Wilson said. “All the different programs that were funded that have nothing to do with this virus. All that money should have been redistributed to all the small business loans …. I just think politics have been played throughout this whole crisis, and that is a tragedy.”

DETROIT — A Michigan prisoner who declined to be paroled earlier this year after decades behind bars has died from COVID-19 complications, officials said.
 William Garrison is one of 17 Michigan prisoners who have died from COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, the Corrections Department said.
 Garrison, 60, could have left prison on parole weeks ago. But he decided to wait until September, when he would be eligible for a complete release without the rigors of parole supervision, the Detroit Free Press reported Saturday.
 After nearly 44 years in prison, “he was trying to get free,” said sister Yolanda Peterson.
 Garrison, however, changed his stance during the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 500 inmates in Michigan prisons. The parole board approved his application in March. Garrison died Monday while waiting to see if prosecutors would challenge it, a standard step that can take weeks.
 He was taken to a hospital that same day after another prisoner at Macomb Correctional Facility found him gasping for air, spokesman Chris Gautz said. He said Garrison hadn’t complained to staff about his health.
 It was “unfortunate all the way around,” said Gautz, noting that Garrison could have been out weeks ago.
 Garrison was sentenced to life in prison for killing a man during a 1976 robbery when Garrison was 16 years old. His sentence was reduced to 40 years in January as a result of U.S. Supreme Court decisions making juvenile lifers eligible for release.
 “He was a zealous advocate for himself and for other incarcerated persons. He often helped other individuals with their legal matters,” said attorney Becky Hahn, who helped Garrison get the reduced sentence.

"It's hard enough to get two cops at any other time," Carey said. "If I called for a riot I wouldn't get that kind of response."
 Carey said Maryland State Police were joined by Cecil County Sheriff's Deputies, Maryland Transportation Authority and Perryville police. According to Carey when police arrived they found his staff taking orders and handing those orders -- in plastic bags that were tied shut --over to customers. Customers were in measured lines with proper spacing and staff wore masks and other protective gear.
 In February Gov. Larry Hogan ordered all restaurants that could not offer take out or delivery to close. To stem the spread of COVID-19 Hogan placed a ban on gatherings, which would include the dining rooms of restaurants. Eventually that number shrunk from 250 to 50 to less than 10 allowed in one place. Customers have to order, get the food and leave, or have it delivered.
 According to Spayd, customers were allegedly lingering in the parking lot and around the establishment.
 "We were at Lee's Landing a week ago and we gave them a warning," the sergeant said. With the second offense the owner faces a year in jail and $5,000 in fines if convicted.
 No other tickets or warnings were issued, he added.
 Carey said he has no paperwork indicating he is being charged. He added, Lee's Landing was not even open the Sunday before since it was a holiday.
 Also, Carey said he is trying to keep his employees working, even though it means only making about $2,000 a day and being open three days a week. That $2,000 is a meager fraction of his normal take, he said.
 "I'm selling my 32-ounce drinks for $5, beer for $1 and crab cakes for $10 when they are normally $18.99. I'm trying to give great deals to my customers at this tremendous time," he said.

The Hatsune Miku rhythm game series is coming to Switch next month with the release of Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Mega Mix on May 15.
 Sega confirmed the release date today alongside a new gameplay trailer. If you're familiar with Hatsune Miku games, Project Diva Mega Mix will look familiar, which makes sense since it's largely a celebration of previous games and songs. However, the Switch exclusive is packing 10 new songs, special Joy- Con inputs in the form of Mix Mode, a T-shirt designer, and most obviously, totally updated art which goes for a sleeker, cel-shaded anime look.
 The base game features 100 songs, Sega says, including "a selection of songs never-before-seen in the Project DIVA series." You can preview _the full song list_ on the game's website. It will also receive six DLC packs with six songs apiece. You can get the game and all the DLC songs for $60, while the base game itself goes for $40. Pre-ordering the game will also get you four theme songs from previous Hatsune Miku Project Diva games, pushing the total song list to 140 tracks.
 While you're checking out the song list, why not mosey on over to the Nintendo eShop and _download the free demo_ for Project Diva Mega Mix? This is the first Hatsune Miku game on Switch, so I imagine fans will be interested to see how it plays.
