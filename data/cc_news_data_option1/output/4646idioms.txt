Mark Bodamer, Ph.D, age 62, bravely crossed the finish line of life and entered heaven on Saturday, November 7, due to complications from Parkinson's Disease. Mark was the proud father of Janie, Isaac and Hannah, who along with their mother, Amber Bodamer-Lewis, survive him. His parents, Paul and Judy Bodamer, predeceased their treasured son.      A professor of psychology, Dr. Bodamer is noted for his research involving American Sign Language communication with chimpanzees. Chimps were unique beings for Mark, who inspired many students to look deeper at the relationship between humans and the world around us. He spoke this special langauge starting at Central Washington University's Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute to the Psychology Department at Gonzaga University. Of special importance to Mark was his work, study and joy of life found at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage in Zambia.      A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Mark took to heart the Bruce Springsteen song "Born To Run." He raced as a fierce, and proud, competitor with endless stamina from from high school at St. Ignatius to Marquette to trail runs and ultra marathons across the Northwest's awesome outdoor beauty, including his beloved San Juan Islands. He forged deep and lasting friendships across these many miles. We will miss his heart and soul, charm and kindness to all.      A special thank you to the care provided to Mark by Riverview Retirement Community, Horizon Hospice and Selkirk Neurology. A memorial service will be planned in the future to honor him. This obituary ends as Mark would always say in earnest: "Peace."

For whatever reason, the planned reboot wound up dying in development hell.

 # Minnesota grants key permits for Line 3 crude oil pipeline
 ASSOCIATED PRESS
 MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota regulators granted a stack of important permits and approvals Thursday for Enbridge Energy's planned Line 3 pipeline replacement across northern Minnesota, setting the long-delayed $2.6 billion project on the road toward beginning construction soon.
 The approvals from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Department of Natural Resources clear the way for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue the remaining federal permits, which is expected to happen fairly quickly. The MPCA could then approve a final construction storm water permit that's meant to protect surface waters from pollutant runoff.
 “The MPCA has used sound science and thorough analysis to ensure that necessary safeguards are in place to protect Minnesota’s waters," Commissioner Laura Bishop said in a statement, adding that the certification "requires Enbridge to meet Minnesota’s extensive water quality standards instead of lower federal standards.”
 Environmental and tribal groups have been fighting the project for years. They contend it threatens pristine waters where Native Americans harvest wild rice and that the Canadian tar sands oil it would carry would aggravate climate change.
 “The science is clear that Line 3 would threaten Minnesota’s clean water and set back our state’s progress on climate at a time when we can least afford it," Margaret Levin, director of the Sierra Club's Minnesota chapter, said in a statement that raised the possibility of further legal challenges.
 But Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge welcomed the approvals, saying in a statement that it recognizes that the permit conditions required by the two state agencies “are essential for protecting Minnesota’s sensitive streams and wild rice waters.”
 Line 3 — which runs from Alberta across North Dakota and Minnesota to Enbridge's terminal in Superior, Wisconsin — was built in the 1960s, but it's deteriorating and can run at only about half its original capacity.
 Enbridge says replacing it will allow it to move oil more safely while creating 4,200 construction jobs and generating millions of dollars in local spending and tax revenues. The updated sections in Canada, North Dakota and Wisconsin are already operating. But the Minnesota segment has been working its way through regulatory agencies and the courts for six years.
 Still pending is a court appeal from the Minnesota Department of Commerce, which contends that Enbridge failed to conduct a legally adequate long-range demand forecast. The independent Public Utilities Commission, which is overseeing the project, has rejected that argument several times.
 The administration of Gov. Tim Walz has come under fire from Line 3 supporters for pursuing the challenge; now it faces criticism from opponents for Thursday's approvals.
 “It’s clear now that Gov. Walz’s wish for Line 3 to have ‘a social permit’ was all talk and no action. This is a deeply unpopular pipeline that is a disaster for our climate, and it will be fought every step of the way,” said Andy Pearson, Midwest Tar Sands Coordinator for the climate change group MN350.
 The regional council of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, one of the unions whose members would build the project, said in a statement that it expects construction to begin next month. Enbridge spokeswoman Juli Kellner wouldn't confirm that date but said the company plans to begin construction as soon as it has the final authorization and permits in hand. Construction would then take six to nine months.

 # Lighting up for the Christmas season? Send a picture to the Herald-Dispatch!
 Deb Moldaschel
 The Sleepy Eye Herald Dispatch
 There won’t be many holiday activities to enjoy this coming Christmas season—no concerts, no parties, maybe not even big family dinners. And that’s going to be okay — we need to do all we can to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community.
 But that doesn’t mean we can’t show our love for the season and all it means.
 Maybe this can be the year you decorate your house like never before — inside and out!
 And, if you do, maybe this is the year you send a picture to the Herald- Dispatch!
 We will feature pictures of decorated houses and yards every week, starting with the Nov. 26 newspaper. We don’t have any limit in mind and there aren’t any prizes for the best (well, except fame—there’s that.)
 Will you have the lights all over the place? Or will you have one or two favorite decorations? Would you like to share a picture of your indoor decorations?
 Don’t be shy. Share the beauty!
 Email pictures to dmoldaschel@sleepyeyenews.com or send them by text to 507-227-8458. Include name and address so people can find it when they are driving around looking at lights.
 For the Nov. 26 issue, we need your pictures by Friday, Nov. 20 (we know—that’s before Thanksgiving. We also know some of you just can’t wait.) After that, just send your picture whenever you take it. We’ll get it in the next available spot.
 Come on now—share the beauty of the season with our readers.

The State and County Health Department have set clear guidelines for how schools respond when staff or students exhibit any COVID-19 symptoms. Following those guidelines is critical to our schools remaining open, although it can pose additional challenges. When teachers exhibit symptoms, schools face significant challenges getting substitute teachers when needed. With the decrease in substitute teachers, schools may be forced to cancel in person classes for short periods of time for staff to complete COVID-19 testing, receive results, and symptoms to resolve. We know this can be problematic for many families and schedules. Please know, we will do our best to communicate any program changes as soon as possible to all families.
 The county's return to "Red," however, could potentially impact the schools ability to conduct other school related events / programs. These could include visual and performing arts, athletics, and other student related activities and events. We continue to work closely with NC Public Health to seek guidance regarding what modified events and activities might be allowable in light of recent developments.
