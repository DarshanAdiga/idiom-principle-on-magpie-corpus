Whenever the Hudson and Onsted volleyball teams face off on a court, fans can always expect a solid match.
   
 The two Lenawee County Athletic Association squads are, arguably, two of the best volleyball teams in the county and both the Tigers and Wildcats have plenty of weapons at their disposal, including a pair of former club volleyball teammates who are up there with the best-of-the-best in the county.
   
 Seniors Callie Bauer from Hudson and Mya Hiram from Onsted are two top student-athletes who have already signed letters of intent to keep playing their top sports at the next level, have kept up a friendship since their days on the Hitters YMCA club team years ago that has put them on parallel paths throughout their high school careers.
   
 "I think playing on the same club team when we were younger really helps to have that strong base," Bauer said. "I played with a lot of the Onsted girls, it helps to have that strong base of skills taught, and I think that's why we've grown so much, it really develops when you're young."
   
 Last year, both Bauer and Hiram helped their teams reach new heights, as Bauer helped lead the Tigers further into the postseason than they had gone before, winning their second district championship and their first regional title ever en route to her getting her second Lenawee County Volleyball Player of the Year award.
   
 Hiram on the other hand, was an integral part of that Onsted team that blitzed through the regular season, winning 28 matches in a row out of the gate en route to a program-record 50-win season, a share of the LCAA championship and the Lenawee County championship, ending Madison's three-year streak.
   
 The pair of them have faced each other in volleyball for the past few years, and until Bauer focused in on volleyball, also did on the basketball court, and whenever the pair faced off, the drive of these two seems to find another gear.
   
 "I love playing against her every single time," Hiram said. " Nobody deserves to be a candidate for (Miss Volleyball) as much as she does. I love playing against her because she's such a good player. We used to play volleyball so we've been friends forever, I just love playing against her to see how she does and trying my best at least against her."
   
 In addition to higher stakes due to facing off with a friend and former teammate, both also feel that it was sort of a double-edged sword facing off with the other in terms of knowing how the other thinks.
   
 "It definitely helps that we both know our tendencies," Bauer said, "how we take a certain shot, how we take a certain set, so its probably an advantage to both of us, but it's definitely in our court to play around that, because we both can predict each other."
   
 Hiram found more success on the basketball court, being a multiple All-County award winner in her career for the Wildcats out of the forward position and a place to continue her career after high school, with NCAA Division II Ferris State.
   
 Likewise, Bauer has found a place to continue her academic and athletic career at the next level, at NCAA Division I Western Kentucky University, and in addition to her current successes, is up for the state's Miss Volleyball award this year.
   
 On Tuesday night, it was Hiram and the Wildcats that got the better of Bauer and the hosting Tigers in three sets despite Bauer connecting for a match-high 20 kills and 14 digs, as Onsted's consistency throughout the match was too much for Hudson to overcome, at least for that night.
   
 "We all know its crucial to prepare because we know who the ball is going to go to," Hiram said. "We've got to prepare for defense and being able to dig up the ball. It's all fun and games and then, once you get on the court, that's when you gotta get down and serious and I think we really did that tonight."

Missouri fans got their first glimpse into what strategies Eli Drinkwitz plans to deploy in Saturday's 38-19 loss to No. 2 Alabama.
   
 Despite losing to a legitimate national-championship contender, the Tigers aren't abandoning ship and course correcting after 60 minutes of play.
   
 Most notably, despite playing only two offensive series against the Crimson Tide, Connor Bazelak is still sharing the first-string line for quarterbacks alongside Shawn Robinson, who played every other series of the game on the team's most recent depth chart released on Tuesday.
   
 In breaking down both players' performances, Drinkwitz said he takes the holistic approach in evaluation, not discounting mistakes or over-analyzing what went well.
   
 "You either played good or you didn't and right now nobody played well enough to win," Drinkwitz said. "So, we all got to improve. I didn't coach well enough to win. I didn't call plays well enough to win and at the quarterback position, we have to improve."
   
 Drinkwitz cited Tuesday's COVID-19 news surrounding the Tennessee Titans and Minnesota Vikings, with both teams having to contact trace after the Titans had three positive coronavirus cases, putting both team's games for Sunday in jeopardy.
   
 During a typical season, splitting meaningful snaps at quarterback was an easy way to disrupt a team's rhythm. Playing during a pandemic could severely shift that thought process.
   
 "I'm comfortable playing multiple guys (for) meaningful snaps throughout the season. I don't think this is going to be a typical season like we've ever had before," Drinkwitz said. "... I don't think we have enough data to think that we're going to be able to go through the entire season with one quarterback. And so, ultimately, I think both guys played well. Both guys competed, both guys gave us exactly what we expected them to give us and both guys will get reps moving forward."
   
 Drinkwitz added the plan was to give Bazelak the first series of the second quarter, not a deviation based on not scoring a touchdown with Robinson behind center before that drive.
   
 Bazelak finished the game 7-of-14 passing for 68 yards, while Robinson went 19-of-25 for 185 yards and a touchdown.
   
 In his first start at Missouri, Robinson recorded a completion percentage of 76%, the best by a Tiger quarterback in a debut since Blaine Gabbert completed 75.8% against Illinois in September 2009.
   
 Personnel and depth chart updates
   
 Tiger linebacker Aubrey Miller is the seventh MU player to opt out of the 2020 season, per Drinkwitz.
   
 Miller is the third Missouri defensive player to opt out for this season after defensive lineman Chris Daniels did so a few weeks back and a team spokesperson announced defensive back Chris Shearin's opt out on Saturday.
   
 The offensive quartet of wide receivers Maurice Massey and CJay Boone, as well as offensive linemen Jack Buford and Thalen Robinson have also opted out of this season.
   
 Missouri cornerback Jarvis Ware is day-to-day after suffering a knee injury in the first quarter against Alabama and missing the rest of the game. Drinkwitz is hopeful he can play against the Volunteers.
   
 Drinkwitz added the team had zero positive tests from its Sunday round of testing, with results from a Tuesday morning test and a Thursday test left to go before departing for Knoxville.
   
 In addition to the "OR" staying put with the quarterbacks, no clear starter was named at tight end or left tackle for Missouri.
   
 Against Alabama, Daniel Parker Jr. got the start at tight end and Zeke Powell played every snap at left tackle.
   
 Also competing for playing time at tight end is Niko Hea and Logan Christopherson, while Bobby Lawrence is also on the first-string line at left tackle.
   
 Larry Rountree is now the clear starter at running back, with Tyler Badie slotting as the second-team choice. The duo is still expected to handle the bulk of work from the backfield, with Rountree taking the lead.
   
 On defense, no clear starter was named at one of the defensive end spots between Chris Turner and Isaiah McGuire. Turner got the start against the Crimson Tide.
   
 At middle linebacker, Devin Nicholson and Cameron Wilkins share the first- string line, after Nicholson had it to himself and started against Alabama.
   
 Wilkins took over starting middle linebacker duties after Cale Garrett's season-ending injury last October and held that role for two games before Nicholson took over first-team duties for the last five games of 2019.
   
 After a sack against Alabama, Trajan Jeffcoat was added to the team's depth chart as a second-string defensive lineman behind starter Tre Williams, who also had a sack and forced a fumble on Saturday.

An increase in the number of transfer, graduate and professional students along with a record retention rate helped the University of Missouri notch a second consecutive year of enrollment growth.
   
 The official enrollment figure for the fall semester, 31,105, is 3.5 percent above the 2019 enrollment, another step on recovering from the crash in attendance that followed the 2015 Concerned Student 1950 protests over racial issues on campus.
   
 The retention rate -- which measures the percentage of freshmen who return after their first year in college -- was 89.4 percent, up 1.5 percentage points from the record rate set 2019.
   
 "We've created a lot of supports to try to move those numbers up," university spokeswoman Liz McCune said Wednesday. "When you see change like this, it is not by accident, it is by design."
   
 Figures provided by the university show that there were 5,318 first-time college students enrolled this fall, down from 5,432 in 2019. That decline, however, is more than offset by 257 more transfer students, 217 more graduate students and 60 more professional students.
   
 Black student enrollment rose slightly, to 1,757 from 1,741, but declined as an overall share of students. Hispanic student enrollment grew by 140, to 1,314, while enrollment by international students declined by 22.6 percent, to 855.
   
 In a news release prepared to announce the increase, Provost Latha Ramchand said the university has looked carefully at what is needed for students to move from first-time enrollment to graduation.
   
 "These successes are the result of a systematic and studied approach where we reviewed the challenges that our students faced, identified concrete steps to address these and converted the plan to action," Ramchand said. "I am truly grateful to our faculty and staff who make this happen."
   
 The university has created new scholarships to cover the cost of attending for Pell grant-eligible students and cut costs for dorms by revising meal plans and housing offerings.
   
 Other efforts work to identify individual students having difficulty, the release states.
   
 There is an early warning system called MU Connect used to observing trends early -- such as an individual missing class or scoring poorly on an exam -- so faculty and advisors can offer help. New students are asked to complete a survey to identify challenges such as feeling homesick, overwhelmed or having financial difficulties.
   
 "At the end of the day, we're doing everything we can to give students the resources and the support they need to not just graduate, but to graduate with a meaningful education that has prepared them for success long after they have left MU," Jim Spain, MU's vice provost for undergraduate studies, said in the release.
