 Nebraska voters will soon decide whether or not their state approves commercial casino gaming and possibly its first-ever legal sportsbooks.
 Nebraska Initiative 429 would amend the state constitution to allow “games of chance” at licensed racetracks. It’s joined on the ballot by Initiative 430 and 431, which would create a governing body and gaming tax on the newly legal commercial gaming bodies, respectively. All three need majority approval for casino gaming to pass.

The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will be upgrading its technology for its fleet with the aim of reducing accidents. It plans to introduce collision avoidance mechanisms and anti-drowsiness systems that will provide real-time alerts to drivers, conductors and the control room.
 The technology, said officials, will go a long way in curbing accidents. Anti- drowsiness systems, for instance, are designed to detect a driver’s alertness and can even sound an alarm if the driver dozes off at the wheel. Cameras constantly monitor the driver’s face and retina to detect how alert he or she is.
 A KSRTC official said trial runs using collision avoidance mechanisms were held and deemed ‘satisfactory’. “Such systems are available in high-end expensive cars and it works perfectly well. This will save hundreds of lives and reduce risk and increase our efficiency,” the official said.
 The system comprises cameras and multiple features including warning systems for pedestrian collision, information on vehicles approaching from opposite sides, and distance between vehicles around the bus among others.
 According to sources in the KSRTC, the tender process for implementation of the technology is in the offing and if everything goes as planned, it will be in place within three to four months. “According to our tentative list, around 1,000 buses that will ply at night especially on highways, inter-state buses and those plying ghat sections will get the technology on priority basis,” the KSRTC official added.
 According to Laxman Savadi, Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister, KSRTC spends around ₹100 crore every year on accident compensation and related issues. “It is not only a question of money, more importantly lives are at stake. Our department is in touch with agencies that provide such services and the project will be rolled out soon,” he said.
 The Minister added that once the system is in place, it will provide better safety measures not just for KSRTC employers but also to drivers, passengers and other motorists.
 Another corporation official said: “Such mechanisms will help the KSRTC identify vulnerable spots along the bus route especially in the ghat sections. This will further help us in better management of road markers, traffic signs, lights among other things.”

If anything, paying ransoms could spur it on. There is a reason why many countries do not negotiate with terrorists. Paying ransoms is a short-term solution, but it simply kicks the can down the road by strengthening criminals. That’s especially true for data crimes. A hacker can gain access to millions of individuals’ information, be paid off handsomely by the data owner, and still profit through identity theft and fraud. And because the data owner won’t have informed the victims, they will not be in a position to protect themselves (by ordering replacement bank cards, for example).

But it won’t be in the long run. And as business stays online, business leaders need to increase offline backups, hire professionals to test for vulnerabilities, and ensure that all staff are cyber-aware to secure their systems and data. Meanwhile, countries around the world need to cooperate more to bring these criminals to justice. Given the asymmetric nature of cybercrime (a disproportionate number of criminals are in Russia, China, and Iran, and many victims are in the United States and Europe) this is as much a political issue as it is a law enforcement one. Finally, laws against ransom payments need to be publicly promoted and enforced. Executives who pay ransoms to hackers may be unaware of the criminal nature of their act, and they likely don’t fear prosecution. This must change.

“We want to take a three prong approach here. 1. Yes we want to see a subdivision where someone can build spec homes and after talking to some people, there is a very strong possibility that that may happen. 2. We also have the need for the working blue collar, white-collar approach. The younger generation is not looking for a yard to maintain. They want a nice condo or apartment that is very low maintenance. 3. We also have a retiring generation that is ready to downsize. They do not want the large yard to maintain anymore,” said Morris.
 Fortunately, businesses like Microsoft, the solar farm, and the hospital, bring a sense of safety to the Mecklenburg’s economy. “These are never ending projects right now. We are so lucky to be one of those communities that struggles within the economy may not affect. It may affect some of the industries here by putting a hold on out of state distributions but as far as real estate value and housing needs, it’s almost like a safety barrier,” explained Morris.
 “Towns and local governments are here to provide services. We are here to provide water, sewer, lights, police protection and fire protection and the rule of thumb has always been ‘that’s what we do’. We can’t think like that. We have to run a municipality like we would run a fortune 500 company. The taxpayers are like our shareholders so we have to consider what we are giving them in returning value.”
 One misconception is that new businesses and manufacturers might consider moving there businesses here if property values never grow. Of course the cost of land would be cheaper but the question has to be asked, would the business owners or other employees consider a permanent move to Mecklenburg if their property values never increase with time?
 Morris explained how Mecklenburg’s economy is booming considering the traditional economic slow downs that come with schools opening back up and even election years. “The stock market usually staggers a bit, the housing industry slows down, and everything else seems to slow down in an election year. This year has defied the odds. This is the first time that I can ever remember the economy here booming during an election year. Look around town and you see no houses for sale and realtors are screaming that they need houses. There’s just a different dynamic now. Houses are staying on the market for less than a week before they have full price offers.”
 The biggest challenge that the Business Development Manager faces is continuing to recruit businesses and working with prospects without having anywhere to house their employees. “If someone comes here and wants to bring 200 new jobs to the area, where are they going to live? Some might say that the market will dictate how many houses get built but that is not exactly how it works. It’s not ‘if you build it they will come’, there needs to be a balance.” He continued, “If I recruit an industry and say ‘look how great our community is’, which it is, we have a great small town feel and people really love that, but what do I say when they ask about housing? The contractors are already a year out, handyman services are slammed, electricians and plumbers have more business than they know what to do with right now. We need to focus on finding a solution to this issue and that’s what I’ve been doing with local real estate companies. We are working together to solve this matter so that we can keep growing and bringing more businesses to this amazing community.”

When you’re named after Edgar Allan Poe, your family roots are entrenched in Anoka and your favorite holiday traditions include trick-or-treating and haunted hayrides, it’s a natural destination.
 And if that wasn’t enough, there have been a few supernatural encounters for good measure.
 Twists, turns and creaks have marked the path to becoming a spooky thriller novelist for Allan Evans. Evans’ latest work “Abnormally Abbey” combines more haunts and laughs, just in time for Halloween.
 “It was much more fun than spooky to write it,” Evans said. “I love Abbey and her supporting cast and they made me laugh too. The ending never fails to bring goosebumps when I read, even after a dozen or more times.”
 Evans has turned his passion for writing into a career, first in advertising, then adding author to the list. And for Evans, there’s nothing better than writing something that can get readers laughing and creeped out in equal measure.
 Real-life experiences are combined with a lot of imagination throughout the book, with Evans basing several characters on people he knows. Creating a main character who is a fan of ‘80s music added a bit of fun as well when working songs into the book.
 “‘Abnormally Abbey’ has been through easily a dozen revisions and two name changes,” Evans said. “At first it was called ‘Spooky Girl,’ but along the way, I realized ‘Ghost Girl’ was a stronger title (I love alliteration!). However, Immortal Works already had ‘Grace’s Ghosts’ and ‘Dead Girl,’ and they recommended changing the title to have the book stand out. ‘Abnormally Abbey’ was the result. My first draft originally began with Abbey introducing herself and giving her background, which wasn’t a strong beginning. If the book is about ghosts, let’s put one in the first scene to set the tone! I added an action scene to start the story and then peppered in her backstory throughout the first chapters. The result was a stronger beginning that grabbed from the opening lines.
 “Throughout the revision process, I printed out triple-spaced copies that allowed plenty of room to make notes and changes. I read the entire thing out loud, first to myself and then to others. The goal was to have the writing and dialogue sound natural. After that, I turned to beta readers to get feedback on pacing, character development and the overall story. Throughout the polishing of the revision process, the writing got better, and as the writing got better, a more distinctive personality came out in the writing. The magic truly happens in this process.”
 If parts of the novel read as if they could have actually happened, it’s not a coincidence. And part of the pull of the plot.
 “Ghosts have been a part of my life for a while,” Evans said. “Though I no longer live there, my last house was haunted. … I was sitting at the kitchen table writing when I heard something behind me. Since I was alone there shouldn’t be any noises. Creak. Something was moving behind me in the kitchen. It was a slow creak that sounded like a kitchen cabinet opening ever-so- slowly. I didn’t turn around, but kept writing. Creak.
 “I couldn’t help but shiver as I wondered what could be moving behind me. I really didn’t want to turn around. What if I saw someone – or something? I kept trying to write, but my brain wasn’t having it. Creak. Not again. I could feel my heart thudding in my chest. It was like my heart wanted to pound its way out just to get away from the creaking sound. I knew how it felt. ‘Abbey,’ I tried to call out to my real-life daughter who was upstairs. The word barely made a sound as my throat was so dry that my voice sounded like two tree branches rubbing against each other. Knowing she’ll never be able to hear me all the way upstairs, I had no choice. I was going to have to turn around. I grabbed onto the edge of the table with both hands. Sliding my chair back, I pulled my feet underneath and shakily stood up. Then came the hard part. I turned around. When I turned around, the kitchen was completely empty, but several cabinets were wide open. Cabinets that were not open earlier. I walked around the island, looking for whoever – or whatever – had opened the cabinets. There was no one there. There wasn’t anyone hiding and no sign of anyone being there. Except for the open cabinets. That wasn’t the only time strange things happened or ghosts appeared. It happened so often I could write a book about it!”
 “Abnormally Abbey” is a ghost story to be sure, but also about a young person finding strength.
 Being a spook magnet isn’t nearly as glamorous as it sounds. There’s something seriously wrong with the summer camp 14-year-old Abbey is sent to. It’s not just the troubled kids, or the clueless camp counselors or even all the ghosts – yeah, the ghosts have found her there too – but now there’s a mysterious symbol that keeps appearing at all the worst moments. Abbey is not a happy camper. But she is a fighter and can go from princess to warrior when there’s a mystery to solve. As long as Abbey has her ‘80s music, there’s no one – alive or dead – that’s going to stop her. So, bring on the dead people, spooks and spirits. This girl ain’t afraid of no ghost.
 “It’s very funny as well as being spooky,” Evans said. “‘Abnormally Abbey’ is a ghost story, but it’s also the story of a 14-year-old girl who finds the strength to stand up for herself and become so much more than she ever expected.”
 The genre has become the home of several of Evans’ works, with “Abnormally Abbey” geared toward a younger audience than others. A new adult thriller – “Killer Blonde” will be published in February about a cat and mouse game between a killer and an investigator.
 A fun, and spooky, venture.
 “As the son of Doc Evans, a prominent Twin Cities jazz musician, I grew up surrounded by music, art and literature,” Evans said. “I was named after Edgar Allan Poe, so it probably isn’t surprising I followed the same path. I’ve always been a reader and began writing advertising and marketing professionally, but eventually turned to novels.
 “There’s something about the feeling of getting creeped out that appeals to me. And I love mixing scary with humor. They pair very well.”

Ms Levitt offered carrot as well as stick: Mr Kamani, the chairman, “could become an icon in the industry”, if he and the chief executive, John Lyttle, clean up the company’s act. Its record does not inspire confidence, however. The report found that Boohoo knew of serious problems in the Leicester factories it uses by March 2019, if not earlier. Yet it took the decision to rip up its plans for this year, ordering new loungewear ranges that it correctly predicted would sell well during the pandemic, without any board- level assessment of the risks. Ms Levitt saw no evidence of criminal activity or proof that Boohoo was responsible for Leicester’s high rate of Covid-19. But there is no doubt that the city’s garment workers continued, during the pandemic, to labour in unsafe conditions for illegally low pay.
 It started as a family business. But Boohoo is a publicly listed company that is experiencing rapid growth in the US as well as the UK. Investors should get stuck in, making their own demands of its governance arrangements, and not expect to ride hands-free. Ministers must also come under pressure. Weak regulation is at the heart of the dysfunction in Leicester, as has repeatedly been exposed by parliamentary committees as well as campaigners such as Labour Behind the Label.
 Health and safety, tax and labour market inspectors need resources if they are to monitor conditions effectively, as well as incentives to work proactively together. Unions, too, should increase their efforts in the area. Boohoo’s commitment to reduce the number of its suppliers should make this easier. Currently, there are around 1,000 manufacturers of clothes and textiles in Leicester, with more than 50 people banned from running companies, often following tax violations.
 The risks of inaction are plain, with broken fire regulations among the many issues raised. Minimum wage legislation and safety standards must be enforced. But with action comes another set of risks. The worst possible outcome of Boohoo’s disgrace would be for the retailer to take all its manufacturing overseas. Up to 10,000 people, many of them of south Asian and east European origin, work in Leicester’s clothing and textiles factories. And so the aim of national and local leaders must be to push Boohoo to mend its ways – to adjust its business model so that its famed speed is not at the expense of care and attention.

Closing the Ashram-Nizamuddin section of the Mathura Road for 10 days is the only way to address the chaos at the intersection with Ring Road, Delhi minister Satyender Jain said on Wednesday during a visit to the area after HT reported how the project to decongest one of the busiest junctions of the national capital has instead turned it into a traffic and pollution hot spot.
 The government's view was supported by experts, who said there was no other option, but opposed by Delhi Traffic Police, which is the final authority on road closures, on the grounds that the road in question is one of the city's principal arteries.
 Along with officials from the public works department (PWD) and the Delhi Jal Board, Jain on Wednesday reviewed the state of the area where traffic has been slowed to a crawl at all times of the day, the road surface cratered, and the air filled with dust from open construction material and the crumbling tarmac.
 "Both the functional carriageways on the Bhogal side of the Ashram intersection are in a dilapidated state because there are water pipelines right under them. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) officials have said that every time they repair the water pipelines during the night time, it breaks due to the heavy traffic that starts from the morning. The constant digging and repairing have damaged the road," Jain said.
   
   
 To carry out necessary repairs, the stretch of the road between Ashram and Bhogal will have to be entirely shut, he said. "We will request the traffic police to give permission to the PWD to shut both the carriageways on the Nizamuddin side for 10 days. In 10 days, the water pipelines will be totally replaced and a completely even and paved road will be built. Even the ramp for the proposed underpass will be ready by then. We hope the traffic police cooperate."
 Taj Hassan, special commissioner of police (traffic), however, said it will be practically impossible to close both the carriageways for 10 days. "This is a main arterial road. Closing it fully in the day time will cause a lot of public inconvenience. We had permitted them to close the road for night hours, and we stand by that only," said Hassan, adding that no letter making this request was received till Wednesday evening.
 According to traffic department estimates, about 20% of the 400,000 vehicles that use the Ashram intersection come from or head towards Bhogal. The stretch is also used by people accessing the Nizamuddin railway station from the southern part of the city.
 Experts said there is little option but to close the stretch entirely, especially because of the scale of repairs required to address the problems with the water pipelines. They warned that if the road was not shut temporarily, the problem would not be solved.
 "Water is the biggest enemy of bitumen. The pipelines, in this case, were not at much depth so the top layer of the road will keep breaking if it is not fixed for once and for all," said Dr S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, CSIR-CRRI.
 "What is being done right now is merely a stop-gap arrangement. Allowing heavy and light commercial vehicles and buses on the stretch is worsening the situation. The road should be closed and the people should be asked to take Barapullah instead," he said.
 Velmurugan added that such problems would not have emerged in the first place had the PWD conducted a feasibility study for traffic management during the construction of the underpass.
 The underpass cuts beneath Ashram Chowk and will allow traffic on the Mathura Road to proceed freely once built. But for its construction, a 175-m access ramp is being built on either side of the crossing. This portion is roughly 20m wide, which in the Bhogal direction accounts for two-thirds of the existing road width.
 PWD chief engineer PK Parmar said a 10-day closure will allow the department to finish work on the access ramps and pull back barricades by 1-1.15 metre (about the width of a car). "The intervening night between Tuesday and Wednesday was the first of the three days given to us when the DJB started repairing the pipeline. But, by today afternoon the line broke again and the road was back to square one. Because of such less time given, PWD also cannot do filling and carpeting of the operational carriageways because it takes at least 10 hours for the carpeting to set," Parmar said.
 He added that if permission to close the road completely is not given, the situation is likely to remain the same.
 For now, some of the mitigating measures include the rerouting of Delhi Transport Commission (DTC) buses, which could help reduce surface wear. Jain directed DTC to divert all its buses on the stretch, following which the transporter issued an order.
 "Bus route number 460 operating between Badarpur Border and Minto Road terminal has been diverted to Lajpat Nagar flyover across Modi Mill flyover to connect to Mathura road. Buses on route number 413, operating between Nizamuddin Railway station and Mehrauli have been diverted from Sunder Nagar where they will have to turn right from Subj Bhurj Circle onto Lodhi road and then taking the Lala Lajpat Rai road…" the order said.
 The order also covers the privately run buses under the cluster bus service. In all, 10 bus routes use the stretch.
 A senior official of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which built the underground Ashram Metro station at the same congested area without hampering the traffic much, said the agency always carries out trials before beginning work. "We always get a study done by an expert consultant and plan based on that during the construction phase. We carry out trials and hold public consultation," the official said on condition of anonymity.

Dr. Mark Tabor Robinson Oak Ridge - Dr. Mark Tabor Robinson, 94, of Oak Ridge, passed away on Wednesday, September 30th in the loving arms of his daughter and son-in-law, while holding his best little buddy, Clifford, his adoring 15 yr old Shitzu. Mark was born on June 23rd, 1926, in Oak Park, Illinois. He was the oldest of two sons of Albert William Robinson and Marion Tabor Robinson. Mark was educated at the University of Illinois and Oklahoma State University, where he received his PhD in 1951. He was married to Margaret Elizabeth Dohr Robinson, (Betty) on August 30, 1947 in Stillwater OK. They were married nearly 64 years until "Betty" passed on May 17th, 2011. He was preceded in death by his son, Mark Dohr Robinson, in 1991, and his brother David W. Robinson in 2017. Mark was a Senior Research Scientist in the Theory Section of the Solid State Division, where he worked for 45 years, from 1951 until his retirement in 1996. He moved to Oak Ridge in 1951, spent sabbatical years at Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, UK in 1964-65 and at KFA, Julich Germany in 1971-72, with his family. He was trained as an experimental physical chemist but became interested in computer applications in 1957-58. Mark's most recognized claim to fame is the Discovery of Ion Channeling, in 1962, by computer simulation (along with Ordean Oen). Mark created a computer program which predicted that Ions can travel through spaces (or channel) between rows of atoms in a crystal lattice. His pioneering work led to the simulation program Marlowe which was much used and emulated through the 80s and well into the present time. His interest in computer simulation continued - particularly in sputtering, particle backscattering and radiation damage, right up to his retirement. An International celebration of Mark's achievements (The Festschrift) was held in Gatlinburg TN, in October, 2013. Mark was honored for his many contributions in the field of ion-solid interactions. Mark is survived by his adoring daughter, Susan Kay Robinson Indrebo, (who was Oh, So Proud of him, and referred to him as "Mr. Encyclopedia", as he knew the answer to everything without looking it up), and her husband, Scott Lyle Indrebo of Oak Ridge. He was known as "Opa" to grandsons, Kristopher Indrebo, and Nicholas (Amy) Indrebo, great grandchildren, Everett, Jackson and Haylee, all of Eau Claire, WI. Among Mark's joys was his love of travel. Mark and his wife, Betty, had the opportunity to visit 64 countries on 6 continents, as well as 49 of the 50 United States. Among his favorite travels were Papua New Guinea, Africa, The Galapagos Islands, and Australia. Mark was also extremely blessed to have around the clock nursing care for the past 5 years through the Department of Labor. He was extremely loved and cared for by so many devoted nurses! Thank you to you all! Due to COVID19, a small, outdoor, social distanced Graveside service will be held. Date to be determined. Mark and family request that in lieu of flowers donations be made to Mark's favorite charity The Nature Conservancy. Weatherford Mortuary is handling the arrangements.

He was preceded in death by his son, Mark Dohr Robinson, in 1991, and his brother David W. Robinson in 2017.      Mark was a Senior Research Scientist in the Theory Section of the Solid State Division, where he worked for 45 years, from 1951 until his retirement in 1996. He moved to Oak Ridge in 1951, spent sabbatical years at Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, UK in 1964-65 and at KFA, Julich Germany in 1971-72, with his family. He was trained as an experimental physical chemist but became interested in computer applications in 1957-58.      Mark's most recognized claim to fame is the Discovery of Ion Channeling, in 1962, by computer simulation (along with Ordean Oen). Mark created a computer program which predicted that Ions can travel through spaces (or channel) between rows of atoms in a crystal lattice. His pioneering work led to the simulation program Marlowe which was much used and emulated through the 80s and well into the present time. His interest in computer simulation continued - particularly in sputtering, particle backscattering and radiation damage, right up to his retirement.      An International celebration of Mark's achievements (The Festschrift) was held in Gatlinburg TN, in October, 2013. Mark was honored for his many contributions in the field of ion-solid interactions.      Mark is survived by his adoring daughter, Susan Kay Robinson Indrebo, (who was Oh, So Proud of him, and referred to him as "Mr. Encyclopedia", as he knew the answer to everything without looking it up), and her husband, Scott Lyle Indrebo of Oak Ridge. He was known as "Opa" to grandsons, Kristopher Indrebo, and Nicholas (Amy) Indrebo, great grandchildren, Everett, Jackson and Haylee, all of Eau Claire, WI.      Among Mark's joys was his love of travel. Mark and his wife, Betty, had the opportunity to visit 64 countries on 6 continents, as well as 49 of the 50 United States. Among his favorite travels were Papua New Guinea, Africa, The Galapagos Islands, and Australia.      Mark was also extremely blessed to have around the clock nursing care for the past 5 years through the Department of Labor. He was extremely loved and cared for by so many devoted nurses! Thank you to you all!      Due to COVID19, a small, outdoor, social distanced Graveside service will be held. Date to be determined. Mark and family request that in lieu of flowers donations be made to Mark's favorite charity The Nature Conservancy. Weatherford Mortuary is handling the arrangements. An online guest book can be signed at www.weatherfordmortuary.com.

Stocks closed higher Wednesday after President Donald Trump appeared to backtrack on his decision to halt talks on another rescue effort for the economy.
 Technology companies led the broad gains after Trump sent a series of tweets saying he’s open to sending out $1,200 payments to Americans, as well as limited programs to help airlines and small businesses.
 The tweets late Tuesday came just hours after Trump sent the market into a tailspin with his declaration to halt talks on a stimulus effort until after the election.

If you are a Switch owner with an active Online subscription you can download Overwatch now in preparation for next week's trial. I enjoyed the Nintendo Switch port when I reviewed it last year, but critiqued the lack of cross- progression and the 30 FPS gameplay. Even a one-time account transfer would have been appreciated, and while 30 FPS is fine, it makes the Switch the worst place to play Overwatch competitively. Still, it's Overwatch on the go, and that's more than enough for some fans of the game. Cross-progression (and maybe cross-play) are probably on the table when Overwatch 2 comes out, but for now anyone jumping into next week's trial should go in expecting to start over from scratch.

Closing the Ashram-Nizamuddin section of the Mathura Road for 10 days is the only way to address the chaos at the intersection with Ring Road, Delhi minister Satyender Jain said on Wednesday during a visit to the area after HT reported how the project to decongest one of the busiest junctions of the national capital has instead turned it into a traffic and pollution hot spot.The government's view was supported by experts, who said there was no other option, but opposed by Delhi Traffic Police, which is the final authority on road closures, on the grounds that the road in question is one of the city's principal arteries.Along with officials from the public works department (PWD) and the Delhi Jal Board, Jain on Wednesday reviewed the state of the area where traffic has been slowed to a crawl at all times of the day, the road surface cratered, and the air filled with dust from open construction material and the crumbling tarmac."Both the functional carriageways on the Bhogal side of the Ashram intersection are in a dilapidated state because there are water pipelines right under them. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) officials have said that every time they repair the water pipelines during the night time, it breaks due to the heavy traffic that starts from the morning. The constant digging and repairing have damaged the road," Jain said.To carry out necessary repairs, the stretch of the road between Ashram and Bhogal will have to be entirely shut, he said. "We will request the traffic police to give permission to the PWD to shut both the carriageways on the Nizamuddin side for 10 days. In 10 days, the water pipelines will be totally replaced and a completely even and paved road will be built. Even the ramp for the proposed underpass will be ready by then. We hope the traffic police cooperate."Taj Hassan, special commissioner of police (traffic), however, said it will be practically impossible to close both the carriageways for 10 days. "This is a main arterial road. Closing it fully in the day time will cause a lot of public inconvenience. We had permitted them to close the road for night hours, and we stand by that only," said Hassan, adding that no letter making this request was received till Wednesday evening.According to traffic department estimates, about 20% of the 400,000 vehicles that use the Ashram intersection come from or head towards Bhogal. The stretch is also used by people accessing the Nizamuddin railway station from the southern part of the city. Experts said there is little option but to close the stretch entirely, especially because of the scale of repairs required to address the problems with the water pipelines. They warned that if the road was not shut temporarily, the problem would not be solved."Water is the biggest enemy of bitumen. The pipelines, in this case, were not at much depth so the top layer of the road will keep breaking if it is not fixed for once and for all," said Dr S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, CSIR-CRRI."What is being done right now is merely a stop- gap arrangement. Allowing heavy and light commercial vehicles and buses on the stretch is worsening the situation. The road should be closed and the people should be asked to take Barapullah instead," he said.Velmurugan added that such problems would not have emerged in the first place had the PWD conducted a feasibility study for traffic management during the construction of the underpass.The underpass cuts beneath Ashram Chowk and will allow traffic on the Mathura Road to proceed freely once built. But for its construction, a 175-m access ramp is being built on either side of the crossing. This portion is roughly 20m wide, which in the Bhogal direction accounts for two-thirds of the existing road width.PWD chief engineer PK Parmar said a 10-day closure will allow the department to finish work on the access ramps and pull back barricades by 1-1.15 metre (about the width of a car). "The intervening night between Tuesday and Wednesday was the first of the three days given to us when the DJB started repairing the pipeline. But, by today afternoon the line broke again and the road was back to square one. Because of such less time given, PWD also cannot do filling and carpeting of the operational carriageways because it takes at least 10 hours for the carpeting to set," Parmar said.He added that if permission to close the road completely is not given, the situation is likely to remain the same. For now, some of the mitigating measures include the rerouting of Delhi Transport Commission (DTC) buses, which could help reduce surface wear. Jain directed DTC to divert all its buses on the stretch, following which the transporter issued an order. "Bus route number 460 operating between Badarpur Border and Minto Road terminal has been diverted to Lajpat Nagar flyover across Modi Mill flyover to connect to Mathura road. Buses on route number 413, operating between Nizamuddin Railway station and Mehrauli have been diverted from Sunder Nagar where they will have to turn right from Subj Bhurj Circle onto Lodhi road and then taking the Lala Lajpat Rai road…" the order said. The order also covers the privately run buses under the cluster bus service. In all, 10 bus routes use the stretch.A senior official of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), which built the underground Ashram Metro station at the same congested area without hampering the traffic much, said the agency always carries out trials before beginning work. "We always get a study done by an expert consultant and plan based on that during the construction phase. We carry out trials and hold public consultation," the official said on condition of anonymity.
