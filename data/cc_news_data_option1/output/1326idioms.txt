I didn't, honestly. I didn't really think about it. I felt like they haven't been a part of their show for so long. I talk to Grace, not regularly, but pretty often and she's spectacular and she's on another show [ABC's _A Million Other Things_ ], so I don't even know even if I thought about it if it could have worked out. But if I did that, it would come out of the blue, all of a sudden them showing up and saying goodbye. I really felt like the way the show holds together, the minutes felt very real and very organic. Again, I'm thinking about this in hindsight, if I had thought about that, I wonder if that would've felt wedged in and gimmicky. It's a good question. I wish I was smart enough to have thought about it before. All I wanted to do was do a very honest, emotional goodbye episode.

I really wish my students hadn't begun our first online class March 17 with comments like, "You predicted this, I can't believe it, but you predicted it!" And I sort of had -- I began to track the outbreak of what became known as COVID-19 with the students in my class on "The History and Evolution of Infectious Disease" in the third week of January when it first made science news.
   
 Since then we grew frustrated, increasingly alarmed and then horrified as we watched it unfold like a great train wreck that we were powerless to stop.
   
 And I really wish that students from over 20 years ago weren't reaching out to me now, when they hear echoes of my lectures in the news, or to tell me materials from my course provided arguments to shut down schools, or even to call for statewide shelter in place orders.
   
 These aren't compliments. My students are afraid. They are reaching out to me for comfort and support. They've seen it coming, and they know what may happen next.
   
 They've seen the historic data from the Spanish flu of 1918, and its eerie parallels to COVID-19. They've learned their biology, and understand the difference between infectivity and virulence, linear and logarithmic or exponential, and what it means to "flatten the curve."
   
 They've learned a lot about viruses and about mutation and recombination, and accept the fact that evolution is not just part of some abstract theory. It is embodied in the respiratory systems of people with COVID-19 who can't breathe and then just die.
   
 They've studied the common patterns accompanying outbreaks, the suffering, the loss, the scapegoating and the social upheaval, the kind of extreme damage that tears the fabric of even the most civil societies, and often on a global scale.
   
 Microbes, I remind them, don't care about borders or national boundaries, or even at times the rich or the poor. They can be the great levelers, colonizing our bodies and turning us all into "microbial meat." But they also know that each epidemic in history leaves behind a distinct fingerprint -- a kind of signature, if you will -- that is inscribed in collective memory. Every cruel epidemic is cruel, in its own way, to paraphrase Tolstoy.
   
 They know they can prepare for it, and many have, but they also know that it may be futile, if everyone doesn't do it. PowerPoint slide No. 1, or so, in my class points out the obvious: infectious disease is social, by definition. It takes more than one. It thrives on human interactions and co-dependencies, exploiting a basic human need to be with one another.
   
 We are social animals, after all. And they know that whatever we do to come to terms with it, to fight or to adapt, the microbes will find a way to catch up with us.
   
 "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature," isn't just a catchy jingle from a 1970s margarine commercial. It is the theme of the course, a stern reminder that we aren't as smart as we think, and that we have to rethink what we eat, how we live and how we travel, and to do everything we can to preserve the biodiversity of the planet or what's left of it.
   
 We've already eliminated so much of the life on earth, or made it impossible to thrive; we've turned vast rainforests into giant feedlots, to meet the needs of a growing population of human bodies. We've taken the stunning diversity of life on earth and reduced it to a monoculture, on a global scale, a nearly pure cultivated crop of human bodies.
   
 Is it now any surprise that some virus, some opportunistic parasite, is able to take advantage of what is available, namely us, microbial meat?
   
 We've known all this for nearly three decades, especially at the University of Florida where many of us have been sending warning signs to generations of students of the impending train wreck. Powerless to stop it now, we must do what we can to minimize the damage, try to understand what happened and make sure that it does not happen again.
   
 And needless to say, HIS 3495/ZOO 4926, the History and Evolution of Infectious Disease, taught this fall semester (if I survive) is filled to capacity as of today.

He really said that, didn't he?
   
 "And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers (of projected COVID-19 deaths) we're talking about," The Donald bloviated at a briefing, "that doesn't mean we're going to tell everybody no more driving of cars."
   
 And Trump's not the only one chanting the "we run over people don't we?" chorus. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, piped in. "We don't shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways. It's a risk we accept so we can move about."
   
 Um, no, that's not quite right.
   
 We don't "accept" upwards of 40,000 traffic deaths a year as a necessary price to pay so Americans "can move about."
   
 It is, rather, the blood that we spill so we can drive as fast, as carelessly and as distractedly as we please in our increasingly oversized, overpowered and over-engineered vehicles of choice.
   
 Because that is the autoAmerican way.
   
 Listen, if we're going to be honest about it, "We The People" built that staggering death toll atop nearly a century of bad public policy. Everything from the way we design roads to the way we do land use planning to the way we calculate speed limits -- and then mostly turn a blind eye when drivers routinely ignore them -- all of that and more conspire to keep those death numbers up.
   
 We're all so freaked out about coronavirus, hardly anybody noticed the recent news that, at the at the Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety, in Stockholm, the United States was the only one of 140 nations to refuse to sign a global pledge to eliminate road deaths by 2050.
   
 No surprise there. The feds have zero vision for Vision Zero.
   
 Not that most state or local officials are much better.
   
 StreetsblogUSA reports that, when states sent their fatality reduction goals to the Federal Highway Administration, "18 states explicitly told the federal agency that their roadway fatality target was actually an increase in total pedestrian and cyclist deaths over the previous year."
   
 And, yes, Florida was among them.
   
 Here's more. A recent Boston University survey of American mayors found that 76% believe their cities are "too oriented toward cars," and about 37% think pedestrians and bicyclists are unsafe in their cities.
   
 Nevertheless, 80% believe their speed limits are just right or too low -- and never mind that speed is the number one determining factor in pedestrian deaths.
   
 Again, no surprise. Cities that ticket too many speeders are roundly shamed as greedy "speed trap" operators (ask Waldo). Many states prohibit or restrict the use of cameras to ticket red light runners and speeders.
   
 Just as we know the steps necessary to keep COVID-19 from spiraling out of control, we also know how to drastically reduce highway deaths. Design urban roads with safety, not speed, in mind for a start.
   
 The same technology that enables Florida to bill drivers who use the Turnpike without a SunPass could also be deployed to dun motorists who drive recklessly through city streets. But that would make motor voters mad.
   
 If you want to get away with murder in autoAmerica kill a pedestrian or cyclist with your car. The dead can't tell their side, and if your story is convincing enough ("He came out of nowhere, officer!), you may not even get points on your license.
   
 But, sure, let's pretend all those dead people are the legitimate price we must pay "so we can move about."

I think McGarrett has always hit the ground running. We saw him in the pilot come in on a military plane land and hit the ground running, moving, always forward, never looking back. The idea of him leaving the island for a moment and decompress and get re energized and rejuvenated, and hopefully off-screen, I imagine people will hopefully believe that he'll come back at some point and spur a new chapter. Maybe with a family with Catherine and maybe continuing to run the task force. Maybe not as hands on, but the idea was to have him in the Adirondack chairs sitting out with Danny, there's a lot of connected tissue to that first episode. I wanted to show how far everything has come. McGarrett has always suffered from post-traumatic stress. He played that over 10 years and it's finally caught up with him. He needs a little bit of a break. I wanted to play a natural closure that felt real and honest, and I didn't want to manufacture a reason for the show to end. I want it to end on something that we've been building to over 10 years and that felt like the right thing to do.

Despite the pandemic’s chokehold on commerce, wine-related businesses are thinking outside the box to deal with this unprecedented health crisis. With tasting rooms closed since March 17, they’re finding innovative ways to embrace their customers and protect their employees.
 Compline Wine Bar in Napa is shifting gears to reach out to health care professionals with its food to-go orders. Meanwhile, 12 wineries from Santa Barbara to Mendocino counties have pooled their efforts to create “Shelter In Case,” an online offering.
 Finally, Honig Vineyard & Winery in Rutherford and Husch Vineyards in Philo give new meaning to “repurposing.” Resolved to hold on to all their employees, these wineries are retraining them for other duties to keep their salaries and benefits intact.
 Shelter In Case
 The brainchild of Adam Lee, the case of wine coordinates the efforts of 12 different wineries.
 “The idea wasn’t simply to make up lost tasting room revenue, although any revenue now helps,” said Lee, owner and winemaker of Santa Rosa’s Clarice Wine Company. “The idea of Shelter In Case was to bring something different and enjoyable to all of our customers in this difficult time, a case of wine that runs the gamut in style and diversity of winemakers.”
 Lee said the collection of wine also helps Santa Rosa’s Bottle Barn.
 “We know how important brick-and-mortar retailers are to all of our wineries,” Lee said.
 The case, at $469, includes shipping and can be purchased at bottlebarn.com. These are the bottlings: NV Flaunt Sparkling Wine; Idlewild, 2018 “Flora & Fauna” White Wine; Peake Ranch, 2017 Santa Barbara County Chardonnay; Fort Ross Vineyard, 2018 “FRV” Chardonnay; Siduri, 2017 Sta. Rita Hills Pinot Noir; Roar, 2018 Santa Lucia Highlands Pinot Noir; Bucher Winery, 2017 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir; Clarice Wine Company, 2018 Garys’ Vineyard Pinot Noir; J. Cage, 2018 Craftsman Red Blend; Marietta Cellars, 2016 Gibson Block Estate Grown Syrah; Meeker, 2016 Handprint Reserve Merlot and Mantra, 2013 Sonoma Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.
 Lee hopes more wineries will follow suit with unique packages.
 “Cooperation is a good strategy always,” he said. “It was a good strategy when Robert Mondavi would put his (and other) California cabernets in blind tastings with Bordeaux. It was good then and it’s good now. Unfortunately, sometimes we get so caught up in our own sales efforts that we forget that we do more working together than separately.”
 Feeding health care professionals
 With a restaurant license, Compline Wine Bar in Napa can remain open. Now, serving health care professionals is a growing segment of its consumer base.
 “We offer meals for $20 each, and we have grown from 60 meals a day to over 230 a day in one week,” explained co-owner Matt Stamp. “Businesses and individuals have come out to support and sponsor these meals.” (People can sponsor meals at complinewine.com.)
 Compline, founded in 2017, is delivering meals in Napa to Queen of the Valley Hospital seven days a week and to multiple OLE Health facilities three days a week.
 “I think every restaurant is making a lot of very difficult decisions right now,” Stamp said. “For most, delivery/take-out does not pencil out. We are a wine bar and a restaurant, and 90% of our sales are restaurant sales, so the impact is high.”

It was 10pm and I was 50m ahead of her, just this side of Chinchilla [in south-west Queensland], when a guy in his car fell asleep at the wheel and took her out.

HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii Gov. David Ige said Friday he will ask the U.S. military to postpone the world's largest maritime exercises because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ige said at a news conference he would send a letter to Adm. Phil Davidson, the commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, requesting that the Rim of the Pacific drills be postponed \"until the COVID-19 situation here in the islands subsides.” The drills were scheduled to be held in Hawaii during the summer. The U.S. has more cases of the coronavirus than any other country. South Korea and Japan, major participants in the exercise, are also among the countries that have been hard hit by the pandemic. Hawaii has 319 confirmed cases of the disease, an increase of 34 over the past 24 hours. Three people infected by the virus have died in Hawaii while 18 have been hospitalized. In the U.S., at least 277,828 people had tested positive for the disease, according to a tally maintained by Johns Hopkins University. The Rim of the Pacific — or RIMPAC — exercises are held in Hawaii every two years. They brought 46 surface ships and 25,000 personnel from 25 nations to the islands in 2018. The exercises began in 1971.

his reference is a favorite meme of Trumpies on social media because it's something that actually happened and it's all they've got so they're running with it. Our doofus mayor as well as some in our city govt. encouraged people to go to the Chinese New Year parade, without fear, including on social media, in order to counter prejudice against Asians about the virus. I'll remind that Mayor Doofus also waited until the last minute to cancel the St. Paddy's Day parade (as well as going to his own gym in Brooklyn.) He's a panderer to the protest of the moment, and identity politics in a deficient manner and very scattered about it to boot. All the better our Gov. is constantly yellin' at him, eyes-on-the-prize style. De Blasio is not exactly the crowing glory of the Empire State, managerially speaking. He's a pander bear but without skill or forethought. In the past he's been clueless fodder for the right. So far what he's been good at is shaking down pay-for-play political donations. Of the coronavirus press conferences I've seen by him, they have not been not reassuring, he sounds like the proverbial chicken with his head cut off. Hopefully someone more competent is actually running this show and one does get this impression if one follows what's up.
