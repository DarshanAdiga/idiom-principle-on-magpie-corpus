Education has become a lucrative business in Kashmir. An education industry has been created for the sole purpose of generating profit. Without commenting on the quality of education, which varies from one institution to another, the private school teachers have been treated as a ‘commodity’ for capital generation. Working below minimum wages and always vulnerable to layoffs, these oppressed workers go on piling money for owners while themselves living miserably from hand to mouth. The pay-cuts and layoffs are more common during prolonged lockdown in valley and now during the Covid-19 crisis many such cases are coming forth. The Covid pandemic has not caused any loss to this business of private schools as hefty fees are being charged from students while the teachers get only peanuts, even going without pay for months in a row. The insensitivity of the owners toward basic human values once again proves how capitalism puts profit over human relations and human dignity. The school owners are not so blind as to see that their establishments are dependent on these teachers, but they take advantage of the availability of ample number of unemployed youth who are ready to work on low wages.

CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - Parents who’ve already made a tough decision to send their kids back to school this fall are now faced with another choice.Are they willing to waive any liability in connection with exposure to COVID in the classroom?Several private school parents have pushed all summer for administrators to return to school in person. Many got that granted, but with the caveat.We’ve seen “COVID waivers” required this summer for extracurricular activities and sports.But now, 19 Investigators have confirmed that many private schools in Northeast Ohio are asking parents to sign one for any student returning to in-person learning this fall.A local catholic school parent sent us a copy of an additional form they were asked to sign this year.It outlines the measures the school has taken to prevent the spread of COVID 19, but also says “the possibility of serious illness and death remains... despite all efforts to reduce that risk.”The Diocese of Cleveland tells 19 News each of its catholic schools will be using the form, and sent us an official copy of it.They call it an acknowledgement, rather than a “waiver of liability”Regardless, it says by singing, parents “accept and assume sole responsibility for any illness acquired while at the school, including possible infection with COVID 19.”School safety expert Ken Trump says the waiver ups anxiety in an already uncertain time.“I just think that it is a bad move in terms of the messaging,” he said. “The waiver sends a message that school officials are not 100 percent confident that they’ve done everything to make schools safe and that they are worried that there’s something missing.”When we brought Trump’s concern to the diocese, a spokesperson said, “I don’t know that parents need to go hiring an attorney,” Trump said. “But, you have to decide whether you are comfortable or not.”19 Investigates discovered, it’s not just area catholic schools under the diocese sending out this type of form.Private school parents in Rocky River were asked to sign a document to “waive and release Lutheran West from any and all liability or responsibility in connection with exposure, infection, and/or spread of COVID-19 related to my student(s) attendance at Lutheran West. In a statement, a spokesperson for Lutheran West said, In Shaker Hieghts, parents signing a similar form are acknowledging that “attending school may pose a risk of infection regardless of measures taken by Hathaway Brown School.”In a statement, Head of School Dr. Fran Bisselle said, The question remains though, is how far schools will go to get a signature on the documents.“Are school officials simply sending the waivers home hoping that parents sign them and send them back and all is well? Or will they actually when push comes to shove, tell parents ‘No. You can’t send your kids to school unless we have this?” Tump said.When we asked the diocese, a spokesperson said quote “If parents are reluctant to acknowledge the document, they are asked to have a conversation with their school leadership.”Some of the forms we’ve seen include a spot for the student themselves to sign.Tump says it's not legally possible for a minor to enter into a legal contract though.In the days to follow, 19 News plans to follow up on the legality of the waivers in genera-- how much protection can they really offer?They may very well be out there, but 19 News has yet to learn of any public schools going back in person and requiring parents sign a waiver.Copyright 2020 WOIO.

Let’s start with what not to do. First off, don’t try to hide that it happened. Strategies such as hiding the existence of the incident or finding excuses to minimize the organization’s responsibility can result in even worse consequences. One example is when Uber paid hackers through its bug bounty program to cover up a data breach incident in 2016. When the incident was publicly disclosed in 2017, it resulted in significant damage to Uber’s reputation, and a $148 million fine from the Federal Trade Commission in 2018. And while many companies trot out the CEO to say “I am deeply sorry for what has happened” or fire the chief security officer, neither acts will likely be much help.

OKLAHOMA CITY -- Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday assigned a criminal justice reform measure to come up for a vote on Nov. 3.
   
 Stitt directed the State Election Board to place State Question 805, which seeks to end the use of sentence enhancements for repeat nonviolent offenders, on the general election ballot.
   
 The only alternative was for Stitt to call a statewide special election this year for Oklahomans to decide the measure.
   
 Advocates for SQ 805 say the question will reduce Oklahoma's prison population and save taxpayers upwards of $190 million over the next 10 years.
   
 "This is a great day for Yes on 805, and for all Oklahomans who know the time is now for criminal justice reform," said Yes on 805 President Sarah Edwards. "Our campaign has great momentum and support from a diverse group of stakeholders. Now it's time to allow Oklahomans who know that our criminal justice system can be better to stand up and make their voices heard, as they have done in the past."
   
 Criminal justice reform advocates are also seeking to build on the reforms implemented by the voter-approved State Question 780, which reclassified simple drug possession and some minor property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. SQ 780 passed with 58% of the vote.
   
 Stitt opposes SQ 805 because it seeks to amend the state's constitution. In a recent address to the Tulsa Regional Chamber, Stitt said he'd rather see Oklahoma's sentencing laws changed through the legislative process.
   
 "This is not the right solution to this problem," Stitt said of SQ 805. "The answer is a thoughtful, well-researched sentencing code that provides consistency and clarity for victims, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges as well as defendants."
   
 Supporters of SQ 805 say they have sought criminal justice reforms through the initiative petition process because Oklahoma's Legislature has repeatedly failed to act on the issue.
   
 Because it is a presidential election year, the November election is likely to have high voter turnout. It's unclear if that may help or hurt SQ 805.

Early morning sunrays woke up everyone, along with the chirping of birds and the sound of water striking the big boulders. Then the best thing happened. The kolhai mountain top was visible for a minute or two, which is a rare scenario, and then was covered by clouds. After finishing our breakfast we started to move ahead. After walking half an hour we found ourselves in another meadow called Sekwas. Usually, Sekwas is preferred for night stay instead of Hamwas. Tents of various colours were pitched everywhere and most trekkers were busy with their breakfast. Sekwas is a valley within a valley because apart from the entrance it is covered with barren rocky mountains everywhere. The closer we were getting towards the lake, the more curious we were becoming. Everyone was ecstatic about having a glimpse of those pristine lakes. Finally, after trekking for almost three hours through ascents and descents, we had our first look at the beautiful and gorgeous Tarsar lake ('tar' means a pass and 'sar' means lake). The exhaustion just went away in a breath. Everyone was over the moon and cried in jubilation. Out came the cameras and mobile phones and the clicking of photos began. There was a calmness and tranquility everywhere. The beauty of the lake mesmerised everyone. Everything looked picture perfect. Here we were at an altitude of 13,000 feet experiencing the true colours of nature. The ripples in the water caused by the gentle breeze makes it an awesome experience. A view one could only dream of, the impeccable reflections of tall mountains, the bluish waters, the crystal clear water and an exhilarating atmosphere. Walking along the length of this lake, the colours changed from blue to brown to greenish as a result of different sun angles. This feature is not seen in any other alpine lake. Almost 5 to 6 different colours were seen by us.
