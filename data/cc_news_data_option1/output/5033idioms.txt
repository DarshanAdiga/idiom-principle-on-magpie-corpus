Nearly eight decades ago, Ganitch's USS Pennsylvania football team was scheduled to face off against the USS Arizona team. As usual, they donned their uniforms aboard their ships because there was nowhere to change near the field. The pigskin showdown never happened.
 The aerial assault began at 7:55 a.m., and Ganitch scrambled from the ship's living compartment to his battle station about 70 feet (21 meters) above the main deck. His job was to serve as a lookout and report "anything that was suspicious."
 He saw a plane coming over the top of a nearby building. Sailors trained the ship's guns on the aircraft and shot it down.
 "I was up there where I could see it," Ganitch said.
 The Pennsylvania was in dry dock at the time, which protected it from the torpedoes that pummeled so many other vessels that day. It was one of the first to return fire on the attacking planes. Even so, the Pennsylvania lost 31 men. Ganitch said a 500-pound (227-kilogram) bomb missed him by just 45 feet (14 meters).
 He didn't have time to think and did what he had to do.
 "You realize that we're in the war itself and that things had changed," he said.
 The USS Arizona suffered a much worse fate, losing 1,177 Marines and sailors as it quickly sank after being pierced by two bombs. More than 900 men remain entombed on the ship that rests on the seafloor in the harbor.
 Altogether, more than 2,300 U.S. troops died in the attack.
 They're why Ganitch likes returning to Pearl Harbor for the annual remembrance ceremony on Dec. 7.

Patriots gathered at noon Monday near the USS Arizona relic at Veterans Park along the Riverfront to remember Billy Edwin Gibson, of Atchison County, and all who perished in the Day of Infamy attack by Japanese military forces Dec. 7, 1941 on Pearl Harbor Hawaii.
 Gibson is entombed aboard the ship that claimed the lives of 1,176 other U.S. Service men mostly comprised of U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps service men. More than 10 percent of the casualties on board were from the four Midwestern states of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska that included 11 sets of brothers. A total of more than 20 sets of brothers did not survive the attack.
 Retired Navy personnel and Benedictine College ROTC students presented a salute during Monday’s Remembrance, and all present pledge allegiance to the United States of America and the American Flag, and sang the National Anthem.
 U.S. Navy, CWO$ James Madden, retired read a presentation about the USS Arizona; Larry Lohman, U.S. Navy, retired, read the names of crew members from Kansas who perished and audience members read the names of crew members who perished.
 The women of St. Mark’s Lutheran Church presented a wreath in honor of all veterans at the relic’s display.

Eight decades and countless falls later, Roelfsema has traded his one-speed Schwinn for a multi-gear Trek. He doesn’t go as fast as he used to — his 94-year-old heart isn’t made to go 20 to 25 miles per hour, Roelfsema said. But Roelfsema still takes to his neighborhood streets most afternoons.

 “Gene is just a really friendly person,” neighbor Patrick Akers said. “He’s always active, always positive. I think it just brings smiles to all our faces to see him riding his bike and challenging the kids to bicycle races. I think he’s the person we all want to be when we’re in our 90s.”

Bollywood movie songs normally dominate India's music charts. But when the coronavirus epidemic put paid to new film releases, it created a huge opportunity for independent musicians to make a name for themselves –- sometimes from their bedrooms.
 Singer Carlton Braganza saw his popularity skyrocket when the country went into lockdown in March, and his phone is now ringing almost non-stop with offers from agents.
 For more than three months, the 48-year-old spent nights performing for an online audience from his small bedroom, gaining tens of thousands of new fans in the process.
 "I performed live every night for 70 days on Facebook, taking audience requests," the Bangalore-based musician told AFP.
 He has clocked up to 1.5 million views on Facebook, with around 125 online shows under his belt.
 His free performances are now paying off, with private bookings and venues lining up as India loosens restrictions.
 Experienced musicians like Braganza are not the only ones profiting from the unexpected pandemic-induced vacuum in India's entertainment calendar.
 Hip-hop artist Palak Parnoor Kaur, who has used a small GoPro to shoot videos inside rickshaws and buses under the moniker 'Lil Malai' ('Lil Cream') since 2018, has also seen an uptick in online followers.
 Her videos focusing on India's millennials and the issues that trouble them struck a chord with young audiences on Instagram and YouTube, with fans praising her for tackling difficult subjects like gender violence.
 "Independent artists fill the empty spot created by Bollywood music with original and organic content that audiences can relate to. Now they are more aware of our existence", the Mumbai-based Kaur told AFP.
 \- Sea change -
 Data from audio streaming platform JioSaavn reveals the sea change that has taken place, with their Top 30 weekly chart dominated by non-film music since the lockdown.
 Until mid-October, the top five songs streamed in India were all non-film tracks, according to the platform.
 The expansion of independent music labels such as the US-based CD Baby and Tunecore into India has made it easier for musicians to release albums online.
 But experts caution that it is only a matter of time before Bollywood claws its way back into the spotlight.
 "Once movies start, audiences might just go back to Bollywood music and non- film numbers will tank," Priyak Dhar, editor of MusicPlus.com, told AFP.
 Many artists are still struggling to make money, despite acquiring social media followers, said Atul Churamani, managing director of music publishing firm Turnkey.
 "Although artists have started online concerts, most of them are free," Churamani told AFP.
 "With coronavirus-led lockdowns, even if artists have views and a huge fan following, there are no offline gigs and hence no revenue."
 \- Social issues -
 But for some, money isn't the main motivation behind their desire to grab the mic.
 Rapper Duleshwar Tandi's furious videos about the plight of millions of migrant workers in India's lockdown went viral in April, bringing the former waiter unexpected fame.
 The videos, shot on a mobile phone in his village in eastern India, attacked the government for its apathy towards the poor.
 "When the lockdown was imposed, my family almost starved as there was no work or money," said the 27-year-old, who raps under the pseudonym 'Dule Rocker'.
 "I started rapping to channel my anger with the governmental system and everyone responded strongly."
 He has rejected offers from the film industry, telling AFP he refuses "to write rap music objectifying women".
 But in a story arc worthy of a Bollywood movie, he is now working on an album for US titan Universal Group Music.
 "I want to bring changes to how society looks at poverty", he said.

“Science tells us limiting gatherings of groups and using face coverings are effective in slowing transmission of this virus,” Gordon said in the news release. "With these actions, we can avoid taking the more drastic step of closing schools and businesses.”
 Previously, Gordon had left decisions on mask requirements at the county level, and 16 counties in Wyoming, including Laramie County, have enacted mask mandates for certain public spaces.
 “I want to thank the majority of Wyoming counties who have taken the lead, and the people who are working hard to protect their friends, neighbors and colleagues by wearing face coverings. They will make a big difference, but it will take time,” Gordon said. "These new orders are meant to support local leadership, and we should all know that in Wyoming these mandates are not about citations, but about caring for others.”
 Like with county-level mandates, the mask requirement announced Monday requires people to wear masks when inside of or in line to enter any retail or commercial business, when obtaining health care and when using public transit. Staff members of those businesses will also be required to wear face coverings when interacting with the public.
 In a press briefing after the orders were announced, State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said COVID-19 is “helping cause the death of people who could’ve had more times with their families,” making it necessary for the state to ask its residents to do the right thing. In total, 280 deaths related to COVID-19 have been confirmed in Wyoming, with 23 of those announced Monday.
 “We are always trying to balance the impact of all our actions, and it has become clear, at this point, that the previous steps have not been sufficient,” Harrist said.

BILLINGS, Montana — Girl Scouts of Montana and Wyoming’s latest opportunity for girls in grades 9-12 is GirlSCOUTS Go CyberStart which works in tandem with CyberStart America. Registration is open now for GirlSCOUTS Go CyberStart. Girls can work at their own pace to solve online challenges that allow them to experience real-world cybersecurity tasks. The program helps girls build industry recognized skills, learn a huge range of cybersecurity topics and prove their skills in code breaking, ethical hacking and password cracking.
 Cybersecurity is a growing risk that companies and individuals face, and it affects every aspect of our lives. Unfortunately, there is a massive shortage of experienced cybersecurity expertise, with millions of cybersecurity jobs estimated to be unfilled in the next few years, according to a press release.
 At the same time, women are underrepresented in cybersecurity and are a minority of leadership roles within the field. Girl Scouts is doing its part to assist in creating a strong future workforce by educating girls about why cybersecurity matters and giving them the skills they’ll need to pursue careers in the field, according to the release.
 Cybersecurity falls within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math pillar; one of four pillars that form the foundation of the Girl Scout Leadership Experience. Whether it’s learning about and earning badges for Cybersecurity Basics, Cybersecurity Safeguards and Cybersecurity Investigator or participating on an all-girl Girl Scout robotics team, Girl Scouts of Montana and Wyoming provides opportunities for girls to gain interest, understanding, and passion for the STEM field.

Enormous stimulus packages to boost post-pandemic growth could worsen global warming with huge investments in fossil fuel activities, an international group of researchers has warned.
 Around $12.8 trillion has been pledged to help companies and households recover from the worldwide crisis, with the G20 group of advanced economies accounting for about $11 trillion of that figure.
 That is roughly three times more than what was promised following the global economic crisis in 2008.
 "This large-scale stimulus spending will shape the global economy for decades to come," according to the Energy Policy Tracker, a group of institutes that compiles data on post-Covid public finance for energy.
 "These decisions could trigger unbearable climate disasters or create a resilient and safe economy powered by clean energy," the group said.
 The project's partners include Columbia University in New York, the Stockholm Environment Institute, The International Institute for Sustainable Development, and I4CE (Institute for Climate Economics).
 They calculate that G20 countries have announced at least $234 billion in public funding of fossil fuel operations, and $151 billion in renewable energy.
 Other issues that complicate matters include regulatory, fiscal and monetary measures that can contradict each other.
 In Canada, for example, money is to be allocated for electric vehicle charging stations and also to support oil companies.
 Germany plans to invest one billion euros ($1.2 billion) in electric vehicles and just as much to renovate diesel-burning lorries.
 India has unveiled support for coal and methanol projects along with funds for electric vehicles.
 Vivid Economics, an advisory group, has studied 23 economic stimulus plans.
 Only five countries or regions presented plans that had positive effects for the climate in its view -- Britain, the European Union, France, Germany, and Spain.
 One-third of the EU's unprecedented 750-billion-euro stimulus plan is slated to go to environmental projects.
 "Most countries are not seizing opportunities for climate friendly recovery," said Joel Jaeger, a researcher at the World Resources Institute (WRI).
 "More support is going to high-carbon activities than to low-carbon activities."
 A prime example is support for airlines, as the International Energy Agency notes that only four out of 30 carriers that are to receive aid must meet environmental conditions.
 The IEA called that "a missed opportunity".
 \- Climate dynamics -
 The United Nations has also voiced concern, notably in the Production Gap Report issued by its environment programme UNEP.
 "Government responses to the COVID-19 crisis have tended to intensify patterns that existed prior to the pandemic," the report noted.
 "Jurisdictions that already heavily subsidized the production of fossil fuels have increased this support, while those with stronger commitments to a transition to clean energy are now using stimulus and recovery packages to accelerate this shift."
 The US administration of President Donald Trump has allocated around $70 billion to fossil fuel activities, the policy tracker says.
 That said, crumbling public transport is also tipped to receive $26 billion in aid.
 But of a total $3 trillion in spending, just one percent is for environmental operations, the WRI says.
 There is nonetheless some hope, as the world's second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases is now mulling a new plan.
 President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to spend $2 trillion over four years on low-carbon infrastructure, for example.
 "What Biden will do depends on Congress," where the balance of power depends on the result of elections for two senators from Georgia in January, Jaeger said.
 Biden will also have some direct say over reforms such as new vehicle emissions standards.
 \- No place for coal -
 Meanwhile China, the world's top emitter of greenhouse gases, approved construction of 17 gigawatts of coal-powered generating stations in the first half of this year, more than in 2018 and 2019 combined, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).
 Based on official US figures, that would be the rough equivalent of 7,000 utility-scale wind turbines.
 "Coal should have no place in any rational recovery plan," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told Chinese university students in July.
 China has pledged to achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2060.
 Jaeger said that a five-year plan due out in 2021 would give a better idea of where China is headed, and also wants to study India's next annual budget.
 "There's still time for governments to change or adjust," he said. "We have more momentum for climate action than we had in years" owing to the US presidential election, plans for carbon neutrality from Japan and South Korea, and a boom in renewable energy.
 Michel Fredeau, an energy specialist at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), said continued reliance on fossil fuels was "a short-term reaction to a global event", and underscored progress made since the Paris Agreement on climate change.
 "We cannot invest more to do the same thing," Fredeau said.
 Investors have gotten the message and are bringing pressure to deal with the risks, he said.
 "Companies are aware of the need to move towards a sustainable model. And states will necessarily be influenced, because they know that their future economies will depend on it."

Further information about presidential pardons can be found on a Justice Department web page. That page explains pardons can only be granted for federal crimes, not state crimes. It also says "bear in mind that a presidential pardon is ordinarily a sign of forgiveness and is granted in recognition of the applicant's acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or release from confinement. A pardon is not a sign of vindication and does not connote or establish innocence." While it has no legal bearing on your guilt, accepting a pardon is often perceived as accepting guilt. But that doesn’t necessarily mean you have to be convicted of a crime before you can be pardoned.

Politicians are concerned that after five weeks of partial lockdown, there has been no decline in the number of new infections. Germany is far from the goal of reducing the number to below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants in seven days. No federal state is currently below par. In the Lower Bavarian district of Regen, which had an incidence value of almost 570 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants on Monday within seven days, pupils of all grades will receive distance lessons from Wednesday.
