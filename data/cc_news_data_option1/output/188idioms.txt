These funds will enable us to focus our efforts on removing impaired driving from the roadways, so motorists can feel safe.”

Australia beat England to win the 2017 final
 Free-to-air television coverage and more viewer-friendly kick-off times than the last World Cup in Australia will also help with engagement, especially if the hosts can go one better than they did in 2017, when England narrowly lost to Australia in the final, and win it for the first time.
 After Great Britain's recent shambolic southern hemisphere tour when they suffered defeats to a Tonga Invitational side and Papua New Guinea in a 4-0 whitewash, expectations have taken a hit.
 And other challenges still remain.
 Organisers need to shift 750,000 tickets compared to in 2013 when England co- hosted with Wales, Ireland and France, and the target was just 500,000. The pressure will be on to avoid the sight of empty stands at some of the less glamorous fixtures.
 Thirty two teams have to be planned and catered for, and there has been some anger that the rugby league hotbed of Wigan has not been chosen to host matches.
 But from the arrival of the newly promoted Toronto Wolfpack into this season's Super League and the franchise's superstar singing Sonny Bill Williams, to the first three-Test Ashes series against Australia for 17 years staged here in the autumn, and the building of a brand new national rugby league centre in Manchester, 2020 is set to be an exciting year for the sport.
 The hope that it helps pave the way for a World Cup that the sport is relying on to provide a timely boost and a lasting legacy. And which will enjoy the first proper milestone of its countdown in front of an intrigued global audience at Buckingham Palace on Thursday.

However, recent advancements in scientific research have shed light on the nutrient profile of cheese, calling it a nutritional food product with proteins. Such growing awareness has ultimately led consumers to buy more cheese products. In some regions, cheese itself is often consumed as a snack. The consumption of cheese triangles, slices, dried pieces of cheese, etc., is very common in regions such as North America and Europe. In a nutshell, the demand for cheese perfectly complements the heavy snacking trend, fuelling the growth of the cheese snacks market.

While I wouldn't claim to personally know what it's like to be a U.S. Army medic these days (or ever), I'm not so sure (at least from the three episodes screened for critics) that realism was actually the objective goal here. Perhaps if we're talking about the ways that the team distracts itself from the horrors not too far away, that sentiment might not be too far off base, but as far as an authentic military experience goes, I don't feel confident that this series will hit the mark with its target audience.

Two Bronx councilwomen have introduced legislation to rename part of 161st Street as "Jeter Street," according to AM New York Metro. The announcement comes just days before the BBWAA discloses the results of its 2020 Hall of Fame balloting on Jan. 21. Yankees legend Derek Jeter, on the ballot for the first time, will be voted into the Hall and could even do so with 100 percent of the vote.
 It appears Jeter will also be honored 180 miles southeast of Cooperstown this year. Running along on the south side of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, 161st street actually intersects with "Rivera Avenue," named after another familiar Yankee Hall of Fame legend, Mariano Rivera.
 "We want Jeter to celebrate the honor here in The Bronx, where he spent his entire playing career," 161st Street Business Improvement District Director Cary Goodman told AM New York Metro.

 Conservative council leader Toby Savage said the authority would formally leave next month.
 Four unitary authorities, South Gloucestershire, North Somerset, Bristol City and Bath and North East Somerset (B&NES) councils, were working together to draw up the plans which included 105,000 new homes.

US dollar accelerates broad-based slide during the American session. US and China sign trade agreement at the White House. The USD/INR pair rose earlier today to 71.10, reaching a three-day high but failed to hold and pulled back. As of writing, trades near 70.70, in negative territory for the day, erasing yesterday's gains. The US dollar triggered the decline on Wednesday. The greenback weakened across the board amid lower US yields and an improvement in risk appetite. Wall Street is at record highs. Data from the US (PPI and Empire manufacturing) was mostly ignored by market participants that are awaiting the details on the US-China trade deal. The signing ceremony is taking place. INR Outlook "The Indian rupee experienced a rocky start of 2020 caused by the increasing geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran. However, the tensions, for now, have subsided somewhat and the INR recovered from elevated levels of 72 seen early January. We expect the INR to continue strengthening against the USD in the upcoming months to levels between 70 and 71", explained Rabobank analysts. By mid-2020 at Rabobank, they expect the USD/INR to slide to 72-73, caused by recessionary risks in the US, renewed trade tensions between China and the US and an underwhelming performance of the Indian economy due to a lack of structural reforms in the past.

Technically speaking, this is U.S.-focused adaptation of an Israeli TV series called _Charlie Golf One_ , and _68 Whiskey_ revolves around a multicultural gathering of Army medics at a base that's referred to as "The Orphanage." Paramount Networks initially billed the show as highlighting characters' self- destructive tendencies and outrageous antics, which were meant to give way to camaraderie and a common, profound purpose. In addition, a "Kafkaesque" descriptor would suggest (if one can get that _Breaking Bad_ episode title out of the noggin) that the series would toe the line between fantasy and reality with a deft precision, infusing a tangible sense of hopelessness within hope, but that's not really what goes down in that show. Instead, we receive another reminder that Kafkaesque is a term that appears to have lost all meaning.

STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) — A rain-swollen lake in rural north Mississippi rose at least a foot overnight, keeping heavy pressure on a dam that is in danger of failing, state and local officials said Wednesday. An inspection of the Oktibbeha County Lake dam on Tuesday led to warnings that it was in danger of failing and recommendations that people in the area evacuate. A breach would affect an estimated 130 properties and nine highways. “There is a still the potential for a dam breach,\" Malary White of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said in an email. A release from Oktibbeha County's emergency director, Kristen Campanella, said the lake level had risen a foot overnight. Mississippi has one of the highest numbers of dams that pose dangers and are in poor or unsatisfactory condition, according to a two-year investigation by The Associated Press. Evacuation was not mandatory but was recommended, Campanella said. She said as many as 25 residents have told law enforcement officials they would consider evacuating if conditions worsen. At least one resident told The Associated Press she wasn't going anywhere. “I’ve been here 30 years,\" Valerie Hogan, 70, said as she sat in a car on a dirt road, less than a mile from the dam. She said she's seen workers making repairs and she's confident it will hold. \"Same lake, same arrangement. It’s no problem.” The dam is an earthen structure with a two-lane road atop it. And traffic was still being allowed on that road Wednesday morning. County engineer Clyde Pritchard said workers have installed four 8-inch siphons to move water from the lake, over a spillway and into a nearby stream. He also said seepage from the lake had loosened soil on the normally dry side of the dam and caused a dirt slide Tuesday. As of...

On 23 January 2019, Mr Guaidó, declared himself acting president of Venezuela, arguing that the election which returned Mr Maduro to power in 2018 had been fraudulent.
 Mr Guaidó and his supporters claimed that the presidency was therefore vacant and invoked an article in the constitution which calls for the Speaker to step in as president.
 Mr Guaidó declared himself acting president and was quickly recognised as Venezuela's legitimate leader by more than 50 countries, including the US, the UK and many Latin American nations.
 Since then, Mr Guaidó and Mr Maduro have been at loggerheads but the latter has maintained a firm grip on the government thanks to the support of the armed forces.
 Earlier this month Mr Guaidó, who was facing an end to his term as Speaker on 5 January, went to the National Assembly to stand for re-election but was denied entry by the National Guard.
 They pushed him back with shields as he tried to clamber over the railings surrounding the building.
