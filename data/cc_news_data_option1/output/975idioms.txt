Ramona Hood is the first Black woman to head a FedEx subsidiary in the company’s 47-year history
 Hood has worked for the Ohio-based company since 1991. She was then a 19-year- old single mother in need of a full-time job while she took classes at night. Starting out as a receptionist working during business hours for Roberts Express, which later turned into FedEx Custom Critical.
 “I wasn’t thinking this was going to be my career and I’d be here for 28 years,” says Hood. “I was a young mother. I wanted a job that had a stable shift that would allow me to do college courses as appropriate.”
 Since then Hood has worked hard to climb the corporate ladder within the company from heading subsidiary FedEx Truckload Brokerage to obtaining an officer position at FedEx Supply Chain in 2016. Later returning to FedEx Custom Critical for an executive position. She currently holds a bachelor’s degree in Business Management from Walsh University and Executive MBA from Case Western Reserve University.
 In her new duties as CEO, Hood is looking to gain useful insight from employees, customers and independent contractors driving for Custom Critical to help take the company to a new level.

And not to mention the drama is juicy, even when it's on a smaller scale. Brian and Monica are wading in the waters of best friendship after meeting at the temple in 7th grade (I can't tell you how accurate this is), and neither of them know how to make a move or take it to the next level, or whether they even want to. Richa and Vishal's moms hate each other enough to potentially sabotage their children's marriage, though the kids seem semi-unfazed by the magnitude of this conflict.

The Rev. Marshall Mitchell, pastor of Salem Baptist Church in Abington, hosted an advanced screening of "The Banker" and then held a discussion with actor and producer Anthony Mackie and director George Nolfi in New York City on March 3.
 Mitchell is no stranger to promoting such projects. According to a 2016 Deadline article, he's a Hollywood audience consultant for Wit PR, the firm that managed the advanced screening.
 Inspired by a true story, the movie recounts the adventures of Bernard Garrett and Joseph Morris, who helped their fellow Blacks by buying homes in white neighborhoods to rent as well as offered loans to Black-owned businesses. They were later convicted of misusing funds from the banks acquired in building their enterprise.
 "The Banker" has Mackie playing Garrett and Samuel Jackson playing Morris. It follows them as the two men devise a scheme to take on the racist establishments of the 1960s. Along with Garrett's wife Eunice, played by Nia Long, they train Matt Steiner, a working-class white man played by Nicholas Hoult, to pose as the wealthy and privileged face of their real estate and banking business. Ultimately, their attempt to break down color lines drew the attention of the federal government.
 The movie raised eyebrows in November when it was unexpectedly pulled from its closing-night premiere at the American Film Institute's annual festival in Los Angeles. Its release was postponed amid sexual abuse allegations against Bernard Garrett Jr., a co-producer and the son of Bernard Garrett.
 “Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention,” the tech giant Apple said in a statement then. “We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.”
 Apple TV+, a subsidiary and a newcomer to the entertainment business, scheduled a limited cinematic release on March 6, and plans to stream it online starting March 20, according to media reports.
 At the March 3 screening, the controversy seemed to have faded into the past as guests were treated to a swanky reception on the upper floor of the IPIC Theater in New York City.
 Mitchell moderated an question-and-answer session with Mackie and Nolfi.
 Nolfi said the production of the film was decades in the making. Although he came into the project just four years ago, the director, whose previous movie included "The Adjustment Bureau" in 2011, said the initial idea started with Garrett 25 years ago.
 The discussion also provided a segue to talk about financial literacy, or the lack thereof, in the Black community, touching on the nuisances that many moviegoers don’t often see in African American films.
 “Only 10 countries on Earth spend more money than African Americans; so we are [potent] consumers,” said Mackie.
 Mackie also encouraged the audience to hold off buying high-end clothes, such as "red bottom" shoes, and taking expensive trips until they have their financial house in order. He urged listeners to obtain some of life's tangible necessities, such as a retirement plan, a home and money in the bank.
 The 2-hour movie, which had a reported budget of $11 million, is directed by Nolfi and a former collaborator Joel Viertel, who helped him with "The Adjustment Bureau," is among the producers. Jackson is listed one of several executive producers.
 It was written by Nolfi, Niceole Levy, David Lewis Smith and Stan Younger from a story by David Lewis Smith, Younger and Brad Caleb Kane.

I could agree with your post if it wasnt for 1 thing as you put it "due to new information becoming available". There is no new info, it's not like the cba was changed. This is no different than other union deals in business that I've seen. A deal is struck and ballots(or in this case electronically) are sent out for vote with info on the deal and when a deadline to submit a ballot is. I get it sucks that people voted without looking into the deal but that doesnt mean their given a mulligan for bot doing their due diligence.

Thankfully, Jamie and Claire (Caitriona Balfe) make it to the town just in time to cut Isaiah loose and send him away while Roger is busy singing songs and drinking whiskey with the residents. The fact that he admits to Jamie that he was relying on his father-in-law to turn up and save the day tells you pretty much everything you need to know about Roger, and it ain't good.

The FBI has apprehended and convicted suspects in criminal cases by analyzing light and dark patches -- wear marks -- along the seams of the suspects' blue jeans.
 A leading proponent of blue jean analysis is Richard W. Vorder Bruegge of the FBI's Forensic Audio, Video and Image Analysis Unit in Quantico, Virginia.
 According to ProPublica, an independent group of investigative journalists, Vorder Bruegge wrote an article in the 1999 Journal of Forensic Sciences on the photographic analysis of denim "trousers" arguing that wear marks create, effectively, a barcode that is unique on every pair.
 "Every piece of clothing that you own is going to undergo abuse during your lifetime," Vorder Bruegge said. "If you're a kid, maybe you're sliding down hills and getting a lot of scrapes on the jeans. Or maybe your jeans get washed and ironed. But you're rubbing them back and forth, and the blue dye is abraded."
 Apparently, Vorder Bruegge believes that those markings can be identified to the exclusion of nearly every other pair of jeans on earth.
 Last year, ProPublica conducted an investigation that revealed FBI examiners have tied defendants to crimes in thousands of cases by using crime scene photographs in unproven ways and, at times, have given jurors baseless statistics to say the risk of error in their analyses was extremely low.
 As a result, Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, computer science professor and leading forensic image analyst, and Sophie Nightingale, a postdoctoral researcher in image science, tested the FBI's method and found several serious flaws.
 In 1998, the FBI's Vorder Bruegge explained continued washing of jeans causes the dye to rub off and exposes the white cotton underneath. Jeans fade in a unique pattern, he said, because in their manufacture, the motion of pulling the jeans through a machine causes inconsistent bumps along the seams.
 Nightingale and Farid sought to test photographic pattern analysis, involving matching crime scene photographs with wear on blue jeans. The researchers bought 100 pairs of used blue jeans from thrift stores and second-hand shops. They photographed the jeans and had images supplied of more than 100 additional pairs of jeans.
 The researchers took photographs of the jeans under various conditions and found a substantial error rate. According to Ars Technica, "this means the technique of matching up jeans is likely to be pretty hit and miss - not catching actual similarities a lot of the time and possibly throwing up a high rate of false alarms. And that's under controlled experimental conditions using high-quality images and jeans laid out nice and flat, not grainy security footage showing jeans being worn."
 Farid told ProPublic, "If you're willing to tolerate that only one in four times this will be useful, OK, fine, use the analysis."
 Last fall, Washington Post Columnist Radley Balko, cited a 1999 Chicago Tribune article to explain the dubious process of blue jean matching. He also suggested that part of the blame lies with his colleague's lack of skepticism - taking the claims of forensic analysts at face value.
 Brandon Garrett, a Duke University law professor who studies the reliability of forensic science, told ProPublica, "This is one of many studies uncovering non-trivial error rates for forensic techniques," he continued, "Any lawyer or any judge in a case involving this discipline should, at minimum, hear about the error rates. Many people assume that these techniques are perfect."
 Judges, lawyers and jurors cannot blindly accept that a new investigative technique lives up to the hype. Just as with journalists, a heavy dose of skepticism is the best practice.

In the meantime, she's still carrying around Mrs. Beardsley's baby, who finds some mother's milk thanks to Brownsville resident Lucinda Brown, who recently had a baby of her own who died. She and her husband are very keen to care for the child, which is rather convenient as the last thing Claire and Jamie need is a baby around. That's not what Jamie wants to hear, of course—his offer to support her in raising the child as their own is sweet, but thankfully Claire has enough common sense in this instance to say that her regret at not being able to raise a child with him isn't a reason to keep the little one. Whew, close call!
