By creating guidelines for representation onscreen, behind the camera, and in future filmmaking generations to come, they’re doing their part to push cinema forward. Time will tell if these guidelines create the type of positive, inclusive change the industry is long overdue for, but one thing is for sure: it’s a step in the right direction.

 # 12 schools in Ventura County approved to reopen for in-person learning
 Shivani Patel
 Ventura County Star
 Twelve private schools have been approved to reopen for in-person learning in Ventura County as of Tuesday morning.
 Ashley Bautista, a county spokeswoman , said the following schools were given the final state approval last week: St. Patrick's Episcopal Day, Ascension Lutheran and Hillcrest Christian in Thousand Oaks; Conejo Adventist Elementary in Newbury Park; Beacon Hill Classical Academy and Pleasant Valley Christian in Camarillo; Grace Brethren and Phoenix Ranch in Simi Valley; Ventura Missionary in Ventura; and Oak Grove in Ojai. Bethany Christian and Carden Conejo in Conejo Valley were the first two schools to receive approval.
 Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a tiered approach to reopening. The tiers are purple (widespread), red (substantial), orange (moderate) and yellow (minimal).
 Schools can only reopen when a county has been in the red tier for two weeks. Waivers provide a way for schools offering kindergarten through sixth grade to reopen despite being in the purple tier, which is where Ventura County is.
 School officials seeking waivers are required to fill out an application form that includes support from labor, parent and community organizations as well as the school's reopening plan.
 The applications must then be approved by both the local and state public health departments for schools to reopen.
 Twenty-three schools have submitted waiver applications, including the 12 approved to reopen.
 The latest schools to apply for waivers are St. Rose of Lima and Good Shepherd Lutheran in Simi Valley, Linda Vista Adventist in Oxnard and St. Paschal Baylon in Thousand Oaks.
 New Harvest Christian School in Oxnard, Revo Academy in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley Adventist School have local approval and are waiting for a response from the state to reopen.
 Besant Hill School of Happy Valley in Ojai, which was originally on the list, has since been omitted because it only offers grades nine to 12.
 Hillcrest Christian in Thousand Oaks had its first day of school on campus Aug. 31 for students in grades kindergarten through six.
 Hillcrest Vice Principal Jessica Navarro explained the school had an exemption to continue with learning on campus through its camp license. Under state COVID-19 guidance, day camps are allowed with safety precautions in place.
 "It’s something that we’ve always been licensed to do; something that we do during the summer," she said.
 The school had been running as a day camp this year during the summer months until Friday when the school received approval for its waiver application.

Kevin Harvick won his eighth NASCAR Cup Series race of the 2020 season and first race of the NASCAR Playoffs at the Southern 500. Harvick collected his second win at Darlington Raceway this season for Stewart-Haas Racing and Ford Performance.      “Congratulations to Kevin, Rodney, and the entire No. 4 crew,” said Doug Yates, President and CEO of Roush Yates Engines. “Kevin and the No.4 crew never gave up and were in position to take the lead at the right time for the first win of the playoffs and our 175th Cup win. "      After battling his car set up for a good part of the race, Harvick found himself in a perfect position to take the lead after Chase Elliott and Martin Truex Jr. tangled and hit the wall in the last stage of the race. Harvick passed Elliott on lap 355 to lead a total of 32 laps. As the laps wound down Harvick defended a hard charging Austin Dillon, holding him off on the last corner to take the checkered flag a mere .343 seconds ahead of Dillon.      “Anytime you can win the Southern 500 is a good day,” commented Harvick. “This is one of the most prestigious races in our sport and this is one of the most prestigious racetracks in our sport, so anytime you can win at Darlington it’s a big deal, but, man, Southern 500!”      Four Ford Mustangs finished in the top-10. Following Harvick was Team Penske’s Joey Logano in P3 and Stewart-Haas teammates Aric Almirola and Clint Bowyer in P9 and P10 respectively.      The NASCAR Xfinity Series also took on the Lady in Black. Chase Briscoe led 55 of the 147-lap race and came in P11 while fellow Ford Performance teammate, Austin Cindric came in P12.      In addition, the Ford Mustang GT4s were back in action in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge Series at Road Atlanta. Seb Priaulx and Scott Maxwell had their best finish of the year finishing on the podium in P2. Fellow Ford teammates from PF Motorsports, Chad McCumbee and James Pesek finished P8.

Aric Almirola, driver of the No. 10 Smithfield Hometown Original Heroes Ford for Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR) in the NASCAR Cup Series, heads to Richmond (Va.) Raceway for Saturday night’s Federated Auto Parts 400 holding down the 12th spot in the NASCAR Cup Series playoff standings. Almirola finished ninth in Sunday night’s playoff opener at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway to earn his second consecutive top-10 at the egg-shaped oval. It was a rollercoaster of a race for Almirola, who fell outside the top-20 before rallying back to a top-10 by the end of the race. “It wasn’t pretty, but we rallied back to have a decent finish that keeps us in contention to advance to the next round,” said Almirola, who’s tied for the all-important 12th-place cutoff spot with SHR teammate Clint Bowyer with two races to go in the Round of 16. “It’s no different than racing at Vegas last year, where we had a seventh- to 10th-place car. We didn’t get the stage points we needed to build a cushion, but to leave Darlington with a ninth-place finish after the day we had was what we needed heading to Richmond.” Almirola needs to remain in the top-12 in points to advance to the Round of 12 for the third consecutive season with SHR, which makes running well Saturday night at Richmond and the following Saturday night at Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway that much more important. The Smithfield Ford driver was in the exact same playoff points position last year heading to Richmond – 12th place with 2,033 points. He went on to advance to the round of 12. Almirola has one top-five at Richmond since joining SHR, but that doesn’t mean he looks at the .75-mile short track as a weak point in his quest to reach the Round of 12. “I really enjoy Richmond,” he said. “It’s a tough track, but it’s in Smithfield’s backyard and would mean the world to lock ourselves in to the next round there.” The No. 10 Ford driver enjoyed a career-best regular season with five top-five finishes, 14 top-10s and 286 laps led. In his last 16 races, he has 12 top-10s and all five of his top-fives. SHR teammate and regular-season points champion Kevin Harvick won Sunday night’s Cook Out Southern 500 at Darlington to secure his position in the next playoff round while SHR’s Cole Custer is just three points behind Almirola and the 12th-place cutoff line. Almirola and his longtime partner Smithfield Foods have collaborated to honor frontline hometown heroes by showcasing a special paint scheme on the No. 10 Ford this weekend. Smithfield looks to honor those who are putting their own health and safety at risk in a selfless act to protect and nourish others around them. The Smithfield “Hometown Original Heroes” program provides the opportunity for fans to share the stories of their own “Hometown Hero.” Be it a nurse, doctor, food worker, public servant or anyone who is on the frontlines each and every day, Smithfield and Almirola want to hear their stories and give. To nominate a hometown hero, visit www.SmithfieldHometownHeroes.com and submit a one- minute video nominating the “Hometown Hero.” Ten heroes will be chosen to have their stories told and will have their names riding onboard the No. 10 Smithfield Ford Mustang at a race during the NASCAR playoffs this fall. The heroes will also receive a VIP race day experience and full-year supply of Smithfield “Hometown Original” bacon. Almirola looks to become Smithfield’s “Hometown Original Hero” this weekend by parking the black, white and gold Smithfield Ford in victory lane with a ticket punched to the Round of 12 for the third year in a row.

Jason Martin scored the winning run in the ninth inning for a 5-4 Pittsburgh Pirates victory Tuesday when catcher Yasmani Grandal dropped a toss home, ending the visiting Chicago White Sox's four-game winning streak.
 Against reliever Ross Detwiler (1-1) in the ninth, Gregory Polanco and Josh Bell singled. Jimmy Cordero replaced Detwiler, and Martin pinch-ran for Polanco. Ke'Bryan Hayes was intentionally walked after the runners advanced on a wild pitch. Cordero got Kevin Newman's short chopper and threw home, and Grandal's error allowed Martin to score.
 Jacob Stallings had an RBI double, Hayes stroked a run-scoring triple, and Newman and Erik Gonzalez each hit RBI singles for Pittsburgh.
 Grandal hit a two-run homer and Yoan Mancada added an RBI single for the White Sox.
 Pittsburgh's Joe Musgrove pitched four scoreless innings. He allowed three hits, struck out five and walked two. Richard Rodriguez (2-2) pitched a scoreless ninth.
 White Sox starter Dylan Cease pitched five-plus innings, giving up two runs and five hits, with two strikeouts and no walks.
 Chicago scored three runs in the fifth. Nick Madrigal doubled off the wall in right with one out. Tim Anderson singled and Madrigal ran through third base coach Nick Capra's signal to stop and was out at home on a play close enough that the White Sox unsuccessfully challenged the call.
 Anderson went to second on center fielder Bryan Reynolds' throw home and scored on Moncada's infield base hit for a 1-0 lead.
 Grandal followed with his sixth homer, to right, to make it 3-0.
 Pittsburgh struck back in the bottom of the fifth. Bell doubled with two outs and scored on Hayes' triple off the wall in right, making it 3-1. Newman's infield single brought Hayes home to close it to 3-2.
 In the eighth, Jose Abreu hit a two-out single to right and raced home on Polanco's misplay of Eloy Jimenez's double to right for a 4-2 lead.
 In the Pittsburgh eighth, Newman led off with a double and scored on Stallings' double to close it to 4-3. Stallings moved to third on a groundout and was replaced by pinch runner Cole Tucker, who scored on Gonzalez's single for a 4-all tie.

Two Canberra Liberals volunteers putting up election signs in Belconnen in the early hours of Tuesday morning have been held up at gunpoint.
 The volunteers were erecting roadside corflutes for Liberals candidate Kacey Lam at the intersection of Owen Dixon Drive and Heydon Crescent in the Canberra suburb of Evatt.
 A spokesperson for ACT Policing confirmed that, at about 12:15am, police attended "a robbery where a firearm had been produced".
 "The victim and another person were on the side of the road when a white sedan approached them," ACT Policing said.
 "One man exited the vehicle and demanded personal belongings before driving off in a Holden Trax, ACT registration YOG72C."
 The car was found burnt out in Sutton, in NSW, on Tuesday afternoon.

 STOCKHOLM, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo rattled home a superb first- half free kick to become only the second male player to score 100 international goals as Portugal outclassed 10-man Sweden 2-0 in their Nations League A Group 3 game on Tuesday.
 Portugal's captain scored with a dipping set-piece effort just before halftime to join Ali Daei, who netted 109 times for Iran, on a century of goals.
 The 35-year-old was a constant threat to Sweden's back line in the early exchanges, hanging on the shoulder of the last defender before bursting forward to beat the offside trap, but Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen was equal to the task.
 That all changed when Gustav Svensson received his second yellow card and was sent packing after a reckless challenge on Joao Moutinho on the edge of his own box just before halftime.
 Ronaldo stepped up and smashed a dipping effort beyond the despairing dive of Olsen and just under the crossbar before breaking into a wide smile as he celebrated with his team mates.
 Sweden were struggling to contain the visitors and Ronaldo struck again in the 73rd minute with another curling, dipping effort, this time from open play, to leave himself just eight goals short of Daei's international scoring record.
 Portugal's Joao Moutinho credited the Swedes for making it difficult for them early on, but that all changed with the dismissal of Svensson.
 "Of course the red card was good for us, we tried to circulate the ball to find spaces, and happily we scored two great goals from Ronaldo," he said.
 With two wins from two games Portugal top Group 3, ahead on goal difference of France, who beat Croatia 4-2, with the Swedes third and the Croatians bottom.
 France meet Portugal in a top-of-the-table clash in Paris on Oct. 11, while Croatia host Sweden on the same date. (Reporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by Ken Ferris and Toby Davis)

 "Suga is likely to adopt a well-balanced diplomatic strategy that won't hurt Japan's relations with its close ally, the United States, and the Chinese Communist Party, as Abe has done for the past several years," the source added.

Después de 15 años de espera, la directora del festival Sarah Hoch expresó su emoción por tener a Lynch como invitado y homenajeado de esta edición del encuentro de cine en el que se presentarán películas icónicas del creador como _Eraserhead  _(1977) y  _Twin Peaks_  (1992).      “Lo hemos estado buscando 15 años. (…) El señor recibió la invitación con mucho entusiasmo y todavía más cuando vio la plataforma virtual”, explicó en conferencia Hoch quien considera será un reto para el cineasta de 74 años adentrarse en la tecnología de realidad virtual.      Según adelantó Sarah, el autor de  _Blue Velvet_  (1986) estará en tiempo real por medio del Aula Virtual que presenta el festival con un personaje en “avatar” que lo representará. A la distancia se le entregará la emblemática Cruz de Plata del festival bajo el lema “¡Más cine por favor!”, así como la medalla de plata de la Filmoteca de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.      “Va a platicar y a compartir su sentir, su carrera y lo que quiera decir. No es una 'master class', pero va haber interacción y una pequeña sesión de preguntas y respuestas con el público y la prensa”, explicó.      Con una modalidad semipresencial, el festival se arriesga en ser uno de los primeros eventos de cine que regresan dentro de la llamada nueva normalidad, situación en que la directora del certamen puso especial atención con respecto a las medidas de sanidad que realizarán para la protección de los asistentes.      De esta manera, el festival se llevará a cabo por medio del espacio virtual, abierto a todo el público, así como en autocinemas, aqua cinemas y algunos cines que contarán con la presencia de algunos directores de las películas proyectadas para responder las preguntas y comentarios del público que los visite.      Este año el GIFF expande sus horizontes, pues además de presentarse en Guanajuato ciudad (capital del estado del mismo nombre) llegará a las ciudades de Silao e Irapuato.      No obstante, este 2020 no estará en la turística San Miguel de Allende por las medidas que la ciudad puso en marcha por la pandemia.      “Nos duele, el festival es de San Miguel y lo sienten suyo de origen. Pero San Miguel ha tenido mucho éxito en el tema del Covid-19, ha sido muy estricto, el Gobierno todavía no abre ciertas actividades y no fue posible que el festival se realizará en este bloque”, comentó afligida la directora.      Entre otras personalidades que visitarán el encuentro, está el director estadounidense Benh Zeitlin, quien tendrá el estreno mundial de su película _Wendy_  (2020) así como el director Conor Allyn y algunos actores de la película  _No man 's land_ (2020).      De 3 mil 44 películas de 127 países recibidas para la selección oficial del festival, fueron elegidas 170 películas en exhibición, 126 filmes en competencia provenientes de 52 países (46 largometrajes y 124 cortometrajes) de los cuales 21 largometrajes y 41 cortometrajes son mexicanos.

When she is written about, Janet Frame is usually Janet Frame, New Zealand's most celebrated author or Janet Frame, the internationally acclaimed author, and Owls Do Cry, a modernist masterpiece, the greatest work ever written by a New Zealander, this country's first great novel. We have, according to CK Stead, "got into the habit of speaking about Frame, not just uncritically, but in hushed and reverent tones". She has reached "mythical status," wrote Elizabeth Allen in an introduction to the Michael King biography.
 Did they both mean, in a good way? As in, rightly so? I am not sure but holding her in such esteem seems perfectly reasonable to me. And based on the proliferation of personal stories, online, about reading her for the first time, it is safe to say that Frame's work means something to every New Zealand writer and reader. What occurred to me, only in picking up Owls do Cry a second time, is that Janet Frame has been a presence in my life before I was either. Pre-sentience, as it were.
 After Foxton, we moved to Palmerston North. The way you simply absorb things as a child, without them ever really being said, I absorbed the fact that a famous writer lived there and also somehow acquired the knowledge that she had red hair, was "mad" or had been mad and was now just a recluse who would not - I remember an English teacher telling my class partner - agree to be interviewed for our third form project if we knocked on every door in Dahlia Street until a mad redhead answered.
 We decided to do Katherine Mansfield instead and I have regretted nothing so keenly, after I read a newspaper piece lately about another Palmerston girl who, age eight and intent on being a writer, put a note in Frame's mailbox asking for advice. Days later, she appeared at the door with a blank diary, and a note inside that said, "To Vanessa. If you want to be a writer, you must write and see what happens."
 Frame wasn't mad of course, and not a recluse; she used to go into Bennett's Bookshop on the Square, agreeing to sign books as long as she was allowed to do it out the back, I learned from the same piece. I used to go into Bennett's to buy scratch n' sniff stickers and wonder, now, if I ever did so on the same day; if I saw Frame but didn't know who I was looking at.
 Before Palmerston, Frame lived in Levin, moving there in 1983. My nana lived there then and I used to go and stay with her for weekends; I Google-mapsed it and if Frame's house was on Rugby Street, I passed it on my way to the dairy, where I got sent by myself, age five, to buy Sunday Special (Sunday Special!)
 I was a slow walker, and used to sing all the way and pick flowers out of people's gardens - you were allowed any that overhung the fence - and wonder as well if I helped myself to any of her freesias, or if my meandering made-up songs carried in through her windows, distracting a writer so averse to noise that, according to Jane Campion's exquisite recollection of meeting Frame, published in The Guardian, she laid a second layer of bricks along the front her house and wore ear muffs inside.

As above. These downsizing trend is no longer environmental friendly, said Volkswagen. Just do what Mazda (SkyActiv-X) and Toyota (Dynamic Force) engine does, kept the original displacement (2000cc / 2500cc) and increase the efficiency of the engine. This will help with climate change, not by adding more turbos on a tiny little engine. Also, these 1.0L and 1.5L engines are WAYYY too stressed, and long term reliability are not guaranteed… Look at the Civic 1.5T, endless problem with engine. It is capable, of course, but in the long run, engine with 2.0L and above is more smooth, more reliable and not as rattly-sounding. For me, the great balance is a 2000 cc with single or twin turbos like in the Infiniti Q50 and Toyota Harrier. A healthy 245+ horsepower for extra oomph and a reasonable sized engine for longevity

 STOCKHOLM, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo rattled home a superb first- half free kick to become only the second male player to score 100 international goals as Portugal outclassed 10-man Sweden 2-0 in their Nations League A Group 3 game on Tuesday.
 Portugal's captain scored with a dipping set-piece effort just before halftime to join Ali Daei, who netted 109 times for Iran, on a century of goals.
 The 35-year-old was a constant threat to Sweden's back line in the early exchanges, hanging on the shoulder of the last defender before bursting forward to beat the offside trap, but Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen was equal to the task.
 That all changed when Gustav Svensson received his second yellow card and was sent packing after a reckless challenge on Joao Moutinho on the edge of his own box just before halftime.
 Ronaldo stepped up and smashed a dipping effort beyond the despairing dive of Olsen and just under the crossbar before breaking into a wide smile as he celebrated with his team mates.
 Sweden were struggling to contain the visitors and Ronaldo struck again in the 73rd minute with another curling, dipping effort, this time from open play, to leave himself just eight goals short of Daei's international scoring record. (Reporting by Philip O'Connor; Editing by Ken Ferris)

LOS ANGELES, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The body that hands out the Academy Awards on Tuesday published detailed inclusion and diversity guidelines that filmmakers will have to meet in order for their work to be eligible for a best picture Oscar, starting in 2024.
 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which has been criticized for honoring few movies and creators of color, said the standards represent a new phase of a 5-year effort to promote diversity on and off screen.
 The rules lay out percentages or numbers of actors, production staff, marketing staff and internships on a movie that must be filled by people of color, women, people with disabilities or people from the LGBTQ community.
 "We believe these inclusion standards will be a catalyst for long-lasting, essential change in our industry," Academy President David Rubin and Chief Executive Dawn Hudson said in a joint statement.
 The rules will not apply to films vying for Oscars at the next ceremony in 2021, but movies that want to be considered eligible for a best picture nomination at the 2024 Oscars will have to meet two of the four new standards, the Academy said.
 The four standards cover diversity representation among actors and subject matter; behind-the-camera staff, such as cinematographers and costume designers; paid apprenticehips and training opportunities; and marketing and publicity.
 Criticism of the film academy intensified in 2016 with the social media hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, a backlash against two consecutive years of an all- white field of acting contenders.
 Hollywood has come under further scrutiny this summer. Amid mass protests over systemic racism in the United States, streaming service HBO Max added a disclaimer and an introduction to the 1939 Oscar-winning Civil War film "Gone with the Wind."
 Since 2015, the Academy has doubled the number of women and people of color in its invitation-only ranks. The Academy's more than 8,000 members vote to choose the Oscar winners.

DANSVILLE -- The COVID-19 pandemic may have robbed the Dansville Gliders of their inaugural season, but the franchise is still looking to hit a home run this summer.
   
 Owner Steve Ackley is planning a thank you dinner for host families, staff and sponsors at the Dansville American Legion Wednesday, Sept. 16.
   
 "I wanted to do something good for the community of Dansville, especially the host families," Ackley said. "We decided on a thank you dinner. It's taken a lot of people to get to this point where we are now."
   
 The Gliders, a member of the New York Collegiate Baseball League (NYCBL), had the lineup set for their first summer in Dansville this year until COVID-19 canceled the season. The franchise had 28 of the 32 beds needed for players and coaches all lined up as early as the March 22 team meeting.
   
 The coronavirus shut down the season a short time later, but Ackley wanted to put together an event this summer to thank the Dansville community for welcoming the franchise with open arms. Ackley previously operated the team as the Wellsville Nitros in Allegany County. Ackley kicked off each Nitros season with a welcome dinner and decided to thank the Gliders supporters this summer even though the team has yet to play a game.
   
 "The biggest thing I can say about Dansville is it's a tight-knit community, not only of people but of organizations," Ackley said. "Everybody works together and supports each other."
   
 Attendance at the dinner will be limited to 50 given COVID-19 restrictions. Although the franchise's first pitch in Dansville was delayed, the Gliders have spent the summer getting better -- specifically, making improvements to their home field at Babcock Park. Investment by the Village of Dansville and a few private donations have helped turn the diamond and park infrastructure into an NYCBL-level complex.
   
 "Because we couldn't play, work began on the field," Ackley said. "Rotary Park has never had a whole lot more done to go above and beyond what the high school needs. Now, we've built some changing sheds to tie right into the end of the dugout that are 16 feet long, one at each end of the dugout. The players can go in there and change their clothes, all their bags will be left in there so they're not out behind the dugouts. That takes care of a lot of issues. The buildings are built. The village has poured pads on the end of those dugouts where these buildings are going to sit. We've added water at the end of the dugouts on the home base side."
   
 The improvements don't stop there.
   
 "We've upgraded the bullpen in left field and added a new one in right field. We've also added 16 foot of covered seating for the bullpen benches," Ackley added. "The backstop was 40some years old. The fence is coming down. The pipes are going to be recoated. New black rubber coated chain link fence is going back up. Netting will be extended out from the backstop over the buildings.
   
 "The biggest thing, over off right field where the fireman's pavilion is, the fence has been taken down, new parking has been put in place along the road, and the whole thing will be retooled and more parking has been built behind the fireman's pavilion. A new parking spot has been built when you pull into Rotary Park off Morey. All this was done contingent on the Gliders coming."
   
 The Gliders will have 20 home games (a few were scheduled at Wayland-Cohocton in 2020, with the remainder at Babcock Park). Ackley said his past estimates indicate the franchise generates $700,000 in a year, with food and dining out for players, dining and local lodging stays for families of the players, and associated team expenses.
   
 The NYCBL is a wood bat league that draws in collegiate players from around the country joining NYCBL rosters for the summer to improve their skills. Many have big league dreams, and some make it to the pros.
   
 Some past big leaguers with NYCBL ties include Tim Hudson, Dallas Braden and Rajai Davis, who all played for the nearby Hornell Dodgers, and Rob Scahill, who played for the Nitros.
   
 The Gliders have been meeting once a month, while the next NYCBL league meeting is set for Sept. 12.
   
 "The league is moving forward with the 2021 season. At this time it looks like all 12 teams will be back," Ackley said. "The league will come back stronger. Everybody has been off a year and wants to come back better."
   
 Randy Mutt, the pitching coach at Genesee Community College, will guide the Gliders in 2021.
   
 "He's already in the process of recruiting. We're going to put a full team together," Ackley said. "We'll address the COVID situation when it comes time, probably in February. We're hoping a vaccine will be in place by then. Colleges have got to start first. Everything is hinging on that. We're moving forward business as usual. We are looking forward to 2021."

 The African wild dog distinguishes itself from rival predators like lions and hyenas by using the unique hunting style of chasing prey over long distances until the target collapses from exhaustion, instead of relying upon speed, strength or stealth. A comprehensive new anatomical study of this endangered species, also known as the African painted dog or Cape hunting dog, has identified crucial evolutionary adaptations for endurance running in the animal's forelimb bones, muscles and ligaments that help sustain its life on the run.
