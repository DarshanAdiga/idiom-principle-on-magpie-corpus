Perry wrote “we must never give up” in a heartfelt first-person essay in People magazine detailing his thoughts on racial injustice and police brutality against unarmed black people in America. Perry said he almost passed on publishing his essay in the upcoming issue, which will be released Friday, but the filmmaker felt compelled to follow through because he’s “exhausted” from what he's recently seen across the country.

Lawrence "Larry" James Crosman, 91, passed away surrounded by his family on June 15, 2020.   He was the beloved husband of the late Lillian Silliker Crosman to whom he was married for   63 years.      Born on June 16, 1928 in Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada, he was the son of the late George and Georgie Crosman. He grew up in Brighton, MA, and graduated from Cheshire Academy in CT. Lawrence commenced study at Boston University and there was inspired to enlist in the Army.      Lawrence was stationed in Japan at the end of World War II. Working as a Public Relations Officer for Stars and Stripes, he reported on occupation activities of allied troops, including the Far East Military Tribunal.      After completing his military service, Lawrence returned to Boston University becoming a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity. He graduated from Boston University with a B.S. degree in Business Administration. He was an active member of the Boston Jaycees. Lawrence and Lillian moved to New Jersey, where he completed his Master's degree in business at NYU. They returned to Boston where Lawrence began his 30-year career at John Hancock, advancing to Senior Vice President of Data Processing. Lawrence attended the 65th Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.      Lil and Larry resided in Sharon MA, for 44 years. While a resident of Sharon, Larry helped establish Pop Warner football and coached baseball. He was a member of the Rotary Club and the First Congregational Church of Sharon. They moved to North Attleboro in 2001.      Lawrence will be remembered as an exceptional Dad. He was a voracious reader, whose mind never rested. His advice and counsel was solicited and appreciated by all. Larry was a collector.   He was a master model ship builder, puzzler, traveler and stamp collector.      He leaves his children: Lin Chabra and her husband Mark of Reading, MA; Laurel Peter of North Attleboro; Lloyd Crosman and his wife Kelly of Babylon, NY; and Lawrence Crosman and his wife Kristine of North Attleboro.

He was the proud grandfather of Amy Ferranti, who lovingly cared for him, Jackie, Casey, Michael, Dan, Kevin, Zachary, Lily, Christopher, Carley, Kelsey, Connor, Erin, Cameron, Kailyn (deceased), Lydia and Joshua. He was the great-grandfather of Daniel, Collin, Milo, Liam, Lucy and MacKenzie.      He was the dear brother-in-law of Jane Brietzke of Harwich, MA and the late Virginia Gettings.   He leaves many nieces and nephews.      His family will hold a private celebration of his life. Interment will be at a later date at the Massachusetts National Cemetery in Bourne.

Among these services' older slabs, for instance, are the PCGS "Old Green Holders," known by their initials -- "OGH"; and older NGC holders known by what they resemble, such as a "Soap Dish."
 Those slabs -- especially early "Rattler" PCGS ones -- are poor examples of graphic design. Labels on "Rattlers" are in typewriter font, and the coins inside often jostle to become upside down. (As for NGC's Soap Dish, slabs should not look like bathroom accessories.)
 Current PCGS and NGC holders are modern looking and attractive. I have a few quibbles, however.
 Because PCGS lists two sets of numbers on its label -- one for the coin, one for certification -- there is less room for the various forms of First Strike, VAM Hot List and coin nickname nomenclatures.
 The label information is also easily obscured by a Certified Acceptance Corp. sticker. Type the terms "PCGS, VAM, CAC" into an online search engine and see the images for examples of the problem. These considerations play a role in where I send coins for slabbing.
 I also try to match the coin's type, metal, luster and patina with the graphic design of the holder.
 PCGS's current light-blue-labeled holder is ideal for deep-mirror, prooflike coins, accentuating the reflection like a silver moon on water -- simply breathtaking!
 The PCGS label also highlights the beauty of gold, light gray or Mint State and Proof silver coins as well as most copper-nickel, copper-nickel clad and red copper coins.
 In particular, the blue label spectacularly showcases pastel patina on American Eagle silver dollars and Morgan dollars, but may be too dark for some brown copper coins, circulated silver coins and coins with dark red, blue and purple patina.
 Coins with rainbow patina look lovely in NGC holders because the white background highlights the colors. NGC's holders also complement the metallic beauty of gold and most copper-nickel, copper-nickel clad, circulated silver and all copper coins. However, bright white silver coins may wash out against white labels.

Frisby said that the most significant part of the acronym was to include indigenous people, who are also asking for policing to change, in discussions where race is mentioned.
 “What we know is, more often than not, they have been pretty much nonexistent in any discussion about race or any discussion or any kinds of things,” she said. “We don’t see any narratives that include them. What we do see when indigenous people are included are sports. We have images and mascot controversy, and then you have products that rely on indigenous people like Land O’ Lakes margarine and butter.”
 Many black people are open to giving space to the plight of Native Americans, but there is a frustration when it comes to the BIPOC term.
 “It is lazy to lump us all together as if we all face the same problems,” said Sylvia Obell, a host of the Netflix podcast “Okay, Now Listen.” “When you blend us all together like this, it’s erasure. It allows people to get away with not knowing people of color and our separate set of issues that we all face. It allows people to play it safe and not leave anyone out, and it also allows you to not have to do the work.”
 In a moment when black Americans are asking that the names of those killed at the hands of the police be said aloud, and when black people are asking for equal treatment on a global scale, trying to fit all people of color and Native Americans in one term can seem tone deaf.

And yet, in so far as what was known at the time, he wasn’t wrong. From a certain perspective, scientists arguing that the earth had to be hundreds of millions of years old had no better explanation for the sun than Thomson had for people who furnished arguments in favor of the age of the earth. The disciplines of geology and biology were at loggerheads with physics. In this day and age, it’s easy to point fingers at Thomson and insist that he should have had the sense to yield, but in that time period, he was working with well-established theories of gravitation and heat energy that had held up to scrutiny and which were in use in many different disciplines. Geologists and biologists, on the other hand, were basing their arguments on speculative dating methods that could not, at that time, be verified experimentally.

It later was included in the collections of Philadelphia coin dealer Harlan P. Smith, and later Chicago brewer Virgil Brand. “When Brand’s estate was parceled out before World War II, it passed through the hands of two coin dealers before being sold to New York City numismatist Oscar J. Pearl, whose collection of 1793 large cents was called ‘undoubtedly one of the finest in existence.’ T. James Clarke purchased this coin from the fixed price list of Pearl’s collection in 1944 for $850 and owned it for a decade before selling it to R.E. ‘Ted’ Naftzger, the most famous large cent collector of all time. Naftzger held this coin for nearly 40 years, until he sold his collection in 1992 and this coin sold to the present owner and has remained off the market ever since.”

 This astounding breakthrough is testament to the incredible work being done by our scientists behind the scenes, he said.
 The drug has also been added to the UK government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country.
 This will protect supply for UK patients by enforcing regulatory action on those who flout the restrictions, the Department of Health said.
 The trial formed part of the 2.1-million pounds Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY (RECOVERY) trial, backed by the UK government to explore innovative medicines in the fight against the novel coronavirus.

Interest payments on deposits and loans are the basic principles on which the banking system operates. Banks pay interest to depositors against the money parked with them in savings or fixed deposits (FDs) and charge interest from borrowers. In other words, banks use the interest earned on loans to pay the depositors. If banks are asked to stop taking interest on the money they lend, it will disturb this balance. If the apex court insists that banks cannot charge interest on loans, it will impact the ability of the lenders to pay interest to the depositors as well.
