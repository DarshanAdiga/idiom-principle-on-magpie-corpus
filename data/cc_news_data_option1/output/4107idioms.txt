“Our organization wants their respect. Laker Nation wants their respect,” James said. “And I want my damn respect, too.”
 Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who dealt with the enormous anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.
 It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.
 “We have a Ph.D in adversity, I’ll tell you that much,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “We’ve been through a lot.”
 They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise — and against the Heat franchise that showed him to to become a champion.
 Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler — the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention. Rajon Rondo scored 19 points for the Lakers, who put together the elite talents of James and Davis with this moment in mind.
 And Davis, as white and gold confetti coated the floor around him, spent his first moments as an NBA champion thinking of Bryant.
 “All we wanted to do was do it for him,” Davis said. “And we didn’t let him down. ... I know he’s looking down on us, proud of us.”
 With that, the league’s bubble chapter, put together after a 4 1/2-month suspension of play that started March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic and came with a promise that it would raise awareness to the problems of racial injustice and police brutality, is over. So, too, is a season that saw the league and China get into political sparring, the death on Jan. 1 of commissioner emeritus David Stern — the man who did so much to make the league what it is — and then the shock on Jan. 26 that came with the news that Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other died in a helicopter crash.

Candidates for the 24th Congressional District will field questions from a panel of Central Coast reporters during a virtual forum Saturday sponsored by KEYT-TV in Santa Barbara and broadcast live via the NOW Channel and online.
 Incumbent Democrat Salud Carbajal, of Santa Barbara, is being challenged for his seat in the House of Representatives by Republican Andy Caldwell, of Santa Maria, in the Nov. 3 general election.
 The two were scheduled to meet face to face, albeit socially distanced, in the forum at KEYT’s studio until Carbajal announced last week he had been exposed to and then tested positive for COVID-19.
 That’s when organizers decided, for everyone’s health and safety, to take the program virtual so everyone could participate without traveling to the station, said Jim Lemon, news director for NPG of California.

Though disappointed that his labour of love is being unfairly targeted, the actor asserts his freedom of speech can't be curbed. "I feel bad when people talk about boycotting the show because so many people are involved in making it. Sometimes, I have to weigh my options and take a step back for the larger good of others; I don't want them to bear the brunt of my actions. That said, I will not stop raising my voice. I am an artiste in a free world, I am supposed to raise questions. The environment of hate needs to be tackled with peace. We are the country that won its freedom through peace, after all."

One of the documents even alluded to the possibility that the May 22, 1949 death of James Forrestal – the first U.S. Secretary of Defense – was not the suicide that many assumed it was. Rather, the Cooper papers suggest, Forrestal had to be taken out of circulation to ensure that he didn’t go public on what he knew about flying saucers. What really set the Cooper-era Majestic 12 documentation apart from that which caught the attention of the Moore- Shandera-Friedman team in the 1980s, however, were the references to deadly viruses. Indeed, in several of the papers provided to Cooper there were references to plans to try and back-engineer an alien virus. This was way more controversial than the original Majestic 12 documents that reached Jaime Shandera and Bill Moore. Tim Cooper quit the UFO scene more than a few years ago. He has not returned. And no more leaked documents have surfaced. Who, precisely, Cantwheel and Salina were - and what their true agenda was in the matter of aliens (dead or alive) - remains a mystery. As does just about everything - from the 1970s to the 1990s - that relates to the matter of alleged leaked documents of a UFO-themed nature.

The veteran caught all four of his targets in Week 5, posting 90 yards along the way -- or 18 more than his counterpart, Tyler Higbee, has mustered in his past three games combined. In Week 6, gamers should watch how this dynamic plays out once more before investing much into Everett. He could be worth a speculative buck or first-come, first-served addition in deeper setups. Higbee, aside from a three-TD outburst vs. Philly, has been unplayable after his monster run to close out the 2019 season. Higbee ran only 16 percent of the routes in Week 5, and the matchup couldn't have been much more favorable for his position, so keep tabs on how this works out vs. the New York Giants next Sunday. New York has been strong at limiting receivers, which means the target distribution is more important than the actual results.

_SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) Illinois voters are being asked whether they want to change the state 's income-tax structure from a flat-rate system to one that reportedly takes more from wealthier residents. Gov. J.B. Pritzker is backing what he calls the “fair tax,” and promising that no one making less than $250,000 would pay more. That's 97% of taxpayers. But wealthier taxpayers would pay up to a top rate of 7.99%. In theory, it would generate $3.4 billion more a year in revenue. Opponents claim it will give lawmakers a “blank check” to increase spending without paying the state's massive pile of debt, and would also tax retirement income, and raise taxes on small businesses at a time, when many are failing due to heavy state ordered Coronavirus restrictions._

 The Golden Tornadoes are in a rebuilding phase, having been outscored 41-0 in its four matches this fall.
