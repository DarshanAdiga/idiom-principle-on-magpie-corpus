"We've got to go through a period of no new cases like we have, but it will take tenacity - no saying 'we're doing all right now' and reopening a few pubs and setting us back three weeks."

Sunderland must recruit well if they are to steer clear of yet another Premier League relegation scrap next season, says Dick Advocaat.
 The Dutchman replaced Gus Poyet in March and guided Sunderland to safety with a return of 12 points from nine matches, which saw them finish 16th.
 An offer is on the table to extend Advocaat's stay and, although he refused to be drawn on his own future, he outlined what needs to be done on the playing side.
 "Wait and see [about my future]," the 67-year-old said after Sunday's 3-1 defeat to champions Chelsea. "They offered me two or three years, but I have to be honest with myself and everybody else about what I will do.
 "I need to do it as quick as possible so the club can go on as well.
 "We need a better balance. We definitely need three, four or five players in to get better competition in the squad."
 Advocaat was able to find some positives in their final loss of the campaign, but admitted the gap in quality was evident as Chelsea came from behind to take all three points.
 He added: "We lost 3-1, but there was no need to lose 3-1 because we had opportunities to score.
 "In the end Chelsea has the better players and the better skills to make the opportunities more than we do.
 "But for me it was imp to see a team free of relegation and not scared to do something.
 "I have been in several leagues [during my career] but this was a great two and a half months.
 "It was difficult, but the players adapted really quickly. Their commitment to the club was great, they did it and I'm really proud of them."

Knafeh Café, a bakery that specializes in the namesake pastry, is feeling the pandemic pinch in another way. Ramadan is a big season for the cheesy, shredded-dough dessert but owner Asem Abusir has seen catering, across the board, take a steep hit.
 “Everyone canceled all the reservations that we had,” he says. “We lost all of that. Catering has been the biggest impact on Knafeh Café.”
 To compensate for the loss of walk-in customers and event catering, Knafeh Café is now offering free shipping nationwide. Abusir also is selling a personal-sized tray more suited to a stay-at-home family than a big get- together. “We’re trying to be creative,” he says.
 And that sense of innovation will be needed to keep Little Arabia going against the odds. It doesn’t hurt to have a little hope too.

RALEIGH — North Carolina will need more widespread COVID-19 testing, extensive efforts to track down people in contact with the sick and slowed case and hospital rates before movement and commerce restrictions can ease, Gov. Roy Cooper said on Wednesday.
 Cooper, who must decide soon what to do with a stay-at-home order that expires April 29, also warned that any improvements for businesses and the public will be incremental, and could be turned on and off like a dimmer switch, depending on the data.
 “I know the changes that we’ve all made in our lives seem to have happened very quickly,” Cooper said at a media briefing, but “undoing those changes won’t happen as fast. To protect our health and long-term economic prosperity, we have to act with care, rather than haste.”
 The governor said any “new normal” could include partially-full restaurants and concerts and sporting events without audiences in the name of social distancing and safety. And residents most vulnerable to the new coronavirus still must be protected until a vaccine or effective treatment is available.
 Cooper and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen didn't give many specifics on what would equate to meeting testing, tracing and statistical goals. But Cohen said there were good developments on testing access, and the case count shows the stay-at-home order is working.
 State DHHS data shows there were over 5,100 positive COVID-19 cases as of Wednesday morning, which was only a 1 percent increase compared to Tuesday. The number of COVID-19-related deaths grew by nine to 117, while current hospitalizations increased slightly to about 430.
 Cohen said efforts were underway to expand the workforce to join local health workers who already track down people in contact with those testing positive in order to control the virus' spread. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, and the vast majority survive. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause pneumonia or death.
 Cooper released his parameters on reopening the day after dozens of protesters unhappy with the stay-at-home order stood together near their cars in a parking lot within sight of the Executive Mansion. One person was arrested who refused to leave after Raleigh police told the crowd repeatedly that they were violating Cooper’s executive order requiring social distancing.
 The order and an earlier ban on dine-in service at restaurants and bars, like those in other states, have contributed to a massive economic setback. Nearly 600,000 initial unemployment benefit claims have been filed with the state in the last four weeks.
 Several Republican lawmakers, in particular Senate leader Phil Berger, have urged more widespread testing to better determine the extent of the virus within the population.
 The General Assembly’s decision to spend $100,000 to help jump-start an effort by Wake Forest University to collect data on people who have developed immunity to the virus is part of that effort. The money will be used to purchase and send 1,000 at-home antibody kits to a sample of state residents.
 “Without hard data to back up the opinions that are being expressed, people are increasingly going to be reluctant to comply with government-mandated shutdowns,” Berger told reporters on Wednesday. The data also may show that the spread of COVID-19 is not as great as leaders have feared, he said.
 Cohen said she wasn't aware of the Wake Forest activity until it was announced earlier this week. She emphasized collaboration with the state and researchers to share data on various components of the virus for maximum benefit to the public.
 Deaths continue to accumulate in North Carolina nursing homes. Franklin County health officials said Wednesday that three more residents at the Louisburg Nursing Center have died, bringing the total of resident deaths to five. Six residents at the Springbrook Rehabilitation & Nursing Center in Johnston County have also died, officials said.
 Four prisoners who tested positive for COVID-19 at the medium-security federal correctional institution in Butner have died, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said. Forty-six inmates and 27 staff members there have tested positive there so far.

When trying to decide who the best center fielder in the history of the Texas Rangers organization is, a few different names popped into my head, but in my opinion, none of them truly belong in the discussion with Josh Hamilton.
 I’ll never forget watching the 2008 Home Run Derby where Hamilton jacked one home run after another, finishing with 28 in the first round.
 I remember being at the ballpark and pulling out my phone to film a grand slam by Hamilton. I wish I still had that video.
 I will never forget watching him hit four home runs against Baltimore.
 I have several fond memories of watching Hamilton swing a bat and run into walls to make great catches, which was the source of several of his injuries.
 Hamilton first came to Texas in 2008 where he spent the next five years. His time with the club came to an ugly ending when he signed with the Angels and put a bad taste in the mouths of Rangers fans by calling Arlington a “football town.”
 His time with the Angels didn’t go as he or the club had hoped for and Hamilton burned bridges with that franchise as well.
 He landed back in Texas, but was never the same.
 Throughout his career, Hamilton battled his demons. He has a past full of drugs and alcohol that he couldn’t seem to shake, and even recently he has been indicted on a felony charge of injury to a minor, his daughter.
 While with the team, he wrote a book called, “Beyond Belief: Finding the Strength to Come Back.”
 The story was a great one, but it’s not his whole story. Unfortunately, Hamilton’s story doesn’t seem to have such a happy ending.
 With that being said though, what he did on the field tells a different story – a story that in my mind, makes him the best to ever place center field for the Rangers.
 As a Ranger, Hamilton had a batting average of .302 with 814 hits, 150 home runs, 531 RBIs and 441 runs.
 When his MLB career was all said and done, he had a batting average of .290, 1,134 hits, 200 home runs, 701 RBIs and 609 runs scored.
 He was an All-Star in all five years of his first stint with the Rangers. He was the 2010 American League MVP before being name the ALCS MVP.
 That year, he was also the AL batting champion.
 Hamilton won three Silver Slugger Awards and was the American League’s RBI leader in 2008.
 This past August, I was at Globe Life Park when Hamilton was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame.
 Sure, Hamilton had his flaws, but who doesn’t? Those flaws don’t take away what he accomplished on the field, and in my book, the Rangers have never had a better center fielder.

John Terry believes Chelsea's current squad has the potential to exceed the achievements made by the club during Jose Mourinho's first spell in charge.
 The former England international lifted the Premier League trophy for the fourth time on Sunday after Chelsea's 3-1 win over Sunderland, the third title the club have won under Mourinho.
 Terry is one of a few members in the current side who played when Chelsea last dominated the division under the head coach, and he believes they could have more success given their strength in depth.
 "I think you look back at our squad in 2004-05 and 2005-06, we were at the peak at the time," he told Talksport. "You look back at some of the players for that era. We set some great targets for this generation to achieve and this team is doing that now.
 "Looking at this squad now, I think this squad has the potential to do a lot more than we did in the past, well beyond my playing days.
 "It is not just the players that have done so well for us this season. There are so many young lads who could make the breakthrough to the team, too many to mention.
 "It is harder than ever for them to breakthrough as you don't get five games to find your feet any more, but the rewards are greater than ever as well."
 Terry has played every minute in their league success this season, and the 34-year-old has no intention of calling time on his career just yet.
 He added: "I would love to finish my career at Chelsea and maybe there is a time when I look to go to play in America or whatever might be best for my family at the time.
 "Hopefully I have a couple of years left at least. I always thought I could get to age of 35 and still [be] playing and I am getting close to that now."

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Plans by New Mexico's largest electric provider to replace the capacity that will be lost when it shutters a major coal-fired power plant in 2022 are being scrutinized by state regulators, including one who suggested Wednesday that the utility might need to seek new bids. The plans call for a mix of new natural gas plants, solar arrays and battery storage to replace the San Juan Generating Station near Farmington. The state's new energy transition law calls for siting of the new projects to be among the considerations as lawmakers wanted to help offset job losses and reductions in tax revenues that are expected for the community. Public Regulation Commissioner Stephen Fischmann said during a meeting that when seeking bids, Public Service Co. of New Mexico did not clearly specify the preference for locating the new projects in the same area as the existing plant. Fischmann said the only way to be fair to the people who live in the area is to ask the utility to conduct another round of bidding that provides more economic data and includes the location preference. “If we don’t ask them to do that, there’s no one else out there to do it,” he said, urging his fellow commissioners to “give that careful thought” before making a decision in the coming weeks. It will be up to the commission whether to sign off on PNM's plan to purchase power and sign energy storage agreements with the developers of two solar and battery storage facilities. The other elements of the replacement plan will be reviewed and decided upon later this year. The parties in the case agree that the hybrid solar-battery installations would be cost-effective and beneficial for PNM customers in the long run. One would be built on Jicarilla Apache tribal land and the...

Husband and wife veteran CRNAs on our COVID 19 airway team!Posted by Nicole DeLoach Hubbard on&nbsp;Tuesday, March 31, 2020“Everybody’s talking about the photo,” says Cayer, 46. It strikes a chord “because we’re all going through the same thing right now and it’s a symbol of hope and love.”Brock, 38, adds: “What’s important is that we stick together, we work together, and we always support each other. And not just Ben and I, but the human race right now.”The Florida pair share a home, a profession and, now, a mission — shouldering the high-risk duty of placing breathing tubes in surgery patients, any of whom may have COVID-19.They didn’t think twice about volunteering for Tampa General Hospital’s new “airway team,” Cayer says.Placing a tube into a patient’s mouth and down into their airway requires close contact — and because the virus spreads in droplets, the highest level of protective gear. To conserve gear and expose fewer health care workers, the hospital pared down staff to a minimum for intubations before surgery.Their patients have been in car crashes, or needed brain surgery because of a ruptured blood vessel. As is the case at many U.S. hospitals, only emergency surgeries continue at the Tampa hospital, to make room as the pandemic continues to crest.They met in nurse anesthesia school in 2007. In classes, they sat in alphabetical order. Brock next to Cayer, she says, “and it just took off from there.”They married five years ago and now work for TeamHealth, a medical staffing firm. But on the morning of the photo, they bickered during the drive to work. They disagreed about what to play on the car radio, and who was doing the dishes at home.The new COVID-19 procedures — it was Brock’s first day on the new team — were making them both tense.“We were arguing,” she says. Later, they found each other between surgeries. The tension melted. “All those trivial things that we were arguing about that morning, in the grand scheme of things, aren’t that important.” The photo captures that moment.He says they don’t worry much about getting sick, although the virus has come close. Brock’s mother has recovered from it. Co-workers fear catching it. Patients feel alone because visitors have been strictly limited.“We have grown men bawling because none of their family can be there with them,” Brock says.It helps to be married to another nurse, because “unless you’re here doing this, there’s no way to describe it,” she says. “He gets it.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

VERNON -- Mayor Howard Burrell is vowing to crack down on anyone violating a township-wide ban on seasonal, vacation and short-term housing rentals that went into effect earlier this week, but said he plans to keep Maple Grange Park open.
   
 The latest development, coming as Gov. Phil Murphy ordered the closure of all state parks, forests and trails Wednesday to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus from person-to-person contact, follows an administrative order issued Sunday by New Jersey State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan, the state's emergency management director, with the governor's blessing that gave local and county governments new powers to restrict short-term rentals.
   
 The governor had previously issued an order allowing municipalities to restrict online marketplaces such as Airbnb from offering short-term rental lodging in those communities, but a number of mayors including Burrell felt it didn't go far enough since many rentals, particularly in Vernon's lake communities, are done through word of mouth or other means and also because the internet is difficult for municipalities to police.
   
 "We've been asking for this (the enhanced powers delegated to municipalities) because not only did we want to regulate online short-term rentals, but we wanted to regulate them all," Burrell said.
   
 The order issued by Burrell prohibits any "hotel, motel, guest house or private residence, or parts thereof" in Vernon from accepting transient guests or seasonal tenants until further notice.
   
 The governor, in granting municipalities the expanded authority, said he did so because of reports of large numbers of people relocating temporarily to shore communities in hopes of riding out the coronavirus emergency there rather than at home. Public health officials had worried that those communities lacked the health care infrastructure that a surge in patients would require.
   
 Vernon, which itself boasts numerous natural attractions including a state park, lakes and trails, had also been the subject of complaints about large numbers of out-of-towners taking up temporary residence in the township. Burrell, in a phone conversation, said he wasn't sure what impact the closure of state parks and trails -- including the Appalachian Trail boardwalk and "Stairway to Heaven," both of which traverse state property -- would have on the number of out-of-towners coming to Vernon.
   
 The order, as written, does not prevent those who own second homes in Vernon from relocating to those homes during the emergency. It also does not apply to those who are in temporary housing as part of an emergency or housing assistance program, or to health care workers staying on a temporary basis.
   
 "There are lots of people now who are home who were not at home before," Burrell said. "Many people who live in a place like Vernon simply sleep here and then commute to work everyday, and now all those people are around, so people are seeing people they haven't seen before and might just assume they're out-of-towners."
   
 Still, he said, "I issued this order because of the concerns about an influx of new visitors to our town during the current public health emergency. Although Vernon Township ordinarily welcomes all visitors, at this time we must take all available steps to enforce social distancing recommendations and limit nonessential travel to our town."
   
 As for the township's own parks, Maple Grange Park is still open for running, walking and passive recreation. The Vernon Dog Park also remains open.
   
 However, to ensure social distancing, the playgrounds, basketball courts and athletic fields at Maple Grange Park have been closed, and no competitive sports are being allowed. Veterans Memorial Park, which consists exclusively of athletic fields, has been closed since the township-wide state of emergency that went into effect March 16.
   
 Burrell said he continues to visit Maple Grange Park up to three times per day and that, based on his own observations and those of others who have spoken with him, most if not all people appear to be heeding social distancing guidelines -- a contrast, he said, to reports cited by the governor of people in state parks ignoring verbal warnings to disperse from large gatherings.
   
 "I am pleased and proud to say that the kind of arrogant, disrespectful, and uncaring behavior and disregard for the rule of law that the governor has described is not at all what we have observed or experienced on the part of those Vernon Township residents who have used Maple Grange Park," Burrell said.
   
 "Since we are not able to monitor Maple Grange Park on a 24/7 basis, I can't say that there are no social distance violations, but what I can say is that I and others who have focused on monitoring this park have concluded that users are following the social distancing guidelines. When users have been observed interacting in a group, inquiries have found that they have been primarily family members using the park as a way of getting out of the house for some mental or emotional relief."
   
 Burrell said he would like Maple Grange Park to remain open for those who use its walking and jogging paths responsibly while practicing social distancing so that residents can continue to obtain mental, emotional and physical relief at a time when the virus otherwise has them hunkered down indoors.
   
 But, he said, "If, for one minute, I receive evidence or otherwise come to believe that my actions of keeping that park open are contrary to our efforts to flatten the curve on this virus, I will not hesitate to close it."

“Our homes are set up to relax and unwind at the end of the day, where we get ready to head out in the morning, staging areas for weekend activities,” Saxbe said, “but for many people you are not used to spending all day every day inside a home space. Like any place that you’re occupying without a break or interruption, it can become tedious or confining.”
 And spending that much time together in the same space might be magnifying existing inequalities that were easier to ignore when most of your waking hours were spent elsewhere. In many households, the division of labor is uneven, and women tend to do the bulk of the housework and child-rearing in heterosexual couples. Prior to coronavirus, some of that labor could be outsourced: daycare, babysitters, house cleaners, going out to eat instead of creating another round of dishes at home. But now, all of the responsibilities fall squarely on the adults in the house. The more glaring the inequality in the division of chores, the more the person taking on the bulk of them may start to chafe.
 “If one person was really taking care of more of the chores, that’s becoming very clear,” said Jennifer Peepas, who writes _the advice blog Captain Awkward_. “The things that were not being said and not being handled are going to come to light.”

If the reason is simply because it is a religious gathering or because it is a specific church or belief system, then not only should believers rise up against it but they have a moral duty to do so. However, if it is a legitimate reason, such as the health and safety of the public, and the state is not specifically targeting religion, then religious leaders should use the common sense God gave them and support the effort.

That would be both portfolios. We've helped a number of customers. What I would say is, those are programs or modifications that we've drawn kind of in the past on a forward-looking view. On the consumer portfolio over the last few weeks, we have granted programs and extensions of about 181,000 customers, which is about 4.9% of on and off-balance sheet exposure. In addition, we've helped 3,400 business customers or about $2 billion of total of exposure as well. So, those would not be included in those restructured numbers that you're looking at.

 TAUNTON - The number of Taunton residents testing positive for COVID-19 has risen by four during the last 24 hours, according to the office of Mayor Shaunna O'Connell.
 A total of 218 people in the city, as compared to 214 on Monday, have contracted the deadly respiratory disease, which so far has claimed 957 lives across the state, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
 The mayor's office each day gets local COVID-19 statistics from the city's Board of Health, which gets its numbers from the state's Department of Public Health.
 All 218 in Taunton who have tested positive for the deadly pandemic are on the \"active\" list of people who have not yet recovered, according to Radka Barter, the mayor's deputy chief of staff.
 The DPH on Tuesday reported 113 new coronavirus-related deaths from the previous day bringing the number of deaths throughout the state up to 957.
 DPH also reported that seven Bristol County residents have died from March 31 to April 13.
 The number of people statewide testing positive for COVID-19 from Monday through Tuesday increased by 1,296 to a total of 28,163.
 Raynham reports two new cases of residents testing positive for the disease. The town says 84 residents have been infected as compared to 82 on Monday.
 Berkely and Dighton have not updated their numbers for public view this week.
 Dighton most recently has said that 10 of its citizens have contracted the coronavirus.
 Berkley last Thursday said 17 residents had tested positive but that seven were no longer infected.

It’s true, for 50 years, we have asked our paid staff to subscribe to a Statement of Faith—but we have never asked any of the millions of people we have served to subscribe to anything. In other words, as a religious charity, while we lawfully hire staff who share our Christian beliefs, we do not discriminate in who we serve. We have provided billions of dollars of medical care and supplies, food and water, and emergency shelter without any conditions whatsoever. Our Christian faith compels us—like the biblical Good Samaritan—to love and serve everyone in need, regardless of their faith or background.
