Yes. So from a priority standpoint as you mentioned, organic generally generates best return at the lowest risk. And so, we continue to organically invest in business. That being said, it's relatively capital light and doesn't demand a lot from our free cash -- of our cash flow from operations which are quite strong. And so, we are committed dividend payer as you know and dividend increaser. We would like to do share buybacks to offset dilution, but beyond that we are really focused on the acquisition side. And, it's been a challenging 2020 and the M&A market. That being said, quite pleased that we are able to make progress with the Fluortek, with vivaMOS and then the announced divesture as well. I will tell you that we are no different than the factories who are learning how to operate and produce products safely in this environment. The M&A community is also figuring out how to do deals in this environment. And so, the market for M&A I would tell you is improving. And so, we do remain active. We are very strategically focused based on the NBS Next framework that Naga has reviewed with you and where our growth opportunities are. So, we are actively I would say -- Mike, actively working to deploy capital through the acquisitions. And the pipeline is growing as I would characterize it.

"A lot has changed for Miami since Week 1, they've really righted the ship and I give a lot of credit to Brian Flores. To me, he's the Coach of the Year in the NFL. He's done a tremendous job getting this team from where they were when he took over to where they are now which is with a chance to get in the playoffs," said Catalon. "Different quarterback than Week 1, the defense has really come together. The way that they get takeaways and put pressure on the quarterback is much different than it was when they met back in Week 1. I think this Miami team knows what's in front of them.

Sadly, their blissful happiness was overshadowed when Laura discovered she was pregnant in 2018 but suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage.
 Bravely sharing her experience in a powerful essay for Hot Press, she recalled how they received the devastating news at a 12 week scan.
 "In the room I could see the outline of what looked like a jelly baby – just like in the movies. Then silence," she wrote.
 “'I’m sorry there’s no heart-beat,'" she continued.
 "I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to react. Should I cry? Was I allowed be emotional for something unplanned?"
 Their loss made Laura realise how much she wanted to be a mum, and that Christmas she and Iain put down roots by buying their own place.
 A besotted Iain then popped the question during a holiday to South Africa after Laura stood in for Caroline Flack on Love Island at the start of the year.

Matt, what I would add to that is really that timing really depends on various different businesses, right. There are certain businesses, like our medical business, it's pretty much not a backlog kind of business; it's more a book and ship kind of business. But if you contrast that with an ICS business, that is more backlog-oriented. You get the order, then you have a large system that you have to put together. And then our aftermarket parts revenues are pretty much book and ship. And in our adhesive business is somewhere in between, it is more standard products that you're customizing or configuring to sell. So, depending on a business, depending on where it is there is a correlation of timing that we talk about.

The researchers then turn off the green laser and lattice and switch to a red tweezer laser, which requires more power but is conducive to clock behavior. The atoms held by the tweezers are excited by a pink "clock laser" applied perpendicular to the tweezer light, along with a magnetic field. The clock laser excites the atoms, which begin ticking between two internal energy levels. (See animation of how the clock works.) Finally, the green tweezers are turned back on and a camera records the atoms' state; they fluoresce only at the low energy level, so the ticking is recorded as flashing light and can be converted to a timing signal.

  He came to the United States in 2001 to visit his sister, Nurit Barnett, who teaches at a Jewish day school, and got stuck after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Through Barnett, he met and later married his wife, Abby. The couple lives in University Heights and belongs to Zichron Chaim in University Heights.


  Aloni said he can’t compete with big-box stores on price. His advantage, he said, is in service.


  During the pandemic, he has begun doing some nearby home delivery and curbside pickup.


  When sending out gift orders, he photographs the wrapped gifts and texts the photo to the buyer so they know how the gift will look.

PARIS (AP) — The fugitive widow of an Islamic State gunman and a man described as his logistician on Wednesday were convicted of terrorism charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison in the trial of 14 people linked to the January 2015 attacks in Paris against the satirical Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket.The verdict ends the three-month trial linked to the three days of killings across Paris claimed jointly by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. During the proceedings, France was struck by new attacks, a wave of coronavirus infections among the defendants, and devastating testimony bearing witness to bloodshed that continues to shake France.All three attackers died in police raids. The widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, fled to Syria and is believed to still be alive. The two men who spirited her out of France, who were also tried in absentia, are thought to be dead, although one received a sentence of life in prison just in case.Eleven others were present and all were convicted of the crime, with sentences ranging from 30 years for Ali Riza Polat, described as the lieutenant of the virulently anti-Semitic market attacker, Amédy Coulibaly, to four years with a simple criminal conviction. The Jan. 7-9, 2015 attacks in Paris left 17 dead along with the three gunmen. The 11 on trial in a specially formed terrorism court, all men, formed a loose circle of friends and criminal acquaintances who claimed any facilitating they may have done was unwitting or for more run-of- the mill crime like armed robbery. One gambled day and night during the three- day period, learning what had happened only after emerging blearily from the casino. Another was a pot-smoking ambulance driver. A third was a childhood friend of the market attacker, who got beaten to a pulp by the latter over a debt.It was the coronavirus infection of Polat, who arranged the weapons and vehicle purchases, that forced the suspension of the trial for a month. Polat’s profane outbursts and insults drew rebukes from the chief judge. A handwriting expert testified it was Polat who scrawled a price list of arms and munitions.In all, investigators sifted through 37 million bits of phone data, according to video testimony by judicial police. Among the men cuffed behind the courtroom’s enclosed stands, flanked by masked and armed officers, were several who had exchanged dozens of texts or calls with Coulibaly in the days leading up to the attack. Also testifying were the widows of Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, the brothers who stormed Charlie Hebdo’s offices on Jan. 7, 2015, decimating the newspaper’s editorial staff in what they said was an act of vengeance for its publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad years before. The offices had been firebombed before and were unmarked, and editors had round-the-clock protection. But it wasn’t enough. In all, 12 people died that day. The first was Frédéric Boisseau, who worked in maintenance. Then the Kouachis seized Corinne Rey, a cartoonist who had gone down to smoke, and forced her upstairs to punch in the door code. She watched in horror as they opened fire on the editorial meeting.“I was not killed, but what happened to me was absolutely chilling and I will live with it until my life is over,” she testified.The next day, Coulibaly shot and killed a young policewoman after failing to attack a Jewish community center in the suburb of Montrouge. By then, the Kouachis were on the run and France was paralyzed with fear. Authorities didn’t link the shooting to the massacre at Charlie Hebdo immediately. They were closing in on the fugitive brothers when the first alerts came of a gunman inside a kosher supermarket. It was a wintry Friday afternoon, and customers were rushing to finish their shopping before the Sabbath when Coulibaly entered, carrying an assault rifle, pistols and explosives. With a GoPro camera fixed to his torso, he methodically fired on an employee and a customer, then killed a second customer before ordering a cashier to close the store’s metal blinds, images shown to a hushed courtroom. The first victim, Yohan Cohen, lay dying on the ground and Coulibaly turned to some 20 hostages and asked if he should “finish him off.” Despite their pleas, Coulibaly fired a killing shot, according to testimony from cashier Zarie Sibony.“You are Jews and French, the two things I hate the most,” Coulibaly told them. Some 40 kilometers (25 miles) away, the Kouachi brothers were cornered in a printing shop with their own hostages. Ultimately, all three attackers died in near-simultaneous police raids. It was the first attack in Europe claimed by the Islamic State group, which struck Paris again later that year to even deadlier effect. Prosecutors said the Kouachis essentially self- financed their attack, while Coulibaly and his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, took out fraudulent loans. Boumeddiene, the only woman on trial, fled to Syria days before the attack and appeared in Islamic State propaganda.One witness, the French widow of an Islamic State emir, testified from prison that she’d run across Boumeddiene late last year at a camp in Syria and Boumeddiene’s foster sisters said they believed she was still alive. Testifying as a free man after a brief prison term, for reasons both defense attorneys and victims described as baffling, was the far-right sympathizer turned police informant who actually sold the weapons to Coulibaly. Three weeks into the trial, on Sept. 25, a Pakistani man steeped in radical Islam and armed with a butcher’s knife attacked two people outside the former Charlie Hebdo offices on Nicolas-Appert street long since vacated by the publication. Six weeks into the trial, on Oct. 16, a French schoolteacher who opened a debate on free speech by showing students the Muhammad caricatures was beheaded by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee.Eight weeks into the trial, on Oct. 30, a young Tunisian armed with a knife and carrying a copy of the Quran attacked worshippers in a church in the southern city of Nice, killing three. He had a photo of the Chechen on his phone and an audio message describing France as a “country of unbelievers.” Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The pandemic still prevents many musicians from playing together in person, but Endlesss (no, that's still not a typo) is about to make remote production more practical. It just released Endlesss Studio, a desktop version of its music collaboration app. The Mac software is built around cloud-linked, multi-track composition hat lets you quickly build tracks alone or with others, including in live jam sessions. You can even hand off between the iOS and Mac apps with little effort -- say, to add vocals after you've created the beat.Endlesss promises tight integration with "all" major digital audio workstation software, including Ableton Live, FL Studio and Logic Pro. You can work with AU and VST plugins as well as MIDI controllers. Studio will be available for $99 (£79) until the end of March 2021, when the price climbs to $199 (£159). A Windows version is coming in summer 2021.The software might make the most sense for electronic musicians given its emphasis on loops -- some of its earliest users have included dance legends Underworld as well as Imogen Heap. Nonetheless, it could be very useful for any group determined to create albums when they're far apart, even when it's safe to meet face to face.

The event included plenty of criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. At one point, Ransby likened the dilemma over criticizing Israel while fighting anti-Semitism to the dilemma African-American leftist activists faced over whether to criticize Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean anti-colonial activist who became a dictator.


  “My side of the debate argued that, no — that we had an obligation to speak out because we had understood the struggle that he came out of,” she said. “Obviously there are historical differences, but I think of that in terms of how we view the silencing around discussing Israel and who has a right to critique and who has an obligation to critique.”


  The panel did include acknowledgement of anti-Semitism on the left. Hill, who was unable to attend the live event because of his father’s death but shared prerecorded responses, praised Jews who had worked with him in activist movements and said people need to call out anti-Semitism in their own ideological camps.


  “I not only became aware of anti-Semitism as an idea but I began to hear it and see it in practice,” he said. “There were moments when I would be in movements or be in meetings, I’d be reading a book or pamphlet or literature and I would hear the way Jewish people were being smeared.”


  He added, “I became keenly aware of how dangerous it is if we do nothing to stand in solidarity against anti-Semitism, to stand in solidarity with Jewish people as they fight for freedom, safety, dignity and self-determination.”


  Beinart, who has for years argued that the Jewish community needs to welcome anti-Zionists, said he believes that, by the same token, “Zionist Jews should not be excluded from progressive spaces.” He also spoke of the need to combat anti-Semitism on the left.


  “It’s very important that as we fight against the greatest anti-Semitic threat, which is the threat from the white nationalist right, that we also show a great concern to make sure that progressive movements are not tainted by anti-Semitism,” he said.


  He later defended the credentials of his co-panelists, who have all been accused of anti-Semitism for their views on Israel.


  “I know that there are probably a lot of people who are watching this who came to watch it because they don’t like the folks on this panel,” he said. “Listen to the folks on this panel and what they said. Do they sound like people who hate Jews to you? Trust your gut.”


  The post At panel on anti-Semitism hosted by Jewish anti-Zionist group, panelists also say they don’t hate Jews appeared first on Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

ATK Mohun Bagan managed to get their winning groove back in the Indian Super League as they edged FC Goa 1-0 in a hard-fought contest at the Fatorda Stadium in Margao, Goa on Wednesday.


  Roy Krishna (85’) netted the winner from a spot-kick to ensure Antonio Habas’ side climbed back to the second spot on the ISL table.


  The first half belonged to the Mariners despite Goa enjoying the lion’s share of possession. They nullified the Gaurs’ attacking threat and controlled the midfield as Juan Ferrando’s side failed to register a single shot on target.


  Habas’ side, on the other hand, looked lively in attack and fashioned a couple of good chances but failed to break the deadlock.


  David Williams was presented with an early chance to put ATKMB ahead in the 9th minute. Krishna pounced on a miscued pass from Edu Bedia and played it to Pronay Halder, who chipped the ball for Williams in the box. The Australian’s lob was safely collected by Goa custodian Mohammad Nawaz, who rushed out of his line in time.


  While the hosts were happy to sit back and absorb pressure, Goa failed to penetrate the opposition defense and couldn’t test ATKMB keeper Arindam Bhattacharja.


  ATKMB once again came close to taking the lead just before halftime in what was the best chance of the game. However, they were denied by the woodwork.


  Receiving a long diagonal ball from the left, Williams cut inside by making space following a delightful touch. The striker launched a pile driver that managed to beat Nawaz but not the upright.


  Goa began the second-half with vigour and managed to create better chances. They registered their first shot on target in the 56th minute. Alexander Jesuraj whipped a cross in the box for an unmarked Noguera, whose header was straight at Nawaz.


  The Gaurs made two attacking substitutions after the hour mark, bringing on Brandon Fernandes and Jorge Ortiz Mendoza, whose arrivals provided them some much needed impetus.


  Goa had a claim for a penalty during the 79th minute but the referee did not deem it so. The tables turned just minutes later as ATKMB won a penalty at the other end and finally took the lead through Krishna, who scored his fifth Hero ISL goal of the campaign. Krishna was brought down in the box after an ill- timed tackle from substitute Aibanbha Dohling. The Fijian drilled his spot- kick hard into the bottom left-hand corner, leaving Nawaz with no chance.

  Mann was president of the American Jewish Congress in 1987 when the group adopted an unprecedented statement warning that Israel’s failure to divest itself of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip would eventually force it to choose between being a Jewish state and a democracy.


  As chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, he flew with then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Egypt to celebrate the signing of a peace treaty with the country, later falling asleep during a belly dance show.

Cousins was able to avoid an interception by holding onto the ball, but that brought its own liabilities. Up front, defensive lineman Denico Autry -- one of the league's most underrated players at his position -- looped around Buckner, who was already pressing the pocket from his side, and the result was a safety for the Colts. Eberflus is able to be so multiple with his fronts without issues on the back end because he has an amazing linebacker in Darius Leonard, and also because rookie safety Julian Blackmon has done an amazing job filling in for the injured Malik Hooker. But it's Eberflus' concepts that generally win the day for Indy's defense.

The interior is a stripped-down version of the Aventador's cabin, with carbon-fiber bucket seats and a central switch panel between the driver and passenger seating areas. Behind the open-air cabin sits Lamborghini's familiar 6.5-liter naturally aspirated V-12, making 759 horsepower in this application. It sends power to all four wheels via the same single-clutch automated paddle- shift gearbox and electronically controlled central differential.


  Since the SC20 is a one-off that's already been sold, it's unlikely Lamborghini will ever disclose pricing. It's safe to say, though, it probably wasn't cheap.


  Hopefully, its new owner will take it out for a spin once in a while. We'd love to see (and hear) it on the move.

It doesn't seem like a stretch to say that Stafford is going to be out entirely or severely limited with a painful rib injury he sustained last weekend late in the game. Chase Daniel played in his absence and led Detroit down the field, but his addition only netted Detroit three points instead of a touchdown. With Daniel theoretically getting more time to prepare this week, what will the offense look like with him at the helm completely? The Lions signed Daniel to be their backup for games like this, so he has a chance to rise to the occasion and deliver an upset, no matter how surprising that outcome might be. Detroit's offense without Stafford always looks different, so how big is the drop off this time around?

But in QAH insulators, electron flow is constrained to the edges, and electrons on one edge can only go in one direction and those on the other edge can only go the opposite direction, like splitting a road into a two-lane highway. In this study, we fabricated QAH insulators that could be layered to essentially create parallel highways on top of each other."

The revised Cherokee Nation criminal code makes it a felony to commit domestic abuse against a pregnant woman, and updates assault/battery domestic abuse laws.


  Other criminal code updates include clarifying penalties and fines for felonies and misdemeanors committed in the Cherokee Nation reservation.


  “There’s a lot at stake after this court ruling and it’s important our Cherokee Nation laws reflect these changes and challenges ahead,” said Tribal Councilor Mike Shambaugh, who is on the commission and is a police chief in Jay. “Our goal is to maintain our sovereignty and close jurisdictional gaps while ensuring continued justice.”


  Cherokee Nation criminal code regarding the Controlled Substance Act is now more consistent with state law, so tribal citizens will not be penalized for acts that are legal under Oklahoma law. This will help tribal citizens and business owners in the cannabis industry avoid tribal criminal prosecution if they are fully complying with Oklahoma law.

WEAKENING ECONOMY


  The apparent breakthrough comes at a key moment for a U.S. economy that is clearly weakening after an initial rebound from a historic recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year. Consumer spending, buoyed through the summer and early fall by the first rounds of federal assistance totaling more than US$3 trillion, has hit a wall in the fourth quarter as new restrictions to thwart COVID-19 limit business activity and households begin to hunker down.


  Commerce Department data on Wednesday showed retail sales fell unexpectedly sharply in November, with consumer outlays on goods and services showing softness across the board.


  As lawmakers worked on the deal, officials at the U.S. Federal Reserve were also meeting to debate whether additional stimulus from the central bank was also warranted. The Fed has already cut interest rates to near zero and is buying US$120 billion of bonds a month to ensure borrowing costs for consumers and businesses remain cheap and help encourage spending.


  Fed policymakers will unveil their decision on Wednesday afternoon. Chair Jerome Powell - who has repeatedly said additional fiscal stimulus is needed to support the economy until the time a vaccine is in broad enough use to encourage consumers to come out of their shells - will discuss the Fed's decision afterward at a news conference.

And if a donor approaches an organization explaining their initial gift is going to be a “test,” Hargraft said the developmental team should address their reasoning for the “test.”


  “I’d first explain that it is important information to have, and then ask for them to tell me the things they expect to see and what they don’t want to see come from the donation at all,” she noted. “Tell me about all of the things you don’t like and the experiences you had in the past that made you explore an opportunity like this.”


  Hargraft added it is key that organizations also know how to “pass the test,” too.


  “Tests are only fair when you know what you’re being tested on,” she said. “So, I’d ask what a successful outcome for them would be. And then create a plan to work towards that. Having gifts like this opens up conversations with donors. You get to make sure you’re super transparent, learning what their expectations are and being honest if you can meet them or not.”


  And finding that sweet spot where donors can navigate the philanthropic waters and make sure their dollars make a difference is where “test” gifts shine, Fisher said.


  “These gifts are important to allow donors and organizations to become better acquainted and make sure their values align,” she said. “When donors and nonprofits are on the same page, donor retention naturally increases.”


  Rayburn stated, “At its core, philanthropy is the intersection of what a donor wants to do with their money that is meaningful to them and the work of the organization. When we successfully find that sweet spot, support usually moves from transactional giving to transformative giving levels which is ultimately the most rewarding place for a donor. This is where they can see exactly how their investment is making a difference in the lives of others, the community and the future.”

Roush Fenway Racing has announced that Castrol, who joined the team prior to the 2020 season, has expanded its partnership with Jack Roush’s championship organization in 2021 and beyond. In addition to serving as the team’s official oil partner, Castrol will serve as a primary on both Ryan Newman and Chris Buescher’s Cup Series entries in select events. “We are very pleased to have Castrol expand their program with Roush Fenway,” said NASCAR Hall-of-Fame owner Jack Roush. “Castrol is one of the most recognized brands in the world and has been synonymous with high engine performance for decades. We consider it a distinct advantage to utilize their products in our Fords on the race track and look forward to growing the program off the track as well.” Roush Fenway will continue to run Castrol Motor Oil exclusively in all of its Ford machines, with its 2021 debut as a primary partner coming at the Daytona Road Course on February 21 on Newman’s No. 6 Ford. The brand will also serve as the primary for the No. 6 team at the spring Talladega race, the Charlotte Roval and the season finale at Ford Championship weekend in Phoenix. Buescher’s No. 17 will carry the iconic Castrol colors at Atlanta and Michigan in July and August. Castrol will also be featured as an associate partner throughout the 2021 NASCAR season on both cars. “Roush Fenway has been an outstanding partner over the last year and continuing this partnership was something we were very keen to do,” said Rayne Pacek, Castrol’s Vice President Marketing. “We are excited to continue to bring both fans and customers unique opportunities to get to know Ryan and Chris, as well as enhance the Castrol and Roush Fenway brands over the next two racing seasons”. Roush Fenway and Castrol teamed up to win a prestigious MarCom Platinum Award in their debut season in 2020 for their work promoting the brand’s Garage Life platform, which highlighted Newman’s off-track hobbies during the early weeks of the COVID-19 shutdown. Entering 2021, the brand will continue to feature Newman and Buescher with unique social content geared to engage the NASCAR and car culture fan base. Newman, who completed his 19th full Cup season in 2020, drove the Castrol Ford to a 15th-place run early in the year at Bristol and improved on that with a 13th-place finish in the summer at Michigan with Castrol on board. Newman enters his 20th full season in NASCAR’s top series in 2020, and third behind the wheel of Jack Roush’s iconic No. 6 machine. He enters 2021 with 263 career top-10s, including 115 finishes inside the top five, and 18 wins. Buescher, a five-year Cup veteran, embarks on his second season in the seat of the No. 17 Ford. The Texas native is fresh off a campaign that brought him eight top-10 finishes, doubling his previous career- high dating back five years. RFR PR

AVERY ISLAND — One miner is still missing as rescuers sift through the rubble from a roof collapse that occurred at the Cargill Salt Mine in Avery Island Monday morning.
 The body of a second miner missing after the collapse was found Tuesday, according to a statement Cargill, the mine’s operator, released Tuesday afternoon.
 “Cargill is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in our community,” according to a statement sent from Daniel Sullivan, media relations director for Cargill Salt. “I can confirm that this morning the rescue team recovered one of the missing miners who was fatally injured in the accident. We are continuing to do everything we can to locate the other team member with whom we have not had contact since the accident.”
 The names of the two miners have not been released.
 “Out of respect for the families, we will not be sharing further details about the employees at this time,” the statement continued. “Our sympathy is with the family who is mourning the loss of a loved one and we are offering support to them.”
 There were 18 employees on shift at the time of the collapse. The other 16 employees were evacuated without any reported injuries.
 The facility has been shut down while rescue operations and an investigation into the incident are underway. According to a statement from the company, local rescue workers and members of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration are on site.
 The rescue operations continued overnight Monday into Tuesday.
 “Throughout the day we have been relocating critical equipment to aid in the search and rescue efforts,” said Sullivan in a statement around midnight Monday. “Our mine rescue teams are advancing to the location of the collapse to secure the site underground and intend to work through the night. Our immediate focus is on the two missing miners and the safety of the rescue personnel.”
 Shaft and gallery mines, such as the salt mine at Avery Island, report directly to the federal MSHA, part of the U.S. Department of Labor. Unlike surface or injection mines, there are no state or local agencies which monitor or control those sub-surface operations.
 According to a Department of Labor spokesman, MSHA was notified of the roof collapse and the ongoing operations to rescue the missing mine employees Monday morning. The spokesman said an MSHA investigation into the collapse is underway.
 A search of the MSHA’s mine safety database showed that Cargill has had 52 safety citations during the last year. Those citations were primarily minor issues, according to the fines assessed.
 One, on Dec. 3, cited the mine for “ground conditions that create a hazard to persons shall be taken down or supported before other work or travel is permitted in the affected area. Until corrective work is completed, the area shall be posted with a warning against entry and, when left unattended, a barrier shall be installed to impede unauthorized entry.”
 When asked about the issue, Sullivan said that it was not related to Monday’s collapse.
 “That citation is referring to a different level and part of the mine,” Sullivan replied. “While we are still investigating the cause of (the) roof collapse, there is no indication it is related to the inspection issues identified in the recent MSHA citations.”
 The Avery Island mine is one of three salt mines operated by Cargill in the United States, and is the only salt mine it operates in Louisiana. In addition to the Avery Island salt mine, Cargill also operates a salt evaporation facility in Breaux Bridge.
 The Avery Island mine produces deicing salt that is used to keep roads safe and clear during the winter months throughout the U.S. and Canada. It has been operating since the mid-1800s and was the first rock salt mine in North America.
 Avery Island Inc., a company formed by the Avery and McIlhenny families, owns the mine. Cargill has managed the mine’s operations since 1997.
 The facility employs nearly 200 workers producing more than 2 million tons of salt a year.
 In addition to the search and rescue efforts, Sullivan said the company is providing support for employees and rescuers as well at the site.
 “We are working around the clock with the Mine Safety and Health Administration to safely complete the rescue efforts,” the statement continued. “We care about our teammates and have professional grief counselors on site at our facility who will be available to our team as needed. The safety and well-being of our colleagues is our top priority. We are grieving with the community as we face this loss together.”

This is why today's atomic clocks are designed to measure a gas composed of thousands of the same type of atom, in order to get an estimate of their average oscillations. A typical atomic clock does this by first using a system of lasers to corral a gas of ultracooled atoms into a trap formed by a laser. A second, very stable laser, with a frequency close to that of the atoms' vibrations, is sent to probe the atomic oscillation and thereby keep track of time.

_Cobra Kai_ 's gearing up for Season 3 on Netflix soon, and this new trailer makes good on Ralph Macchio's previous promise to us: "The best is yet to come in this series! And I believe in that." The emotional stakes are certainly high. After Johnny and Daniel's combined bad moves contributed heavily to Miguel landing in a hospital bed, Johnny's looking for redemption. While he does the hard work in the hospital -- and Kreese re-takes the dubious reigns of the Cobra Kai dojo, which makes me worried about him instructing Hawk to be even more of an anger-bear monster -- Daniel-san heads to Okinawa, where an old rival is ready for him. The soul and fate of every sensei (and their students) are up for grabs. Hopefully, they'll all make the right moves.

"We do see some dissipation of current at connection points between QAH insulators and metallic electrodes, which occurs in the form of heat," said Liu. "You can think of it like the on and off ramps of a busy highway, where the narrow merge lane into local traffic slows you down. By building more parallel highways, more merge lanes can connect the highways to local traffic, so that the overall speed of the whole traffic system can be greatly improved."
