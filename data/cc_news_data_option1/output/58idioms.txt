Give going dark a try. I bet it does the same for you. Live your own life, worry about your own problems, and let others worry about theirs. Find joy connecting with real friends, not angst watching hordes of digital simulacra doing St. Vitus's dance to the tune of a dysfunctional and desperate media industry in its death throes. If you have a mind to, build your own personal intellectual oasis populated with whomever you choose. And rest assured that despite being told otherwise you will cease being part of the problem to the extent that you stop believing you must be part of every solution.

Trump's decision to take out a top Iranian general has thrust foreign policy into the forefront of the news cycle. On paper, a foreign policy focus should help Biden, who has decades of experience on the world's stage. But that long record includes a series of controversial decisions — none bigger than his 2002 vote to authorize military force against Iraq — that could hurt him. Can Biden's less-experienced rivals capitalize? Can Biden finally put the Iraq vote behind him? There are risks, but it remains to be seen how much Democratic primary voters who are hyper-focused on domestic issues will ultimately care.                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

_Cleanness_ is a sublime book, transcending not only autofiction or LGBTQ writing, but the very barrier between stories and novel, fiction and non- fiction. And like Greenwell's multifaceted writing, both story and lived experience, both intimate and sweeping, in reading _Cleanness_ I found a dissonance in my reaction; upon finishing a chapter, I was filled with both the desire to hurry to the next one and just ruminate on the story finished, to revel in the world and feelings it painted for me. I'm sure this is a book I'll read several times over, in the coming years, trying to extract every last bit of meaning in that treasured space between when one story ends and another begins. Hopefully, after a few times through, Greenwell will have more writing for me to pour over. Whether Greenwell's next work returns once more to the gray and beautiful country of Bulgaria, or chooses to venture into new lands, I know it's somewhere can't wait to visit, and in all likelihood won't want to leave.

McCarthy stopped short of calling Democratic President Harry Truman a conspirator working with the Communists to undermine America.

If you think "fevered" is too strong or loaded a word, wait until you see McCarthy in the documentary when he is in high dudgeon talking about Communists as skunks and rats.

Using the technology of their day, McCarthy's team used the same kind of manipulated images to attack opponents.                                  McCarthy was not up for re-election in 1950, but Maryland senator Millard Tydings was. Like Trump, McCarthy held grudges big time and tried to personally destroy those he held them against. One of the people against whom he held a major grudge, according to Oshinsky's book, was Tydings for the role the Democrat played on a Senate subcommittee that investigated McCarthy's tactics.                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The final seconds of the 2016 national title game were some of the most dramatic in college basketball history.
 North Carolina's Marcus Paige hit an off-balance 3-pointer to tie the game with 4.7 seconds left, only to be upstaged by Villanova's Kris Jenkins hitting a buzzer-beating, game-winning 3-pointer.
 Amid all the drama, Villanova coach Jay Wright remained calm. When Jenkins let go of his shot, Wright nonchalantly said "Bang," then walked over to shake Tar Heels coach Roy Williams' hand as if the Wildcats had just won an exhibition game, not a national championship.
 Smooth as one of his designer suits, Wright turned Villanova into a national powerhouse during the 2010s, leading the Wildcats to two national titles while changing the way college basketball is played.
 Wright's success on the outskirts of Philadelphia made him a runaway choice as men's coach of the decade. He received 16 of 24 votes from a panel of Associated Press poll voters, well ahead of Duke's Mike Krzyzewski with five votes. Gonzaga's Mark Few, Kentucky's John Calipari and Virginia's Tony Bennett had one each.
 "Jay Wright's resume speaks for itself with two national titles in the 2010s," ESPN analyst and AP voter Dick Vitale said. "He has developed a consistent winner and has enjoyed success on and off the court. He has a special winner's mentality."
 The decade included summer visits to Little Falls, New York, where Wright's son Taylor pitched for the Mohawk Valley DiamondDawgs during the 2012 and 2013 Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League seasons while attending Brown University.

Clip your baby’s nails as you would your own, gently pushing back the fingertip from the nail to allow space for the clipper. This helps prevent clipping your baby’s finger. Short little clips above the white nail line will help prevent clipping too close. For toenails, clip straight across. Keep a firm hold on your child’s hand (or foot) as you clip. You can also use scissor-shaped clippers or manicure scissors. Smooth rough edges with an emery board.

That movement is largely due to advances in brain science. Neuroscientists have discovered that the juvenile brain is not fully developed until a person reaches their mid-20s. Each individual matures at their own pace. Neglect in early childhood can hinder brain development. Exposure to violence and trauma can wire the brain for heightened anxiety, even aggression. No matter the particulars of childhood, all juveniles lack a fully developed prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that allows us to pause and reflect, delaying a possible bad decision. In the teenage years, the social and emotional system of the brain rapidly blooms, faster than cognitive control, setting up a phase in which adolescents take risks, seek peer approval and leap on and off emotional cliffs.                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The Congress will be lodging a complaint with the cyber crime police here against the misleading dial-in campaign for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).                                  After the BJP’s national leadership invited missed calls to a toll-free number from the general public to gain support for the issue, the saffron party’s IT cell allegedly began a misleading campaign to lure people, claimed Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) spokesperson M. Lakshmana.                                  At a press conference here on Monday, he alleged that the BJP’s IT cell had created about 3,000 such misleading tweets with offers ranging from chats with “lonely women” to free Netflix subscription to a chat with Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt to the people calling the toll-free number.                                  Though a complaint has been lodged by All India Congress Committee (AICC) at the national level, Mr. Lakshmana said the party’s Mysuru unit will also lodge a complaint.                                  He also described as a “bundle of lies” a pamphlet distributed by the BJP leaders as part of the campaign in favour of CAA. “They have conveniently ignored the chaos CAA will cause in the society when implemented along with National Register of Citizens (NRC)”, he said before adding that the Congress will also soon launch a campaign to create awareness among the people about the actual impact of the legislations on the society.                                  Varuna Assembly constituency MLA Yathindra Siddaramaiah cited the difficulties faced by people in Assam, who had been left out of the NRC list, as an example of the threat posed to people in the rest of the country. “Both Muslims and Hindus had been left out of the NRC list in Assam recently”, he said. Also, CAA provides citizenship only to minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. “Why has the government left out the migrants from Sri Lanka?’, Mr Yathindra asked.                                  The laws will put into jeopardy the lives of not only Muslims, but also a large number of poor, Dalits and tribals in the country, he added.                                  KPCC spokesperson Manjula Manasa, who was present on the occasion, accused the BJP leaders and supporters of painting as “anti-nationals” the people who question the government’s actions. She also accused the BJP of sowing the seeds of communal poison in the minds of the people through people like Ballari MLA Somashekar Reddy while strongly condemning his utterances in Ballari recently.                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump insists that Iranian cultural sites are fair game for the U.S. military, dismissing concerns within his own administration that doing so could constitute a war crime under international law. He also warned Iraq that he would levy punishing sanctions if it expelled American troops in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad that killed a top Iranian official.
 But Congress is pushing back, in what's expected to be a pivotal week as lawmakers return from a holiday recess. On Monday, two top Senate Democrats called on Trump to immediately declassify the administration’s reasoning for the strike on the Iranian official, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, saying there is “no legitimate justification” for keeping the information from the public.
 And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late Sunday the House would introduce and vote this week on a war powers resolution to limit the president’s military actions regarding Iran. In a letter to House Democrats, Pelosi called the airstrike “provocative and disproportionate” and said it had “endangered our servicemembers, diplomats and others by risking a serious escalation of tensions with Iran.” A similar resolution was introduced in the Senate.
 Congress, which has the sole power to declare war, has complained that Trump did not provide advance notice of his airstrike on Soleimani in Baghdad. Trump did meet the 48-hour deadline required by the War Powers Act to notify Congress after the deadly drone strike, though the document was classified and no public version was released.
 The administration is expected to brief lawmakers on its actions this week.
 In their letter to Trump, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and the Senate Foreign Relation Committee’s Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey said the White House’s classified notification sent to Congress late Saturday under the War Powers Act was insufficient and inappropriate.
 “It is critical that national security matters of such import be shared with the American people in a timely manner, they wrote. “An entirely classified notification is simply not appropriate in a democratic society.” They asked that the notification be declassified “in full.”
 Pelosi said the notification “raises more questions than it answers. This document prompts serious and urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification of the Administration’s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran.”
 Iran has vowed to retaliate for Trump's targeted killing of Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds force. It has sparked outrage in the Middle East, including in Iraq, where more than 5,000 American troops are still on the ground 17 years after the U.S. invasion. Iraq’s parliament voted Sunday in favour of a nonbinding resolution calling for the expulsion of the American forces.
 Trump first raised the prospect of targeting Iranian cultural sites Saturday in a tweet. Speaking with reporters Sunday as he flew back to Washington from his holiday in Florida, he refused to back down, despite international prohibitions.
 “They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way,” Trump said.
 On Iraq, Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t leave Iraq without being paid for its military investments there over the years — then said if the troops do have to withdraw, he would hit Baghdad with economic penalties.
 “We will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame,” he said. “If there’s any hostility, that they do anything we think is inappropriate, we are going to put sanctions on Iraq, very big sanctions on Iraq.”
 He added: “We’re not leaving until they pay us back for it.”
 The administration has scrambled to contend with the backlash to the killing of Soleimani, which marked a stark escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran.
 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. military may well strike more Iranian leaders if the Islamic Republic retaliates. He tip-toed around questions about Trump’s threat to attack Iranian cultural sites, a military action that likely would be illegal under the laws of armed conflict and the U.N. charter.
 Pompeo defended the targeted killing of Soleimani, saying the administration would have been “culpably negligent” in its duty to protect the United States if it had not killed him.
 He did not provide evidence for his previous claims that Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks on Americans. Instead of arguing that an attack had been imminent, Pompeo said it was inevitable.

The venue has been designed to seat nearly 200 people in three screens with 34, 56 and 94 seats respectively. The cinema would also include a licensed café bar with spectacular sea views.
 The proposals have proved divisive so far with some in favour of redevelopment and others passionately opposed.
 As things stand, the Independent/Lib Dem administration is putting its weight behind the plan to replace the crumbling current cinema with a new three- screen, 184-seat cinema complex.
 But the proposals have come under fire from Labour opposition , which has argued that the Art Deco seafront building should be saved .
 Speaking in October, Redcar councillor Carl Quartermain said: "This announcement is deeply disappointing given the depth of public love and support for the Regent Cinema building.
 "The cinema is iconic and unique, the last remaining in the Art Deco style to stand on a seafront and the Independent/Lib Dem administration should be doing all they can to protect it."

 Trump doubles down on threat to Iran cultural sites
 US President Donald Trump doubled down Sunday on a threat to attack Iranian cultural sites despite accusations that any such strike would amount to a war crime. After his top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, had insisted that any military action would conform to international law, Trump said he would regard cultural sites as fair game if Iran resorted to deadly force against US targets.

Situated at the crossroads between the ancient lands of the Arabian Peninsula and Mesopotamia, Al Ain is considered to be one of the world’s oldest inhabited settlements, with a nearly 8,000-year-old history. It is proof of the existence of prehistoric cultures in a desert region dating from the ancient times, and also a symbol of the resilience of the Bedouin people who were able to endure the harsh desert environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  										                                                                                                                                    *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

 “We don’t receive any public funding for the upkeep of the building, so, as the theatre gets older, we are relying more and more on donations and the fundraising of the Friends of the Grand.”
 The 125th year anniversary also saw the theatre make history with the launch of its own production company Blackpool Grand Productions Limited, and the opening of their own summer show, Around the World In 80’s Days.
 As well as the birthday celebrations, the team has run a number of fund- raising activities, from special events, selling limited edition 125 Rose Gold Lapel Badges, running a year-long raffle and offering a “pay what you feel” for certain shows during the year, with the proceeds going to the Grand charity.

Chris Wig's letter (Dec. 30) supports the Lane Community College $145 million "remodel" job. I've supported all of the LCC and school district bonds for years, but as time goes by, I think that taxpayers grow weary of supporting unnecessary expenditures that strain some people's budgets and take away from their quality of life.                                                                                                                                                                                                          A story reported that the LCC project (Dec. 22) adds a cost-per-month to each household equal to the price of a fancy coffee. I highly doubt that, but that's not the point. It's not just the property tax increases of $200-plus each year. There's also the rise in the cost of food, home and car insurance, medical insurance, cable TV and utilities. I even have to pay for the rain that flows from my roof. They call it "stormwater."
