KINGSTON - With senior Chase Perkins reaching the All-State tournament, the Silver Lake wrestling team enjoyed its finest season in school history. The Lakers finished 17-10 in dual meet competition, and Perkins was one of three wrestlers selected to the Patriot League All-Star team.
 "This is the best record the team had dual meet-wise since the high school split into Pembroke and Silver Lake," head coach Wayne Reissfelder said.
 Perkins, competing at 160 pounds, advanced to the All-States by finishing fourth in both the Division 2 South Sectionals and the Div. 2 state meet. He had 34 wins, including one of the team's biggest of the season, pulling an upset in a match against Whitman-Hanson that was the difference in a 42-40 victory.
 "He was quite a surprise for us," Reissfelder said. "We knew he had potential, and he really put in the work in the weight room and the wrestling room."
 Junior Kyle Cipullo won 30 matches and also earned a spot on the league all- stars after advancing to the sectional finals at 220 pounds.
 "We expected him to be one of the better wrestlers on the South Shore," Reissfelder said. "In the sectionals, he ran into a kid from Plymouth North (AJ Dias) who ended up second in the states. But he was a big part of why we were 17-10."
 Junior Scott Snell, 18-8 competing mostly at 106, was also honored, even though he was unable to compete in the postseason due to a broken nose.
 "Even with that, and even though all-stars are often determined by postseason success, the coaches put him in because they were well aware of his body of work over the season," Reissfelder said.
 The Lakers also received contributions from a number of other wrestlers. Senior William Barkowski was undefeated in the dual meet season at 152 pounds, went 19-4 overall and finished fourth at the sectionals. Senior Michael Voci, with 23 wins wrestling at 195, also took fourth at sectionals, as did junior Cam Turner, who had 21 wins at 170.
 Seniors Pat Ganley, who collected 20 wins at 126, and Will Hesketh, who split time between 220 and heavyweight, provided additional depth.
 Junior Geoff Cook played an instrumental role, wrestling at 182, nearly 20 pounds above his weight, which allowed the Lakers to fill out their lineup.
 Freshman Sydney Diauto became the first Silver Lake girl to wrestle in the state tournament, competing at 106. She went 2-2 in the girls division.

Pope John sophomore Alana Robinson was ready for a significant role change following her freshman season.
   
 After averaging 9.6 points and 9.7 rebounds per game in her first season of high school basketball, Robinson became the go-to scorer this season after the graduation of Kenna Squier -- the 2018-19 Herald Player of the Year and second all-time scorer in Sussex County history.
   
 Those were impossible shoes to fill, but Robinson was ready for the challenge. It's not easy when a player becomes the focus of every opponent they play against all of a sudden. Robinson was able to expand her game to be ready for it.
   
 She averaged 16 points, 10.4 rebounds, 3.6 blocks and 4.0 steals per game to lead Pope John to a share of a competitive NJAC National Division with Sparta and Randolph and a 19-10 record overall against one of the state's toughest schedules. Robinson is the Herald's Player of the Year for the 2019-20 season.
   
 "She answered the call from the first game," Pope John head coach John Slackman said. "She was dominant and put the team on her shoulders not just scoring but passing, rebounding and defending. She did it all for us."
   
 Last year, Robinson was mostly a low post player, but she was able to add to her offensive repertoire by improving the range on her jumper and her ability to create more off the dribble.
   
 "I got faster over the summer," Robinson said. "That helped. I've been working on my outside shot to be able to pull the defense out and to be able to drive- and-kick. I worked on a lot of stuff over the summer."
   
 The defensive numbers are as gaudy as the offensive stats for Robinson. It's rare to see any forward average the amount of steals that she did. Protecting the rim is also one of the biggest parts of Robinson's game that she takes pride in. Nothing comes easy when she is in the paint.
   
 "It just tells other teams that you're not getting anything easy," Robinson said. "Once you get that first block, they're scared to go to the rim. When they do and you get that second one, they don't want to drive anymore. They're stuck with outside shots, which have a less percentage of going in."
   
 It was only Pope John's first game of the year, but Robinson announced what kind of presence she would be in the crosstown rivalry battle at Sparta. The Lions beat the eventual Hunterdon Warren Sussex champions in a 52-49 game with Robinson leading the charge by achieving 20 points, 17 rebounds and five blocks. Without that win, Pope John would not have earned a share of the division title.
   
 "I just remember going into the locker room afterwards screaming our heads off," Robinson said. "They're a good team, so we expected a game and we got a game. To have that as our first win was great because it boosted our confidence for the year. That was probably one of our best games of the year."
   
 To open the season, Robinson had at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in five of Pope John's first seven games. Her performances did not suffer either against some of the best teams in the state. She averaged 15.5 points and 8.5 rebounds in two games against Hudson Catholic and scored 17 points against Saddle River Day.
   
 After Robinson was putting up those monster numbers, West Morris transfer Faith Pappas entered the Pope John lineup on Jan. 17. Robinson's numbers tailed off a little adding a talented player like Pappas into the mix, but it was certainly nothing that bothered Robinson since it made the Lions a better team overall.
   
 "It took a couple of games, but once we got moving I think the year went pretty well," Robinson said. "We lost a couple that we shouldn't have, but that happens. Adding Faith was another boost to our scoring. We all got on the same page and were able to keep things moving."
   
 "They got used to playing together," Slackman said. "It was a great one-two punch. This upcoming season they'll have a chance to work with each other even more. When they started playing together they started to feed off each other."
   
 That was made clear by Pope John's performance in the Non-Public, North A semifinals against Hudson Catholic. After losing to Hudson Catholic by 26 points in the regular season, Pope John fought hard until the end in a 70-64 loss the second time around.
   
 Next year, Pope John is hoping to become a team like Hudson Catholic was this year, and Robinson continuing to improve to reach her goal of becoming a Division-I player would go a long way to that.
   
 "I think it made us better," Robinson said. "That's where we want to be next year. The way we played against Hudson Catholic the second time shows that we can be that team, and we're striving to be that. I want to play against the best. I want to beat the best and I just want to show that our team can beat the best."

A $75 million rescue package was rolled out by English cricket on Tuesday to help teams at all levels withstand the financial impact of a pandemic described by a leading executive as one of the biggest challenges “in the history of the game.”
 The England and Wales Cricket Board said 40 million pounds (about $50 million) was being made available at first-class and county level from Wednesday. More than 20 million pounds (about $25 million) will go to local cricket clubs, via loans and grants.
 The start of the English cricket season has been delayed until May 28 at the earliest because of the coronavirus outbreak, with the ECB modelling a range of options for cricket to begin in June, July or August. One model takes into account the possibility of the entire 2020 campaign being canceled.
 ECB chief executive Tom Harrison said his organization was doing everything it can “to try and make sure that we keep the cricket network in business” during what he said was the sport’s biggest crisis, at least in in the modern era.
 "The aim is to give certainty in these extremely difficult times and to keep the lights on,” Harrison said. “This is just the start of addressing this massive challenge and we have to work together because every area of the game will be impacted in the event that most or all of the cricket season is lost."
 Monthly payments which would usually be passed down by the ECB in May, June and July will be issued immediately, as will two years' worth of facilities maintenance money usually ring-fenced for work on the ground and venues but which is now unrestricted.

Duguay says in his motion the report goes on to say that “the impact caused catastrophic air loss to the left front tire of the truck, which left a tire mark on the center line of the road. This tire mark had initially been attributed to an ‘unsuccessful avoidance maneuver' by Mr. Mazza, a position that the State has since retracted."
 The state attorney general's office has an April 10 deadline to respond. The court will then determine if a hearing on the motion will be scheduled. A message seeking comment was left with an office spokeswoman.
 The motion notes the state also provided information showing that Mazza had been turned around looking back at the group of riders behind him just before the accident and that autopsy reports show at the time of the crash, Mazza's blood-alcohol level was .135, well above the legal limit of .08.
 “Given the dramatically different factual circumstances as they are known at this time, Mr. Zhukovskyy respectfully requests an evidentiary hearing on the continuing need for preventative detention," Duguay wrote.
 Mazza, 59, of Lee, and the six others who died were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club, a New England group that includes Marines and their spouses. The victims were from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
 Mazza's common-law-wife had sued the trucking company that hired Zhukovskyy, saying it negligently hired him despite a troubled driving record. Her attorney, Chuck Douglas, said he had not seen the Crash Labs report and so he couldn't comment on Zhukovskyy's motion.
 The negligent homicide-DUI charges accuse Zhukovskyy of driving under the influence of a controlled drug or drugs at the time of the crash. In August, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said that a toxicology report showed Zhukovskyy was positive for an unspecified drug that made him incapable of driving safely.

 The dungeon-crawling adventure take on the immensely popular franchise will now release on May 26 instead, which means it's just slightly delayed, probably due to final polish. The new date keeps all platforms on board, with the game launching "on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Game Pass!", as Mojang enthusiastically puts it.

 El síndico de Compromís en Les Corts también ha pedido la suspensión del pago de los intereses de la deuda generada por el Fondo de Liquidez Autonómico (FLA), que en el caso valenciano, señala Ferri, "tendría un impacto mayor por el nivel de endeudamiento a través de mecanismos del Estado".
 Compromís también exige la transferencia inmediata de los 283 millones de euros de la liquidación del IVA del 2017, como "medida urgente para dotar de recursos a la Generalitat". "Son recursos propios y sobre los que Les Corts ya aprobaron una resolución reclamando su pago", añade Ferri.

[silence] And that can be a problem, since we use our sense of sound to alert ourselves to oncoming traffic and other potential dangers. So if you were, say, distracted by your phone while crossing the street and a noiseless EV was headed your way, you'd be more likely to get hit. In fact, one study shows a hybrid vehicle accelerating on its electric motor is 1.18 times more likely to hit a pedestrian and 1 1/2 times more likely to hit a cyclist than a vehicle with an internal combustion engine.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A report by an independent accident reconstruction firm shows a New Hampshire State Police account of seven motorcyclists killed in a collision with a pickup truck “was deeply flawed" and concludes that one of the bikers struck the pickup, the truck driver's lawyer said in court documents.
 Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 24, of West Springfield, Massachusetts, was indicted last year on multiple counts of negligent homicide and driving under the influence in the June 21 crash in Randolph. He's been in jail since and pleaded not guilty. Jury selection for his trial is scheduled for November.
 Zhukovskyy's pickup truck, towing a flatbed trailer, was traveling west and the motorcyclists were traveling east on a two-lane road.
 The motion seeking a bail hearing, filed Friday and made public Tuesday, said state police initially determined that the trailer was 1.5 feet over the center line into the eastbound lane at the time of impact.
 The motion said the state recently disclosed a report from Crash Labs, an independent accident reconstruction firm, which shows the state police initial assessment “was deeply flawed," according to the motion filed by defense lawyer Jay Duguay.
 Crash Labs “determined that the impact occurred directly over the center line" and that the motorcycle driven by Albert “Woody" Mazza Jr. “was in fact protruding over onto the center line when it struck the truck," according to the motion. It said the initial impact occurred between the left side of Mazza's motorcycle and the left front tire of Zhukovskyy’s truck.

Technical chart claims that Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMRX) would settle between $3.21/share to $3.34/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $2.97 mark, then the market for Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $2.86 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.27. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.
