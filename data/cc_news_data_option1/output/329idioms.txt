It is rather unfortunate and painful that the same sons, who made several attempts during my husband’s lifetime to keep him miserable and also threatened his life unless they were settled, are now alleging a case of murder against me. Why? Because I stood firmly as one with my darling husband? Lovingly took care and spared nothing to ensure that he received the best round the clock medical care from the best doctors and nurses wherever available in England, Nigeria, United States of America, Lebanon and other countries? I leave this matter to the God of justice to plead my cause and avenge for me.

 “I knew I had to knock at least one of those free throws down,” He said. “We got the one point and that’s what got us the W.”
 Hunter Blaha finished with 10 points, nine rebounds and four assists for Owosso (1-8, 1-7 Flint Metro League Stars). He made a critical 3-point play 45 seconds left, scoring underneath and adding a free throw. Carson Socia tied the game 47 with a field goal with approximately 30 seconds to go.
 “We played as a team and we’ve been building on the fundamentals since Day 1,” Blaha said.
 Socia and Mieske each finished with 12 points for Corunna (3-7, 1-7 Flint Metro Stars). Socia had seven steals, while Mieske had five assists. Nick Steinacker had eight points, but fouled out late in the fourth quarter.
 Caleb Stahr had seven rebounds and joined Scout Jones with six points.
 Corunna coach Rocky Buscemi said his team was just looking to get a quick open look at the end.
 “It was an exciting game and what you wish every high school game were like,” he said. “Obviously it means a lot to both schools. But we’re not defining ourselves by this game today. At the end of the day, if Cole’s shot goes in at the end there and we win by one, does that change how we played in the moment? In a game this tight, it’s great to be in it because those are the types of games that help you in March.”
 Owosso also featured Eddie Mishler’s eight points, 10 rebounds and five assists. Charles Poag scored six points, all in the fourth quarter.
 “It was a great Friday night for high school basketball,” Owosso coach Dave Owens said. “Both teams played hard, they competed hard. The fans I thought were into the game. It was just a great high school environment. It’s a game that you hope you’re on the right end of the scoreboard, because anybody could have won. It’s great for our kids.”
 The game featured a large, raucous crowd at Owosso. It was tied 9-9 after one quarter before Owosso eked ahead 26-24 at halftime. Corunna regained control, 38-34 after three quarters, but the Trojans closed with a 14-9 finish in the fourth.

The franchisee-driven leagues have not only changed the life of sportsmen, but also the spectators. The loyalty factor has led to a new fan following for sports with the youth looking forward to cheer for their heroes even when they are not playing for the country. “I don’t miss the league competitions because there is so much to savour and enjoy. True, there is nothing like a country versus country contest but I have grown watching these leagues and accept them as much for their competition as entertainment,” remarked Ashwin Krishnan, a sports consultant.
 How these leagues have helped individual sports and the players — past and present — is an interesting case study. They have created niche followers and also the desire to perform consistently well among sportsmen. “If you are not consistent and don’t deliver your price falls at the next auction,” says former India hockey star Jagbir Singh.
 The flip side of these leagues is the death of traditional tournaments. State championships have lost their relevance as players are noticed for their showing in these leagues. “There is a dearth of good tournaments at the domestic level. You can’t always depend on these leagues to throw up talented faces. There is little work at the ground level because everyone is struck by money and glamour,” argued Ashok Kumar, who spends time coaching junior girls in Ajmer.
 There are many who feel the proliferation of leagues has helped Indian sport grow. “At the end of the day, you have to run the kitchen of your house and that comes from the earning from these leagues. I don’t agree that there is a lack of quality competition. Look at cricket, badminton, football. They are as good as you can get. You get to see some top foreign players. In any case, how are they harming your traditional sports? Would kabaddi have become so popular without the idea of a league which is so well projected on television?” insisted Krishnan, who is acknowledged for his skills as venue manager in the IPL.
 Sporting leagues in the last decade have given the Indian spectator some exciting stuff to enjoy at the venue and on television. The players, past and present, have carved professional careers for themselves. There are job opportunities for the players and the organisers and it is a thriving industry. “The earnings from these leagues (selling merchandise) helps us sustain ourselves for the year. There is some work or other for everyone,” said Kuldeep Singh, who sells t-shirts and franchisee flags during the sporting season.
 The sporting profile has witnessed huge changes in the way one plays and watches the games. Watching sporting leagues on television is an addiction for the youth but as a veteran sports lover observed, “There is nothing like enjoying the contests at the venues.”

Stewart imposed consecutive sentencing on one count of aggravated possession of CSAM and one count of using a computer to commit a crime. Sentencing for the other counts will run concurrent with the consecutive sentences.
 Lauderdale was arrested Aug. 30, 2019, following an investigation by Michigan State Police, and arraigned the same day in 66th District Court before Judge Ward Clarkson; he pleaded not guilty. Lauderdale has been lodged at the Shiawassee County Jail since that time while awaiting disposition of the charges.
 Prosecutors originally charged Lauderdale with the CSAM and using a computer to commit a crime counts, along with first-degree CSC.
 At a plea hearing Nov. 21, 2019, Lauderdale pleaded guilty to the above charges, and prosecutors reduced the CSC to a third-degree offense.
 “Aside from the immediate harm a sex offense has on a child, the problem the court has with child molesters or pedophiles, or whatever you want to call them, is the long-term effect it has, not only on the child, but that child invariably will have relationship problems of their own,” Stewart said. “For a brief moment of self-gratification, you caused long-term damage, not only to this victim, but the people this victim will have relationships with. There’s no cure. A child cannot be un-molested. A child cannot be un-traumatized. Now this child has a lifetime of pain.”

“ The Nigerian Police knows that I did not kill my husband. They have evidence that shows that we had planned to travel to Ghana on the 26th of December 2018 after departing the annual Oruwari Briggs Thanksgiving, which my husband, as Paramount Head of the Oruwari Briggs War Canoe House presided over at our family compound in Abonnema. An email trail stating that VistaJet had a technical problem confirmed our rescheduled flight for the next day 27th of December 2018. Eyewitnesses would testify that when we arrived back at Sombreiro House from Abonnema on the 26th of December 2018, my husband was upset because we had planned to go straight to the airport. As a matter of fact, he refused to alight from the car until I pleaded with him for several minutes. Accordingly, we got to the airport the next day and boarded the flight as usual. It was only after I inquired what was holding us down that I was told that VistaJet had not yet received a new landing permit for the rescheduled flight. The processing of another landing permit for Accra took time because it was a festive period and most workers were not at work. Ordinarily, it is not the passenger’s duty to secure landing permits. I took the initiative to help expedite the process. The Nigerian Police has all the papers/documents including a letter from VistaJet detailing all of the actions that were taken to secure the landing rights. The engines were running, and the aircraft was air conditioned and very comfortable. My husband never felt uncomfortable, as there was no difference in the plane’s condition from when it was flying. The delay was not up to 5 hours as alleged by Dumo. Indeed, my husband took me to Singapore to celebrate my 60th birthday with friends and family just a couple of months before his demise. The flight time was over 22 hours each way via a chartered flight operated by the same private jet company. My husband was very okay. Furthermore, the pathologists confirmed that if my husband died a violent death of suffocation or strangulation, it would have physically been observed the moment his body was torn apart.

“My people, can’t you see that the Coroner was deceived by Dumo’s false misrepresentations to her? If the issue was the delay of the autopsy report, why didn’t the Coroner, being the same court that ordered the first autopsy, issue an order to the Military Hospital to submit the autopsy report to her? She rather ordered for an inquest, which would entail a second autopsy. This got all of us worried and it is the reason we went to the High court to seek that the Military be ordered to submit the autopsy report in a transparent manner. More so, it is not true as Dumo said that the High Court cannot ask the Military Hospital questions on the report during the submission. Dumo was economical with the truth when he said such examination and cross-examination can only be done at the Coroner’s court. The Coroner’s Court is a lower court and only a court of first instance. It is not the Supreme Court whose actions are not appealable.

The site has been toured by several local officials.
 “The manager took me through the purchasing area and I was very impressed with the security measures, tracking process, and chain of custody policies. My experience with Lume management and employees thus far leads me to believe they will be an excellent business citizens in our downtown,” Owosso City Manager Nathen Henne said.
 The building is divided into three main sections for convenience and security. When a patient first walks in, they enter the “intake room.” There they are greeted by a “Luminary” and someone will check their identification and their medical marijuana card.
 If either is expired patients will be turned away.
 After they are checked in, they are taken through a secure door to the room displaying all of the various products in different display cases.
 The location employs a “bud bar” similar to craft breweries. Prices are displayed on screens that coordinate with the product on display. The prices vary from roughly $10 to $20 a gram — depending on quality.
 “We have three different tier systems, value, mid and top tier,” Lume general manager Douglass McLaughlin-Williams said.
 Currently, Lume is running a launch special where every eighth of an ounce of marijuana (3.5 grams) is $30.
 After selecting a product, a patient will place their order. The third section of the building is a fulfillment center. Similar to a pharmacy, workers behind glass windows prepare the patient’s order — and then they are out the door.
 Besides selling marijuana flower, Lume also sells edibles, tinctures and concentrates along with some other marijuana-based products.
 One notable thing that makes their product top-tier, McLaughlin-Williams said, is the way it’s packaged. Everything is sealed using nitrogen instead of regular air to ensure the product remains fresh for two years.
 Every product sold in Lume also has to go through a stringent testing process by a state-approved tester that checks for things such as mold and pesticides in the product.
 Beside its Owosso location, Lume also operates dispensaries in Kalamazoo, Honor, and Evart.
 Beginning Feb. 1 the company will begin delivering from the Evart location, and if the Owosso City Council approves home delivery in the city, Hellyar said he expects the Owosso location to do the same.
 Evart is where the companies growing facilities are located. They currently hold nine class-C growing licenses, which allows them to grow up to 13,500 plants at any given time.
 From Evart, the product is sent to a testing facility and then distributed to one of Lume’s dispensaries.
 McLaughlin-Williams said that currently, almost all of the product on the shelves at Lume is grown at their Evart location. Their goal is to vertically integrate themselves into the market, controlling the process from seed to sale. Hellyar said this will help them achieve the high standards they have become known for.
 Hellyar said that what sets Lume apart from some of its competitors is the fact the owners are Michigan-based.
 “There are a lot of out of state operators coming into Michigan. We are a Michigan-based company that is only focused on Michigan,” Hellyar said.

For 15 years, Yere Goud made the Karnail Singh Stadium in the heart of Delhi his home. On Saturday he was back, this time leading the Karnataka side and trying to plot defeat for the host and his erstwhile team Railways.
 Karnataka has had a good beginning to the season, winning both the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20) and the Vijay Hazare (one-dayers) and then the opening Ranji Trophy game before hitting a hurdle and drawing the next two at home.
 A win and then another draw following on highlight the team’s struggles to find consistency. Goud, who took charge last season, is hoping to hit the right notes as the competition enters the business end.
 “It feels good, sort of homecoming for me. More than 100 games for Railways, 15 years on this ground, it is special. Harvinder Singh on the opposite bench makes it more special, we were together when Railways won those two titles and are still part of the Railways veterans group, so it is good to match up on field,” Goud said while overseeing the team’s first practice session here.
 Of the 105 Ranji matches Goud played for Railways, 49 were at this ground, with 2654 runs at an average of 42.12. No wonder, he knows every area of the field as well as anyone. How much have things changed? “Well, the pitch has been relaid and so is expected to be different. But other than that, nothing’s changed here since back then. It’s more or less just the same as I left it,” he smiled.

The Daily Express called this late-2019 clash a “horror show.” This BBC interview, with surging fears of public anti-Semitism, lingered in headlines as Brits went to the polls. Corbyn’s party suffered its worst defeat in nearly a century.
 Meanwhile, in America, a wave of anti-Semitic attacks left Jews wondering if it was safe to wear yarmulkes and symbols of their faith while walking the sidewalks of New York City. In suburban Monsey, New York, a machete-waving attacker stabbed five people at a Hasidic rabbi’s Hanukkah party. Finally, thousands of New Yorkers marched to show solidarity with the Jewish community.
 The NYPD estimates that anti-Semitic crimes rose 26 percent last year. Anti- Semitic hate crimes in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are expected to hit an 18-year high, according to research at California State University, San Bernardino.
 No one who watches the news can doubt that “the darkness has returned. It has returned likewise to virtually every country in Europe,” argued Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, who led the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth from 1991 to 2013. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2005 and entered the House of Lords.
 “That this should have happened within living memory of the Holocaust, after the most systematic attempt ever made … to find a cure for the virus of the world’s longest hate — more than half a century of Holocaust education and anti-racist legislation — is almost unbelievable. It is particularly traumatic that this has happened in the United States, the country where Jews felt more at home than anywhere else in the Diaspora.”
 Why now? In an essay for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Rabbi Sacks urged religious and political leaders to study tends — often digital — behind these tragedies.
 “Anti-Semitism, or any hate,” he argued, “becomes dangerous in any society when three things happen: when it moves from the fringes of politics to a mainstream party and its leadership; when the party sees that its popularity with the general public is not harmed thereby; and when those who stand up and protest are vilified and abused for doing so.”
 Imagine the hellish “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” updated for the internet. In the age of smartphones and viral videos, noted Sacks, millions of people can brew hate online — rarely speaking face-to-face with their disciples or their victims. This gap creates what researchers call a “disinhibition effect” that turns up the heat.
 “Cyberspace has proved to be the most effective incubator of resentment, rancor and conspiracy theories ever invented,” noted Sacks. Most people “encounter these phenomena … in the privacy of their own home. This allows them to be radicalized without anyone realizing it is happening. Time and again, we read of people carrying out horrific attacks, while those who knew them recall not having seen any warning signs that they were intent on committing evil attacks.”

The second factor is in Washington, also where anything can happen. The Senate trial now underway requires all sitting senators to do exactly that — sit. And by sitting in the Senate chamber, Klobuchar, Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont aren’t running in Iowa. They are hostages to the trial, leaving Biden and Buttigieg with all the air time and attention. The three senators at the top of the race are sidelined. So is Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is struggling for air in the presidential race and now is essentially out of breath.
 The Times editorial does in some way reshape the race, which once had a progressive lane (Sanders, Warren, perhaps others now departed), a moderate lane (Buttigieg, Klobuchar) and an outsider lane (Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang).
 With the pairing of Warren and Klobuchar, the race now has a female lane, pitting the two endorsed candidates against each other, and a blue-collar- appeal lane, pitting Sanders, who speaks of workers’ rights and excoriates the wealthy, against Biden, who also has appeal for working folks. Why else would a fight break out between the two men over Social Security, a vital retirement income supplement for working Americans?
 A study conducted by the Yale and George Mason centers on climate change communication separates Americans into categories depending on their views on climate change. For the first time, the segment “alarmed” about climate change has reached 31 percent, nearly triple its size five years ago, while those who were dismissive or doubtful of the effect of climate change have decreased.
 Does that mean anything politically? In the short run, it may be a boost to Steyer, who relentlessly has trumpeted the cause of climate change. Iowa is for upsets. That would be the biggest one of all time. It’s unlikely, almost out of the question. But a month ago, most of this column would have been considered just that way.

But commuters say they have been hearing about these for years, with nothing to show on the ground.

The audience knows Barry didn’t do it, so he immediately suspected it was his girlfriend Sharon, who was busy getting closer to her ex, which Barry has no idea about. Barry is also in trouble because he fired a bullet that unexpectedly killed an innocent man, and Richard has been working around the clock to cover his son’s tracks. Are you still with me because it’s a lot going on?

The most valuable skill to learn in college is prioritizing. Be sure to handle things of importance in the best order by creating daily to-do lists. This will help you in the long run and is a skill that will be needed in numerous aspects of life. Time management is another skill that works hand in hand with prioritizing, making them two imperative habits to build in college.

With that said, Lilly has no idea who to trust, not to mention, she has no idea about her husband’s past. Their relationship is already on the rocks, but what will she do when she learns about this bombshell of a secret. I want to discuss this week’s season finale that delivered a ton of nuggets for the audience. First, Barry’s mother Nancy (Ptosha Storey) has been worried sick that her son may have murdered his ex, wife a butcher knife that is missing from the kitchen. Well, the audience discovered the location of that knife which was hidden in a drawer in Barry’s bedroom, with a ton of money.

CORUNNA — During a convicted killer’s re-sentencing Friday, 35th Circuit Court Judge Matthew Stewart expressed sympathy for the victim’s family but said he was legally compelled to reduce the sentence from life without the possibility of parole to a term of years.
 Stewart said he had to abide by an agreement between the Kent County Prosecutor’s Office — which has handled Hammond’s re-sentencing because of a conflict within the Shiawassee County Prosecutor’s Office — and killer Ronald Hammond, 51.
 The agreement changed life without parole to 40 to 60 years in prison, with credit for 33 1/2 years served.

If reports from across Nigeria are also anything to go by, then, one can safely say that the man in the saddle as governor of Oyo State is a very likable person! No sooner had he mounted the saddle of governance than he started doing what truly portrayed him as not only being in charge but also as one helmsman who understands why he was elected to govern the over-6 million- strong population. And, within a few months in office, Seyi Makinde has demonstrated that strategic governance does not reside in building an empire or throwing money around but in building a team and being pragmatic in allocating resources to where they are needed most, in the most appropriate manner! He has proved that responsible leadership is not about the administration of an enclave. Rather, it is about the efficient management of the institution of the state; not even a public institution, because public institutions are located within the institution of the state.

Alt Twitter accounts, to quote Sherry Turkle, "stand betwixt and between, both in and not in real life … Their boundaries are more fuzzy; the routine of playing them become part of their players' real lives. The virtual reality becomes not so much an alternative as a parallel life."

Fred said, “Sure, take my bedroom; the whole house is already a zoo.”
 Several weeks passed. One day, he walked into the house and the cat rubbed against his leg. He reached down and when the cat saw his hand, instead of hissing, it arched its back to receive his caress. Same cat? Yes and no, and the difference was the touch of love.
 Fred said, “Not long ago, God reached out his hand to bless me and my family. When he did, I looked at his hand; it was covered with scratches.”
 Maybe, if you’ve been plagued with misfortune, you’ve been tempted to strike out at God. But I assure you, he’s reaching out in love.

In 2018, I started feeling nostalgic for the pseudonymous internet of my youth. I decided on a whim to create a "fake" Twitter account, a digital mask to temporarily shield my First Name Last Name from the strange spotlight of social media. What started as mindless entertainment slowly morphed into a therapeutic exercise in identity experimentation. I always thought that masks were for hiding, but I've learned that they often reveal as much as they obscure. They allow you to explore a new identity even as you retreat from an old one.
