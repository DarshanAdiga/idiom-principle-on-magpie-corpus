Every once in a while, you can have your beer poked at the Liederkranz.
 At last Saturday’s Sommerfest, Steve Stettner was the man in charge of tending the fire.
 Besides the beer, all you need is a red hot poker.
 “We stick it in the beer and give it a little bit of a twirl,” Stettner said. “It completely changes the flavor and the aroma profile of the beer.”
 Germans call the process bierstacheln, which means putting a hot spike into a beer.
 The poker has to be 1,571 degrees or hotter.
 “The alloy that those pokers are made out of won’t turn red until it’s 1,571 degrees,” Stettner said.
 Good things tend to happen around campfires. People say poked beers are the s’mores of beer drinking, Stettner said.
 Fans of beer spiking say the heat caramelizes the sugars, imparting a new taste.
 They say dark beers are best for beer poking.
 “Some beers are better after they’re poked,” Stettner said.
 If a beer has too much of a yeast flavor and is “more on the sour side,” beer poking will do a pretty good job of sweetening up the flavor, he said.
 As Stettner wielded his hot iron, he wore a T-shirt that read, “eins, zwei, drei, g’suffa.” In English, that means “one, two, three, guzzle.”
 Few places in Grand Island are as attractive as the courtyard of the Liederkranz. Not only is the area beautiful, but for some reason the temperature seems a little lower than in the rest of Grand Island.
 Last weekend, we had a good time sampling poked beer at the German-American club. We also enjoyed the food, which was prepared by Gloria Otradovsky and Verna Arnall.
 Stettner, 41, is in charge of the Liederkranz’s Bier Klub. He is assisted by Fred Otradovsky.

This series, which includes about 150 watercolor prints so far, has sold well enough that it’s allowed Koehn (who sold his events business in 2015) to finally focus on his art full-time at age 59.

Let’s face it, the pandemic has taken such a toll on every one of us in many different ways. Let’s also be honest about the changing guidance and the myriad of problems we have that appear to be without workable solutions just five weeks before the start of school.
 Public school principals and superintendents have worked tirelessly all summer, foregoing vacation and family time, sweating over each and every detail about how to reopen schools safely. I don’t bring this up for sympathy but to emphasize that even so, we are where we are. Why is that?
 As you can see, reopening plans for Vermont school districts started to be published in the past 10 days and they are all over the map, vastly different from each other. Why? Because basically we received only Health and Safety guidance. Under the guise of local control and the need to respond flexibly to the differences in each district, leaders were told by state officials to basically go figure it out. This is a repeat of Act 46 and Proficiency Based Learning except with even more at stake. Yes., many superintendents and principals truly cannot sleep at night.
 It is no surprise that, as we all surveyed parents and staff throughout the summer and read and reread the results and statewide guidance, this is where we ended up. So, we are told to reopen the schools. That said, in most places, I think we are going to try to reopen school, and I think we will fail in ways that may have permanent, unrecoverable repercussions for our students, school systems and community. And why am I making such a strong, worrisome statement? That is because this is a very significant statewide problem and it requires a significant statewide solution. The big elephant in the room is operational, having nothing much to do with the “how to’s” of safely bringing students and staff into the building based on transmission of the virus and epidemiological science. It comes down to workforce and child care issues that cannot be solved at the local level.
 Let’s shift gears for a moment. If you were a superintendent after spending the entire summer trying to develop a reopening model with your team, and you received a one-question survey on July 22 needing immediate response that asked, “Would you support an executive order mandating that schools not begin any instructional operations (in-person, remote or hybrid) earlier than 9/8?” would you be concerned? How about confused? Angry maybe?
 Well, leaders and educators throughout the state received this very survey question at the 11th hour last Tuesday, for me, two days before publishing our model, and for some of my colleagues after theirs had already gone out. Many superintendents throughout the state already started to delay the start of school by one week until Aug. 31 by changing regional calendars. Why? Because we have many, many, unanswered questions.
 So, why would our governor be contemplating such an Executive Order? Could it be due to health, operational or political concerns, or all three? He has done an outstanding job with COVID-19 and I trust his judgement. Therefore, I conclude something big is afoot to be considering this action. Maybe we will never know why or what and it may not come to fruition, but that doesn’t change the fact that superintendents are left to deal with it without explanation.
 Oh, yes, let’s not forget the big elephant in the room — having a workforce to operate. So, while I cannot provide the survey response data, I can say that out of 49 superintendents responding, only six said no. Why? Because I am pretty certain there is not a superintendent in this state who knows with certainty they can staff their school.
 Then on July 23, again at the 11th hour, the AOE published a document that states, “school boards with (typo: they mean, will) have the authority to decide which of these instructional dispositions (remote, hybrid, or in- person) will be implemented in their schools.” Really? Why are we all being told this now? Secretary French was asked and replied that school boards could establish policy (which takes about 45 days by standard statutory process) or delegate authority to the superintendent to do so through administrative procedure. I think I am starting to see a picture in these connect-the-dots. So, presumably the Scott administration is contemplating the Executive Order about schools not reopening at all until Sept. 8, seemingly to indicate we need more time for some unknown reason, and school boards who hold labor contracts with their employees are left to solve the problem of the big elephant in the room.
 Yesterday, I participated in meetings throughout the state, speaking with many superintendents already considering drastically changing the reopening plans they have just published. Some who published opening plans for five days a week are now considering a totally remote model and still others are moving closer to a more remote model. Why? Because superintendents do not think they can staff their schools.
 Letters of resignation, requests for leaves of absence, Family Medical Leave (FMLA), Emergency Family Medical Leave (EFML), Emergency Paid Sick Leave (EPSL), Exemption status, and leave under the Families First Coronavirus Relief Act (FFCRA) (which provides up to 12 weeks of leave for employees unable to work because their child’s school is closed) are coming in.

WASHINGTON — Perhaps the most poignant moment in this week’s commemoration of Rep. John Lewis’ life was seeing him cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge one last time in a horse-drawn caisson, while a line of Alabama state troopers stood at the other end of the bridge — this time to honor him rather than beat him. It was a testament to just how far this country had come since Bloody Sunday in 1965.
 Lewis was the last of the “Big Six” leaders who organized the March on Washington. So with his passing, it is a good time to ask what lessons we can draw from their example that can inform today’s movement for racial justice — especially at a moment when some have embraced an iconoclasm that seeks to cancel and discredit the founding of this country.
 In his “I Have a Dream” speech, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. appealed to the ideals of the American founding. He declared, “When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.” Our founders made a “promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ‘unalienable Rights’ of ‘Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.’ ” He had come to Washington, he said, “to cash ... a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice” so that “one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.’ ”
 Lewis, the youngest speaker at the March on Washington, echoed King’s sentiments in his address that day. “I appeal to all of you to get into this great revolution that is sweeping this nation,” he said. “Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete. We must ... complete the revolution.”
 They saw the fight for civil rights not as a rejection of the American founding but as the necessary next step for its fulfillment and completion. They did not simply argue that racism was unfair; they argued that racism was un-American.
 That is a message King kept preaching until his last moments on earth. In a speech the night before he was killed, King appealed to our founding principles, and argued that it was Bull Conner who was violating them. “If I lived in China or even Russia, or any totalitarian country, maybe I could understand some of these illegal injunctions,” King said. “Maybe I could understand the denial of certain basic First Amendment privileges, because they hadn’t committed themselves to that over there. But somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly. Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech. Somewhere I read of the freedom of press. Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for right.” King said the goal of the civil rights movement was to “to make America what it ought to be” by “standing up for the best in the American Dream and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy, which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.” The next day, he was felled by an assassin’s bullet.
 King never made it to the promised land. But Lewis did. On the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, Lewis stood at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and citing President Lyndon B. Johnson, compared the March on Selma to the battles of Lexington and Concord. “In the final analysis,” he said, “we are one people. ... We all live in the same House, the American House, the world House.”
 We can’t advance racial justice by tearing that house down.

1951-2020 -- It is with a heavy heart that we announce the unexpected passing of our good friend Stephen Gadomski at his home in Vero Beach, Florida on Friday, July 24, 2020. Stephen "Steve" Gadomski was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts on January 11, 1951 to the late Chester J. Gadomski and Jean (Trowbridge) Gadomski. Steve graduated from New Bedford High School in 1969. He belonged to St. Hedwig's Catholic Church where he served as an altar boy. He was extremely active in the Boy Scouts of America first as a scout where he became an Eagle Scout and obtained the "Order of the Arrow- Vigil Honor". While in High School and later in College, he served as a Camp Counselor during the summer and attended several National Jamborees and twice led Boy Scout groups to Philmont in New Mexico. Later, he held positions of leadership at the District, Regional and National Levels in the BSA. For his dedicated volunteer work, he was awarded the Boy Scouts Silver Beaver and Silver Buffalo medals. Steve attended Boston College where he received his Bachelor of Science Degree and later went on to graduate work where he earned a Master's Degree in Education. While attending Boston College he began working part time for the College in the Housing Department. Upon graduation he continued working for Boston College in the Campus Police department. Steve moved to Middletown, Connecticut where he began working as the Assistant Director of Public Safety at Wesleyan University. After a number of years at Wesleyan he opted to go into private business and worked with partners in creating TCC, a specialized radio and maintenance service business in Middletown. In 1994, Steve joined Ocean Surveys, Inc of Old Saybrook, Connecticut, a firm specializing in acquiring and interpreting scientific data from both marine and freshwater environments where he worked for the next 20 years as an Oceanographic Technician before retiring in 2014. Steve Gadomski was very active in local politics in Middletown. He became a member of the Republican Party and worked actively supporting a number of Republican candidates for State and local office. He became a member of the Republican Town Committee and ran, unsuccessfully for the City Council in the 1981 municipal campaign. Later he received the GOP nomination to run for Sheriff of Middlesex County against long-time Democrat Party incumbent Joseph "Knobby" Walsh. He was not able to defeat Walsh but remained upbeat and positive and continued his political involvement. He was elected to the Planning &amp; Zoning Commission of the City of Middletown where he served with distinction for over 25 years. Steve was also active in a number of social clubs, most particularly the Polish National Home. In 1980, Steve met and fell in love with the love of his life, Joan Nichols. The two started off as friends and became life partners in every sense of the word. They shared a lovely home on Durant Street in Middletown for many years before moving to Coleman Road. In November 2015, Steve and Joan decided to make the move to their retirement home in Vero Beach, Florida. As usual Steve's natural talent for involvement kicked-in and it was not long before he became the Secretary of the Board of Directors for the community of Woodfield. Steve found his niche at Woodfield where he was able to play golf on a regular basis with many of his new friends. Steve Gadomski was a hard-working, fun-loving person. Very bright and well read, he could hold his own in discussions on a myriad number of topics-- most especially politics and current events. A generous and kind friend, he was always available to lend a hand whenever and wherever needed. He is survived by Joan Nichols, his loving life-partner of more than 40 years, his brother Jim Gadomski and his wife Susan of Dartmouth, Massachusetts his brother Fred Gadomski of State College Pennsylvania; and his three nieces; Wendy (Jonathan) Duval of Dartmouth, Massachusetts; Erica (Aaron) Karpas of Lincoln University, Pennsylvania and Lori (Jason) Griffiths of Chelsea, Maine as well as eight grand nieces and nephews as well as dozens of long-time friends who will remember him with love and affection.

PHOENIX (AP) — Christian Walker hit a three-run double in the eighth inning and the Arizona Diamondbacks broke out of their offensive funk to rally past the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3 Friday night. The Diamondbacks labored through the first seven innings, managing one run on five hits. Trailing 3-2 in the eighth, Arizona loaded the bases against Blake Treinen (0-1) and Walker lined a double just past the outreached glove of center fielder Mookie Betts. David Peralta followed with a run-scoring single to make it 5-3. Hector Rondon (1-0) got one out in the eighth for his first win with Arizona. Archie Bradley walked a batter and gave up a double to Betts in the ninth before getting Cody Bellinger to pop out for his second save in three chances. Betts hit his first homer with the Dodgers, had three hits, drove in two runs and made a sensational, long throw for an out at third. Corey Seager homered for the third straight game. Betts signed one of the richest contracts in baseball history, agreeing to a $365 million, 12-year deal on the eve of opening day. The 27-year-old got off to a slow start in his first season in Los Angeles, entering Friday's game hitting .206 with a pair of doubles. Betts had an immediate impact Friday night, throwing from deep in the right field corner to third base on the fly to get Ketel Marte, who was trying to stretch a double in the first inning. Betts hit his first homer with the Dodgers in the fourth inning, a towering solo shot just inside the foul pole in left. He added a run-scoring single to put the Dodgers up 2-0 in the fifth. Kole Calhoun hit a run-scoring double in the fifth inning to pull the Diamondbacks within 2-1, but Gonzalez worked out of a jam to limit the damage. Seager hit a long solo homer in the eighth inning off Kevin...

First and foremost, Thank you. Thank you to each and every individual who has prayed for me, thought of me, sent me their love and has showered me with their support. In this present moment, it is my only responsibility to be real with myself and to be real with the ones who truly love me and care for my healing. I have without fail, shared with you my brightest days, and I know that sharing with you what has been my darkest will be the light for any man or woman who is feeling the same defeat I felt just only a week ago. Every one of us has a desire, whether small or big, to make it out of where we come from to an ideal future place that includes, freedom to be who we choose, security for our children and families, and fortune to share with the ones we love. We believe these things can co-exist with just being happy. I believed that, that as a black woman, as an artist, an influence, a personality I could shape my world, and with whom I believed to be my partners, they could help me share my world. Over the past 11 years there were promises made to protect and portray my story, with the authenticity and honesty I gave. I was betrayed, taken advantage of, overworked, and underpaid. I wrote a letter over 2 months ago asking to be freed from what I believed was excessive and unfair. I explained in personal detail the demise I was experiencing. My cry for help went totally ignored. However the demands persisted. It was my spirit, and my soul that was tainted the most. There are a few things I count on most to be, a good mother, a good daughter, a good partner, a good sister, and a good person. Who I was, begun to mean little to nothing, because it would only be how I was portrayed on television that would matter. It was witnessing the slow death of the woman I became, that discouraged my will to fight. I felt like I was no longer living, I was existing for the purpose of a corporations gain and ratings, and that killed me. Mental illness is real. We have to normalize acknowledging it and stop associating it with shame and humiliation. The pain that I have experienced over the past 11 years has slowly ate away at my spirit and my mental.

It's very easy to look at the lives of actors and think that they have it good, perhaps too good despite how skilled and dedicated some of them are to their craft. A lot of times it's easy enough to step back and realize that being envious isn't the best lifestyle choice, but there are those moments when thinking that actors are allowed to get away with too much becomes a valid train of thought. This usually happens when actors are allowed to skirt the law on occasion due to their fame and because they have the money that allows them to purchase the best legal representation that they can afford. Some might cry foul at this but the legality of being able to afford your own defense team is unquestionable, while the fact that some of those in Hollywood have never had the moral fiber to stand up and say 'Yes, I did it' is highly questionable. There are fans that will defend their favorite actors to the end, much as the lawyers will, so long as payments are made, but now and again it feels worth it to point out that fame and fortune have managed to save several actors and high-profile celebrities that otherwise should have been spending a good amount of time behind bars, as this would be the punishment levied against someone that's not famous or rich enough to hire a private attorney to champion their less than noble cause.

But I am frustrated to continuously hear from elected officials that we need to “shut down all bars if we are going to re-open schools and our economy”. No, that is not what we need to do. Governor Cuomo has smartly seen a distinction in NYC, between sit-down restaurants that serve food and encourage social distancing and standing bars that seem to disregard public safety. But I’m supportive and behind bars that are cognizant of the challenges of keeping their staff and patrons safe and who are desperately trying to stay alive. There is a balance that can be achieved between professionally operated spaces and fools who don’t serve right (pardon the pun, I didn’t mean, we don’t serve the right, which seem to follow Trump’s disregard for mask wearing and all that symbolizes). The SLA seems to be able to enforce 21+, no smoking rules, etc.. which our society needs and the power of sanction, especially the lifeblood of holding an on-premise liquor license, certainly must be used to enforce the law. As Cuomo said, there should be “no tolerance for illegal and reckless endangerment of public health”.

Jackson Rehkow has a pretty good idea his name will be penciled into the starting lineup this summer for the Kansas City Knights, who play in the Ban Johnson League. The only thing he doesn't know is where he will be playing that day.
   
 The Blue Springs South graduate has turned into a super utility player since leaving high school and he thanks his junior college coach for the foresight - even if he didn't see it at the time.
   
 Rehkow was predominately a catcher for the Jaguars and his summer team, KC Elite, but things changed when he landed at Highland (Kan.) Community College.
   
 The Scotties had a strong catcher behind the plate, so coach Brandon Dulin suggested Rehkow try playing some infield.
   
 "It was a big change," Rehkow said. "I didn't like it but I was young and didn't really know what was happening … but it really prepared me for where I am at now."
   
 Rehkow parlayed his new versatility into a spot at Division I Arkansas-Pine Bluff this past year. He got some time behind the plate as a catcher for the Golden Lions, but also played first base, second base and third base.
   
 "I love it now," Rehkow said of the many positions he plays. "At the end of the day I'm just playing baseball. It doesn't matter to me if I'm at second, third, first. Just have the same mindset and make some small adjustments. I look back on it and most programs I have seen, a catcher only gets about 35 games at most in a 56-game season versus a position player; I can play 50-plus games. I didn't realize it at the time. This year, if I would've just caught only eight to 10 games before the season ended. Instead, I'm a guy they can put in anywhere."
   
 When Rehkow shows up to the ballpark each night, he's ready to play any position. He carries a first baseman mitt, two catcher's mitts, a middle infield glove, a third base glove and an outfield glove - a position he played one series during his sophomore year of college.
   
 So far for the Knights, he has caught, played second base, shortstop, first base and third base.
   
 Dulin knew Rehkow could handle all the positions even before the player did.
   
 "I heard good things about him and I saw the summer team play a lot and coach Rod Myers and I had a conversation about him," said Dulin, who is in his fifth year at Highland. "The biggest thing we saw was he had a good arm. I think the biggest thing we learned was he was a good baseball player, with a good baseball IQ, and he had good pedigree with his grandpa. He knows how the game is supposed to be played and what it looks like."
   
 The grandfather referenced by Dulin is Freddie Patek, a shortstop who is in the Royals Hall of Fame. Rehkow didn't bring up the connection and Dulin understands Rehkow is trying to make a name for himself.
   
 Becoming a Division I player will do that for someone. He did that by his transition to new positions at Highland.
   
 "Some guys fight and throw a fit and put up a fight," Dulin said. "I know he didn't like it but he also understood and did what we needed to do. Credit to him for handling it the right way. I think we joked he wasn't the prettiest, but hey, he can go make plays and he will figure it out. Jackson just wanted to play and help his team however he could. I knew he wanted to catch and we had a lot of conversations. I felt for the group - and ultimately for him moving forward - it would help him become more of a well-rounded baseball player and he took to it."
   
 Rehkow made the travel team as a freshman and moved into the starting lineup in the middle of the season after the Scotties lost a starting first baseman and third baseman in the same week.
   
 "I'm glad we had him on the bus ride that day," Dulin said. "We had to play him and from there, he took off and ran with it."
   
 He got a full scholarship offer from UAPB and took it over offers from Division II schools or a walk-on opportunity at Division I Grand Canyon.
   
 Being at UAPB has provided an opportunity to play bigger name schools - or would've had the season not been canceled earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This year, the Golden Lions played Baylor, Wichita State and Oklahoma. Games at Ole Miss, Missouri and Arkansas were called off.
   
 "You have a bunch of big schools that scouts watch, and if you have a good game, you will get looked at too," said Rehkow, a psychology major. "I'd love to continue to play after college, but coaching would be great too. It is a great game and it is hard to give it up no matter what."
   
 He will still have two full years of eligibility at UAPB due to the NCAA waiver for spring sports athletes. He is getting back much-needed at-bats he missed during the spring season playing for the Knights this summer.
   
 Rehkow has played for the Knights the past two years, but this year is the first in the Ban Johnson League. The Knights are a member of the Mid-Plains League, but that league decided not to play due to the pandemic. Then the Knights looked to have a chance to play in the MINK League, but that league also shuttered before playing a game. The Ban Johnson League stayed open and Rehkow took some time to adjust to his baseball swing after playing a lot of golf in the downtime without baseball.
   
 "To me, baseball is baseball no matter where you play," he said. "I respect every level of baseball and that is another thing about Ban Johnson. There are a lot of guys I have known my whole life from high school to junior college. You watch them become good players no matter what level they are. Going D-I was the goal. That is part of the reason I didn't go D-II out of high school because I felt I had it in me to go D-I. I just had to reach my full potential. In high school I didn't realize I'd be a guy that would play six or seven positions. Once I found out what type of player I was, I realized someone could use that."

Rising COIVD-19 case counts across the U.S. have made a second lockdown seem almost inevitable. It is likely to be months before a vaccine could end the coronavirus pandemic, and the U.S. is also months away from using the testing- and-tracing strategy other countries have used to keep new outbreaks from expanding.
 But Americans can’t be expected to stay in their homes for months on end. The rational, fair, humane way forward is for society to balance pandemic safety against other vital needs — the need to make a living, the need for education and the need for social interaction.
 People who want to break out of solitary confinement are not necessarily ignoring “the science.” They are balancing what scientists have found with other factors, just as people who use air conditioning in 100-degree weather aren’t necessarily global warming deniers. You can take global warming seriously without making every possible sacrifice.
 To combat the coronavirus crisis, public health officials have urged extreme measures — doing everything we can to prevent further spread of the pandemic. What they should be telling us is how to reduce our odds of getting the disease in a way that can be sustained economically and socially, while keeping the curve flattened and hospital beds available.
 Risk communication consultant Peter Sandman says he thinks our current “do everything you can to avoid infection” policy in public health is driven by the urge to make up for past mistakes on the part of politicians and experts in public health. In January and February, they reassured people the risk was low even as the disease spread quickly in China and there was every reason to think it would go elsewhere.
 Then the public health community panicked, he says. He’s worked on a number of pandemic preparedness plans and read others, and none of them mentioned telling everyone to stay home for the foreseeable future.
 There was a good rationale to ask New Yorkers to stay home earlier this year. Flattening the curve in New York City meant preventing too many people from getting seriously ill at once and overwhelming hospitals. But the reason for the lockdowns that look place in most other states was never clearly communicated.
 Business closures and stay-at-home orders would have been justifiable in less- hard-hit states, if they were used to buy time to better cope with outbreaks — ramping up testing and contact tracing and preparing hospitals with supplies and protective equipment. That failed spectacularly, especially in Florida, Arizona, Texas and California.
 People there made enormous sacrifices and got very little in return, since almost nothing was done to make the situation any safer coming out of the shutdowns than going into them. Now, Sandman says, people are drained of their economic and emotional reserves.
 Public health officials — and society more broadly — have to come to terms with the fact that we’re not in this together. It’s easy for some people to stay home. Some people are living comfortably on savings or do-at-home jobs, surrounded by family. Some are more motivated to stay home, since they have health conditions that put them at a much higher risk of dying if they contract COVID-19.
 Others need to leave the house to work. Especially for younger, healthier people who are at very low risk of dying or developing long-term complications, it might be reasonable to accept some risk in exchange for the chance to make a living, see beloved friends, find a life partner or give their kids the educations they need to succeed. These are not trivial things.
 Now it’s time to make the best of a bad situation and finally start creating well-communicated long-term policies that allow some degree of balance. Harvard epidemiologist William Hanage said he doesn’t like the use of the word “reopening.” Better, he says, to think about keeping infections at a manageable level by limiting activities that are known to be high-risk.
 And risks of different activities vary by place and time, so mayors, governors and other local leaders need to keep people as informed as possible about local conditions. What matters is the approximate number of active, infectious cases in a region — not the cumulative cases, since many have recovered, or the rate of change, when the base number of cases might be very low.
 Current transmission rates can be estimated by various techniques including testing a random sample of people or measuring the level of virus in local sewage. This is critical to know because the hazard of opening gyms or bars will be much higher in an area of current outbreak than one with almost no cases.
 It’s also time to stop blaming one another — which is tearing us apart. As Sandman pointed out, “all public health failures are policy failures.” If people don’t follow a policy, it’s because it’s the wrong policy or was badly communicated. This is what policymakers are supposed to think through.
 A few brave souls in the public health community, trying to help people find a level of much-needed balance, have come forward to say that some activities are relatively low risk. Being around other people outdoors is safer than indoors, and short exposures are safer than long ones. If everyone wears a mask, getting a haircut is OK. Getting exercise outdoors is reasonable. Outdoor restaurant tables are safer than indoor ones.
 That way, people can be armed with enough information to be good citizens during the pandemic, while still leading lives worth living.

Lakes Region starting pitcher Aubrey Ramey came out, having given up no hits through 5 2/3 innings, in order to preserve his arm for possible weekend outings.
 “Aubrey pitched well. He threw a lot of pitches, so we had to take him out,” said Lakes Region coach Adam Greenlese.
 South Burlington’s bats finally got to Lakes pitching, getting its first hit of the game off Andrew Lanthier. After that hit, Mason Klesch singled and that put the away side on the board. Lanthier worked out of it to keep the damage low.
 Lakes had a chance to answer back in the the bottom of the sixth, but couldn’t push any runs across.
 The inning was filled with close calls and both sides had some gripes.
 Dylan Lee came up to lead off the sixth and hit a grounder to second base. The second baseman threw the ball away and Lee tried to go for the extra base. The throw came in and it was close. Lee was called safe and the South Burlington coach let his displeasure be known.
 With a runner on second and nobody out, the inning continued. Another close play involving Lee resulted in an out at home. The Lakes Region coaching staff didn’t like the call. Later in the inning, there was another close play at the plate and the runner was called out again.
 Close calls happen, and whether teams like them or not, they have to keep playing.

Tell-tale signs of their presence are stems stripped of leaves, gouged fruit and grenade-like black droppings known as frass. Look straight up from the droppings to find the culprit. Be vigilant and do this several times a week, if not daily.
 Fortunately, following integrated pest management (IPM) practices such as handpicking in early morning and evening has proven to be an effective solution. These fleshy hornworms have strong legs, so you’ll need a firm grip. Pick them off — this may take a little grit — and drop them in a jar of soapy water.
 Another IPM strategy is to encourage predatory insects to visit your garden. The herbs, nectar-producing plants and flowers blooming in your garden will prove valuable for this purpose. Lacewings and ladybugs will prey on eggs and young hornworms. Paper wasps mostly feed on caterpillars, including hornworms.
 In addition, the braconid wasp (Cotesia congregata), which lays eggs on the body of hornworms, is a welcome ally. The wasp’s larvae feed on the hornworm making it look like a sushi roll. If left alone, the wasps will emerge, kill the worm then seek out their next victim.
 Finally, keeping your garden tidy and weed-free will discourage the adult moth by reducing potential sites for it to lay its eggs. At the end of the season after harvest, till the soil to get rid of burrowing hornworms and pupae. And, as always, get in the habit of rotating your crops.

So, we need to quickly establish laws that stop super spreader events like the Chainsmokers event in the Hamptons that took advantage of the “drive-in” concept of a concert. But don’t stop all musical events because some people disregard the rules. We need safe outdoor concerts today that people can enjoy safely. Musicians need the ecosystem of live music desperately which for some is their only source of revenue. We need to urgently find ways to create safe environments for limited capacity, safe, and professional places people can sit, eat, drink and listen to music. The blanket restriction of NO LIVE MUSIC has given rise to a growing, unsupervised, at-home backyard concert culture, which is counterproductive to our critical public health and economic goals. Let us professional, responsible, holders of liquor licenses take on the challenging business of live music which we have built our careers doing. We need to be smart about the re-opening of our world, but it does need to re- open before our industry and all of live entertainment is dead. Put people who disregard the rules behind bars, but don’t kill all bars!

1951-2020 -- It is with a heavy heart that we announce the unexpected passing of our good friend Stephen Gadomski at his home in Vero Beach, Florida on Friday, July 24, 2020. Stephen "Steve" Gadomski was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts on January 11, 1951 to the late Chester J. Gadomski and Jean (Trowbridge) Gadomski. Steve graduated from New Bedford High School in 1969. He belonged to St. Hedwig's Catholic Church where he served as an altar boy. He was extremely active in the Boy Scouts of America first as a scout where he became an Eagle Scout and obtained the "Order of the Arrow-Vigil Honor". While in High School and later in College, he served as a Camp Counselor during the summer and attended several National Jamborees and twice led Boy Scout groups to Philmont in New Mexico. Later, he held positions of leadership at the District, Regional and National Levels in the BSA. For his dedicated volunteer work, he was awarded the Boy Scouts Silver Beaver and Silver Buffalo medals. Steve attended Boston College where he received his Bachelor of Science Degree and later went on to graduate work where he earned a Master's Degree in Education. While attending Boston College he began working part time for the College in the Housing Department. Upon graduation he continued working for Boston College in the Campus Police department. Steve moved to Middletown, Connecticut where he began working as the Assistant Director of Public Safety at Wesleyan University. After a number of years at Wesleyan he opted to go into private business and worked with partners in creating TCC, a specialized radio and maintenance service business in Middletown. In 1994, Steve joined Ocean Surveys, Inc of Old Saybrook, Connecticut, a firm specializing in acquiring and interpreting scientific data from both marine and freshwater environments where he worked for the next 20 years as an Oceanographic Technician before retiring in 2014. Steve Gadomski was very active in local politics in Middletown. He became a member of the Republican Party and worked actively supporting a number of Republican candidates for State and local office. He became a member of the Republican Town Committee and ran, unsuccessfully for the City Council in the 1981 municipal campaign. Later he received the GOP nomination to run for Sheriff of Middlesex County against long-time Democrat Party incumbent Joseph "Knobby" Walsh. He was not able to defeat Walsh but remained upbeat and positive and continued his political involvement. He was elected to the Planning & Zoning Commission of the City of Middletown where he served with distinction for over 25 years. Steve was also active in a number of social clubs, most particularly the Polish National Home. In 1980, Steve met and fell in love with the love of his life, Joan Nichols. The two started off as friends and became life partners in every sense of the word. They shared a lovely home on Durant Street in Middletown for many years before moving to Coleman Road. In November 2015, Steve and Joan decided to make the move to their retirement home in Vero Beach, Florida. As usual Steve's natural talent for involvement kicked-in and it was not long before he became the Secretary of the Board of Directors for the community of Woodfield. Steve found his niche at Woodfield where he was able to play golf on a regular basis with many of his new friends. Steve Gadomski was a hard- working, fun-loving person. Very bright and well read, he could hold his own in discussions on a myriad number of topics--most especially politics and current events. A generous and kind friend, he was always available to lend a hand whenever and wherever needed. He is survived by Joan Nichols, his loving life-partner of more than 40 years, his brother Jim Gadomski and his wife Susan of Dartmouth, Massachusetts his brother Fred Gadomski of State College Pennsylvania; and his three nieces; Wendy (Jonathan) Duval of Dartmouth, Massachusetts; Erica (Aaron) Karpas of Lincoln University, Pennsylvania and Lori (Jason) Griffiths of Chelsea, Maine as well as eight grand nieces and nephews as well as dozens of long-time friends who will remember him with love and affection.

The last sunset for Richard Charles Carroll was July 28, 2020, for our beloved peacefully left this world to enter the next while at the Denali Center in Fairbanks, Alaska, to be with his wife, Eva Carroll.   We, family and friends, are left to mourn, yet we believe our parents are now united in the next life, feeling appreciative for the time we had together.   Richard Carroll was born in Fort Yukon, Alaska, on Oct. 14, 1930, son of the late James A. and Fannie Martin Carroll. Richard is preceded by his parents and siblings Clifton Carroll Sr. (Alice), Mabel Carroll, James Ward Sr., Joe Carroll (Margaret), Harry Carroll, Tommy Carroll (Nellie), Albert Carroll (Alice), Anne Moran (Terrance), and Calvin Carroll. Richard is survived by his sisters Fannie Booth and Delores Sloan. Richard also was preceded in death by his wife, Eva Carroll; daughters Kathleen Meiser, Sylvia Karen Carlo and Christine Rifredi; and sadly by grandchildren Martin Chance Carroll and Branden Hughes; and great-grandchildren Zen Carroll and Onis Kivi.   Richard is survived by daughters Beverly Beardsley (Mark), F. Mabel Michael, Juanita Diane Bridges (David), Frannie Hughes Cobb (Jeff) and Velma Carroll; sons Richard Charles Carroll II (Kathleen), James Paul Carroll (Jennifer), Anthony Carroll and William Wade Carroll; grandchildren Gregory Stover Jr. (Missy), Tamara Morris, Damon Smith, Shawn (Jessica) Fears, Lewis Richard Firmin, Andrew Firmin, Jolene (Brandon) Telford, Gabrielle and Jamie (Marlin), Kimberly Carlo, Leon Carroll, Christina Rifredi, RC Rifredi, Nicolya (Jim) Hargrove, Gavin (Jenn) Rifredi, Eda Carroll, Richard Carroll III, Samuel Shane Hughes, Jason Kivi, Travis Carroll, Jeanetta Carroll, Lynneva Carroll, Shaylene (Gary) Simple, Kayleen Carroll, Karissa Carroll, Brittany Carroll, Mary Paige Carroll, Todd Solomon, Chaz Carroll and Mitchell Carroll. The many blessings of great-grandchildren Tessa Wallis, Nations Jordan, Thea Carlo, Emily Morris, Lily Grace Fears, Samuel Ethan Hughes, Tori Hughes, Aiden Smith, Carter Smith, Grayson and Chandler Solomon, Bliss Simple, Walker and Matt Jr., Roy, Evonna and Carson, Haisley Belle, Martin Bo and George Lucas, Angelica and Karrilee Firmin, Josiah and Avril Firmin, Brooklyn and Sawyer, Jesse, Aviana and Cain Vent, Bryson and Mckinney, Emma and Koda Bear, Tayler and Tyson, Seraphina Carroll, Liam and Elaina Telford, Kiley, Kennedy, Mason, Kaydence, Alyx, Isaia, Asher and Hunter.   As a young man, Richard held family and honor and giving to our community and our people in the highest regard. Eager to do his part, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and worked at Ladd Field in the weather station. This may very well be where he grew to love flying airplanes. He said he would have our mother watch as he practiced "shooting landings" with a small plane. In 1963, he received a Certificate of Appreciation from President John F. Kennedy for serving on the Selective Service Board.   Richard married Eva Kelly, and together they decided to take up the family tradition of trapping. As their family grew, Richard was quick to learn how to operate enterprises as his father had run, like Cash Grocery on Front Street in Fort Yukon. As he told us, he operated a bakery shop when new construction of the military site came to Fort Yukon. When he saw heavy equipment being brought into Fort Yukon, he was so interested that he talked his way into the driver's seat and learned construction. Today, we have many buildings built under his direction as he took leadership roles to make a better life for us in the Yukon Flats. With seasonal changes, he always managed to get us our subsistence foods.   Richard raised his family by teaching by example - having us work in his many ventures, from operating the Show House to selling ice cream from his Boat Street Grocery.   In searching for ways to support family, Richard was the first Alaska Native appointed as a U.S. Commissioner and Justice of the Peace in rural Alaska. It is as if some of us can still hear him rapidly tapping on his typewriter with two fingers! Documents prove he assisted in creating our local government as he was the past president of the Fort Yukon Village Council. He became the local station manger for Wien Air. This job had relocated his family twice, then in 1971, the family settled back home in Fort Yukon.   With the love of home, Richard worked to make life in Fort Yukon a better one as we needed infrastructure and locally controlled schools. He worked and trained many staffers to operate systems that helped Fort Yukon become a second-class city, with roads and a safer water system. A side note: Richard had very scribble type handwriting, as many of his staffers had to first read his handwriting in order to function in his office as city manager.   With all of his family members, Richard was part of the start of our Gwitchyaa Zhee Village Corporation as one of the original signers on our Articles. The transactions for the purchase of our existing power company bears his signatures. With dreams for our future, he also served on the Doyon board of directors.   All the while, Richard's heart is sincerely connected to the Porcupine River, for it is here he most enjoyed the everyday hard work, the quiet evenings and the still mornings. He eventually retired to operate his lodge, the Porcupine River Lodge, which was his dream. He so enjoyed trapping, as that is where he and his bride started their journey together in their first years of marriage. The circle of life allowed them many years on the trapline. The stories he enjoyed telling are with us, and we will look forward to sharing some with you, his family and friends, when this COVID pandemic shall allow for a celebration of life and memorial services. For now, he leaves us with many wonderful stories as he was generous to share with many family and friends who visited him with laughter and a good cup of tea.   We shall have a private family burial in Fort Yukon, next to his beloved, Eva, at 3 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 1, 2020, at Hudson Stuck Cemetery at our Ole Village Site, after his final boat trip up the Porcupine River.

The Jays were supposed to be in Philadelphia this weekend. The series opener was pushed back from Friday to Saturday before all three games were cancelled. So the Jays remained in Washington looking for ways to stay busy until facing the Atlanta Braves on Tuesday. That's the 2020 season in a nutshell.

Arguably. one of the safest, perhaps even the safest, place in the country, Vermont faces as much confusion and indecision regarding school reopening as anywhere else, further exacerbated by simply not knowing for sure how many students will attend but — even more importantly — how many staff members will call out, take medical leave or even retire. This single issue creates a near insurmountable dilemma with staff members delaying their decisions until they see what configuration their school will roll out while administrators’ vision is completely dependent on what staffing pattern they can rely on.
 In an open letter to the community last week, Brigid Nease, superintendent of the Harwood Unified School District, poignantly articulated the desperation facing educational leaders across Vermont: “Public school principals and superintendents have worked tirelessly all summer, foregoing vacation and family time, sweating over each and every detail about how to reopen schools safely.” She goes on to voice the collective frustration of finding reopening plans of various districts “all over the map, vastly different from each other.” as well as “The big elephant in the room — having a workforce to operate.”
 Nease’s concerns are reflected in the national confusion aggravated by conflicting recommendations from the White House, pushing schools to reopen completely while hundreds of medical professionals urge states to once again close down in the face of mounting infection rates and hospitalizations. More ominously, reports indicate children and teens can become infected and spread the virus at much higher rates than previously believed.
 As responsible officials grimly go about bringing clarity to what America is facing, the ostensible leader of the free world relentlessly touts debunked medical interventions and outrageous conspiracy theories, earlier this week retweeting claims by a doctor who believes disease may result from alien DNA and “demon sperm.” When several obvious questions arose at the newly reincarnated daily COVID-19 briefings on Tuesday, Individual #1, after pouting “nobody likes me,” turned on his heels and left the podium, unwittingly illustrating precisely how our country has gone from being a world leader and beacon of hope to an object of international pity.
 Where we go from here is anyone’s guess, and unfortunately, it’s almost Sunday night.

No dice el Ayuntamiento que han tenido que pasar mas de tres años para que se incorporen estos primeros nueve policias, y que seran cuatro los años de espera para que llegue la promocion completa. Los nueve primeros agentes son los procedentes del turno de movilidad, es decir, personas que ya ejercian como policias en otros municipios y ahora ingresan en Sevilla capital.

Before heading to a small picnic with friends (social distancing-style, of course), I decided to put on Hourglass' mascara, Milk Makeup's concealer over my acne scars, and some Anastasia Brow Wiz for what would be the first time in months. I had expected my makeup to be completely gone after embarrassingly sweating nonstop while sitting under the sun, but when I saw that it was still in place, I grew cautiously optimistic -- and then I went home and did a sweaty vinyasa yoga session.

What happens to repeat offenders that aren't famous? They eventually end up doing time for their crimes, yes? Well, try telling that to the Hilton heiress, as hitting one parked car might not be a huge deal, but repeating this within a few years' time might be considered to be a problem. That is, it's a problem unless you can buy your way out of just about anything, as Paris did with her court fines. One might think that if they had enough money they could make just about any issue go away, which has been the case with some individuals.

He’s had two short spells at home because there are strict rules in place: any sneezing or coughing and you’re removed from the class. But the difference to the quality of life and to the health of the economy is incalculable. The Danes managed to begin opening schools on a rolling basis – starting with the youngest children first – just five weeks after they had locked them down. By the end of May, the oldest high school students were back in class.

The blaze, which began as two adjacent fires, was reported shortly before 5 p.m. in Cherry Valley, an unincorporated area near the city of Beaumont in Riverside County. Flames leapt along brushy ridgetops and came close to homes while some 200 firefighters fought the blaze from the ground and air, authorities said.

 Little seems normal in the age of COVID-19.
 Not the mostly empty streets of downtown Toronto, where the hustle and bustle of the business-suited crowd and tourists is down to a trickle.
 The entrances of the Royal York Hotel, where some teams are staying, were completely fenced off and covered in black tarp featuring NHL and NHL playoff logo, with a notable security presence at each entry point.
