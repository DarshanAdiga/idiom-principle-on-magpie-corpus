As for when we'll get our first official look at Dune, that could be coming up rather soon. It has been reported that the first trailer might play in front of the tenth anniversary screenings of Christopher Nolan's _Inception_ , starting on July 17th. While that has not been confirmed, the timeline makes sense, since the movie is still scheduled to hit theaters in December. However, that will all really depend on whether or not movie theaters end up opening their doors next month. As of now, there is still some uncertainty surrounding the opening of theaters and other indoor areas where large crowds can gather.

Il sottoscritto Sorce Rosario Commissario di Forza Italia di San Cataldo,in riferimento alla completamento dell'Iter per le ZES in Sicilia, con la firma definitiva del Governo Nazionale si completa fortunatamente uno Strumento straordinario che dara alle nostre Aree Industriali di Caltanissetta, San Cataldo scalo e Grottadacqua grandi opportunita in termini infrastrutturali e di fiscalita agevolata; appositamente ho usato il termine Fortunatamente in quanto nella prima edizione delle ZES in Provincia erano state escluse le aree di San Cataldo e di Grottadacqua aree ove insistono soprattutto aziende ed imprenditori Sancataldesi, i quali appena giunta ufficialita dell'Esclusione hanno cercato giustamente interlocuzioni con la Deputazione locale senza all'inizio  a detta Loro avere riscontri confortanti!    Ed ecco che per Onore di Verita e perche coinvolto in prima persona da tanti amici Imprenditori in questa Difficile ed all'inizio Impossibile Operazione di Reinserimento delle Ns Aree Industriali sopracitate che mi preme sottolineare qualche passaggio di merito sul Positivo Epilogo sfociato con la Importante e definitiva firma Ministeriale.   Quanto tutto sembrava compromesso, tant'e che gia si pensava a soluzioni alternative per le Aree di San Cataldo e Grottadacqua alla oramai sfumata occasione della ZES che coinvolgiamo l' On.le Michele Mancuso in una riunione con una nutrita partecipazione degli Imprenditori locali , i quali hanno manifestato tutta l'amarezza umana e la delusione professionale per l'accaduto, da subito l'Amico On.le Mancuso ha preso a cuore le istanze positive e costruttive dei partecipanti e si e attivato a Tutti i livelli per dare una risposta al Ns martoriato territorio, da quel momento i contatti con gli Imprenditori locali sono stati costanti e di grande collaborazione come quella generosamente espressa dall' Amico Imprenditore Lirio Orlando nel collazionare e fare recapitare all' Assessorato Regionale alle Attivita Produttive  tutti gli elaborati grafici delle aree interessate di sedime e di competenza nonche' la forza produttiva dell'area di San Cataldo sia in termini di Aziende Attive che di personale occupato; un altro grande Gesto di Generosita dei Ns Imprenditori anteponendo agli impegni personali  quelli del Bene Comune e dell' intera area industriale  e stata la  Proficua trasferta effettuata a Palermo per un incontro fissato sempre dall' On.le Mancuso con l'Assessore Regionale alle Attivita Produttive ove hanno partecipato gli Amici Imprenditori Franco e Vincenzo Guttilla, Lirio Orlando, il Sig. Virzi , Dino Giarratano , Calogero Bruno e l'Amico Pio Naro che si e offerto di accompagnare la delegazione per conto dell'On.le Mancuso!    A conclusione mi preme chiarire di non cercare visibilita o meriti  perche onestamente non interessato ne tantomeno di darne o toglierne a qualcuno che si diletta a scrivere sui social ed i mass-media , anzi mi auguro che cio' non faccia scaturire polemiche od altro, ma visto il risultato  cosi Importante ci deve vedere Tutti felici e  soddisfatti della Storica conquista , ma la mia onesta ed la mia coscienza mi impediscono di non riconoscere e per questo ringraziare chi fisicamente e politicamente si e speso tra l'altro  di dominio pubblico specie tra gli Industriali sancataldesi e questo e l'On.le Michele Mancuso che ha dato prova di seguire e curare il proprio territorio e le istanze che ne riceve con grande passione ed instancabile  dedizione!                                                                                                                                  _Rosario Sorce_                                                                                                             Commissario  Forza Italia di San Cataldo
