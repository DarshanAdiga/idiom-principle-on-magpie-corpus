"Slowly as the measures get lifted people will be able to take on more of a normal life, but just before you judge and before you make these comments take a look around. Go to a local shopping centre, look at your latest property developments and see all the people out and about doing different things and understand that players and athletes that are going to return to sport, to do what they love and to entertain fans are going to take extreme measures and be isolated to make sure it happens.

"The director of the FBI should step in and stop this bureaucratic skullduggery, and if he will not, the Attorney General should," Barr wrote. "Anti-gun state and local government officials are trying every trick in the book during this pandemic to deny law-abiding citizens the ability to exercise their rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. Americans do not need bureaucrats at the FBI making it even more difficult."

So the economic disaster we are in the middle of enduring was caused by two swamps: the medical swamp and the media swamp, and for good measure, the Democrats jumped on board as well. That made it a three-member swamp team. What a mess this swamp team has created. Over twenty million Americans unemployed!

Ideal zum Abschluss der Feiertage, die Bibelfilmparodie der britischen "Monty Python"-Anarchisten. Weil sich die drei Weisen im Stall irren, huldigen sie nicht Jesus, sondern Brian. Von nun an ist dieser Opfer von Irrtum und Verwechslung. Nach einer aberwitzigen Odyssee endet der vermeintliche Messias am Kreuz – und singt: "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"… Gotteslästerung? Nö, hier bekommen nur Fanatiker ihr Fett weg!

I've been going longer than normal between washes in isolation so when I wash my hair at the moment, it really needs it. As well as generally being grubbier, I also have a build-up of product (dry shampoo) to get rid of, so I really put this shampoo to the test. Firstly, it smells amazing. I can't quite put my finger on what it smells like but it's really fresh and not overpowering. It took a little while to foam up, I needed a second pump of product to get it going, but once it was off there was no stopping it. Afterwards my hair felt squeaky clean and I didn't need a second wash to get rid of all that build-up. Very impressed.
