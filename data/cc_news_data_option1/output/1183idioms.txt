Three US sailors from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, the first cases reported on a US Navy ship currently on deployment, officials said on Tuesday. The three have been evacuated and all those they had come into contact with on the vessel, which has more than 5,000 personnel on board, have been quarantined, Acting Navy Secretary Thomas B. Modly told reporters.
 The ship was last in port in Vietnam 15 days ago but Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday said it was difficult to connect the cases to a particular port visit. "We took great precautions when the crew came back from that shore visit, and did enhanced medical screenings of the crew," he said.
 Overall, the Navy has 86 coronavirus cases, including 57 active-duty service members, he said. Last week the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer -- currently in port in San Diego according to US media -- reported one of its personnel had tested "presumptive positive" for the virus.

aircraft is typically around 32 metres in length. Low cost airlines would have to reduce number of rows and thereby seats by almost a third. Indigo's A 320Neo that seats 186 passengers with a seat pitch of Vistara's business class would effectively seat a little over 60 passengers to reduce the possibility of infection from 11 to three passengers. To substantially reduce the risk of onboard contamination, airlines would have to also have to maintain a distance between passengers on the same row. A typical narrow bodied jet aircraft width is 3.7 metres. That would mean eliminating the six seats a row concept to three separate seats, a metre apart, in a row. Airlines would have to increase ticket prices manifold to compensate for the reduction in seats despite significant savings on fuel consumption due to lower aircraft weight.

The 2020 Southwestern High School tennis team has plenty of experience and lots of depth. With a state qualifying boys doubles team, the Warriors tennis teams were hoping for a great season this spring.
 "This group of boys and girls have been working hard since the first week of January, but we are kind of at a standstill at the moment," stated Southwestern tennis coach Lauren Childers. "With the mandated dead period by the KHSAA, we have not been able to practice since the second week of March. Everyone is in the same boat right now, too. We are hopeful that COVID-19 will pass quickly, and we can get back on the courts to play some tennis."
 "Our players, especially our seniors, have worked really hard for this season, and we hope that they will get a chance to finish up their careers," Childers explained. "Max Brainard, Josh Carey, Camden Harris, Luke Jacobs, Clark Lemon, Cameron Pierce, Josh Thomas, and Kaitlyn Munsey want an opportunity to play tennis, and we really want that for them. When we took over this team in the fall of 2016, this group of kids were freshmen. They have bought into everything we have asked them to do since day one, and we are extremely thankful for them."

 “Kind of most surprisingly is most of the people that were out there were older people, which are at the highest risk right now, and I was surprised to see so many older people out there,” he said.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.
 Charlene Richardson of Pasadena, California, played the nine-hole Eaton Canyon course in nearby Altadena last week. Ball washers were covered in plastic to prevent use and she didn’t pull the flagstick on any hole.

Athletes, national associations and sporting federations worldwide reacted with sadness, relief and mainly goodwill to the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games on Tuesday because of the coronavirus pandemic.After weeks of speculation and mounting criticism at the delay in announcing a postponement, Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and International Olympic Committee IOC President Thomas Bach agreed the event would be rescheduled for the summer of 2021 at the latest. It is the first break in the four-year cycle for the summer Olympics since the 1940 and 1944 Games were cancelled because of World War Two. Here are some reactions to the decisionIOC President Thomas Bach This Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the tunnel.-- International Paralympic Committee President Andrew ParsonsSport is not the most important thing right now, preserving human life is. --U.S. Olympic and Paralympic CEO Sarah Hirshland This summer was supposed to be a culmination of your hard work and lifes dream, but taking a step back from competition to care for our communities and each other is the right thing to do.-- World Athletics president Sebastian CoeIts by a distance the right decision.

As the coronavirus spreads across the United States, Chinese students from wealthy families are persuading their parents to pay tens of thousands of dollars for seats on private jets to get home.The alternative, in a world of locked borders and grounded commercial planes, is 60-hour flights with multiple transits hops over the Pacific. Jeff Gong, a lawyer in Shanghai, asked his daughter, a high school student in Wisconsin if she wanted 180,000 yuan 25,460 as pocket money or a ticket on a private flight home.My daughter begged me to get her back home ... She said No papa, I dont want the money, I want to go home, he told Reuters. U.S.-based Chinese students are scrambling to get home as U.S. infections top 50,000 while new cases in China - where the flu-like virus emerged in humans late last year - have fallen to zero.The sense of urgency is further heightened by the dramatic cutback in flight capacity. On Tuesday, 3,102 out of 3,800 planned commercial flights to and from China were canceled, according to aviation data provider VariFlight. Education agents and schools are the ones making contact on behalf of the Chinese families looking to group together to arrange a private charter, given the lack of airline flights, said Annelies Garcia, commercial director for Private Fly, a global booking service for charter flights.But even the window for chartered flights is closing fast, further elevating prices. Beijing has banned all chartered flights from overseas and Shanghai is expected to follow suit soon. Hong Kong and Macau have blocked transit flights. U.S-based Air Charter Service can fly passengers from Los Angeles to Shanghai on a 14-seat Bombardier 6000 for 2.3 million yuan 325,300, or about 23,000 for a spot.We have arranged a number of private jets traveling from the U.S. to China repatriating Chinese nationals with routes including New York and Boston to Shanghai, San Jose to Hong Kong and Los Angeles to Guangzhou, said Glenn Phillips, a PR, and advertising manager at Air Charter Service. The prices range greatly depending on the positioning of the aircraft on the dates and time requested, and the exact route.But even the well-heeled have to wrestle with logistics. Air charter providers have been notified informally that private jets registered in China are not allowed to land in the United States, and those registered in the United States cannot land in China, two sources at such firms told Reuters.The Chinese government is reluctant to let people abroad to come back, though they cannot make it too obvious. We have received a lot of verbal guidance to restrict chartered flights these days and the door is closing rapidly, one of them said. Jet operators circumvent the restrictions by either getting planes from other countries to run the U.S.-China routes or arranging transfers in Tokyo, they said.Operators of U.S. or Chinese-registered aircraft are not permitted to land in each others countries at the moment, so for U.S.-China route inquiries, we are working with operators of long-range jets based elsewhere, said Private Flys Garcia.

"We are hoping to find that right combination early in the season, that way our kids will have plenty of time to learn how to play with one another before the region. We have a mixture of upperclassmen and underclassmen on the girls' team, and we are excited to see what kind of season they can have in 2020. We have some players on our team that we feel can surprise some folks at the regional tournament."
 The Southwestern tennis team had a lot of potential going into the 2020 season, but now the Warriors are wondering if the season will even be played in light of the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.
 "As far as our schedule goes, we don't know how many matches we will get to play," Childers stated. "Prior to all of this, we had a pretty good schedule created with both in-region and out-of-region opponents. We tried to set our schedule up to prepare us for the regional tourney."
 "We signed up to play in the North Laurel Tennis Classic, which features teams from all across the state of Kentucky," Childers explained. "We were also going to host the Dale Yates Classic Presented by Cora Physical Therapy on April 25, which will basically be a tri-match with us, West Jessamine, and McCreary Central."

There is an interesting story which happened in these recent days. Nowadays Europe is facing a big problem of water scarcity or you can there is long, summer days going in Europe which resulted in the re-appearance of a big stone which is so-called "Hunger Stone" in the Czech Republic. But why has this Hunger Stone become big news? It is because this stone was last seen during a period of low water in 1904 in the days when the country was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Later, this stone was embedded in the Elbe River and the people did not pay any heed to the same. There are many a time that this situation happens due to the high and low amount of rainfall in parts. What is so interesting in this Hunger Stone?

 “I do know that some clients have chosen to just go on a break for the time being. Some have chosen to have trainers send them some exercises that they can do from home while we all weather the storm,” she said. “Our trainers work with clients of all ages and abilities, so some workouts that would be done in a gym setting aren’t the easiest to replicate without the proper equipment and guidance.
 “With that said, a lot of our clients are given exercises that are appropriate for them that they can complete with just their own body weight. At the end of the day, we’re really just encouraging people to keep moving their body and do what you can.”

“It’s definitely a needed distraction, especially with nothing else on at home,” said Mark Laliberte, who was playing at Highland Creek Golf Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. “I’m a father of three daughters, and my wife and my daughters and I love to watch sports. It’s crazy that there is nothing on.”
 It’s not hard for golfers to keep their distance on the fairway, but greens and especially tee boxes can become more crowded — and golf is popular among age groups most vulnerable to the virus. Can it really be safe?
 “I do think that golf is a relatively easy sport to socially distance while playing,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. His work focuses on emerging infectious disease, pandemic preparedness and biosecurity.
 “I do think that social distancing is important but I also think that some activities can be modified to limit exposure,” he said in an email.

 “Honestly, and I’m biased as you know, but if you think of anything else you could do right now, golf is social distancing day to day,” said Troy Andrew, executive director of the Washington Golf Association. “None of the general public is good enough to hit it within six feet of each other.”
 Carts can be limited to one player at a time, and players can be allowed to walk the course without one. Clubhouses and golf shops can have restricted access or be closed entirely. Players can prepay for their rounds online.

 The second item approved was a conditional permit for Katie Lin to have a residence on the second floor of a salon and spa she is opening at 304 Hawthorne Dr. The property’s current zoning does not allow for living quarters in a business.
 Lin’s representatives said she would prefer a permanent zoning change so they did not have to get another conditional use permit in the future, but the conditional use was acceptable.
 “I think there’s a way to make a happy medium,” said real estate agent Derek Schriewer, speaking from the middle of the large arch of commissioners.
 The city considered a similar request several years ago, but the applicant withdrew, City Engineer Jonathan Zimmermann told commissioners.
 Commissioners decided to allow the permit conditionally.
 “I would prefer to keep it conditional use, just in case someone wants to change it, we can keep some control of it,” Bailey said.
 The moves must still be approved by the board of aldermen. And, with hair salons among the businesses Franklin County closed this week, Lin’s business will not be able to open until at least April 17.

Often when I shuffle outside for a few minutes, I’ve just smoked, which adds to the weirdness.

 There are 60 shooters in the club this season, ranging from 10 to 18 years old, and of all skill levels from beginner to state champion. It’s easy for beginners to rack up medals showing their progress through the ranks of accuracy and skill, but as time goes on and they get better and better, the margin of error shrinks and shrinks. And that’s what makes shooting such a mentally-intensive sport, Haycock said.
 “The margin of error with the top shooters is so small there is very little room for it, so it’s easy to get down on yourself, right?” Haycock said.

I wish I could give you the magic HTML tag or line of .htaccess that would solve this problem, but when the situation is changing day-by-day or even hour-by-hour, many of our best practices fall apart. We can't apply ordinary solutions to extraordinary problems.      In this unique case, I think the most important thing, from an SEO standpoint, is to maintain the ranking power of the page, and that probably means leaving it alone. Any technical wizardry we can perform ends at the point that search bots take over, and the process of re-crawling and re-caching a page takes time. Our best bet is to provide an experience that gives search visitors options and maintains the page's value. While this will require investment in the short-term, these changes could equate to thousands of dollars in revenue and will continue to produce benefits even when life returns to normal.

Let’s start with a cough. It’s one of the more common symptoms of lung cancer, and it appears in up to half of all patients. This can be a new and persistent cough that isn’t associated with a cold or the flu, or it can be a chronic cough that gradually becomes worse. These coughs may be painful, and they may produce red or rust-colored phlegm or sputum, which indicates the presence of blood. Any time that you cough up blood — whether it is bright red, which indicates new blood, or a darker hue, which signals old blood — it’s important to see a doctor.

 All three broadcasters have made adjustments to their normal routines. Schmitt has spent more time with his grandchildren, while Stotelmyer took a camping trip with his wife and one of his granddaughters. Stotelymyer also has been doing "a lot of small jobs that you put off during the non-sports season" among other interests.
 "I've caught up on watching some of my old-time TV shows," he said.
 To adjust, Leach has focused on his daily radio show which has already switched into summer mode, coming up with different topics of interest, especially when it comes to the Wildcats.
 "I'm used to doing that in the summer when there are no games," he said. "It's not so much of a show focused on sports, but we take a look back at previous games and a look ahead of the upcoming season, recruiting and all of those kinds of things.
 "We had to get in that mode earlier than usual and plus, realize that no one is focused in the upcoming season yet until we can kind of get a light at the end of the tunnel with what are dealing with in this medical crisis. Once that happens, hopefully, sooner rather than later, people will really be craving the hope and looking ahead to the start and resumption of what sports will bring."
 In addition to Schmitt and Stotelmyer, Leach has spent quality time with his family during the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
 "We've had more family dinners this week than we've had in a while," he said. "At least that part has been nice."
