One thing this national tragedy has reinforced for me is the resiliency of the American people. Citizens have been called upon to do extraordinary things every day for months and months.

When Wells College President Jonathan Gibralter contacted my office seeking access to thousands of test kits, Kathleen was my first call.

This type of procedure can also be referred to as 3D LIPO, cryolipolysis or simply as "fat freeze". Using a natural process, the technology destroys the fat cells in the body whilst not having any destructive effect on other cells such as the skin cells. This process leads to a typical reduction of around 25 to 40 per cent in the overall thickness of the fat layer that is targeted. To achieve this, the fat cells must be carefully cooled to a temperature that drops below -9 degrees centigrade.

La sua ricerca si è diffusa in modo virale su forum popolari come Tianya, e ha guadagnato milioni di seguaci. Fu il primo a sottolineare che la Cina non avrebbe mai avuto 4 miliardi di persone e che tutte le proiezioni sulla popolazione di Pechino dagli anni Settanta in poi si erano sbagliate.

Dopo la sua ricerca pionieristica, le voci per la riforma sono diventate sempre più forti. Yi ha subito censure, ovviamente, e per anni non gli è stato permesso di mettere piede in Cina. Quando la Cina ha allentato la sua politica del figlio unico, Yi è stato invitato a tornare, ha tenuto seminari in molte università e forum accademici, è diventato una figura popolare sia tra i maoisti di sinistra che tra i pro riforma. Davvero, anche dalla Cina possono venire notizie belle…
