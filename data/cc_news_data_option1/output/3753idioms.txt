However, once an entity makes itself an intelligence target by stealing the CIA's tools, all bets are off. Whether surveillance is only for intelligence or for potential prosecution, they're obliged to examine every anal polyp. The danger with Assange is prosecuting for more journalistic activity revealing atrocities in Iraq, et al - embarrassing, but what hard-hitting journalists should do. Trying to interfere with an intelligence service, then revealing their tools and tactics to the enemy? Well, fuck Assange very much. He both screwed the USA and made journalist's jobs much harder. Sadly Reality Winner got caught in the backlash - even if she had spent a year in the pen for divulging needed info, it was worth it. But now it's hugely punitive and unfair, considering people like Stone, Erik Prince, and Manafort are all out.

One must never cry for Yglesias, though, he's got that utter kind of laid-back confidence that is instilled by the best private schools where you learn that everyone with power is actually another person with flaws just like you. As usual he's snarking as much as he can about the whole thing, and is throwing in self-deprecation jokes once in a while, as far as he can take it without upsetting Ezra Klein (nominally his "boss") with whom he made an agreement about what kind of social media commentary he would do after this latest brouhaha.

In your overwrought response you ignore the point of the piece entirely and do not challenge a single statement of fact as presented in the article, and there are a lot of them about the people that the article is actually about, people that are not Biden. Your main point about the article itself which you think is significant is that the couple million for a book and $540,000 a year for a non-job is just trivial bucks in the world where Biden operates. That is true enough but in making the only pertinent part of your rant be about how Biden got his money fair and square you are defending a charge that was not made. Have you looked up the definition of troll lately.

"I think human nature, when everybody's patting you on the back, maybe you relax a little bit," Napier said. "I feel like we practiced well. I feel like practice was up to par. I do think that, no matter what, some of that has a residual effect on you. I think it's important we learned a good lesson here."
