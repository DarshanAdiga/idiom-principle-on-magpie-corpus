Admissions to the high school section of the Government Pre-University College at Megaravalli in Thirthahalli taluk have improved this academic year, thanks to the initiatives by the school staff to teach students online. Last year, 40 had taken admission to Class 8. This year it has already reached 70, and a a few more are set to join in the coming days. Interestingly, a few students left private schools at Thirthahalli to join this school.
 Many parents chose this school as teachers keep students engaged with studies during the days of COVID-19 pandemic. All 38 students of SSLC and a majority of those in Class 8 and 9 are in regular touch with teachers online. “We have completed teaching one chapter each in Mathematics and Science already”, said Raghavendra Bhat, a science teacher.
 This all started when the teachers returned to school in the first week of June. With no work on hand to teach, they thought of online teaching. Initially, they collected the contact numbers of all students and created groups on Whatsapp. The teachers met students and parents personally and sought their cooperation. “By and large all families had smartphones, but parents were using them. Many handed over their phones to their children, and they bought new phones. In some homes, they had no smartphones but purchased afresh. Around 15 per cent of students could not afford them. We have managed to reach them through other students or our old students residing in the same village”, said Mr. Bhat.
 Right now, online classes are being conducted on google meet application for SSLC students. However, many are facing network issues. S.S. Shreshtha, a resident of Karagodu near Kundadri, told _The Hindu_ that she had to go to an elevated place near her house to attend the online class. “Due to poor network, I miss a few things. However, teachers send diagrams and text through Whatsapp, which help to understand the subjects better. Moreover, they give us homework and we submit them online and they are evaluated and returned within a few minutes”, she said. Another student, M.B. Sadwini of Megaravalli, said the online classes would not be as good as one in a classroom. “But, this initiative has been helpful for us. Teachers are enthusiastic and respond to all our queries”, she said. The teachers are also happy with the students’ response. “No matter, whatever we do, it is a temporary measure. The virtual class cannot replace the actual class”, opined Mr. Raghavendra Bhat.
 The 70-year-old school with six sections has got only five rooms. Two classes have to be combined to accommodate the strength. “Now the strength has increased because of our initiatives. We need extra rooms once the classes reopen. Requests have been submitted to the department”, said M.S. Divakar, headmaster.

Roughly three months before Election Day, a new poll from&nbsp;The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research&nbsp;finds that Biden's supporters are less enthusiastic than Trump's — both about the campaign itself and about their candidate — although the&nbsp;Democrat's coalition may be equally motivated by anxiety.Still, the poll reveals an American public at odds with Trump on&nbsp;wearing masks, on&nbsp;balancing restrictions to stop the virus with efforts to help the economy&nbsp;and on&nbsp;fully reopening schools. And voters give Biden higher marks on many positive traits that apply to leadership in the age of&nbsp;the coronavirus, including honesty, capability and caring for Americans.Sherek's assessment of the candidates highlights the nuanced motivations underlying the so-called enthusiasm gap, which has raised concerns among Biden's allies who worry the deficit could undermine his candidacy once voting begins.While interest in the presidential campaign is high across the board, just 31% of Biden supporters say they're excited, compared with 42% of Trump supporters. Biden's coalition is fueled by more negative emotions: 72% of Biden supporters, but 52% of Trump supporters, say they feel anxious about the 2020 campaign. The same disparity exists for frustration with the election, 65% for Biden supporters and 45% for Trump's.Anya Kumar, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate from Columbia, Missouri, vowed to vote for Biden this fall but conceded many of her young friends who oppose Trump don't feel much passion for the former vice president. Many aren't even registered, she said.“For the most part, people I know really just don’t want Trump,” Kumar said, acknowledging that she is motivated more by anxiety about Trump’s reelection than genuine excitement about his Democratic rival. “If Biden doesn’t win, that would suck.”Biden's team largely dismisses the idea of an enthusiasm gap. It says that with Trump's level of support shrinking, a greater share of energized supporters is left behind in the diminished pool. Indeed, Trump's job approval in the new poll sits at 38%, within the narrow range that has endured throughout his presidency but down from relative highs earlier this year.Just 32% of voters approve of&nbsp;the way Trump is handling the pandemic, a low point that follows a steady decline from the outset of the crisis. While Trump's supporters almost unanimously approve of his performance overall, 2 in 10 disapprove of his response to the pandemic.Stacey Rogus, 43, a Republican from Glendale, Arizona, who works in the medical industry, admitted some concerns about Trump. She says the president is narcissistic, doesn’t act as “presidential” as she’d like and doesn’t think before he speaks. But Rogus is determined to vote for him a second time because of his economic policies and support for the U.S.-Mexico border wall.She also suspects that Trump’s political opponents are exaggerating the threat of the coronavirus pandemic to hurt his reelection. She finds&nbsp;the timing of the outbreak&nbsp;“a little odd.”“He didn’t make the virus,” Rogus said. “If anything, maybe the Democrat party created it just to make him look bad.” (The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has&nbsp;ruled out the virus being human-made&nbsp;and noted that is the scientific consensus as well.)The poll also found that voters generally prefer Biden’s character and values. About 6 in 10 registered voters say that values like “cares about people like you,” “honest” and “strong leader” do not describe Trump well. By comparison, roughly the same majority say those characteristics describe Biden at least somewhat well.And in considering whether the two are “capable” — a question that likely reflects voters’ views of each man’s mental acuity and ability to govern — fewer say that describes Trump than Biden at least somewhat well, 43% vs. 56%. Trump, who’s 74, and his allies have made attacks against Biden’s age and cognitive ability&nbsp;a centerpiece of their message.Trump has an advantage on standing up for what he believes. Seventy percent think this describes Trump at least somewhat well, including 54% who think it describes him very well. Sixty-three percent think standing up for his beliefs describes Biden at least somewhat well, but just 36% think it describes him very well.Trump’s supporters are much stronger in their positive descriptions of Trump than Biden backers are of their candidate. For example, wide majorities of Trump supporters think “stands up for what he believes” (87%), “strong leader” (75%) and “capable” (76%) describe the president very well. Fewer Biden supporters think “standing up for what he believes” (63%), “strong leader” (50%) and “capable” (56%) describe Biden very well.For Biden, a significant age gap within his coalition drives the lukewarm ratings. Older Biden supporters are much more likely than those under 45 to say such traits describe Biden very well.Terrance Berinato, a 72-year-old Democrat from Front Royal, Virginia, who said he’ll definitely vote for Biden and describes Trump as “the worst president we’ve ever had, period.” He acknowledged that Trump supporters may be more excited about their candidate, but he predicted it wouldn’t matter given that Trump’s overall support is shrinking.“I’m sure Trump supporters, the 30% or 40% of people who would follow him to hell, are very enthused,” Berinato said.___Peoples reported from New York.___The AP-NORC poll of 1,057 adults, including 922 registered voters, was conducted July 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

AUSTIN, Texas (KXAN/CNN) - Protesters took to downtown Austin streets again Sunday night, this time in memory of Garrett Foster, 28, one of their own who was shot and killed at a Black Lives Matter protest Saturday night. Family members and friends of Garrett Foster are sharing a GoFundme page - with a photo of him and his fiancée. James Sasinowski, who was a speaker at Saturday evening’s protest and spoke with the couple, said Foster was seen pushing his fiancée in her wheelchair during the protests most nights this summer. “Kind of hard to miss dude pushing a quadriplegic in a wheelchair with I believe an AK-47, some kind of large rifle on his body,” Sasinowski said. He said he was marching near the couple when a black car, seen in witness video, turned into a crowd of protesters. "I was kind of looking forward and back over my shoulder, and while I was looking forward was when I heard the first shot," Sasinowski said. He said when he looked back, he saw the driver of the car’s arm sticking out the window “holding a handgun in his hand, in his left hand, and I saw two or three rounds get fired and the flashes on the top of the slide into the crowd.” Sasinowski says he didn’t see Foster fire his weapon. He recalls seeing the driver speed off before hearing three more shots. “I look back, and we all kind of collectively see Garrett, we see Garrett on the ground in the middle of the road in like the fetal position with a pool of blood next to him, and I saw his face,” Sasinowski said. “I don’t know how far away I was from Garrett. It felt like I was right there. He was just trying to hold on to his life.” "It's just a tragic event," said&nbsp;Mark Bay, who said he's attended about a dozen protests. "I'm here to show solidarity for the movement that he died for and also to remember him and to continue the fight." Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said&nbsp;just before 10 p.m., a car turned onto Congress Avenue, approaching a crowd of protesters. “As the crowd surrounds his vehicle, and as some of the protesters are striking his vehicle, his account is that Mr. Foster pointed the weapon directly at him, and he fired his handgun at Mr. Foster,” he said. Manley said Foster may have pointed his weapon toward the driver but believes Foster did not shoot. He also says the suspect called himself in. “Among the callers to Austin 911 was a subject to stated they had just been involved in a shooting and drinking away from the scene,” he said.Manley says the suspect has been released pending further investigation. Bay said the gun violence concerns him, but not enough to keep him home. “You always have to consider risks when you come to a protest or do anything. It’s not just this, it’s COVID, too, but I think the cause is worth it. I really believe in racial equality. I really believe in justice for all, so I’m going to continue protesting,” he said.Copyright 2020 KXAN via CNN. All rights reserved.

Good morning, troops. It's Monday, July 27.
   
 Right about now, some Peoria-area teenagers probably should be wading in the Bodensee. Or taking a ride in an airship. Or perhaps even taking a legal sip of a fine German hefeweizen, almost at its source.
   
 Instead, the coronavirus pandemic derailed what's believed to be the longest- running foreign youth-exchange program in the United States.
   
 For the first time since its 1978 establishment, the exchange of 16-to-20-year-olds between Peoria and its sister city of Friedrichshafen, Germany, did not take place.
   
 This year's version would have sent a dozen or so Peoria teens and their adult chaperones to Friedrichshafen from about July 15 to Aug. 5. It was arranged to take place about the same time as Seehasenfest, an annual civic celebration in Friedrichshafen, which hugs the Lake Constance shore in southern Germany.
   
 Seehasenfest was canceled, another byproduct of COVID-19.
   
 Friends of Friedrichshafen, a local group that helps foster the sister-city tie, decided in April to suspend the youth exchange this year.
   
 "We were just concerned that if somebody was over there that caught (COVID), somehow that they could become very sick and we wouldn't be able to get them back to their family," said Dee Walker, the Friends of Friedrichshafen president.
   
 Once the decision was made, Friends of Friedrichshafen notified the Peoria Club, its German counterpart.
   
 "I think they felt the same way as us," Walker said. "They were really sad to see us cancel it, but they agreed."
   
 Peoria Club executive Karin Seckinger confirmed that sorrow in an email.
   
 "The first time in (42) years we have had to cancel," stated Seckinger, who in 1981 visited Peoria as part of the exchange.
   
 Peoria and Friedrichshafen have been sister cities since 1976. The relationship stems from ties between Caterpillar Inc., the construction- equipment giant formerly based in Peoria, and Zeppelin Baumaschinen GmbH.
   
 Based in Friedrichshafen and with roots in airship construction, Zeppelin is the largest Caterpillar dealer in Europe. Zeppelin Museum Friedrichshafen is a major feature along the waterfront in the city of about 60,000 residents.
   
 Youth-exchange participants reside with host families during their three-week visit. Seeing local and regional sites, sampling local culture and forging international friendships are the goals.
   
 In even-numbered years, Peoria youths visit Germany. Friedrichshafen youths visit Peoria in odd-numbered years.
   
 That order might change in 2021.
   
 Friends of Friedrichshafen is proposing delaying the 2020 exchange until next year. The group of Peorians scheduled to travel this year would visit Friedrichshafen then.
   
 "We think that the students signed up for this year would still be interested next year," Walker said. "They're still within the age range. If we waited two years, we'd have to start completely over from scratch."
   
 Walker was awaiting whether the Peoria Club concurs.
   
 Adult exchanges between the cities are scheduled for next year to help commemorate the 45th anniversary of the twinning. Informal, back-and-forth travel among Friedrichshafen and Peoria adults has been taking place for decades.
   
 But the youth exchange appears to occupy a special place for those on both sides of the Atlantic who help perpetuate the sister-city relationship.
   
 "I think that because the host communities value it so much, we think it'll be able to continue into the future," Walker said. "The kids that do go have such a great experience."
   
 A tune about another, unidentified European city came up in the random YouTube search for a song not heard on the way to work.

We are watching a show. It’s important to keep that in mind.
 It has its villains — Mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland and other supporters of the “liberal, radical left” idea that people have the right peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
 It has its victims, people in towns where they don’t have or need symphony orchestras and art museums and the very idea of street protests fills them with existential horror.
 And the show has its hero, too, Donald John Trump, getting tough with those lawless cities, standing between the victims and their fears and not bothering overmuch about constitutional niceties while he does.
 That’s how you end up with the recent spectacle of at least one person reportedly snatched off the streets of Portland by federal agents bearing no badges or identifying insignia and stuffed into an unmarked van on no probable cause, or even an allegation of crime. At this writing, Trump is sending federal agents — using, presumably, the same tactics — to Chicago, which, in his telling, teeters on the edge of criminal anarchy, and he, alone, can save it.
 If it smacks of despotism, this idea of government seizing those who — it bears repeating — are accused of no crime, well, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf tells Fox “News” that sometimes you have to “proactively arrest” people. It’s a nicely dystopian term that might have come out of “The Minority Report,” the 1956 novella by Philip K. Dick (also a 2002 film starring Tom Cruise), which posits a world where “precogs” divine the future, enabling police to prevent crime instead of just solving it. Dick provides other terms Wolf might find useful: “precrime,” “potential criminals,” “prophylactic pre-detection.”
 If it occurs to you there’s no such thing as “precogs,” if this all seems to you like a civil liberties nightmare, well, you’re missing the point. Again, this is a show.
 And give him his due. Trump may have failed as a businessman, an educator, an airline mogul, a casino operator, a steak salesman and a human being, but he knows how to put on a show. He also knows every moment we spend talking about American fascism is a moment not spent talking about Russia putting a price on American heads, which in turn keeps us from talking about the 143,000 who’ve died of a virus Trump said would magically disappear.
 Even his distractions have distractions.
 In fairness, this march toward fascist dystopia didn’t begin in Portland. For years, we saw Black and Hispanic men stopped and frisked in New York City without probable cause. We’ve seen cops empowered to take your money and border agents empowered to seize and search your laptops and smartphones, also without probable cause. In 2015, we saw a woman named Charnesia Corley subjected to a police search of her vagina on the pavement at a gas station.
 What we haven’t seen so much is public outrage.
 So Trump’s innovation is not stomping the Constitution, but making the stomping a show. If it doesn’t seem like much of one to you, well, you’re not the intended audience. For them, this is Dirty Harry and Rambo all rolled into one. For the rest of us, this show isn’t about a tough guy. Rather, it’s about a second-rate magician whose act has seen better days, whose top hat is worn, whose cards are frayed, whose every move reeks of flop-sweat desperation, the terror that he might be seen as he really is.
 Which makes this magician dangerous in the same way a cornered animal is. And if we aren’t careful, he may pull off one last trick.
 He may make freedom disappear.
