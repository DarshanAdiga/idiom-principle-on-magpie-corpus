Cordaro Freddrick Reid, 32, was charged with possession of methamphetamine with purpose to deliver, a Class B felony; possession of a depressant with purpose to deliver, a Class B felony; possession of drug paraphernalia, a Class D felony; driving on a suspended license, an unclassified misdemeanor; no liability insurance, an unclassified misdemeanor, an unclassified misdemeanor; an an equipment violation, an unclassified misdemeanor; following the Nov. 7 incident.
 According to a probable cause affidavit, a UCA officer opted to pull over the black Jeep Grand Cherokee that Reid was driving around 9:45 p.m. Nov. 7 after noticing the vehicle’s right brake light was out.
 When asked for his driver’s license, Reid reportedly told officer Shad Foley that he did not have his license with him and that he was headed to pick up the vehicle’s owner, adding that because the vehicle was not his, he did not know where the insurance and registration paperwork was.
 The officer asked Reid if his driver’s license was valid, and Reid claimed it was. However, the report states the officer soon found out Reid was a parolee who had a suspended driver’s license and active search waiver filed against him.
 At this point, the report states authorities decided to search the vehicle as well as Reid’s pockets. Prior to the search, the 32-year-old Alma man told police the vehicle’s owner had a medical marijuana card and that she also had a glass pipe in the vehicle.
 Before police searched the vehicle in question, the report states one of the officers noticed there was a beer can in the front cup holder.
 According to the affidavit, officers on scene did not find anything other than the marijuana pipe Reid warned them of in the Grand Cherokee. Just before officers searched his pockets, the report states Reid cautioned authorities about a knife he had.
 After taking the knife out of Reid’s pockets, the report states officers found a butane torch lighter in the man’s front right pocket. They also found other contraband under his shirt.

 Online court records show that the Guy police chief alerted sheriff’s officials that 74-year-old Samuel Dean Hess had been staying at a residence on Church Street in Guy. Hess, who was convicted of child molestation in February 1997, is the registered sex offender the FCSO investigator had attempted to locate on Nov. 9 during the compliance check on Autumn Hills Road.
 According to a probable cause affidavit filed against the 74-year-old sex offender, Hess was notified in early-October he could not stay at the residence in question on Church Street.
 Hess attempted to register his residency at the Church Street home upon his release from the Arkansas Department of Corrections but was not allowed to do so because he is a Level 3 sex offender and the residence in question was located near the city park and within 2,000 feet of a church that provides childcare services, the affidavit states.
 Online records also indicate Hess attempted to register at a residence on Cedar Street in Greenbrier but could not stay there because the home was too close to Matthews Park.
 After telling authorities on Oct. 26 he would register under a homeless status, Hess reportedly updated his information two days later, saying he planned to move to a residence at 72A Autumn Hills Road, according to court documents.
 Guy Police Chief Chris Humphrey called the sheriff’s office on Nov. 9 to confirm whether Hess was a registered sex offender, the report states.
 After verifying the 74-year-old was a registered sex offender, the report states the Guy police chief alerted sheriff’s officials that he believed Hess was actually living at the residence on Church Street in Guy.
 “Chief Humphrey told me that he witnessed Mr. Hess [at the Church Street residence] on Wednesday, [Nov. 4], Thursday, [Nov. 5], Friday, [Nov. 6], and again on Monday, [Nov. 9],” FCSO Registered Sex Offender Coordinator Vanda Phillips wrote in her report. “[Humphrey] advised that when he drove by on Monday, [Nov. 9], Mr. Hess seen him and quickly went into the residence from outside. Chief Humphrey advised that he has witnessed [Hess] there at different times of the day each time.”
 The report states that after Phillips spoke with the Guy police chief, she requested Freeman to conduct a compliance check at 72A Autumn Hills Road.
 “Inv. Freeman advised me that Mr. Hess was not present at the address and no contact was made with anyone at this address. He then spoke to neighbors (unknown names) who stated that they witnessed [Hess] there a couple of times but [had] not seen him since and that was ‘about a week or so’ ago,” Phillips wrote in her report.
 Online records show that the Guy Police Department arrested Hess on Nov. 10 and that he was booked into the Faulkner County Detention Center at 3:28 p.m. Nov. 10. The 74-year-old remains behind bars in lieu of a $5,000 bond and is awaiting a Nov. 23 plea and arraignment hearing.

That doesn't mean it was easy, especially for Anthrop, who was responsible for establishing the Lakers' video infrastructure in a setting that had never been done before. He had to plan knowing that emergency runs to Best Buy wouldn't be an option. Beyond his video-coordinator work, Anthrop works with the Lakers' analytics staff to streamline the resources being brought to coaches and players, and serves in a player-development role.
 "I'm still a practice player when Coach Vogel needs me," Anthrop said. "That was my favorite part of the Bubble, actually. The Jared Dudleys, and the Quinn Cooks, the guys who need to stay in shape and stay active, they'd play four- on-four or five-on-five, and if they needed an extra body, I'd be out there."
 That in mind, even the fun stuff was work.
 All worthwhile, though.
 It's fair to suggest no one has ever been happier leaving the Happiest Place on Earth than the Lakers were last month. Not only to get out of Disneyland after being holed up from late July to mid-October, kept on site, undergoing daily and rigorous COVID testing, but to do so with a championship, James having added another line to his résumé as an all-time great, Vogel to have won it all for the first time in his career as part of one of the league's flagship franchises, and all of it to have happened to conclude a season spent mourning a Lakers legend.
 "Everything was worthwhile for us," said Anthrop, who months earlier had begun his off-season routine after the league shut down in March, not knowing whether the season would resume or not. "The sacrifice that not only the players and the coaches and all the staff members made being away from their families, taking a chance and going to something we didn't know if it was going to work or not. And then obviously, coming together and be able to actually win is is incredible."
 For the 30-year-old Anthrop, it was the highlight to this point of an eventful career that started with an internship with the Pacers, an hour down the road from West Lafayette, where his parents and three brothers still live.
 "I'm the only one in my family who's ever had to move to take a job," Anthrop said, "and for me, it felt like I was moving away to the big city when I went to Indianapolis."
 They got bigger and bigger.
 Next came a G.A. job at St. John's in New York City, followed by NBA stints with the Magic in Orlando and Grizzlies in Memphis. Anthrop was just settling in as video coordinator at Vanderbilt in Nashville, when Vogel called to ask him to interview in L.A.
 Among those who've hired Anthrop already in his career: Chris Mullin, Jerry Stackhouse and Kurt Rambis, all household names in NBA circles.
 "It's pretty wild to think of some of the some of the people I've been able to not only work for, but just get to know as people," Anthrop said.
 And now, to think of where it has all taken him.

Pittman includes himself in “the will be fine,” category, too.
 In COVID-19 quarantine since Nov. 9 which included staying home while associate head coach/defensive coordinator Barry Odom served as acting head coach last Saturday night in Gainesville, Florida, Pittman is optimistic he will test COVID-19 negative and return at the office and in practice to work after a week of meeting with his team and staff on Zoom.
 “I feel really good,” Pittman said. “I’ll be back in the office on Wednesday. I sure appreciate everybody. Ol’ Daddy told me a long time ago the world don’t rotate around my butt but it sure felt like it with all the well wishes and all those things and I sure do appreciate it.”
 Asked about the COVID symptoms that affected him, Pittman cited fatigue and a sore back.
 How difficult was it watching last Saturday night’s game on TV quarantined in a pool house with his bulldog, Lucy, versus coaching on the sideline?
 “Watching the game was difficult because you are just not there and for whatever reason you feel like your presence might have something to do with the game,” Pittman said. “I don't want to give myself that much credit, but I just missed being around the guys.”
 Since he’s even quarantined from his wife, Jamie, Lucy was his lone TV companion.
 “Lucy doesn't say much and she wasn't too much into the game you know,” Pittman said. “So I kinda had to be myself on that one.”
 While Pittman missed a game, his team has played every game scheduled so far.
 Coach Ed Orgeron’s Tigers have endured two COVID-19 postponements. The first versus Florida because the Gators suffered an early-season outbreak and then LSU suffered its own outbreak and postponed last Saturday’s game scheduled against Alabama.
 “You know, it’s unfortunate for them because they haven’t played in 21 days,” Pittman said.
