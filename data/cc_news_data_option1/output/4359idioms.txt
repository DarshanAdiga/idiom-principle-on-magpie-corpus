How Snapchat Built A Business By Confusing Olds." Khaled, then 40, appeared in the accompanying photo looking slightly perplexed himself. Becoming the King of Snapchat is a #majorkey to Khaled's nomination. With a personality as seismic as his anthems, the radio personality-turned-superproducer gained around six million followers in six months. He posted everything on the social media network from "major key" affirmations to his misadventures while temporarily lost at sea one night on a jet ski. By fashioning himself into a ubiquitous digital presence, he expanded his fanbase and attracted a younger demographic. It's translated to real currency in today's attention economy. Already bigger than life in hip-hop, he suddenly became recognizable by soccer moms ‚Äî and surely some of the Recording Academy's voting bloc. It reflects a new industry reality in which music is viewed less as viable product than promotional. In such an environment, the king of self-promotion is already the winner. Bless up.

It‚Äôs fun to experiment with new software that isn‚Äôt anywhere near the polished article. But there‚Äôs associated risks, even with open source software. You‚Äôll invest time and effort in learning new software. That software might never even see a stable release, it might be a big time sink even getting it up-and- running on your system. The upside is that promising software might turn overnight into a huge success, or it might be a slow burn success. And while there‚Äôs a huge array of open source successes, there‚Äôs been awful open source failures along the way. It can be a bumpy ride!

Zeta raked across the Yucatan Peninsula Tuesday, striking as a hurricane, before weakening to a tropical storm. Hurricane warnings stretched from Morgan City, Louisiana, along the Mississippi coast to the Alabama state line. The tropical storm warning along the coast of the Florida panhandle has been extended eastward to the Walton/Bay County Line. Early Wednesday, the storm had sustained winds of 85 mph (136 kph) and was centered 320 miles (514 kilometers) south-southwest of the Mississippi River‚Äôs mouth.The center of Zeta will approach the northern Gulf coast Wednesday and make landfall in southeastern Louisiana in the afternoon, according the National Hurricane Center. Zeta will move close to the Mississippi coast Wednesday evening, and move across the southeastern and eastern United States on Thursday.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards asked President Donald Trump for a disaster declaration ahead of the storm. He and Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey both declared emergencies, as did Mayor Andrew ‚ÄúFoFo‚Äù Gilich in Biloxi, Mississippi. Trump declared an emergency for Louisiana Tuesday evening.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no doubt that we‚Äôve seen a lot this year, with COVID and so many threats from so many storms,‚Äù Gilich said in a news release, ‚Äúbut this storm shows that we haven‚Äôt seen it all yet.‚ÄùThe storm approached as New Orleans officials announced that a turbine that generates power to the city‚Äôs aging drainage pump system broke down Sunday, with no quick repair in sight. There was enough power to keep the pumps operating if needed but it left authorities with little excess power to tap should a breakdown of other turbines occur, officials said at a news conference with Mayor LaToya Cantrell. Officials said they were running through contingencies to provide power and make repairs where needed should there be other equipment problems. Forecasts, meanwhile, called for anywhere from 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 centimeters) of rain to fall in the New Orleans area. Officials noted that Zeta is expected to be a relatively fast-moving storm, possibly mitigating the flood threat. Zeta broke the record for the previous earliest 27th Atlantic named storm that formed Nov. 29, 2005. It‚Äôs also the 11th hurricane of the season. An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms.The extraordinarily busy hurricane season has focused attention on the role of climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.Louisiana has been hit by two tropical storms and two hurricanes: Laura, blamed for at least 27 Louisiana deaths after it struck in August, and Delta, which exacerbated Laura‚Äôs damage in the same area just weeks later. New Orleans has been in the warning area for potential tropical cyclones seven times this year but has seen them veer to the east or west.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to be as lucky with this one,‚Äù city emergency director Colin Arnold said.Another approaching storm piled on more worries for evacuees from previous hurricanes. The state is sheltering about 3,600 evacuees from Laura and Delta, most in New Orleans area hotels.‚ÄúI‚Äôm physically and mentally tired,‚Äù a distraught Yolanda Lockett of Lake Charles said, standing outside a New Orleans hotel.Meanwhile, many along the coast renewed an unwanted ritual of preparation.On Dauphin Island, off the Alabama coast, workers at Dauphin Island Marina prepared for Zeta, although there was little left to protect after Hurricane Sally hit in September. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any docks or fuel pumps at this point. Sally took it all out,‚Äù employee Jess Dwaileebe said. In Louisiana‚Äôs coastal St. Bernard Parish, east of New Orleans, Robert Campo readied his marina, again, for an approaching storm. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre down for four or five days, that‚Äôs four or five days nobody‚Äôs fishing. That‚Äôs four or five days nobody is shrimping. That‚Äôs four or five days, no economic wheels are turning,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like it,‚Äù Thomas Hymel, an extension agent in Jeanerette with the LSU Agricultural Center, said of this year‚Äôs series of storms and other troubles. He said the storms have meant more than a month of down time for seafood harvesters, many of whom are suffering a drop in demand from restaurants due to the coronavirus pandemic.___Santana reported from Shell Beach, Louisiana.
