“Let’s figure out how to get everybody going again. Let’s make sure we reconnect with all our fans,” Bradley said in a conference call. “And whether it’s in one site, whether it’s a short season that gets into the playoffs, I think what we will see when we finally get started again is that everybody will be completely on board and completely committed to the fact that after all of us worked together to move through the challenge of this period, the game is going. And then we will be excited to partake in anything that gets put together.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

A London-based company that sells sky lanterns has taken to social media to urge people wanting to show their support to the NHS to launch them as part of the celebration.
 However organisations across the country have begged people to ignore the suggestion – pointing out that sky lanterns are potentially very dangerous.
 The Welsh government has banned sky lanterns from public land and beaches – and there have been calls for the UK government to follow suit.
 They can start fires when they land, they can fall to the ground on fields and injure livestock, and they can litter the countryside once they come down to land.

In "The Mountains Sing," the debut novel from the award-winning poet, a girl named Hu'o'ng grows from child to young woman around the end of the Vietnam War and the conflict's aftermath. Her father is missing and her mother has gone off in search of him. Her grandmother, Diệu Lan, makes difficult choices to try to ensure their safety. In the midst of this, Hu'o'ng's world view is shaped not just by the devastation she has witnessed, but by the books she reads and the history of her family and nation passed down to her through Diệu Lan's stories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Kanpur Smart City Ltd (KSCL) has established an artificial intelligence tool for administration work to be carried out during the ongoing nationwide lockdown. KSCL has roped in Tech Mahindra to set up a COVID-19 control room to manage tracking of coronavirus patients, lockdown violations, supply of essential items and health supplies, among others.
 "As the COVID-19 outbreak disrupts the socio-economic order of the country, city administrations and the private sector are collaborating to maximise their efforts towards fighting the pandemic," KSCL CEO and Municipal Commissioner Akshay Tripathi told PTI. He added that with the help of Tech Mahindra, the COVID-19 War Room Contact Centre was made live in record time and is equipped with real-time and historical reporting. "Remote training sessions have also been provided to on-ground resources to minimise downtime." He said police, municipal and health departments are linked to the control room.
 "We have given a toll-free number. Officers are working round the clock at integrated command and control centres to handle grievances that people convey to us over phone. We are providing e-pass through a WhatsApp number and manually as well," Tripathi said. He said 12 hotspots have been identified in Kanpur that are being controlled by 10 police stations and being monitored through CCTVs installed at various places in the city. We are facilitating home delivery of essentials.
 As on April 14, there were 11 coronavirus positive patients in Kanpur, out of which 10 cases are active. "UP is like a 10th largest country in the world in terms of population. Kanpur is the oldest city where we have deployed smart city solutions. In an old city like Kanpur, challenges are much more magnified. We were able to set up systems for the control room in 24 hours," Tech Mahindra Corporate Affairs and Business Head (Asia-Pacific) Sujit Baksi said.
 The company has deployed solutions in seven smart cities. Tech Mahindra is also providing geo-fencing solutions to restrict COVID-19 patients. Baski, however, did not provide details where geo-fencing solution using GPS tracking is being used in India.

Because music is seasonal and makes up two-thirds of Paradigm's revenue, the agency borrows money during the winter months only to pay it all back and make its profits in the summer time when concert tours are in full swing. Top clients like Billie Eilish and Kenny Chesney were starting their springtime tours on the weekend of March 14, when the pandemic news spread to the point of shutting down concert venues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Arsenal are reported to be keen on a deal to sign German international Jon Tah this summer, but the worldwide pandemic is claimed to be a large stumbling block over the move.                                                                                                                                                                                  Tah has a minimum fee release clause in his current deal which can be triggered for a reported £35 Million, but that fee has an expiry date of May 31, which stems the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                  Arsenal’s current Premier League season, much-like a number of other countries top tiers, has been suspended indefinitely following the outbreak of COVID-19 all over the globe. This not only means that football cannot be played for the foreseeable future, but the pause button has also been hit on club’s financial situations also, and that is before taking into consideration the earnings from our respective league or European finishing places.                                                                                                                                                                                  The later that sanctions are lifted, the more and more likely that it will be that European club football will be scrapped altogether for the current season, which may well have been Arsenal’s best chance at qualifying for the elite club competition the Champions League, which is a big boost to club’s finances.                                                                                                                                                                                  We of course are still in the running to finish in the CL places in our division, but even if the league was able to restart today, completing all the fixtures by May 31 would have been unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                  Should the club rate Tah as a priority signing, they could well trigger his clause before the deadline, and get the deal over the line ahead of next season, but I personally cannot see our club designating any of the summer transfer budget until they know exactly where they stand at the end of the current campaign, whenever that will be.                                                                                                                                                                                  Could Arsenal rate the 24 year-old as a priority signing? Will a large number of clubs endure a minimal summer of spending following the pandemic?

The next day, Sawicki traveled to Bradford.                                                                                                                                                                                  “The next day, I was in Bradford and basically had a visit with Coach Foster, sat down with him and talked out my options and made my decision on the spot to transfer for that spring,” Sawicki said.                                                                                                                                                                                  He made the most out of a disappointing surprise. Now, Sawicki is doing the same with the premature ending to his college baseball career. Like all spring college athletes, Sawicki’s season ended abruptly last month amid the escalating concerns over the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                  Sawicki said Foster taught him how to deal with a fear of failure early on after arriving at UPB.                                                                                                                                                                                  “The first day I met him, he asked me what my biggest fear was and I had an extensive talk with him and I said, ‘honestly it’s failure, my biggest fear is letting the guys beside me down, letting my coaches down’ and that was the biggest thing I had to learn because baseball is a game of failure,” Sawicki said. “The best players in the world only get a hit three times out of 10. If you can do that you’re in the hall of fame in the majors. Knowing that I’m going to fail, but using failure as motivation to step my game up and become better every day.”

Apple's small phone-loving fans can now tick off an item that has been on their wishlist for years -- the iPhone SE 2020. Starting at $399, Apple has positioned the iPhone SE as a "budget phone," and is now the most affordable iPhone you can buy. At this price, Apple hopes to lure budget-minded customers who aren't willing to splurge $1,000 or even $700 (on say, an iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11) to a new iPhone.                                                                                                                                                                                   The next generation iPhone SE retains many of the features people have come to know and love about the original iPhone SE such as a physical home button and a compact size. Although the newer iPhone SE is slightly larger at 4.7 inches (compared to the original iPhone SE's 4-inch screen), it's still considered a small handset by today's standards.                                                                                                                                                                                  Apple released the original iPhone SE in 2016 and featured the same A9 processor as the iPhone 6S (Apple's flagship at the time), before it was discontinued in favor of the iPhone 8. For more on how the brand new iPhone SE stacks up against its predecessor and the pricier iPhone XR and iPhone 11, check out CNET's specs chart below.

"The song basically breaks down the whole process of spending every day with someone, growing apart and moving on, and then somehow being brought back together," Orlando tells _Billboard_, adding that the song is about "reconnection."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe was full of praise for Callum Wilson after the striker's hat-trick helped secure an historic 4-3 win for the south-coast club at West Ham.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The visitors' first Premier League victory was also their first over West Ham and came off the back of two defeats at the hands of Aston Villa and Liverpool in which they failed to score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wilson punished two defensive lapses as Bournemouth led 2-0 at the break at Upton Park, but West Ham hit back with two goals in the space of four minutes at the start of the second half from Mark Noble and Cheikhou Kouyate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Marc Pugh, however, put Bournemouth back in front before Wilson made it 4-2 from the penalty spot, rendering Modibo Maiga's late reply for the hosts nothing more than a consolation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And the former Coventry striker's three-goal haul left Howe delighted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "I don't mind singling Callum out on the back of a hat-trick," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "I thought he was a real menace with his pace, his energy and his movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "The first goal was an excellent finish from a really difficult chance and from that moment, I felt that we had the belief to win the game.

"To score his first Premier League goals and a hat-trick means it's a very special game for him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Callum is a huge part of what we are doing at the moment and I'm delighted with him."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Howe went on to emphasise just how much their maiden top-flight victory will boost his players' confidence levels.

"It was so important, it means everything to get our first win.

The United Kingdom has said that the idea that the virus, which has turned into a true global pandemic, has leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan “is no longer to be ruled out.” A member of the emergency committee of senior government officials said on Sunday that “there is a credible alternative view based on the nature of the virus. It may not be a coincidence that there is a laboratory in Wuhan. “                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

The Foreign Minister stressed that the EU was a peace project and that it must continue to do so. “There is no reason to have children on the rubbish dumps of the islands in Greece.” In addition to Luxembourg and Germany, there are other countries that have agreed to accept minors. He was optimistic that other countries would follow, said the social democrat. Now is the time to “get to grips with the misery on the islands” and to transfer people to the mainland. “But it is only possible if the political will is there to see that these are people.”

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The first tentative steps in lifting the economically crippling coronavirus restrictions in Europe and China are running into resistance, with shoppers and other customers staying away from the reopened businesses and workers afraid the newly restored freedoms could put their health at risk.

There are, however, definite downsides to not being as proactive as possible in the current situation. One is that we do not gain the advantage of better coordination of individual country responses – and in this crisis, we need all the advantages we can get. A longer-term danger is that if the secretary-general’s personal “good offices” are not employed proactively when the need is as clear and vital as it is now, then the prestige and power of both the facility and the office is sure to be damaged and erode further. Perhaps most importantly, in times of international deadlock, the tendency is not even to attempt such initiatives, because they are considered unlikely to succeed. If we fall into this trap, how do we ever get to a future where the international community is once again characterized by the quest to improve the global common good, and not just to accept the negative inertia of national authoritarianism?

On April 12, 2020, Melinda Gates, wife of Microsoft billionaire, Bill Gates, and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, made a stark forecast about the fate of Africa in the age of the coronavirus global pandemic, suggesting that the African continent is set to suffer great consequences if the pandemic reaches a peak there in similar ways like in Europe, America and Asia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In her interview with CNN, she referred to reports of dead bodies in Ecuador and added that “you are going to see that in Africa.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   She cited weak healthcare systems, poverty and slum dwelling, difficulty of enforcing physical distancing and lack of clean water as the reasons why Africa is essentially sitting on a disaster the continent will surely be incapable of dealing with if the virus takes hold here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Many Africans on the internet were rattled by Gates’ projections and were thrown anew into intense debates that had been going on around the factors underpinning the inexplicably low Covid-19 case numbers all across the continent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The mindset among many African ‘netizens’, it seems to me, is that these low numbers are what they are, that Africa is where it is with regards to the impact of the pandemic and no reason for anyone without evidence to issue such doomsday warnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In fact, some of the reactions to Mrs Gates’ predictions saw her as wishing the continent ill. “Back to sender, their evil thoughts for Africa won’t manifest,” commented one and “No evil plan from the Gates family shall come to pass over Africa,” said another, just to cite a couple.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Hell yes I am. You ever been to Austin in the summer? It's hot.

JOHNSEN, Roger Clark Scientist, Audiophile, Writer Roger Clark Johnsen, beloved son of Arthur M. and Wilda G. Johnsen (both now deceased) and cherished by his many friends, died peacefully on April 8 while in Hospice care in Cambridge, Massachusetts after a series of skirmishes with cancer. Coming to Harvard College from Sioux City, Iowa, he became a lifelong Boston resident. Clark never married and ruefully referred to himself as an "unconfirmed bachelor." At Harvard College he studied science, did some acting, and joined the college radio station WHRB, a commercial FM radio station serving the Greater Boston area. Clark was a classical music announcer for the station and an on-air presence and trainer of other announcers through the early 1960s. After graduation he was employed at Itek Corporation in Lexington, Massachusetts, where he researched holography in its early years, then worked on projects such as the Apollo Moon Mapper, the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, the super-secret Corona Project, and the Viking Mars Lander Camera as systems engineer. One of the highlights of his life was the time he gave a presentation to the major Lander contractors to NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and found himself invited to stay afterwards for dinner to discuss details with the lead scientists. He established and for twenty years operated The Listening Studio in Boston, dedicated to researching sound reproduction in the systematic mode of a NASA project. He was awarded complimentary Life Membership in the Audio Engineering Society. His other interests included music, both classical and traditional; audio technology and record collecting; literature, both fiction and non-fiction; finish carpentry; and writing - short stories and poems (all left unpublished). He authored twenty years of occasional magazine columns on audio and musical topics, and one published book, The Wood Effect: Unaccounted Contributor to Error and Confusion in Acoustics and Audio. He enjoyed travel, getting to Europe twice in his first thirty years, afterwards mostly to Florida and California, where he visited many friends and enjoyed the outdoors, as well as visits with friends and family in Nebraska. Good food, beer, and fine wine were always on the menu wherever he lived or went. His analytical intelligence and (hard-won) outgoingness will be missed by his friends, associates, and family. A private service and interment will take place at a later date at his family's burial plot in Laurel, Nebraska.

If Staveley's name is familiar to Liverpool fans, it's because the businesswoman could have actually ended the reign of Hicks and Gillett after just one year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Back in 2008, Liverpool were in the first full season of the Hicks and Gillett era, with the Americans having taken over the club in February the previous year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, the owners weren’t universally popular with Reds fans to say the least, and when Staveley fronted a bid for the club involving Dubai International Capital, it garnered some support. Indeed a fan banner at Liverpool’s league game against West Ham United declared “We want one DIC not two”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The interest came after DIC had first  _reportedly been in the mix_  before Hicks & Gillett completed their takeover in 2007, and Staveley revealed at the time that an agreement for Gillett to sell his stake and DIC to co-own the club with Hicks had been close.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

But entering the fall of that year, two weeks before arriving on campus, Sawicki learned the coaches who recruited him were out at Clarion, and he would have to try out for his spot on the team.                                                                                                                                                                                  “Going into that fall at Clarion, we didn’t have a coach and we all showed up and there were actually 60 guys at Clarion for baseball,” Sawicki said. “Thinking I was recruited, I thought it didn’t matter for me. But after going through that process, I was actually the last person (left out) … they had to knock the roster down to 29 and I was basically No. 30.”

"Maybe there's a positive takeaway?" he ponders. "I've had this struggle of this is 'how I should be in my life,' and now when push comes to shove, it shows how yeah, you have something you were passionate about, and you put a lot of time into it. Even if the world's ending, you can still find a way through and wake up in very, very high spirits every day.

Diego Fabbrini and Kike were influential as Middlesbrough beat Bolton Wanderers in the Championship, while Carlisle United and Cambridge United played out an eight-goal thriller in League Two.                                                                                                                                                                                  Aitor Karanka's Middlesbrough, losing play-off finalists last season, picked up their first league win of the campaign at the Riverside Stadium in a 3-0 triumph that saw David Nugent make his debut.                                                                                                                                                                                  All of their goals came in the first half, with Fabbrini opening the scoring with a fierce 25-yard effort before twice setting up Kike.                                                                                                                                                                                  Brighton and Hove Albion made it two wins from two as Tomer Hemed's 90th-minute penalty secured a 2-1 success at Fulham.                                                                                                                                                                                  Relegated QPR remain winless after surrendering a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 against Cardiff City at Loftus Road, while Ipswich Town came from behind to see off Sheffield Wednesday 2-1, and Nottingham Forest matched that feat against Rotherham United.                                                                                                                                                                                  Bristol City were left to rue a Luke Freeman red card as they let a 2-1 lead slip in a 4-2 defeat at home to Brentford, while Preston North End won 1-0 at fellow league newcomers Milton Keynes Dons despite playing the last seven minutes with 10 men.

Carlisle fought back from a losing position three times with Jabo Ibehre grabbing a hat-trick, as Barry Corr netted twice for the visitors.

Turmoil in financial markets created some profitable opportunities for large banks in the first quarter, but results released Wednesday underscored the industry's expectations for a potentially deep US recession.
 Trading divisions at large banks garnered boom-like revenue jumps as turmoil in financial markets prompted more transactions of equities and bonds.
 But Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs each set aside large sums of money in case of bad loans, significantly denting profits and reflecting expectations for potentially major defaults in a slowing US economy amid deep uncertainty over how long the coronavirus shutdowns will last.
 The measures follow similar announcements Tuesday from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as executives warned of a potentially deep recession that could keep growth weak for the foreseeable future.
 Citigroup has been testing its loan book against a wide array of economic scenarios, including ones where unemployment reaches 15 percent and US growth contracts by as much as 40 percent, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason.
 "We would imagine those would be severe-type scenarios," Mason told reporters on a conference call, "but we're in touch across our firm to make sure we can manage that."
 Mason said the bank's credit card business saw a decline of 30 percent in sales at the end of the March and "we've continued to see that pressure play through in April."
 Citigroup set aside around $7 billion in the first quarter in case of defaults, leading to a 46 percent drop in profits to $2.5 billion. Revenues rose 12 percent to $20.7 billion.
 Mason said the bank could delay some spending, such as marketing for credit cards, depending on how conditions evolve.
 Bank of America, the biggest US bank by assets after JPMorgan Chase, set aside $4.8 billion for potential defaults, $3.6 billion of which was added in the first quarter.
 Bank of America reported quarterly profits of $3.5 billion, down 48.4 percent from the year-ago period.
 \- Feast or famine -
 Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs reported profits of $1.1 billion, down 49 percent from the year-ago period. Revenues dipped one percent to $8.7 billion.
 Goldman set aside $937 million during the quarter to deal with potential defaults, citing "continued pressure in the energy sector and the impact of the Covid-19 on the broader economic environment."
 The shock from the coronavirus crisis had a feast-or-famine impact of many of Goldman's divisions.
 On the positive side, the firm enjoyed double-digit revenue boosts to fixed income and equity trading, and won the bank "significantly higher" revenue in corporate lending and underwriting.
 But Goldman suffered an operating loss in its asset management business due to losses in equity and debt investments. The firm also saw a big drop in revenues tied to financial advising for corporate mergers.
 Shares of Citigroup fell 4.3 percent to $43.42 and Bank of America tumbled 6.0 percent to $22.30, while Goldman Sachs shed 2.4 percent to $173.90.

Edin Dzeko marked his first appearance for Roma with a brace in an enthralling 6-4 friendly victory over Sevilla on Friday.
 Bosnia-Herzegovina striker Dzeko, who joined the Serie A club from Manchester City earlier this week, netted twice in the first half at Stadio Olimpico.
 His goals helped Roma on their way to a 6-0 lead, but Sevilla once again showed their fighting qualities to threaten what would have been a remarkable comeback.
 Unai Emery's men trailed Barcelona 4-1 in Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup before pulling it back to 4-4 and eventually losing in extra-time.
 The Liga side were up against it again, Dzeko opening the scoring with a thumping near-post shot in the fourth minute and the striker rounding off a wonderful team move to make it 3-0 shortly before the break, after Vasilis Torosidis had also scored.
 Dzeko turned provider for Radja Nainggolan to make it 4-0 on the stroke of half-time, before transfer-window recruit Mohamed Salah got in on the act in the second half and veteran captain Francesco Totti added a sixth from the penalty spot in the 63rd minute.
 Denis Suarez completed a fine solo effort for what appeared a scant consolation with 20 minutes remaining, but Jose Antonio Reyes – scorer against Barca – further reduced the deficit when he side-footed in Kevin Gameiro's assist.
 Suarez was proving a menace and he set up Coke for Sevilla's third, before scoring his second four minutes from time.
 The comeback proved too little too late, though, as Roma held on for the win.

Organizations need to continually evaluate their existing cybersecurity defenses in light of the Tenets of Zero Trust in order to continually improve their security postures. The NIST standard underscores the importance of how security architecture matters. For example, defenses to protect assets need to be as close to the asset as possible, much like in a war. In this new era of cyberwarfare, soldiers will need their own body armor and tools to defend against an adversary. Similarly, it is important to arm each server with appropriate defenses to protect against cyberthreats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           *[FT]: Financial Times

_PUBG_ Season 7 is now live on the game's test servers ahead of its official launch on Tuesday, April 21, and its headlining feature is a revamped version of the Vikendi map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Vikendi was removed from PUBG's map rotation a few months ago following player feedback, and PUBG Corp. has made several changes to map in response to that feedback. For starters, several areas have been removed, expanded, or relocated. Dinopark is now the much larger Dinoland, the Abbey has been moved to Mount Kreznik, more cover was added to the town of Volnova, while Tovar and Movatra have been removed outright. The southern half of the island also has less snow on it in order to improve visibility, and snowbikes and snowmobiles have been replaced with standard motorcycles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The single biggest change to Vikendi comes in the form of a railway system which criss-crosses over the entire map. There are 12 train stations with nine engines between them, and you can ride these trains to get to other areas much faster. You can also be shot while riding trains, or get run over _by_ trains, so be careful. This is the first true quick-travel system in PUBG, and like vehicles, it ought to create interesting points of conflict while giving players more ways to get around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Outside of Vikendi, PUBG Season 7 is bringing the Cold Front Survivor Pass, which has new challenges to complete and cosmetics to unlock. This season will also see community missions, seasonal missions spread across the next three months, and progression missions that give big boosts of XP. Oh, and there's also a new weapon! Kind of, anyway. The new Mosin-Nagant rifle is technically new, but it's really just a Kar98k with a new sound effect and body.

The scientific director of Italy's leading infectious disease hospital says he'd like to hire Dr. Anthony Fauci should President Donald Trump remove him from the White House coronavirus task force. Dr Giuseppe Ippolito of Rome's Lazzaro Spallanzani hospital wrote a letter released Wednesday to the Italian president and other officials, saying Italy should welcome Fauci with open arms. The country is the European epicenter of the pandemic, and Spallanzani treated Italy's first patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Appie, how everybody in the club called him, was just 18 years old when I came to Ajax. Almost still a child. But at Ajax it’s not like the youth players have to freeze in awe of anything or anybody. Least of all those youth players who were making their way to the first team back then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Roma can expect goals from Edin Dzeko, according to the Bosnian, who is eyeing trophies after completing a season-long loan move to the Stadio Olimpico.
 Dzeko will spend the 2015-16 campaign in the Italian capital after bringing a four-and-a-half-year association with Manchester City to an end on Wednesday.
 Roma have finished second in Serie A in each of the last two seasons, also reaching the latter stages of the Coppa Italia, but Dzeko believes he could be key to helping them improve further.
 "I came here to win titles with Roma," he told the club's official website.
 "Hopefully we will win many, many trophies but first we have to work hard on the pitch and at the end, hopefully we will get where we want to be.
 "I can only promise one thing and that is that I will give my best for this club in every game.
 "I'll bring goals to this team. I think that's what every team needs and that's what I do the best.
 "I will try to do my job in the future here and hopefully score a lot of goals for AS Roma.
 "I never talk about personal targets. I think the first thing and the most important thing is that AS Roma have a lot of success and win each game.
 "If I score the goals it's better for me but first of all, it's about the team.
 "I know Mohamed Salah, even from Basel, and I remember when he played against the English team and scored a few goals.
 "I think his last year at Fiorentina was a great season for him and I think Roma can be happy to have a player like him here. Hopefully he can bring some more quality to this team."
 Dzeko scored 50 goals in 130 Premier League appearances for City, while he also has 42 in 72 matches for Bosnia.

Despite Manchester City's flying start to the Premier League season, Manuel Pellegrini believes it will be tough for his side to take all three points at Everton on Sunday.                                                  Pellegrini's men have laid down an early marker as they seek to regain the Premier League title surrendered to Chelsea last season.                                                  City beat West Brom 3-0 in their first game of the season and then overcame Chelsea by the same scoreline last Sunday.                                                  Everton were held to a 2-2 draw by newly promoted Watford in their opening match but produced an impressive counter-attacking performance at Southampton to claim a 3-0 win last time out.                                                  And, with similar tactics likely on Roberto Martinez's mind, Pellegrini is under no illusions as to the task City will face on Merseyside.                                                  "It will be a difficult challenge, they are a difficult team who play very good football," Pellegrini said.                                                  "They didn't play well against Watford but scored two goals, and in their second game they played very well and scored three goals.                                                  "We must be very concentrated and play with a lot of intensity to win there. They try to have good possession of the ball, I'm sure we will see a similar Everton as to previous seasons."                                                  New signing Nicolas Otamendi will not start but is available following his switch from Valencia, but fellow Argentine Pablo Zabaleta is out for up to a month due to a knee injury.                                                  Fabian Delph and Gael Clichy have both returned to training for City, and Fernando is available for selection after shaking off a groin issue.                                                  Everton have been boosted by Aiden McGeady's recovery from a hamstring problem.                                                  However, Steven Pienaar (hamstring), Darron Gibson (foot), Tony Hibbert (knee) and Leighton Baines (ankle) are all still out of action.                                                  Martinez credited a fine team showing after overseeing success at Southampton, rather than Romelu Lukaku's double, and feels a similarly well-rounded display will be needed against City.                                                  "When you perform as a team, you are always going to see certain individuals with enormous talent shining," Martinez said. "But the key is to perform well as a team.                                                  "It is the same with Sunday – if we rely on one or two individuals, we are going to fall short. Against City it will be the same as Southampton. We will have to be very good in everything.                                                  "If you are not very strong throughout every aspect of the performance, you will find playing against Manchester City very tough."

Don’t take for granted they will work.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking denied his team were distracted by ongoing transfer speculation surrounding Kevin De Bruyne but conceded he was "not satisfied" with their draw at Cologne.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Substitute Nicklas Bendtner saved Hecking's men at the RheinEnergieStadion, with the Danish striker tapping the ball over the line in the 83rd minute to secure a 1-1 draw on Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Cologne had led at half-time through Simon Zoller's goal on the half-hour mark and Hecking claimed Wolfsburg had been poor for at least the first hour, although he praised their ability to earn a result, as Daniel Caligiuri and Bendtner combined to produce an equaliser after both started on the bench.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Caligiuri found space for a shot after a long throw by Wolfsburg and his effort was parried into the path of Bendtner, who made no mistake from a yard out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "That was not a good game on our behalf. Our display over 60 minutes was uninspired and had very little to do with tempo football," Hecking said at his post-match news conference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "That was the case for a period against Frankfurt and it was even more noticeable here today. We need to turn things around very quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "After an hour we got a better grip on proceedings and then we got our goal. That is one of my team's strengths. On the whole though, I am not satisfied."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  With De Bruyne expected to join Manchester City before the end of the transfer window, some reporters suggested to Hecking that Wolfsburg were struggling to focus with the Belgian playmaker's future still uncertain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Hecking was not convinced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "I don't see how that is affecting us. You cannot blame a bad game only on one player. So I do not see a correlation," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

There is little downside for Secretary-General Guterres to employ his good offices to the fullest in this situation. If his best efforts to ignite a greater global response fails, we will be no worse off than if nothing had been attempted _._ But if he succeeds in increasing coordination even a little, the upside goes well beyond just being able to deal more effectively against COVID-19 and its economic and social consequences. Reminding the international community what successful cooperation can achieve may also kick-start reversing the trend of today’s dismal level of international cooperation.

Roma will attack Juventus from the outset on Sunday as they look to take valuable early points from their Serie A title rivals, says Rudi Garcia.                                                                                                                                                                                          Garcia's men have failed to beat defending champions Juve in their past four league matches, but go into Sunday's clash at the Stadio Olimpico with renewed hope after strengthening their squad.                                                                                                                                                                                          Edin Dzeko, Mohamed Salah and Lucas Digne – who is unlikely to start – are just three of Garcia's acquisitions ahead of the transfer deadline and the head coach expects to see a hungrier Roma take the game to Juventus.                                                                                                                                                                                          "I want to see more intensity to our play than at Verona, similar to what we saw at the end of that game," he said. "We have to play as if we're chasing the game from the start tomorrow and play aggressively from the off to win.                                                                                                                                                                                          "It is a massive game – the sort we all like to be involved in. It's strange to be playing it in just the second week. We must play to win and make home advantage count for us.

Selling is all about your ability to connect with the struggle someone is experiencing, what’s really keeping them up at night, and help them find solutions. Great sales is all about communicating with your potential on the level of their emotional needs and dreams, rather than offering gimmicks or false claims.  When you have a solution to their problem, you are helping, not selling.

Carefully and selectively used in the past, the power of quiet diplomacy has had success in bringing members of the international community together. A global pandemic and its looming dire economic repercussions are exactly the kind of emergency that, with international cooperation being at a low point, necessitates the use of “good offices.” Quiet diplomacy goes beyond the many interventions already made by Secretary-General Guterres in this crisis. Pointing out the dysfunctionality in the international community, calling for the cessation of all conflict, urging greater cooperation -- especially with regard to the most vulnerable among us -- and presenting a socio-economic call for action are important markers that the Secretary-General is using to indicate where the international community should be focusing. But we of course do not see “behind the scenes” to know what else Secretary-General Guterres is doing. Where even now his quiet diplomacy may be practiced aggressively.

Despite relatively limited redemptions in February, both the banking and corporate sectors attained low rollover ratios in new borrowing at 69% and 65%, leading to a total $0.7bn outflow (including short-term loans).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

He also vowed to continue fighting for progressive priorities such as his signature "Medicare for All" as a senator, even though Biden has refused to embrace the government-backed single-payer health care system.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "If people want to vote for me, we'd appreciate it," Sanders said of the roughly 20 primary contests that remain where his name will appear on the ballot. He later added, "I think you're going to see significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign into a more progressive direction on a whole lot of issues."                                                                                                                                                                                                  Sanders did not outline any specific plans to begin helping Biden in earnest, though he noted that he held dozens of rallies for former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton four years ago and would be at least as active for Biden. In the short term, he said he's essentially "incarcerated in his home" because of coronavirus social distancing guidelines and did not know when he would return to the campaign trail.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Sanders brushed away questions about why he was willing to back Biden so much sooner than he did Clinton, whom he waited until June to endorse. He said recent conversations with former President Barack Obama did not influence his decision. It came down to simple math, he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                  In 2016, Sanders said he had a mathematical path to the nomination all the way until the California primary, which was held on the last day of voting in June. That simply wasn't the case this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "What would be the sense of staying in, of spending a whole lot of money, of attacking the vice president, giving fodder for Trump -- what's the sense of doing that when you can't win?" he asked.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "I will do everything I can to help elect Joe," Sanders continued. "We had a contentious campaign. We disagree on issues. But my job now is to not only rally my supporters, but to do everything I can to bring the party together to see that (Trump) is not elected president."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Curtis was born on April 11, 1944 in Des Moines, IA. He graduated from DMACC with a degree in Criminal Justice. His career in law enforcement spanned over 30 years serving Waukee, Adel and Dallas County. After his retirement, Curtis continued to serve as a security guard for the State Capital in Des Moines and as a member of the Waukee City Council for a number of years.                                                                                                                                                                                      Curtis had a great love of life and family. He was an avid NASCAR fan and a Trekkie. He loved to travel and see new places, especially his yearly trips to Branson, MO; which started out as family reunions, but ended up being one of his favorite places to visit. Curtis also opened his home as a foster parent and hosted several foreign exchange students from Japan over the years.

Abas said he decided to build an e-commerce platform based on hashtags because “the hashtag is an incredibly elegant solution to indexing enormous amounts of information.

Tyler Ray Hiatt, 24, of Chillicothe passed away unexpectedly on Monday, April 13, 2020 at his home.

It has been a debate that has split football fans the world over for years and the arguments will resurface when Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo feature in La Liga's opening weekend.                                                                                                                                                                                          Players, pundits, supporters and team-mates have all waded in to have their say on who is the world's best player, Barcelona star Messi or Real Madrid hero Ronaldo.                                                                                                                                                                                          While a definitive answer is unlikely to ever be given on that front, one certainty is that both phenomenal talents will be the driving forces behind Barca and Real's quest for domestic and European glory again this season.                                                                                                                                                                                          On an individual basis, the pair have won the last seven FIFA Ballons d'Or with Messi's four to Ronaldo's three, although the latter has collected the last two.                                                                                                                                                                                          Most would consider Messi the favourite to win the award this time around, though, after the Argentina international enjoyed an unbelievable year to help Barca to a Liga, Copa del Rey and UEFA Champions League treble.                                                                                                                                                                                          Messi rebounded from an injury-disrupted 2013-14 campaign in which he scored "only" 28 league goals to be the driving force behind the club's success.                                                                                                                                                                                          He scored an impressive 58 goals in all competitions, but Messi was undoubtedly helped by the weight of expectation being shared with Luis Suarez and Neymar - the trio scoring 122 times, a record in Spanish football, and their understanding is again key for the Catalans this season.                                                                                                                                                                                          Messi put an early season falling out with Luis Enrique to one side to score 35 of his goals after the turn of the year, but also showed that there is more to his genius than just his goalscoring prowess.                                                                                                                                                                                          He provided 18 assists in La Liga as well as creating 95 chances for his team-mates, and there is nothing to suggest that he cannot match, or even better, those statistics this time around.                                                                                                                                                                                          The task for Ronaldo will be to spearhead a Real side hurting from watching their great rivals steal the limelight last term and reclaiming the Copa and Champions League titles the capital club won in 2014.                                                                                                                                                                                          The Portugal star has had to face up to a belief in some quarters that his star is on the wane, a claim that looks absurd against a staggering 48 league goals last term.                                                                                                                                                                                          Ronaldo's critics would suggest that his goal return is a sign of his selfish style of play, but the former Manchester United forward's assists (16) and chances created (75) were statistically his best in the last five seasons - including the last time Real won the title in 2011-12 - going some way to dispelling that myth.                                                                                                                                                                                          An important factor for Ronaldo, and Real, is his relationship with new head coach Rafael Benitez.                                                                                                                                                                                          The Spanish press seized upon Ronaldo seemingly reacting angrily to Benitez in training last month, sparking rumours of a rift with the former Liverpool boss.                                                                                                                                                                                          Outwardly, Benitez laughed off any suggestions of a falling out with his star man, but the vultures are sure to circle if Ronaldo has a dip in form.                                                                                                                                                                                          Another key component will be the cohesion of Real's front three, and Ronaldo will need Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema to help share the burden this season.                                                                                                                                                                                          Bale (13) and Benzema (15) scored 28 league goals between them last term, with the former facing fierce criticism from the media and fans alike during an underwhelming second season in Spain.                                                                                                                                                                                          Injuries to creative sparks Luka Modric and James Rodriguez perhaps goes someway to explaining why the three did not always appear to be on the same page.                                                                                                                                                                                          But if Real are to challenge Barca, and Ronaldo is to outshine Messi, then striking a balance for the trio is crucial.                                                                                                                                                                                          Barcelona or Real Madrid will win the league - it would take a brave man to bet against that. Who finishes top could well come down to the victor in the latest chapter of the battle between the finest two players of a generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

During a news conference in China, authorities also cautioned that the studies must be done properly.                                                                                                                                                                                          “Although we are in an emergency, we cannot lower the standards of safety and effectiveness in the reviews of vaccines,” said Wang Junzhi, a Chinese biopharmaceutical expert. “The public is paying huge attention.”                                                                                                                                                                                          The World Health Organization this week counted more than five dozen other vaccine candidates in earlier stages of development being pursued around the world.

Peonies are one of the most majestic flowers that I grow. Their beautiful blossoms are impressive and are fabulous additions to any garden. The flowers are elegant, the plants are long-lived and, when not in bloom, the bushes have foliage that looks pretty and graceful in the garden.                                                                                                                                                                                      The range of colors can be dark, rich rose to light pink; bright yellow to creamy white and colors in-between. Some have a fragrance that ranges from sweet and rosy to citrusy and spicy. Peonies also have a wide range of shapes, from simple, elegant singles to massive double blossoms with hundreds of petals. With all of their wonderful traits, some can argue that they are the queen of the springtime garden.                                                                                                                                                                                      It is estimated that there are 33 different species of peonies. Herbaceous, tree peonies and intersectional are the three that I grow and these have done well for me with little care. By growing more than one species, I have a great parade of spring flowers that bloom over a good month.                                                                                                                                                                                      This parade of blooms starts with my tree peonies. These are the peonies that are the ones you often see in Chinese paintings with their iridescent large blooms. The flowers bloom on short stems that are on a bush that grows between 3 to 7 feet tall. Since the blooms form on old wood, they are not to be cut down in the fall like some other peonies. They are slow-growing, deer resistant and one mature plant can produce up to 50 blooms.                                                                                                                                                                                      Next to bloom are my herbaceous peonies that are a perennial plant that dies back to the ground each year. These are the most popular and they have been hybridized for a long time. There are so many different varieties of them and these are the most readily available.                                                                                                                                                                                      Herbaceous peonies are usually what come to mind when you are talking about peonies. The roots remain dormant under the soil, and then the plant stems push up in the spring and they bloom about a month later. When reading about the different varieties, the descriptions usually specify if they are early, midseason or late-season bloomers. Where I live, I have to plant the varieties that bloom early because it gets too hot in zone 7 to grow the later blooming ones. People who live in colder climates can grow peonies that bloom on into June.                                                                                                                                                                                      The third species that I grow is the intersectional, a category of hybrids created by crossing herbaceous and tree peonies. These peonies look like herbaceous peonies that are on steroids. They go dormant to the ground in winter like the herbaceous peonies and have larger flowers like the tree peonies. They have not been around as long as herbaceous or tree peonies and are now becoming quite popular.                                                                                                                                                                                      Peonies require a period of cold weather in order to bloom and, for this reason, peonies are planted close to the surface of the soil. In cooler climates, they can be as deep as 3 inches but in warmer areas, they can be as little as an inch deep. They need a chilling period to attain dormancy and set the buds and being closer to the surface helps obtain this.                                                                                                                                                                                      Peonies are best planted in the fall, about six weeks before the ground freezes. Most peonies are sold as bare roots so it is good to get them planted in time to let the roots get established before winter comes calling. Plant them in rich, loamy, well-drained soil. Now, depending on where you live will determine how much sun they need. In the sunny South, morning sun and afternoon shade are best and in colder climates, the more sun peonies require.                                                                                                                                                                                      Peonies like to have a pH of around 6.5. I use wood ash to naturally modify my acidic soil and to add nutrients. If you do not have wood ashes, lime can be applied to the soil to bring the correct pH, applying it every three to four years. A light application of compost mixed with a small amount of fertilizer can be added to the surrounding soil after the flowers finish blooming.                                                                                                                                                                                      Peonies are best propagated by lifting and dividing the root clump, in the fall. You can cut the clump, leaving two to three eyes (or buds) with each division. It is also best to replant them soon after the cuts are made. Sometimes peonies do best if divided after 10 to 20 years but I have seen plants that bloom profusely that were planted well over 50 years ago.                                                                                           Peonies are a classic garden plant that can thrive for decades with minimal care when they are in the right location and when the soil requirements are met. It is important to do the initial planting correctly so that your plants will outlive you. And remember, patience is key to growing peonies since it might take them a year or two to get established and bloom profusely. You are establishing a long-term relationship so get it started on the right footing and enjoy these majestic flowers.

Players and coaches at Parma have agreed to forego one month's wages to help the Italian side through the stoppage caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the club said on Wednesday, Parma became the third Serie A team to agree wage cuts with the players after titleholders Juventus, where salaries will be reduced during a four-month period, and Cagliari, whose squad accepted going without pay in March.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and it is still not clear if or when the season will re-start. Parma said the agreement was made unanimously "in light of the health emergency that is preventing the performance of sports activities and already causing considerable economic damage to the club."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Parma thanked their staff "for the sense of responsibility shown in this difficult moment which requires good sense and constructive spirit on the part of all company members." The club added that it was waiting to find out "whether or not the health conditions of the country will allow a resumption of competitive activities in this season."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Last week, the Serie A league recommended that clubs impose wage cuts of between two and four months’ pay on playing staff to help them through the crisis, although it was left up to each club to implement the measure. The players' union said the proposal was inadmissible and the situation has since reached an impasse.

Elle chewed her bottom lip for a moment. Without fail, chaos reigned over her schedule the closer they approached opening day but it was nothing she couldn't handle. She hastily sent off several replies as well as her promised ETA when the door's bell signaled more business for the shop. But it was the loud rumble of laughter which caused her blood to freeze.                                                                                                                                                                                               *[FT]: Financial Times

PROCESS DIDN'T TRUMP PREFERENCE                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wisconsin Republicans were long wary of holding the Supreme Court election on the same day as a competitive presidential primary, mindful the high-profile presidential race would drive Democratic voters to the polls.                                                                                                                                                                                                          The results suggest they were right to worry — and the virus didn't change that.                                                                                                                                                                                                          About 900,000 people cast ballots in the Democratic presidential primary, compared to only 600,000 voting in the GOP one, where Trump was not challenged.                                                                                                                                                                                                          "What was obvious about yesterday? More Democrats showed up than Republicans. It's as simple as that," said longtime Wisconsin Republican strategist Brandon Scholz. "It's what they wanted all along, holding the (presidential) primary on the same day as the spring election."                                                                                                                                                                                                          There will be plenty of fighting about voting methods and rules ahead, but in most places it's difficult for those battles to overwhelm the broad dynamics in a race.                                                                                                                                                                                                          THE BATTLE FOR WISCONSIN RAGES ON                                                                                                                                                                                                          The broad dynamic in battleground Wisconsin is trench warfare. Since Trump eked out a win in the state in 2016, Democrats have made the state a symbol and cause unlike any other, organizing well beyond the urban and college town strongholds in hope of taking it back in November.                                                                                                                                                                                                          In 2018, Democrats unseated a Republican governor and re-elected Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin in a sweep of statewide offices. But Republicans held onto their majorities in the state Legislature and a year later the conservative candidate won the state Supreme Court race. Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden have been deadlocked in polls there for months and both sides expect it to be close.                                                                                                                                                                                                          Democrats were quick to declare last week's election a strong indicator in their favor.                                                                                                                                                                                                          "The results this morning show that key elements of the Republican coalition are fraying," said David Bergenstein, a spokesman with the Democratic National Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                          They pointed to Democrats' strong turnout in Republican bastions in suburban Milwaukee and Green Bay, part of the migration of college-educated voters from Trump. Karofsky, the liberal Supreme Court candidate, won 28 counties, more than twice as many as Hillary Clinton did against Trump in 2016.                                                                                                                                                                                                          While Wisconsin's spring elections are often looked at as barometers for the fall, especially in presidential years, their effectiveness at predicting how voters will react come November is limited. Turnout is usually 50% or more higher in fall elections, making it foolish for Democrats to assume Karofsky's results will directly translate to the fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                          Wisconsin Republicans predicted they'd use the Supreme Court defeat as motivation for November.                                                                                                                                                                                                          "I think a lot of people, the fire is in the belly to work hard for the president and get it done," said state GOP chairman Andrew Hitt, comparing it to last year's successful effort to elect a conservative court candidate after Republican Gov. Scott Walker was defeated. "That's the fire."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

Italian bonds gave up all the gains they made since the European Central Bank launched an emergency stimulus programme to tackle the economic impact of coronavirus, as investor concerns about the lack of a coordinated euro zone response escalated further. The country's debt came under further pressure on Wednesday as disappointment with the Eurogroup's response package continued and the announcement of changes to the country's funding programme which increased the prospect of Rome adding to its debt pile.
 Euro zone finance ministers agreed a half-a-trillion euro plan to support coronavirus-hit economies last week. However, to the disappointment of several states led by Italy, the deal did not mention using joint debt to finance the economic recovery. Without joint debt issuance, coronavirus stimulus would only add to the debt of Southern European states, which has raised concern about debt sustainability, particularly in Italy.
 The gap with Germany's 10-year bond yield, effectively the risk premium Italy pays investors, rose as high as 240 bps , the highest since March 19, which was the day after the ECB unveiled its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, before which the premium had risen as high as 319 bps. It was last at around 230 bps. Italy's 2-year bond yield rose to as high as 1.15%, breaching the 1% level for the first time since the programme was announced. It was last up 16 basis points at 0.99% . 10-year yields were last up 7 bps at 1.86% after rising to nearly 2% earlier.
 "I'm surprised the ECB with PEPP and all the flexibility they have in this programme would allow spreads to widen that much over 200 basis points," said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING. "Either they haven't been intervening in the market this week... or the scale of the selling on the other hand is so big that ECB buying doesn't absorb this selling," he said, noting that data to show the ECB's purchases this week is not available yet.
 Italy will hold larger debt auctions and may resort to more costly syndicated placements for shorter-dated bonds as it ramps up spending to fight the health crisis, the Treasury said on Tuesday, although this was already largely priced in, analysts said. Other Southern European sovereigns have also come under pressure.
 The risk premium on Spain's 10-year bonds also rose nearly 30 bps over the last two sessions, also giving up gains since the PEPP programme announcement. "If we were to erase all those gains since the announcement of the PEPP that would be a very clear signal that the liquidity support promised by the ECB's beefed up QE program is no longer sufficient to offset concerns on a sovereignty front, on a debt metric front," said Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank.
 "To unwind all of those gains I think will trigger a notable further widening of the spread beyond that." Joint debt issuance is still a possible response, Eurogroup President Mario Centeno told Italy's Corriere della Sera daily.
 Higher-rated safe-haven yields edged lower as the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic kept global markets under pressure. Germany's 10-year benchmark fell 9 bps to a two week low at -0.46% In the primary market, Germany sold 0.82 billion euros in a top-up of its 30-year bund, seeing higher demand than the previous auction on March 18.
 Greece is set to sell 2 billion euros of seven-year bonds in its first sale since its debt became eligible for ECB purchases. Elsewhere, interbank borrowing costs continued to fall. The three-month Euribor fixing edged down to -0.250% in a further sign that the benchmark may be starting to respond to ECB measures aimed at easing the funding rush across the bloc.

The secretary-general’s more subtle powers, such as what has become known as “good offices” are interpreted, rather than explicit. They are rooted in Chapter XV, especially Articles 98 and 99 of the U.N. Charter. First defined and employed by the U.N.’s second secretary-general, Dag Hammarskjöld, and shaped by a number of his successors, “good offices” involves bringing to bear the prestige, credibility, and impartiality of this office, the weight of international public opinion embodied in the U.N., and especially the person of the Secretary-General, through the vehicle of quiet diplomacy.

Muthoot Fincrop will resume its operations in a limited manner by providing only money trasfer services for its customers. The company will be opening select branches across the country, only for money transfer services (MTSS), as per the directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India, it said in a release.
 Money transfer services are predominantly availed by the person who is dependent on the money sent by their close relatives. However, due to the lockdown, MTSS were affected, which has put people in great hardship. To resolve the issue, the RBI vide its communication dated April 13, 2020, has directed us to start providing MTSS services to the public, it said.
 "The economic impact of the lockdown necessitated because of the pandemic, on the common man, has been immense...the (RBI) direction will be comforting to the common man and enable Muthoot Fincorp in serving the needs of such common man," said Thomas John Muthoot, Chairman - Muthoot Pappachan Group and Managing Director - Muthoot Fincorp Limited. The company said it will open branches in phased manner, across the country, and select branches in Kerala, which has been able to control the impact of the pandemic admirably, from tomorrow, April 16.
 Select branches in rest of the country, will be opened from April 17, it added. The financial services provider said selection of branches is based on critical factors such as classification of the geographies in terms of the impact of pandemic and directions from local authorities.
 As per the directions of the authorities, complete adherence to the health and hygiene guidelines and protocol, both for the customers and the staff, are being put in place, it added..

"As a general rule of thumb, the more structurally similar (in terms of atomic crystal structure) the substrate and the film are to each other, the easier it is to achieve high material quality," he said. The better the quality, the better the LED's efficiency and performance. Sapphire is dissimilar structurally, and producing material without flaws and misalignments often requires complicated additional steps. Silicon carbide is not a perfect match, Zollner said, but it enables a high quality without the need for costly, additional methods.
