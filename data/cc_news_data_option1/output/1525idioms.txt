Despite the accolades, it’s possible that Douglas considers Adams to be a glorified box safety, i.e., one who doesn’t make enough plays on the ball. Adams only has two career interceptions. He also has 25 career pass breakups, including 12 in 2018. Interestingly, he has 12 career sacks, 6.5 last season when often was turned loose as a blitzer in new coordinator Gregg Williams’ scheme. He had two, including a 25-yard strip sack for a touchdown, in a virtuoso performance against the New York Giants.

Un'opera corale per emozionare e divertire, infondendo serenita e speranza e per veicolare un ringraziamento a tutti coloro che lavorano in prima linea per contrastare l'emergenza legata al Covid-19, a cominciare dal personale medico e sanitario. Ma anche un modo per dichiarare il proprio amore verso la citta, per esprimere gratitudine a tutti coloro che si sono impegnati rispettando le norme dettate dalla quarantena senza perdere coraggio e la serenita, ritratta nelle pillole domestiche inviate dai cittadini padovani e montate per l'occasione sopra una versione riarrangiata di "Ma quando torno a Padova" \- canzone per antonomasia della citta del Santo - di Umberto Marcato, che ha voluto regalare un esclusivo e breve cammeo.

Former Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas has raised £300,000 ($375,299, 345,288 euros) for Britain's National Health Service after a 36-hour indoor cycling stint.
 The Welshman rode a trio of 12-hour rides over three days on a turbo bike in the garage of his home in Cardiff in a bid to raise funds to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.
 The 12-hour rides were to emulate a typical shift of an NHS worker.
 "No exaggeration, the last two hours were the hardest I have ever had on the bike," Thomas told the BBC on Saturday.
 "I could barely sit down," the 2018 Tour de France champion added.
 Professional cycling, in common with all major sport worldwide, has been suspended following the spread of the virus, with this year's Tour de France delayed from June and July until August and September.
 The suspension of the road race calendar prompted Thomas to set himself a challenge which he likened to completing eight or nine stages of the Tour itself.
 "It has been solid," said Thomas, winner of the 2018 British sports personality of the year award.
 "I am going to have a week off to recover from this. It was 36 hours in the saddle over three days which would normally be a big training week for me.
 "The longest ride I have done on the road is eight hours and 20 minutes in a group and that was with a coffee stop.
 "On a turbo the longest was three hours and there is a lot of difference from that and riding outside where you have the scenery and downhill."
 The 33-year-old, a two-time Olympic pursuit gold medallist, added there were particularly personal as well as general fundraising reasons for his effort of endurance.
 "My mum's gone back to work at Velindre cancer hospital in Cardiff -- she's retired three times already and my best mate's a GP (doctor) up St Helens way as well," said Thomas.
 "I've heard so many stories about what people are doing and it made me just want to try and play a tiny, tiny part by trying to help out in a small way."
 Thomas lags a long way in funds raised behind a 99-year-old former soldier, Captain Tom Moore, who has become a national hero by raising over 20 million pounds by walking 100 laps of his garden.

Whether this oh-so-good liquid is known as soda, Coke or pop in your neck of the woods, anyone would be hard-pressed to beat the 700 flavors an Oklahoma visitor would find at Pops.      Route 66 travelers or those crossing Oklahoma on I-44: It is worth hitting the brakes and making your way to Pops. Yes, it is a gas station but, oh, it is so much more.      Historic Route 66 travelers will recognize Pops by what is deemed to be the largest soda bottle in the world. Standing 66 feet tall, this steel hoop bottle has thousands of LED lights attached and changes colors. When walking up to the shop one can't miss the display of thousands of soda bottles arranged by color in the large glass front of Pops. There are brands one might be familiar with or never heard of. Root beer seems to be one of the best sellers, and it comes in about 80 varieties.      If you can think of a flavor you can probably find it here. Buy one or order a make-your-own case at the kiosk.      It is not a place where one pulls up to the pump, fills the car with gas and walks into this store/restaurant and says, "Coke, please." It takes a lot of time to decide a flavor that fits your day. A soda seeker could get frostbite standing in front of the cooler reading the flavors. It is more like, "Give me a Bawls Guaran Exotic Blue and a Corn Squeezin' Citrus," or "I'll have a Dragon Tail Blazin' Tropical, please." Just reading the flavors will make a traveler get behind on their itinerary by an hour or so.      If you decide to have a bite to eat while visiting this glorified gas station, it is even more difficult. It is an eat-in or take-out restaurant. Pops' burgers are served with a heaping load of Pops Fries. The Pops "Ripper" Dog and Chili Dog are deep-fried quarter-pound all-beef hot dogs. Pops also has an avocado turkey wrap, chicken melt and salads. They offer options of veggie burgers and gluten-free buns.      After enjoying a meal, while still trying to decide a flavor of soda to take on the road, the subject of dessert might come up around the table. The old fashioned soda fountain is known for its milkshakes and floats, and Pops offers hand dipped ice cream, ice cream sandwich sundaes, root beer bread pudding, seasonal cobblers and more.      Pops also offers breakfast -- a signature omelet, buttermilk pancakes, waffles, French Texas toast, biscuits and gravy and, of course, the Mother Road Omelet with breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage, and French toast, pancakes or biscuits and gravy. Maybe breakfast is a great time to try the bacon flavored soda?      Pops opened as a convenience store, souvenir shop and restaurant in 2007. This soda pop stop is a great place for a rest from the road for those traveling in the Sooner State. Pops 66 Soda Ranch is north of Norman, right in the center of Oklahoma, at 660 W. Highway 66 in Arcadia.      At this time, Pops' restaurant is open for carryout only but the convenience store and gas station are open. Visit pops66.com for updates and hours.

Chhattisgarh, a heavily forested state in Central India with a majority of tribal population, narrates a tale of perseverance and tactful management of the pandemic with a total of 36 cases reported in the state by now, out of which 23 recovered, zero fatalities reported and 13 active patients undergoing treatment in AIIMS, Raipur. The state accounts for as little than 0.266% of share in COVID_19 cases across India and a recovery rate of 63.88% as of 17th April. The question is, How was it is possible to prevent the spread of virus in such an efficient and effective manner in the state with speedy recovery rates and not even a single death? Was it due to the proactive measures formulated by the state government or the excellent doctors at AIIMS, Raipur who were working around the clock to treat their patients or was it about the discipline exercised by the public or was it because of the public administration and police working endlessly to ensure and implement regulatory measures or was it because of the sanitation workers ensuring hygiene and cleanliness every day or maybe the lab experts who were constantly engaged in collecting test samples, knocking from one door to the other. Well, the credit goes to joint efforts laid down by all of them.

Liverpool Football Club have issued all staff with a list of unacceptable words and phrases, in the hope that this will prevent any unwanted off-field controversies enveloping the club this season.
 According to a leaked document seen by FourFourTwo.com, Reds officials will no longer be allowed to call anyone 'she-man', 'beefeater', or 'knob-jockey', nor will they be permitted to use slurs like 'pole smoker' or 'backdoor bandit'.
 'Georgie boy, 'macaroon' and 'candlestick maker' are also out, according to the new rules, as are phrases like 'hush little chickadee' and 'that's not the big boy mustard'.
 In a surprising development, however, the club took pains to confirm that the term 'bum brigand' would continue to be welcome at Anfield.
 'The club wishes to eradicate any form of discriminatory behavior both on and off the football pitch, and there are a number of offensive words which the club considers unacceptable,' the leaked statement reads.
 'However, after careful consideration of the arguments, we have decided to omit the term 'bum-brigand' from the banned list. 'Bum-brigand' and other similar references to brigandage of the bum are completely fine by us.'
 There has been speculation on Twitter about a parallel list of accepted slurs, headed by 'bum-brigand' and believed to include 'window-dresser', 'varmint', and 'spatchcock', though Liverpool have so far refused to comment.

A more complete answer is as follows – we are in a period where monopoly capitalism has shown itself to be a failed system. Not only has it failed to deal with the challenges of a pandemic, capitalism is a people-destroying economic system that is making the pandemic worse. Add on the facts that we are in the onset of a large-scale economic crisis and millions of people, including a section of the working class are turning towards socialism. So, a book that laid the ideological basis for the political party that organized and led the first successful socialist revolution is timely to say the least. It helps us figure out what we need to do the U.S. today.

For any school considering discontinuing programs, it’s getting easier to argue that men’s college soccer is less important each year in terms of providing opportunities to young people. Only 20 players selected from college in this past year’s MLS SuperDraft actually earned MLS contracts. (Eight more Homegrown Player signings in 2020 have U.S. college experience). By the fourth and final round of this year’s draft, 16 of 26 teams opted not to pass on their selections rather than take a flyer on a college player in training camp. This is not to say there are fewer young talented players than there used to be, just that many more of them are choosing to turn professional directly from club academies rather than taking the college route.

The Pitbull has gone. The meanest, nastiest, most violent, brutish and downright dangerous midfielder in La Liga has moved to Cardiff blooming City.
 Gary Medel, the one-man carnage machine who has the ability to mop up the messes of his back four, terrify both the opposition and his team-mates and boot chairs at police officers with no retribution from the plod.
 To be fair to Sevilla boss Unai Emery, it's easy to see why the ill-tempered Chilean has been packed off to Wales for a reported £11 million fee. While an in-form Medel is a forceful, physical presence in midfield for Sevilla, the 26-year-old can be an enormous liability, given his incredibly short fuse. "He finds it hard to stay calm," was the observation of former team-mate Albert Boti­a, after Medel was dismissed in April's Seville derby.
 It was an example of Medel's somewhat erratic behaviour towards the end of last season, a period which also saw the live-wire given his marching orders during a Copa del Rey clash with Atletico Madrid after giving Diego Costa a bit of a whack. That was after breaking the arm of Tiago Mendes in a hefty challenge earlier in the match.
 "In private, the Sevilla bosses are celebrating his sale to Cardiff," notes Monday's edition of _Marca_. However, that does sound a little mean considering Medel was perhaps the only footballer mad enough to sing Sevilla songs in an empty stadium as part of a promotional campaign.
 La Liga Loca's closest encounter with the former Sevilla man was outside the Rayo Vallecano dressing rooms. Normally, there is a short walk outside to the waiting coach of the visiting team. The general disorganisation in Vallecas make the spot a good one to ambush a player. Not Medel though, oh no. The Chilean strolled out the entrance to the dressing room area and everyone parted in seconds to allow to the squat South American footballer onto his bus.
 There's no show-boating, badge-kissing or pro-wrestler style growling from the Pitbull in showing off his toughness. There is no snarling and there are no threats. The punishment dished out by Medel, when required, is swift and brutal, like a Glaswegian bar fight. Indeed, the new Cardiff signing fits the description of being the Begbie of La Liga (link contains bad language and naughtiness). Premier League footballers should beware. Cardiff City fans should rejoice.

State officials say the Route 5S/Oriskany Street Safety Project through Utica is progressing well, as the Department of Transportation (DOT) is aiming to finish by the end of the year.
   
 The $18 million endeavor, which stretches from Cornelia Street to Broad Street, is nearing the end of its first phase, which includes drainage, curb, water mains, sidewalks, pavement, traffic signals and lighting primarily on the project's south side. It also consists of partial work on the future roundabout at the intersection of John Street and Oriskany Street and narrower lanes for better pedestrian safety.
   
 The roundabout at John Street will allow vehicles in all directions to effectively make left turns. Changes to the Genesee Street intersection will include protected left turn lanes.
   
 "Once this work is complete, the contractor will move into pre-Phase Two," DOT Public Information Officer Jim Piccola said. "In this phase, the contractor will have 10 days where eastbound traffic will be placed on a new alignment and existing westbound traffic will be placed into one lane. This will enable the contractor to complete the remaining roadwork along the new westbound alignment so existing westbound traffic can be placed on to the new alignment."
   
 The previous tree-filled median between the Route 5S lanes will be replaced by a new street next to existing businesses such as Great Rentals and Gerber's 1933 Tavern. A median will separate this road, called Liberty Street, from Route 5S.
   
 The new Liberty Street will start at lower Genesee Street and run to Washington Street. Liberty Street will be a one-way westbound until Hotel Street, where it will become a two-way street and will include on-street parking.
   
 "Once in Phase Two with traffic on the new alignment, the contractor can start work on the north side of the project, installing drainage, water mains, curb, sidewalks, pavement, lighting, and landscaping," Piccola said. "In the final phase, the contractor will (finish construction of) the remainder of the center median where needed."
   
 Piccola said project operations were atypical over the past couple of months due to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 He did not point to any specific challenges faced by crew members during the pandemic, saying that everyone has been complying with social distancing requirements.
   
 "Due to lower volumes of traffic, the contractor has been able to implement detours that would not normally be permitted due to normal traffic volumes on Route 5S," Piccola said.
