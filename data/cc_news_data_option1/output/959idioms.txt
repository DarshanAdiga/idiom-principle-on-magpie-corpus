Another thing - think twice about handling all those spoons, scoops, and tongs if you eat at a buffet. Wipe down the menu if it's laminated, as well as the salt and pepper shakers, ketchup bottle, etc.
 I used to never think twice about grabbing a shopping buggy (that's "cart" to some of y'all), but now I wipe down the handle and other areas of it. That's because I've seen a million little snotty-nosed kids sitting in the buggies with their grubby little hands all over the place.
 Remember as kids when we'd avoid the opposite sex because we were sure they had "cooties?" If this virus keeps up and spreads more, it might not be a bad idea, except avoid everybody, if possible. "Don't germ it - be a hermit!" That can be our motto, maybe. Practice air kisses and air hugs, and do knuckle bumps, rather than handshakes. I know a guy who is such a germaphobe that he will only bump elbows with you. I never heard of him getting sick, so maybe he's onto something.
 For right now, let's make the virus a matter of prayer. May we not spread a virus, but spread useful information. And don't spread fear. Chicken Little belongs in the children's book, rather than being personified by the hysterical. And don't emulate the boy that cried "wolf," either.

How bad? That is tough to say without knowing how the virus will play out. I tend to err on the side of being conservative, so here's how I look at things in the House of Mouse.
 Parks, Experiences, and Products will see a ~20% year-over-year drop in revenues, and slimmer margins of 22% based on reduced ticket prices at parks and discounted cruises. Revenues will thus be $20.98B, giving Disney an operating income of $4.62B.
 Media Networks will be stagnant. We will be coming up on the 2020 General Election in Disney's Q4, which will see an increase in ad spend, which should help balance out cord-cutting losses. Taking the FY19 numbers, Media Networks will have $24.83B in revenues and $7.5B in operating income.
 I think studio entertainment will see a hit this year due to cannibalization of the home market by Disney+, and lower box office revenues. The segment will be lucky to pull in $10B of revenues, which would equate to ~$2.4B in operating income.
 Finally, Direct-to-consumer. Revenues will soar here thanks to Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu. Expect the segment to grow to $20B in revenues, conservatively. Unfortunately, thanks to high rollout costs, Disney will take an operating loss of ~$2.5B in this segment.
 Adding it all up, we come to $75.8B in revenue and $11.99B in operating income. We must subtract $1B in operating income for eliminations resulting from internal content purchases, leaving us with ~$11B in operating income for 2020, or an 8% loss year-over-year.
 ## Is Disney A Buy At These Levels?
 Long-term, it is. However, I would personally wait a couple of months to see how domestic parks play out. If the company starts taking a big hit there, then there will be trouble on the horizon.
 If Disney were to drop below $100/share, I would start taking up a larger long-term position. At those levels, Disney would be trading at ~16x my presumed $11B of operating income, which would be more than enough to entice me into oversizing my position.

 It was Lowe’s father who first dreamed of using the abandoned Eagle Mountain mine to generate hydroelectric power. In the early 1990s, Art Lowe was being flown over the California desert by an engineer friend. Looking down at Eagle Mountain, the friend commented that the massive pits would be perfect for pumped storage.
 Art Lowe ran with the idea. He died in 2009, but his son Steve took up the mantle, obtaining a federal license for a 1,300-megawatt project and later selling a majority stake in the company his dad started, Eagle Crest Energy Co., to NextEra. The Florida-based energy giant owns four nearby solar farms in the desert east of Palm Springs, along Interstate 10.
 Like his father, Lowe thinks the site is perfect for pumped storage. The reservoirs are already built, reducing construction costs by hundreds of millions of dollars. The landscape is highly disturbed from decades of industrial mining.
 Alice Karl, a desert tortoise expert and longtime biological consultant for Eagle Crest, put it this way: “This seems like a good use of two big holes in the ground.”
 Conservation groups couldn’t disagree more.
 They say Eagle Crest’s plan to pump nearly 8 billion gallons of groundwater into its reservoirs, plus another half-billion gallons every year to replace water lost to evaporation, could harm plants and wildlife that depend on groundwater — a claim disputed by the developer. Critics also worry the project could make it harder for bighorn sheep to migrate to and from mountain ranges in Joshua Tree National Park, and could attract ravens that prey on young desert tortoises.
 The debate over groundwater pumping has been especially fierce given the project’s location in the hot, dry Colorado Desert, as well as the ongoing climate crisis that is fueling more extreme droughts in California and across the West.
 Joshua Tree officials say they agree with Eagle Crest that springs in the national park, which serve as oases for wildlife, are fed by shallow groundwater, not the deeper Chuckwalla Valley aquifer that Eagle Crest plans to tap. But conservationists are skeptical.
 Chris Clarke, a program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association, pointed to recent research in another part of the California desert, where Cadiz Inc. hopes to pump groundwater and sell it to cities. A study funded by Cadiz opponents found that a critical surface-level spring was in “hydraulic communication” with the underground aquifer.
 In the Eagle Mountain area, “there really isn’t a thorough analysis of the actual hydrology of the region,” Clarke said.
 Battles over energy projects are nothing new in the desert southwest, home to some of the country’s largest and most spectacular intact natural landscapes. Proposals for solar and wind farms have forced environmental groups to determine which projects are worth supporting as bulwarks against climate change and which would do too much harm.
 The Eagle Mountain lands were originally part of Joshua Tree National Monument, the predecessor to today’s national park. But Congress removed them in 1950 to clear the way for large-scale iron mining. Many conservationists feel the lands should have been returned to the park when mining stopped.
 The debate has migrated to Sacramento, where NextEra backed legislation in 2018 and 2019 that appeared narrowly targeted at helping Eagle Crest sign up a buyer for the electricity its project would generate. NextEra argued to lawmakers that California’s heavily regulated energy market may not be equipped to get a project this big financed and built.
 Critics countered that if the project were as useful and cost-effective as NextEra claimed, the company wouldn’t have any trouble finding a buyer.
 Both bills failed to advance. But conservationists fear another attempt is coming. They’re watching Assembly Bill 2255, which was introduced by Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, D-Stockton, but has yet to be filled out with detailed language.
 Asked whether the legislation will be a vehicle to support Eagle Mountain, Eggman’s chief of staff, David Stammerjohan, said the lawmaker is working to craft “a technology-neutral bill that focuses on the need for long-duration storage, that is not project-specific.”
 ———
 Across the country, projects like Eagle Mountain are sparking debate.
 Last spring, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied a preliminary permit for a facility that would have been built partly within West Virginia’s Monongahela National Forest. The proposal faced criticism from groups including Friends of Blackwater, which circulated a petition saying the project would “dam a tier 3 trout stream, impact sensitive species, and disturb the iconic Blackwater Canyon.”
 Another controversial project is in Arizona, where Pumped Hydro Storage LLC has proposed damming the Little Colorado River just outside Grand Canyon National Park. The Grand Canyon Trust, a private nonprofit, says the project would flood a sacred Hopi tribal site, threaten the endangered humpback chub and industrialize a remote hiking trail.
 Pumped Hydro Storage co-founder Steve Irwin said the company is working on a revamped proposal that involves damming a side canyon of the Little Colorado, rather than the river itself. That would make the company’s facility a “closed loop” plant that doesn’t interrupt natural waterways, although it would still disrupt a relatively undisturbed landscape.
 Environmentalists point to other technologies that might keep the lights on during the absence of sunlight and wind.
 Several California utilities signed contracts earlier this year for geothermal power plants, which can generate climate-friendly electricity around the clock. Los Angeles is investigating whether it can use underground salt caverns in Utah to bank clean energy in the form of compressed air or renewable hydrogen. The U.S. Navy recently eased its opposition to floating wind farms off California’s Central Coast, potentially helping the state access offshore winds that blow more consistently than onshore gusts.
 The Nature Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit, released a report last year examining how California might satisfy its appetite for clean energy without destroying sensitive lands. The report detailed 61 scenarios for meeting the state’s long-term goal of reducing planet-warming emissions 80% by 2050.
 Pumped storage “contributes a relatively small amount in those scenarios, and it’s not present in all scenarios,” said Erica Brand, director of the Nature Conservancy’s California energy program.

COVID-19, the disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus first detected in China in December, has rapidly spread across the globe and made its way to every continent besides Antarctica. The World Health Organization has stopped short of calling the outbreak a pandemic but has declared COVID-19 a "public health emergency of international concern."
 The outbreak is not only negatively affecting health but has stoked fears of an economic downturn. On Monday, stock trading was temporarily stopped shortly after the market opened when the S&P 500 index fell 7%, triggering an automatic 15-minute halt. Shares rebounded after the market reopened but remained in the red. Silicon Valley companies, including Apple, urged employees to work from home and instituted measures to help hourly workers affected by the policies. Around the globe, high-profile tech giants have been hit by supply chain issues in China. Social media networks, like Facebook and Twitter, have wrestled with the spread of misinformation and taken steps to mitigate the rise of conspiracy theories and panic.

As the United States negotiates a pull-out from Afghanistan after a nearly two-decade-long military engagement, at the cost of $2 trillion and 2,500 American lives, whether the Taliban are to be trusted remains an open question. But if past experience is any indication, there are reasons to be doubtful.
   
 The Taliban are seen as the preeminent bad guys threatening the interests of the U.S. in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region, undermining the stability of the U.S.-backed regime in Kabul and responsible for the loss of thousands of American lives since September 11, 2001.
   
 But who exactly are the Taliban defies simple answers. Religious fanatics holding aloft the banner of jihadism? Ethnic radicals hell-bent on creating a state of their own? A proxy militia manipulated by Pakistan? They are all of the above, and much else besides.
   
 What makes it so difficult to pin down their identities, ultimate goals and short-term strategies is that the term covers a wide spectrum of political actors, ethno-regional communities and presumptive leaders, each with distinctive ties to neighboring countries and jihadist networks.
   
 The Taliban were born in the Koranic schools (madrassas) of Pakistan during the presidency of Zia ul-Haq, known for his Islamic sympathies. During his term of office, coinciding with the Soviet invasion (1979-1988), the madrassas grew by leaps and bounds, infusing large doses of fundamentalist ideology in the minds of the thousands of Afghan refugee boys fleeing Soviet rule.
   
 All were offered free room and board as well as a heavy diet of jihadist education. According to the Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid, by the end of the Zia era in 1988, the number of madrasssas jumped from 900 in 1971 to 8,000 (and 25,000 unregistered ones) "educating" over half a million students.
   
 Further contributing to the Taliban's expansion, huge sums of Central Intelligence Agency money were funneled into the hands of their clerical leadership via the shadowy Inter-Service Intelligence, the intelligence arm of the Pakistan military, in hopes of boosting anti-Soviet activities among opposition parties and militias.
   
 The bulk of Taliban members and supporters are Pashtuns, an ethnic group accounting for about 40% of a population of 25 million. Like many of their ethnic brethren in Pakistan their hope is to unite into a single political entity, but this is a very long shot when you consider just how fragmented they are.
   
 The Pashtuns are divided into tribes and sub-tribes, clans and factions. The image that comes to mind is that of Russian dolls, each imbricated into the other.
   
 The former immensely corrupt president Hamid Karzai belonged to the Populzai tribe, which stood as distinct from and was bitterly opposed to the Ghilzai and Durrani tribes, each in turn subdivided into smaller groups, like the Shinwari and Tokhi. Viewing the Taliban as a culturally unified entity makes no more sense than lumping them together under the same political label.
   
 Cutting across the traditional tribal system are the different connections established with extremist factions. Some reached out to al-Qaida, others to the Islamic state or to less well- known Islamic parties (Hizb e-Islami, Jamaat e-Islami Jamat e-Islami), while others still are in thrall to local warlords.
   
 Forging a common consensus out of such disparate constituencies is like squaring the circle. One of the many problems facing the participants at the negotiating table is to ensure that what has been agreed upon by one faction will not be undone by another.
   
 There are many other potential stumbling blocks, including how many Taliban prisoners, if any, can be released; how many U.S. troops will remain on the ground during the transition to a full withdrawal; and whether the U.S. position on those issues are acceptable to Afghan government officials.
   
 The immediate problem to be solved is not whether the Taliban can ever agree to real peace, to which many are tempted to respond negatively, but who among the Taliban can stand as legitimate spokesmen for the group as a whole.
   
 The late Richard Holbrooke, President Barack Obama's special representative for Afghanistan, reportedly said, "We may be fighting the wrong enemy in the wrong country," a lesson learned at a high price by the British in the 19th century and the Soviets in the 20th century. It is now entering the consciousness of the Americans at an even higher cost in blood and treasure.

Plastic can be incredibly dangerous for sea turtles because they can mistake its smell for food, according to research published Monday.
 "We found that loggerhead sea turtles respond to odors from biofouled plastics in the same way they respond to food odorants, suggesting that turtles may be attracted to plastic debris not only by the way it looks, but by the way it smells," Joseph Pfaller of the University of Florida, Gainesville, said in a release. "This 'olfactory trap' might help explain why sea turtles ingest and become entangled in plastic so frequently."
 Biofouling is when algae, plants, microbes and small animals accumulate on wet surfaces, as happens to plastics in the ocean.
 It's long been believed that sea turtles mistake plastics for prey like jellyfish, but not much was known about how scent could play a role in drawing in sea turtles.

"Using a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, you may gently wipe the hard, nonporous surfaces of your Apple product, such as the display, keyboard, or other exterior surfaces," the company says. "Don't use bleach. Avoid getting moisture in any opening, and don't submerge your Apple product in any cleaning agents. Don't use on fabric or leather surfaces."
 Apple previously advised against using anything other than water to clean its products because some substances can wear down the oleophobic coating the company applies to keep its touchscreen devices looking their best. Health and safety take priority in this case. That said, there are a couple of things you can do to take care of both yourself and your device.
 Your best bet is to use isopropyl alcohol. Apply a small amount to a soft microfiber cloth and then wipe down your device. If you don't own a microfiber cloth, they're not expensive to buy. In a pinch, an old but clean t-shirt will also do the trick. Avoid spraying anything directly on your phone's display. You'll also want to avoid paper towels as they can cause small abrasions. After you've cleaned your phone, wash your hands as well.

Houston Astros starter Justin Verlander sounds like a longshot for Opening Day after being diagnosed with a strained muscle in his back. Verlander's self- assessment on Monday afternoon was it will "probably take a miracle" for him to be on the mound when the season begins.
 "But I don't want to take miracles off the table," said Verlander, 37, one day after he left his spring training start Sunday two innings before he was scheduled to be pulled. Earlier Monday, general manager James Click said Verlander was to be shut down and on a "no throw" regimen due to a "mild lat strain."
 Verlander left his spring training outing early Sunday and underwent tests, including an MRI exam. "By and large, the news we got today was on the positive side," Click said, adding a timetable for Verlander's return and his availability for Opening Day would be discussed at a later date.
 Verlander, who had been expected to pitch four innings against the host New York Mets at Port St. Lucie, Fla., exited after two innings. Astros manager Dusty Baker said Monday that Verlander was feeling much better and was glad he left the game when he did.
 Baker said he didn't detect anything wrong by watching Verlander throw, only by what the right-hander said after returning to the dugout following the second inning. The manager added the pitcher's velocity had been "down a tick" from his first spring start on Tuesday. Verlander allowed three hits and struck out one in his second spring start. He had been dealing with groin tightness earlier in spring training.
 The reigning American League Cy Young Award winner has been extremely durable, pitching at least 200 innings in 12 of the last 13 seasons and making 30 or more starts in 13 of his 14 full major league seasons. He has a career mark of 225-129 with a 3.33 ERA. --Field Level Media

All we know about the coronavirus, for example, comes to us through the filter of the major news media. It would be too cynical, and possibly deadly, to discount it as just the latest hype. However, it’s telling that I had to dig pretty deep to find that a significant percentage of infected people have already recovered. Why isn’t that a headline?
 What about the election news? My guess is that there’s an enormous amount of money to be made from keeping us all on edge about who’s up or down, or who’s gaining or falling behind, like a horse-race announcer.
 We hear far too little about what various candidates believe or propose, and even less about the honest, real-world impact of all the plans and proposals. In our soundbite, Twitter, Snapchat culture, most people are no longer willing to sit through a true debate and rational exchange of ideas.
 Maybe the media have us pegged and know we won’t notice that most of the promises and plans will never become reality. They breathlessly warn us that this will be “the most significant election in our lifetime.”
 That’s what they said last time, and the time before that. And how could we possibly know that until we get a bit more perspective that only the passing of years can give us, a perspective that could bring some calm and sanity to the present moment?
 Sometimes I long for the days when Walter Cronkite or Huntley and Brinkley would just sit and read the news without fluff, flash or fanfare. Maybe they weren’t any more accurate or honest than today’s media, but at least there wasn’t as much drama and hype and panic. They were only on a half-hour a day, and yet we somehow survived.
 There’s no going back, of course. We’ll never again know life without instantaneous 24-hour media and ubiquitous screens blinking and screaming at us, though we would if we turned them off once in a while.
 If we’d look at something besides a screen, if we took a walk outside and listened, if we took time to listen to each other, if we read a good book, or if we talked to God once in a while, maybe we’d be quicker to spot what’s fake and what’s fact.

“Si bien es cierto que han cambiado los hábitos de consumo, la televisión continúa siendo muy relevante en México y a nivel global, tanto para las audiencias como para los anunciantes”.
 En el año 2019 se presentaron cambios significativos en temas referentes al consumo de medios. La televisión, por primera vez en la historia, y de acuerdo con un reporte de la consultora Zenith Media, dejó de ser la plataforma estrella de los medios masivos de comunicación, otorgando esa posición a un nuevo favorito: el internet.
 El mismo reporte reveló que, el año pasado, el uso promedio de la web fue de 170 minutos (2 horas con 50 minutos) diarios por persona, mientras que el de la pantalla chica fue de 167 minutos. Este cambio, cabe mencionar, se ha producido de manera paulatina, ya que se ha observado un descenso en el consumo de televisión, tanto abierta como de paga, durante los últimos diez años.
 De 2009 a 2019, el tiempo diario para ver televisión abierta decreció de 3 horas con 16 minutos a 2 horas con 33 minutos, mientras que el de televisión de paga, en 2018, pese a registrar un crecimiento de 36 minutos a 1 hora con 5 minutos, presentó un descenso de 21%. En efecto, la gente ha comenzado a migrar; estamos dejando de ver los programas de televisión, para dar paso al consumo de contenido a través de internet, el cual, se sabe, se encuentra en gradual aumento.
 Según datos del Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT), cerca de un tercio de la audiencia paga una suscripción periódica; las plataformas más utilizadas son YouTube (77%), seguida por Netflix (27%), mientras que el dispositivo que más se usa para consumir contenidos es el teléfono celular (81%).
 Este suceso se debe a diversos factores, entre ellos, el cambio en las preferencias del consumidor. En la actualidad, los jóvenes opinan que los contenidos de la televisión son de mala calidad, poco creativos, repetitivos y, en algunos casos, discriminatorios. De igual forma, denotan, como una de las desventajas de la televisión abierta, el exceso de publicidad, las fallas en la señal y la baja resolución en comparación con el contenido ofrecido por _streaming_ o internet.
 Pero, ¿qué pasa con las nuevas plataformas de _streaming_? Éstas han cambiado la forma que conocíamos para consumir contenidos, al ofrecer a las audiencias novedosas opciones, como, contenidos grabados (películas y series), los cuales se pueden visualizar en el momento y en lugar que quieran, sin cortes comerciales.
 Además, de acuerdo con el estudio “Hábitos de consumo de medios de comunicación por jóvenes”, del IFT (2019), la principal razón para consumir contenido a través de plataformas _Over The Top_ (OTT), es la libertad de elegir qué ver y en qué momento. El 43% de las personas consume contenidos audiovisuales a través de su _smartphone_ , gracias a que este dispositivo puede ser llevado a cualquier lado.
 Asimismo, plataformas como Netflix permiten a los usuarios descargar episodios de sus series o películas favoritas en su dispositivo móvil, para poder visualizarlas sin la necesidad de utilizar sus datos o estar conectados a una red WiFi.
 Otros factores involucrados, además de la libertad de elección, accesibilidad a las plataformas de OTT y conectividad en redes sociales, es la industria telefónica, la cual ha impulsado el posicionamiento de internet a través de la fabricación de teléfonos inteligentes para clientes con diferente poder adquisitivo.
 Si bien es cierto que han cambiado los hábitos de consumo en varios aspectos, el fin de la era de la televisión todavía se vislumbra lejano. Ésta continúa siendo muy relevante en México y a nivel global, tanto para las audiencias como para los anunciantes.
 Tampoco se puede olvidar que las televisoras y las empresas de streaming son las principales responsables de generar contenido, el cual se puede transmitir en diferentes medios, ya sea TV abierta, TV de paga, sitios web, plataformas OTT, medios digitales, salas de cine, DVD, entre otros; en consecuencia, la televisión todavía no está “fuera de la jugada”.
 En el caso particular de México, la TV se ha convertido en un medio que impulsa la convivencia y se utiliza de manera rutinaria. La televisión abierta continúa siendo, por ejemplo, un medio en el que se distribuye un gran número de eventos deportivos. Tal es el caso del futbol, al transmitirse la mayoría de los partidos de la liga mexicana por dicho medio.
 De igual forma, es de destacar que uno de los contenidos más vistos por los jóvenes son los noticieros matutinos y nocturnos, que son utilizados como una especie de compañía para este sector de la población al momento de realizar sus actividades rutinarias entre semana.
 Actualmente, de acuerdo con la encuesta nacional del IFT “Consumo de Contenidos Audiovisuales” (2018), los canales de televisión abierta son vistos por 72% de la población. No obstante, la tendencia global es que la gente consuma cada vez menos minutos de TV y, además, que más hogares “corten el cable” o, mejor dicho, “la televisión de paga”.
 Considerando lo anterior, la realidad es que en este enfrentamiento por la audiencia nada está aún definido. La televisión y el internet todavía tienen un largo camino por explorar en el corto y largo plazos, y aunque pudiera parecer que la televisión está quedándose atrás, lo cierto es que los datos muestran una perspectiva alentadora no solo para el internet, sino también para la TV.

Red-winged blackbirds are one of the earliest spring migrants to return. My story took place last week, in early March, which is actually a few weeks later than we usually start seeing them. In fact, Elena from Winchester had a few hardy red-winged blackbirds visit her feeders all throughout winter. The flock I saw the other day carried on for a while and then suddenly got quiet. I don’t know if the birds spotted a predator or if they were ready to settle in for the night as it was well into dusk.
 I certainly could have missed something, especially considering the fading light, but I noted only grackles and red-winged blackbirds. These mixed flocks of blackbirds often have brown-headed cowbirds and starlings as well. If you’re lucky and take the time to scrutinize over the individual birds in the flock, you may find an unexpected visitor such as yellow-headed blackbird, boat-tailed grackle or rusty blackbird. It is believed that blackbirds winter and migrate in large flocks to offer better protection against predators and, perhaps, more effectively find food sources.
 Yes, the spring migration is under way. It won’t be long now before the phoebes start showing up. To me, the return of “my” phoebes to the backyard signifies the real beginning of spring. Then, of course, birds of all shapes, colors and sizes will return to New England to either breed here or pass through on their way to northern breeding grounds.
 It hasn’t been much of a winter, at least where I am in New England. That doesn’t mean winter is over, not by any means. I’ve been in New England long enough to know that we aren’t out of the woods until the third or even fourth week of April. Let’s hope it’s not another winter that stretches well into our spring. But that’s out of our control. If it is a long winter, we will deal with it. We always do.

Millicent Lash      Burlington - Millicent "Penny" Lash, 93, of Burlington, Vermont passed away peacefully on March 8, 2020.      Penny was born in Port Chester, NY October 16, 1926. She spent her childhood there attending Port Chester schools where she was an exemplary student skipping three grades and graduating at age 15.      Shortly thereafter she moved to Burlington to attend the University of Vermont from which she graduated in 1946. One weekend while at college she was introduced to her future husband, Nat Lash, on a blind date. Nat was born and raised in Burlington and was home for the weekend from Boston University. It was love at first sight and they married shortly after Penny graduated from college. Theirs was a close, loving, devoted relationship for 54 years. Nat predeceased Penny in 2000.      Penny was an avid reader and constantly visited the Fletcher Free Library borrowing thousands of books over her 77 years living in Burlington. She was an intellectual with interests in art, music, politics, cuisine, fashion and travel.      She was revered as a gourmet cook and baker hosting dinner parties for friends where every hors d'oeuvres, entree, and dessert was made from scratch. She subscribed to virtually every cooking magazine and purchased vast quantities of cook books that she read like novels.      Her taste and innate sense of style and fashion were integral to the great success her husband achieved in the furniture business. Penny accompanied Nat on all buying trips as an equal partner in selecting merchandise for Vermont's foremost furniture stores for quality and style, Town and Country Furniture and Modern Design. Their love of travel took them to many parts of Europe, Asia and the United States. Purchases made on these journeys provided customers the unique opportunity to purchase exotic items not available anywhere else.      Penny volunteered with the

Give and take, the NASS has no powers to make laws on any matter which the Constitution has not granted such powers to it or made express provisions for it until the Constitution itself is amended. We expect the lawmakers to know that regardless of whatever they consider as loopholes in existing laws, as long as it is reflected in the Constitution, its wishful thinking that subsidiary laws by an Act of parliament can vacate the potency, effect or functionality of provisions of the Constitution, unless it is amended.

 ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A SeaWorld guest stole wallets from the stroller of two Make-A-Wish Foundation visitors and used their cards to buy Apple watches, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said.
 Krystle Henry, 37, was arrested on several charges Friday, including grand theft over $750 and obtaining goods with stolen credit card.
 Authorities said the two guests from Make-A-Wish Foundation were watching a show at SeaWorld on Feb. 9 and left their purses in a stroller outside the stadium.
 The Orlando Sentinel reported both victims spotted charges of over $400 on their debit cards at Walmart and 7-Eleven.
 Deputies used surveillance video from Walmart to track Henry buying the items.

To the Editor:
   
 In a letter entitled "Impeachment was an unconstitutional coup attempt," Cheryl Russell of Dover strings together GOP talking points seeking to de- legitimize Trump's impeachment with a view toward the upcoming election.
   
 She says the House impeachment hearings were a charade "driven by hatred of a duly elected president"; that in not going to the Judiciary over defiance of subpoenas the committees denied due process; that those who disagree with her either did not watch the hearings or are victims of liberal bias; that Republican senators protected us from a "clear and present danger."
   
 In reciting the truth that "we must all uphold the Constitution of the United States or we are doomed as [a] country," she seeks to stake out the high ground - but those of us who not only watched the hearings but have studied the Constitution (and have taught college courses about it) know how misguided Ms. Russell is.
   
 In establishing separation of powers, the Constitution makes the House responsible to impeach a president if a majority of congresspersons find there is cause to do so. By definition, this is not a "coup." In exercising this responsibility, the House acts like a grand jury - with a full due process trial to take place in the Senate. It is not the fault of the House if senators choose not to call (and cross-examine) witnesses.
   
 In reciting Fox News spin-doctoring, Ms. Russell supports Trump's efforts to mislead, gaslight and con voters. We can only hope and pray that voters will see through this.

Rising need for storage devices in order to store and secure large amounts of data is a key factor driving market growth of network attached storage. Several enterprises especially in the BFSI and ITeS sectors have reduced their dependency on paperwork and focus more on producing data on computers and similar devices. This has led to growing need for external storage devices as an appropriate back-up solution, and also to store huge amounts of data. The impact of this driver is expected to strengthen by the end of the forecast period. Further, owing to the robust growth rate of unstructured data, which is expanding at a CAGR of more than 60% per annum and expected to show the same display over the past few years, the demand for NAS seems optimistic. High performance network attached storage systems are also enhancing their performance through data reduction and acceleration hardware techniques, to cut the amount of data which needs to be stored. Implementation of clustered NAS systems is yet another way to enhance performance. Clustered NAS joins file server nodes under a global namespace. In addition, unified or multiprotocol storage, that combines file and block storage, cloud storage, and open source NAS are some of the trends affecting the growth of the NAS market.

Fifty years ago, Alvin Toffler published "Future Shock," which was an early exploration of the impact of change on society in general. It turns out the principles apply across the board to all areas of today's world including the church.
   
 Toffler called attention to the inevitability of social, technological and economic change and predicted an ever-tightening time-cycle for this change. It proved to be one of the more prescient and influential books of that era and continues to wield influence today.
   
 "Future Shock" sounded a universal warning about ignoring the impact of change. The toughest lesson requires a counterintuitive understanding that to preserve critical core values of any organization requires a willingness to accept and embrace changes in the basic system within which those values exist.
   
 Yet many organizations and institutions, including the Christian church, continue to cling tenaciously to the past while the future rushes headlong into a wall of crumbling resistance. What to do? What to do? Try this. No, try that!
   
 No matter who said it, Einstein or someone else, the idea of getting different results from trying the same thing over and over is pretty sure to fail. Even tweaking the attempts to avoid previous errors oftentimes results in only slightly different outcomes. In the past 30 or 40 years a lot has been said and written about ways to slow and/or stop the steady pace of change and decline within American Christianity.
   
 The approaches vary but often center on attempts to start new congregations or "restart" struggling churches by adding new programs, all in an attempt to increase participation and thereby extend the impact of the church. There are reports that some of these approaches have produced results in some situations, but overall, the picture remains one of slow and steady decline.
   
 Too often the best laid plans have little impact on future numbers of participation. As one of the four great "estates" of western civilization in the 18th century, the church (exemplified through the clergy) has slipped precipitously into a diminished role worldwide.
   
 The church itself continues to sound the alarm; continues to point out the decline and warn of the future consequences. Is this self-serving, or is it a clarion call of future social degradation? Maybe both? In any event the effort to find answers continues.
   
 However, the Christian church in general is legendary in its resistance to change. Witness the flat-earth controversies, the sun-centered universe, the reluctance to condemn slavery, the evolution debate, down to the current disputes on female clergy and the full inclusion of homosexuals. And while the modern church continues to struggle, unrelenting change continues to chip away at the collective body of believers.
   
 While there are "mega churches" that draw thousands each week, the majority of Christian worship takes place in smaller, community-based churches. Herein lies a big chunk of the problem -- loss of a critical mass necessary to sustain and grow the core organization. Churches don't fall from the sky fully formed, fully staffed and fully funded.
   
 It takes resources (i.e. personnel, facilities and money) to create and sustain a church. Even though Christianity emphasizes an ethic of self- sacrifice and frugality, when the overall numbers decline, many churches are finding themselves in the Catch-22 of being near or below the level of participation necessary to sustain the existing staff -- physical plant and missional spending. Starting a new church or expanding an existing church is a distant and fraught hope for most.
   
 There is no shortage of ideas out there, but there may be a shortage of systemic thinking that recognizes the importance of intra-denominational commitment to maintaining existing congregational bonds while supporting a sustainable infrastructure that can sustain that need.
   
 Churches are often insular. They feel comfortable with their own traditions, practices and familiar faces, and while the desirability of nurturing community is a bedrock principle of a Christian church, new approaches could mitigate the stress of change.
   
 While it would take lots of goodwill, open minds and willingness to work at it, smaller congregations could be revitalized by joining together to share common needs such as administrative and managerial costs, facility maintenance and other fiscal expenses.
   
 By working diligently to maintain congregational identity while embracing a bigger and more inclusive community, everyone could benefit from shared or time-variable pastoral leadership and the advantages of experienced and dedicated staff made possible by pooled costs. Would it be easy? No, but it absolutely can be done!
   
 Think of it as "future shock" absorbers.

"The second one is economic uncertainty. They go hand in hand," he said. "Banks have historically been a pretty good proxy for the economy. You start thinking loan growth is going to slow and credit losses will pick up if the economy slows down."
 Among large-cap banks, KBW wrote that energy loans represent 15 per cent of Citigroup's tangible common equity (TCE) compared with 10 per cent for Wells Fargo and Bank of America and 7 per cent for JPMorgan.
 Citi analyst Keith Horowitz cited "relatively modest" exposure to oil and gas loans among big banks in his research note but listed bigger issues including higher odds of a recession, a market overreaction to credit risks, and lower interest rates.
 "The fear factor from the virus is clearly causing economic strain, and as a result, the odds of a recession are moving higher even though it is not in the data yet," said Horowitz.
 The analyst said he was most worried that rates would fall further.
 "Fundamentally, this is what we are most concerned about and believe that today’s actions only increase the likelihood of lower rates."
 While some market strategists have said Monday's broad sell-off, with the S&P last down 7 per cent , could be a buying opportunity, Horowitz said his customers were wary.
 "There is very little 'buy the dip' mentality in conversations we're having with investors," he said.

I find it helpful to remember that the news business is just that, a business. Like any other enterprise, it takes money to make the mare go, and crises and disasters and conflict, and even questionable facts, draw eyeballs and ratings.
 That’s why, in recent years, news stations have apparently discovered the drama and ratings potential of weather. The local meteorologists toss around words like “hammered” and “ramped up” and “walloped” and “brutal wind chills.” One station has started giving hurricane-like names to severe winter storms.
 It makes me wonder how mankind ever survived without some well-coiffed, media- trained personality informing us how cold we really feel and how to stay warm and what to wear and how we’re going to survive the latest threat to humanity.
 Even if the weather is perfect now, they’re on the spot to insist that the worst is yet to come next week or next month or in some far-off year when, conveniently, none of us will be here to find out whether the climate and weather hype was fake or not.
 The real message, I think, is keep watching and depend on us to protect you. Thanks, but I think I’ll just go outside and decide for myself how warm or cold I feel. I think Kipling was on to something when he advised, “If you can keep your head while all about you are losing theirs, ... you’ll be a man, my son.”
 It’s hard to know whether to believe what we’re hearing.
