CONTROVERSIAL PENALTY
 United ran out a comfortable winner at Villa Park, but only after being set on its way by a controversially awarded penalty.
 Fernandes went to ground just inside the area even though he appeared to tread on the right ankle of Villa defender Ezri Konsa after spinning on the ball.
 After a consultation with VAR, the on-field decision to award a penalty was upheld and Fernandes sent Pepe Reina the wrong way from the spot in the 27th minute.

Major League Baseball will open the 2021 season on April 1 and hopes to have every team play its first game on the same day for the first time since 1968.
 The league released the full schedule Thursday, two weeks before it plans to begin a 2020 season that’s been delayed and shortened by the coronavirus pandemic. MLB intended to start this season on March 26, its earliest opening date ever except for international games.
 The league also hoped to have all 30 clubs play on the same opening day this season, but that was spoiled when Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended spring training in March.
 Instead, a 60-game regular season schedule is scheduled to begin July 23, with clubs set to play only division foes and regional interleague opponents — AL East vs. NL East, AL Central vs. NL Central, AL West vs. NL West — to limit travel.

“We’re actually hoping there’s way more in the tank,” he said. “We believe that. And again, you’ll never hear me go on spring training numbers, but it’s still fun to watch what a guy can do. I think in 20 at-bats, he’s hitting the ball all over the place.
 “And he’s maturing as a hitter. You see him in BP, he’s hitting the ball to right field. We know he can hit the ball towards the lights. But having an approach in batting practice to keep yourself where you have balance and rhythm and things like that, he’s going to hit some home runs by mistake.”
 Francona will likely use Reyes as his primary designated hitter, but he may also get some time in right field. Reyes has been working on making himself a better fielder, and Francona said the effort — especially as he improves at tracking the ball — is beginning to pay off.
 Reyes gives the Indians’ lineup some flexibility.

MyHSR reappoints Mohd Nur Ismal as CEO, effective today KUALA LUMPUR, July 10 — Datuk Mohd Nur Ismal Kamal has returned to MyHSR Corporation Sdn Bhd following his reappointment as its chief executive officer, effective today. He is a familiar face to MyHSR Corp, having led the company in the same capacity from 2015 until late last year when his contract ended. “I am humbled and honoured to have been given the trust to lead MyHSR Corp at such an important phase in its progress and development. “I am looking forward to building on this success whilst simultaneously ensuring we remain focused on creating a positive impact on our economy, rakyat and ultimately our country,” he said in a statement today. Mohd Nur Ismal will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (KL-SG HSR) project, amongst others. He holds a Master of Business Administration Degree in Strategy, Finance and Marketing from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management, Northwestern University, Illinois and has a Degree in Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in Finance and Decision Sciences from the University of Denver in Colorado. He was also previously CEO of the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD), now known as Land Public Transport Agency (APAD). Mohd Nur Ismal has vast experience and been involved in the Malaysian public transportation industry since 2008 and played a key role in the launch of four Go-KL City Bus routes in Kuala Lumpur, the building of Malaysia’s first Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and the development of the National Land Public Transport (LPT) Masterplan, which helped set the vision of direction for the public transportation industry in Malaysia. He had also led the Klang Valley MRT project development including the successful launch of the first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Malaysia. It was reported last May that Malaysia would resume discussions with Singapore on the KL-SG HSR following its decision to proceed with the joint project which was suspended in 2018. The Economic Planning Unit under the Prime Minister’s Department and MyHSR Corp were tasked with identifying the cost reduction options while maintaining the socio-economic benefits to be generated by the project. The proposed KL-SG HSR is expected to be operational in 2031 and reduce travel time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to 90 minutes. — Bernama Datuk Mohd Nur Ismal Kamal has been reappointed chief executive officer of MyHSR Corporation Sdn Bhd. — Bernama file pic

Veteran England fast bowler Stuart Broad admitted that he is "frustrated, angry and gutted" after being dropped for England's first Test against West Indies in Southampton.
 This is the first time since 2012 that Broad, a regular new-ball partner for James Anderson, has missed a home Test.
 England decided to go with a pace attack consisting of Anderson, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and captain Ben Stokes for the match. The fifth bowler is spinner Dom Bess.
 "I found out about 6pm the night before the game. Stokesy told me that we are going with extra pace on these conditions," said Broad on Sky Sports.
 "I spoke to (national selector) Ed Smith last night, he is involved in picking the 13 and they picked purely for this pitch. I wanted clarification on the future going forward and I was given pretty positive feedback."
 Broad was the highest wicket-taker for England in their two previous Test series. He admitted that the decision to drop him has been a hard one for him to understand.
 "I'm not a particularly emotional person but I have found the last couple of days tough. To say disappointed is an understatement, I've been frustrated, angry, gutted, because it is quite hard to understand," he said.
 "I've probably bowled the best I ever have in the last couple of years. I felt like it was my shirt having been in the team during the Ashes and in South Africa."
 Broad however said that England are in a unique position considering all their fast bowlers are fit to play.
 "Very rarely do you get all your bowlers fit like we have got now. Part of my strength as a cricketer has been that I have always been fit and available for selection.
 "So I was frustrated by the fact that I expected to get a place in the team as everyone else. Chris Woakes, Sam Curran all bowling pretty well here, all probably deserve to be in the 11 but aren't."
 The 34-year-old, who is 15 wickets away from becoming the second England bowler after Anderson to go past 500 Test wickets, said that he is also glad to be feeling frustrated.
 "But also I am quite pleased I feel frustrated, gutted and angry because if I didn't then I would have had a different decision to make. I have nothing to prove, the selectors know what I can do and when I get that opportunity again you can bet that I will be on the money," he said.

Fox notes progression of finding solutions is vital given the current issues impacting society.
 “We’ve had two extreme black swan events within a year,” Fox said. “Our producers are really wondering if they can continue to weather the storm. This has been financially devastating for the producers in our industry. Most recently what we saw with COVID-19 is the struggle many producers had to get bids on their cattle here in Iowa.”
 At this time, Fox says a Senate Ag Committee hearing has not been scheduled.

“There was probably five or six people up by the green, and no one did anything,” Bradley said. “We walked up to the green, I fixed my ball mark. I’m looking all over the green for it. And someone just goes, ‘It’s in the hole,’ like really casually. It was just bizarre.”
 And it will be that way for two weeks.

I think at the end of the day, it will be a great experience. I think what’s happening now is the unknown of it, nobody knows what’s going to happen. Yes, we’re getting information daily, updates daily, but there’s still an unknown of what’s going to happen. So, we can plot and plan and say this and say that, do this, do that, but we won’t know until we actually get there on how all of this is actually going to play out. It’s the unknown that everybody is kind of on edge about. But once we get there and start playing, it’s going to ease the bubble factor a lot. Also, for me, I’m going to make it fun for myself. I’m going to bring my wine; I’m going to have these experiences with guys that are down there. You're talking about being in ‘bubble’ for three months, right? So, you need to figure out ways to maneuver through that and be creative and talk to people and just enjoy the days because a lot of times—just to give you a little insight of what an NBA day is like—you practice in the morning for two or three hours then you have the rest of your day…Game days are locked down but outside of that, it’s one of the easiest schedules in sports that we can have because again, we practice for a couple of hours and then everybody’s just on their own after that. I say that to say I’ll bring a lot of wine to Orlando, ‘What’s in your Glass’ [my podcast] will be live from the bubble, so I’ll send you guys the address!…[But] it’s the ultimate sacrifice at the end of the day. This is a major, major sacrifice. Just being down there and sacrificing and taking the chance in this world with what’s happening whether it's COVID, whether it’s social injustices that’s happening, we’re taking the chance, but we also understand the power that we have. The unknown of being there is one aspect of it but being able to have this platform to execute something that we really want to execute—one message, what do we stand for…this is an opportunity for the NBA to come out with a strong message, the NBA as a whole, as an association, but also as players too. As players I’m sure we’re going to come together, we’re going to figure something out, we’re going to talk…have these uncomfortable conversations that people don’t want to have…They [the NBA] want to make it fun for us at the end of the day—we’re going to bring everything there! We’re going to have live DJs, we’re going to have games, we’re going to be able to go outside…we’re still at Disney at the end of the day…[But] I didn’t want people to think that we would be distracted by what’s continuing to happen in our society, community and country. I know for a fact, that’s not going to happen. We’d never use our game to walk away or turn our back to what’s happening out there in the world. If anything, we’ll be using this platform to enhance the message of what’s happening and bring it to the forefront…it is what it is, and we have to make the best of it. I’m carrying my own 12-case [of wine] with me and everything else will be shipped [laughs].

To most Americans, it may seem obvious that a government should live up to its word. But the United States has regularly reneged on the promises that it made to American Indian nations in the nearly 400 treaties that it negotiated with them between 1778 and 1871. Many people feared that the Supreme Court would turn a blind eye to another treaty breach in this case, McGirt v. Oklahoma.

Bellinger spent the last few months working out in his home state of Arizona after spring training came to a halt in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. He focused on fine-tuning his swing.
 “I just got to work on it in a stress-free environment,” he said. “Just minor things I think about throughout the year. Figuring out why I was so good and remembering the feeling and not getting too caught up on last year. You’re always evolving. I feel really good with where I’m at this year. It could be a blessing in the long run.”
 Bellinger and Roberts said hitters’ concerns about the new batter’s eye in the renovated outfield pavilions at Dodger Stadium are being addressed. First baseman Max Muncy hurt his left ring finger after he said he couldn’t see a pitch that hit him earlier in the week.
 “It was a little low,” Bellinger said, “and the seats weren’t blocked off, so if there were fans there, the pitcher’s arm would potentially come out of the stands.”

Coming back from Cuba, I remember I had an ‘86 Margaux. And that was the only bottle that we saved [because] I said we need something to drink on the way back. So, we go to the airport in Cuba, we go through the line and the security check, and I actually forget to put the wine in my luggage. And as I’m going through, they grabbed my 1986 Margaux; they just throw the Margaux in a trash bin. All I hear is the bottle clanking [against] other bottles. I’m like, ‘What just happened here?’ I look in the trashcan and I see 100 bottles of wine and liquor, and at the top, it was a 1986 Margaux…The only thing I kept saying is, ‘Where’s Pelé? I need Pelé to hurry up and get here,’ because we needed his security team to talk to the airport people and get the wine back. All I cared about was that wine at the end of the day…I really wanted that wine! His team did a phenomenal job of pleading—we even had the military there trying to get that wine, the head of the airport trying to get that wine! Eventually, we got the wine at the end of the day. That story was incredible but going through it and dealing with it, I was a little nervous, I was upset, [laughs] I was angry because I was really looking forward to drinking that wine but most importantly, I didn’t like how they handled my wine. They took it and tossed it into the trashcan!
