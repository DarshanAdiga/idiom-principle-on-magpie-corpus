LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Oldham County Schools will transition to remote learning for at least three weeks starting Friday after the county hit the "red zone" in Kentucky's COVID-19 incidence rate metric, Superintendent Greg Schultz announced Monday.
 OCS will cease in-person instruction through Dec. 4, Schultz wrote in a letter to families. Oldham County's COVID-19 incidence rate on Monday was 27.4 new daily cases per 100,000 residents based on a seven-day rolling average.
 "Red zone" counties, which indicate the highest risk of coronavirus spread, are those with more than 25 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents per day.
 Gov. Andy Beshear and state health officials have said schools in counties with such high COVID-19 incidence rates should move to distance learning.
 Schultz said a decision on resuming classroom instruction will be made by Dec. 3. Regular season games for district athletics have also been suspended, though practices may continue, he said.
 "If we remain in the red category but do not see a sizable increase in the county incident rate, we may consider returning to in-person instruction," he wrote in the letter to families. "We are continually monitoring the numbers of staff and students with positive cases and the numbers of those in quarantine to inform our decisions.
 "For this reason, it is imperative that parents report positive test results and quarantines to their school during (nontraditional instruction)."
 Schultz also cited a growing number of COVID-19 cases and quarantines among students and staff as factors in his decision to temporarily close the district's classrooms.
 The district reported nine new COVID-19 cases among students and eight new cases among staff to the Kentucky Department for Public Health last week, with 47 students and three staff quarantined, according to the agency's coronavirus dashboard.
 "During this period of increased community spread, we ask that you follow Covid-19 guidelines such as limiting social gathering, staying home when ill, quarantining if exposed to a person who tests positive, and wearing facial coverings when out in the community," Schultz wrote in the letter.
 "Doing these things will greatly increase the likelihood of lowering our incidence rate and continuing in-person instruction."

As that price indicates, this is a console for more casual players. The Series X is for people with a dedicated home-entertainment setup: the 4K TV, the Dolby Atmos sound, the gaming headphones and probably some flashing RBG lights in the mix. The Series S is for those who don't have a setup designed to extract every last pixel.
 And this is reflected in the way it makes you buy games. Or rather, how it encourages you to _not_ buy games at all. Because the Xbox Series S is all about Game Pass.

About 12 million low-income people are covered through the health law's Medicaid expansion, now available in most states. Most of them are adults working in jobs that don't pay all that much, and don't come with health insurance. Some have lost jobs in businesses like hotels, restaurants, and movie theaters, which continue to struggle because of the pandemic.

We win a lot because we really, truly, deep down believe that we're going to win. I think that comes from battling against each other all the time and understanding that it takes more than just a desire to win to win. It takes a belief, it takes a determination, and it takes hard work. It takes a trust and it takes a vulnerability with each other to show up in that way, and to be able to kind of lay it out all on the line all the time. I've been in so many games, honestly, where I feel like the other team is too insecure to show how much they want to win. And so they just don't. There's no insecurity on our team about that. We will embarrass ourselves to the nth degree to win a game. ... I feel like other teams, like want to win, of course, because you're playing in a game and that's the whole point, you want to win. But to [want to win] in a very raw way, in a very vulnerable way, just be like, we don't care if we're down 4 - 0, we will never give up. We don't care if we look stupid or whatever. We just focus on winning and never giving up.

The Stars, who were 15-10 last season, jumped right into conditioning and fundamental drills on Day 1.
 “One thing that helped us a little, which I hate for the football team, is that we got the football guys a little earlier than usual because their playoff game got canceled (again, because of the coronavirus),” Hein noted. “Once they were cleared, those kids got out here with us, and I think we have 22 football kids out this season.
 “But it’s a different kind of conditioning between football and basketball, so we’re working those guys into basketball shape as quickly as we can, and the other guys are working at it, too.
 “So we get right into conditioning. That and fundamentals and defense are always the priorities for the first couple of weeks. We have got to be a good defensive team to compete with the teams on our schedule.”
 Hein normally would keep around 18 players between varsity and JV, and around 14 for the freshman squad, but that figures to elevate by about 4 players or so this season. Yet, the dreaded “turk” will come for some.
 “We’ll have to make cuts, which is always something that you hate to have to do, but it is part of it,” Hein said. “Again, we’ll be honest with the kids and tell them what they need to work on and encourage them to keep working to improve.
 “It’s really nice to be back out there. I think the kids are happy to be getting it started, and we hope we get to keep it going.”

Can you guess the first game I played on the Xbox Series S? It wasn't Assassin's Creed Valhalla or Watch Dogs: Legion. It was Kingdom Hearts.
 It's not because I had a burning desire to once again rescue the Seven Princesses of Heart. The games CNET was sent for review weren't yet activated, so to test the Xbox Series S I decided to find something on Microsoft's subscription service, Game Pass. It's a perfect metaphor for what the Series S is all about.
 Launching on Tuesday, the Xbox Series S is a smaller, less powerful, cheaper version of the Xbox Series X. Unlike its bigger, bulkier sibling, it has no disk drive and, maxing out at 1440p, can't play games in 4K. But at $300, £250 and AU$499, it's not as expensive as you'd expect a next-generation gaming console to be.

AUGUSTA, Ga.
 Sergio Garcia pulled out of the Masters on Monday after informing Augusta National he tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the second player to withdraw following a positive test.
 Garcia won his only major at the Masters three years ago in his 19th appearance, the most of any player before winning a green jacket.
 "After 21 years of not missing a major championship, I will sadly miss the Masters this week," he tweeted. "The important thing is that my family and I are feeling good. We'll come back stronger and give the green jacket a go next April."
 Joaquin Niemann of Chile announced last week that he tested positive and withdrew.
 The field was down to 92 players, with two other former champions not playing. Angel Cabrera, who won in 2009, had surgery on his left arm and is not expected to return until January. Trevor Immelman, the 2008 winner, had his name listed on the board as not playing. He is working the CBS broadcast this week. Immelman did not immediately respond to a text message from The Associated Press seeking comment.

So this is where the gray part comes in. I had played in those two games in the first two games that I had knelt. I think that was in October. So we had a November camp and I was coming off of an injury. So I wasn't really at my best, but I was clearly on the way back to my best. We just won the World Cup, I was a big part of that team. And I think it was all signs relating to I was going to be coming back and playing back to my best, but I just needed time. And so that was sort of used as an excuse. ... I was left off the next roster and the next roster. So it just was one of those things where it's like I think they were like, if you just sort of fade off into the distance, we'd be happy with that. I never lost my contract. But no, they did not really allow me back on the field until the rule was instituted that you had to stand for the national anthem during our games. So I felt like I was pushed out and not allowed to play purposely because I knelt.
