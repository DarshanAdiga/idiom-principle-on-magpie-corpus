But during his 12-year NFL tenure Flutie played with both Brees (2001-04 with San Diego) and Brady (2005 with New England).
 "I think at the quarterback position you can do that because as time goes on it becomes more about your head, being smart and decision-making," Flutie said during a telephone interview. "That's why I think a guy like Brady, who it's all about smarts and his arm, could play as long as he wants to.
 "I can still throw the ball 55 yards and I could never throw it over 65 yards. So what I'm saying is as long as they have their arm, especially when you're spreading people out, these guys can play for a long time."
 The six-foot, 209-pound Brees began his NFL career in '01 with San Diego and it didn't take Flutie long to realize the youngster's star potential.
 "Drew is definitely a true leader," Flutie said. "He's a guy who when he took over as the starter began having offensive linemen over at his house one night a week.
 "He'd do all those little things a leader does to get everyone motivated and on the same page."
 And Brees did more than just talk the talk.
 "He was one of the first guys I was around who went and got his blood tested and found out what his system handled well and not so well to be at optimal health," Flutie said. "He went as a rookie (being) one of the guys who could fall asleep in a meeting and then all of a sudden in the second year whatever nutrition he was on, he just was sharp as a tack all the time.
 "He always had the smarts and work ethic. I wish I'd figured that part of it out early on in my career because you have good and bad days. It was like all of a sudden Drew was on all the time."
 Brees joined the Saints as a free agent in 2006 and led the franchise to its first-ever Super Bowl victory, a 31-17 decision over the Indianapolis Colts, on Feb. 7, 2010. But to Flutie, the 13-time Pro Bowler is the ultimate competitor.
 "We'd compete in every little thing we did," he said. "We'd drop kick, we'd throw the ball at the crossbar or make up some kicking game.
 "The question mark, especially back then, was size-wise he was barely six foot, if six foot, and everybody saw that as a question mark. Obviously, I never considered that, but because he got to New Orleans and a system where they spread people out, that became even less of a factor."

Much like how the five-foot-10, 181-pound Flutie was able to effectively erase questions about his height playing three-down football on the longer, wider Canadian field.
 "It's more about being accurate with the football than having a cannon of an arm," Flutie said. "Not that Drew didn't, because he has a very strong arm, but it's all about being smart, taking a quick read and the ball is out."
 Flutie said Brady is also driven to constantly prove doubters wrong. New England selected Brady in the sixth round, No. 199 overall, in the 2000 NFL draft.
 "Tom thrives on having something to prove," Flutie said. "He still feels like he's proving himself and it's really because of where he was drafted and all that.
 "You need something like that which motivates your on a daily basis. To Tom, it's the fact that they didn't think he was a top draft choice, they didn't think he was going to do what he's doing."
 Now that Brady is with Tampa Bay, Flutie said he'll be motivated to prove he can also succeed there.
 "I don't know if it's a chip anymore, but it's more another reason to be driven," Flutie said. "It's going to be real strange (seeing Brady in Buccaneers uniform).
 "I've texted Tom back and forth a few times and it seems like he's really excited. It's like a new challenge for him, it's like rekindling the fire. Not that he's ever had an issue with being competitive and having that fire."
 Although they spent just one season together, it was more than enough time for Flutie to see what made Brady tick.
 "He was already Tom Brady," Flutie said. "But he was still meticulous about trying to get better every day.
 "One thing that stood out to me was Tom always felt the more straight over the top he was with his delivery the more accurate he was with the ball. So when you watch him warm up . . . he's very deliberate in tucking in his left elbow and bringing his right arm straight over the top and does it very deliberately to reinforce it to him."
 And the three-time NFL MVP isn't above studying others.
 "When I got there, for my size I had a very strong arm and Tom marvelled at it," Flutie said. "One day I caught him watching film of me trying to figure out like, 'What the hell is Doug doing?' Basically he was saying, 'How can I get two more miles an hour on my fastball.' I never taught Tom anything, it's just that he'd do that type of stuff."

Plan A, Plan B, Plan C and Plan D.
 That's the mantra of Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillivray. Having already faced nearly every possible crisis in the event management business, McGillivray knows you need to have a back-up plan to your back-up plan in order to have something lined up for nearly every contingency. Yes, nearly every contingency.
 Welcome to the 2020 version of "never saw that coming" and that's the coronavirus pandemic. But imaginable or not, it was the responsibility of McGillivray and the folks at the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) to wrestle with a solution to this crisis that would be fair, safe and realistic. The current plan calls for "Boston in the Fall," which will be held on Sept. 14. The 124th edition was supposed to be held on April 20.
 But the Boston Marathon isn't the only event struggling with this crisis. The first to cancel was the Tokyo Marathon; then the Great Wall Marathon; Rome canceled; London postponed to Oct. 4; Flying Pig postponed to Oct. 11; Paris postponed to Oct. 18; and Barcelona postponed to Oct. 25. By St. Patrick's Day, virtually every local race was canceled or postponed as the "stay at home" advisories were issued, and now even the venerable Summer Olympics are postponed at least for a year.
 So, runners just like McGillivray, also had to develop a Plan A, B, C and D.
 For those who planed to run in a spring marathon, weeks of intensive training were already in the books. But the likelihood there will be a replacement event in the near future appears slim. Ongoing training is compromised with the closure of gyms and the social distancing limitations of coached workouts.
 Realizing the full impact upon training regimens has led most runners to go through the five stages of "runner's grief."
 First is denial. When the suggestion was made that there was a possibility of canceling Boston and other running events, Facebook was filled with disbelief that this could even be considered, because after all isn't running a healthy activity?
 Then, there's anger. The question was raised by many, on how dare race directors consider eliminating events after they put in months of preparation.
 Bargaining and depression came next. The ban on these events must be for only international level events, right? Let's find a more local spring marathon. Surely, the Vermont City Marathon, for example, will be fine. Depressingly, all options began to disappear.
 Here we are now at the acceptance stage, and with acceptance has come a realization of how fortunate runners are to have an outlet to help alleviate the stress of this crisis. Perhaps large group runs are off limits, but I see scores and scores of runners and walkers throughout the day either running alone or in small groups that are six-feet apart to adapt to the new norms that were created to slow down the spread of this coronavirus.
 As a fellow runner, I have found one of the blessings this current circumstance has gifted us is the opportunity to change the focus of our runs. Training is taking a backseat to mindful running.
 For the time being, race pace is irrelevant. Weekly mileage is not critical. Now is a great time to fully immerse into the joys of running by opening up all our senses. Rather than concentrating on our smart watches that remind us how far, how fast and how many steps we've earned, we can now enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of spring.
 My runs during these past few weeks have been a joy, as I explore new routes, while seeing so many folks who now have the time to go for a walk with spouses and children, and not worry about how fast they get it done.
 This crisis we now face will end at some point. In the meantime, however, we have been granted a unique opportunity to relieve stress, get outdoors and enjoy whatever the weather delivers, while recognizing the gift of a healthy lifestyle.
 So, whether you are a finely tuned competitive runner, a modest racer, a novice jogger or a walker, get outside and enjoy this opportunity of guilt- free pleasure.
 Stay well and wash your hands!

The robot would supposedly use microphones, biometric and motion sensors, motors, and cameras to analyse a person’s emotions and behaviours, and then react accordingly. The patent says the robot could potentially identify various emotions such as joy, anger, love, and surprise based on how you react to content or even the robot itself. For instance, according to the patent, if you take your dandy time charging the robot after it’s notified you, the robot will take that to mean that you don’t love it and that in turn may result in the robot being less likely to cheer you on when you play games. That also applies to if you kick the robot as opposed to petting it, or tell it to be quiet when it interacts with you. Though, why would anyone be so mean???

Moyes' 10-month reign as manager came to an end on Tuesday after United's hierarchy decided to sack him after a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has left the club languishing in seventh position.
 The final straw proved to be Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, a result that crushed United's hopes of qualifying for next season's UEFA Champions League, with fourth-placed Arsenal 13 points clear with four matches remaining.
 Upon his arrival at Old Trafford, Moyes disposed of Meulensteen, assistant Mike Phelan and goalkeeping coach Eric Steele.
 The Scot replaced the trio with assistant Steve Round, first-team coach Jimmy Lumsden and goalkeeping coach Chris Woods, while former United defender Phil Neville arrived as a coach.
 And Moyes' decision to change United's winning backroom staff despite warnings not to, cost the former Everton head coach his job, according to Meulensteen.
 "David ignored the solid advice given to him by many of the staff in place at the time and opted to put his own plans in place, which he’s entitled to do but it backfired on him a little bit," Meulensteen told US radio station _SiriusXM_.
 "I always strongly believe that performances and results are a reflection of what is happening behind the doors. That wasn't good enough.
 "Don't forget that Moyes was a respected manager over 11 years at Everton, but I tried to warn him: 'You do realise that, with all respect to Everton, you're going from a yacht to a cruise liner, and that’s how big the difference will be?'
 "It's everything that surrounds the club – the players, the pressure, the performances. I think he’s underestimated that and unfortunately it's cost him his position."
 Meulensteen, who went on to manage Russian outfit Anzhi Makhachkala and Fulham following his departure from Manchester, is stunned by the speed of United's decline.
 The fallen Premier League giants are 23 points adrift of leaders Liverpool, while they will be absent from the Champions League for the first time in 19 years.
 "It's really too crazy for words that we are talking about this," the 50-year- old said.
 "I've been part of the United backroom staff under Ferguson in the last five years that has proven to be the most successful period in the club's history.
 "To now have a really poor season, dropping to seventh in the league table, out of the Champions League suddenly after so many years of constant success, that’s probably why the decision has been made.
 "Even before Moyes had the job, I still think United had a fantastic squad with fantastic players."

The beleaguered Welsh side were hammered 4-0 by fellow strugglers Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Sunday, a defeat which saw them replace Gus Poyet's men at the foot of the table.
 In-form striker Connor Wickham opened the scoring and was then brought down by Juan Cala late in the first half, with the Spanish defender being sent off for the incident.
 Fabio Borini tucked way the resultant penalty, despite Cardiff protests, and further goals from Wickham and Emanuele Giaccherini sealed three precious points for the hosts.
 Cardiff are two points adrift of safety with matches against Newcastle United and Chelsea to come, and Solskjaer acknowledged his side are up against it, despite remaining positive.
 "The effort and attitude was there for everyone to see. We go into the next two matches knowing we have to win those two," Solskjaer said.
 "It's a great challenge for everyone at the club. We need two strong performances. The most we can get is 36 points and, if we can get that, I think that will be enough to keep us up.
 "We've given ourselves a mountain to climb and we need to start climbing."
 The former Manchester United striker refused to be drawn on his opinion on Cala's dismissal following a defeat that he admits could relegate them.
 "Going in at half time 2-0 down made it very hard for us," he added.
 "But I don't want to talk about the decision because it's been made and there is absolutely nothing I can say to change that.
 "It could (send us down) but I don't want to comment on the decision. It's the result that matters and we lost."

Though focused on Adèle and Lottie, the novel takes in the broader scope of apartheid, which left no one unscathed — including the oppressors. An important subplot in the book involves an Afrikaans farmer whose land abuts Keziah Christian Academy. Mr. Bosman is as poor as many of the academy students, but he wields his white privilege as a weapon against all incursions. “Poor white people were just often hanging on to that privilege because it was all they had,” says Nunn. “They had terrible lives and took it out on black people. There were just layers of suffering everywhere, with everybody.”
 Nunn feels sympathy even for those who made their fortunes off apartheid. “When I see very rich white South Africans who come to Australia: ‘Well, you’ve escaped.’ But somehow, I hope at some point, you take stock of who you are and how your money was made. I hope you have some grace about it. But I doubt it.”
 Nunn is grateful that her family too escaped, including her aunt, the real- life Lottie, who went to a reunion at the Christian school a couple of years ago. “I said to my aunt, was it really hard?” Nunn remembers. “And she said ‘Malla, I loved it. You know why? Because I live in Australia. I have a daughter who works at Apple and a grandson in law school. I walked in there and I used to be one of the poorest kids, with holes in my shoes. And I felt like God may not come when you want him, but he’s always right on time.’”

Wesley Sneijder scored the only goal of the game with a clinical finish after just nine minutes at Galatasaray's Turk Telekom Arena as Roberto Mancini's side cut the gap to Fenerbahce to seven points.The visitors' hopes of getting anything out of Sunday's game were not helped when midfielder Emre Belozoglu was sent off for a second bookable offence five minutes before half-time.
 Galatasaray's Felipe Melo also saw red three minutes from time and referee Bulent Yildirim dished out 14 yellow cards in a lively encounter, which resulted in the home side ending a run of five games without a win in all competitions.
 Defeat for Ersun Yanal's charges ensured Fenerbahce's run of four consecutive wins came to an end and it could have been worse for them if the impressive Didier Drogba had not been denied by the woodwork.
 Besiktas are level on points with Mancini's men after their 2-1 victory over bottom-of-the-table Kayserispor on Saturday.
 Olcay Sahan put Besiktas in front two minutes before half-time and a further strike from Oguzhan Ozyakup in the second half ensured Okay Yokuslu's stoppage-time strike was merely a consolation for the relegation-threatened visitors.
 Kayseri Erciyesspor moved out of the drop zone by brushing aside fellow- strugglers Elazigspor with a ruthless first-half display to secure a 3-0 victory on Sunday.
 All three goals came before the break with Edinho, Senijad Ibricic and Yasin Oztekin on target to secure three precious points, which moved Kayseri Erciyesspor above their opponents and Antalyaspor.
 Rizespor were unable to move further clear of the bottom three as they were consigned to a 1-0 defeat at Karabukspor.
 That victory moved Karabukspor up to fourth spot, until they were replaced by Trabzonspor on Monday after Cemil Canalioglu's side beat Genclerbirligi 3-0.

Reports in the British press had claimed a high-intensity intra-club practice match last week was marred by several dangerous tackles, which led to a six man punch-up.
 But Swansea dismissed the fight as something that happens at clubs 'up and down the country' and declared the Premier League outfit had already 'moved on'.
 "These things often happen on training grounds up and down the country, so despite the media reports, Swans fans shouldn't be concerned," a Swansea spokesman told the South Wales Evening Post.
 "The squad had just returned to training on the back of a disappointing defeat at Hull and their frustration at not getting the result they wanted boiled over during a full 11 v 11 practice match between the group.
 "Yes, there were a couple of incidents between certain players, which the club does not condone yet understands. They were quickly dealt with and everyone moved on."
 Rumours of infighting and squad unrest have swirled around Swansea for most of the season with defender Chico Flores having allegedly threatened Garry Monk during Michael Laudrup's tenure as manager.
 Monk, now interim manager, had organised the practice match last week in an attempt to help his team get over their 1-0 loss at Hull on April 5, which saw the Welsh club drop closer to the relegation zone.
 Swansea's battling loss to Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday, after Flores was sent off in the 16th minute, saw Monk's side finish the weekend just three points clear of 18th-placed Fulham, who occupy the third relegation spot.
 "We are in a difficult position in the league and everyone wants to secure top-flight status for the club as soon as possible," Swansea's spokesman said.
 "There are a lot of winners within the squad and they want to finish the job. You only have to look at the commitment and effort they put in against Chelsea on Sunday with just 10 men to see that.
 "It certainly looked like a team that was fighting for each other rather than against each other - as is being suggested in some quarters."

 "I want Pjanic and Lulic before the end of the season.
 "As everyone knows, our preparations begin on May 15, and by that time I want all the players that are going to the tournament with me."
 Roma may be certain to finish no higher or lower than second ahead of that trip to Genoa, while ninth-placed Lazio could be out of the running for a European place ahead of their clash against Bologna.

 "Nemanja has been here a long time and produced so many great performances and won a lot of trophies," Smalling told United's club magazine.
 "He's set the benchmark in terms of being a real defensive force and, although it won't be easy, we'll do our best to fill that void.
 "One thing he has always told me is 'defend first'.
 "When you're defending, it's always nice to clear a ball by playing it out with a nice pass or set us away on an attack, but at the end of the day you're a defender and your job, first and foremost, is to defend.
 "Therefore, you have to stop whoever you're playing against, no matter what."

The result means Stuttgart remain in danger, five points clear of Hamburg in the relegation play-off place ahead of the latter facing Augsburg on Sunday.
 Although frustrated by the stalemate at the HDI-Arena, Stevens was pleased with his side's efforts against a Hannover side who came into the game on the back of successive wins.
 "When you play the way we played, then really you deserve more than just the one point," he told the club's official website.
 "Unfortunately we were unable to reward ourselves for (our) effort.
 "We now have two further finals ahead of us and we need to go into those matches with the same attitude we displayed against Hannover."
 Stuttgart sporting director Fredi Bobic was surprised by the approach of Hannover.
 "Hannover merely wanted the point, which could be clearly seen by how deeply they stood at the back," he explained.
 "We just weren't determined enough and thus failed to take the three points.
 "For an away match, we actually played quite well. Our direct opponents play on Saturday and Sunday. We need to keep the pressure on and get a home win against VfL Wolfsburg next week."

How much money is required? No one can know for sure, but the starting point for arriving at a number must be the view that the International Monetary Fund is way off the mark in its forecast that economic growth for India this year will be 1.9 per cent. The reason for scepticism is that the Fund has a long history of optimistic forecasts that are then corrected downwards. This year looks to be no different. There is a definite possibility that, far from recording growth, the Indian economy will shrink this year. Consider that about half of what constitutes the gross domestic product (GDP) is hors de combat, so to speak: manufacturing, construction, transport and trade, the financial sector on the lending side, and the entertainment/hospitality businesses. The numbers for March show electricity consumption is down 25 per cent, unemployment has trebled to 24 per cent, and exports are down 35 per cent. These numbers speak of devastation. Finally, bear in mind that China has just reported 6.8 per cent shrinkage of GDP for the latest quarter. In such circumstances, we should be surprised if India records growth.

Adding to retailers' woes, consumer spending is on the decline, as many as discretionary income takes a nosedive thanks to rising unemployment rates. More than 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the last four weeks, bringing the national jobless rate to 13.5%, according to the most recent data from the US Department of Labor.
 In an attempt to cut costs, department stores and mall brands alike are seeking ways to reduce loss. Gap and H&M, for example, both halted orders of spring and summer apparel. Others have turned to e-commerce promotions to bring in some sales, though online orders account for just a small fraction of sales for large department stores like JCPenney and Macy's, Zimmermann said.
 "COVID-19 has demonstrated how vulnerable the traditional retail model is and highlighted the importance of e-commerce for any retailer," she said. "It will also force retailers to rethink the relationship with their brick and mortar locations, and how to creatively utilize them beyond sales."
 Ultimately, only time will tell what fates will befall these companies, but there's no doubt that department stores are in peril. An analysis this week from S&P Global Market Intelligence identified 15 department stores and apparel companies as among the "most vulnerable public American retailers." In addition to JCPenney, this list includes mall brand conglomerates like Tailored Brands, L Brands, and Ascena Group, as well as companies like Vince and The Children's Place.

 Willie Davis, a Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive lineman who helped the Green Bay Packers win each of the first two Super Bowls, has died. He was 85.
   
 The Packers confirmed Davis' death to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Wednesday, as did his former teammate and fellow hall member, Dave Robinson.
   
 Davis died in a Santa Monica, California hospital. His wife, Carol, told the Packers her husband had been hospitalized for about a month with kidney failure and passed away peacefully.
   
 "The Green Bay Packers family was saddened today to learn about the passing of Willie Davis," said Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy. "One of the great defensive players of his era, Willie was a significant contributor to the Packers' five NFL championship teams during the 1960s.
   
 "I enjoyed getting to know Willie and his wife, Carol, especially when he served as our honorary captain for the 2010 NFC championship game and Super Bowl 45, and again for the 2014 NFC championship game. He also was a great role model for our players, having gone on to a very successful career after football and serving on the Packers Board of Directors."
   
 A 15th-round draft pick from Grambling, Davis began his NFL career by playing both offense and defense for the Cleveland Browns in 1958 and '59. He had his greatest success after getting traded to the Packers.
   
 He remained with the Packers until finishing his NFL career in 1969 as a five- time All-Pro. Although tackles and sacks weren't measured at the time Davis played, his 22 career fumble recoveries showcased his dominance and big-play ability.
   
 He was voted to the NFL's all-decade team for the 1960s and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1981.
   
 "There were few players in the league who were as tough as Willie," Packers Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr said in the foreword to Davis' book, "Closing The Gap: Lombardi, the Packers Dynasty and the Pursuit of Excellence. "He was at his best in games in which we struggled. When it was tough, he rose to the top and took our defensive people right along with him."
   
 Davis helped the Packers win the NFL championship in 1965 before capping the 1966 and 1967 seasons with titles in the first two Super Bowls.
   
 But he didn't initially embrace the move to Green Bay.
   
 Davis noted in his book that he had just signed a contract with the Browns and believed he was being groomed as Cleveland's future starting left tackle on offense when he learned about the trade on the radio. Green Bay acquired Davis in a July 1960 trade that sent wide receiver A.D. Williams to Cleveland.
   
 "At the time, I felt slightly betrayed," Davis wrote in his book. "I felt the organization didn't care much about me, like I was being thrown away. I also panicked, wondering what this would mean for my future. I absolutely did not want to play in Green Bay. In fact, I was so turned off by the idea that my first thought was about retiring."
   
 He instead stuck it out and developed into one of the top defensive linemen of his era.
   
 "Willie's extraordinary athleticism was an undeniable factor in Green Bay's winning tradition of the 1960s under coach Vince Lombardi," Hall of Fame President David Baker said. "He helped the Packers through an unprecedented championship run and to two Super Bowl victories. Willie was a man of true character on and off the field. The Hall of Fame will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration to future generations."
   
 In an NFL Films tribute to Davis, former Packers center Bill Curry called him "the finest combination of leader and player that I ever saw." In that same tribute, former Packers offensive lineman and Hall of Fame member Forrest Gregg said that "I can't ever remember a football game that he played in where I didn't think Willie Davis played absolutely the best he could possibly play that day.''
   
 Davis forced a Johnny Unitas fumble to help seal the Packers' 1966 Western Conference championship, and he tormented Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson and Raiders quarterback Daryle Lamonica in the first two Super Bowls.
   
 "He put as much fear in me, because of what he could do and his abilities, as any defensive end that I had to face," Dawson told NFL Films.
   
 Davis earned a master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago late in his NFL career, which helped him make a successful transition to the business world after he stopped playing.
   
 "We all knew football wasn't going to last forever," Davis wrote in his book. "The longevity of the average football player was less than 10 years, and that meant there were many men who were jobless with little financial security by the time they were in their early 30s. That was a scary prospect. I wanted to make sure I didn't fall into that category."
   
 Davis served on the boards of directors for several companies, including Dow Chemical Co., Sara Lee Corp., Schlitz Brewing and Mattel Toys. He also on the Packers' board of directors from 1994-2005.
   
 His debut in the NFL was delayed by military service.
   
 "I got drafted immediately after my first preseason camp and had to serve in the military for two years," he wrote in his book. "After bouncing around from base to base and playing football for the army, I left the military a stronger, more focused and mature man."
   
 "Along the way, there were key moments at each stage, key opportunities that, when I took full advantage of them, propelled me to the next level," Davis also wrote. "I had some slip-ups along the way, but when it mattered, when it was important, I stepped up, practiced what I believed, took the advice of those I respected and went for it with everything I could give. That's how I succeeded in football, business and beyond."

Augsburg stunned Bundesliga champions Bayern 1-0 on Saturday to end a four- game winless streak and maintain their bid for a spot in the UEFA Europa League next season.
 The victory was Augsburg's first ever league triumph over Bayern with the 106-year-old club having only reached the Bundesliga for the first time at the end of the 2010-11 season.
 Up against their Bavarian rivals, Augsburg's fans provided the impetus for the small club, which is situated less than 70 kilometres north-west of Munich, to shock their more-fancied opponents at the SGL Arena.
 "We can be more than proud of ourselves," Ostrzolek said after the game.
 "Even before the game there was a spine-tingling atmosphere and the fans really got behind us.
 "We applied ourselves to the game and deservedly took the lead. You could see that as a team we're capable of playing at that level."
 Augsburg started strongly against an experimental Bayern line-up with Ostrzolek flashing a shot just past the post in only the second minute.
 More chances followed for the home side in the opening half hour and they deservedly hit the front in the 31st minute when Sascha Molders smashed the ball into the net after a smart pass from Daniel Baier.
 While Bayern got back into the contest in the second half with David Alaba hitting the post for the champions, Augsburg held on for victory to the delight of their coach Markus Weinzierl and even could have doubled their lead late-on as they also struck the woodwork.
 "We fought brilliantly and tried to work as a team to neutralise Bayern's strengths," Weinzierl said.
 "Taking the lead was great for us. We were able to be more compact after that and rely on our ability to switch play.
 "Bayern stepped it up in the second half. We had the little bit of luck you need. Everything went right for us. At the end of the day we're very, very happy."
 In the lead-up to Saturday's game, Bayern coach Pep Guardiola had declared the Bundesliga was 'over' for the Bavarian giants and, despite the loss, goalkeeper Manuel Neuer reiterated that sentiment after the match.
 "We took Augsburg seriously but the main thing for us was that nobody got injured today," Neuer said.
 "That's the crucial point. It's all about Wednesday and the (UEFA Champions League) match against Manchester United. Nothing else matters."
 The win took Augsburg to 42 points in eighth in the Bundesliga, just five points adrift of Wolfsburg, who occupy sixth and hold the second UEFA Europa League berth in Germany.

 "It has been a privilege and an honour to represent Sydney FC for nine seasons and I have felt immense pride every time I have pulled on the sky blue shirt," he said in a statement.
 "I have had some fantastic times and been part of some incredible moments in Sydney FC's history which I will never forget, and I would like to thank everyone at the club for giving me the opportunity to experience them.
 "Sydney FC will always have a special place in my heart and I've made lots of lifelong friends both on and off the field through this great club. I'll always be thankful to the club for that opportunity."
 Sydney defeated Wellington 4-1 at home on Sunday to close in on a top-six berth.
 They will need to impress in the finals to avoid the season being remembered for dressing room unrest involving Matt Thompson and Nick Carle, as well as virulent fan discontent being directed at Farina and chairman Scott Barlow.

Across the country, people have been eagerly checking their local store shelves for necessary supplies and groceries, while they stay quarantined at home from the COVID-19 pandemic. Behind the scenes, truck drivers have been hauling that valuable freight with a new sense of pride.
 "They're being kind of the unsung heroes and going to get the freight to deliver critical medical supplies," said FreightWaves reporter Clarissa Hawes.
 While truck drivers nationwide continue to work, many are concerned about their safety. Online logistics publication FreightWaves recently put out a survey to see how drivers were being treated during this time.
 "There were 130 motor carriers that took the survey and it ranged from CEOs to the director of operations and drivers," explained Hawes.
 Survey results showed 55 percent reported their drivers have seen closed truck stops while out delivering supplies. Roughly 76 percent said they've seen closed rest stops. Clarissa Hawes says these rest and truck stops are crucial for drivers who are sometimes on the road for weeks at a time. They rely on these facilities for bathrooms and showers.
 "Then, it's the hand washing and not having access to that as well," said Hawes.
 FreightWaves also surveyed drivers on treatment shipping and receiving facilities. Some, like driver Thomas Mitchell who took a photo of a sign warning drivers to stay far away, are being locked out of offices amid the coronavirus pandemic. Others are finding they're being treated better than before. Driver Wayne Cragg recently picked up a load of toilet paper.
 "They had just for us truckers--one thing of toilet paper if we needed it and wipes,” Cragg said. “So, Kimberly Clarke was saying 'Thank you, truckers!'"
 Still, the biggest issue for truck drivers is the lack of protective gear, such as masks hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. Even at truck stops, they're finding supplies sold out and many are worried--as they deliver to COVID-19 hot spots around the country--that they're not being shielded properly from the virus themselves.

The two La Liga high-fliers met in the first leg of a quarter-final encounter on Tuesday, and the visitors appeared set to take a one-goal advantage back to Vicente Calderon thanks to Diego's 25-yard screamer in the second half.
 However, Brazil international Neymar ensured next week's return fixture will begin with the score reading 1-1, collecting a sublime throughball from Andres Iniesta before finding the net with a curled finish.
 Diego had started the game on the bench but replaced forward Diego Costa, who had to depart early due to an apparent hamstring complaint.
 Simeone paid tribute to the midfielder and felt both sides deserved credit for the way they approached the tie.
 "I'm really happy for Diego and for the goal he scored. He needed that. He came on at a very important moment." said Simeone.
 "It was a beautiful game. Each team played to their strengths and stayed true to their style."
 Atletico - who currently lead reigning champions Barcelona by one point at the top of La Liga - will have the advantage of an away goal for the return leg.
 Midfielder Tiago expressed satisfaction at Atleti's display, but believes Gerardo Martino's men remain favourites to reach the semi-finals.

Cardiff's hopes of avoiding an immediate return to the Championship were dealt a further blow on Saturday as they went down 3-0 to Crystal Palace.
 Afterwards, Solskjaer acknowledged his side, who sit six points from safety with only five games to play, require "a miracle" if they are to avoid relegation.
 However, the Norwegian insists he will not throw in the towel, having taken increased motivation from Cardiff's struggles since he was appointed in January.
 "I'm full of fight. I've been here three months and I've got more energy than ever and more fight in me than ever," he said.
 "Every time when I was put on the bench (as a player) that galvanised me and this situation galvanises me as a manager.
 "Things like this give me more fight. Things will have to happen, things will have to change and I think whoever feels those changes will know why."
 Cardiff travel to eighth-placed Southampton on Saturday, with Mauricio Pochettino's men having run out 3-0 winners in December's reverse fixture.
 Solskjaer is keen to gain a measure of revenge for the defeat but aware that could be a difficult ask against a team who have impressed this season.
 "They're professional footballers and we've got to go out there - we've still got something to fight for and (the squad) have got to realise that," he added.
 "If you do produce a miracle against Southampton, suddenly you might be back here in with a chance.
