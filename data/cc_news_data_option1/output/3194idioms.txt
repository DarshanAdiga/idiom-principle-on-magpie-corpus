The Pittsburgh Steelers’ ground game wasn’t up to snuff last season, for a variety of reasons, including injuries to each of their top three backs. Entering 2020, they actually return _five_ running backs who ended the previous season on the 53-man roster, and to that group they have added yet another running back in the draft, with fourth-round pick Anthony McFarland. Since training camp opened, they have also signed veteran Wendell Smallwood, giving them seven in total.

Six former Environmental Protection Agency chiefs are calling for an agency reset after President Donald Trump’s regulation-chopping, industry-minded first term, backing a detailed plan by former EPA staffers that ranges from renouncing political influence in regulation to boosting climate-friendly electric vehicles.
 Most living former EPA heads joined in Wednesday’s appeal, with Trump’s first EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, being the notable exception. The group — William Reilly, Lee Thomas, Carol Browner, Christine Todd Whitman, Lisa Jackson and Gina McCarthy — served under Republican and Democratic presidents.
 The Environmental Protection Network, a bipartisan group of more than 500 former EPA senior managers and employees, crafted the hundreds of pages of recommendations for a change of course at the agency.

Ford’s investigation brings him face to face with members of Strait’s dysfunctional family, including the menacing family patriarch and a sister whose legal marijuana-growing business has brought her into violent conflict with a Mexican drug cartel.

If all you saw were the highlights of how Collin Morikawa beat back the biggest names in golf and walked off with the PGA Championship, you’d conclude he did it the old-fashioned way.          The 23-year-old Californian delivered a 6-under 64 in the final round, including a signature shot that fans will be talking about for decades. He hit more fairways and greens, and picked up more strokes with the putter over four days than anyone else in the field. He even arrived at TPC Harding Park with some built-in advantages, in top form after winning twice on tour during this re-jiggered season, and he knew the course well from his days playing college golf at nearby Cal-Berkeley.          He parlayed all that into a two-shot victory Sunday over third-round leader Dustin Johnson and Paul Casey. Two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka talked a good game, but crashed in his effort to three-peat with an uncharacteristic closing 74.

Much of the land in Greene County has rich history. The land on which Greene Hills Club was created in 1967 is no exception. Recently, two members decided to uncover some of that history, literally.
 There is an old chimney not far from the old farmhouse where the Pro Shop resides. It has been covered with ivy for many years, and most members paid little attention to the spot just beyond the ninth green. Bobby Poole decided to tackle the job of uncovering the chimney, and his friend Steve Lawson joined him to help restore the stonework of the chimney. As they removed the ivy and put stones back in place, they found the foundation for a rectangular- shaped building, with the chimney on one of the short ends.
 Now, there were questions. What had this been, and what happened to it? That’s when Henry Powell of Somerset came to the club to consult with the members about this building. Powell’s family resided on the farm from 1943-60. Marvin Powell, Henry’s father, was the farm manager at Cloverly Farm, which was owned by Williston (Bill) Clover, of Clover Realty in Charlottesville. He said he remembered this building quite well. It was a two-story log cabin with a dugout cellar underneath where the bulls were taken to be fed. To enter the cabin, you walked up a few steps on the left side of the building, into a room where the chimney was located. An opening in the floor of that room allowed Marvin Powell to drop hay down into a trough in the cellar and four bulls could eat side by side in that space. They referred to this building as The Bull House. It is possible that the building was a little longer than it appears now, but time and the ravages of nature have changed many things about it.

Truman Everts went missing on the Yellowstone Plateau on September 9, 1870. A member of an exploration party sent by the federal government to catalog the region's natural wonders, Everts, at first, took getting lost in stride. A romantic, he was enthralled by Yellowstone's magnificent scenery. As hours turned to days and days to weeks, however, his outlook darkened. Two hunters found him on October 16. From a distance, they thought he was a bear, but the closer they got, the more confused they became. "When I got near it," recalled one in the _Helena Daily Herald_ on October 26, 1870, "I found it was not a bear, and for my life I could not tell what it was." Everts was a sight to behold: "His flesh was all gone; the bones protruded through the skin on the balls of his feet and thighs. His fingers looked like bird claws." He seemed "temporarily insane." Later, Everts described holding conversations with imaginary friends in his worst moments of his bewilderment. He eventually recovered in body and mind. Everts abandoned his political career in the West, where he served as the Montana Territory's tax assessor, and settled in Hyattsville, Maryland. He wiled away his final years working for the U.S. Postal Service.

In the same response, he warned that Republicans could lose the Senate because some senators don't support him enough.
 "You have a few people that want to be cute, and I think they're going to lose their elections and that's a problem for the Senate," he said.
 Trump touted his economy, highlighting stock market gains and minimizing the bleak reality of double-digit unemployment, which comes as Capitol Hill negotiators have gone days without talks for a desperately needed stimulus package.
 And he continued to sow doubt in November's election results, saying that Democrats' request for additional United States Postal Service funding are holding up stimulus talks.
 "They want $3.5 billion for something that'll turn out to be fraudulent, that's election money basically. They want $3.5 billion for the mail in votes. Universal mail-in ballots. They want $25 billion, billion, for the post office. Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots," Trump said, falsely claiming that mail-in voting would be "fraudulent."
 While multiple members his own administration have vocally condemned China's crackdown in Hong Kong, including the arrest of activist and media mogul Jimmy Lai, Trump, who frequently ties Biden and other Democrats to socialism, missed an opportunity to advocate for Hong Kong's democracy, instead saying that the US will make "billions and billions" more in the absence of economic incentives for the country.
 "So what does it mean for the United States? It means that our markets are going to make a lot more money," he said, adding that Hong Kong's markets will "go to hell."
 Trump also went after his own FBI director, Christopher Wray, and appeared to pressure Attorney General Bill Barr to influence John Durham's investigation of the Russia probe, with a rambling response.
 He called on Wray to be "more forthcoming" and warned: "Bill Barr has a chance to be the greatest of all time. But if he wants to be politically correct, he'll be just another guy."

In 1928, Jimmy Hale got lost searching for prehistoric relics in the caverns of the Ozark mountains in Arkansas. Hale fancied himself an expert archeologist because he had "read some books," according to a 1928 article in _Forest and Stream_ magazine. He lectured his host and guide, an experienced artifact hunter named Vance Randolph, on woodcraft, critiquing his fire- building skills and correcting his identification of woodpecker species. Two weeks into their trip, Hale left camp to hike "about three miles" through the woods to reach a nearby village and call his girlfriend. Relishing a morning free of Hale's "putrid hokum," Randolph urged him on his way, calling out as he entered the trees: "'Well, don't get lost!'" Hale failed to come back that night. Thinking the lad had decided to bed down in the village, Randolph held off searching for him until noon the next day, when he enlisted the help of a lumberjack named Lem. The searchers found where Hale had slept, a small cavern under a bluff, and in the next hollow, they spotted their man. He was marching along "shaking his head and tossing his arms wildly about." Randolph called to him. Hale turned, glared at his guide without comprehension, and charged him, "frothing and spitting like a wounded wildcat." ." Randolph ducked behind a bush, and the two "played hide-and-seek around a hazel thicket" until Hale spun off alone into the woods. Lem and Randolph discovered him face down in a snowbank a hundred yards away. After pouring corn whiskey down his throat to deaden his nerves, they carried him back to Lem's cabin. The next morning, he remembered only a few details, like crossing his own trail and becoming frightened and running blindly through the forest. Randolph and Lem packed his bags and sent the humbled expert home to Massachusetts.

An Oglala mule brought Jack into a summer camp bustling with Lakotas, fur traders and overland travelers in 1846. He swayed in the saddle, gripping the pommel as if it were the rail of a storm-tossed ship. Oglala Lakota women and children "came pouring out of the lodges" and encircled the animal and its rider. Their "screams and cries" drew more onlookers. Even at rest, Jack rocked and rolled, and his "vacant stare" sent shivers through the crowd. Three Oglala hunters had rescued him after discovering him lying face-down, alone on the plains. He had gone missing 33 days earlier, in early June, while out chasing wayward oxen and horses for his employer, John Baptiste Richard, the "bourgeois," or proprietor, of Fort Bernard, a trading post on the North Platte River in what is now Wyoming.

To put it in a nutshell, the foregoing culminated in Wednesday’s removal of the vice-chancellor. For me, the sad thing is that none of the issues at stake has anything to do with the students, who are the real reasons behind the establishment of the university. Everything is about contracts and money. One may even be tempted to think that the university was simply set up for the purpose of awarding contracts. I might be wrong but I can’t remember a time when UNILAG was so much in the news as it is now over any major breakthrough in recent times. And to think that an academic community that has been unusually silent at a time when the world was creating alternative learning channels for their students in addition to finding a cure for COVID-19, could suddenly gear back to life,  is most amazing. I even learnt that members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) are planning to hold their congress on this same issue.

On July 17, 1939, a 12-year-old Boy Scout named Donn Fendler summited Baxter Peak on Maine's Mount Katahdin with his friend, Henry Condon. The boys had scrambled to the top ahead of their main hiking party, which included their fathers and Donn's two brothers, Tom and Ryan. Clouds rolled in, and droplets of mist collected on Fendler's sweatshirt and thin summer jacket. His teeth chattered, and he grew scared. He decided to backtrack to find his father. The child of an outdoor guide, Condon refused to go along. He hunkered down and waited. Fendler missed the trail and became lost. Nine days later, he stumbled out of the woods, 16 pounds lighter, missing his coat, his pants, his sneakers and the tip of one of his big toes, but clinging to a story of excruciating loneliness that would resonate with millions of people.

More than 1,500 school employees in Pinellas County have requested an alternative work assignment, Texel told the school board. The vast majority of the requests — 1,115 — came from workers who say they are uncomfortable going back to work, but priority is given to employees with underlying medical conditions or who are age 65 and older, she added.          The requests are granted based on availability at each school and certifications, Texel said.          “It is all based on the student responses and the needs of the students at the school,” she said.          The same dynamic is playing out in Pasco County. More teachers will be able to teach remotely if more parents choose online classes for their kids, Hegarty said.          Many teachers have decided to go back to school despite COVID-19 concerns due to financial needs or fear they would be depriving students who opt for in-person learning.          “I honestly feel like in-person school is so important and I fear that if we swing too far where everyone should do online, the state might close brick-and-mortar schools for good,” Eric Rodriguez, a high-school computer-lab teacher in Suwannee County, said Tuesday.          The educator’s commitment to teaching, however, does not erase his coronavirus concerns. Rodriguez said that, while it felt good to be back at work on Monday, the district’s lax face-mask policy is unsettling. He estimated that roughly 40% of individuals at his school wore face coverings early this week.          Finances weighed heavily on Collier County high-school teacher Sarah Ross’ decision to return to work.          “I am the full provider for my family, so it is very hard for me to wrap my mind around walking away from the job and not having any income,” Ross told The News Service of Florida on Tuesday. “I have no idea what I would do. I need to pay the bills.”          Ross, 39, said the district’s decision to require students and staff to wear face masks on campus made her decision easier. In addition to a mask, she plans to wear eye protection and will adhere to a strict routine when she returns home.          “I’m gonna get home and take my shoes off and put my clothes in the washer and go straight to the shower,” she said. “I want to decontaminate before I come in contact with my daughter.”          Galloway, who does not have the comfort of a mask mandate in Jackson County, decided not to retire early because he said the move would have taken a financial toll on his retirement plans.          In addition, Galloway said, his wife is also a teacher and she plans to go back to work full-time next week.          “It’s a bit of a conundrum,” he said. “My risk would have been diminished but it would not be completely eliminated. There’s also the sense that I would be abandoning my wife.”

As I mentioned near the top, not all of your stocks to buy this month have to be focused on preventing doom and gloom. A great example is Lululemon Athletica. Ordinarily, you'd think that a discretionary retail play like LULU stock wouldn't do so well during a pandemic. But a quick glance at its technical chart will prove you wrong.

MADISON — A Watertown man and a Johnson Creek woman are among nine Wisconsin residents granted pardons this week by Gov. Tony Evers.          The Governor’s Pardon Advisory Board heard from applicants virtually on July 21, and the board forwarded its recommendations for pardon to Gov. Evers for final consideration.          “Pardons are more than just a signature on paper; they offer new opportunities, second chances, and forgiveness for folks who have bettered their communities and made amends,” said Evers. “I believe in second chances and in the positive impact pardons can have on our criminal justice system and communities, so I am glad to pardon these nine individuals.”          Among those pardoned was Steven Dummer of Watertown, who was 17 years old when he and his friends stole a vehicle from an auto dealership and took it joyriding.          Now 64, he has maintained employment since and hopes to travel to Canada to fish.          Also pardoned was Heather Hafemann-Biles of Johnson Creek.          She was in her early 20’s when she was struggling with drug addiction and drove the getaway vehicle while her then-husband burglarized multiple residences. She underwent treatment, is now sober and a mother of three, and currently works at a chocolate factory.          The other seven people pardoned had been convicted of crimes including hit-and-run, stealing a vehicle to joy-ride, robbery, stealing alcohol and selling marijuana to an undercover officer. All were young when they committed the crimes.          The Wisconsin Constitution grants the governor the power to pardon individuals convicted of a crime.          A pardon is an official act of forgiveness that restores some of the rights that are lost when someone is convicted of a felony, including the right to serve on a jury, hold public office, and hold certain professional licenses. A pardon does not result in an expungement.          Under Executive Order #30, individuals convicted of a Wisconsin felony may apply for a pardon if they completed their sentence at least five years ago and have not committed any new crimes. Individuals currently required to register on the sex offender registry are ineligible for a pardon.          The Governor’s Pardon Advisory Board will be reconvening again virtually on Aug. 18.

The only 2020 NBA playoffs spot remaining is the Lakers' opponent, the eighth seed in the West, which will be determined by a play-in series Saturday and (if necessary) Sunday. In a unique rule set up just for the NBA restart (because of the shortened season), if the ninth-seed team is within four games of the eighth seed (something that will happen in the West), the eighth and ninth seeds are put into a two-game play-in series. The eighth seed team needs only to win one of those games, the ninth seed needs to sweep both. The winner advances on to face the Lakers.

DeGeneres and de Rossi made their first public appearance together at the HBO Golden Globe Awards Party in January 2005.           Later that year, de Rossi opened up about what it means to be a gay woman in Hollywood in an interview with The Advocate.          "Believe me, I had a very, very long and difficult struggle with my sexuality," she said, which marked the first time she had openly spoken about her sexuality and her relationship with DeGeneres.          She continued, "I didn't choose the fact that I was gay, but I did choose whether to live my life as a gay woman -- that was the terrifying thing for me. Especially being a gay actress. I love playing all different kinds of women, and the majority of women aren't gay, so the majority of characters aren't going to be gay."          Later that year, according to People, DeGeneres and de Rossi moved into a two-bedroom house together in LA.          In DeGeneres' cover-story interview for the magazine, she told the publication, "It's the first time that I've known in every cell of my being that I'm with somebody for the rest of my life."

For instance, lecturers go on strike for months without thinking of the implication on the students.  Though they claim the strikes are aimed at improving the standard of education and infrastructures on the campuses, standards have continued to fall and infrastructures decaying more and more.  University hostels have gone from bad to worse, toilet facilities have not improved, lecture theatres are still overcrowded, many universities don’t have running water- students fetch water from stream, halls of residences are invaded by bedbugs. Somebody shared the picture of a university hostel in Nigeria and that of prison in Norway. The difference is more than clear. Many university libraries are nothing to write home about. In fact, things are going from bad to worse in many of these institutions. You then wonder the benefit of all the so-called industrial actions for the students -nothing. Nigerian students have become the grass that is always suffering when the elephants are fighting. Sometimes the elephants are their lecturers and government or the council and their lecturers-whichever way, they suffer.
