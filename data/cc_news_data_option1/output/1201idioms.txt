G20 leaders will convene a video conference tonight. South Korean President Moon Jae-in suggested it earlier, urging the need for international cooperation to share containment strategies and deal with economic ramifications and other crises. On Monday, G20 finance ministers and central bankers had an emergency video conference, where they agreed to put forward action plans to overcome the coronavirus outbreak.      Given its speed and scope, it has become clear that no country can defeat COVID-19 alone. It took time for countries to realize this, which has been a costly mistake. Nations scrambled to close borders after the virus outbreak, bringing movement of people and goods to a halt, which, in turn, has taken a toll on the economy. The invisible enemy has instilled fear and distrust in us, and governments across the world responded by building barriers and looking inward.      Travel bans might have been inevitable to contain the spread of the virus, but the Trump administration has failed to propose any measures that can counteract the effects of the bans. The global super power that once led concerted efforts, whether it be for a global financial crisis or for a pandemic, was nowhere to be seen. The world was heading towards the era of G0 amid the absence of global leadership and distrust of international institutions      However, the novel coronavirus pandemic, while exposing vulnerabilities of a globally connected, interdependent world, showed us that such a global challenge can only be overcome by working together. Meanwhile, the South Korean presidential office Cheong Wa Dae said President Trump asked President Moon for medical supplies to help combat COVID-19 on a phone call on Monday. This goes to show no country can tackle a crisis alone.      Through such belated realization, world leaders will be reminded of the importance of the global order and liberalism, which have underpinned the world we live in. In the video conference call, G20 leaders should discuss measures to share information, supply medical equipment and develop vaccines together. They should also come up with detailed action plans such as to make certain business trips exempt from travel bans.

"No one can predict every possible outcome of the COVID-19 outbreak particularly with regard to the duration of this crisis and we are managing in the unknown. We have modelled three potential scenarios and are working on an assumption based on a medium term impact with a view to a return to rugby in the autumn. We will continue to monitor against this assumption and review and revise planning where necessary.

“Usually we’ll have 50 governors that will call it the same time. I think we are doing very well. But it’s a two-way street. They have to treat us well, also. They can’t say, “Oh, gee, we should get this, we should get that.” We’re doing a great job. Like in New York where we’re building, as I said, four hospitals, four medical centers. We’re literally building hospitals and medical centers. And then I hear that there’s a problem with ventilators. Well we sent them ventilators. And they could have had 15,000 or 16,000 – all they had to do was order them two years ago. But they decided not to do it. They can’t blame us for that.” Trump today on Fox News

Ironwood Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IRWD) was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a hold rating to a sell rating. The firm currently has $11.00 target price on the stock. According to Zacks, "Ironwood reported encouraging fourth-quarter results, beating estimates on both counts. Linzess has been performing encouragingly on the back of strong demand and expansion in new patient population and geographic regions. Ironwood is focused on further label expansions of the drug. Meanwhile, Ironwood's separation into two companies is increasing operational performance and strategic flexibility. The amendment of agreements related to Linzess rights in China and Japan with its partners is likely to boost margins. Shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. However, competition in Linzess' target markets is intensifying. Any Linzess-related pipeline/regulatory setbacks will weigh heavily on the stock as the rest of its pipeline is mostly mid-stage in nature. Shares have underperformed the industry in the past year."

Solar power pumps are devices that majorly run on electricity generated through photovoltaic cells. These cells mainly collect the incident solar energy, which further gets converted into electric energy through various processes. Solar powered pumps are known to be widely economical in the long run as compared to electrical powered pumps majorly due to less operational costs and low maintenance expenses. Solar powered pumps also have less environmental impact than the pumps that run on electricity. Thus, looking at these advantages, these pumps are gradually being used in a large numbers, thus constituting a distinct solar pumps market from a global perspective.

SLOAN, John Robert September 7, 1956 - March 21, 2020 It is with great sadness that Ralph and Louise announce the passing of their dear son John. Predeceased by his mother Gloria, he will be lovingly missed by his brother Brian (Colleen) and children, Jimy (Kiley), and Myra; his sister Barb (Dean) and children, Ken, Dan, and Kelly.
