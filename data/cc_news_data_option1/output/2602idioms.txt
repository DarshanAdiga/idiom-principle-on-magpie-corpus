ZIMBABWE has enough resources to finance its own development if the right mindsets, as well as institutional and legal frameworks, are put in place, a joint report by organisations that promote socio-economic justice and economic governance has revealed.
 The report compiled by the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development (Zimcodd) in collaboration with the Economic Governance Initiative Consortium in Zimbabwe reveals that the country is too resource-endowed to be poor.
 ". . . a cursory analysis of the natural capital in Zimbabwe, including its mineral resource stocks, wildlife, forestry, fisheries, and arable land, among others, suggests that the country's resources are enough to finance its own development if the right mindsets, conditions, institutional, and legal frameworks are put in place," the report, titled Domestic Resource Mobilisation and the Quest for Sustainable Alternative to External Debt in Zimbabwe, authored by policy analyst and former government minister Gorden Moyo, reads.
 The proven minerals and precious stones in Zimbabwe, according to the report, include 13 million tonnes of gold; 2,8 billion tonnes of platinum; 26 billion tonnes of coal; 10 billion tonnes of chrome; 4,5 million tonnes of nickel; 16,5 million carats of diamonds; 30 billion tonnes of iron ore; 5,2 million tonnes of copper; and 765 billion cubic metres of coal-bed methane.
 "Given this magnitude of natural capital, a well-repurposed approach to domestic revenue mobilisation could harness all these and many other resources to scale up development finance in Zimbabwe without overly relying on erratic external flows," it reads.
 "Government should go beyond the rhetoric of zero tolerance to corruption and adopt drastic measures to curtail illicit financial flows."
 The report says every effort must be made to strengthen all institutions that are involved in the management of illicit financial flows including customs, tax departments, Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission, and all the relevant parliamentary portfolio committees.
 "Stemming capital flight and encouraging the repatriation of capital held abroad will have a very significant impact on the level of resources available for productive investment in Zimbabwe thereby directly contributing towards debt sustainability," it said.
 Among other recommendations, the report says the government should revamp its public finance management systems and align them with the constitution.
 This should aim at promoting a real culture of transparency in the public sector in order to ensure that the budgetary resources result in economic growth and development.
 Government should also urgently adopt innovative financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships, securitisation of diaspora remittances, and sovereign wealth funds, and digitallyenhanced tax administration practices as well as online gaming industries.
 "The successful implementation of these innovative financing mechanisms would provide strong impetus to efforts geared at accelerating accumulation of capital, productivity, and economic growth in the country thereby contributing towards debt sustainability," it said.
 The government should fully embrace the principles of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in tax administration, and in monitoring and tracing financial crimes.
 "Political leaders must have the will to change the current situation in Zimbabwe. The benefits of domestic resource mobilisation will only accrue to the country if the political leadership is prepared to shift its mindset away from aid and debt dependence syndromes."
 "It also depends on whether the government has the political will and capacity to put in place the appropriate policy measures," the report says.

From remote Himalayan valleys to small tropical islands and tense Western capitals, an increasingly assertive China is taking on conflicts around the world like never before as the United States retreats.
 China's imposition this week of a controversial security law in Hong Kong, defying a barrage of criticism from the West, offered another example of its rising confidence as a global superpower.
 The confrontations are seen as part of President Xi Jinping's nationalist drive to return a once-weak China to its rightful place of dominance in the world and shed past strategies of discreet diplomacy.
 They also come as US President Donald Trump alienates allies with his America First policies and riles China with a trade war.
 "There is a sense that the time has come for China to claim its spot under the sun," said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.
 That means meeting the call by Xi to "unsheathe the sword," Tsang said.
 \- Territorial rows -
 The most dramatic flare-up in a trio of territorial rows recently saw 20 Indian troops die in a fight with Chinese soldiers in a disputed part of the Himalayas last month.
 Both sides blamed each other for the brawl, which was the deadliest clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades and sent relations plummeting.
 China has in recent years also stepped up its claims to most of the South China Sea by building artificial islands and establishing a heavy military presence.
 China this week held naval drills near the Paracels, an archipelago in the sea also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan, which stoked tensions further.
 The Pentagon voiced concern over the drills on Thursday, saying they would "further destabilise" the region, while Vietnam lodged a diplomatic protest.
 And in the East China Sea, Japan said Chinese bombers last month flew over uninhabited islands claimed by both after Japanese efforts to rename them.
 \- Diplomatic tensions -
 China has also seen relations with a range of Western nations plummet, as it has adopted increasingly strident diplomatic tactics.
 The coronavirus pandemic initially forced China into a diplomatic corner, as it fought off blame for months after the virus first emerged in the central city of Wuhan last year.
 But, after Western nations failed to control their own outbreaks, China went on the offensive, with Australia one of its main targets.
 Australia enraged China by calling for an investigation into the disease's origins, seen in Beijing as a US-backed attempt to discredit it.
 China in turn slapped trade sanctions on Australian goods and issued a volley of intimidatory comments, drawing accusations in Canberra of economic "coercion".
 China also formally charged two Canadians with espionage last month, more than a year after their detention, in apparent retaliation for the arrest of a top executive of Chinese telecom giant Huawei in Vancouver.
 The failure of Western nations to contain virus outbreaks was a shot in the arm for China's ruling Communist Party (CCP), said Ling Li, a lecturer on Chinese politics at the University of Vienna.
 The chaos abroad has "injected renewed energy to the CCP," she told AFP, as well as boosting its confidence and emboldening it to "act more proactively on all fronts."
 \- Human rights -
 That confidence has carried over into China's response to scrutiny of its human rights record.
 Beijing's power play in Hong Kong prompted an international backlash, with mostly Western governments saying the security law erodes the financial hub's unique freedoms.
 China's response to the world was terse: "It's none of your business," a top official said this week.
 China vowed to enact countermeasures after Britain offered a path to citizenship for millions of Hong Kongers and the US revoked the city's special trade status.
 It also used a newer tactic, countering the criticism by boasting the support of more than 50 countries at the UN Human Rights Council -- most with dubious democratic records themselves -- when 27 mostly Western nations slammed the move.
 Last year, when 22 nations criticised China's mass internment of Muslims in the Xinjiang region, Beijing responded with a list of 37 countries that supported its "anti-terrorism" strategy.
 Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of Beijing's office for Hong Kong affairs, summed up China's increasing confidence when responding to the Western criticism of the city's new security law.
 "Gone are the days when the Chinese depended on the whims of others to survive," Zhang said.

Rescuers Friday pulled several bodies from the scene of a landslide which killed over 160 jade miners in northern Myanmar, many of them migrant workers seeking their fortune in treacherous open-cast mines near the China border.
 The disaster -- the worst in memory to strike Myanmar's notoriously dangerous jade mines -- ocurred on Thursday when a hillside collapsed in heavy monsoon rains.
 A deluge of mud smothered workers scouring the land for the precious stone -- a moment of horror captured on cameraphone footage.
 A woman cried over the body of her son who lay in the grim line-up of bloodied corpses retrieved from the mud, his clothes ripped off by the force of the landslide.
 "The search and rescue missions continued today and we now have 166 bodies," the Myanmar Fire Services Department said in a Facebook post, raising the overnight toll by four.
 The area is close to the Chinese border in Kachin state, where billions of dollars of jade is believed to be scoured each year from bare hillsides by poor migrant workers seeking to strike it rich.
 As photos of the dead circulated on social media Facebook users began to identify workers hundreds of miles from home, leaving moving tributes to friends and family members.
 "Please bring my father back," said Hnin Wati. "A daughter's heart is breaking."
 Another, from a former miner, affectionately remembered one of the dead for his "kind-heart" and generosity with his food during tough shared times on the mountainside.
 Myanmar is one of the world's biggest sources of jadeite and the industry is supercharged by demand for the green gem from neighbouring China.
 Some jade brokers suspended online auctions on Thursday, and promised to donate money to their friends who were killed.
 Scores of miners die every year in landslides and other accidents on unstable, over-excavated mountainsides.
 They are often from impoverished ethnic minority communities, looking for scraps left behind by big firms.
 Low-quality stones can be exchanged for food or sold for $20 to waiting brokers.
 "Many of them (the dead) are Rakhine," Phon Graing, a Hpakant township official told AFP, referring to the ethnic group who live hundreds of kilometres away at the other end of the country, and who are among Myanmar's poorest communities.
 "But we don't have specific numbers yet."

Jurgen Klopp was adamant results remain important to him in Liverpool's closing games after the newly crowned Premier League champions were humbled 4-0 by Manchester City.
 The Reds came down to earth with a bump at the Etihad on Thursday in their first match since securing the title last week.
 Klopp's side still have a 20-point lead over Pep Guardiola's second-placed team but with six games remaining but the German boss still wants to finish strongly.
 "If someone said the result didn't matter for my team, I cannot help them," Klopp said.
 "Yes, results matter a lot. I am not only looking for results but we want to win football games -- that is the reason we work on the training ground, go to away games and play home games."
 One motivating factor could be the challenge of beating City's record of 100 points from two seasons ago.
 Liverpool, who have dropped points in just four games this season, currently have 86 ahead of Sunday's home clash with Aston Villa.
 "To get there we have to win football games and we didn't do that here," he said.
 "So now we make sure we are ready for Aston Villa and the points tally at the end of the season is the result of the results we collect until then."
 Liverpool started brightly against City, with Mohamed Salah testing Ederson and then hitting the post, but the hosts took charge after Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring from the penalty spot on 25 minutes.
 Further goals came from Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden before Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain put a Sterling shot into his own net.
 Despite the big points gap, City remain a potent force and could end the season with Champions League glory.
 "It's a reminder how good Man City are," Klopp said. "I didn't need that, I knew it before. The surprise that it's still possible, nice, that in a league where City are playing, someone else can be champions. That's not very likely with the quality they have.
 "We will see next season but it's a while until then. Next season we will think about next season."

“We are not going to rewrite history, but we have to explain history in its entirety because history was usually told by the winners and has avoided telling about the bloodshed, the exploitation and the slavery also associated with that age.”
 The city hall headed by Colau, a housing activist-turned-politician, in 2018 removed a statue of Barcelona aristocrat Antonio López who had made fortunes from slave trading.
 But in Colau’s view, the monument commemorating the encounter between Columbus and Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella on his return from his first voyage in 1493, should undergo a redo, not a removal.
 Colau said that she would back removing some figures on the nearly 200-foot- tall pedestal that lifts Columbus above Barcelona’s old port because they could be considered offensive for their depiction of native peoples. She also would like to put up explanatory plaques that would balance Columbus’ achievements and the negative impacts of the period of European colonialism his explorations inaugurated.
 “That was an age when there were positive things, but there was also exploitation of people who were living happily, and there were authentic massacres of indigenous peoples, and if you believe in human rights and democracy that is not defensible,” Colau said.
 In the U.S., statues of Columbus have been toppled by crowds or removed by authorities in the wake of protests for the death of George Floyd, as the demands for social and racial justice spread beyond the plight of African Americans to the legacy of European colonialism. Tensions reached dangerous levels in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where a man was shot when armed men fired at protesters who were trying to tear down a bronze statue of a Spanish conquistador.

Engraved bricks can purchased for $25 via a website Papritz set up. The profits this year will go to help cover costs of the plaza, but in the future will go to the school Civics Club to fundraise for the D.C. trip.
 Making this project possible involved multiple presentations, emails and levels of planning, something Papritz said has taken a lot of “energy and effort.”
 He had to present the idea to the Eagle Scout Review Board for approval, as well as gain approval from the school, which has been a big supporter.
 Superintendent Roxana Rico said she was proud of his contribution and efforts to make the school a better place.
 “He accepts challenges and sets goals for himself, our school and community,” she said. “He is intrinsically motivated and I appreciate his ‘can do’ attitude and his willingness to think outside the box," she said.
 So far, Papritz has about 130 engraved bricks for the plaza and plans to fill in the rest of space with plain bricks donated from local Home Depots, which have agreed to donate $150 worth of brick at each location he approaches.
 Between now and the beginning of the school year, the school will host a celebration to unveil the plaza.
 “I have this fun idea to put a tarp over it and have a little ribbon cutting with scissors revealing the plaza under the tarp, just as a fun thing to do,” Papritz said. “We’ll tell all the people who ordered bricks to come up to see what their brick looks like."
 His dad, Carew Papritz, has watched and helped guide his son through the process. He said they hope to see a number of alumni come forward to buy bricks and be a part of the celebration.
 “Wouldn't that be something to see dates on the bricks from the 1930s all the way up,” he said.
 Carew Papritz said the most difficult part for him has been “keeping his fingers out of it” and just guiding Cutter. It was a moment of pride to see his son’s reaction after the first orders came into the newly created website.
 “The orders started coming and he was like, ‘Wow, this is really cool, this is really exciting,’ people were buying into the idea,” he said. “It was one of those light bulb moments and the journey has been learning all these things, a lot of writing and talking to different professionals; it's really what an Eagle Scout project is all about.”
 Moving forward, the idea is for the school to take this over as a regular fundraising opportunity and keep adding to the plaza’s engraved bricks.
 Cutter Papritiz wants to see it years later and said this is the culmination of a lot of hard work.
 “I’m really hoping the school takes my advice and keeps it as a yearly fundraiser,” he said. “I’m just hoping for it to be there for maybe another 30 years so I can come back and say that was because of me and I'll feel really proud.”

 Ogden took a 7-0 lead through the first four innings with almost everyone involved, as only one batter failed to log a hit. Meanwhile with Denali Loecker -- who hit a home run as well -- pitching for the Bulldogs, the Hawks were less inclined to get on base.
   
 It wasn't until the fifth inning that Woodward broke the shutout when Chloe Houge sent Audrey Simmons through on a sacrifice hit. Simmons and Emma Anderson logged the only two hits of the night. Rian Jamison also got on base with a walk. With that limited number of base attempts, Monday marked a rare occasion the Hawks didn't have single steal attempt.
   
 From the pitching circle, Jamison made her 11th start of the season and struck out five in the process with nine hits and two walks.
   
 Madrid (1-10)
   
 Woodward took a little cue from the baseball team Tuesday afternoon. Heading into the sixth inning with a tied 3-3 road game, the Hawks turned things around for a 5-3 win to avoid collapse.
   
 Unlike the previous night, W-G came out with a 3-0 lead after the top of the fifth inning. The Tigers tied the score up once they stepped up to the plate, only for the Hawks to return in kind with another two-run inning to save the day.
   
 With the Hawks logging five hits and seven walks, Woodward styled its way to six stolen bases to help advance the score.
   
 Logging runs for the Hawks were Katelyn Bandstra, Chloe Houge, Libby Grell, Bella McDivitt and Audrey Simmons, who also batted in two more runs.
   
 By comparison, Madrid had even more success getting the ball in play as the Tigers posted 10 hits and three walks but were unable to advance on the base paths without a steal compared to W-G's aggressive approach. Rian Jamison also struck out five Tigers in the process.

St. Catherine’s lace is one of the many buckwheat species that provide food to a wide variety of pollinators; it is also a beautiful landscape plant, especially for larger spaces. Itsspecies name, giganteum, reveals its claim to fame; this is the largest of all the wild buckwheats, with the ability to grow up to 10 feet high and wide. It prefers fast-draining rocky soil but will tolerate heavier clay soils if seldom watered and can also handle alkaline conditions. Although this species is native to California’s Channel Islands, it easily adapts to summer temperatures in the north valley, and will withstand winter lows of 15 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit.

PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named Jean Castex, who coordinated France’s virus reopening strategy, as the country’s new prime minister.The relatively low-profile Castex replaces Edouard Philippe, who resigned earlier in the day. Macron is reshuffling the government to focus on restarting the economy after months of lockdown.Castex, 55, is a career public servant who has worked with multiple governments. France’s gradual reopening plan has been seen as generally successful so far.Many government members are expected to be replaced in the reshuffle.In an interview given to several local newspapers on Thursday, Macron, said he is seeking a “new path” to rebuild the country for the two remaining years of his term.He praised Philippe’s “outstanding work” in the past three years.“I will need to make choices to lead (the country) down the path,” he said.The reshuffle comes days after a green wave swept over France in local elections. Macron saw his young centrist party defeated in France’s biggest cities and failing to plant local roots across the country.It was planned even before Sunday’s voting, as Macron’s government faced obstacles and criticism before and during the virus crisis.As the pandemic was peaking in the country in March and April, authorities came under fire for the lack of masks, tests and medical equipment.Before that, Macron’s pro-business policies, widely seen as favoring the wealthier, had been hampered by the yellow vest economic movement against perceived social injustice. This winter, weeks of strikes and street demonstrations against a planned pension overhaul disrupted the country.In addition, Macron’s efforts to boost job creation have been swept away by the economic and social consequences of the country’s lockdown.The government issued a 460 billion-euro emergency package through a state-funded partial activity scheme, tax cuts and other financial aids for businesses, and Macron needs to adapt his policies as France’s economy is expected to shrink by 11% this year.The unemployment rate that fell from 9.2% at the beginning of Macron’s term in 2017 to 7.6% earlier this year — its lowest level since 2008 — is now expected to increase steadily.“Our first priority will be to rebuild an economy that is strong, ecological, sovereign and united,” Macron said in a televised address to the nation on June 14.He ruled out any tax rise and instead said “working and producing more” is the response amid bankruptcies and layoffs caused by the crisis.He put an emphasis on creating new jobs with climate-oriented policies including renovation of old buildings and greener transport and industries.Philippe, 49, is expected to become the mayor of his hometown of Le Havre, in western France, after he won a large victory in Sunday's voting.A conservative, former member of The Republicans’ party, he had joined Macron’s government in May 2017.He had seen his popularity sharply increase in recent weeks, according to French poll institutes that show many French consider he did good job in gradually easing virus-related restrictions in the country and enforcing an emergency package to support the French economy.Copyright 2020 Assoviated Press.

MONROVIA, Calif. - Most mornings, like clockwork, you could find Art Ballard pumping iron.      At least five days a week, he drove to Foothill Gym, where he beat on the punching bag, rode a stationary bike and worked his abs. After he joined the gym five years ago, he dropped 20 pounds, improved his balance and made friends.      At 91, he's still spry and doesn't take any medication other than an occasional Tylenol for aches and pains.      "Doctors love me," he said.      But when California enacted a statewide stay-at-home order in mid-March, his near-daily physical exercise and social interactions abruptly ended.   Ballard's health started to deteriorate: His back hurt, his legs cramped and he started becoming short of breath. As happens too often with older people, he also started to feel isolated and depressed.      "I was deeply concerned for myself because I didn't have an exercise routine at home," he said.      The University of Southern California's Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research conducted an analysis in late March, as the coronavirus established a foothold in the U.S., that found that older adults over 60 who lived alone were more likely to report feeling anxious or depressed than those living with companions.      The combination of the pandemic and nationwide lockdown orders put this already vulnerable population at greater risk, said Julie Zissimopoulos, co- director of the aging and cognition program at USC's Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics. Social distancing measures have weakened the support systems that older people who live alone depend on for basic activities, such as help with grocery shopping and transportation to doctor appointments.      "There's a huge, disproportionate impact on older adults with this virus and the health outcomes," said Lisa Marsh Ryerson, president of AARP Foundation. "During this shutdown, we've had growing public health and community acknowledgement of how serious it can be to sever the ties with our network."      Ballard, a retired jeweler, lives alone in a one-bedroom condo in Monrovia, a city of about 36,000 people about 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. He lost his wife of more than 50 years, Dorothy, to Alzheimer's disease in 2015. Since then, he has embraced his solitude and reveled in his newfound bachelorhood. He enjoys cooking and trying out recipes, listening to 1950s music and watching YouTube videos about World War II.      He has a girlfriend he met online - a retired greyhound trainer who lives in Arkansas. They haven't yet met in person.      Ballard felt he could handle the isolation of the lockdown order. He didn't have visitors during quarantine, but his son, Dan Ballard, checked on him by phone weekly.      In the beginning, Ballard tried to keep busy. He did his shopping early in the morning and took strolls around his neighborhood. But after a couple of months of not visiting the gym, Ballard began feeling sad and frustrated, and his health started to slide. He relied more on his walker and sometimes struggled to breathe.      "My girlfriend was concerned with how I was thinking," said Ballard, who speaks to her on the phone several times a day.      For Ballard, a self-proclaimed gym addict, Foothill Gym was a second home. Just as in the 1980s sitcom "Cheers," it's a place where everybody knows his name. Not going to the "club," as he calls it, was taking a toll on his mental and physical health, so he decided to visit Brian Whelan, the owner of the small, family-run gym, in late May.      "He comes in, out of breath, with a walker," Whelan recalled. "He couldn't hold his head up straight and it took him five minutes to catch his breath."      Whelan felt sad and angry. "Everyone here was almost in tears because this vibrant man was gone," he said. So Whelan broke the rules. He invited Ballard to visit the gym even before it officially reopened to the public.      "The gym business is more than physical health," said Whelan. "It's mental health."      Ballard resumed his beloved routine the last week of May, with the gym mostly to himself.      "Every day for the past two months, I've been sad," Ballard said on the first day back. "Today, I woke up and I was happy."      Day after day, Ballard improved. "Now he comes in without a walker, head up straight, and the spark in his eyes is getting brighter," Whelan said.      The gym reopened June 15. Despite the threat of COVID-19, Ballard is back to working out six days a week. Masks are required to enter the gym but can be removed when exercising.      Ballard isn't worried. "I'm 100% comfortable," he said. "I'll wear a mask if they ask me to."      Son Dan said he's worried about his dad being around people, but realizes the benefits.      "It's a scary balance. If he stops going to the gym and can't see anybody, I know he's going to deteriorate," he said. "At the end of the day, it's a quality-of-life decision that's his to make."   Ballard believes not being able to socialize was a bigger threat to his health than the risk of contracting the coronavirus.      "I found out how important my routine and exercise is," said Ballard. "It's given me back my life. And it's only going to get better."

PANAMA CITY -- Ricky Steele's father was one of the first African-American police officers in Bay County. He said that gives him a unique perspective as one of the artists involved in the Black Lives Matter exhibition opening Friday at the Panama City Center for the Arts.
   
 "I'm conflicted in trying to figure out a solution," Steele said. "One bad officer's action can make everybody look at all the cops like that."
   
 The exhibition, Black Lives Matter, opens at 10 a.m. Friday, July 3, at the Center for the Arts, 19 E. Fourth St. Its goal is to amplify Black voices and experiences that can get overwhelmed by other narratives. Local artists will share personal stories through their art and an accompanying statement.
   
 "For me, I hope the exhibit will bring people in to talk about what's going on in our society," Steele said. "Our community is a good community. Of course, there could be some improvement. But the exhibit is definitely a platform, and I hope it can create a dialogue."
   
 Steele added that he's part of a multiracial family, and because of that he only sees family -- not race. "I don't have racism or prejudice in my heart," he said.
   
 Artist Christon Anderson said the exhibit is deeply meaningful, especially to him as an artist of color.
   
 "I'm honored to be a part of it," Anderson said. "It shows we're part of the conversation, and we want to be seen as much as the rest of the world wants to be seen. To be looked at properly, as opposed to negatively."
   
 Anderson added that Panama City isn't a big city like other places where rallies and protests have taken place this spring, and the fact that the Center for the Arts and Bay Arts Alliance was willing to hold this exhibit "is a big deal."
   
 "Art shouldn't be silent -- especially in times like these," said Jayson Kretzer, executive director for Bay Arts Alliance, which oversees the Center for the Arts. "But we didn't want to make a statement without actions to back it up. We met with a group of local Black artists to hear their ideas. This exhibition grew from that conversation as the first step of a longer-term collaboration."
   
 Artist Willie Morris said the exhibit was just a first step in what must be a continuing walk. He said some Black people in the community don't feel they belong in downtown Panama City, and having this show at the heart of Downtown is a good way to start.
   
 "As a man, a husband, a father, a community leader, I wanted to do my part to bring forth awareness," Morris said. "The Black life does matter. What we do every day matters to the betterment of humanity. It's time to get to the root of how we, as a community, can do our part."
   
 Morris, raised in East St. Louis, Illinois, and Kalamazoo, Michigan, said each of the artists participating in the exhibit come from different backgrounds or distant parts of the country, but they face the same injustices and tell the same stories.
   
 "With all the things going on, the racial tension in the country, we felt a need to respond as artists in a creative way and express a need to be part of the social change," Morris said. "Our actions matter, and it's important that we stand together in solidarity."
   
 The exhibit also features a community wall for all visitors to share their own feelings, thoughts, and experiences. The show will continue through Aug. 1.
   
 Because of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, no formal opening reception is planned. All visitors are asked to wear masks inside the building to protect the staff and other visitors. Total building capacity will be 50 visitors, and groups will be restricted to 10 people. For details, see PCCenterForTheArts.com.

 The video was produced with a resolution of 21 meters per pixel and shows the full extent of the 82km wide (50 mile) Korolev crater in the northern lowlands of Mars. The crater is filled with ice all year round as its floor is two kilometers (1.2 miles) below its rim, making it a natural cold trap which shields the ice from the elements.
 The Mars Express orbiter mission launched on June 2, 2003, reaching the Red Planet six months later and beaming back incredible images of the planet ever since. It is the second-longest-surviving, continually active spacecraft in orbit around an alien world, second only to NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey.

 "I wondered if it was worth risking my health. But at the end of the day, weighing the options, I'd better be going."
 If Allen, whose name will appear in low-season commercial rumors for a third star, would be excluded, the Nets would be decimated.
 Still, despite starting 58 of Brooklyn's 64 games, Allen was seventh in minutes, while Jordan was eighth. And Allen had lost control in the center, out of the lineup in the past two games and sat in the fourth quarters since early February.
 Former coach Kenny Atkinson's decision to initiate Allen over Jordan was believed to be a matter of contention. But for the past 15 games, Jordan was second on the team in the fourth quarter (110), while Allen was last among the rotation players (39).
 Once the Nets parted ways with Atkinson, interim coach Jacque Vaughn's first move was to get Allen out of the lineup. Now his team is without Jordan, Kevin Durant, Nic Claxton and Wilson Chandler, leaving Allen as the only true great man, backed by 6-foot-9-inch, 228-pound Rodions Kurucs.
 "There is some pressure. I don't mean to say I'm the last one standing, bad as it sounds. There is some pressure so I can stay healthy and help the team succeed, "said Allen.
 "I've been in this position before.… Year of rookie. I was the great lead player, then last year when Ed (Davis) got hurt, I had the burden, and this year it happened. I just need to go out there and show that I'm capable of playing. at this level again. "

MDC-T interim president Thokozani Khupe has been accused of using her new position to hound an ex-lover, Gideon Shoko through recalling him from the Senate, New Zimbabwe reported.
 Shoko is a Bulawayo based politician and trade unionist.
 His expulsion has infuriated the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), which views the act as an affront by the labour-based MDC-T on labour movement activists.
 Shoko was Bulawayo Metropolitan senator and was expelled from Parliament Wednesday with other seven legislators, bringing the total number of recalled MDC Alliance MPs to 21.
 According to well-placed sources, Shoko and Khupe had a romantic relationship some years ago which led to the birth of a girl.
 Khupe, a former senior official in the ZCTU with late MDC founding leader Morgan Tsvangirai, left the labour group with other leaders 1999 to form MDC.
 It was during the time Shoko is said to have sired a daughter with the now opposition leader.
 Zimbabwe Banks and Allied Workers Union (ZIBAWU), Ian Makoshori said the labour movement was unhappy with the expulsion of Shoko from Senate.
 "We are very disgruntled as activists in the labour movement because these two met and dated during their time in unionism, but today Khupe is using her influence to harass a father to her own child," he said.
 "Where does she think Shoko will get money for the upkeep of their child if she behaves like this?".
 Peter Mutasa, the ZCTU president said Shoko's expulsion was a vicious attack on labour activists and accused Khupe of dumping her kith and kin.
 "It is an unexpected vicious attack by a group that hypocritically projects itself as labour activists. We never expected that they will go to such low levels and recall our immediate past deputy general secretary. That shows serious lack of respect and unmitigated hate of the labour movement," he said.
 Mutasa said the intentions behind the expulsions remained mysterious.
 However, contacted for comment, MDC-T deputy spokesperson Khaliphani Phugeni dismissed the allegations.
 "These recalls have nothing to do with Khupe as they are decided at party level. So far many MPs and senators have been recalled regardless of past relationships," he said.

French appeals judges on Friday threw out a bid to reopen an investigation into the 1994 assassination of Rwanda's president which sparked a 100-day genocide that killed 800,000 people.
 While families of those who died when Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was shot down vowed to pursue their quest for justice, Rwanda dismissed the French process as a "complete farce".
 The decades-long legal battle has poisoned relations between the two countries.
 Habyarimana's widow Agathe and relatives of the French crew of the downed plane said they will seek to challenge Friday's decision before France's highest court.
 The appeals court in Paris had been asked to revisit a 2018 decision to throw out a probe against nine members and former members of incumbent Rwandan President Paul Kagame's entourage.
 After six months of deliberations, it handed down a 64-page judgment Friday confirming that decision.
 A plane carrying Habyarimana, from Rwanda's Hutu majority, was shot down in Kigali on April 6, 1994, shattering a fragile peace process and triggering a killing spree targeting mainly members of the Tutsi ethnic minority, but also moderate Hutus.
 The plane was struck by at least one missile as it came in to land at Kigali, also killing Burundi's president Cyprien Ntaryamira, another Hutu, on board.
 A probe was opened in France in 1998 at the request of families of the French crew.
 \- Who did it? -
 The investigation initially focused on allies of Kagame, a Tutsi who led the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebel movement that came to power in 1994 after defeating the genocidal Hutu regime.
 Kagame, who became Rwanda's president in 2000, broke diplomatic ties with Paris between 2006 and 2009 after France issued arrest warrants for his allies.
 Then in 2012, a report by French experts pinpointed the camp of Kanombe, controlled by Habyarimana's army, as the missile launch site -- shifting the focus of the investigation.
 Kigali said that finding vindicated its belief that the attack was carried out by Hutu extremists who believed Habyarimana was too moderate and who opposed the Arusha peace process then under way.
 As investigations dragged on in France, Kagame accused Paris ahead of the genocide's 20th anniversary in 2014, of having played a "direct role" in the killing.
 And in November 2016, Kigali launched an inquiry into the alleged role of 20 French officials in the genocide that began hours after the plane was brought down.
 France has always denied the allegations and last year President Emmanuel Macron announced the creation of a panel of historians and researchers to look into the claims.
 \- 'Travesty of justice' -
 In December 2018, French investigating magistrates closed the probe for lack of evidence.
 The victims' families want the investigation to be reopened so that French investigators can gain access to a secret 2003 report of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said to blame Kagame's side for the attack.
 "It is a decision which, unfortunately, does not surprise us," Agathe Habyarimana's lawyer Philippe Meilhac told reporters Friday, denouncing "omnipresent political" pressure on the case.
 For his part, defence attorney Leon-Lef Forster regretted the families' announcement of a further appeal which he described as a "delaying tactic".
 In Kigali, Justice Minister Johnston Busingye tweeted the case was "a travesty of justice, a total and complete farce that should not have happened in the first place."
 In an interview this week, Kagame also expressed a wish for the matter to end.
 "I believe that the past is behind us," the president told the Jeune Afrique weekly news magazine.
 "Reopening a classified file is to invite problems," he said. "If things are not definitively clarified, our relations are likely to suffer one way or another."

Lewis Hamilton unveiled a new 'Black Lives Matter' helmet design on Friday as Formula One roared back to life in the Styrian Alps in opening practice at the belated and surreal season-opening Austrian Grand Prix.
 The six-time champion, who has been an outspoken supporter of the campaign for equality and diversity since the death of American George Floyd last month, revealed the statement helmet before climbing into his Mercedes in anger for the first time this year.
 His new helmet is predominantly black and the branding includes a logo for 'Black Lives Matter', the anti-racism campaign that sparked worldwide demonstrations following Floyd's death, under the knee of a police officer, in Minneapolis.
 Hamilton's Mercedes W11 car was also running in revised new black livery, instead of the team's traditional silver, with a message to 'End Racism' on the halo.
 "For a long time, we've been planning for the livery change for the car, for the (driver) suit change and I have also designed my helmet in black," said Hamilton, speaking on a video released on social media.
 "Normally, my helmet is white, my suit is white and obviously the car is in silver…. This is why – it's the whole reason that the helmet has changed its colour and the suit and the car.
 "It's supporting equality, above all, and just really continuing to solidify that important message as we currently have 'the mic' and people are starting to listen. So, it's an opportunity to push that message and really hold people accountable.
 "It's not good enough, even if someone says to you 'we've been doing something' or 'we've been trying'. They need to try harder because it is still a big issue that the world is fighting 60 years later, after Martin Luther King was fighting for it and gave his life."
 Hamilton was slow to join the early fray in earnest on Friday in first free practice, not clocking a 'timed' lap until 30 minutes into the 90-minute session, but he swiftly went top of the times half a second clear of Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas.
 McLaren's Lando Norris was a second adrift in third ahead of Ferrari-bounf team-mate Carlos Sainz on the damp track at the Red Bull Ring, following overnight rain.
 The action signalled the return of Formula One for the first time in seven months – albeit behind closed doors and under strictly regulated conditions -- after the original season-opener in Australia was cancelled in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 The VPSB is planning for students to return to their campus for the 2020-21 school year. With the unknowns involved in the Covid-19 Pandemic, we are developing several contingency plans. The LDOE released guidelines for the reopening of school yesterday and we will closely follow these guidelines. We are aware that our faculty, staff, students, and parents are waiting for the details for 20-21 school year. Once these state recommendations are fully completed and we know the path forward, more information will be forthcoming. A face to face educational setting is what we know is best for our students; however, school days may need to look differently as we have to implement safety guidelines and protocols.
 We are developing plans to bring our students back to their campuses, this fall. While our number one goal is to have our students back in our classrooms, we are have formulating plans to also include a hybrid model of schooling that will allow half the students to attend in person, while the other half participate through virtual learning (Google Classroom). These groups would attend every other day or every other week. For the families who are not comfortable with their students returning to our campuses in person, virtual education options will be available so no student will fall behind or miss any opportunity.
 We will be releasing details that are more specific in the near future. We want our stakeholders to know that we are hoping to see our students in August, but we will take every necessary precautionary action to keep our children and employees safe. Please keep in contact with your school for guidelines. We also encourage you to follow your school website and the VPSB website for additional details for the 20-21 school year. As part of our planning process, we ask that you complete the parent survey that we have provided for you on the VPSB website.
 Thank You,
 James Williams
 Superintendent
