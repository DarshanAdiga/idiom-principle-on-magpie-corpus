n contextul actual, exerciţiul de a reflecta la ceea ce se întâmplă în jurul nostru a devenit tot mai important. Perspectiva şi munca de ani de zile, pe care o depun regizorii de documentar pentru a aduce pe ecran felii din realităţile care ne înconjoară, este de nepreţuit. Aceste realităţi merită cunoscute şi retrăite prin intermediul filmului documentar şi astfel vom înţelege mult mai articulat lumea în care trăim”, a declarat regizorul Dumitru Budrala, directorul fondator al Astra Film Festival.

 Documentarul manifest al omului de afaceri Ştefan-Valentin Mandachi (#şîeu), „30 de ani şi 15 minute”, care va fi proiectat la Sibiu în prezenţa autorului, expune problema lipsei infrastructurii de transport şi, implicit, a iresponsabilităţii autorităţilor din ultimii 30 de ani. Atitudini care au plasat România pe ultimul loc în Europa în materie de kilometri de autostradă şi pe locul întâi la numărul de morţi în accidente rutiere.
 Filmul Monicăi Lăzurean-Gorgan „Lemn” (2020) este un thriller ecologic, care urmăreşte fenomenul defrişărilor ilegale din ţara noastră, dezvăluind o caracatiţă mondială de miliarde de euro.
 Poveştile nedigerate ale trecutului comunist („Nostalgia dictaturii”, 2020 - Marius Th. Barna), Revoluţia din 1989 - cu focus pe evenimentele de la Sibiu („Omul cu roţile”, 2019 - Cornel Mihalache) sau explozia nucleară de la Cernobîl („Totul nu va fi bine”, 2020 - Adrian Pîrvu & Helena Maksyom) sunt trei teme care cu siguranţă vor produce emoţie publicului prin felul în care sunt puse în scenă.
 La rândul său, filmul „23 august 1944”, de Andra Tarara (2020) dezvăluie experienţa personală a patru cetăţeni români de etnie evreiască, aducând o perspectivă nouă asupra acestui eveniment istoric major. Iar „Bugan - Nu am respirat aerul degeaba” (2019), al olandezului Duco Tellegen, expune portretul incredibil al unui dizident politic român din perioada comunistă.
 Filmul lui Ellen Fiske & Joanna Karlberg, „Josefin & Florin” (2019), o poveste de dragoste inedită între Florin, un tânăr rom venit la cerşit şi Iosefin, o suedeză, va fi prezentat în premieră absolută în România.
 Teme precum restabilirea legăturilor cu părinţii şi chestionarea acestora în legătură cu decizia de a-şi abandona responsabilităţile de părinte se articulează puternic şi emoţionant în filmele lui Andrei Dăscălescu („Holy Father”, 2020) şi Diana Nicolae & Nori Florentina Vito („Come and find me”, 2019).
 „Casa cu păpuşi”, 2020, debutul regizoral al directorului de imagine Tudor Platon, este o incursiune într-un univers special - vacanţa anuală a unor femei de 70 de ani, care întreţin iluzia că, pentru ele, timpul nu a trecut şi au rămas aceleaşi fete tinere, frumoase şi îndrăgostite ca în urmă cu 50 de ani. „Moartea... punct sau virgulă?” (2020), de Liviu Vasile Popovici, expune mărturiile impresionate ale unor persoane care s-au întors din moarte clinică.
 Spiritul „Deltei” Văcăreşti, un loc aparte aflat la marginea Bucureştiului, este evocat în două filme („Acasă, my home”, 2020 - de Radu Ciorniciuc, respectiv „The Delta of Bucharest”, de Eva Pervolovici 2020). Sunt filme care redau poveşti inspirate din vieţile reale ale unor oameni care trăiesc sau au trăit în acest loc unic.

 Filmul „Between realms” de Maria Cinar-Jiga descrie portretul emoţionant al unei tinere de etnie ucraineană, care îşi împarte timpul între scoala şi păstoritul tradiţional practicat în satul natal, în sânul familiei. Filmul Alinei Manolache, „Copii pierduţi pe plajă” (2020) arată imaginea subiectivă a unei generaţii care s-a născut şi a crescut în „anii liberi” de după 1990 iar acum a ajuns la maturitate.

Two fatal hit-and-run cases in Onslow County are at risk of not being solved as Highway Patrol have exhausted all of their leads.
   
 Sergeant John Edwards explained both cases lacked physical evidence at each crime scene and so far they have been unsuccessful at finding the individuals involved.
   
 Now investigators are in need of anyone with information about the two case to come forward in hopes of being able to bring justice for the families impacted by the deaths.
   
 One of the cases, 19-year-old Jordan Briauna Rowles, was found dead on U.S. 17 near High Hill Road shortly after midnight on November 9, 2019. When troopers arrived they discovered Rowles had been hit by three different cars, all of whom gave statements to investigators.
   
 After speaking with the three drivers and reviewing the report from the medical examiner, investigators realized a fourth car was involved that hit and killed Rowles.
   
 Rowles was last seen earlier that night with a friend, though the individual was not able to provide investigators with much information. Due to how isolated the area is at that time of night, Edwards added its unlikely anyone saw who is responsible.
   
 "At that time of night it is possible that someone hit Ms. Rowles and just kept on going, not even stopping to be bothered with the fact that they just hit someone," said Edwards. He also explained the car that killed Rowles would have received severe front end damage.
   
 Another hit and run
   
 Almost a month and a half later, law enforcement saw a second hit-and-run on Dc. 26 when Jim Powell, 45, was found unconscious on Murrill Hill Road in Jacksonville.
   
 Powell was visiting friends when he left and began walking down the road to the Scotchman's Gas Station around 3 p.m. He was found by a passerby the next day and taken to Vidant Medical Center in Greenville, where he later died on Jan 10.
   
 Through the investigation, parts of a passenger side window that belonged to a Ford F-150 truck between 2009 and 2013 were found at the scene. Along with the medical examiners report that showed Powell's only injury was a blunt force strike to the back of the head, it was determined he was the victim of a hit- and-run.
   
 Troopers have reviewed video surveillance footage from the gas station and Family Dollar on Highway 53, however the videos did not have a street view of the road.
   
 "We can't bring back Mr. Powell and Ms. Rowles but we can definitely help with some closure for the families," added Edwards. "Anyone with information is asked to reach out to us immediately."
   
 Anyone with tips can call the Highway Patrol at 910-347-1751 or *47 if they call outside of the hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and ask for Sergeant John Edwards.
   
 Crime Stoppers offers cash rewards of up to $2,500 for information provided that's deemed of value or assistance to law enforcement. Callers to Crime Stoppers are not required to reveal their identities. Information can also be anonymously texted via Text-A-Tip by typing TIP4CSJAX and the message to 274637.

Non voglio giudicare le ricerche, ma il posto dove e stato trovato il bambino dicevano che era stato bonificato. Anche io, come l'ex carabiniere, avevo portato come me una piccola falce e un coltello, perche la boscaglia era molto fitta. Ho riunito un gruppetto e ci siamo organizzati per le ricerche. Poi - ha concluso - ho chiesto di recitare una preghiera sperando che Viviana indirizzasse noi e gli altri volontari per poter trovare Gioele".

TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - University of Arizona students are gearing up for the first day of the fall semester on Monday, Aug. 24.But with social distancing a big part of stopping the spread of COVID-19, experts said loneliness could be a factor this semester.As of right now, restrictions are in place across campus, from in-class to the dining halls, even recreation facilities. Student-life activities are also up in the air.All of these are important ways students typically build connections on campus.To help curb the loneliness, relationship experts advise doing what you’d normally do in person to make friends, but virtually.For example, join a club.The U of A, Arizona State University, even Pima Community College have dozens of clubs and organizations students can join and meet new people.&nbsp;Reach out and see if they’re holding meetings online this fall.If you're a freshman, talk to your orientation leader or adviser to see what the school is doing this semester to create a sense of community.&nbsp;It could be different virtual events or a virtual welcome party. Just get involved.Don't be afraid to reach out to your classmates.&nbsp;You can see all of their names on Zoom, so message them and see if they want to go for a socially distant walk outside or have a group Facetime chat with other friends.Experts said it's important to be intentional during this time."Community is so important for college students. Finding your friends helps keep you motivated and engaged. So being able to still connect with people, even though many colleges are hybrid and students are online, is really important,"&nbsp;relationship researcher,&nbsp;Dr. Marisa Cohen said.Cohen added, while technology is wonderful, it really can’t take the place of face-to-face interaction.Maybe host a small, open-air barbecue for friends, but only do what you’re comfortable with.Copyright 2020 KOLD News 13.

TRAI is currently probing Vodafone Idea's priority plan RedX and Bharti Airtel Platinum Offering to see if network preference to specific customers leads to deterioration of services for other non-premium subscribers or violates any norms.The regulator had earlier shot off questions to the two operators asking them to explain their position on the controversial issue and provide relevant data to substantiate their claims.In its presentation to TRAI on August 10, Airtel defended its platinum offering saying it was launched with bonafide understanding that regulator does not have concerns over such an offering as no objection had been raised on a similar plan by Vodafone Idea for 8-9 months.Airtel had argued that operators often bundle their tariff plans and provide plan linked benefits with regard to content, devices, discounts for voice and data.Responding to questions raised by telecom regulator TRAI over its priority plan earlier, Vodafone Idea had argued that a new tariff plan is not a new service. Vodafone Idea also countered TRAI's contention that the RedX plan that commits higher speeds should have been informed separately so different aspects could have been examined before such service was launched.Vodafone Idea had justified its pay-more-for-priority-experience plan offered to its subscribers, and said that telecom operators faced a double whammy of having to make continuous investments in an era of call and data charges falling way below cost due to cut-throat competition.
