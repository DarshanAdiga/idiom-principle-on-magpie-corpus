While the numbers were strong, Starkel wasn't as sharp as his first two full games. Along with the interception, Starkel nearly served up a pick-six to UNLV’s Aaron Lewis, who dropped the errant pass. Starkel also couldn’t connect with Tre Walker late in the game on what could’ve been another touchdown.

"Speed is always a factor in collisions that occur on the highway," Hunter said. "We always look at everything. We don't know things like alcohol or drug use.

Pete Prisco: "I think they're going to go up and down the field. I think (Drew) Lock is starting to play better, and I don't believe in the Raiders defense at all. We saw that with (Justin) Herbert last week, who should've won the game. … But I think both teams will score here. I don't think the Raiders are very good on defense, and I think the Broncos have some kind of issues. I'm gonna go Broncos plus the points, and I like the Over. These aren't my best bets, but I like the Over."

The oncologist said he had four to six weeks to live. We were devastated. As we sat around my dad's hospital bed, all of us crying and shell-shocked, my father, who we all adored, spoke up. In an incredibly strong voice, he said "Ya'll, I have no regrets.  I know where I will be in four to six weeks." He then quoted one of his favorite verses in God's Word, Psalms 20:7 "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will trust in the LORD our God." The chariots and horses that I was trusting in were the doctors and chemo, or even some miracle that might save my father.  In that moment, my dying father taught me an important lesson -- we can put our trust and our hope in many things like doctors, our job, finances, family, a vaccine, even a political party or a president. At the end of the day, they are all just chariots and horses -- they will disappoint us, confuse us, even fail us.

Tom would have grown up in a rapidly changing world that was making advances in social, political and economic circles. By the time he reached the age of 18 in 1895 the world had quite literally tranformed.
 The world map had been almost entirely revealed and drawn up for the first time ever following the Scramble for Africa, the Industrial Revolution had undergone a second wave which revolutionised factory production and the intermittent Liberal government of William Gladstone was improving the lives of working people while challenging pillars of British society including Irish home rule and the House of Lords.
 Tom's early life is hard to pin down due to a continued and sustained gap in records but we can gleam a few rather odd details from what we can see.
 In 1914, when the Great War started, Tom would have been 27, and is likely to have signed up to his nearest regiment, the Kings Own Royal Lancaster Regiment based at Bowerham Barracks in the city. War records are hard to decipher and there are five Private Thomas Burns in the Kings Own during World War I but given his age we can safely assume he was one of them.
 Tom later married a woman named Martha Nesbitt in June, 1932, when they were both in their 40s, a strange time to be wed during the early 20th century especially seeing as it appeared to be their first engagement. There is no suggestion or record that either person had been a widow or widower previously.
