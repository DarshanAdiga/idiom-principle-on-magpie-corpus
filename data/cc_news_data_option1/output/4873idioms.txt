At first, Lauer asked players for donations to help recoup the $700 a month it cost him to rent the server space. The game’s popularity grew, and costs went up, so in August he stopped asking for donations and began running ads via Google on the game’s website. The game remains free to play, although people can pay to remove ads or access expansions.
 Lauer declined to say how much revenue the site is drawing but said it’s enough to cover the cost of the now-increased server space.
 “My plan when I launched the site was to pay for it out of pocket as long as states were mandating quarantine because I knew a lot of people would be out of work or bored at home and would need some kind of emotional reprieve,” he said.
 He was right.

Maybe I shouldn’t say alternate facts, because these people live in a dream world.
 We also live in a time where politics has divided Americans nearly as much as it did prior to the Civil War.
 It took four years and 600,000-plus deaths for that to play out.
 If COVID-19 isn’t checked either by masks, social distancing and promised vaccines, that 600,000-plus dead may again come to fruition.
 As I have written in the past, history is replete with instances that mirror what we are experiencing today.
 Just 100 years ago the so-called Spanish flu pandemic was as deadly as the Black Plague was in Europe in the Middle Ages — at least in the number of people it killed and infected.
 Yellow fever, malaria, small pox, ebola, AIDs and tuberculosis are just the headliners of diseases that have befallen man over the millennia.
 For much of mankind’s history, there were no newspapers, TV stations or the internet to help disseminate information to the millions of us now connected to the world of information.
 Of course, all the information out there for us to digest about this disease has been shadowed by a seemingly endless supply of disinformation.
 Reading about the Black Plague that killed untold millions centuries ago, there was disinformation people received — by word of mouth.
 In an oblique similarity between COVID-19 and the Black Death, during the 14th century, Jewish communities appeared to be dying in fewer numbers than Christian neighbors. Many saw this as evidence Jews intentionally spread plague by poisoning wells, rivers and springs.
 As a result, Jewish people all over Europe were tortured and killed.
 That’s right.
 Scapegoating was a large element of the Black Death, just like it has occurred here during COVID-19.
 This time, it’s Asians.
 In fact, outsiders also were blamed. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and her dealings with plague, she said any outsider wishing to enter London could only do so if they possessed a special certificate — reserved only for the wealthy.
 Have we reached that point on Thanksgiving Day, 2020?
 It’s there to contemplate on the pages of history.

South Africa New coach Ernst Middendorp watched from the stand as Maritzburg United lost 2-1 at home to SuperSport United and remain pointless after five straight South African Premiership defeats.
 The 62-year-old German takes over the bottom club next week after quitting Ethiopian club Saint George just one month into a three-year contract.
 Middendorp succeeds Eric Tinkler, the former South Africa midfielder who was fired after a disastrous start to the season.
 Tunisia Debutants US Monastir scored in each half to defeat Fasil Kenema of Ethiopia 2-0 in the first leg of a Confederation Cup preliminary round tie.
 Ali al Omari netted after only three minutes for the north Africans in Monastir and Fahmi Ben Ramadan doubled the lead 12 minutes into the second half.
 Kenema, who are making a second successive appearance in the competition, impressed during the first half and were unlucky to trail at half-time.
 Guinea CI Kamsar of Guinea were held 0-0 at home by Renaissance of Chad in a Confederation Cup preliminary round first leg in Conakry.
 The Guineans had been expected to build an aggregate lead as they seek to emulate compatriots Horoya, who reached the semi-finals of the second-tier African club competition last season.
 Renaissance host the return match in N'Djamena next weekend hoping to achieve a rare Chadian victory in a CAF club competition.
 Morocco Asante Kotoko of Ghana winger Augustine Okrah have signed a three-year contract with Confederation Cup title-holders Renaissance Berkane of Morocco.
 The deal is reportedly worth 140,000 Euros ($165,000) and comes two months before his contract with the Ghanaian club expires and he would become a free agent.
 Berkane are based in the citrus fruit-producing northeast of Morocco and are popularly known as the 'Orange Boys'.

  “I love the Tigers. I love all of these girls,” she said. “I’ve been playing with them for so long and to just have it end was really sad. I’ll miss them all, but I’m very thankful for the time I had with them.”


  Cerveny signed her letter of intent to play at Nebraska-Omaha, which is a program being rebuilt with a Nebraska-heavy roster and a brand new facility.


  “I think she’ll start helping build that program,” Speak said. “She did it for us here at Hastings High. This group of seniors has been around here in the middle of it. I think she can do the same thing at Omaha. She has great leadership qualities and I think if she can get people to follow her work ethic and just her desire to win, I think they can do the right things.”

Johannesburg, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 28th Nov, 2020 ) :Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane has reacted to a 2-1 victory over arch rivals Zamalek in the CAF Champions League final by tweeting "I had to come to the Nile River to catch the big fish".
 He won the competition once in six attempts with previous club Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, but needed only two months to guide Ahly to a record-extending ninth title in the all-Egyptian clash.
 Mosimane joined Ahly in September after Swiss coach Rene Weiler could not agree terms for a renewal of a one-year contract.
 Here, AFP Sport rounds up football news from around Africa.
 Egypt Mosimane became only the third coach after Argentine Oscar Fullone and Egyptian Mahmoud el Gohary to steer two clubs to the CAF Champions League title.
 Both Mosimane successes came against Zamalek, with Sundowns in 2016 and with Ahly this weekend as Mohamed 'Afsha' Magdy scored a spectacular winner five minutes from time behind closed doors in Cairo.
 Fullone won back-to-back titles with ASEC Mimosas of the Ivory Coast and Raja Casablanca of Morocco in 1998 and 1999 and El Gohary masterminded the 1982 and 1993 victories of Ahly and Zamalek respectively.
 Ghana Former AshantiGold of Ghana captain and forward Shafiu Mumuni has joined US Monastir of Tunisia on a two-year contract.

 The 25-year-old began his professional career with Wassaman United in 2011 and moved to AshantiGold one year later.

 Atbara and KVZ are both making second appearances in the African equivalent of the UEFA Europa League having previously suffered preliminary round losses.

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) President and Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao has called for a vote in favour of peace and stability in Hyderabad for the ensuing elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).
 Addressing a public meeting at the Lal Bahadur Stadium here on Saturday, he asked people to be careful about the ‘divisive forces’ that were trying to disturb the peaceful atmosphere in the city.
 The polling for 150 wards in the city will be held on December 1. Counting will be on December 4.
 “For centuries, Hyderabad has been a cosmopolitan city. It will remain a cosmopolitan city. It should be an inclusive city,” he said.
 Making an appeal to the businesses, professionals and intellectuals, he said they should raise to the occasion and go for voting in large numbers to protect the city. “You should not fall for the divisive statements. In the last seven years, we are taking care of all people alike without discriminating them on their caste, region or religion,” he said.
 Referring to the line-up of top BJP national leadership campaigning in the local body elections, he said that the leaders from the other States didn’t have any stakes here and that the TRS would stand by the promises it made.
 Criticising the Centre for not extending any financial help for the flood- ravaged Hyderabad, he said the State Government would continue to disburse the compensation (₹10,000 each) after the elections.
 “We asked the Centre to give an assistance of ₹1,350 crore. But it didn’t give even 13 paise,” he said.
 He said the State so far has disbursed ₹650 crore as compensation to 6.5 lakh families. “There may be about 2-3 lakhs people more who are left out as the Model Code of Conduct comes into effect. We will spend ₹300-400 crore to pay them the compensation,” he said.
 Stating that he stood before them for a review of the performance of his government in the last six years, he said the State could solve the problems of power and water shortages soon after taking over the reins.
 “Disproving the doomsayers before the bifurcation of the State, Telangana performed well on several development parameters,” he said.
 “We have announced the supply of drinking water free of charge (for the usage of up to 20,000 litres). We will extend this offer to those living in apartment complexes too. We are working on a plan to provide drinking water round the clock,” he said.

It's a lot more practical than the CRG9 above, even if it is double the price (you can thank the G-Sync Ultimate tax for that). Alternatively, if you're less fussed about HDR, one of the monitors below should fit the bill.

The kind of mistake that Indira Gandhi had made by encouraging Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale is again being made by the Congress government in Punjab led by Amarinder Singh. The activities of Khalistan supporters are increasing during the Amarinder regime. It was even being discussed that some people could try to unfurl Khalistani flags in Delhi. People are already suffering due to the outbreak of the Corona pandemic. All business has been affected. The number of people dying from Corona in Delhi is increasing. Union Home Minister Amit Shah himself had to hold a meeting about the deteriorating condition of the pandemic outbreak in Delhi. Para-military forces had to be deployed in light of the shortage of doctors. In the guise of opposition to the agriculture bills, people who have come to the Capital with intention of camping in Delhi will only aggravate the agony of Coronavirus.

Black Friday can be a long, hard day for retail workers, and “I tell them just to have fun,” Evangelista said.
 Many shoppers were looking for deals on computers, printers and other electronics, and Evangelista encouraged those in need of home office equipment to “come and shop, we’re here to help.”
 In line outside was Michele Baker, who said she typically shops online after Thanksgiving, but decided to visit some brick-and-mortar stores this year because of the much smaller crowds.
 “With most people staying home, I can see what I’m buying, instead of ordering online,” Baker said.
 The next in the queue, Alex Nisbett, said she was shopping for a computer desk, and “I want to see how big it is,” and judge pieces in person rather than buying online based on measurements.
 At Island Linen, the store opened at 6 a.m. offering as much as 60 percent off merchandise.
 Shoppers, however, had two days including Thanksgiving Day to take advantage of deals on most merchandise from bed and bath and home decorations to appliances that included air fryers and juicers. An ironing board priced at $59 was discounted to just under $24, and braided straw rugs that once were priced at more than $100 were placed on clearance for $9.99. Owner Haytham Abdallah said his store’s offering of Black Friday deals two days early — and staying open throughout Thanksgiving Day — was merely a sign of the times.
 “Because of the coronavirus we decided to space it out so we don’t get a a big crowd Friday,” he said on Thanksgiving night.
 Sales between Wednesday and Thursday was “as usual since the pandemic.”
 “Even with corona, traffic, it was OK because we have items customers are looking for — Dettol, sanitizers, house cleaning stuff, Clorox wipes,” Abdallah said of sales.
 The store, which was opened from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday and closed an hour earlier on Thanksgiving night, will continue its late-hour operation through January. It normally closes at 6. Sales were “on and off like most other businesses,” Abdallah said Thursday night.
 “We expect to make good sales because customers have been waiting for Black Friday, and not many know we started the day before,” he said.
 In anticipation of doing more business on Friday, Abdallah said he was bringing on an additional four sales people to beef up the eight normally on staff. In Red Hook Plaza on the East End, Caribbean Surf Co. was doing brisk business with 75% off sandals, swimwear, clothing and accessories.

Upgrading to one of today's best gaming CPUs can make a surprising difference to your PC's overall gaming performance, particularly if you tend to play games at a resolution of 1920×1080\. The difference becomes a lot less marked at 1440p and 4K, though, so if you regularly play games at these resolutions, then you can save yourself a lot of money by opting for a mid-range CPU instead of an expensive high-end one.

After the war, while visiting family in Hobro, Denmark, she met Erik, a former member of the Resistance. In 1948, he would take a job with the Danish West India Company on St. Thomas. In 1949, she would travel 5,000 miles, and what seemed like 50 years back in time, to a tropical island and culture unlike anything she had ever known. She and Erik married and made their lifelong home on the island.
 For almost three decades, Erna worked as the manager and buyer for Continental, a store that sold china, crystal, silverware, and other fine European goods. She developed lifelong relationships with both islanders and some of the titans of American industry, both of whom would return to see her year after year. She was so trusted that in some instances off-island customers asked her to select and package Christmas gifts for their employees, package everything up for pick up following their cruise, and fill in the correct amount on the check they left with her.

"So I wanted to be a professional wrestler my whole life, and my whole family knew that," Jay stated. "And my aunt and uncle are good family friends with Glacier, Ray Lloyd, and I guess one day they were just talking about it, and he was like, 'Hey, me and QT Marshall' - who I didn't know who he was at the time - 'are opening a school in Atlanta. You should come check it out and see if it's something she wants to do,' and this was in 2017. So, I ended up going to a camp; it was a super camp at the Power Factory in December, and I just went for a day.
 "I had never even stepped foot in a ring before. I literally was so scared because everyone there knew what they were doing, and I did not. So, I went to the camp - I loved it. It scared me but in a good way, and I ended up coming back a few times, I think, in February and all the months leading up to that summer, and then I ended up making the choice that I wanted to move to Atlanta full-time to train. So I moved to Atlanta in 2018, in June, to train full- time."
 Jay also gave her reaction to being part of the Brodie Lee and Cody feud where after Lee defeated Cody for the title, Jay choked out Brandi on the stage. She revealed that Arn Anderson taught her how to perform the sleeper hold.
 "Oh my gosh, I just got chills when you start talking about. It's crazy to think about," Jay remarked. "I mean Cody and Brandi are two people I never thought I would work for, let alone work with, and to get that spot and me being so new, oh my gosh.
 "It was one of those things too where once I did it, I was like, 'Is this real?' I remember too, whenever they told me that's what I was going to do, Arn Anderson was there explaining to me how to do it and showing me the hold and everything, and that was another moment where I was like, 'Oh my gosh, Arn Anderson is showing me how to do a sleeper. What is my life right now?' So yeah, the whole thing was super cool. I'm very lucky to have that spot. It's something I'll always remember. Brandi is great, so it was awesome."
 Jay also talked about how much Jerry Lynn has helped her in her development. She noted that Lynn is very open and very helpful in his advice.
 "So I haven't had a lot of matches in general, and I have not had a lot of matches at AEW yet," Jay noted. "So every time that I would have a match, he would tell me little things that I can work on, and it just really meant a lot to me because I never went to him.
 "I didn't really know who to go to other than the person who was coaching my match, and so, he would always come up to me and say, 'Hey, you can do this next time.' And every time, I would listen, and it really meant a lot to me and it really helped because it's the little details that matter. So he would say, 'You need to look scarier with your eyes,' and I would be like, 'Okay, how do I do that?' And he would explain it to me, and it helped a lot. And I would do it the next time I went out."
 Jay also gave her reaction to be a women's wrestler in a time where women's wrestling is flourishing more so than in the past. She praised the AEW women's division as well as Dustin Rhodes and his work in helping out the women's division.
 "I would never have imagined that I would be even where I am right now," Jay said. "So it does mean a lot to me, and one thing that I definitely want to do too because I would not consider myself a high flyer or being able to do a lot of the crazy stuff that a lot of the girls can do, but I just want to tell stories, and I want to keep doing that. And I think all the women here are kicking butt, and we're working hard. We're training every week that we're there, so yeah, it means a lot to me. It's a really cool time to be a part of women's wrestling.
 "Dustin's great too. He's been another instrumental part of all the women and stuff, and he's always there to help and always there to give us advice, which also means a lot.

You’re a consummate perfectionist, terrified deep down that the finished project is never good enough. You have difficulty telling when something is incomplete or finished. You savor your work as an alcoholic would savor a shot of bourbon. You inadvertently prolong and create additional work when you’re almost finished with a task. You’re notorious for creating to-do lists that take longer to generate than completing the task. Your detailed, self-absorbed work style makes it hard to function on a team. Your nitpicking and inability to let projects go are maddening to coworkers who complain that you drag your feet, dot every 'i' and cross every 't.' When colleagues are ready to move on, you hold them back by over-analyzing, taking ideas apart, thinking them through from every angle, getting bogged down in detail and sending things back to committee over and over again. Because projects seem incomplete, even when others deem them finalized, you have difficulty with the closure of old tasks and the initiation of a new one.

_Bruxelles, 28 nov 15:18 - (Agenzia Nova)_ - Dendias ha detto di non capire perché la Grecia dovrebbe sollevare la questione con Berlino, affermando "la Germania si dovrebbe rendere conto da sola, dai controlli e dagli equilibri del proprio sistema, che certe attività non sono compatibili con il suo ruolo in Europa". Nell'intervista, Dendias ha invitato i leader dell'Ue a inviare un messaggio chiaro alla Turchia al vertice del Consiglio europeo del mese prossimo, ma non ha chiesto esplicitamente delle sanzioni. Secondo il ministro, l'Europa dovrebbe dare una "risposta logica" alle recenti azioni della Turchia. In caso contrario “l'Europa invierebbe il messaggio sbagliato a tutti i Paesi della regione più ampia. Ovvero che chi agisce in modo arbitrario, chi viola il diritto internazionale, chi ricatta, alla fine rimane impunito o addirittura viene ricompensato". Dendias ha rifiutato di specificare quale dovrebbe essere il messaggio dell'Ue e ha detto che dovrebbe dipendere dal fatto che la Turchia mostri un reale cambiamento di atteggiamento nei prossimi giorni e settimane. Infine, il ministro ha detto di essere impaziente di lavorare con il presidente eletto degli Stati Uniti, Joe Biden, e con il suo candidato a segretario di Stato, Antony Blinken. "Credo che la regione abbia bisogno della presenza degli Stati Uniti e in particolare della sua presenza militare, così da compensare la mancanza di presenza militare europea nella regione", ha detto Dendias.

FAISALABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 28th Nov, 2020 ) :Punjab government has introduced a modern smart e-card scheme to solve the problems related to social security of daily wage earners and their 100 percent registration.


  Under this scheme, the employer will have to pay only the contribution for the same period in which he had hired a laborer.


  This was stated by Rana Riaz Ahmed, Director Punjab Employees Social Security Institution (PESSI) Faisalabad during a meeting at Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FCCI) on Saturday.


  Director PESSI highlighted the importance of social security and said that employees and employers are two wheels of the same vehicle and close liaison is need of the hour. He said that the employers actually make their employees and their families entitled to all kinds of medical and other benefits by giving a monthly contribution of Rs. 1200 for their employees.


  He termed the e-card as a revolutionary step of Punjab government and said that the holders of e-card would be able to avail modern medical treatment in social security hospitals, dispensaries and medical centers while in case of illness the workers would be paid wage of 121 days at rate of 75% in a year. Similarly, the facility of ambulances equipped with modern equipment in dispensaries and hospitals will also be provided round the clock.

TORTOLA — Imagine your plane backing away from the gate a continent away from home. At first you might think it’s homesickness that has you convinced the announcement over the plane’s PA system seems to have a bit of a familiar accent. But, if you caught a recent American Airlines flight from San Francisco, you wouldn’t have been mistaken.
 The flight featured not just one pilot from the British Virgin Islands, but three.
 BVI natives Capt. Kennard deCastro, 51, and First Officer Alvason Davies, 52, piloted a three-day cross-country voyage from New York’s LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte and on to San Francisco where they were joined by a third BVI native — First Officer Derrick Varlack, 32, — for the return flight. It marked the first time the territory’s natives had flown together in the cockpit on American Airlines.

Ms Sturgeon said: "I do think at Christmas it is important that, rather than leave people with restrictions that are so tight that many people will try to get round (them) in order to see loved ones at Christmas, it is better to do what we've tried to do all along and treat people like grown ups, and say, 'Okay, here is perhaps a bit of leeway that as long as we all behave responsibly within, allows us to have some time with loved ones.

DeCastro, who has been flying planes for the last 41 years, said he began taking flying lessons at 10, got his license at 18 and has worked as a pilot for the last 33 years, with 21 of those years with American Airlines.
 “My first job was flying twin otters for Virgin Islands Airways between Tortola, Virgin Gorda and San Juan around 1993,” he said.
 Davies, who has known deCastro for more than 30 years, said they’ve been looking forward to flying together after Davis joined American Airlines.
 “It was a really good feeling and humbling honor for us to have flown across the country together as professional pilots,” said Davies, who also flies the Airbus family of aircrafts that includes the A319, A320 and A321.
 “It was also great having our other Virgin Islands colleague — Derrick also an American Airlines pilot — join us on one of our flight segments. Having all three of us from the Virgin Islands together on the flight deck at the same time was truly an honor not only for us but also for the BVI,” Davies said. “I look forward to the time when we could fly together again.”
 He hopes to see more young BVIslanders follow in their footsteps.
 “I also would encourage more of our young men and women to pursue a career in aviation and take the territory further than where we have gone,” Davies said.
 Varlack, based in Miami and who recently requalified to pilot AA’s 737 plane after flying the 757/767, flies regularly into St. Thomas and St. Croix. He also posted a photo on his social media page heralding the moment the three British Virgin Islands natives, now pilots, shared the flight deck together. The trio are among American Airlines’ 13,000 pilots, he said.
 The photo caption read: “I’ve had many special moments throughout my career, but this, there are no words.” Varlack told The Daily News that he knew deCastro had been trying to get the trio to fly together for some time ever since he joined American two years ago.
 Prior to that, he said, he piloted planes for nine years for American Eagle and U.S. Air.
 “When it did [happen], I was ecstatic,” Varlack said. “We don’t fly the same aircraft type, so I knew I couldn’t be his First Officer, but this was indeed a moment in BVI history that I had to be part of.”
 He added that friends and family praised the milestone.
 “My American [stateside] friends thought it was cool. My BVI friends and family saw it as a moment of pride as I did,” he said. “The out pouring of congratulatory sentiments has been pretty amazing.”

For the last several months, my weekly “All Bad Cards” games have been like a regular gathering among friends at a bar. We joke. We tease. We tell bawdy jokes and we laugh, forgetting for a couple of hours that the world seems to be coming apart around us. It’s a taste of those human connections that the pandemic has robbed from us.
 My regular group is made up of two therapists, an emergency room nurse, a community college instructor, a caregiver and a sales account manager, among others. On the game website, we give ourselves less-professional-sounding monikers like JoJo Rabbit, Gale Wild, Mr. Ed and Cactus Carlos.
 Players take turns reading prompts, which are structured as fill-in-the-blank sentences. Each other player looks at the response options on the virtual cards in their hand and picks one they think fills in the blank in a funny way. The prompt reader’s favorite wins the round.
 The prompts are usually very staid. One example: “I love ____, it gives me such comfort.”
