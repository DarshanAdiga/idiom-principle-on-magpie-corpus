It comes three months after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police set off demonstrations around the United States and touched off a wider reckoning on race.

The new offensive coordinator in Jacksonville is Jay Gruden. Gruden prompted the team to sign the oft-injured Chris Thompson, a player who is much more a natural fit for third downs and pass-catching than Fournette is. From 2015-18, spanning four seasons, Thompson lead the Gruden-coached Washington team in backfield targets despite never attempting more than 68 rushes. In fact, Gruden has never had a lead running back tally more than 26 targets.
 Le’Veon Bell, Melvin Gordon, David Johnson and Todd Gurley are other examples of running backs that we don’t want on our fantasy team at their current cost in fantasy drafts.
 If you still do not buy that you should avoid running backs in the early-to- mid rounds of your drafts, this is the simplest way to explain it: if the Saints’ Mike Thomas misses three games, Emmanuel Sanders doesn’t become the best WR in fantasy football.
 If Ezekiel Elliott misses time, Tony Pollard might be the favorite to lead the NFL in fantasy points while Elliott is sidelined. It is as simple as that; your waiver wire dollars are going to be better spot on replacement RBs than WRs and the injury fill-in RBs are going to be a more stable source of points than injury fill-in WRs.

One of our top targets at RB is the Los Angeles Rams’ Cam Akers. Coach Sean McVay has hinted that Akers, John Kelly, Malcolm Brown, and Darrell Henderson will see significant snaps in 2020.
 The Rams used a second-round pick on Akers after spending a second-round pick on Henderson and then playing him behind Brown as a rookie.
 The Rams spent a premium pick on Akers, who is one of the best RB prospects we have seen over the past several years. Akers was far and away the most dominant rusher in his backfield at Florida State, totaling 87% of the team’s RB production in his junior season.
 Boston Scott is another example of a true sleeper at the running back position that should be part of our “Modified Zero RB” builds.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Jerry Falwell Jr. said Tuesday that he has resigned as head of evangelical Liberty University because of ongoing controversies about his wife’s sexual involvement with a younger business partner and in the wake of a social media photo that caused an uproar.Falwell’s exit marks a precipitous fall from power for one of the country’s most visible evangelical leaders and ardent supporters of President Donald Trump. The Lynchburg, Virginia, university was founded by Falwell’s late father, the Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr.Falwell confirmed his decision in an interview with The Associated Press. According to the school, he initially offered to resign Monday, hours after the Reuters news agency published an interview with a man who said that he had a yearslong sexual relationship with Becki Falwell and that Jerry Falwell participated in some of the liaisons as a voyeur. Falwell later reversed course, and began telling news outlets he had no intention of leaving. Liberty University spokesman Scott Lamb did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.Falwell had already been on leave since earlier this month after a photo he posted on social media caused an uproar. The latest controversy began to unfold late Sunday, when The Washington Examiner published a lengthy statement from Falwell disclosing that his wife had an extramarital affair. The statement, later shared with the AP, said the man involved had been threatening to reveal the relationship “to deliberately embarrass my wife, family, and Liberty University unless we agreed to pay him substantial monies.”Falwell said he was seeking mental health counseling after dealing with fallout from the affair, which he said he had no role in.“Over the course of the last few months ... we have decided the only way to stop this predatory behavior is to go public,” the statement said.But on Monday, Reuters published Giancarlo Granda’s account of the relationship, including what the news agency said was an audio recording of a phone call between both the Falwells and Granda.The tale of Granda’s ties to the family, previously reported in part by other news outlets, has become known as the “pool boy” story. Granda and the Falwells met while he worked as a pool attendant in Miami.Granda, who did not return a call from AP on Tuesday, took on partial ownership of a hostel in Miami’s party-friendly South Beach neighborhood with members of the Falwell family, according to court documents. The purchase of the property was a surprise move in itself for the president of a conservative evangelical university. Granda’s later involvement sparked legal jostling that later involved Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and fixer.Falwell started an indefinite leave of absence as president and chancellor on Aug. 7, after a photo he posted on social media sparked an uproar. The image showed him with his pants unzipped, stomach exposed and arm high around the waist of his wife’s pregnant assistant. Falwell has said the photo was taken at a costume party during a family vacation.Critics of the photo said it was evidence of hypocritical behavior from the leader of a university where students must follow a strict code of conduct that includes modest dress and a ban on alcohol consumption and premarital sex. The photo also prompted new pushback against Falwell from school alumni and supporters, including North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Walker, who called for his resignation.Liberty alumni and Virginia pastor Colby Garman tweeted on Monday night that the events which brought Falwell down “are not the public fall of a Christian leader into sin.”“They are the unmasking of a long-standing hypocrisy that has fed off the resources and goodwill of a Christian institution while despising the truths it was established to uphold,” Garman wrote.The Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr. had aspired to make Liberty University an academic and athletic leader for evangelicals in the vein of the University of Notre Dame, an academic bastion for Roman Catholics. The younger Falwell’s success in shoring up the school’s finances after he took over in 2007 following his father’s death bolstered his standing among the school’s board members.But as his propensity toward divisive public behavior grew — and particularly following his endorsement of Trump in early 2016 — a number of alumni and staff became dissatisfied with the university’s direction under Falwell.Several of Falwell’s more incendiary recent public statements were connected to his political conservatism and his support for Trump. Falwell tweeted last year that Southern Baptist pastor David Platt should “grow a pair” after Platt acknowledged tension caused by Trump’s visit to his church. This summer, Falwell drew a public rebuke from 35 Black Liberty University alumni after responding to a mask mandate by Virginia’s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, with a tweet invoking the blackface scandal that nearly forced Northam from office.LeeQuan McLaurin resigned earlier this year as Liberty’s director of diversity retention and decried what he has described as the school’s disinterest in working toward racial equality and inclusion. Racism “has always been an issue for Liberty, and they have always ignored it because they knew that they could,” McLaurin said.“However, they knew they could not simply ignore sexual immorality since that has been a longstanding value held by the church, and many of the donors of the institution,” McLaurin added.___Schor reported from New York.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

Matthew McConaughey just wrote a book called "Greenlights" and I was thinking about that idea. You expect a take sometimes to be a bunch of green lights and things are just clicking in and you kind of catch a wave. I remember that day, I walked into the first take -- I don't like to rehearse, and I like to create the dynamic in the environment as much as possible. So they had filled up the room with the press and I walked in and I sat down and I started the take and the microphones weren't live. They were prop microphones. And it really, really threw me in a way that I wasn't prepared for. I assumed the environment would just be real.

Lionel Messi has told Barcelona he wants to leave the club after nearly two decades with the Spanish giants.
 The club confirmed to The Associated Press on Tuesday that the Argentina great sent a document expressing his desire to leave.
 The announcement comes 11 days after Barcelona’s humiliating 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals, one of the worst defeats in the player’s career and in the club’s history.
 The defeat capped a difficult season for Barcelona — the first without a title since 2007-08 — and ignited one of its worst crises ever.

Our favorite sleeper wide receiver is Jacksonville’s Laviska Shenault. With Shenault, we have an elite prospect who was drafted highly coming into a team that is projected to be above league average in terms of passes thrown and who likely doesn’t have much competition for targets especially in the back half of the 2020 season.
 The team could move on from Dede Westbrook and if Shenault is in fact good, Chris Conley will not be a playing-time obstacle. There is also the scenario where the team looks at how poor Leonard Fournette was on the goal line in 2019 (23 rushing attempts inside the 10 and only three touchdowns) and chooses to occasionally use Shenaul the way he was used in college.
 Given how cheap Shenault is in drafts in 2020, he is one player you should guarantee that you leave every single fantasy football draft with.
 An example of a player that we are avoiding is the New Orleans Saints’ Emmanuel Sanders. Taking Sanders as likely the fourth option on an increasingly more-ground heavy team is really rooting for the friendliest loss. The selection won’t ruffle any feathers, but you’re so unlikely to generate any positive value with the pick.

TORONTO - The self-regulatory organization that oversees investment dealers and their trading activity in Canada says a merger with the Mutual Fund Dealers Association would save as much as half a billion dollars over 10 years.
 IIROC — the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada — says a study conducted by Deloitte LLP shows that a consolidation of the two regulators would result in savings of between $380 million and $490 million for the financial services industry.
 It says the savings would come from cutting expenses related to running two platforms to comply with overlapping regulation, adding the merger would benefit investors by giving access to more investment solutions and advice, while advisers would have more flexibility to expand and there would be less regulatory fragmentation.
 IIROC, which commissioned the report, sets and enforces rules for 175 Canadian investment firms and their nearly 30,000 investment advisers, while also setting integrity rules regarding trading activity on Canadian markets. The MFDA oversees about 90 Canadian mutual fund dealers and their 80,000 salespeople.
 The Canadian Securities Administrators, which represents provincial and territorial securities commissions, is in the midst of a review of the regulatory framework for IIROC and MFDA.
 The MFDA recommends building a new organization from scratch, while IIROC favours a merger without changes to existing rules and fees.
 IIROC is recognized by all 13 provincial and territorial jurisdictions and the MFDA is recognized by just eight provinces.

In addition to hiring Matt Rhule and signing Teddy Bridgewater, the team also brought in the mastermind of LSU’s offensive resurgence in Joe Brady. Likely the biggest change from the 2019 Panthers horizontal passing game is how willing Rhule and Brady will be to throw down the field.
 The recipe of improved QB play, an innovative and pass-heavy offensive coordinator, new head coach, and his good performance (even without any touchdowns to speak of) through two seasons make Moore a slam-dunk pick in the third round of any fantasy football draft.
 Marquise Brown is another player that we should make our priority. Without even getting into arguments about pedigree, size, or talent, the simplest explanation for why Marquise Brown is about to take off is that Brown averaged 8.2 yards per target and scored seven touchdowns as a rookie despite getting injured.
 In the midst of that season, Brown racked up 1.81 yards per route run which ranked 33rd in the NFL. That was more than Odell Beckham, D.J Chark, D.K. Metcalf, and Tyler Boyd.

SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif. (AP) — Crews aided by better weather and reinforcements with bulldozers made progress Tuesday penning in massive California wildfires that have killed at least seven people and burned nearly 1,300 homes and other buildings.Firefighters in wine country north of San Francisco had cleared containment lines — used to prevent fires from spreading — around a quarter of that blaze, which has scorched more than 550 square miles (1,424 square kilometers) and destroyed more than 930 buildings.To the east of San Francisco, firefighters had created containment lines around 15% of a group of fires that has charred more than 568 square miles (1,471 square kilometers) and is now the third-largest in state history.And to the south, officials said progress was made against a fire in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties that has grown to 123 square miles (318.5-square-kilometer), destroyed 330 structures and threatens another 25,000.Helicopters dropped 200,000 gallons (over 757,000 litres) of water on the blaze Monday, making it “the best day yet,” said Mark Brunton, operations chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.“The past couple days we’ve seen significant progress in our firefight on this incident,” Brunton said. “The weather’s really cooperating with us.”Temperatures have cooled in the region and lightning strikes, which started many of the fires, have stopped. Fire crews along with bulldozers were arriving from other states, but officials warned the danger was far from over and admonished residents to stay out of evacuated areas. Six people who returned to the restricted area north of Santa Cruz to check on their properties were surprised by fire and had to be rescued, authorities said.Looters have been warned they’ll be arrested, and some people have been taken into custody, including a man found with $5,000 in his car, authorities said. Detectives were also investigating seven reports of missing people.Evacuees tempted to return to check on their homes should think again, fire officials said.“It is highly dangerous in there still,” Jonathan Cox, a Cal Fire deputy chief, said of the blaze north of Santa Cruz, adding that some old wooden bridges have failed but might appear to be safe.An estimated 170,000 people remained under evacuation orders and tens of thousands of homes were still threatened from fires around the state.Elinor Slayer and her four children fled her home last week in the redwood-dotted mountain town of Boulder Creek north of Santa Cruz when they started seeing burnt leaves and large pieces of ash.“Luckily for me, I have a 13-year-old daughter who is very cautious about wildfires. We had bags packed already,” said Slayer, 48. “We hadn’t gotten an evacuation order yet but my daughter said, ‘It’s time to go.’”The family is counting their blessings that everyone is safe and hoping their home is, too, Slayer said. “We don’t know what we’re going to return to,” she said.The siege of wildfires in the state has been astonishing, especially since California’s peak fire season usually is during the hot, windy days of September and October.Gov. Gavin Newsom said at this time last year, California had seen about 4,300 wildfires that burned about 88 square miles (227 square kilometers), while the toll so far this year is 7,000 fires and nearly 2,200 square miles (5,698 square kilometers).“We are dealing with different climate conditions that are precipitating in fires the likes we haven’t seen in modern recorded history,” he said Monday.The fires are blamed for at least seven deaths, among them 70-year-old Mary Hintemeyer, her boyfriend Leo McDermott and his son, Tom, said Hintemeyer’s son, Robert McNeal.McNeal told KPIX-TV that he lost contact with his mother last week as the fires sped up. He said she had tried to go into town earlier that day but turned back at a roadblock where authorities said if she went through she wouldn’t be allowed back. She returned home to get her boyfriend, who was in a wheelchair.Authorities found their remains among the ruins on the Napa County property the following day.“Just get out, don’t wait,” McNeal told the TV station, urging people to follow evacuation orders. “If you think it’s going to be too much to get your sprinklers on before you get out of there, forget those too. Forget it. Get out. Just get out. It ain’t worth it.”Authorities identified another victim as Tad Jones, 73. His body was found Sunday near his van in the remote Last Chance area of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Police had to use a helicopter to reach the roughly 40 off-the-grid homes at the end of a winding, steep dirt road.The&nbsp;Santa Cruz Sentinel&nbsp;wrote about Jones in 2009 after he survived another fire. Jones was a Vietnam veteran who had not spoken since 1976 after he met the late silent monk Baba Hari Dass and went into the woods to practice silence, the Sentinel reported.___Associated Press writers John Antczak and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles, Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco and Aron Ranen in Healdsburg, California, contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Of course, we all know what actually happened.
 Climate change took a backseat to the pandemic, which has dominated the public's imagination and government agendas for months. As the House of Commons shut down in late March, in response to the first surge of COVID-19 cases, officials postponed tabling the 2020 budget that was going to be centered around climate change.
 Other significant milestones were also pushed back. The annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26), marking five years since the Paris Agreement, was delayed, giving countries at least another year before they will have to commit to new, more ambitious plans for how they will curb global warming.
 Canada's plan for reaching its 2030 target has been delayed by months, along with appointing an expert panel to advise how to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, however both will be a top priority in the coming months, said Wilkinson.
 "This will be one of the first orders of business and certainly for Canada our highest priority in terms of new legislation when the house comes back in the fall," he said, adding that because of the pandemic, there's now greater motivation within the government to tackle climate change.
 "COVID-19 is a global crisis that came on quite quickly, but we know climate change is a global crisis in the making that is going to have more devastating impacts.
 "It has given us even more impetus to say we must move forward. It will require investments to address reducing emissions and enabling productivity and competitiveness in the Canadian economy going forward."

As South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster prepared to announce the end of a coronavirus stay-at-home order, his top staff received an email from the state health department.
   
 The message, highlighted in bold, was clear: Wait longer before allowing customers back inside restaurants, hair salons and other businesses where people will be in close contact.
   
 Instead, McMaster pressed ahead with a plan written by the state restaurant association to resume inside dining on May 11. The guidelines made masks optional for employees and allowed more customers inside than the health agency had advised.
   
 A few days later, the Republican governor opened the doors to salons, fitness centers and swimming pools. He did not wait to gauge the effect of the restaurant reopening on the virus, as public health officials had suggested.
   
 Like many states, South Carolina later experienced a surge in infections that forced McMaster to dial back his reopening plan.
   
 He was hardly alone. Thousands of pages of emails provided to The Associated Press under open-records laws show that governors across the U.S. were inundated with reopening advice from a wide range of industries -- from campgrounds in New Hampshire to car washes in Washington.
   
 Some governors put economic interests ahead of public health guidance, and certain businesses were allowed to write the rules that would govern their own operations.
   
 As job losses accelerated, the pressure to reopen intensified.
   
 "Attraction folks are on me like white on rice," McMaster's tourism director wrote to the head of the governor's reopening task force, describing lobbying from amusement parks, bingo halls and other entertainment venues.
   
 Though governors often work with business leaders to craft policy, the emails offer a new window into their decisions during a critical early juncture in the nation's battle against the pandemic.
   
 Many governors chose to reopen before their states met all the nationally recommended health guidelines, which include a sustained downward rate of infection and robust testing and contact tracing.
   
 "The interest in trying to reopen and restart economic activity had a much greater pull at the time ... than did public health concerns or question marks about how it would go," said Anita Cicero, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.
   
 Many states were forced to halt or roll back their reopening plans as COVID-19 cases spiked across the country this summer, and the number of infections and deaths in the U.S. far outpaced those of any other country.
   
 In early August, McMaster transformed his restaurant guidelines into requirements, including a mandate that all diners and employees wear masks. The governor's spokesman, Brian Symmes, said "some restaurants weren't doing what they needed to do."
   
 Symmes also defended the spring reopening, saying the governor "has a wider scope of responsibility and focus than our public health officials."
   
 "It simply isn't the government's job to put its thumb on the scale by shuttering these small businesses for an undefined and indefinite period of time," Symmes said.
   
 Two weeks after North Dakota reopened, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum received a report showing a single-day spike of 69 new COVID-19 cases in one county.
   
 Burgum fired off an email to several of his top officials complaining that the outbreak -- combined with lower-than-promised daily COVID-19 testing -- was "driving our state numbers in the wrong direction."
   
 "Our house is on fire," Burgum wrote, accompanied by a fire emoji. "Need to drive a much greater sense of urgency and action."
   
 North Dakota was among at least 15 states that provided records to the AP at no cost. A few states wanted hundreds or thousands of dollars to supply copies of the communications that could reveal how governors were making decisions -- and which voices influenced them the most.
   
 Some states suspended or slowed responses to open-records requests because of the coronavirus. Three months after submitting its request, the AP is still awaiting records from many states, including Texas and Florida, which have some of the highest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. California denied the AP's request, because state law shields correspondence involving the governor's office from public disclosure.
   
 "In a pandemic, you need more transparency, more information -- not less of either one of those," said Dan Bevarly, executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition.
   
 As she was putting the finishing touches on a reopening plan in May, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown received a letter from a coalition of business groups pressing for more say in the process. Two hours later, the head of the state hospital association wrote urging the Democrat to mandate masks as "foundational to any business opening where people will be gathered, indoors or out."
   
 At first, Brown required masks only for employees of certain businesses, but she had to reverse course as COVID-19 cases rose over the summer. She became one of 34 governors to impose statewide mask mandates.
   
 In Washington state, landscapers, dog walkers and car wash operators all had a role in the rules affecting their businesses, according to the emails provided by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee's administration.
   
 Lance Odermat, vice president of Brown Bear Car Wash in Seattle, said he was frustrated that car washes were not exempt from Inslee's order shutting down many businesses in March. But Odermat continued to plead his case. He was included in a car-wash reopening group and sent the administration the company's internal plan for reopening with coronavirus precautions.
   
 When the governor released his reopening strategy, "it seemed like a lot of those guidelines were taken directly from our operating plan," Odermat said.
   
 In North Carolina, the head of a restaurant association sent a copy of the group's reopening plan to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's chief of staff on April 24 and warned in a letter the following week that the outlook for restaurants "becomes more dire" with each passing day. She also served on a state task force that helped shape the guidelines Cooper eventually issued, which allowed in-person dining to resume with up to 50% of fire-code capacity and tables spaced at least 6 feet apart.
   
 The tensions between economic and health interests were evident in New Hampshire in a decision allowing campgrounds to open with restricted capacities.
   
 Margaret Byrnes, executive director of the New Hampshire Municipal Association, urged Republican Gov. Chris Sununu's administration to keep campgrounds closed because of concerns they could attract visitors from areas with higher coronavirus caseloads. She also wanted cities to have a greater voice on the governor's reopening task force.
   
 "There was a lot of business and industry representation, which is really important in the reopening process, but it needed to be balanced with some local municipal representation," Byrnes said.
   
 Sununu's policy director, D.J. Bettencourt, said municipalities were represented on the task force through lawmakers who doubled as local officials. He said opening campgrounds on May 1 was "an essential aspect of ensuring housing" for some health care workers and guarding against homelessness.
   
 Back in South Carolina, the director of the state Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism said in an April 27 email that he had asked the restaurant association to "create a plan for the 'new dining room'" guidelines. The association proposed to resume indoor dining May 11, according to the email.
   
 On May 1, the health department chief of staff emailed the governor's top staff saying the agency recommended waiting until May 18 to resume indoor dining. The agency also recommended a 25% capacity limit for restaurants, with no more than six people per table and mandatory masks for employees.
   
 But the governor's final plan, announced a week later, stuck with the May 11 start date, a 50% capacity guideline and up to eight people per table. There were no mandates, and the entire policy was only a suggestion.
   
 How closely did McMaster's restaurant guidelines mirror the industry's plan?
   
 "Oh, it was exactly," said Douglas OFlaherty, vice president of the restaurant organization. "He basically said, 'What the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association's recommendations are, you should follow.'"
