Over the past number of years, there has been a trend, and a market, for adults to journal. To have journals of gratitude and to have an outlet to express feelings with the hope that we are maintaining better mental health.
 There are so many books on the market aimed at people who want to journal and use it as part of their mindfulness routine.
 I personally haven’t tried it so I won’t knock it, and I do have a few friends who find it really helpful and relaxing.
 This past week, a new journaling book came across my desk at work, but what caught my attention is that it is aimed at children.
 Published by simplyhappykids.co.uk it is a journal that stars a fictional character called Sunny who encourages kids to keep track of their feelings and thoughts and do daily affirmations.
 I brought it home over the weekend and gave it to my daughter, Joan, to read and explore.
 The book starts with a guide for parents recommending us to spend at least 10 minutes a day with our kids completing the exercises in the book. The aim is to help our children develop habits to help them maintain a healthy mind and become good communicators.
 On the second page of the book is Sunny’s tips which are simply lovely. They include encouraging children to ‘have respect and be kind to everyone they meet’’, to ‘be unique’, and the wise words of ‘if you don’t try you will never know!”
 Joan instantly loved the journal, and the fact that it was hers to write in and read as she wants.
 The first exercise in the book is for each child to share their own tips with Sunny, so I left Joan alone to write hers. It warmed my heart to read what she wrote.

Biden’s emphasis, as he has signaled, will be on slowing down the spread of the virus by universal masking and locking up and shutting down sectors of the American economy.
 Yet, even as the worst of the pandemic appears directly ahead in December and January, the last six weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency, the light at the end of the tunnel may be sighted within Biden’s first 100 days.
 The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which have proven 90-95% effective against the virus, begin to come on line this month. By the end of Biden’s first 100 days, May 1, the beneficial effect of scores of millions of vaccinations should be visible to all, and the pandemic should be seen as irretrievably receding.
 At least, that is the hope and expectation. And the media would naturally attribute the new dawn not to the triumph of Trump’s Operation Warp Speed but to the new president.
 Biden’s response to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will almost surely be along the lines of what Congress is now debating, contingent upon whether Mitch McConnell is prepared to accept what comes over from the House.
 A trillion-dollar package seems baked in the cake, as the country would not long tolerate congressional inaction if the pandemic were still raging through the population as it is today.
 As for racial inequality, the pandemic has exposed, deepened and widened it. The surge in shootings and killings in major cities during the pandemic is hitting the Black communities hardest.
 The decline in test scores at schools where kids have been kept away from formal classes since March is most pronounced among minorities. Black and Hispanic workers in service industries are a disproportionate share of the victims of the pandemic.
 If half a century of social progress after the civil rights revolution of the ‘60s and eight years of the first Black president have failed to reduce racial disparities in income, wealth, employment and incarcerations, does anyone believe Joe Biden has the solution?

The Trump administration is planning an unprecedented five more federal executions before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, starting with a Texas street-gang member set to be put to death Thursday for his role in the 1999 slayings of an Iowa religious couple whose bodies he burned in the trunk of their car.
 Brandon Bernard was 18 when he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley on their way from a Sunday service in Killeen, Texas. He would be the ninth federal inmate put to death since July, when President Donald Trump ended a 17-year hiatus in federal executions.
 If Bernard, now 40, receives a lethal injection as planned at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, it would be a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when the crime occurred.
 Federal executions during a presidential transfer of power also are rare, especially during a transition from a death-penalty proponent to a president- elect like Biden opposed to capital punishment. The last time executions occurred in a lame-duck period was during the presidency of Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.
 Defense attorneys have argued in court and in a petition for clemency from Trump that Bernard was a low-ranking, subservient member of the group. They say both Bagleys were likely dead before Bernard doused their car with lighter fluid and set it on fire, a claim that conflicts with government testimony at trial. Bernard, they say, has repeatedly expressed remorse.
 “I can’t imagine how they feel about losing their family,” Bernard said about surviving Bagley relatives in a 2016 video statement from death row. I wish that we could all go back and change it. He also described taking part in youth outreach programs and embracing religion, saying, I have tried to be a better person since that day.
 The case has prompted calls for Trump to intervene, including from one prosecutor at his 2000 trial who now says racial bias may have influenced the nearly all-white jury’s imposition of a death sentence against Bernard, who is Black. Several jurors have also since said publicly that they regret not opting for life in prison instead.
 Reality TV star Kim Kardashian is among those who have asked Trump to stop the execution, saying in a series of recent tweets that Bernard’s role was minor compared to that of the other teens involved. The Justice Department refused to delay Thursday’s execution of Bernard, another inmate on Friday and three more in January, even after eight officials who participated in an execution last month tested positive for the coronavirus. The eight federal executions in 2020 already is more than in the previous 56 years combined.
 One of Bernard’s co-defendants, Christopher Vialva, was executed in September. Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, released a statement after that execution, saying, “I believe when someone deliberately takes the life of another, they suffer the consequences for their actions.” Prosecutors said Vialva, the oldest of the teens at 19, was the ringleader who shot the Bagleys, as they lay in the trunk before Bernard set the car on fire.
 ## What happened?
 The teenagers, three of whom were under 18, approached the Bagleys in the afternoon on June 21, 1999, and asked them for a lift after they stopped at a convenience store — planning all along to rob the couple. After the Bagleys agreed, Vialva pulled a gun and forced them into the trunk.
 The Bagleys, both of whom were in their 20s, spoke through an opening in the back seat and urged their kidnappers to accept Jesus as they drove around for hours trying to use the Bagleys’ ATM cards. After the teens pulled to the side of the road, Vialva walked to the back and shot the Bagleys in the head.
 The central question in the decision to sentence Bernard to death was whether Vialva’s gunshots or the fire set by Bernard killed the Bagleys.
 Trial evidence showed Todd Bagley likely died instantly. But a government expert said Stacie Bagley had soot in her airway, indicating smoke inhalation and not the gunshot killed her. Defense attorneys have said that assertion wasn’t proven. They’ve also said Bernard believed both Bagleys were dead and that he feared the consequences of refusing the order of the higher ranking Vialva to burn the car to destroy evidence.
 The first series of federal executions over the summer were of white men, which critics said seemed calculated to make them less controversial amid summer protests over racial discrimination. Four of the five inmates set to die before Biden’s January 20 inauguration are Black men. The fifth is a white woman who would be the first female inmate executed by the federal government in nearly six decades.
 The federal prosecutor who now wants a life term for Bernard, Angel Moore, says recent research shows people tend to view Blacks as more to blame than their white counterparts when the facts surrounding a crime are the same, and that young Black men are less likely to be given benefits of the doubt by jurors because of their immaturity.
 “I always took pride in representing the United States as a federal prosecutor, and I think executing Brandon would be a terrible stain on the nation’s honour,” Moore, who is now in private practice in San Antonio, wrote in a recent op-ed in The Indianapolis Star.
 One juror whose 2016 written statement was included in the White House petition said he still believes Bernard is responsible for horrible decisions that had horrendous outcomes.

The court has noted that Prime Minister Imran Khan appears to be running the government through a set of people he has personally selected himself rather than through those elected by the people. The basis of democracy is that government be handled by people who have been voted in through ballots for this purpose. The widespread use of advisers and assistants who have not been elected goes against this principle. While in the past advisers have sat in parliament and in the cabinet to give the government their expert opinion on key issues, they have not taken over the role of ministers. The rules of government lay down that each division or ministry needs to be headed by an official who holds a place in parliament and has been voted in for this purpose. In other words, the presence of such persons gives the country's people a say in the running of government rather than handing this over entirely to one man.


  There is no doubt that so far the current government has acted widely through the use of assistants and advisers on many key matters. The decision also comes at a time when the matter of privatisation is under debate and a committee made up mainly of advisers and assistants is heading this committee. Let us not forget that democracy demands that the vote of the people be counted not only on the day of balloting, but also after it when the time comes to take decisions and run the government. So far, this has not happened because of the presence of the large coterie of assistants and advisers. It is time the government opted to use those who have been voted in to take key decisions and head committees. This must happen sooner rather than later.
