The incentives are reminiscent of those available during the 2008-2009 Great Recession. If you are in-market for a vehicle, then this is a great time to save money on new green wheels, with extended interest-free financing deals, extended warranties, and four-figure cash-back offers.
 Jaguar is offering 0 percent financing for 72 months on its first all-electric production car, the well-regarded I-Pace sport sedan. At the other end of the price spectrum, you can buy a 2019 Chevy Volt hybrid or Bolt EV for that same 0 percent financing deal.
 Audi is offering financing as low as 1.99 percent across the board for its hybrid models, along with cash back up to $3,000, depending on the model, according to Edmunds. Ford hybrids, including the Fusion and Escape, are as low as 0 percent financing, and up to $2,500 cash back.
 Hyundai is offering financing as low as 1.9 percent on 2020 plug-in hybrids including the 2019 and 2020 Ioniq, and as low as 0 percent on the 2019 and 2020 Sonata hybrid and plug-in version, along with substantial cash back up to $6,500.
 Hyundai also is extending its warranty policy for those of us facing difficulties getting service or repair, since some dealerships have closed temporarily. Current Hyundai owners whose warranty is expiring between now and June will have their coverage extended through June 30th.
 Subaru also is extending its warranty program for up to six months, and extending payment extensions of up to 90 days for current owners. New buyers can get long-term, zero-percent financing on some of Subaru's most popular models, including Forester, Outback, Legacy, and Impreza.

Kathi Curry’s father taught her how to drive in a Meadow Green 1955 Ford pickup truck. She learned to shift the F-100 with a four-speed manual transmission with a floor shifter.
 Under the sculpted engine hood was a 120-horsepower Mileage Maker six-cylinder engine. The base price for the truck was $1,460.
 During her last semester at college, “My dad gave me the truck for the semester while he walked to work for the swing shift, rain or shine,” she says. “That’s the kind of dad he was.”
