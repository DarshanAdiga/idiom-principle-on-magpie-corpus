Three major utility companies serving the Seacoast have announced they will suspend electricity and gas service shutoffs as a result of non-payment during the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Eversource, Unitil and Liberty Utilities will all cease service disconnections for the time being.
   
 Eversource serves more than 3.6 million customers in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut; Liberty Utilities serves select communities in New Hampshire and Massachusetts; and Unitil serves customers in Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
   
 In its announcement to customers, Eversource wrote, "To lessen any financial hardship our customers may be facing as a result of the pandemic, we have postponed customer disconnections for nonpayment. We are a part of the communities we serve across New England, and as a provider of essential services, are committed to supporting all of our customers during this uncertain time."
   
 The utility company continued, "Our top priority remains the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities while ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of electric and natural gas service."
   
 Unitil announced all residential and commercial service disconnections have been suspended indefinitely.
   
 Liberty Utilities' announcement echoed Eversource's sentiments, framing the suspension of disconnections as a way to assist those facing financial hardship during the public health emergency.
   
 Central Maine Power is set to submit a request to the Maine Public Utilities Commission to extend the protections afforded residential customers during the winter disconnection period from April 15 to May 15, in recognition of the potential economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "In this unique time of uncertainty over the impacts of COVID-19, we want to reassure customers that we would like to work with them if they are challenged to pay their bills, and would like to extend the period in which disconnections are prohibited until Maine has a better understanding of how people are dealing with the consequences of the pandemic," said David Flanagan, executive board chairman of CMP.
   
 CMP encourages any customer who is challenged to pay their electric bills to call the company to discuss possible sources of assistance and individual payment arrangements.
   
 Some U.S. cities, as well as other countries, have begun to announce major steps to lessen the economic blow of COVID-19. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and major landlords have agreed to halt all evictions, while Italy has suspended mortgage payments. New York City also enacted a moratorium on evictions.

_South Africa is facing a seriouswater problem on many levels. Last year, Cape Town almost ran out of drinking water due to a crippling drought and in areas of the Karoo; farmers talk about an arid future due to climate change that has arrived early. In 2019, only 3 inches of rain fell in Calvinia, the lowest rainfall since the early 1800s, a local farmer told Bloomberg. Added to that, is the inability of many municipalities to supply their residents with clean drinking water leading to some local residents, including farmers and black communities taking matters into their own hands. An example of this is Harrismith, where farmers and the local black community set out to fix water supply and other issues in the town that the local council could not repair due to gross misspending and an allegedly corrupt mayor. The lack of clean drinking water to communities has also led to protests in various parts of the country. But over the local issues, hangs a cloud in the form of corruption on national government level, that Corruption Watch Executive Director, David Lewis calls a ‘woman-made problem’ in a recent report, titled, Money down the Drain. He is referring to former Minister of Water Affairs, Nomvula Mokonyane. Under her watch the Department of Water Affairs had, according to a report by the Auditor-General of South Africa collapsed_ _, with billions of rands of irregular expenditure, huge debts and failed projects. An example of this is the Giyani Water Project that grew from a R502m project to R2.7bn in a year because of irregular contracts. South Africa’s water problem is according to John Kane-Berman a man-made crisis and he suggests that independent water producers similar to those in the energy sector could be the answer.

The local track staged it’s annual Festival Raceday with a healthy turnout of 79 runners across seven races, with all the action from Cheltenham also being shown on big screens.
 There was an immediate link to the Festival when Dagueneau, trained by Emma Lavelle, justified 2/1 favouritism to record his first success over hurdles at the fourth attempt in the opening race.
 The five-year-old carries the now famous colours of Andrew Gemmell who owns Paisley Park, also trained by Lavelle, who was the winner of last year’s Stayers’ Hurdle at Cheltenham and unsuccess-fully defended his crown 24 hours after Dagueneau’s victory at Huntingdon.
 Fresh from the success of Imperial Aura at Cheltenham the previous day, trainer Kim Bailey and jockey David Bass teamed up to land the maiden hurdle over two miles with the 6/5 favourite Rhosneigr.
 Two hours after her husband Harry Skelton had ridden Politologue to victory at Cheltenham in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, Bridget Andrews steered home Faivoir to his third success in the closing National Hunt Flat Race for trainer – and her brother-in-law - Dan Skelton.
 This improving five-year-old was following up a success at Bangor and, despite a seven-pound penalty, comfortably drew clear in the closing stages for an impressive success.
 Earlier in the day, a drop in trip and class suited the Ben Case-trained Midnightreflection, who re-turned as the 7/2 favourite to win the second race, a handicap hurdle for mares’ over two and a half miles, under young jockey Jack Tudor.
 The third race on the card, a handicap hurdle over two miles for female jockeys, was won by Local Affair, who was getting off the mark at the eighth attempt.
 She was ridden by Katie O’Farrell who was recording her first winner in Britain since she joined champion trainer Paul Nicholls last year, after 27 victories in her native Ireland.

The dining room at Meals on Wheels Victoria will close effective Tuesday, the nonprofit said in a news release.
 The nonprofit's meal delivery service to homebound individuals will continue uninterrupted.
 Nonprofits, businesses and groups throughout the country have decided to cancel or postpone in-person events because they can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus, is believed to primarily spread from person to person, according to experts. Federal officials said they expect many people in the U.S. to be exposed to the virus at some point this year or next, but said they do not expect most people to develop serious illness. Older adults and those with long-term health conditions are at greater risk of developing serious illnesses or complications, according to the CDC.
 The decision was made in line with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends that people age 65 and older avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. On Sunday, the CDC issued updated guidance recommending that gatherings of 50 or more people, of any age group, be canceled by organizers for the next 8 weeks.
 Registered clients who would normally eat at the center can pick up their meal to go via curbside pickup as long as they make a reservation at least one day in advance. To make a reservation, clients should call 361-576-2189. Those clients might also be eligible for home-delivered meals and should call Meals on Wheels Victoria to find out if they are eligible.
 "Our clients health and well-being are our utmost concern," Dan Williams- Capone, the executive director of Meals on Wheels Victoria, said in a statement. "We are making these changes to our senior center program out of an abundance of caution."
 The agency is following guidelines from the CDC and the Texas State Health Services for sanitation and safe delivery practices, and contingency plans have been put in place to ensure agency capacity in light of any supply-chain or staff or volunteer disruption, according to the release.
 "We want to reassure all of our homebound clients, that no interruption to their meal service is anticipated," Williams-Capone said.
 He noted that the nonprofit could always use additional volunteers to help with delivery, and those who are interested in helping should contact Diana Alarcon at Meals on Wheels Victoria.
 "This is a fluid situation," Williams-Capone said. "Our goal is to ensure the vulnerable seniors we serve get the support and services they need."

This Amazon production, which premieres as a stream on March 20, is a nicely constructed, low-budget thriller that features many layers that its writing- directing partners Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy manage to keep on an even, slowly unfolding keel. Not surprisingly, it opens in song, on an ocean pier, with a fisherman, accompanied by three other fishermen, belting out the title song.
 But why they're singing it, and why the film takes its name from it, is and will remain a bigger mystery than the multiple mysteries that move the film along.
 The location is the fictional Easter Cove, Maine, where two women, Pris (Sophie Lowe) and her younger sister Mary Beth (Morgan Saylor) - they're known in town as the Connolly girls - are sharing a drink before attending the funeral of their mother.
 Though this appears to be the beginnings of a character study on the differences between the siblings - they're close, but Pris is the responsible one, Mary Beth is the wild child - it soon heads off into all sorts of directions, with many other people.
 Post-funeral, Mary Beth heads for the local bar for a few drinks, but has some trouble with local bad apple Gorski (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who comes on to her, won't let up and - since this happens so early in the film, I'll give it away - is killed by her in self-defense, with a harpoon assist.
 Uh-oh, this is not the kind of thing you want to be caught up in in a small town. Good thing steady-nerved Pris is around to figure out what to do, to put a plan in motion to get rid of the body. But this proves to be no easy feat, and in one of the film's best darkly humorous lines of dialogue, as they're trying to stuff him in a cooler, a shaken Mary Beth says, "What are we supposed to do, Pris? Chop his arms off?"
 Well, yeah! And that very sharp knife with the Connolly fishing business name emblazoned on it should do the trick. And the endless ocean would be a great place to dump the cooler.
 Time to meet more people. There's Enid (Margo Martindale), who runs the Ocean View B&B (which really should be called a B&B&B because it's also a brothel). And there's a trio of longtime residents - Susie, Gail, and Doreen (June Squibb, Annette O'Toole, Marceline Hugot) who seem to know everything about everyone. And there are a couple of cops - one is a regular customer at the B&B&B, the other is an inquisitive man just doing his job.
 Before you can catch a breath, a body washes up onshore, and when the sisters find out, they panic. But it turns out to be a bullet-riddled woman (no harpoon marks!) who worked at the B&B&B, and she wasn't exactly preparing breakfasts or making beds. Look out! Nasty, foul-mouthed working woman Lexie (Gayle Rankin) is soon making things even murkier.
 By the time the expanding series of plotlines introduces a bag with $50,000 cash, and the Connolly knife has gone missing, you're wondering where else this story can possibly turn. Some sleepy little town!
 The film is about all of these people and incidents, but the focus eventually comes around to Enid, and Martindale gives a frightening, multi-textured performance as a powerful woman who's juggling a lot of secrets.
 There are questions everywhere you turn, and just about all of them are answered. But the writers-directors couldn't quite lick the problem of how to end it, and in an attempt to wrap things up, those answers are delivered too quickly, too neatly. And I'm still wondering why the film is called "Blow the Man Down."

With the outdoor spring track and field season beginning, expect to see even more of the same.
 Participating in multiple events can be an organizational and creative challenge, because many are held at the same time. So there has to be some give and take, leniency and understanding among meet officials to allow for those athletes to come and go and have some flexibility.
 If an athlete is running in a relay at the same time the long-jump event is set to close, but has one leap remaining to attempt, what to do? Usually, that is not an issue because of the unwritten leniency agreement.
 Preferably, those multiple-event athletes would like to get a few minutes of rest between events or attempts. But that can’t always be the case, and sometimes just doesn’t happen.
 So they compete anyhow while tired. That’s even more impressive.

ATLANTA - Last year, a General Assembly determined to bring the benefits of high-speed internet to rural Georgia passed legislation authorizing the state’s electric membership corporations (EMCs) to deploy broadband to rural customers.
 Recently a bill that squeaked through the Georgia House of Representatives less than 90 minutes before the annual “Crossover Day” deadline fell aims to give telecom companies the financial incentive to take advantage of the 2019 measure.
 “This is a Hail Mary attempt,” state Rep. Ron Stephens, R-Savannah, the bill’s chief sponsor, said from the House floor just before 11 p.m. last Thursday night, March 12. “Let’s not leave rural Georgia in the dark any more when it comes to broadband.”
 While high-speed internet has become commonplace in metro Atlanta and Georgia’s other urban and suburban communities, school kids in parts of rural Georgia are forced to go to the local library so they can go online and do their homework.
 Lack of adequate internet service makes it difficult for rural development authorities and chambers of commerce to attract new businesses and retain existing ones, Jaeson [CQ] Smith of the Tallapoosa Development Authority in Haralson County told members of a state Senate committee this month.
 “We’ve had the issue of brain drain for the last 50 years, and it’s beginning to choke us,” he said. “We got to have internet. We got to have it a month ago.”
 Broadband enthusiasts attacked the problem last year with Senate Bill 2, which authorized EMCs to deploy broadband service to their customers. Georgia’s 41 EMCs serve more than 4 million customers, primarily in rural communities.
 But with EMCs charging telecom providers $20 and more to attach broadband wire or cable to each utility pole, the providers have been reluctant to take the plunge.
 Lobbyists for the telecom industry told lawmakers they would be willing to launch a major investment in rural broadband if the EMCs lowered pole attachment prices. In a letter late last month, officials with Comcast revealed plans to spend $20 million on broadband deployment in rural Georgia if the attachment fees were reduced enough to justify the cost.
 Michael Power, executive director of the Georgia Cable Association, said lower attachment fees would free up savings to provide broadband to 35,000 homes and businesses.
 “Every dollar we save [on pole attachment fees] would allow the business of cable to deploy [broadband] in Georgia,” he said.
 Sen. John Kennedy, R-Macon, introduced legislation last month requiring pole attachment fees to comply with a standard set by the Federal Communications Commission, which would represent a significant reduction from the fees EMCs have been collecting.
 However, representatives of the EMCs complained a major drop in the fees would cause revenue losses they would have to pass on to their customers. As nonprofits, EMCs have no shareholders to absorb such costs.
 The situation was further complicated when Sen. Steve Gooch, R-Dahlonega, who has made expanding rural broadband a top priority, pushed through a substitute to Kennedy’s bill this month requiring EMCs to provide pole attachments for free. However, the offer was to apply only in rural areas lacking broadband service, meaning telecom providers would have to pay EMCs the going rate to run broadband through suburban communities to get to those unserved rural areas.
 Lobbyists for both the EMCs and the telecom industry had reason for concern about the new substitute. With the two sides unable to agree, the full Senate tabled the bill on the afternoon of Crossover Day, and the push for rural broadband appeared to be dead.
 That left it to the House to resurrect the legislation. After sitting on the sidelines throughout the session, supporters in the House grabbed a bill left over from last year and essentially rewrote it.
 As Stephens explained it Thursday night, March 12, the legislation calls for the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) to set pole attachment rates after all current contracts between EMCs and telecom providers expire. He said representatives of both sides had agreed with the bill’s provisions.
 “A lot of plans have been put on the table,” House Majority Leader Jon Burns, R-Newington, said during Thursday’s night, March 12, brief floor debate. “This seems to be the one that’s got the most traction.”
 Despite the airing of concerns over the new regulatory authority the bill would give the PSC, the House passed it 116-44. The legislation now moves to the Senate.

Dundee's boys basketball team walked off the court to cheers Wednesday night after defeating Milan to earn a spot in the District finals against Airport.
 There was a feeling of positivity that something special was in the works for the Vikings.
 "We felt confident," said Dundee assistant coach Travis Pant. "Just based off what we saw Wednesday night, how we played, and our common opponents (with Airport), we were confident. We thought we had a good shot to win a District title."
 Less than 24 hours later, all of that was gone.
 The Michigan High School Athletic Association announced Thursday that all winter sports tournaments and the start of the spring sports season would be on hold indefinitely due to fears over the coronavirus epidemic.
 "It was rough," Pant said. "We practiced Thursday and nobody knew what was going on. Was it just postponed? Was it going to be canceled? We didn't know the extent of it."
 There is a consensus feeling that basketball will not resume, but the uncertainty over the season's official status and the delayed start to the spring has left many Monroe County Region athletes in limbo.
 Pant, who also coaches Summerfield's baseball team, found himself in a particularly tough position.
 "It was shock, that was the biggest feeling," Pant said. "There was some excitement Thursday because I got my first full practice with my team and the kids were ready to get after it, but it was tough for the kids. They've put in a lot of work to this point and now they have to take a break."
 That practice would be Pant's first and last for at least the next few weeks. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the closure of all public schools until at least April 6. Along with that decision, the MHSAA ruled that all spring practices would be shut down as well.
 "It was definitely disappointing, but it didn't stop us," said Summerfield senior Brendan Dafoe. "We went out as a team without the coaches. They weren't allowed to come out and coach but we figured the season wasn't ending, so we went out and practiced anyway."
 The students on the team plan to continue their practices and preseason preparations for whenever the baseball season resumes.
 The team can't afford to take any breaks. Summerfield won a Division 3 state championship last season and graduated only one starter. The Bulldogs feel the window to defend their championship and win back-to-back titles is wide open.
 "We have pretty lofty goals," Pant said. "It's tough for those guys because they were definitely excited to get back to where we were last year. We thought we had a really good chance. They want another ring.
 "We know we had a legitimate chance of doing something special, winning back to back. Not meany teams can do that."
 After the team's player-only practice on Friday, the group got back together that night to watch a video of their state championship run and then take swings off a tee even as the sun started to set.
 "It was getting us amped up for the season," Dafoe said. "We have a lot of people on the team who really care about baseball. It was disappointing how the basketball season ended, but we still have something to look forward to that most teams don't."
 While Summerfield can turn its focus completely to baseball, there are other Monroe County Region teams who are caught in the middle.
 Erie Mason's basketball team was set to play for a District championship Friday against Blissfield before the game was called off. There are seven players on the the Eagles' basketball team who also play baseball.
 "I'm definitely still hoping basketball can come back, so my mind is still on the basketball season," said Mason junior Tanner Herrera. "Baseball is still on the back burner right now."
 Mason's basketball team advanced to the state semifinals last season, earning their chance to play at Michigan State's Breslin Center. The Eagles fell just one win short of competing for a state title.
 Herrera said the team felt it had a good chance to make another run at the crown.
 "We thought we had something special this year and then it came to a halt so quickly," Herrera said. "I definitely believe that we could make another run if the season were to continue. We could get there.
 For now, Herrera plans to continue working out at home and keeping his skills sharp for both basketball and baseball.
 "We really can't do anything else," he said. "We were told to work on as much as we could at home and be ready in case we have the chance to play again. I'm thinking that we won't, but I'm hoping so."
 Pant said that Dundee's basketball team is in the same position. Many of the Vikings' athletes also play both sports.
 "I think at this point, you have to start getting ready for spring sports," Pant said. "I think they all pretty much know. Not many teams get to say they ended their season on a win, but there's a ton of them this year.
 "We're happy with the way we played Wednesday night (against Milan). If we can take a positive away, it's that. I know they're still waiting but also getting ready for spring. Overall, it's the feeling that winter sports are probably done."

One briefing, however, remains stubbornly behind closed doors. _When will Number 10 finally#StreamTheBriefings..?_


--DocBreak--
_Editor 's note: We endeavor to bring you the top voices on current events representing a range of perspectives. Below is a column arguing that safe injection sites can help reduce overdose deaths due to opioids and crime associated with drug abuse. You can find a counterpoint here, where the President of the Harrowgate Civic Association, Shannon Farrell, argues that safe injection sites will lead to increased drug dealing around the sites and endanger local communities._
 As I write, there have been dozens of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. That number will rise, because our bodies have no immunity to this novel coronavirus, and modern medicine so far has neither a vaccine against it nor a cure for it. But it would have to rise quite a bit to surpass the 130 deaths that occur in the United States _each day_ from opioid overdoses. Even in China, the daily death toll from coronavirus exceeded 130 for just four days, peaking at 150 deaths before declining to well below 50 per day.
 Unlike COVID-19, however, there is already both a medical solution to opioid overdoses and a service-industry innovation that prevents the transmission of infectious diseases among intravenous opioid users. The solution is to create more safe injection sites.
 Safe injection sites are clinics where police agree not to arrest drug users, and where medical professionals prevent users either from overdosing or transmitting deadly diseases. Medical staff give clients clean needles and educate them on how to avoid infections. They prevent overdoses by testing the impure drugs clients purchase on the street for fentanyl, a leading cause of overdose deaths, and other substances. If an overdose occurs, they administer the life-saving drug naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses. Safe injection sites monitor drug users in the same way hospitals monitor patients.
 Opioid mortality rates are unparalleled among drug-related deaths. Cocaine, hallucinogens, and MDMA (ecstasy) all have greater lifetime consumption rates than opioids, yet the number of opioid-related deaths is greater than the number of overdose deaths for all other illicit drugs combined. Opioids kill more than 48,000 Americans per year, accounting for 70 percent of all drug- overdose deaths. In 2017, the lifetime odds of dying from an opioid overdose had grown to the point where they surpassed the odds of dying in a motor vehicle crash.
 Overdoses, however, are only one part of this health crisis. Users often consume intravenous drugs in alleys and rundown buildings, with used needles and dirty water. Such conditions lead to transmission of HIV, hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases, and leave users vulnerable to theft, assault and rape.
 Safe injection sites _work_. Studies have found they prevent overdoses, reduce transmission of infectious diseases and increase the number of opioid users entering treatment programs, actively saving countless lives. Some safe injection sites have even reduced the risk of violence against female drug users.
 A non-profit organization in Philadelphia raised funds to build and operate the first legal safe injection site in the United States. If it yields results similar to safe injection sites in other countries, other cities could follow suit.
 Critics fear that making drug use safer would lead more people to use drugs. But the current strategy of banishing drug users to alleys is a death sentence for tens of thousands of Americans each year who take unsafe drugs in unsafe conditions. Addicts are hurting enough. Our approach should not be to make their lives worse. And while everyone wants to help free addicts from their addiction, reducing opioid-related deaths is more important than reducing opioid use.
 Simply put, there is a strong case for safe injection sites, and not only from a libertarian perspective. Allowing them would reduce violence against drug users by both the police and criminals. But they don't necessarily even need taxpayer funds. The Philly group is funding that SIS with private contributions. All the government needs to do is get out of the way.
 Taxpayers could also see offsetting savings. A Canadian study found that after one city opened a safe injection site, ambulance calls for treating overdoses in that city decreased by 67 percent. We need similar savings in the U.S. The White House's Council of Economic Advisors estimates that from 2015 to 2018, the social costs of opioid addiction--including spending on health care and the criminal justice system, plus lost productivity--totaled more than $2.5 trillion. From 2017 to 2018, opioid-involved overdoses accounted for 430,000 visits to emergency departments, inpatient care, and other hospital care settings. Annual hospital costs attributed to opioid overdoses amount to $1.94 billion. Some 80 percent of these patients are in taxpayer-financed health programs.
 The root cause of this health crisis is the War on Drugs. It ruins lives with harsh and unnecessary prison sentences. It treats addicts who need help like criminals, with predictable and tragic results.

Once Griffin Boone learned that his high school baseball season was on hold until at least April 14, one question popped into his head: “What now?”
 Should the Forest Park High School senior cherish his first three years competing for the Bruins even more since there might not be a fourth year if the coronavirus outbreak cancels the season?
 Or should he wait and see what happens before rushing to any rash conclusions?
 Boone, like other local high school seniors, faced this dilemma head on Friday after Prince William County Public Schools announced it was cancelling school and all after-school activities until April 14 because of the coronavirus’ rapid spread.
 “I’m trying to stay positive,” said Boone, who has signed with VCU for baseball. “But it’s obviously hard. It hasn’t hit me that this could be the end. It’s a rough situation.”
 Everyone from coaches to the Virginia High School League have cautioned against assuming there will be no spring high school sports season. But it was impossible to avoid the topic.
 “At this point, the entire Spring sport season has not been cancelled,” VHSL executive director Billy Haun said Saturday in a statement. “Everyone clearly understands the dedication and commitment thousands of parents, coaches and student-athletes have made preparing for this season. I am sure college and professional athletes feel the same way as their seasons have been suspended or cancelled. In two weeks, state leaders will evaluate the situation and provide direction for our schools – including the Spring sport season.”
 Although nothing is definite yet, area athletic directors are preparing for the possibility of at least cancelling the unplayed games, many of which are non-conference, between now and until school gets back since there wouldn’t be enough time to reschedule all of them. The regular season was scheduled to begin Monday.
 If school returns April 14 and teams are allowed to practice and play games, the regular-season schedule would have a month left before the start of the postseason. That would allow enough time to at least get in district games if necessary.
 District tournaments begin May 15 and run through May 22. Regionals start the week of May 26 and run through June 3. The state quarterfinals are June 9, state semifinals June 12 and state finals June 13.
 Schools will also have to factor in practice time as well. Osbourn Park activities director Keith Laine said he told his coaches to allow for at least three days of practice before playing any games.
 “That’s really the priority,” Laine said. “Ultimately this would be based on the kids’ best interest and their health.”
 Instead of playing the what-if game, Hylton head baseball coach Jason Ritenour has encouraged his players to find other ways to keep active on the assumption that the season will resume.

November 30, 1941 - February 22, 2020
 Freddie Lee (Ellington) Kelleher died February 22, 2020. She was at home and peaceful, surrounded by loved ones.
 Freddie was born on November 30, 1941 in Atlanta, Georgia, to Cody Ellington and Mildred Martin. When Freddie was 13 they moved to Lake Oswego, Oregon where she attended Lake Oswego public schools & proceeded to meet the boy she would eventually spend the rest of her life with, Don Kelleher.
 Don & Freddie were married in Lake Oswego, OR in 1960 and had four children. By 1971 they were ready for some changes. They decided to raise their family in a fresh, small town environment.
 The family moved to Bend, Oregon (population 12,000) in 1971, settled in to a new home and new business in the (then) Wagner Mall opening Mario’s which soon became known as Don’s Menswear. Freddie was always in the back of the store doing books or alterations but also spent some time representing Estee’ Lauder Cosmetics at The Smart Shop downtown. A few years later Don & Freddie acquired the Family Shoe Tree and started an annual holiday-season kiosk in the mall selling gift boxes offering local Grandpa Don’s meats and Oregon cheeses. Many long-term relationships were born of all those years in the Wagner Mall.
 1981 brought changes to the local economy and Freddie changed career paths. She joined Coldwell Banker Morris Real Estate where she worked as a licensee Realtor for the next thirty years. She also became a grandparent that year, which became a joy she experienced seven more times.
 Don & Freddie were active with Greater Bend Rotary, Bend Chamber of Commerce and Bend Golf & Country Club. Freddie also volunteered with National Assistance League. Running businesses and raising a family, there was never a dull moment.
 But even with life as full as it was it was not uncommon at the end of the day to fi nd clients and friends, new and old around their family dinner table, as Freddie possessed the rare talent of being able to make a big, unplanned meal from whatever was in the fridge at any given moment.
 Freddie was passionate about making travel plans, gardening, southern cooking and stopping at every fresh fruit stand life put in her path. She enjoyed thirty years of friendship with the same group of bunko buddies who will surely feel her loss every July as it was her favorite month to host.
 For good reason, Freddie was most proud of her family. Through thick and thin, all four children and their families showed up for holiday after chaotic holiday, and raucous Sunday dinners that you could count on like clockwork. Last May, they all (4 generations of Kellehers) traveled together to the British Virgin Islands to celebrate not only a beautiful wedding, but what they knew would be one “last hurrah” as a whole, very tight family unit.
 Freddie is survived by Don, husband of 59 years, brother RG Ellington (Sun City, AZ) her children Kimberly, Darrin, Bret & Shannon, grandchildren Samuel Swan, Erika Varcak, Tyler Swan, Kameron Kelleher, Makayla Hunt, Parker Hunt, Ascha Kelleher and Avery Kelleher as well as great-grandchildren, Eisley and Bohden Varcak.
 The family expresses appreciation to St. Charles Medical Center, Bend Memorial Clinic, Pilot Butte Rehab and to Partners in Care; all the many physicians and professionals who participated in her care since 2013.
 Freddie requested there would be no services. In lieu of fl owers please consider a donation to Partners in Care.

The Red Cross is urging healthy people to donate blood and platelets to prevent a shortage of supplies amid growing concerns about the Covid-19 coronavirus spreading.
 Red Cross spokeswoman Kelly Isenor said the blood and platelet supplies are somewhat lower at this time of the year across the region because seasonal flu tends to discourage people from donating.
 "Right now, we are doing what we can to prevent a shortage," she said. "With people talking about the coronavirus, and being worried about it, we want to get the word out that donating blood is a safe process. It does not have any effect on the immune system. There is no evidence that this coronavirus or any respiratory virus is transmitted through blood transfusions."
 Red Cross Blood Services President Chris Hrouda said it is critical to have a readily available blood supply for hospital patients, despite the challenges posed by Covid-19.
 "As fears of coronavirus rise, low donor participation could harm blood availability at hospitals, and the last thing a patient should worry about is whether lifesaving blood will be on the shelf when they need it most," he said in a written statement.
 Isenor said the Red Cross staff at blood donation facilities and temporary collection sites had implemented extra precautions to protect donors from contracting Covid-19.
 "All of our Red Cross staff is trained in safety protocols," she said. "They include wearing gloves and they routinely wipe down surfaces touched by donors. The staff uses sterile collection sets for each donation, and the sets are discarded immediately after use. At blood drives and donations centers, we are doing more disinfecting. The staff is changing their gloves following each donation made by a donor."
 Isenor said the additional precautions by the Red Cross staff involve a" robust health screening process," of blood donors.
 "The process involves checking a donor's hemoglobin level," she said. "It is a substance that carries iron in your bloodstream. There are a lot of health history questions that are asked of donors. We also check a donor's body temperature and blood pressure."
 The staff also asks donors if they have recently traveled to China, Macau, Hong Kong, South Korea, Iran, and Italy because Covid-19 has severely impacted these nations.
 "We ask people who have traveled to those areas to wait 28 days before they donate blood," she said. "That 28 days would start from the time they return."
 Isenor said the Red Cross requests would-be donors who have been in contact with anybody who has Covid-19 to wait 28 days before donating blood or platelets.
 A Red Cross summary states, the agency is evaluating all emerging risks posed by Covid-19 and is working with the Centers for Disease Control in addition to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to determine if additional intervention strategies are needed.
 Hrouda said it's important for people to continue donating blood because patients need it.
 "Keep giving, keep hosting blood drives," he said.

When young adults are in the process of entering the workforce after college, they often take jobs that will pay the bills and will build their resume. The last thing on their minds is the 401(k) plan because they think they will have more time once their careers have been established. Taking this approach could be beneficial to make them better candidates for more opportunities in the future, but it won’t help them save for retirement.
