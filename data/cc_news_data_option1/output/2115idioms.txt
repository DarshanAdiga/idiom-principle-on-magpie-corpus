PLYMOUTH - Plymouth North Baseball Head Coach Dwayne Follette and this week's 50-for-50 profile Joe Flynn have something in common.
 Flynn always wanted the baseball in the most important games. And when those games came up on the schedule Follette always wanted the baseball in the hands of the big right-handed pitcher.
 "Joey's the best pitcher I've ever seen throw the ball for Plymouth," Follette said. "I've been lucky to have some really good pitchers over the years but in my mind Joe is the best out of all of them. He threw the ball in the high 80's but he had this amazing pinpoint control. He could put the baseball anywhere he wanted to around the plate and he had several pitches that he had the confidence to throw at any time in the count.
 "Joe was a very good athlete but the thing that really set him apart from the pack was his competitive nature. He is such a great gentleman off of the field, but when he got between the baselines he was an intense competitor."
 "I'm still that way," admitted Flynn, 29, who is a firefighter in town. "The competition aspect of the game is the thing that I always loved about playing sports and it's also what I miss the most now that I'm not playing any longer.
 "The bigger the game, the more I liked it and nobody had more fun playing high school sports than I did," Flynn added. "Sports were a huge part of my day back then. A lot of my teammates were my best friends and I'm still close with so many of them to this day. We shared a lot of great times together."
 An outstanding relief appearance in a come-from-behind playoff win over Dighton-Rehoboth as a freshman was just a taste of what was to come for Flynn. He was 33-4 as a starter over his final three years with the Eagles, twice winning the Atlantic Coast League and Division 2 Player of the Year honors while leading Plymouth North to the Div. 2 state title game against Auburn at the end of his junior and senior years.
 He was also a solid defender at third base when not on the mound as well as a very good hitter, slugging six homers and driving in 28 teammates as a senior.
 "He was unbelievably consistent on the mound. Whenever I gave the baseball to Joe I was sure that we were going to win that game," Follette said. "He threw a couple of no-hitters and had a 9-1 record in playoff games in high school. I can only remember him having one bad start in all the time that he played for me."
 Flynn thought his team was meant for big things during his sophomore year in 2007 but the Blue Eagles were upset by Foxboro in extra innings in the second round of the Div. 2 playoffs.
 Plymouth North finally put it all together in 2008, running the table for a 26-0 record and a Div. 2 state championship when they beat Auburn 1-0 in 10 innings.
 They ended the season ranked seventh in the USA TODAY national high school baseball poll.
 "That year was magic," said Joe, who had four of his team's six wins during the tournament run and was an unblemished 12-0 over the entire season. "It was special. There were games where things could have gone off the rails but every time we needed it somebody different stepped up and made a play to keep the winning streak going."
 Wins were harder to come by in 2009 when the Eagles snuck into the playoffs with a record of 11-9. Despite being the 20th seed in the bracket they got hot at the exact right time and ran off five straight upset wins to get to a state title re-match with Auburn that they lost 2-1.
 "Auburn scored two unearned runs in the first inning and then Joe shut them down the rest of the game," Follette said. "Unfortunately we couldn't get anything going offensively against their pitcher."
 The next step up the baseball ladder for Flynn was time with the Franklin Pierce baseball program and two summers playing in the Cape Cod Baseball League as a member of the Wareham Gatemen where he was a teammate of Boston Red Sox reliever Matt Barnes, Houston Astros All-Star outfielder George Springer and Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Max Muncey.
 "It was a big jump from high school baseball to Franklin Pierce, which is one of the top NCAA Division II programs in the entire country," Joe said. "You were competing against some top baseball talent every game and your training had to be year-round to keep up with everyone else. You had to give it a full commitment or you were going to fall by the wayside."
 Franklin Pierce made it to the NCAA tournament all five of the years Flynn pitched with the Ravens, including two trips to the Div. II national playoff finals.
 Flynn was off to a great start to his junior year (4-0 with a 1.40 earned run average) and was getting some draft buzz from MLB teams before things came to a screeching halt. Discomfort in his pitching elbow led to season-ending Tommy John Surgery.
 "I remember just not feeling right and Matt (Franklin Pierce starting catcher and former Plymouth North teammate Matt Walsh) noticed that my pitches were a little off," Flynn remembered. "I decided to get it looked at and that's when we found some pretty significant damage in the elbow that had to be taken care of."
 Flynn made it back to the mound by the end of the 2013 season and picked up five saves in 10 innings of relief action. He closed out his senior season back again as a starter with a record of 5-3.
 With all his baseball accomplishments at Plymouth North you might forget that Flynn was also a very good football player. A two-way starter at quarterback and safety, Flynn led the Blue Eagles to a winning record in both his junior and senior years.
 "There was no better adrenaline rush than walking down that hill at the old Romano Stadium to get to the football field," Flynn said. "It had that 'Friday Night Lights' feel to it with the big crowds cheering the team on. I loved playing football and it was tough giving it up to concentrate on baseball in college."
 Former Blue Eagle Head Football Coach Bill Burkhead praised Flynn for both his athleticism as well as his competitive nature.
 "Joe had a passion for the game. He was a gifted athlete who could run with the football and he had a cannon for an arm," said Burkhead. "We were traditionally a running football team but we switched things up when Joe came around. He was a talented passer and he had a couple good targets in Keegan Grabhorn and Tom MacInnes."
 Flynn still lives in town with his wife, Noelle. He was inducted into the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame in 2015.

Floyd, who is black, died Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes. Floyd's death has shaken the Minneapolis community and sparked protests in cities across the United States. Chauvin was arrested Friday afternoon and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, local authorities announced.
 Saturday's announcement marks the second such known donation by the 49ers organization in the past four years to social justice causes. In September 2016, the Niners matched the $1 million donation made by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to Bay Area charities -- the Silicon Valley Community Foundation and the San Francisco Foundation -- that addressed social issues in collaboration with law enforcement.
 Kaepernick spent the 2016 season protesting police brutality and systemic oppression of minorities in the country by kneeling during the national anthem before games. In addition to the protest, Kaepernick donated the first $1 million he earned that season to a variety of social justice charities across the country. He also donated proceeds from his jersey sales to similar causes.
 York's statement and donation made him the latest member of the NFL world to speak out after Floyd's death. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell also released a statement on Saturday after many players and coaches around the league did the same.

 The newspaper poses a question to the group each week, and participants choose whether to comment. This column is designed to bring the voices of well- informed residents into the Forum page to address issues, one at a time.
 Participants cross the local political spectrum and live throughout the town. Some are current or past Town Meeting representatives, and all are active in the community. We hope their diverse points of view will encourage discussion of the issues Plymouth faces.
 This week's question  
 Destination Plymouth's executive director sees a dire picture for Plymouth and the county in terms of a significant loss of tourism dollars this year and in coming years. Unless, possibly, assistance in the form of promotion funding aid comes to bear. What do you think of local tourism as an economic engine, and what impact will the coronavirus pandemic situation have on it?
 Pat Adelmann
 Lea Filson, the executive director of Destination Plymouth, was doing a good job of promoting Plymouth as a tourist haven, before the Coronavirus pandemic. No doubt she will continue and succeed to bring tourists to Plymouth when all the restrictions are lifted. On a flight to Buffalo in January, I saw multiple life-size murals in the airports, enticing travelers to experience the many offerings in Plymouth.
 The rebound will be long and tough but Plymouth is too beautiful to miss. Tourists will be back. Perhaps some of the Cares Act's $90,000,000 awarded to the County can be dispersed to help Plymouth's tourism.
 Pat Adelmann has been a Plymouth resident since 1977 and is a mother of five Plymouth Public School graduates, a proud grandmother of 12, a former School Committee member and a former Town Meeting representative.
 Ed Angley
 The virus shutdown is and will continue to be a disaster for the tourist industry in Plymouth. People will be reluctant to travel, particularly people from overseas. Plimoth Plantation is, to some extent, an outdoor venue, but derives significant revenue from retail sales and school trips. School trips are gone. I think people will be reluctant to congregate in the retail shops at the Plantation. As pointed out by Lea Filson in the news paper, tourists are a great driver of the local economy in terms of hotels, restaurants, retail shops, etc. I can imagine that people will be reluctant to travel great distances. So, an economic disaster.

 Jay Beauregard
 A town or city should not base its income on tourism. If you are a business owner that caters to tourists you "may" be ok on a regular yearly basis. However, the economy follows cycles. It goes up, falls and corrects itself and then starts over. When something like this virus happens it only gets worse on the down side. If you are a regular working Joe you do not support your family on the pay that a tourist trap or retail will pay you.
 No promotional funding aid. If individual or groups of businesses want to pool their money and place their own advertising then that is fine. But any sort of aid or bailout only means that someone somewhere else has to pay for it. Or we can kick the can down the road, borrow lots of money and our grandchildren will have to pay for our greed. Which is currently what our state and federal governments are currently doing.
 We have an industrial park. Guess we should have allowed more industry in there instead of pretty office space.
 Open up the economy. Try to minimize the damage as much as possible. Make Massachusetts a free state again.

 Karen Buechs
 Watching the news across the country this past holiday weekend one would never know there was a pandemic going on. Looks like you can't hold people down for too long. Tourism is so important to our town. It is an economic engine that must be encouraged. I suspect people will continue to visit all throughout this year.

 Mike Landers
 Tourism is the largest resource that we have in Plymouth. It brings millions into the community. Be it the Arts, History, Dining, Retail Shops, Special Events, Recreation etc., we all benefit in some way or another. The loss of revenue has been immediate to restaurants, bars, historical facilities, concert and arts venues, retail shops, etc., not to mention those who have lost their livelihood. (My company, Nightlife Music Co. has not had a cent of income since February).
 The recovery will be equally challenging. With the loss of marketing and events dollars in 2021, we will need to resort to collaborative marketing with our Tourism partners, massive free Social Marketing, an uptick in generous sponsorships, etc. to speed our recovery. I hope that in the next recovery stimulus package, Tourism and supporting businesses, non-profits, workers in those industries and others will not be forgotten. Our non-profit, Project Arts of Plymouth, Inc. are planning our FREE Summer Concert Series to be larger than ever for 2021, because obviously, the key to our recovery is a resurgence of tourists and locals coming out to support us and all other businesses in Plymouth in 2021. We can all do this together.

 David Peck
 Covid19 has knocked tourism to a complete standstill. The key question, of course, will be the pace of the rebound, the recovery. On that, I am optimistic, as there is a growing pent-up need to travel and get out from under house arrest. And those future tourists will be uneasy about getting on an airplane, so they will more likely be picking destinations to which they can drive with their families. Plymouth is a relatively easy drive from anywhere in the Northeast, including New York and New Jersey. I predict a regional rebound while we wait for the slower return of national and international visitors. And we are the Cape without the bridges: fine beaches of salt and fresh water, great restaurants, lively outdoor brew pubs, fishing and whale watching excursions, vast hiking and bicycling recreation, not to mention 400 years of history. Getting help for promotion and marketing would be a great accelerator, reminding our future visitors that we are close to home, we are open, and we are a great destination, year round.

 Letter showed zero knowledge of racing
 As a race fan, I can answer Ellenor Shepherd’s letter to the editor about Ace Speedway and racing fans (May 26).
 I started going to racetracks in the 1970s. I spent more than 10 years working on a race team and 10 years as a NASCAR official. Ms. Shepherd’s knowledge of race fans is zero. I have never met a race fan who does not obey a police officer’s orders.
 Robert and Jason Turner have spent countless time and money to make Ace Speedway a great racing facility. They have every right to open the speedway for racing. The Turners did not force anybody to come to the track. You have the choice to not attend.
 She further decides to attack race fans by questioning what hope their children have for a safe, sane and happy life. I know race fans who are doctors and lawyers and own successful companies. Their children have grown and continue to grow with safe, sane and happy lives.
 She also felt the need to add politics to her letter. I know Democrat, Republican and independent race fans.
 I can only hope she gives more thought to her vote for our next president than her letter.

 County commissioners shortchange schools
 Our county commissioners have made a critical decision that affects all of us.
 Instead of allowing voters to decide on much-needed, long-term investments in our public schools, they tied the hands of the community and future boards by setting a $300 million bond ceiling — a fraction of what is needed.
 The true need exceeds $2 billion, according to an independent study. The Board of Education requested a $1.6 billion bond initiative, which had wide support from business and community leaders across political lines.
 Yet the commissioners opted, once again, to kick the can down the road. As a result, our children across the district will continue to wait for safe and suitable classrooms. And our community will have to wait for the post-COVID-19 economic boost infrastructure spending could bring.
 To be clear, we must be smart about how we invest our county’s hard-earned tax dollars. There is a direct correlation between public education and economic prosperity and the health of a community.
 We need leaders with vision — who see the urgency of our situation. If our public schools fail, we all fail.

But his most important audience remains Max, who as a third-grader, has become slightly more low-key about the notes.

 But while Max’s enthusiasm for the notes may be a bit more reserved these days, he shows the effect they have on his life in other ways, namely by creating his own art.
 Firesheets says his son has become interested in drawing, himself, in recent years.
 “I love that he does these really amazing storyboards and drawings that accompany them,” he says. “In the beginning, he just did the drawings, and now he adds the words. It’s a great way for kids to express themselves and tell about their life at home and what they think about and read about.”

 “The whole thing just comes out of love for him,” he says. “He’s growing up and becoming a little man with a little man’s attitude. And it’s like with any family, nothing’s perfect, but you love your kids, and you just want to give them what you can. And art is the thing I feel I can give to my family.”
