The overall plan is to also have a few little mini scale ships to accompany the model - a few TIE fighters, bombers and Darth Vader's infamous advanced variant, as well as some rebel ships. Trouble is, some of the MOC mini scale ships use rare components, so can't be built at the moment. The funny thing is that if everything were done to scale, a TIE fighter would be half a stud, an X-Wing a whole stud and the Millennium Falcon three studs. I'd love to get a Trench Run or Hoth diorama in too.

Miranda Parnell says a person wearing a MAGA hat showed up at the rally, protesters confronted that person. Rocks were then thrown and one of them hit Parnell.Parnell was taken from the scene to an area hospital and is okay.Earlier, a journalist in Minneapolis was shot in the thigh by a rubber bullet. Demonstrators also broke windows and vandalized the Atlanta office building where CNN is headquartered, and police in Louisville, Kentucky, apologized after an officer fired what appeared to be pepper bullets at a television news crew with WAVE, also owned by Gray Television.Fox's Leland Vittert was rattled following the Washington attack that he said was clearly targeted at his news organization.“We took a good thumping,” he told The Associated Press. A live shot he was doing was interrupted by a group of protesters who shouted obscenities directed at Fox. Flanked by two security guards, he and photographer Christian Galdabini walked away from Washington's Lafayette Park trailed by an angry group before riot police dispersed them.Vittert said there were no markings on him or the crew's equipment to identify them as from Fox. But he said during the demonstration, one man continually asked him who he worked for. He didn't answer, but the man found a picture of Vittert on his cell phone and shouted to other protesters that he was from Fox.“The protesters stopped protesting whatever it was they were protesting and turned on us,” he said, “and that was a very different feeling.”He compared it to when he was chased away from a demonstration in Egypt during the Arab Spring of 2011 by a group that shouted, “Fox News hates Muslims.”A correspondent from the website The Daily Caller followed Vittert and the demonstrators as they left the park. At one point, someone took Vittert's microphone and threw it at his back. One woman chasing him wore a t-shirt that said, “I can’t breathe,” a reference what Floyd said earlier this week when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck.Vittert said he was “extremely grateful” to the Daily Caller for documenting the scene; Galdabini’s camera was smashed. “They were putting themselves at risk,” he said.“It makes me proud to do my job and to be a journalist,” he said. “I'm proud to be an organization that is unyielding in our coverage. We're going to keep on telling our story and doing exactly what we're doing.”Suzanne Scott, CEO of Fox News Media, said in a memo on Saturday that Fox was taking all necessary security precautions to protect its journalists covering the story.“We are truly living in unprecedented and transformative times and freedom of the press is a vital element to the foundation of our society,” Scott wrote.On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his two-person crew were arrested while covering overnight protests in Minneapolis. They were quickly released, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized to CNN.CNN's headquarters in Atlanta was targeted later Friday by a group of protesters who also fought with police and set cars afire. While police tried to keep them away from the CNN Center, demonstrators broke windows there and scrawled obscene graffiti on the network's logo.In Louisville, WAVE-TV was on the air covering a demonstration when video showed a police officer aiming a rifle at reporter Kaitlin Rust and her crew. She was heard yelling, “I’ve been shot! I’ve been shot!” and described them as pepper bullets.Louisville Police spokeswoman Jesse Halladay apologized for the incident, and said police would review the video for potential discipline.Demonstrators surrounded the police department headquarters in Columbia, S.C. on Saturday and a scuffle broke out with someone wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat.

Concern for employees’ financial and physical well-being are part of the planning process, executives say.
 Netflix in March announced creation of a $100 million fund to help entertainment workers affected by the pandemic, while networks and studios are trying to determine the best way to restart productions safely.
 “One big thing we’re working on now is to figure out, what is the protocol to get things back up and going? How can we do that with a real assurance of safety?” says Kevin Reilly, president of cablenetworks TBS, TNT and TruTV, and chief content officer for upcoming streaming service HBO Max.
 With production halted, broadcast networks, which have nightly primetime schedules to fill, have been holding back shows with fully produced seasons to provide new programming for the next few months.
 Fox, for example, delayed the spring premieres of “Filthy Rich” and “Next” to make them cornerstones of a fall lineup.
 Networks also are acquiring shows that have aired internationally or on streaming services to beef up original programming options. CW picked up “Tell Me a Story” from CBS All Access, a corporate cousin, while Fox will offer “L.A.’s Finest,” a “Bad Boys” spinoff previously available only to Spectrum cable subscribers.
 Improvisation will likely play a role going forward, following the examples of programs that found ways to finish new episodes after filming stopped. CBS’ “All Rise” ingeniously fashioned a season finale by framing the episode as a trial via videoconference with cast members performing from home, while NBC’s “The Blacklist” filled in an episode’s unfilmed scenes with graphic-novel- style animation.
 Experimentation goes on behind the scenes, too. Sarandos applauded a virtual table read for Netflix’s “Big Mouth,” as cast read an episodic script remotely via online connection rather than together in the same room.
 Streaming services, which have enjoyed a bump in viewership with so many people stuck at home, have relied on libraries of original series and past hits. However, the pandemic may not be the best time to launch a new service, as short-form programming service Quibi hasn’t fared well since starting in April, although some of its problems may not be related to COVID-19.
 Whether the pandemic is boon or curse for a new service may become clearer with HBO Max, the new Warner Bros. streaming service that had planned to go forward with its May 27 launch. It’s had to adjust, too, as the taping of a much-awaited “Friends” cast reunion, designed to draw subscribers at kickoff, had to be postponed because of stay-at-home restrictions.

In addition, Canada saw 425,475 travellers arrive at our international airports, including 123,694 arriving from the United States and 301,781 travellers coming from overseas.
 Of those arriving via air, 275,485 were citizens and 20,218 held permanent residency status.
 That leaves a jaw-dropping 129,772 non-Canadian travellers who were able to fly into Canada while our borders were supposed to be closed.
 Nearly one in three travellers seem to fall outside the guidelines about who can enter Canada at this time.
 I reached out to the CBSA to ask the obvious questions: Who are these 130,000 travellers and why were they allowed into Canada if our borders are closed to non-citizens or permanent residents?
 The CBSA promptly replied to my email, letting me know that they simply don't track this information.
 "The statistics you have requested are not available. As you can imagine, compiling stats is a very time consuming process and requires resources that are not readily available at this busy time," wrote a CBSA spokesperson.
 Busy time? Airport travel into Canada is down 98% from this time last year.
 This is perhaps the least busy the CBSA has ever been. And besides, if they can tally the number of citizens and permanent residents entering Canada, why can't they track the other visas being used to gain entry?
 This seems like an odd lack of transparency from Canada's border agency.
 Fortunately, within the boiler-point information at the bottom of the CBSA's email, I was given a clue about these 130,000 mysterious travellers.
 "The CBSA enforces Orders in Council (OICs) in place during the pandemic. Under Order in Council 7… foreign nationals are currently prohibited from entering Canada… with some exceptions, including temporary foreign workers and international students."
 There you have it. The 130,000 travellers must be either temporary foreign workers (TFWs) or international students.
 But Canadians deserve to know why these exemptions were put in place.
 Canada's economy lost nearly two million jobs last month, and the unemployment rate is 18% when adjusted to include those whose job loss is temporary. More than 7 million Canadians have applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. So why on earth are we still admitting TFWs?
 The rationale behind the program is that Canada has significant labour shortages and employers can't find enough workers to fill open positions. This program has always been suspect, but it's particularly dubious at a time when our economy is collapsing and millions are out of work.
 As for international students, Canada's colleges and universities are closed. They've moved exclusively to online models and some have already announced that Fall classes will be held primarily online.
 Rather than enforcing the border closure, the Trudeau government quietly made exemptions for visa categories that frankly make no sense during this pandemic.
 To add insult to injury, Trudeau is also extending the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to both international students and TFWs. This will cost taxpayers up to $8 billion.
 No wonder officials tell Canadians this information is "not readily available."
 It's a lot easier than having to defend this regrettable policy.

"The ambiguity comes around the word 'booked.' So does 'booked' refer to the act of taking the reservation or the occupancy period?"
 White said there have been very few people arguing their rental agreement is still valid because it was booked before April 4. For the most part, guests and owners have been very understanding of the situation, he added.
 The Ontario Cottage Rental Manager's Association, a group of nine organizations of which CottageLINK is a member, drafted a letter to the province outlining their thoughts and recommendations on how to open up rentals in a safe and responsible manner.
 "Things like enhanced cleaning processes is front and centre," White said. "We're looking at increased changeover windows so that cleaners and caretakers have the additional time to go through a disinfection routine to make sure that guests coming into a property can be confident that it's been properly cleaned and disinfected."
 But if you own a second property located in cottage country, there is no specific law forbidding your visit as long as you have enough food and other necessities for the duration of your stay and you remain isolated at the property.
 Terry Rees, Executive Director of the Federation of Ontario Cottagers’ Association, says he has echoed the advice health officials and the provincial government have issued at the onset of the pandemic, although it was hard to take for cottage owners eager to use their property.
 "It's a long winter," said Rees, who is based in Peterborough. "A lot of people have a lot of money and interest tied up in the rural community. There's a lot of angst about that, but I think most people did their part and understood that we're in emergency times and we had to do what we needed to do."
 Rees understands the concerns from rural mayors and year-round residents that people from larger urban centres may bring the virus to their community.
 But businesses in cottage country also have to balance the needs of the local economy, which has struggled since the initial lockdown with the stampede of vacationers reduced to a trickle.
 "We're all trying to work through this together and understanding it's unprecedented times," Rees said.
