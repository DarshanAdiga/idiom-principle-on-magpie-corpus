After a decade in Asia, this peripatetic British former fashion designer and her husband, Ronan, a financier, had planned to settle their family into their home in the leafy Boston suburb of Concord. “I was convinced we’d move into a traditional New England clapboard or saltbox,” says McCullough. But no, they fell for a 1940s stucco that looks as if it had been plucked straight from Kent. It was “the most English house in the area,” as McCullough calls it, and seemed especially so during the viewing, when the two open fireplaces were roaring—catnip for a Brit, she claims. “Plus, there was a vintage Bordeaux Jag in the driveway... They really put it on for us!” But for the time being, the family hauled all that crated furniture out to the property’s stables. Mold tests came back positive: The family’s own picturesque moment would have to wait.

United Airlines' Embraer E175 aircraft are heading to the maintenance hangar for a retrofit that will actually reduce their total number of seats.
 The largest regional jets operated under the United Express brand will purposely be made less economical to fly thanks to what's known as a "scope clause" in United's pilot contract, FlightGlobal reported. The six-seat reduction from 76 to 70 seats on all of its Embraer E175s is mandatory per the contract as United plans to furlough pilots - which triggers the seat removal, United told AviationWeek - after assistance under the CARES Act vanishes on October 1.
 Though it seems counterintuitive to make a plane less capable of generating revenue during the pandemic - considering United has committed to filling its planes to capacity - the move is actually protecting United's pilots. As part of a deal with the pilot union, United can have 255 regional jets that seat greater than 50 and no more than 76 seats, according to FlightGlobal.
 The reduction in demand that the pandemic has inflicted would have made regional jets more attractive to fly since they carry fewer passengers further at a lower cost than mainline jets. But having those scope limitations in place is preventing United from outsourcing its mainline operation to the regional partners.

Southend have appointed former Weymouth boss Mark Molesley as their new manager, replacing Sol Campbell who left by mutual consent in June.
 The ex-Bournemouth and Aldershot midfielder, 39, enjoyed great success at Weymouth and guided them into the National League on the back of successive promotions during his three seasons with the Dorset-based club.
 Molesley, who during his time as Terras manager also helped coach Bournemouth’s U23 side, is looking forward to working at Southend, who were relegated to Sky Bet League Two this summer. He will be joined at Roots Hall by coach Tom Prodomo.
 Molesley said: “It’s a really exciting time for me and my assistant manager coming in. It’s a great day for us but it’s also a little bittersweet because I’m leaving two fantastic clubs as well, in Bournemouth and Weymouth.
 “But we’re really excited by this challenge at this great football club so I’m proud to be standing here and excited by the challenge.
 “After speaking with the chairman I can see he shares the same vision and work ethic to take this club onwards and upwards.

 "There was a saying among the Taliban leadership that got back to us," Fitzgerald said. "They would say, 'Fight the Americans. Fight the infidels. Fight them hard, but if you ever see the tiny gray helicopters, don't shoot them. They will kill you.'"

But the state has an unexpected starring role in the presidential race as the coronavirus keeps presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden away from traditional campaigning and close to home in his bid to unseat President Donald Trump in November.


--DocBreak--
WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Delaware isn't a swing state. It has three electoral votes. Driving its entire length, from Pennsylvania to Maryland, takes only a little more than an hour and a half.
 But the state has an unexpected starring role in the presidential race as the coronavirus keeps presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden away from traditional campaigning and close to home in his bid to unseat President Donald Trump in November.
 Biden announced California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate this past week in Wilmington and they made their public debut at the suburban high school where Biden votes. The campaign then operated for three days from the opulent Hotel DuPont downtown, where Biden had announced his first run for Senate, for the 1972 race. In a ballroom converted to a makeshift web studio, Biden and Harris held video conferences with health and economic advisers and signed documents to formally become the Democratic presidential ticket.
 “We’ve never had a campaign like this, where essentially he’s probably going to be campaigning from Wilmington because of COVID-19,” said John Flaherty, a Delaware open-government advocate who worked as a staff assistant for Biden in his Senate office in Wilmington from 1978 to 1995. “It’s going to be a learning curve for all of us as to how you campaign for national office and you can’t be close to people.”
 There has never been an American president from Delaware, though Rutherford B. Hayes was born in Delaware, Ohio.
 The spotlight on Delaware could be even brighter if Biden is elected. In addition to his Wilmington home, his family has a beach house in Rehoboth Beach, which could become a summer retreat on par with George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas or Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

 However, with the new season just weeks away and a truncated summer transfer window already open, head coach Steve Bruce and his players remain in limbo on and off the pitch.

Motherwell once failed to tempt a schoolboy Stephen O’Donnell with a signing pitch that included strawberry tarts, but the Scotland international has now rejected several clubs in England to finally join his local team.
 The full-back, who hails from neighbouring Wishaw, has signed until January after Stephen Robinson suffered several injury blows.
 The 28-year-old former Luton player had declared unfinished business in England when he rejected a new Kilmarnock contract but he has ended up far closer to home.
 O’Donnell said: “I have not played for five months so I was starting to itch to get back in.
 “The club is on my doorstep, I know a lot of people involved, added into the mix you are playing in Europe, they finished third last season and they play a good, attractive brand of football, on a grass pitch, which will be a nice change.
 “I always said I had an interest in going back down south, if it was right for myself and my family. I had a couple of offers and they weren’t right. Whether it was financially, or the club, all round, it didn’t matter, it needed to be right for my family first and foremost.
 “I don’t think it could be more right than two minutes down the road. I will certainly get plenty of time to spend with my wee man.

“It’s a tricky one because player safety is very important. If you have bowlers bowling at 85mph-plus and it’s gloomy out there, it can be dangerous for batsmen,” he said.
 “The officials were right to bring us off, it had dropped below the darkness that we had come off for earlier in the day and all of our fielders were saying, ‘we wouldn’t want to bat in this, this is quite dark’.

 “There’s been occasions in Test cricket when there’s been a crowd and we thought we could have been on the pitch but it felt slightly on the dark side of being suitable to play.”
 His new-ball partner Anderson was more obviously keen to move things on but also accepted the verdict.
 “We’re a little bit frustrated we didn’t get a chance to finish them off,” he said.
 “It was gloomy but it’s one of those when it didn’t seem like the batsmen were struggling too much. I don’t know what the light reading was, maybe there could be a bit more leeway there.”
 One suggestion to extend the playing hours is for appropriately aged pink balls to be substituted in when the floodlights take over – recreating the conditions of day/night Test cricket – but a pair of bowlers with more than 1,000 wickets between them were agreed on the wisdom of that innovation.

 “I don’t think we can change the colour of the ball when it gets a bit dark, I don’t think that’s a goer really,” said Anderson.
 Broad, meanwhile, showed some rare solidarity with the men he has spent a career trying to get out.
 “We’ve seen with the history of the pink ball under lights, it’s been very tricky for the batsmen and would be unfair to the balance to the game,” he said.
 “You could lose five for 10 that’s going too far and complicating the situation. If the players’ safety is in doubt, the officials have to bring them off. If they think it’s safe, you play.”

 “We’re pleased that we are still able to showcase the pinnacle match of the ANZ Premiership during a season that has tossed up so many challenges for players, management, fans and officials.”
 This comes after the final round of regular matches was called off due to the everchanging Covid-19 situation in the country.
 The first cases of the disease were found in New Zealand this week after over 100 days of having no cases.
