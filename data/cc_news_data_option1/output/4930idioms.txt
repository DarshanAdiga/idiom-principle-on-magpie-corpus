Among the criticisms of boxing across the last quarter-century, chief among them has been an accusation that the sport struggles to create new stars.
 Of course, more than a few exceptions to that rule exist but boxing's detractors point to a continuing inability, or even unwillingness, to match the sport's biggest fighters against one another as a key reason why boxing has ceded ground to promotions such as the UFC.
 But there appears to be a new train of thought among boxing promoters; why risk the momentum of your biggest prospects by putting them in competitive fights when you can wheel out a pair of 50-something ex-fighters and a YouTuber and laugh all the way to the bank?

ROMA (ITALPRESS) – La seconda ondata di pandemia sta colpendo molte famiglie e parte del tessuto imprenditoriale. In questo contesto difficile Reale Mutua promuove, in partnership con Lavazza e Fondazione Vodafone e in collaborazione con la Fondazione La Stampa Specchio dei tempi, l’iniziativa “A Cena con la Solidarietà”. Un progetto rivolto a mille famiglie in grave difficoltà, residenti nelle città di Torino (quattrocento), Milano (quattrocento) e Udine (duecento), con un impatto importante anche sulla filiera della ristorazione locale.   I nuclei familiari sono stati identificati grazie all’analisi di Fondazione Specchio dei Tempi- La Stampa ed è stata data priorità alle famiglie con un maggior numero di componenti e con una situazione economica di particolare indigenza.   A loro saranno offerte tre cene a settimana, per cinque settimane, cucinate, confezionate e consegnate a domicilio dagli esercizi di ristorazione che hanno aderito all’iniziativa in ciascuna delle tre città coinvolte.   I ristoranti che partecipano al progetto sono già attivi sul fronte della sostenibilità con attività dedicate all’inclusione socio-economica delle categorie più fragili, alla valorizzazione delle diversità, alla formazione di giovani in situazioni difficili. “Tutti hanno aderito con grande entusiasmo a questa iniziativa mettendo a disposizione la loro professionalità e competenza per offrire una varietà di pasti nel rispetto delle varie esigenze alimentari – si legge in una nota -. Un’iniziativa che permetterà loro di dare continuità all’attività di ristorazione distribuendo oltre 500 cene a settimana, per tutto il mese di dicembre”.   “Insieme siamo più forti. Un concetto integrato nel principio di mutualità, che la pandemia ha riaffermato e che non dimentichiamo perchè è la base di qualsiasi strategia di sviluppo sostenibile e inclusivo – afferma Luca Filippone, direttore generale di Reale Mutua -. Con Lavazza, Fondazione Vodafone, Specchio dei Tempi e tutti i ristoranti che ci sostengono, facciamo la nostra parte, convinti che anche questo debba essere il nostro ruolo nel sistema Paese”.   “Siamo particolarmente orgogliosi di far parte di questo progetto, che mira a supportare non solo le fasce più fragili della popolazione, ma anche a sostenere la filiera della ristorazione, tra le più colpite dagli effetti dell’emergenza sanitaria. Uno dei nostri valori fondamentali, infatti, è il senso di responsabilità nei confronti di tutte le comunità in cui operiamo, nel nostro territorio come nei Paesi produttori di caffè – spiega Marco Lavazza, vicepresidente del Gruppo Lavazza -. Lo facciamo da sempre nel pieno spirito di collaborazione, con partner di valore – come Reale Mutua – e in coerenza con il Goal 17 degli SDGs – ‘Partnership per gli Obiettivì dell’Agenda 2030 delle Nazioni Unite”.   “Continua il nostro impegno per sostenere le persone colpite dalle conseguenze sanitarie ed economiche della pandemia – ha affermato Marinella Soldi, presidente di Fondazione Vodafone Italia -. La sinergia con Reale Mutua, Lavazza e con la Fondazione La Stampa Specchio dei tempi ha permesso di dare sostegno concreto a diverse famiglie che si trovano in condizioni di emergenza alimentare, una risposta importante in un momento in cui le fragilità vengono ulteriormente intensificate dalla pandemia”.   “Dare un aiuto subito a chi ha bisogno: questa è la mission di Specchio dei tempi. La grave crisi sanitaria ed economica ha duramente colpito le famiglie più indigenti. Siamo felici di poter mettere a disposizione la nostra esperienza a sostegno di questo progetto a Torino, Milano e Udine. La collaborazione ormai pluriennale con Reale Mutua è un’opportunità per essere ancora più vicini a chi ha necessità”, spiega Lodovico Passerin d’Entrèves, presidente di Fondazione La Stampa – Specchio dei tempi.

As a new wave of coronavirus infections sweeps Tokyo, a pop-up store near Japan's capital is luring Christmas shoppers with 250 types of face mask, including festive versions with decorative lights. Tokyo Mask Land, which opened Tuesday for a month in an office building in Yokohama, also has a mask bar and is offering mask-making workshops to draw visitors. REUTERSA woman tries to take selfie photos in front of a photo spot featuring Christmas season scene and masks at Tokyo Mask Land, a face-mask theme exhibition and its speciality shop, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Yokohama, Japan.People often wore face mask in Japan before the pandemic, particularly during the winter flu season and in Spring when cedar and cypress pollen triggers hay fever.Although no law mandates wearing them, it is unusual to see someone without a mask in Tokyo, even outside. The store also plans an exhibit on the history of face coverings and a photo booth featuring Christmas trees and a mannequin dressed up as Santa Claus.REUTERSFace masks are displayed at Tokyo Mask Land, a face-mask theme exhibition and its speciality shop, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Yokohama, Japan."I don't think you would come up with an idea like this if there had been no coronavirus outbreak," 23-year-old Ryota Nabetani, who was shopping for masks with his mother, said of the photo spot.Although it has had far fewer cases than in the United States and Europe, a recent surge in coronavirus infections prompted authorities in Tokyo last week to request bars and restaurants to shorten opening hours.Japan's capital on Tuesday reported 372 new cases, the seventh straight day above 300, according to public broadcaster NHK.

Mark Hubbard made his major championship debut at Harding Park, and he made the cut in the PGA Championship in part because of one shot. As he made the turn Friday, he drove into a bunker on the 515-yard, par-4 ninth hole, the hardest on the course. Using his 2-hybrid, the shot reached the green and rolled some 20 feet into the cup for an eagle. Considering the ninth was converted from a par 5, it felt like an albatross. As a footnote, Hubbard has since swapped the 2-hybrid for a 5-wood, "so it went out on top."
 3-IRON
 Dustin Johnson already had The Northern Trust won. All that was left when play resumed from a lightning storm was whether Louis Oosthuizen could birdie the par-5 18th. That would take him from No. 99 in the FedEx Cup to No. 70 and allow him to advance in the postseason. Oosthuizen had a 3-iron. He could barely see because of darkness. He drilled it over the hazard and onto the green to set up a two-putt birdie.
 4-IRON
 DeChambeau doesn't have to unleash the driver to show how much speed, power and distance he has added. In the final round of the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas, he came to the 15th hole at the TPC Summerlin. It was a reachable par 4 at 300 yards. DeChambeau hit his tee shot to 12 feet -- with a 4-iron -- and made eagle.
 5-IRON
 The turning point in the Masters came on the front nine Saturday. Dustin Johnson was part of a five-way tie for the lead going into the weekend when he hit a 5-iron to 2 feet on the par-5 second hole for an eagle. He birdied the next two holes, shot 65 and built a four-shot lead going into the final round of his victory.
 6-IRON
 Jon Rahm's victory at Olympia Fields is best remembered for that 65-foot birdie putt in the playoff to beat Johnson. But that playoff at the BMW Championship might not have happened without his 6-iron on the par-5 15th. Rahm pulled his tee shot left into the trees on the last easy scoring hole. He took a penalty drop, and then ripped 6-iron to 10 feet for birdie.
 7-IRON
 Patrick Cantlay had a one-shot lead in the Zozo Championship at Sherwood when he came to the 176-yard 15th, the pin to the right and just beyond the ledge of the rock-filled lagoon. He pictured a three-quarter 7-iron and pulled it off perfectly. The ball landed next to the pin, rolled out to 10 feet and set up only the fifth birdie all round on the hole. Cantlay went on to win by one shot.
 8-IRON
 Johnson was coming off back-to-back bogeys in the final round of the Masters, and his four-shot lead was down to one after five holes. That's when he hit the shot of the tournament, an 8-iron to the back right shelf on the par-3 sixth hole to 6 feet for birdie. No one got closer than two shots the rest of the way.
 9-IRON
 Cameron Smith showed plenty of grit and a little bit of luck while trying to chase down Johnson at the Masters. He made two unlikely birdies while hitting from among the trees, including the 9-iron on No. 9 that took him from hopeful of making par to an easy birdie to stay in the mix. But only briefly.
 PITCHING WEDGE
 Robert Streb had gone six years since his only PGA Tour victory and was happy to still be in the playoff with Kevin Kisner in the RSM Classic at Sea Island. From the left rough on the 18th hole, he hit a pitching wedge from 158 yards that came an inch from going in and led to victory.
 GAP WEDGE
 Patrick Reed was the center of attention in the Mexico Championship, mainly from Brooks Koepka saying he thought Reed had cheated in the Bahamas. Reed blocked out the noise to win, and key to it was his gap wedge on the 16th hole. Blocked by the edge of trees left of the fairway, he hit a hard hook that rolled along the ridge down to 3 feet for birdie.
 LOB WEDGE
 Rahm watched an eight-shot lead shrink to three at the Memorial, and then he went long of the par-3 16th. Facing a rock-hard green and a back pin, he hit a flop shot onto the fringe and watched it roll into the cup. That birdie became a bogey when video showed he slightly moved his ball. No matter. He won with what he called one of the great shots of his career.
 PUTTER
 Johnson and Rahm trading long, sweeping birdie putts at the BMW Championship were the most memorable. Equally big was Hovland ramming in a 30-foot birdie putt on the final hole to win the Puerto Rico Open for his first PGA Tour victory, the latest young player to win on a tour where it's getting harder to win every year.
 Especially a shorter year.

SPECIAL-OCCASION CAKES can be lovely, sure. But my family’s everyday contentment has taken a big step up with what Seattle native Yossy Arefi calls “snacking cakes” — quick and simple cakes that can do triple-duty as dessert, breakfast pastry or teatime nibble.
 “It’s cake for the sake of having some cake,” Arefi says by phone from New York City, shortly after the release of her “Snacking Cakes” cookbook (Clarkson Potter, $24). There’s a lot to be said for that.
 For a birthday earlier this year, for instance, I had spent hours whisking, grating, simmering, whipping and frosting a fabulous layered carrot cake. It was amazing. Time-wise, though, it was quite a contrast to Arefi’s swirled jam cake, which I whirled together in the few minutes before dinner one recent night. That little smackerel of goodness, as Winnie the Pooh might put it, was ready for dessert.
 After a short break another day, the extra pears I’d worried about eating before they overripened were sliced up to garnish a quick spiced pear cake. Optional rye flour added nuance to a chocolate cake made with cocoa powder and yogurt, then nutmeggy “powdered donut cake” was perfect for my coffee break a week later, while banana-buckwheat cake with tahini glaze sounded fancy and tasted fancy but also came together in a flash. Arefi’s all about substitutions and working with what you have on hand, so I could have made it without the buckwheat flour — and without the glaze — but I love both flavors, so I held out until my next shopping trip.

The Corvette's move to a mid-engine layout meant engineers had to change pretty much everything under the skin, including the car's suspension. Unlike the C7 before it, the C8 couldn't borrow its suspension layout from its predecessor, and had to be built from scratch. This video gives us our most detailed look at the design yet, along with expert analysis from an engineer.
 If you've been in a C8, you'll know it rides extremely well. It's able to cruise over bumps without issue, and handle corners with precision and poise. Dan Edmunds recently published this in-depth video on YouTube analyzing the C8 Corvette's front and rear suspension layout, providing some helpful insight into why it's able to perform as well as it does.
 The answer lies in the suspension's geometry. Because there's no engine up front and plenty of space in the rear, engineers had a lot of room to work with, giving the C8 a double-wishbone setup with large, long control arms all around. Importantly, they were able to give the car L-shaped lower control arms, meaning they could tune different bushings to absorb lateral forces and sharp road impacts, resulting in a better ride for occupants. It's amazing that just one generation ago, the Corvette was still using transverse leaf springs.

If you liked the way Monday rolled out, with its dense morning fog, blue sky stretches in the afternoon and glorious sunsets, you're in for a treat.
 The next seven days or so will basically be "carbon copies" of it, said Matthew Cullen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Seattle.
 Highs are expected to be right around 50 with lows in the upper 30s throughout the week. Those temperatures are very typical for us this time of year, but what's unusual is that there's no rain in sight, at least through early next week.
 That means it's going to be a dry weekend!
 Although the distribution of rain in November was uneven, with some very wet days and some dry ones, we ended up with 5.58 inches of rain at SeaTac International Airport, just a little below the November average of 6 inches, Cullen said.
 The first week of December is not often dry for those of us in Western Washington, and Cullen doesn't recommend that any plan for a whole month of dry.
 But in the meantime, he said, "enjoy this nice dry stretch in a time when it's usually wet."
