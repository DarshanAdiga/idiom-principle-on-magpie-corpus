After months of seeing the coronavirus ravage other parts of the world, COVID-19's widespread effect on the U.S. has increasingly begun to hit home for many Americans as they see as a growing number of people they know or are familiar with become diagnosed with the respiratory illness that has become a global pandemic. And after a brief spate of the fake news that Black people were somehow immune to contracting the coronavirus, a number of Black people have not only since been diagnosed but some have also died of complications from it.

It seems as if Lee is fully aware of the platform _Da 5 Bloods_ is held on. Simply put, the film is made with its Netflix viewership in mind. Jam-packed with dialogue serving to educate audience members about prominent Black military figures, Lee often includes handy visual aids, like an illustration of the Boston Massacre as Norman describes Crispus Attucks. It’s almost as if Lee is pausing the film for audience members, lecturing them on any figure they don’t instantly recognize.    _Da 5 Bloods_ could be characterized as imprecise filmmaking. The constant, drastic shifts in tone create a film that is sometimes all over the place. But its imperfections are, to an extent, what makes it so fascinating. Its powerful core, bolstered by excellent performances and a whole lot of strong political commentary, makes the film entertaining and, especially now, thought provoking.

The Fed will “provide results aggregated across banks that will compare how the banking system as a whole would fare under the three distinct views of the future,” he said.


  He noted that the February 2020 scenario is similar in “overall severity” to the most optimistic, V-shaped sensitivity analysis.


  Mr. Quarles said the virus scenario results could “inform our overall stance on capital distributions and in ongoing bank supervision.”


  While some current and former Fed officials have urged the central bank to halt dividend payouts by banks so that they retain more of their financial cushion, officials have so far declined to do so. Big banks have voluntarily stopped stock buybacks for the time being.


  The scenario analysis “will help the Board assess whether additional measures are advisable for certain banks or certain future developments,” Mr. Quarles said.


  His comments came shortly after Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and an influential economist within the central bank system, warned that states may be re-opening too quickly and imperiling the economic recovery in the process.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU/Gray News) - The famed “Bus 142” on the Stampede Trail has been removed by the state of Alaska, according to the mayor of the Denali Borough.Mayor Clay Walker said Thursday a coordinated effort between the State Departments of Natural Resources, Military and Veterans Affairs, and Transportation came up with the plan to remove the bus, a longtime attraction for travelers and hikers.The bus was made famous by the book and movie “Into the Wild” and turned into a pilgrimage site for travelers recreating the steps of Chris McCandless, who journeyed into the wilderness of Alaska in 1992 intending to live off the land. McCandless died, malnourished, in the old Fairbanks transit bus that had often been used as shelter by hunters in the wilderness west of the Teklanika River.However, that pilgrimage didn't come easy, as a number of rescues have been made on the river either for people who crossed the river and couldn't make it back, or for parties that went down the river.Last summer, a newlywed couple from Belarus found trouble in the river, and 24-year-old Veramika Maikamava was swept into the river and died.The Department of Natural Resources says at least one other person has drowned on their way to or from the bus since 2010.Walker says the removal of the bus is in the best interest of public safety - for the public and first responders.“We do believe that the removal of the bus will lessen the attraction,” Walker said. “Some people will still make that pilgrimage to that spot, but fewer people with that bus removed.”In March, after a rescue effort for five people in the area, Walker says the Borough Assembly was given a proposal to build a footbridge over the river, which it declined. At the same time, he said, the Assembly asked the state to remove the derelict bus."That river is a perilous river, and three people have died on the west side of it or in the river, and we believe the right thing to do for public safety is to remove that perilous attraction," Walker said.The Alaska Army National Guard airlifted the bus with a Chinook Helicopter, as a training exercise and no additional cost to the state, said Corri Feige, Alaska's Commissioner of Natural Resources, in a release.It was then loaded on a flatbed truck for transport.Walker said he didn't know the plan for the bus, which is now in the State of Alaska's possession.“They are putting it in safe storage currently and working on the plan,” he said.KTUU’s Mike Ross contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 KTUU via Gray Media Group, Inc.

Each Sunday, Larry Little and his wife, Mary, get ready for church. They dress casually, fill two tumblers with water, climb into their golf cart and drive two miles to The Grove, a grassy field next to their church.
   
 There they find a parking place, turn off the engine and settle in for a live service in front of a Jumbotron and a stage.
   
 The Littles, who live in a retirement community called The Villages, about an hour's drive northwest of Orlando, Florida, are among the lucky few.
   
 Since mid-March, when state shutdowns forced churches, synagogues and mosques to close amid the coronavirus pandemic, Americans have had to mostly rely on online worship services.
   
 But Live Oaks Community Church has been able to offer continuous outdoor services -- one on Saturday and two on Sunday -- with dozens, sometimes hundreds, arriving via their golf carts.
   
 "The only negative is that you don't have much interaction with the rest of the congregation," said Larry Little, 77. "Our golf carts are 6 feet apart and they don't want us outside the golf cart."
   
 For many, if not most, older congregants living in colder climates or with no access to outdoor services, such options are a luxury.
   
 Unable to find spiritual sustenance or the comforts of community, many are isolated and lonely. They may struggle with using the technology required for viewing online services or connecting virtually with family, friends and community members.
   
 "It's becoming more of a challenge to figure out how we minister to, and with, these older adults," said Missy Buchanan, a writer and speaker from Rockwall, Texas, with a focus on older adults.
   
 Some congregations are making phone calls and writing letters to older members. Others have bought them tablets and are teaching the least technologically savvy how to connect to online platforms.
   
 Now, as states begin loosening lockdown restrictions and churches contemplate how to reopen safely, clergy and other religious leaders face difficult decisions when it comes to their senior members.
   
 For older people, there's a cruel reality to those reopenings.
   
 Mounting evidence suggests houses of worship are probably among the riskiest places for older people. Transmission is much more likely indoors where lots of people come into close contact and where droplets with viral particles might linger in the air for as long as eight minutes. Multiple coronavirus cases across the country have been linked to people attending church and synagogue services or events.
   
 Older Americans are also among the most likely to develop a severe case of COVID-19. Eight out of 10 coronavirus deaths reported in the U.S. have been among adults 65 years and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   
 Many older people like the Littles may not see the insides of a church or synagogue for a very long time.
   
 "When churches regather, older people may be the last to go back," said Amy Hanson, an instructor in the gerontology department at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who has a consulting ministry to help churches engage older adults. "Some will want to return. But it will be hard for those who do go back. There'll be no handshaking and hugging -- things older adults are missing. They won't feel all they're hoping to feel."
   
 Older American were nearly twice as likely as younger Americans to attend church, synagogue and mosque before the shutdowns. A recent Pew Research survey found that 61% of those born before 1945 (the so-called Silent Generation) attended religious services monthly or more, compared with 35% of millennials (born between 1981 and 1996).
   
 In this in-between time, congregations should assess their older adult members, charting whether they live alone or have family nearby. Do they have hearing or vision impairments? Do they have access to chaplains at assisted living or nursing homes?
   
 They would also do well to recognize that older Americans are not monolithic in their needs, said Buchanan, who writes devotionals for older adults. Buchanan has identified four basic groups of older adults: the "go-go's," those who are still very active and independent; the "slow-go's," those who may have some physical limitations; the "no-go's," those who are homebound; and the "not-gonna-make-me-go," young Boomers who don't attend religious services on a regular basis.
   
 Many congregational ministries, Buchanan said, focus on only one or two of those groups.
   
 Large churches, such as Johnson Ferry Baptist Church in Marietta, Georgia, can do a lot more. In the days after the shutdown, the 7,000-member church prepared meals for many isolated church members and made daily phone calls to those living alone.
   
 Now the emphasis has shifted to finding ways to engage older adults and allow them to contribute to the life of the church.
   
 "They're not here to take up space," said Peggy Fulghum, minister to older adults at Johnson Ferry. "We want to keep them serving. I try to create ministries for them to be active and serve and give back to the community."
   
 For example, after noticing that in-person high school graduations were canceled, Fulghum asked older members to write congratulatory cards to high school seniors, encouraging them on their journey to adulthood and sharing a bit of their wisdom.
   
 The cards were mailed to the church and the church staff is now sending them to families with high school seniors.
   
 The church has also started a Tuesday morning Zoom call for older members where they can greet each other, sing a song and pray as a group. They hope it encourages groups of older adults to start their own Zoom gatherings. And the church is retooling its "GrandCamp" ministry to allow grandparents and children to interact through online projects.
   
 Live Oaks Community Church in Florida has recently announced it will resume indoor worship for up to 100 people with social distancing.
   
 The Littles, however, have decided to continue worshipping outdoors -- at least for the time being.
   
 "We think the golf cart experience is unique and we enjoy it," Larry Little said. "It's completely open and there's always a little breeze. You don't feel that sense of isolation. Isolation is worse than the virus for old folks."

Somewhat surprisingly the company, in its prospectus said it has no real competitors. My anecdotal checks confirm that most larger organizations really do not consider acquiring a lead generation platform other than that from ZI. Not all organizations believe that the cost of the platform can be justified, but if they are going to acquire a solution, ZI is their first stop in an acquisition process. Perhaps some readers will think of LinkedIn as an alternative, but the devil is in the details. For example, LinkedIn Sales Navigator has far less data depth and data integration and is not really integrated into the Salesforce (CRM) platform. There are plenty of niche, and legacy lead generation data sources, but they simply lack the scope and the AI technology that this company uses to provide its services.
 The result of this company’s competitive position is that it is far more profitable than most other higher growth IT vendors. While this company doesn’t rival Atlassian (TEAM) in terms of its spend on sales and marketing, its current sales and marketing ratio of less than 40% is far below average for most IT vendors. And so far, its spend on research and development, which is less than 10% of revenues is also surprisingly modest. When evaluating this company, the issue of margins and competitive positioning is a key factor. There are simply very few vendors in the IT world that have EBITDA margins of 50%.
 The concept behind ZoomInfo is embedded in its name. The company's software enables users to zoom into information that Zoom has collected, curated, and analyzed in order to improve the efficiency of their sales processes. Zoom’s solution is crafted to enable marketing teams to find the appropriate decision maker at a target enterprise, to determine when decision makers are preparing to make a purchase and to determine some kind of optimization between potential targets. There has always been a need for a comprehensive go-to- market solution that goes beyond the market intelligence handbooks that have been around for decades.

Some members of the local faith community find themselves on the other side of the fence from farmers when it comes to the management of migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The bishops of London and Hamilton have weighed into the discussion on bunkhouse quarantines in favour of Dr. Shanker Nesathurai, Norfolk and Haldimand's medical officer of health.
 Nesathurai has been under fire since he went above and beyond federal and provincial regulations in March and imposed a three-man-per-bunkhouse cap during offshore workers' mandatory 14-day quarantine.
 Farmers with large acreages have complained this is delaying the arrival of employees at a critical time of the growing season. Despite the vocal opposition, Nesathurai has Catholic dioceses in south-central Ontario in his corner.
 "We are aware that Dr. Nesathurai has worked tirelessly and at great personal cost to uphold the prudent 14 days of self-isolation in a safe and secure environment and has provided medical care when cases of the virus were identified,"  Bishop Ronald Fabbro, of the London diocese, and Bishop Douglas Crosby, of the Hamilton diocese, said in a letter to the Norfolk and Haldimand board of health this week.
 "Because of his professional oversight and humanitarian concern, migrant farm workers have, to date, received the high level of care expected in our country."
 Blessed Sacrament Church in Burford has weighed in because several of the 181 offshore workers diagnosed with COVID-19 at Scotlynn Group in Vittoria were lodged in Brantford and Brant County for the duration of their quarantine and recuperation.
 In a letter to Norfolk and Haldimand's board of health, Rev. Peter Ciallella, pastor at Blessed Sacrament, relates how churches and the general community in Brantford and Brant County prepared 221 gift bags for the entire Scotlynn workforce.
 Ciallella also supports Nesathurai's policies regarding migrant workers and bunkhouses. He expressed surprise that Ontario's Health Services Review and Appeal Committee deemed the three-man bunkhouse cap "arbitrary" and "unreasonable" in a ruling June 12 that struck it down. Ciallella suggested farmers look at the bigger picture and not simply focus on economic priorities.
 "The COVID-19 pandemic has required much sacrifice on the part of all citizens for the protection of the vulnerable among us," Ciallella says. "My own churches were closed for over three months and such a move was unprecedented and necessary."
 From the standpoint of the agricultural community, the economic interest is no small issue.
 Larry Davis, Norfolk, Haldimand and Brant's representative to the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, says farm families are at serious risk of losing their property and livelihood because of Nesathurai's actions. Nesathurai's three-man cap remains in effect due to an immediate appeal of the review board's ruling.
 "This appeal will mean a delay in worker processing and that Norfolk's farmers will lose valuable production this year and ultimately lead to many Norfolk farmers having to lose their farm and livelihood," Davis said in correspondence with the local board of health.
 "Further, some Canadians and world consumers will not have food."
 For his part, asparagus producer Ed Chromczak of Courtland, a director with the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, said this week that Nesathurai should be "removed from his position".
 "I also call to have his appeal revoked, therefore allowing the decision of the Health Services Appeal and Review Board to come into effect," Chromczak said in an email to the Norfolk and Haldimand board of health.

ZI uses its own technology as a foundation for its own go-to-market sales motion. That has seemingly worked out well given the company’s growth and its sales and marketing expense metric. As mentioned, the company is pivoting to an enterprise focus, and its large customer count trebled year on year in the March quarter while its total customer count rose by just 22%. I think focusing on the enterprise makes sense given the tiered pricing the company offers (it has 4 levels of capability) and the results that its users have apparently achieved by deploying the service.
 ## Some comments about management and the company’s business model
 I have mentioned the company’s business model several times during this article. The fact is that the business model constitutes one of the strongest points in making a buy recommendation for the shares. As mentioned, the company acquired its most notable enterprise competitors over the last year prior to the IPO and that has resulted in some optically distorted comparisons. But there is plenty of data in the prospectus with regards to the business model that is more than adequate for analytical purposes. The company has a gross margin of just over 80%. That is not terribly surprising since all of the company’s revenues come from subscription. Gross margins have increased by 600 basis points year over year.
 Sales and marketing expense grew by 86% year over year and remained at about 34% of revenues. Research and Development expense rose by 90% year on year and are now just over 10% of revenues. General and administrative costs rose by 50% year on year and are now 10,2% of revenues. As mentioned earlier, the company cut a bit less than 10% of its workforce in April; that might suggest that absent the one time severance cost (estimated to be less than $1 million) these ratios, especially in light of the first month sales numbers, could show improvement when the company reports its results later this summer.
 The company’s CEO is Henry Schuck. He is one of the founders of the business which has been around for more than a dozen years. Mr. Schuck has essentially spent all of his business career in this space as he was VP of Research and Marketing at iProfile a sales intelligence firm focused on the IT market.

One good thing about dating during COVID is that conversations get deeper more quickly with our shared experiences at this time. People are having more complicated, emotional, uncomfortable conversations; sooner. Fights about money are the second leading cause of divorce and occur more frequently the larger the couple's debt. Now that we're opening up to one another earlier in relationships, it's a good idea to bring up money sooner rather than later. And just not salary and spending habits, but goals and preferences. Do you eventually want to move to the suburbs? Do you want a house with a wraparound porch? A pool? Having these conversations will manage expectations and help you find someone on the same page as you.

To compound matters, some characters from the first season get less screen time.

Lucy Boynton’s Astrid is an icy delight, changing sides as regularly as she does outfits. However, her sudden appearances to rattle off vicious putdowns are few and far between. And although Gwyneth Paltrow flawlessly satirises the uber-liberal as Georgina (there’s a particularly brilliant moment when she offers Payton some terribly immoral advice before announcing, "I'm going to get stoned and have a bath"), her narrative ultimately feels tacked on.

3) Also, the amount of infrastructure Amazon has built to get consumers their products within just one day is unparalleled. The amount of capacity it has built has now put Amazon too far ahead of the competition to afford any opportunity to any peers, irrespective of size.
 What's more, during the lockdown, as consumers developed new habits, consumers' passion for physical shopping has slumped and is highly likely to continue deteriorating.
 Furthermore, in the long run, as white-collar workers became more in the habit of working from home, there's less need to live in highly-urbanized areas.
 These areas are often dirty, house prices are high, and quality of life is low. Consequently, as workers move out to suburbia, the ability to drop into malls and other shops will become increasingly challenging to do in the spur of the moment.
 Altogether, this creates a further tailwind to Amazon. Then, the next leg being, that high streets start to close down their shops, and with fewer and fewer shops, this creates a vicious circle where high streets become unappealing ghost towns. And who is the one clear winner from all this? You got it!
 ## Valuation - Still Undervalued
 In the past, I was an outspoken critic of Amazon.
 When investors were pounding the table arguing that Amazon could be worth $2 trillion, I passionately disagreed. In my naivety, I failed to comprehend the ultimate underlying dynamic.
 I would like to believe that today, I'm a better investor. And that it's better to be a late convert to this _religion_ than never at all.
 Everyone knows that Amazon is not priced off its bottom line. Amazon is solely priced off its top line and its ability to grow its revenues. Indeed, the tailwinds articulated above imply that Amazon's runway is not likely to stop anytime soon.
 Accordingly, despite its scale, it's not impossible for Amazon to continue growing its revenue growth rates in the 20% to 25% range.
 Thus, given that investors are only being asked to pay 4.5x sales, I can easily see that with enough stability in its revenue growth rates, if Amazon continues to grow in the 20% to 25% range, it would not be unreasonable for investors to pay 5.5x for Amazon's trailing sales.

Traffic also is expected to increase at the Falmouth Bridge and the U.S. 1 intersection with Princess Anne Street and Hanson Avenue, where traffic pattern changes will be made.


  Hanson Avenue traffic will be limited to right turns only onto southbound U.S. 1. Also, northbound U.S. 1 traffic will not be allowed to turn left onto Hanson.


  Traffic on the west side of the highway that would use Hanson or Riverside Drive—by heading under the Falmouth Bridge—to get onto the northbound U.S. 1 will not be able to do so. A utility project has temporarily closed Caroline Street there. That traffic will have to use Fall Hill Avenue to turn onto northbound U.S. 1.


  On Princess Anne Street, the ramp to northbound U.S. 1 will now have a stop- light signal, allowing traffic a green light for right turns toward the Falmouth Bridge.

At the time, not only was the cloud growing fast but AWS was opening and leading this rapidly-developing sector. However, once more, its narrative is about to change.
 What makes me say so? Surely, Amazon's AWS is _still_ important? Indeed, AWS is still crucial, but not as important to Amazon's medium-term future.
 In fact, we can already see that during Q1 2020, as 'shelter-in-place' became the norm in March, Amazon's AWS revenue growth rates actually _decelerated_ from its 2019 revenue growth rate of 37%, and went into Q1 2020 with revenue growth rates of just 33% compared with the same period a year ago.
 Again, I'm not implying that AWS is unimportant. My sole contention is that it is not _as_ _important_ to the growth narrative as it has been of late. So what should investors think about going forward?
 ## Obliterating The Retail Landscape
 Amazon's retail operations have a few critical advantages over its peers.
 1) Consumer habits are incredibly difficult to break. Consumers by default will look on Amazon for all their shopping news (at least in the West). This is a brainless activity. This has been known for a long time and doesn't add anything new to my thesis. Were it not for the second aspect.
 2) Amazon is under investigation for unfair practices. The problem being that Amazon is able to not only price its products ahead of other sellers, but it can indeed raise the prices of its own products without any competition. Raising prices on products, knowing that consumers are not in the _habit_ of price checking elsewhere for the same product, it's simply too much trouble. Further, Amazon has built a significant amount of trust or goodwill with consumers over time.
 Put another way, consumers are time-pressed and are willing to pay for the lowest friction transaction.
 Essentially, this is akin to a toll bridge, where consumers pass every day, and on different days, the toll road can charge different prices for the same product. When there's too much product that is not selling particularly well, the price goes down, and when there's a large demand, price rises mimicking real-time demand.

  Jeff Myhren now has the unique ability to say he coaches and teaches in Kinnelon, resides in Sparta and is a proud alumnus of Jefferson High School


   


  That may not seem all that intriguing to those unfamiliar with his situation, but it's caught the attention of high school hockey enthusiasts in Morris and Sussex counties in recent days.


   


  Myhren and Kinnelon athletic director Scott Rosenberg were informed Wednesday that the NJSIAA approved a tri-op merger between the Kinnelon and Sparta- Jefferson ice hockey programs. The merger is effective immediately for the 2020-21 season.


   


  "It was a must due to declining numbers and safety of the athletes," Myhren said. "Enrollment at Kinnelon is down over the last few years and now was the time to make a move. Our athletic director [Scott] Rosenberg has been working on this for quite some time and he was instrumental in making this happen."


   


  Myhren, a physical education teacher at Kinnelon, has been the Colts head coach since 2005 and will remain in the same position with the tri-op. Myhren's former player and Kinnelon alumnus Patrick Marcantuono will remain as an assistant coach.


   


  All three programs play and practice at Skylands Ice World in Hardyston Township, which Myhren said played into the decision to merge.


   


  "We're familiar with both the Sparta and Jefferson programs and it's a good fit that makes sense," Myhren said. "It allows the kids the opportunity to play hockey and be in a competitive environment."


   


  WILL THERE BE FALL SPORTS? NJAC administrators and coaches are unsure


   


  Prior to the merger, Kinnelon was the smallest stand-alone public school playing ice hockey in New Jersey, with an enrollment of 490 students. Despite declining numbers, the Colts 2019-20 roster still managed 19 total players, eight being upperclassmen.


   


  "At one time, we would get over 50 kids show up for tryouts," Myhren said. "We had a great run that lasted almost 10 years. We had a lot of success during that stretch, but times have changed."


   


  Kinnelon dropped down to the Halvorsen Division in 2017 and won the conference cup a year later in 2018. Prior to the move to the Halvorsen, the Colts played in the super-competitive Mennen Division for a while but struggled in recent years. Kinnelon posted a 16-35-9 overall record over the last three seasons.


   


  Sparta-Jefferson merged in the 2016-17 season and has also had their share of struggles, going 29-44-11 over the last four seasons, including 4-12-3 this past winter.


   


  The newly-formed tri-op will remain in the Halvorsen Division for the 2020-21 season.


   


  "Honestly, I don't know what I'm getting just yet with the two other schools," Myhren said. "We're trying to work out a meeting with all three teams, kids and families to discuss the future. It's not so simple right now considering the situation with COVID-19 and the state guidelines. We're looking forward to getting all three booster clubs together and work out the logistics. It's an exciting time and a new beginning."


   


  Co-ops and tri-ops have gained traction in New Jersey and have become viable options for programs facing declining numbers or budget issues.


   


  The Kinnelon and Sparta-Jefferson tri-op is the eighth of its kind in Morris and Sussex counties, joining High Point-Wallkill Valley, Morris Catholic- DePaul, Hanover Park-Whippany Park, Mountain Lakes-Boonton, Morris Knolls- Morris Hills, Parsippany-Parsippany Hills and Mount Olive-Hopatcong- Hackettstown.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU/Gray News) - The famed “Bus 142” on the Stampede Trail has been removed by the state of Alaska, according to the mayor of the Denali Borough.Mayor Clay Walker said Thursday a coordinated effort between the State Departments of Natural Resources, Military and Veterans Affairs, and Transportation came up with the plan to remove the bus, a longtime attraction for travelers and hikers.The bus was made famous by the book and movie “Into the Wild” and turned into a pilgrimage site for travelers recreating the steps of Chris McCandless, who journeyed into the wilderness of Alaska in 1992 intending to live off the land. McCandless died, malnourished, in the old Fairbanks transit bus that had often been used as shelter by hunters in the wilderness west of the Teklanika River.However, that pilgrimage didn't come easy, as a number of rescues have been made on the river either for people who crossed the river and couldn't make it back, or for parties that went down the river.Last summer, a newlywed couple from Belarus found trouble in the river, and 24-year-old Veramika Maikamava was swept into the river and died.The Department of Natural Resources says at least one other person has drowned on their way to or from the bus since 2010.Walker says the removal of the bus is in the best interest of public safety - for the public and first responders.“We do believe that the removal of the bus will lessen the attraction,” Walker said. “Some people will still make that pilgrimage to that spot, but fewer people with that bus removed.”In March, after a rescue effort for five people in the area, Walker says the Borough Assembly was given a proposal to build a footbridge over the river, which it declined. At the same time, he said, the Assembly asked the state to remove the derelict bus."That river is a perilous river, and three people have died on the west side of it or in the river, and we believe the right thing to do for public safety is to remove that perilous attraction," Walker said.The Alaska Army National Guard airlifted the bus with a Chinook Helicopter, as a training exercise and no additional cost to the state, said Corri Feige, Alaska's Commissioner of Natural Resources, in a release.It was then loaded on a flatbed truck for transport.Walker said he didn't know the plan for the bus, which is now in the State of Alaska's possession.“They are putting it in safe storage currently and working on the plan,” he said.KTUU’s Mike Ross contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 KTUU via Gray Media Group, Inc.

The antibodies that are gonna protect you are called IgA, Immunoglobulin A. These are the only antibodies that get made in any sort of abundance in your nose, mouth, throat, intestines -- all the places where the virus is going to come in. The idea is, if you make a good neutralizing able-to-stop-interaction IgA, that's going to prevent you from getting infected. In my book an ounce of prevention is better than the whole pound of antibody cure. And in everybody's book, I think.

Looking to 2021, a return to profitability will be difficult for the industry. Although economic activity is expected to improve sharply in 2021, returning to pre-crisis levels of air transport activity looks unlikely (RPKs will still be c.30% lower than 2019 levels). We expect the cautious behavior of travelers will continue to affect travel demand at the start of 2021 and the recovery in business travel will come with a lag. As in the Global Financial Crisis, industry-wide losses are expected to extend into a consecutive year. However, the losses in 2021 will moderate to $16 billion with the rise of revenues and the EBIT margin will improve from -23.4% to -4.2%.

Despite these statistics in L.A. and similar ones across the country that contradict the claim that blacks are victims of systemic racism, there’s no denying that many police departments need to rethink the ways they interact with the public, especially those living in poor communities where crime rates are higher.
 But while everyone is demanding that police departments fix themselves, shouldn’t somebody be saying to the black population and its leaders, “Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing to reduce violent crime in your own communities?”
 Where are the black political and moral leaders who will ask blacks tough questions like, “What are you doing in your community to build strong two- parent families, keep your marriages together and make sure your child gets a good education?”
 Where, by the way, is Barack Obama?
 Wouldn’t he be the perfect guy to be on TV right now asking the black community tough questions and challenging young people to cut the crap, shape up, quit thinking like victims and make successes of themselves the way he and so many other blacks have?
 Everyone agrees we need to get rid of the few bad police, train the many good cops better and treat all citizens equally under the law. But taking $150 million away from the police like they’re doing here in L.A. is not how to do that. It’s not going to make things better in the black community; it’s only going to punish the people who need the police most.
 Meanwhile, black leaders also need to be working to change the hearts and minds of the bad actors in their midst who cause the cops to come into their neighborhoods so often in the first place.
 Every encounter between a cop and a citizen, black or white, good guy or bad guy, is a potential tragedy, as we saw last weekend in Atlanta.
 The fewer encounters, the better it is for everyone. And the best way to keep the police out of any community, black or white or brown, is to not break the law.

He is also hopeful of a vaccine breakthrough, although he conceded it could take some time. “It’s hard to make 300 million of anything,” he said. “But right now, we’re doing everything we can to make sure we get there by the end of the year or January. There are five promising vaccines. We aren’t sure which will be best – but Congress has approved money to get to 300 million of each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Some of it will be wasted money, which we hate to do. But at the same time, we might find one is better for older people, another is better for younger people. We want to make sure that once we know those answers, once we know what’s best for each person, it’s available.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Barrasso also discussed the recent killing of an unarmed, African-American man in Minneapolis and the Black Lives Matter movement in general.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “What happened to George Floyd should never happen to anyone in America – and anyone who sees the video of him handcuffed and saying he couldn’t breath as another person kneeled on his neck for eight minutes, knows it should never happen. It hurts your heart to see it.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    He applauded the residents of Wyoming for the peaceful nature of their protests. But in other parts of the country, he said the movement “was hijacked by violent criminals trying to take over cities by looting, rioting and setting things on fire.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Barrasso said he believes police officers need more resources to do their jobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I’m completely opposed to people saying defund the police,” he said. “That’s the wrong way to go. We need to support police and law enforcement and do it in ways, like proper training, so what happened to George Floyd never happens again.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Barrasso said he supports putting body cameras on all police officers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “But they cost a lot of money and you can’t expect every police department to go out and buy them,” he said. “I think they need money from Washington to do that. We need to make sure all officers have those cameras – and if they happen to turn them off when something bad happens, that’s an offense.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    He said more must also be done to weed out bad police officers, like the one now facing second-degree murder charges in Floyd’s death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    He suggested a national database for police officers, similar to the one already in place for physicians. That database makes it more difficult for doctors who face disciplinary action in one state to jump around to other states seeking new employment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We were worried at one time about doctors having trouble in other places trying to come here,” he said. “But it can happen in any profession. It happens with the police. I believe it’s a small number, but we need to find ways to make sure the bad ones aren’t patrolling our streets. They aren’t keeping us safe; they are putting us more at risk.”

“The impact on agriculture, energy and tourism has really been damaging. It’s flatlined our economy,” he continued. “What I’ve been trying to do is make sure we keep our small businesses viable until we can fully reopen – and we are seeing good signs of that today.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Barrasso touted the Paycheck Protection Program, saying more than a billion dollars has been distributed to approximately 11,000 small businesses in the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I want to make sure that the program is working,” he said, calling it a great success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As a former physician and for 25 years the director of Wyoming Health Fairs, Barrasso also has a unique perspective on the challenges facing the state’s hospitals and health care workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Rural hospitals all around the country, and especially here in Wyoming, will tell you they operate on slim financial margins, and that when they have to close down some of the services they offer because they are waiting for virus patients to come in, that it really hits the bottom line,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “There are hospitals in Wyoming that haven’t admitted anyone with coronavirus, but their occupancy is way down because they’re only doing emergences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “So much of what we did in the CARES act was to make sure we had money for rural hospitals to be held harmless during all of this.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    While something had to be done to slow the spread of the virus, Barrasso acknowledged the societal cost of prolonged shutdowns. “We see it in the form of substance abuse, spousal abuse, child abuse and suicides,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    He also worries about people who delayed routine care, as well as those who missed the health screenings that typically occur during health fairs held around the state. Seven of those fairs have been cancelled this year, including the one in south Big Horn County.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “At every one of those health fairs, we do diagnostic blood testing looking for high cholesterol, thyroid, cancer, all those sorts of things. People didn’t have those tests this year,” he said. “There are also booths for the heart association and the diabetes association ... nobody benefited from those, either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “So that’s my big concern,” he continued. “You can’t just say it’s coronavirus versus nothing; it’s coronavirus versus everything else. There are other health impacts that come from an active, healthy economy and people getting out and about. If your only focus is coronavirus, you’ll never leave the house.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    When asked about predictions of second and third waves of the virus, Barrasso said the nation has made great strides. “We’re much better prepared right now because of testing, treatment and hospital capacity than we were when this thing first hit. In

The abolition of slavery in the U.S. was followed by the birth of Jim Crow segregation, relegating many black Americans to poor, redlined neighbourhoods with under-resourced schools. After the passage of landmark civil rights protections in the 1960s, decades of mass incarceration policy and employment discrimination eroded opportunities and economic stability for black people and families. All along, police brutality has been a fixture of the black American experience. And now, COVID-19 is killing black people at more than three times the rate that it kills white people.

Other researchers are looking at wildlife. In a recent paper published by the U.S. Geological Survey, experts on bats, wildlife, epidemiology and viruses concluded that there is a "non-negligible risk" of transmission of the coronavirus from humans to bats on this continent and a 33 percent chance the virus could spread within a North American bat population. That risk could be dramatically reduced if people who handle bats use personal protective equipment, according to the paper, which was based on preexisting knowledge, not surveillance or lab experiments.


  For the time being, researchers say cats should be a focus, because studies have found they are highly susceptible to the coronavirus and because they are common pets and roam freely in many places. In a study published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists infected cats with the virus and found that those cats could infect other cats. No felines showed symptoms, but the amount of virus they shed in nasal swabs was similar to that shed by some humans, said co-author Peter Halfmann, a University of Wisconsin virologist.


  "If a human can transmit to a human with this amount of virus being shed, it's definitely possible for a cat to transmit to a human," Halfmann said.

There is a question, how much money can Lebanon expect from the IMF? Given these discussions are ongoing as we speak, it's premature to talk about any potential access to the size of -- any potential access to IMF financing right now. The discussions are focused on policies and reforms to restore macro stability and sustainable growth. And, of course, at the end of the day, the support from the IMF, the scale and the size will be the decision of our Executive Board as is always the case.
