Vikrant Massey's showbiz journey began with TV in 2007 and he moved on to doing films in 2013. But that was not the end of him dabbling with different mediums. In fact the he is one of the first few actors to have got into the OTT game in its nascent stage in India."It has been a massive change," Massey says about the OTT platforms.He goes on to add, "Today in this pandemic situation where theatres were shut for months at stretch, we have had 50 films releasing and the number is going up across platforms. Big films are releasing and it was unprecedented 5 years ago. For me the larger idea had always been to be part of good stories, so yes that was a driving force."Massey, who has been a part of web films such as Cargo, Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare and Ginny Weds Sunny, all of which released this year, says, there was another reason why he took up the OTT projects.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vikrant Massey (@vikrantmassey87) "I come from TV and let's understand this thing that TV has the largest reach today. It always has and it always will. My priority after I left TV was to somewhere down the line reconnect with those audiences and I found this as a fitting platform. People who had forgotten me after I quit TV, I wanted to touch base with the same audiences again," he explains.The 33-year-old admits that him deciding to take up OTT projects was a good move on his part."In a lot of ways OTT has been a turning point in my career. And I am really thankful that I did things that I did and it worked out--be it Broken But Beautiful, Criminal Justice or Mirzapur," he says.Talking about what he thinks is the reason behind the meteoric rise of the OTTs in the country, Massey says, "There is lack of decent content on Indian TV, so we automatically, especially urban people, they steered towards OTTs."He further adds, "As an actor, I firmly believe that a crisp film does not give you time to play with the characters as much as you want to. A web series is like making three films, so you get time to settle down into the characters in a more deep way. I found that interesting. Simultaneously, I was consuming content from around the globe and as actor here came an opportunity to be a part of this change, I took it up."

The optimism on display just two months ago when Singapore Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung pledged to reopen the city-state and its tourism-reliant economy has taken a beating after a possible local coronavirus case was found aboard one of Royal Caribbean Cruise Ltd.'s ships. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, the 1,680 passengers on Quantum of the Seas -- enjoying day three of a four-day cruise to nowhere -- and 1,148 crew were alerted to an announcement that a suspected case of Covid-19 had been discovered, the voyage was being cut short and everyone should remain in their staterooms.It was the second blow in as many months after a highly anticipated air travel bubble with Hong Kong was axed before it even started, leaving would-be travelers on both sides of the South China Sea stranded, their hopes of quarantine-free reunions with family and friends dashed. As Wednesday dragged on, some people on the ship, now back at the Marina Bay Cruise Centre, took to their balconies for fresh air in an all-too familiar 2020 sight -- another floating palace, docked but isolated as the arduous process of contact tracing and testing gets underway.The 83-year-old male who tested positive was found to be negative in a subsequent test, though health officials plan to conduct an additional test, Singapore Ministry of Health said. By late Wednesday, all passengers had disembarked. They were tested before being allowed to leave the terminal."Even in the early days of the pandemic, cruise ships posed a high risk of outbreaks, and these in turn can spill over into communities," said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Australia. "The pandemic today is far, far worse than it was in May, when cruising stopped. This means the risk of an infected passenger boarding or an infected staff member being on board is higher now."Singapore's ill-fated attempts to enliven tourism underscore the difficulties of getting any sort of travel up and running even in a nation where community cases have been close to zero for several weeks. Stringent protocols to permit the pilot sea voyages had been established, including extensive testing of crew and passengers. The cruises, including another that's being run by Genting's World Dream, were also required to sail at a reduced passenger capacity of 50%.All 2,828 people on Quantum of the Seas had tested negative when the ship departed Dec. 7, according to a statement from the Singapore Tourism Board. There was also increased sanitization and improved fresh air circulation.Ultimately, those measures plus others that included mask-wearing at all times, social distancing and buffets staffed by servers in protective gear may have proven insufficient to combat a virus that's still raging in Europe and the U.S. Globally, more than 68 million people have been infected and some 1.6 million are dead.Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said the case onboard was "not unexpected," according to a ChannelNewsAsia report, and that the government was prepared for such a situation. The public can be assured that such incidents can be managed properly with the protocols that have been put in place, he said.Singapore isn't alone in stumbling. As the coronavirus resurges in Japan, politicians and experts are growing more divided on the impact that a subsidy program encouraging people to travel is having on the spread of infections. A popular "Go To Travel" campaign, which discounts trips to boost regions hit hardest by a lack of tourists, is one of the government's most prized projects for spurring the economy, and has been heavily backed by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.In Bali, a plan to reopen to foreign visitors in September was scrapped due to a resurgence in cases while Thailand, another popular tourist destination in Southeast Asia, is taking baby steps, allowing just 1,000 international tourists in October versus the some 3.1 million it hosted the same period last year.Escalating virus numbers in Hong Kong have meant the air travel bubble with Singapore won't start until 2021. The arrangement, initially set for Nov. 22, will be reviewed between Christmas and New Year.In a sign of how desperate residents of Singapore are to go somewhere beyond the island's tiny confines, escapes including luxury overnight camping at Changi Airport and daycations at beach hotels at Sentosa, an enclave off the south coast, are booked solid.Seats on Singapore Airlines Ltd.'s superjumbo-turned- pop-up restaurant in October sold out in 30 minutes, with some paying upwards of S$600 ($450) for a meal in a suite on the stationary Airbus SE A380. And the government has launched its own domestic tourism campaign, with S$320 million in credits set aside to encourage residents to support local businesses."It's obviously disappointing, disappointing for those that had travel to Hong Kong planned, and disappointing for those on the cruise," said Dale Fisher, an infectious diseases physician at Singapore's National University Hospital who also chairs the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. "But there needs to be an expectation that things can change because we're trying to do it safely. This isn't going to have a fairytale ending and we wake up one day and it's all over."(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

New DelhiIn today's world, especially in times like these, social media has emerged as a saviour in helping everyone stay connected. However, along with the good, the online world is getting toxic by the day. Joining the list of celebrities voicing their views against social media negativity, actor Sunny Leone shares that it's time we get back to spreading happy and positive vibes in that space. "I really believe that social media needs to serve the purpose of whoever it is that is posting things online. I'm not very happy about what's going on but there is nothing that you can do about it. Everybody is angry and upset about what's going on. There seems to be some amount of discrimination or things that have hurt people about ways that they were treated. I do think that bullying, mistreatments and all such type of negative behaviour just comes around. I feel that someone who is bullying probably has been bullied. It is a chain of nasty behaviour," she says.Leone shares that the only way that we can change that is if we can change one person's view at a time and bring positivity back in our lives. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sunny Leone (@sunnyleone) "I hope when people look at my social media, I'm able to bring a smile on their face. Nobody wants to be a part of such negativity that's out there. I avoid reading all the comments as the negative ones aren't truly worth it. It's better to just ignore or block themâ¦ Not everyone out there is bad. We're just messed up right now. All of us are fragile mentally. We need to come together as a world and share love and positivity," explains the actor, who's upcoming work includes the Bollywood project Koko Kola, a TV reality show, a film down south and two digital projects.Having done Karenjit Kaur - The Untold Story of Sunny Leone and Ragini MMS Returns 2 earlier, Leone is kicked about exploring the digital space. Against social media negativity is the positive side of the web that has ushered in a change in the industry by broadening its horizon leading to more work opportunities."I believe what's happening since the last few years is that the industry as a whole has been expanding in an enormous way. When you talk about the digital space, there's so much that we can do as actors. When you're watching a film, you're watching a two-hour or a 90-minute-long story but there's no time to get into the nitty gritty of the characters. And that's what I love about digital shows, which establishes every character with a back story."Meanwhile, Leone is also discussing a few films offers and if things fall into place work on one of them starts next year. This is also an out-and-out commercial film. While she has mostly worked in such projects, when asked if she's keen on exploring parallel/artsy space, Leone shows interest."I'm ready to do it if there's a great story and all the puzzle pieces together that is how it's going to happen, what are the promotional and marketing plans, and the shooting timelines? I also need to know the demographic that it's going to hit, how it's going to impact the viewers in a positive way. I do get such offers but haven't come across any such project that got me interested. But if I were to do one I would want to produce it myself. In fact there are a couple of stories that I want to introduce but it's too early to talk about it," she concludes.Follow @htshowbiz for moreAuthor tweets @Shreya_MJ

New York-based SpringOwl Asset Management LLC has conducted surveys that show 80% of respondents who have never cruised say they would avoid getting on a cruise."There's reputational damage for the industry," SpringOwl Chief Executive Officer Jason Ader said. "People don't want to get stuck out on a ship and not be able to get off. That memory of people stuck on a ship because of an outbreak is still fresh and it's going to take time to fade."Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said the case onboard was "not unexpected," according to a ChannelNewsAsia report, and that the government was prepared for such a situation. The public can be assured that such incidents can be managed properly with the protocols that have been put in place, he said.Despite cruise ships mandating passengers take coronavirus tests before boarding, the risk of disease transmission exists because of its long incubation period, which can be as long as 12 days.A few cruise companies that have restarted operations have run into problems with infections on board. SeaDream Yacht Club, a Norway-based company, canceled its remaining cruises scheduled to sail in 2020 after a cluster of Covid infections were found on board a vessel sailing in the Carribean in November, despite passenger testing before boarding. In August, Hurtigruten Group AS, another Norwegian cruise ship operator, was forced to apologize and cancel upcoming cruises after a coronavirus outbreak on one of its ships.Vaccinations Critical"There's always a chance of catching a virus on a cruise. You can have a negative test at the moment, but if the transmission occurred in the last few days, they could be infected and not yet show signs of the virus," Ben Cowling, head of the epidemiology division at the University of Hong Kong, said.Cowling said vaccinations will be critical in assuring safety on cruise ships. "Once the elderly and most vulnerable have been vaccinated, then the virus won't be a huge concern for cruise ships anymore."Singapore isn't alone in stumbling.
