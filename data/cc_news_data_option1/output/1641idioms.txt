In fact, as you look through the list of _Entrepreneur_'s Top 100 Homebased Franchises, you'll find that many of these companies can thrive without an office or retail space, because the franchisees don't wait for business to come to them; rather, they are busy bringing their products and services out into the world for customers to enjoy. Whether it's cleaning, tutoring, event planning or selling shaved ice, if you decide that homebased is the way to go, you and your employees are likely to spend more time out and about than lounging on the couch.

With the app, you can create your own private room where you can video chat with up to 10 friends at one time allowing you to see their reactions to YouTube videos, television shows, and movies. Or you can play music and allow those in the room to enjoy some tunes with you. And if you'd like, you can even share your own photos and videos with those in the room.  
   
 The person who creates the room can make it a Secret room or a Party room. With the latter, friends of all of the room members are welcome to visit. And video chats can be customized by using animated stickers, face masks, and sound reactions. YouTube and SoundCloud are integrated into the app along with some movies and TV shows. The movie library is a bit eclectic with titles ranging from Shrek to Donnie Darko. If you'd rather share some television shows, there is Hell's Kitchen, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, Storage Wars, and more. And a search bar helps you find YouTube content for everyone to view. Airtime recommends inviting five or fewer people into a room for the best experience.
   
 Airtime is the perfect app for a pandemic because it allows you to safely have fun with your friends without risking your life and the lives of your pals. Another app that allows you to create virtual rooms and share some times with friends is the heavily promoted Houseparty (iOS|Android). You can video chat with friends and their friends, and play games with them too. However, there have been complaints from some former Houseparty subscribers that the app hacked into their Spotify and bank accounts. If you have installed this app, you need to be careful and monitor your personal financial accounts for any strange transactions.

If your product is significantly more expensive than other similar, existing products, that's cause for reflection.

Champion of the Fields is the next-best thing if you’re looking for an alternative of the two big names in soccer games. The game looks good and has precise controls so you can make the right play in every situation. You get to see some familiar player names, just don’t expect the flashy-ness and grandiose of FIFA. This game is more about the experience on the field than what you don between matches. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t strive to assemble the best team possible, of course. As with other games, better players will improve your chances to land that top corner shot from an impossible angle and lead you to victory. At the end of the day, however, if your thumbs don’t have the dexterity, you won’t be getting the W, so start practicing!

In light of the risks of exposure in Kakuma-Kalobeyei, UN-Habitat has been supporting the process and has carried out a preliminary assessment to identify gaps and target initial response measures. Part of the assessment involved mapping current responses and identifying points-of-entry for advisory and technical support, leveraging on UN-Habitat's expertise in promoting spatial urban function and strategies for mobility and circulation.

 During this COVID 19 crisis, the liberals in recent letters have criticized President Trump for "failure to lead." Let's look at what's really happened.
   
 We have to go back to Trump's program of calling out China for it's continual and endless trade abuses and taking action to rectify the situation. The Democrats immediately screamed and said that China is really our friend and we shouldn't disrupt our "relationship." Trump pointed out then how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had been lying, cheating, and stealing ever since they became trade partners as a result of Nixon/Kissinger.
   
 Unless you've been hiding in a cave for the last few years, you now realize that Trump was absolutely correct in this assessment. In addition, the CCP is responsible for such atrocities as harvesting organ transplants from political and religious prisoners.
   
 Not only is the CCP a pack of lying, cheating thieves, they now can add to their list the title of worldwide pandemic creators! The virus research labs in Wuhan have been partially funded by the US and Canada among others until recently. As recently as 2018, the US State Department found that the labs had extremely poor safeguards in place. As a result, the evidence now points to a female intern in the lab becoming accidentally infected, infecting her boyfriend and then he spread it through the so called "wet markets" in Wuhan.
   
 The Chinese culture of not wanting to "lose face" especially in the CCP has led to outright lies, distortions, and misinformation to the world. If the CCP had been forthcoming and admitted their mistakes, then this whole pandemic could have been easily contained. By the account of most world wide experts (other than the WHO) the Chinese death count should be 10x higher than reported, but the CCP will never admit the true facts.
   
 We all know about the Chinese doctor who discovered the virus, tried to warn the world, was shut down and then eventually died from the infection. The Chinese also stockpiled PPE afterward and are now charging us inflated prices for them.
   
 When Trump stopped all flights from China, there was 1 death in the US from COVID-19 at that time. Shortly after, he blocked flights from Europe and the Democrats screamed that this was unnecessary! Now, the same far left liberals are screaming that Trump didn't do enough.
   
 The major problem here in the US has been the lack of rapid availability of test kits and back log in the labs doing the testing. For those of you that think the Deep State is fiction, you only have to look at why we had this problem.
   
 CDC and FDA are entrenched bureaucracies that regulate the creation of tests and treatments with no regard for the urgency of the situation. Other countries quickly waived the red tape to get things moving, but it took an executive order by Trump to override the regulations and proceed forward.
   
 At this point, we know the true culprit is China and the CCP. So, all of you Trump haters out there need to grow up and direct your wrath in the right direction.
   
 The US needs to be looking at financial reparations from China, possibly in the form of seizing Chinese assets and bank accounts in the US, writing off US debt to the Chinese in the form of T Bills etc.
   
 People who are worried about damage to relations with China should be aware that our relations with China have been destroyed by their lies and deceit.
   
 As far as I'm concerned, our relations with China are over. We should pull all of our manufacturing out of China and back into the US and other countries.
   
 We should find other sources for our raw drug supply. And, we should enlist the rest of the world to do so as well!

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women, and over the years, pharmaceutical and life sciences companies have been conducting advanced research and development activities to devise newer treatment options and drugs to treat breast cancer. Several new drug formulations are currently in the pipeline in different stages of clinical development and this is expected to bode well for the triple-negative breast cancer treatment market. Innovation in oncology therapeutics has shifted focus towards an outcome based approach to cancer care, with an increasing emphasis on combination drugs and newer therapeutic modalities. This is further likely to put the global triple- negative breast cancer treatment market on a positive growth trajectory in the coming years.

Not a chance, you might say, but one barbershop in Tokyo is trying to make the impossible possible.
 In what may be an industry first, Mr. Brothers Cut Club, whose flagship store is located in the fashion mecca of Harajuku, has launched what it calls a “telecut” service, in which its barbers will offer customers self-haircut tutorials in real time via the Zoom video-conferencing app.
 “We figured many people are getting annoyed at how their hair keeps growing while they're staying at home,” said Saito Kon, one of the Mr. Brothers barbers.
 “But the only option they have at the moment is either to risk infection by venturing outside to get a haircut, or to do nothing as their hair keeps growing.”
 So the barbershop decided to offer a temporary solution to that problem.
 Customers interested in the telecut service need to prepare a simple collection of necessary paraphernalia themselves, such as scissors, clippers, a garbage bag and a portable mirror. There are two service options — one for parents trying to trim the hair of their children, and the other for adults looking to cut their own hair. English-speaking staff are also available, too.
 Mr. Brothers admits the telecut initiative is more of a "quick-fix" measure, unlikely to blossom into a viable business model. No matter how adept barbers have become at online tutorials, “We can’t really guarantee that customers can get the perfect, high-quality haircut they would look for at barbershops,” Kon said.
 “The best we can do is teach them how not to mess up,” he said, adding that the initiative boils down to him and his colleagues trying to “make a social contribution.”
 The service is free of charge.
 But the project also reflects a message that barbers at Mr. Brothers want to get across to men nationwide who are growing increasingly indifferent to self- grooming as they go out less and less.
 “I know many guys are taking perfunctory care of how they look during this stay-at-home period, but we hope this initiative will make them stay motivated about their appearance,” Kon said.
 Like many barbershops and beauty salons across the nation, Mr. Brothers has not been immune to the economic fallout of the pandemic.
 “Customers have halved from the period before COVID,” Kon said with a sigh. “Not that there's much we can do about it. We just need to hang tough.”

MORTON -- Morton Pumpkin Festival organizers said Saturday they'll announce July 7 what changes will be made to keep crowds, volunteers and vendors safe at this year's festival during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 The festival is scheduled for Sept. 16-19.
   
 "We should know by July 7 what size groups will be allowed to gather (in September)," said Leigh Ann Brown, executive director of the Morton Chamber of Commerce.
   
 "The festival is all about getting together and giving back to the community," Brown said. "There are family reunions and class reunions planned around the festival. We're brainstorming ideas while buying time to see what the festival could look like."
   
 Chamber staff and board members and the Morton Pumpkin Festival Advisory Committee are consulting with other festival organizers, vendors and public health officials to determine the safest ways to hold the festival, according to a news release issued by the chamber and committee.
   
 The festival is the chamber's major fundraiser each year and it generates thousands of dollars for Morton community groups.
   
 "Roaring Pumpkins and All That Jazz" is the theme of the 2020 festival.

He is looking at the best ways to raise capital and to scale (up to now, he has been investing revenue back into the company), and is hopeful for the passage of legislation that would establish a class of "low-volume motor vehicle manufacturers," allowing him to build cars from scratch, rather than salvage.

P-hydroxybenzoates are derived from benzoic acid, which is widely used in the agro food industry as a preservative and antioxidant. The global p-hydroxybenzoates market is expected to grow on the back of increasing demand for efficient food preservatives. The growing demand for p-hydroxybenzoates parabens to be used as germicide and antiseptic in cosmetics, and as preservatives in medicine, cosmetics, and foods is expected to be the key factor driving the growth of the global p-hydroxybenzoates market. However, stringent rules and regulations regarding the use of p-hydroxybenzoates and its parabens used in food preservation is expected to hamper the growth of the global p-hydroxybenzoates market during the forecast period. A risk assessment was carried out on the effects of the parabens of p-hydroxybenzoates used in food preservation, and it was concluded that propyl parabens would be excluded from the list due to research that demonstrated their harmful effects on reproductive abilities of rats. However, increasing demand for preservatives in food and cosmetics is expected to fuels the growth of global p-hydroxybenzoates market during the forecast period.

Development of generics is another key opportunity area in the triple-negative breast cancer treatment market. With the rapidly expanding number of cancer cases across the world, there is a need for effective cancer management, including the provision of better and more efficient drugs. Developing economies are faced with challenges on several fronts including paucity of funds and lack of proper treatment options, calling for more innovative approaches to affordable healthcare. The availability of biosimilars and affordable generic anti-cancer drugs in developing regions is expected to significantly reduce the burden of cancer care. A projected cost reduction to the tune of more than 30% - 40% and extended use of generic drugs is expected to reduce overall cancer treatment costs, thereby increasing the treatment rate for triple-negative breast cancer. This is further anticipated to create lucrative growth opportunities in the global triple-negative breast cancer treatment market.

Rain, rain and more rain. It hasn’t been a biblical 40 days and 40 nights but sure seems like it. A record sopping-wet winter has creeks running high, swift and heavy with silt. Pockmarks dapple a drift of rain-pelted sand, and more rain’s coming but that old fisherman’s chair refuses to be swept downstream. It holds wayward limbs and leaves, and for me, memories of a youth spent fishing.
 This creek would have suited a fisherman by the name of Harry Hampton. He would have been right at home here. He would have taken comfort in knowing his namesake organization, the Harry Hampton Wildlife Fund, serves as a steward of woods and waters. It wouldn’t have been the best time to fish but a good time and place to think about fishing and a favorite fish of many, bream.
 Folks fish for bream in some creeks but in my day I fished for bream in Granddad’s farm ponds where those greenish, bronze, deep-bodied fish darted about like torpedoes. It was there that Grandmother Poland taught me to fish. She kept red-varnished cane poles beneath the overhang of the concrete block annex where Granddad cooled green watermelons with zigzagged dark stripes. A new thing called monofilament had yet to make its way into fishing and those cane poles sported black nylon lines. And the corks? Red-and-white bobbers, of course.
 We never bought bait. Grandmom taught me to dig worms beneath cow piles. She taught me, too, that you’re sure to catch a fish if a dragonfly lands on your cork. I always felt lucky. The clatter of dragonflies filled the air. Deft as damselflies they flitted over lily pads. They zoomed. They zigzagged. Then, light as ash, a blue darter would land on my red-and-white cork. Sunlight blazed up in its cellophane-like wings, and its body fired up iridescent blue. I just knew I’d catch a big fat bluegill, and often I did. The red-and-white bobber would dive beneath the surface and a bluegill would turn its broad side against me and become a 10-pound fish. When I landed it my heartbeat 130 beats a minute.
 I promise you the days I spent as a boy fishing were my best. Pure bliss. There were no jobs, nothing called a career, no demands, and no stress other than snagging a hook on a stump or willow. I used a cane pole until I was old enough to cast a Zebco. That’s when I graduated from bream to bass and always kept my Zebco and rod and black rubber worms close by.
 I lived like a prince in Granddad’s kingdom where palatial riches—blue farm ponds—waited around the bend of every cow path. And so I associate farm ponds with varnished cane poles, red-and-white bobbers, mats of algae that betrayed snakes’ serpentine wanderings, jelly-like clumps of frog eggs, and the heavy wooden boat Granddad made with ever-present moccasins beneath—treasures like no others.
 I never fished a creek, what old folks called a crik. “You fellas been swimmin’ in the crik?” Here we have a crik I’m certain Harry Hampton would have loved. Had Harry sat in that veteran of a chair might he have made a few notes about this rain-swollen creek? I believe so, and so I close my eyes for a moment as all that water rages, and I see bream skulking downstream of a sunken log and beneath cuts and overhangs. If I close my eyes a bit longer, I see Hampton’s long legs crossed and stretched out across all that dimpled sand. His feet almost touch the water. He’s got a pad and pen in his hands. He’s listening to waters roar, watching as winds toss treetops about, and all he hears are the sounds of nature.
 “Better days ahead,” he writes. “Come spring and summer this creek will be a fine place to take kids fishing, and teach them about nature. It’ll make a good column, ‘Lessons From The Old Fishing Hole.’ ”
 Had Harry sat here the day I photographed that old chair, I’d have told him about Granddad’s ponds and asked him how creek fishing goes. And one more thing. Is it really good luck when a dragonfly, the old snake doctor of yesteryear, lands on your cork? I have no doubt he’d say, “Yes. Your grandmother was right as rain. In fact, fishing itself will bring you good luck and more. It teaches you about life, and you’ll never regret it.”

Every descendant of a Holocaust survivor, every freedom-loving Pole or Czech who endured Nazism and Stalinism, every starving soul trying to survive Venezuela today in order to taste freedom tomorrow knows that nothing can eradicate human liberty, so long as some voice, somewhere, can still remind others that God's gift of freedom is theirs by right.  Life and liberty go hand in hand.  When so many politicians these days seem comfortable with allowing the wolves of tyranny to nibble at the edges of both, there has never been a more important time to scream back, "Not on our watch!"

One of the great American garage bands of all time, out of nearby Boise, Idaho. These guys pumped out a parade of Top 10 hits, and their colonial attire only added to the fun. They were the house band on the weekday, late afternoon dance show, “Where the Action Is.” I would rush home from school so that I could watch it on our little black and white television. These songs were terrific fun to sing along with (still are) and were a huge part of the Golden Age of Top 40 AM radio in the 1960s. Dance party songs including “Kicks,” “Just Like Me” and “Hungry” stand the test of time and are still fresh.

Australian cricketers are not going to be “greedy” if they are asked for a pay cut as it is important that the game thrives well into the future in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Test captain Tim Paine.
 With India’s tour of Australia and the upcoming T20 World Cup in doubt due to the fast-spreading coronavirus, Cricket Australia has already stood down 80% of its staff and now is in talks with Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) regarding a potential players’ pay cut.
 “Players need to know the absolute financial positions of the game and the players aren’t going to be greedy,” Paine said on ABC Radio.
 “Our livelihood, all the people associated with the CA and the players association, their livelihood is dependent on the game of cricket being healthy.
 “So at the moment if a pay cut for us is on the cards and that keeps our game thriving well into the future, then that’s something we’ll certainly have to look at.”
 Cricket Australia might lose a staggering AUD 300 million dollars if the Indian team fails to turn up for the bilateral series due to the global health crisis.
 Australia’s borders are sealed till September 30 but in a bid to salvage the India tour, the government is considering providing international exemptions to allow the Indian team arrive in Australia.
 The 35-year-old Paine said he is not aware of any contingency plan if the India tour doesn’t go ahead and hoped Virat Kohli and his men can arrive in Australia as planned.
 “I haven’t just yet and I don’t want to be. I’m hoping that they get here, that would solve a lot of issues,” Paine said.
 “I know there’s been some early talks with Cricket Australia and the government around the potential of what could be done, chartering planes and getting them in isolation when they get here to make sure that we can get India here.
 “But apart from that I’ve only heard a few things on the rumour mill about maybe New Zealand coming out and us going there.”
 Asked about Michael Clarke’s claims that the Australians had “sucked up” to Indian captain Kohli in recent years to protect lucrative IPL deals, Paine said the former Aussie captain should have taken individual names if he wants to take people on.
 “If you’re going to come out with a big quote and try and take people on and cause any sort of trouble and have a crack at people, I think you name people individually and he certainly didn’t,” Paine said.
 “It was certainly unfounded because I was out on the field and there was no one taking it easy (on Kohli),” he added.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-GEORGIAGeorgia restaurants allowed to reopen as restrictions loosenATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s reopening is set to continue as more restrictions against the coronavirus are loosened in the big Southern state. Movie theaters on Monday can welcome customers and limited in- restaurant dining may resume. This comes after other businesses, including barbershops, gyms, tattoo shops and nail salons, were allowed to start seeing customers Friday. Many establishments gratefully opened their doors after a monthlong closure, but others didn’t feel ready yet amid the pandemic and remained shuttered. A similar mixed response is expected from the businesses allowed to reopen Monday.PREGNANT WOMAN KILLEDPregnant woman found shot to death in GeorgiaMACON, Ga. (AP) — Sheriff's deputies in Georgia are investigating the shooting death of a pregnant woman after her 11-year-old son found her unresponsive in her bed. The Bibb County chief coroner, Leon Jones, identified her as 36-year-old Melanie Powell of Macon. Deputies said Powell was shot in the head. The death was reported to authorities Sunday and is being investigated as a homicide.LAND CONSERVATION$7M to improve land and water in Florida, GeorgiaTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A land conservation group is getting $7 million in federal money to improve land and water in parts of the Florida Panhandle and south Georgia.

Tall Timbers says it will use the money to improve water quality, wildlife habitat and economic opportunities in the watersheds of the Aucilla and St. Marks rivers. The project will buy conservation easements, help with habitat management on public and private lands, and share costs to improve farmland.VIRUS OUTBREAK-CONTACT TRACINGMany states fall short of mandate to track virus exposureATLANTA (AP) — As more states push to reopen their economies, many are falling short on one of the federal government’s essential criteria for doing so — having an efficient system to track people who have been physically near a person infected with the coronavius. A review by The Associated Press finds a patchwork of systems around the U.S for conducting so-called contact tracing. The AP found that most states are scrambling to hire and train enough people to do the work. With few exceptions, the states reviewed by AP are going it alone. Most other countries take a national approach.STINGING CATERPILLAR SEASONStinging buck moth caterpillars active in some statesSTARKVILLE, Miss.

They're fearsome-looking critters, armed with rows of branched spines that are attached to venom glands. Even a glancing touch from a falling caterpillar brings instant pain and swelling. Mississippi extension service entomologist Blake Layton says the best defense is to know about the caterpillars and avoid close contact.RACIST TEXT-INVESTIGATIONGeorgia officials investigate racist text to Atlanta mayorATLANTA (AP) — Georgia officials are investigating a racist text received by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. A spokeswoman for Attorney General Chris Carr said Friday that the Republican has directed his office’s prosecution division to investigate who sent the text. Bottoms on Wednesday tweeted that she got a text to her personal cellphone addressing her by a racial slur and telling her “Just shut up and RE-OPEN ATLANTA.” Bottoms is an African American Democrat who has been an outspoken critic of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to allow some businesses to resume operations.

Their approach stands in contrast to numerous Democratic governors who continue to maintain a cautious approach to reopening and have said they will base their decisions primarily on public health data. Governors pushing to fast-track their economic rebounds say they don’t want to endanger their residents, but numerous public health experts say that is what could happen if they don't slow down.SEVERE WEATHERKemp tours storm-damaged towns in south GeorgiaADEL, Ga.

The storm system tore through the South on Thursday, killing at least seven people in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. In Georgia, a suspected tornado swept through Adel, tearing off roofs and flipping at least one car and a small plane. The twister came about a block from the offices of The Adel News-Tribune. The newspaper’s general manager says the city’s old train depot was heavily damaged.

It's a song of an apocalyptic title that will resonate over time, Mick Jagger said for the "Apple Music" group, adding that the song was written last year but has adapted part of the text to the current situation, according to US media.      "Keith Richards and I had the idea to release the song but edited it," said Jagger on the occasion of a new single released after a long break and the first original material after "Doom and Gloom" and "One more shot."      "Living in a Ghost Town" is a lament over life that has restrictions, with verses that can relate to those who are forced into isolation and social distance worldwide. Mick Jagger has opined that he thought the tune "would resonate through the times that we're living in right now."      "Life was beautiful, then we all got locked down", the text reads, adding, "Please let this be over. Feel like a ghost, living in a ghost town."      Last week, band members who, like everyone else, were in isolation, took part in a charity concert sponsored by WHO, organized by Lady Gaga, performed the hit "You Can't Always Get What You Want".      Part of the new song is, as Jagger says, ended up in isolation, but stresses that there is no substitute for the time the band members spend together.      He added that it was difficult to say and estimate when the band could return for a world tour, postponed due to the pandemic lockdown.      "We don't know what will happen to the tour. We don't even know when the next football game is. We don't know anything," he said, regretting that many people lost their jobs, but not because they weren't doing well but because of something else.      "Many ended up jobless, and they are not to blame. The circumstances are out of control. One cannot say 'I was doing bad and I screwed up, so I have no job,'" Jagger said, adding that now people have more to worry about.      "These are difficult times, but for some, it's harder", he added.

Former Indian cricket team trainer Ramji Srinivasan feels that fitness for elite athletes is a "waste of time" if it does not translate into "world class performance" which is not possible during countrywide lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. "Fitness per se in sports is a waste of time if there is no transfer taking place on to the field to give out top class performance. Positive transfer from one to another is the key to fitness," Ramji told PTI during an interaction.
 "A person can do Olympic lift of 100 kgs at this stage, but he or she is not guaranteed to be injury free or increase in performance unless there is transfer. Bowlers do take a hit during this phase for sure. Batters not much," he added.
 Asked if long breaks can be difficult for bowlers, he said, "Oh yes for sure. Bowling is all about rhythm and skill- based fitness. There has to be a transfer from one to another. Just because someone is doing 150 kg deadlift now need not bowl quick or effectively once the match starts soon. Skill-based fitness has taken a hit for sure. More time on the nets more muscle memory is my take on it."With all sporting activity having come to a grinding halt due to the pandemic, Srinivasan, who was strength and conditioning coach of India's 2011 World Cup winning squad, said it was a testing time for sportspersons, adding they could keep themselves fit through innovative methods.
 Sportspersons are the epitome of fitness and set very high standards on fitness which percolates to the common man and motivates the entire nation to embark on fitness and wellness, he said adding this is the right time for them to motivate others through various social media platforms.
 "This is a testing time for them to work on both mentally and physically to reach the desired goal before tournaments start. Since skill set practise is out of question, what they need is to focus on fitness which is one of the key elements in performance and excellence," he added.
 "Keeping fit through innovative methods, individualised programme from their respective trainers, rehabilitation programme from their physios or injury prevention protocols can be followed. Technology helps to track their daily routine and make them adher to certain regime effectively," the CSK trainer said.
 Srinivasan, who is presently working with sportspeople including paddlers A Sharath Kamal and G Sathiyan among others, felt mental fatigue was likely to happen for sportspersons and said, "This is the time where they can focus on varied aspects of mental conditioning and physical conditioning to solve the jigsaw puzzle..."Asked what his advice would be to sportspersons at this time, he said it was important to stay positive and think out of the box and work on weaknesses and iron out problem areas.
 "...Stay positive and think out of the box to work out on the weaknesses and iron out the problems area. Now is the time to do it. Allocate time for specific activity and work on it.
 "Sportspersons always seek time with family since they always are on the move. Now is the time to relish it and enjoy to the fullest," he added.
 Srinivasan, who has also worked with the Tamil Nadu cricket team, said online advice/training was a double-edged sword.
 "It's a double-edged sword. Depends on how one uses it. Consult a professional in using online apps or platform. Something is better than nothing."This technology was not available 10 years back, Since technology is available now, making use of it is prudent. Online training has become the in-thing now and in future it will hold good for all seasons," he signed off.
