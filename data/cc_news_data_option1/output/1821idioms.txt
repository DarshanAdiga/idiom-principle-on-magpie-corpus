No, I think, James, we've been -- we haven't issued equity in over five years. I think with -- again, we've restructurally set the company up in a lot of ways. When you think about those, the 900-plus-million dollars of actions, many of them are -- I'll use the word permanent, but there's obviously sustainable. It sets us up in a really good place at the end of the day, really not to need to issue and utilize the equity markets and we weren't anticipating that anyway.

“The good news overall is we're finally ahead of this virus,” Cuomo said. “For so long we were playing catch up…We were behind it. Now, I feel for the first time, we're actually ahead of it,” he said. “We have showed that we can control the beast… we have the beast on the run, there's no doubt about that. We haven't killed the beast, but we're ahead of it,” he said.

Hey, good morning. This is James on for Jeremy. Just wanted to follow up, maybe dig deeper from Spiro's question as it pertains to the DJ. These guys seem pretty constructive at least through April on volumes there. And you mentioned the strong economics. But I guess, we're halfway through almost the second quarter, how are you seeing volumes there? And particularly with the DJ, how are you seeing production? It seems like Southern Hills was kind of getting momentum into 2Q here, but if you -- any color you can add there.

Yes. Gabe, we've actually -- we've absolutely, this is Sean, we've looked at that. We've got the 2021 and there are some out years. In the short run, we've been focused on liquidity and ensuring that the Company has liquidity. The 2021 is -- as these markets show some inefficiencies and give you the ability to pull them back at a discount, we have looked at that. That's something that we definitely keep on the plate. We haven't done it as of yet, but we are considering it. But remember, liquidity short-term current is our primary focus.

Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart has reluctantly accepted there could yet be a long-term good for the county game should the coronavirus mean there is no domestic action this season for the first time since the Second World War.
 The global outbreak of COVID-19 has seen the start of the 2020 English campaign delayed until July 1 at the earliest.
 And with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) facing a potential loss of £380 million ($471 million) if there's no cricket at all, officials have made it clear that salvaging lucrative men's internationals, albeit behind closed doors, is their priority.
 While far from happy at the prospect of a first season without county cricket since the Second World War, former England captain Stewart told the Telegraph: "If county cricket is not a cost effective exercise then I can understand why there would be opposition and the view 'why not save money and play next year?'.
 "Tough decisions have to be made for the health of individuals but (also) the health of the game.
 "Those tough financial decisions will not just be about this year but will be important for the next five years as well.
 "In financial terms county clubs are generally on the same level as division one or two football clubs and everyone will find it hard if for example it costs £30,000 a week for testing twice a week.
 "Times that by 18 counties and then that is a massive figure."
 The likes of Rory Burns, the Curran brothers and Ollie Pope have all stepped off the Surrey production belt and into the England side in recent season.
 But Stewart worries what a season without first-class cricket might mean for player development, especially if English rising stars are unable to gain overseas experience later in the year.
 "It could be another year by the time they play again. By then they may have gone 18 months without any competitive cricket," he said.
 "A lot of younger players when they first leave school will go to Australia for the winter and play grade cricket," added the 57-year-old Stewart.
 "Will Australia be letting people in? We (Britain) have the second-highest death rate in the world (from the coronavirus).
 "If you flipped it and asked would we be sending our lads to somewhere with the second-highest death rate I think there would be doubts."

For me right now I would say TAR 15. But I think I've only watched this season once and binged it in 2011. I don't think I could put a face to the winners without Googling them. I definitely think the question is personal to people based on what seasons they have watched recently and how involved they were when they watched it.      For example, TAR19 has been mentioned, but that was right around when I was an avid fan week to week and posting and discussing it, so it's very memorable to me.

_DUBNER: Okay, I don’t mean to bring you down, but then the problem is you can identify, as you did, good solutions or where it’s done well. But then you say, “Well, okay but in our situation, let’s say, where policies are entrenched and every time you want to undo something, there’s going to be a group of people over here who profit from it being done the way it’s done. So obviously it’s easier to do things well from scratch than to undo.” Do you get a little despondent when you think about problems that do have solutions but aren’t practicable?_

There’s not much Samuel “Sammy” Nilva hasn’t seen or experienced over his century-plus years.
 So, when he was hit with a confirmed case of COVID-19, he, as he has done many times before, took it in stride.
 “He’s a fighter. He has gotten through this because he is a strong person,” said daughter Barbara Nevin, a Chanhassen resident and community volunteer. “I think his doctors believe his positive outlook has kept him around as long as it has.”
 Nilva, who recently turned 101, returned to Roitenberg Family Assisted Living Residence in St. Louis Park after about a weeklong stay at the Minneapolis Veterans Medical Center.
 “We got a call when he tested positive for it, and, well, what do you think when your dad has tested positive and he’s going to be 101 in a few days? It was so hard for me,” Nevin said. “At first I was quite afraid that I wouldn’t have my dad much longer, but then you don’t get to be 101 without leading a good, healthy life.”
 Nilva’s symptoms “were pretty much minor all along,” Nevin said. “The doctor made the decision to hospitalize him to make sure this wouldn’t go into pneumonia.”
 The symptoms included low oxygen and “a bit of a fever,” Nevin said, adding that he didn’t require extensive care and could return to the assisted living facility. “They threw him a great birthday party.”
 Winning battles is nothing new for Nilva, who was born in St. Paul in 1919 during the height of the Spanish flu epidemic. He made it through World War II, the polio epidemic and had brain surgery last year to relieve swelling.
 “He always says we need to be strong because this will pass,” Nevin said. “He truly believes that; that people shouldn’t always look at the bad side of things. He believes that if any country can find a cure for this, it will be us. He has an enormous amount of faith in this country and what we can do.”
 Nilva joined the Navy but was discharged because for medical reasons. He served stateside in WWII in Washington, D.C. in the Army’s Criminal Investigation Division. Nilva, a Shriner and Mason, was state commander of the Jewish War Veterans in 1971.
 His brother, Jake Henry Nilva, was a member of the regarded Black Cat squadron. He was shot down in 1944, captured and executed. Samuel Nilva, who had other relatives in the military, put flags at veterans’ gravesites into his mid-90s.
 Nilva, who from the 1950s into the 1980s operated the St. Louis Park-based National Amusement Co., was extremely active in community and civic affairs.
 “Dad spent his life being active in veterans’ causes, in part because he lost a brother in the war,” Nevin said. “Dad lived four years not knowing what happened to his brother.”
 “He’s been through a lot; that’s for sure,” Nevin said.
 Nilva, who routinely attended Memorial Day events in Chanhassen, received a rousing send-off by his caregivers when he left the VA medical center. Nevin is certain he made a positive impression.
 “He’s an entertainer,” she said, noting that Nilva routinely sang with his wife Harriet, an opera singer and pianist. “He likes to sing and make people smile. That’s just who he is.”
 Medical center staff sang “happy birthday” to Nilva on his special day, with family members joining in via video chat before he was discharged.
 Breena Eam, a registered nurse at the veterans hospital, wrote in a Facebook post: “It’s days like today that keep our spirits up because it’s so nice to hear that there are people out there who are getting better and able to recover at home.”
 For now, Nevin, her sister Alexis Diker of Edina, and brother Jay Nilva of Inver Grove Heights, will have to wait to physically visit their father.
 “You can’t frighten my dad too much about anything,” Nevin said. “It helps to have that kind of attitude now.”
