“It’s tough, you’re here on a weekend or a holiday. They (the students) probably worked on their stuff during the holiday. It is challenging in that way; it is good for them, it spurs change in them,” FCCLA Advisor Linda Corbell said.
 Some chose projects that focus on FCCLA alone, with a primary focus on sharing the organization’s objectives, benefits and invite other high school students to join. FCCLA member Rebekah Chavez’s project focuses on the organizations achievements, and other accomplishments.
 Others chose projects that focus on their career pathways or an objective that is close to home.
 FCCLA member Sydney Gallegos chose a project in which he is able to learn hands on experience within a teaching setting, while members Dora Estrada and Adriana Hernandez worked together to create a project which would establish FCCLA at the elementary level.
 Previously, FCCLA member Carolina Sanchez shared the success of her project with the public during the 15th annual Niños Navideños.
 FCCLA member Andrea Maldonado puts her culinary skills to the test with her project and Lauren Alvarado addresses the importance of understanding autoimmune diseases.
 For many of the members, this is their second or third year competing. Yet, for FCCLA member Jose Diaz Jr., this is his first time and he chose a project focusing on interview skills.
