The Popular Front of India (PFI), which is under the scanner for alleged anti-national activities and fanning violence during the anti-CAA protests, is in the news lately after its national chairman Mohammed Abdul Salam Ovungal, 47, better known as OMA Salam, was reported to hold a state government office in Kerala.Working as a senior assistant with the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), Salam is currently posted at the Manjeri (Malappuram) SEB circle office, documents with the Hindustan Times show which was later clarified by the SEB headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram.Is it possible for a government official to be part of an outfit marred by many controversies? Senior officials of the SEB say a strict no to it, adding that nobody has made any complaints in this regard and no criminal case is pending against him, at least in Kerala. Though the SEB vigilance department had made some inquiries in this regard last year but it was dropped later. The state service rules stipulate that a government employee should not be an active member of any organisation other than the service-related recognised trade unions."There are around 36,000 employees with the state electricity board. Usually, during the joining period, there is a verification of personal details and credentials. If any case or complaints surface later, we have an internal mechanism to check it and take action against the erring," said a senior SEB official who did not want to be named.Salam joined the SEB in 2000, his records also show he made some seven foreign trips in the last six years or so under "personal trips" by seeking permission from the SEB. There are many allegations against the PFI, including one where it is alleged that it used to get regular funding from some West Asian countries - some of the foreign trips of its functionaries are also under the intelligence radar now.Salam was elected as the chairman of the PFI in February at its general assembly meet held in Puthanathani in Malappuram district. A PFI insider said he was active in the organisation since it was floated in 2006."He is working in our office. Since I joined the Manjeri department office last month I have no other details about him," said deputy chief engineer of Manjeri region P Ramani. Salam was not reachable for his comments.The PFI was launched in Kerala in 2006 after merging three Muslim outfits floated after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 - the National Development Front of Kerala, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and Manitha Neethi Pasari of Tamil Nadu. Now, the PFI claims it has units in 22 states. Majority of the PFI leaders are from Kerala and some of them are former members of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).The PFI calls itself a neo-social movement committed to empowering people belonging to the minority communities, Dalits and other weaker sections of the society. In a short span of time, it became popular among Muslim youth. "Live with pride in India" is its guiding principle. On the lines of the RSS, the PFI has uniforms and often conducts drills at public places. In 2013, the Kerala government had banned its freedom parade - which it conducts on the Independence Day - after the police found its cadres were carrying stars and emblems on the uniform.Every year on February 17, it conducts unity marches at all its district headquarters. It has cadre training centres in many districts and usually associates with many human rights organizations to get a sombre outlook, police officials said. It's religious school 'Sathya Sarani' in Manjeri was in the news after parents of some Hindu and Christian girls alleged that it was a conversion hub. Akhila Ashokan alias Hadiya Jehan, a dentist who embraced Islam and later married a Muslim youth, was reportedly converted here.In Kerala, the PFI was mired in many clashes and political murders. It was allegedly involved in at least 30 political murders in the past decade. In 2015, 13 of its workers were awarded life-term for chopping the palm of a college professor, TJ Joseph, who prepared a question paper which was alleged to be blasphemous. Two years ago, six PFI activists were held in connection with the murder of an ABVP leader in Kannur and nine were arrested for allegedly killing SFI leader Abhimanyu at Maharajas College in Ernakulam. After last year's protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act turned violent in many parts of the country, there was a demand to ban the organisation.

Ever since the world started pointing fingers at Beijing for the spread of coronavirus, Pakistan has gone out of its way to express solidarity with China. Even to the extent of refusing to let its 1,000-odd students stranded in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, return to Islamabad in February. It is no secret that Beijing had been soliciting support from all its friends, or clients, as some analysts describe the relationship between China and Pakistan. Islamabad, indebted to China for more than one reason, had gone a step further. China was being panned by countries across the world, particularly the United States, over what was widely-perceived to be Beijing's gross negligence, which led to the spread of the disease that has infected 11 million people across the world and killed nearly 530,000.In the cacophony that followed as countries took sides, Pakistan was understandably the loudest voice in support of China despite some uneasiness in foreign policy circles of Islamabad.Before the world was able to visualise the impact of the pandemic, Pakistan was in a comfortable position on the foreign policy front, particularly the China-US matrix. It was effectively leveraging its influence over the Taliban to extract concessions from the US in the global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force. Washington was soft pedalling on Pakistan's failure to comply with the FATF Action Plan and had allowed it extra time at the Paris Plenary in February. The reprieve, by any standards, was a fair indicator of the Pakistan Foreign Office's successful handling of a tricky situation.Much of this effort by Pakistani diplomats to navigate the sensitivities in Washington appeared to come undone as the Pakistani establishment rushed to comply with signals from Beijing that wanted Prime Minister Imran Khan's government to continue to back them up. The worldly-wise officials at the Foreign Office and, some at the Prime Minister's Office, were the first ones to spot the change in Washington's approach. The officials, including the US-educated Special Advisor on National Security Moeed Yusuf and British-educated Zulfi Bukhari, realised the impossibility of balancing relations with Washington and Beijing in the face of the establishment's inflexible and decades-old mindset characterised by suspiciousness of the West.The Pakistan military's tunnel vision and stranglehold over key foreign policy aspects have prevented the country from benefiting from the available expertise at home and evolving a pragmatic and non-confrontational foreign policy. At a time when world opinion is sharply against Beijing, Pakistan has chosen to be the devil's advocate.Like when Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi put out a statement on his phone conversation with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the foreign ministry had to make a pointed reference to underline Pakistan's commitment to the "One-China policy" and express support to China on its "core interests including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang".In Pakistan, the army has been in a pivotal position irrespective of the regime in power. It also, maybe, doesn't have anything to lose if Pakistan is again clubbed with the likes of North Korea. In fact, it has been argued by its critics that the army's clout over politics and civilian life tends to proportionately increase with Pakistan's marginalisation, as does the access to material riches for its leadership.The army was the biggest beneficiary of the billions that the United States poured into Pakistan in the name of support for the war on terror.When that well seemed to be drying up, it found a willing donor in Beijing for whom the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor became a flagship project for its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. It could also lead Pakistan into a debt trap.Thousands of Pakistanis paid with their lives for the establishment's shortsighted strategy of arming and nurturing terrorists and turning terror into an instrument of foreign policy.What woes the new strategy of trying to milk China and the CPEC will bring to the Pakistanis, only time will tell. The more erudite officials of the Foreign Office can visualise the implications for Pakistan, such as the heightened possibility of graduating to the FATF blacklist if it does not deliver on its action plan.

A hamstring injury for N'Golo Kante took some of the gloss off Chelsea's impressive 3-0 win over Watford on Saturday. Kante picked up the injury in the second half at Stamford Bridge -- a potential blow in Chelsea's battle to seal a top-four finish in the Premier League. The fixtures are coming thick and fast for Chelsea with Crystal Palace, Sheffield United and Norwich City in their next three league fixtures before Manchester United in the FA Cup."He's got a small hamstring injury so we will see how that goes," Chelsea manager Frank Lampard said of the French midfielder."Hopefully it is not too bad but it comes with the territory of this tight restart and tight run of games."A lack of pre-season and we have to rely on the squad. There will be players that come in and can perform for us as well. But it is the same for everybody."After a 3-2 defeat at West Ham United in midweek, Lampard praised the way his team responded with goals from Olivier Giroud, Willian and Ross Barkley sealing the points."Today, there was a bit of pressure to get back to fourth and we produced, so get used to that pressure -- whatever way it looks -- because it's going to be tough all the way through," Lampard said.

President Donald Trump, yet again, hailed the United States’ coronavirus testing as COVID-19 cases in the country increased by more than 55,000 on Thursday, a new daily global record for the pandemic.
 A surge in coronavirus cases over the past week has put Trump’s handling of the crisis under the microscope and led several governors to halt plans to reopen their states after strict lockdowns.
 “There is a rise in Coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good, far bigger and better than any other country,” Trump said in a tweet late on Thursday.
 “This is great news, but even better news is that death, and the death rate, is down,” he said.
 The daily U.S. tally of cases stood at 55,274 late on Thursday, topping the previous single-day record of 54,771 set by Brazil on June 19.
 The wave of new cases has several governors halting or back-pedaling on plans to reopen their states after months of strict lockdowns, closing beaches and canceling fireworks displays over the upcoming Independence Day weekend.
 The United States has now recorded nearly 129,000 deaths from the outbreak, nearly a quarter of the known global total.
