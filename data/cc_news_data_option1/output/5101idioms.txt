 This is a classic quiche with a lovely, creamy filling. If you must add cheese, sprinkle a little grated Gruyere on top right before it goes into the oven. Use your own homemade pastry for the crust, or use a premade or frozen crust. If using frozen, precook for 10 minutes before adding the filling.
 JULIA CHILD'S QUICHE LORRAINE   • 6 to 8 slices lean bacon cut into 1-inch pieces   • 8-inch partially cooked pastry shell   • 3 eggs   • 1 to 2 cups heavy cream   • 1 teaspoon salt   • Pinch of pepper   • Pinch of nutmeg   • 1 to 2 tablespoons butter cut into pea-sized dots
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
 Put bacon in a medium pan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 5 minutes, then drain. Return bacon to the pan and cook over medium heat until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Transfer bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel to drain. Add the bacon evenly to the crust's bottom.
 Beat eggs, cream and salt together in a medium bowl, and season to taste with nutmeg and pepper. Pour mixture into crust and sprinkle butter over the top. Bake until custard is puffed and golden and just set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve quiche warm or at room temperature, sliced into wedges.   BACON AND CHEDDAR GRITS QUICHE   This dish will be the showstopper on your brunch table. The crust consists of cheesy grits, a layer of cheese and is topped with an egg mixture that is more like a creamy custard.

 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove bacon, drain and crumble. Transfer 2 teaspoons bacon drippings a saucepan.

Remove from heat; let stand 10 minutes. Stir in 1 cup cheese. Let stand 10 minutes. Stir in 1 egg. Spread in a 9-inch springform pan that has been lightly coated with cooking spray.
 Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until set and browned. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup of cheese over warm grits, spreading to edges. Let stand for 15 minutes. At this point, you can refrigerate overnight if you'd like.
 Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Combine half and half, cream, onions, remaining 5 eggs, 1 teaspoon salt and teaspoon pepper. Pour over grits. Sprinkle with crumbled bacon and then place the pan on a foil-lined baking sheet.
 Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour, or until lightly browned and just set. Let stand 20 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the edges of quiche. Carefully remove sides of the pan. Garnish with chopped chives if desired.   \- From Southern Living, December 2014   Laura Tolbert, also known as Fleur de Lolly, has been sharing recipes, table decor ideas and advice for fellow foodies and novices on her blog, fleurdelolly.blogspot.com for more than eight years.

Skeptics believing a Middle East nuclear arms race is many years down the road fail to realize Riyadh can join the race almost instantaneously. Having helped Pakistan fund its nuclear defenses for years, Saudi Arabia did so with a tacit understanding that if it needed such weapons from Islamabad, they would be provided. Since Iran continues to be firmly committed to knocking Saudi Arabia off its pedestal as custodian of Islam’s Two Holy Cities, to establishing a Shia caliphate as the leader of the Islamic world, and to triggering the return of the “Hidden Imam” – all goals pointing to a nuclear attack on Saudi Arabia – Riyadh will quickly press Pakistan to make good on their understanding.

 Authorities say Rahman, then an employee of the Walmart in Nixa, had placed a device that looked like a bomb on a shelf in a stockroom at the back of the store.
 A coworker found the object, called 911 and the store was evacuated as the Springfield Fire Department Bomb Squad was called out to investigate and determine the device was not explosive.
 Rahman, 36, was facing a possible 4-year prison sentence when investigators determined he was the one who placed the object on the shelf.
 But last week, Christian County prosecutors dropped the felony charge against Rahman in exchange for him pleading guilty to misdemeanor property damage and agreeing to two years of unsupervised probation.
 Rahman's crime, according to court documents: causing some food to spoil when the building was suddenly evacuated.
 By allowing Rahman to plead guilty to a Class B misdemeanor, prosecutors seem to be signaling there was no malicious intent on Rahman's part when he placed the object on the shelf.
 Court documents indicate Rahman was ordered to pay $1,800 in restitution as part of the plea deal.
 Rahman was given a suspended imposition of sentence, meaning if he successfully completes probation then he will not have a conviction on his record.
 Attempts to reach Rahman's attorney for comment were not successful.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A week after announcing a record-shattering 2,470 COVID-19 cases in one day, South Carolina health officials said Friday the state had eclipsed that figure by several hundred. The Department of Health and Environmental Control reported 3,137 confirmed cases and 47 additional deaths Friday. More than 220,000 cases have been recorded in the state since the beginning of the outbreak, and 4,332 South Carolinians have died due to COVID-19, according to the health agency. The rising numbers come as the state lays out its plan to vaccinate frontline healthcare workers and then eventually the rest of the population. Officials say that with limited supplies, the vaccine isn't an immediate solution. “While the arriving vaccine is the light at the end of the tunnel, it will be months before there is enough vaccine available for everyone,\" said a statement from Brannon Traxler, the state's interim public health director. \"It is incumbent upon all of us to continue to take actions aimed at saving lives.” Top state health and hospital officials have said case and hospital numbers are returning to levels not seen since the state’s last spike over the summer. The past week has also seen 7.7% of all COVID-19 cases in South Carolina since the pandemic began in early March -- 17,266 cases since last Friday. As they have done for months, the health experts also pleaded with South Carolinians to help reduce the spread of the virus by measures such as wearing a face mask, practicing social distancing and getting tested when sick. Gov.

"The Falcons kept the game close despite another good game from the Saints' defense," Patra writes. "ATL struggled to get going early, with two three-and- outs to open the contest. New Orleans then forced a trio of field goals in the first half. The inability of Matt Ryan and Co. to turn FGs into TDs was the difference Sunday. A fourth-quarter touchdown broke a streak of 42 straight drives without allowing a TD by the Saints defense. Ryan did a better job getting the ball out against New Orleans than the previous loss, only being sacked three times -- five fewer than Week 11. Julio Jones (6/94) made some ridiculous catches and Calvin Ridley (5/108) added explosion as the Falcons stayed in the game into the fourth quarter despite going 5-of-13 on third downs. There are no moral victories in the NFC South rivalry, so having a shot late to pull the upset won't bring smiles to Atlanta. The Falcons going 1-of-4 in the red zone was the difference in the contest. The red area has been Atlanta's bugaboo all year, and it was no different against a good Saints D Sunday."

He won me over with _Cop Land_ all the way back in 1997. Since, he's directed _Walk the Line_ (2005), _3:10 to Yuma_ (2007), _Logan_ (2017), and _Ford v Ferrari_ (2019) -- all great movies.

Border Caravan Storage, a family run business that offers storage for 170 caravans, motor homes and trailers has been operated by Keith, Alison and Helen Rogers for over 15 years. The site used an access control system to control access to the site, but there wasn't an ideal method of tracking which units were on site, at any given time. The management team had been using a manually operated display board that was prone to error, so they decided to look for a reliable automatic method of identifying which units were on site. Airlock system with uPASS long-range reader The Border management team spoke to Paul Evans of BTT Comms (ex MMV), who suggested using Nortech's airlock system, where vehicles have to pass through two separate electronically controlled gates to enter or exit the site. The existing drivers' access control fobs are used alongside uPASS tags, which are placed in the side window of the caravans for detection by the uPASS long-range reader. The system has been recognised by CaSSOA, who endorse the system giving the highest level of security possible If a caravan passes through the first gate, the second gate will only open if the uPASS tag and the driver's fob are both detected and provide a valid match. The information is also relayed to a specially designed asset management system that keeps a real-time log of all units on and off the site. High level of access control security This system has been recognised by CaSSOA, the Caravan Storage Owners' Association, who endorse the system giving the highest level of security possible, which is recognised by insurance companies, thereby reducing insurance costs for caravan owners. Benefits Simple and reliable means of monitoring the movement of caravans on and off the site. Reliable long-range tag detection avoids manual intervention and reduces running costs. Enhanced security reduces insurance costs for caravan owners. Helen Rogers of Border Caravan Storage stated, "We are very pleased with the new system which provides information in real time and we now know which caravans and owners are on site at any time giving us total peace of mind."
