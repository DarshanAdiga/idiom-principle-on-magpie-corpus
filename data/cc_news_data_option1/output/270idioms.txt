Considering the demands of a growing Montana population, annual sessions would benefit our state. When addressing such issues as highway fatalities, the drunk driving epidemic, education, public and private land issues, fish and game needs, homelessness, immigration, taxes, the economy and many other current issues, we should seriously consider annual sessions for the state of Montana. We are often behind the curve when dealing with issues that come down from the federal government. The results can tie the hands of the state legislators, and ultimately, the citizens of Montana are the big losers.
 Most Montanans donâ€™t want professional legislators, but our current system leaves the people of Montana with limited opportunities for input into what influences their lives. Therefore, we wish to salute the state legislators for meeting this month in Helena to begin the process to consider annual sessions in Montana. We support the decision to place the question on the ballot for the people to decide. For in Montana, in fact all of America, the people are with whom such decisions should be made.

Good, good. I just want to make sure I understand the expense opportunities on slide 22. And Jim, I think you said this, but I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear. All the -- if we look at the walk to $5 million, $7 million, $9 million throughout 2020 and then the $40 million in full year 2021 benefits, those are all expenses, which are net of revenue opportunities. Right. So that's all, in other words, anticipated to drop to the bottom line. Is that the right way of looking at it?
