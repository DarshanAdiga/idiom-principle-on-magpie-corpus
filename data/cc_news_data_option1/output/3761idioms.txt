"articleBody" : "Many sandalwood actors have showcased their talent in their craft and gone on to become famous in other film industries. Prakash Raj, Rajinikanth, B. Saroja Devi, Rashmika Madanna, Kokila Mohan, and Rakshitha are examples to name a few. Now, it appears it is the turn of Upendra who is being cast in many Telugu movies.The actor has a huge fan following in Tollywood too after he was seen in several Telugu movies, some straight Telugu movie and others dubbed versions of his Kannada movies. But guess what? The actor will be next working with none other than a young atcor from the Megastar family. By now, you must have guessed who we are talking about. Yes. it is Varun Tej. This news has put Uppi fans on cloud nine and his following too has seen a swell in numbers.Now, wheh we talk about fans it's not just the moviebuff we are talking about. Let us tell you Upendra has fans even among Telugu actors. We hear that Telugu actor Sampoornesh Babu who is commonly known as the Burning Star of Tollywood is a huge fan of Sandalwood Real Star Upendra.Sampoo, as he is fondly called by people in the industry, is known for his own style of expressions in his movies and has a huge fan base himself in the Telugu film industry.The news about Sampoo looking up to Upendra was revealed by none other than the actor himself on his Facebook while greeting Upendra on his birthday. Inspite of being a Telugu actor, Sampoorneshgreeted the sandalwood actor in kannada on his FB.Together with posting a photo of himself with the Sandalwood star, the actor stated 'The actor who became an inspiration for me to become a lead actor, my most favourite actor. My hearty greetings on his birthday,' posted the Telugu Burning Star on his Facebook wall.Sampoornesh is famously known for his acting skills and his choice of movies are way different from the rest. He picks famous scenes from hit movies and portrays them in a satirical way or with extreme expressions. As a result, Sampoo occasionally also draws the wrath of many lead actors. But yet, he is one of the famous comedy actors in Telugu who has a huge fan following.It is good to see people looking for inspiration outside their own industry. In this case a Tollywood actor getting inspired by a Sandalwood hero. Here's a look at what Sampoornesh Babu posted on his Facebook on the occasion of Uppi's birthday ",

After months of harassment and racist remarks, the doctor at the centre of a COVID-19 controversy that rocked New Brunswick says his life has been changed entirely.
 Dr. Jean Robert Ngola, a physician of Congolese descent, said in a recent interview the fallout from allegations he was "patient zero" responsible for an outbreak put him under an uncomfortable spotlight.
 "Since May ... everything has changed in my life," Ngola said by phone.
 And now he wants the province to investigate his case to ensure nobody else endures a similar fate.
 On May 27, in the face of a growing outbreak in Campbellton, N.B., Premier Blaine Higgs referred to an "irresponsible" health-care worker and said the matter was being handled by the RCMP. The outbreak eventually affected 40 people and resulted in two deaths.
 News got out that Ngola, a family doctor working in the northern New Brunswick town at the time, was the suspect in the RCMP's investigation after his positive COVID-19 status was leaked on social media.
 Ngola says a deluge of harassment and racist taunts followed, both online and in person, as the investigation unfolded into an overnight trip he took to Quebec.
 Before he tested positive, Ngola had driven to Montreal to pick up his daughter, because her mother was travelling to Africa to attend a funeral.
 On his way back to New Brunswick, he met with two colleagues in the Trois- Rivieres, Que., area before completing his trip, according to his lawyer, Joel Etienne. He did not self-isolate for two weeks when he returned, as provincial health guidelines direct, but Ngola has said that was consistent with the practice of other physicians at his hospital.
 After it was revealed that Ngola was the health worker being investigated, he was suspended from his job at the hospital in Campbellton. Ngola said he had to disconnect his phone because people were harassing him, telling him to "go back to Africa" and calling him a "refugee."
 Although he had already been planning to move to Quebec, Ngola hastened his departure because he didn't feel safe in Campbellton, he said.
 "I was one of the good physicians, I think, in this small city. Everybody knew me in Campbellton," he said. "But in my own city, I cannot work. Even now I cannot go to my house."
 Recently, however, he has been heartened after receiving a letter of support from fellow doctors in Canada. It was a sign, he said, that he "wasn't alone" as he continued to deal with the allegations against him. Though the RCMP investigation was dropped, Ngola still faces a charge of violating the province's Emergency Measures Act and has a court date Oct. 26.
 "It was so emotional," Ngola said of the letter. "My tears flowed."

One of the key players nationally in aviation is Cork-based Atlantic Flight Training Academy (www.afta.ie). Led by Captain Mark Casey, the group is a well established, and well-regarded academy for initial training for pilots where 2100 pilots have trained in the last 25 Years. The real-world weather conditions in Cork offers a popular contrast to international bases such as Florida and Spain where flight training is less representative of variable flying conditions. In 2018, AFTA and CIT collaborated on the development of the aviation degree and have continued to work together to ensure that Cork’s contribution to aviation is well understood and acknowledged. Capt Casey says “the development of the degree programme has been transformational for both flight school graduates and experienced professional pilots that do not have the flexibility to attend full time tuition, or scheduled lectures, due to time zone synchronisation and rotating roster barriers. CIT embraced the multiple challenges that this presented to the individual from the ‘get-go’ and have developed and successfully delivered a world class product for the industry. A continuous impetus to enhance and develop the programme by the team at CIT has been the driving force behind the success of the aviation degree course .While the utilisation of online tools and blended learning has become the norm over the past 6 months for all the wrong reasons, CIT have had a 2 year lead in this arena and they should be applauded for being global frontrunners in this field. AFTA's airline partners, Ryanair and Stobart Air, have also continuously helped to promote the opportunity to their Captains and First officers ”. The programme was also supported by the Aviation SKillnet.

 Srikakulam Collector J. Nivas and IRCS chairman P. Jaganmohana Rao urged NGOs to give wide publicity about ₹5,000 cash incentive for plasma donors. Along with Rotary Club and Lions Club, Pradhama Hospital-Visakapatnam has launched awareness programme in Srikakulam, Parvatipuram, Bobbili of Vizianagaram district over plasma donation. The hospital representatives interacted with patients and their family members about the saving of precious lives with plasma donation.
 “Many patients have little knowledge about functioning of blood. For every 120 days the body generates new blood cells, while the ones die. The same is applicable for plasma also. That is why, we are asking patients not to wait for donation of plasma only to their family members and friends. They can help others who in turn help their dear ones if necessary. Fortunately, our awareness programmes in the two districts have yielded the desired result. Many patients enrolled their names for plasma donation,” said Pusarla Visweswara Rao, Managing Director of Pradhama Hospital.
 ## ‘Only option at present’
 Physician Kutikuppala Suryarao said that convalescent plasma treatment was the only option currently available to save patients. “ Convalescent plasma therapy has been in vogue for the last 100 years to save patients affected by infections. Although ICMR and other institutions expressed doubts about 100% result, we need to depend on it till vaccine is ready for COVID-19,” said Dr. Surya Rao.

The goal this year seems to be finding a more balanced approach on offense and not be so heavily reliant on explosive plays. Andy Reid thinks that Patrick Mahomes can be the best version of himself when he doesn’t have to be Superman each week. That’s not to say they don’t want him improvising and doing the things that make him a special talent, they just don’t want it to all fall on him.They added some pieces in LG Kelechi Osemele and RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire that give the run game the type of pizzazz that it hasn’t seen since early in the 2018 season before the Kareem Hunt situation. Also, Mahomes has said that he wants to do a better job taking what the defense gives him. That means recognizing when the shot play will be there, but also feeling comfortable checking it down to his army of playmakers.

I would say you’re spot on with the linebacker group, they’re easily the worst unit on this team. The three starters in Anthony Hitchens, Damien Wilson and Ben Niemann were the three lowest-graded defenders for the Chiefs in Week 1 according to PFF. The only good news out of that group is the 2018 third-round draft pick Dorian O’Daniel finally made an appearance and played well. As for the secondary, they were actually really impressive in Week 1. Rookie CB L’Jarius Sneed was the standout as he had a pair of passes defended and an interception. In garbage time the defense let up a couple of touchdowns. Tyrann Mathieu set the tone after the game, saying that he was, “pissed off.” Really, everyone echoed that sentiment this week in practice, so I’d expect a better performance through four quarters. Rashad Fenton will be starting opposite Sneed, you might remember him from the Mexico City game last year as he had a big interception in that game.
