The Lancers thumped Tillamook 35-7 for the title in ’77, then added a dubious co-championship in 1981, a 0-0 tie with Siuslaw at Autzen Stadium in Eugene.
 In fact, Wigle had a hand in two of the lowest scoring playoff games in Oregon history, both against Siuslaw and head coach Len Lutero. The first came in 1975.
 During the week leading up to the Class AA playoffs, the grandstands at the Myrtle Creek field burned down. The game was moved to Roseburg’s Finlay Field, which by game time had been turned into a mud bog. South Umpqua got an early field goal from Will Petterson. Later, the Lancers were pinned deep in their own end and took a safety, then got a monster punt from Brian Bucheit, leaving Siuslaw to navigate nearly 90 yards with time running out. The Lancers claimed the 3-2 win.
 “What an ugly night,” Wigle recalled. “There were some people saying we’d been over-watering the field, but the thing was, it wasn’t our field.”
 By the late ’80s, South Umpqua’s enrollment numbers were dwindling, as were players coming out for football. After the 1987 season, Wigle and his wife Susan were contemplating a change. Then the Marshfield job came open.
 In Coos Bay, Wigle took over one of the smallest programs in the big-school division and went on a run for the ages.
 Starting in 1988, Wigle’s Pirates reached the state playoffs 18 times in 21 seasons, beating Ashland 36-21 in the 1992 Class 4A state championship game. There were a handful of clashes with his friend Bell’s Roseburg squad in that time.
 From 1994-99, the Pirates went 10-0 six consecutive seasons and amassed a then-record 55 consecutive regular-season wins.
 In 2005, he was selected as the National Federation of High School Associations football coach of the year. In 2008, his name was added to the marquee at Marshfield’s Pete Susick Stadium. Also on the dedication board: Steve Prefontaine Track.
 Wigle retired after the 2008 season, ending a career of nearly four decades and 300-plus wins. He also coached 13 times in the East-West Shrine Game and Les Schwab Bowl.
 Today, he and Susan have been married 45 years. He’s an avid golfer, carrying “about an 11 or 12” handicap. He gets plenty of laps in on the five courses at Bandon Dunes and recently carded an 80 in the club championship at Coos Country Club.
 He still misses football. Not for the wear and tear on his body — there is a knee replacement scheduled for December — but for the relationships.
 “I don’t miss the other stuff you have to walk through, but the relationships with the coaches, the athletes, the managers. All of that I thoroughly enjoyed,” Wigle said. “I’ve had a very fortunate life from that standpoint.”

Lockley said the sign was designed partly by Public Works Director Alice Barnes, who worked with multiple people in her department to develop the special design.
 McComb Branch NAACP President Mamie Kettle also attended the unveiling.

If Arizona slips away, Trump campaign officials privately acknowledge that it would complicate his path to 270 electoral votes. If he loses Arizona, winning Wisconsin — the most likely Midwest state for Trump to retain — would not be enough even if he keeps Florida and North Carolina. It would require him to win somewhere else, which has led to a renewed focus on Minnesota, New Hampshire and the at-large congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine.
 Nevada has become a particular focus, in part because Las Vegas is an appetizing location for Trump to raise money. He scheduled at least one high- dollar fundraiser there over the weekend — as well as one in Washington before he flies west — as he looks to assuage growing concerns that he could fall short of cash. Couples were asked for $150,000 for the Las Vegas fundraiser.
 The Republican National Committee said the $18 million expected to be raised over the weekend, including from a stop Saturday at his hotel in Washington, would be shared by Trump’s campaign, the committee and several state GOP committees.
 Trump and Republicans raised $210 million in August, a robust sum but far behind the record $364.5 million taken in by Biden and his party that month. Though the Trump campaign has insisted that it has more resources on hand than it did at this time in 2016, whispers about a financial disadvantage led Trump himself this past week to suggest he may put some of his own fortune into the race.
 Nevada’s financial health is dependent on the national economy doing well because the state draws so much revenue from tourism. When the pandemic hit, Nevada’s casinos and all gambling shuttered for about 11 weeks, and the state is trimming about one-quarter of its budget at a time of sky-high unemployment.

 # Jack Nicklaus, golf legends steal the show at Sanford International
 Matt Zimmer
 Sioux Falls Argus Leader
 If you attended the second day of the Sanford International at Minnehaha Country Club (and the improved weather resulted in a far larger crowd Saturday than for Friday’s opener), you might have found yourself with a difficult decision by the end of the afternoon.
 Who to follow around the course?
 You had the threesome of Steve Stricker, John Daly and Robin Byrd, with Daly clearly asserting himself as the people’s choice after this week’s bladder cancer diagnosis, which he’s promptly responded to with a stellar first two days, checking in at 6-under, three strokes off the lead heading into Sunday.
 Stricker, the 2018 champion, shot a 64 Saturday to vault himself into a tie for the lead at 9-under.
 Or you could’ve followed the threesome of Miguel Angel Jimenez, David Toms and Dicky Pride, who are all playing spectacular golf this weekend. Pride shot a 5-under 65 on Friday to take the early lead, while Jimenez produced a second straight brilliant round that puts him atop the leaderboard with Stricker at 9-under. Toms is not far behind at 7-under.
 Then there was Darren Clarke, who carded a tournament-record 62 on Saturday to pull within one stroke of Stricker, tied with Kevin Sutherland and Fred Couples, who shot a 64 on Saturday, including the shot of the day when he eagled No. 9 with a "slam dunk" chip directly into the hole.
 And still, with all that going on, it was hard for the spectators not to turn their attention to the back nine at around 4 p.m., when the Legends Series teed off for their nine-hole charity exhibition.
 Jack Nicklaus and Andy North took on Hale Irwin and Tony Jacklin. Nicklaus, considered by many to be the greatest golfer of all time, teaming with the two-time U.S. Open winner, and Irwin, the winningest player in PGA Tour Champions history teaming with Jacklin, a British legend and 1970 U.S. Open champion.
 Nicklaus is 80, Jacklin 76 and Irwin 75, while North was the young pup of the group at 70, and the foursome put on a memorable show that left onlookers in awe throughout their 2½ hour round.
 Jacklin and Irwin ended up winning the match play event, their prize being $20,000 to Sanford Children’s Hospital. It dropped North and Nicklaus to 0-3 in the event, a number they were having fun with in a group media session before the round and continued to joke about throughout their trip through Minnehaha’s back nine.
 But while fun, camaraderie and charity were clearly the top priorities for the foursome, the exhibition of golf they put on, even in their 70s and beyond, was impressive in its own right.
 Nicklaus, who won a battle with COVID-19 earlier this year, doesn’t move very quickly and his swing is an abbreviated version of itself, and that limited his distance off the tee. But the Golden Bear still put virtually every drive right down the middle, and saw a handful of difficult putts just miss giving the throng of fans that surrounded the greens the chance to erupt in celebration (as they so clearly wanted to).
 Irwin, who was an all-Big 8 defensive back for the Colorado Buffaloes and later a three-time U.S. Open winner, looks about a dozen years younger than his 75 years and spent his round ribbing the other golfers, chatting with fans and media and making friends with Ben Wieman, the 10-year-old from Madison who was named the Sandford Children’s Hospital Ambassador.
 Wieman had been diagnosed with leukemia in 2017 and rang the ball at the Children’s Hospital on April 10 to mark the end of his cancer treatment. North had Wieman take his final putt on No. 18, and the youngster’s presence was extra special when the Legends finished their round and the gift to the Children’s Hospital was made official.
 “I think it’s one of the highlights of the week to get three of the greatest players to ever play this game to come in here and spend nine holes having some fun and some laughs and get a chance to compete at whatever level we can compete now,” said North, who nearly chipped one in from 20 yards outside the green on No. 12. “We really do appreciate it.”

The Jamaican production was a word of mouth hit in the U.S. and the soundtrack, often ranked among the greatest in movie history, included the Maytals’ “Pressure Drop” and “Sweet and Dandy.” Hibbert also appeared in the film, as himself, recording “Sweet and Dandy” in the studio while Cliff's character looks on with awe. Around the same time, the Maytals signed with Island Records and released the acclaimed album “Funky Kingston,” which the critic Lester Bangs called “the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released.” (The album would eventually come out in two different versions).

Lompoc Unified is holding off on welcoming students back to their classrooms out of caution in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
 In a statement Wednesday, the school district announced it will not be applying for a waiver to reopen schools.
 The district said the decision was made along with the Lompoc Federation of Teachers (LFT), adding that both agree it’s “far better to operate with an abundance of caution moving forward than it is to put the health and well- being of our community at risk.”
 The decision was not made lightly, the district said, adding, “We have heard from countless teachers, parents, and students about the difficulties that come with distance learning. We hear and, more often than not, share these concerns. However, as long as we are in the midst of this pandemic, our first priority is, and will continue to be, the health and safety of our students, staff, and community.”
 They say this move will be reconsidered once the number of confirmed coronavirus cases begins to drop in Santa Barbara County.
 Santa Barbara County remains in the highest COVID-19 tier in the state along with many other counties, meaning many non-essential indoor business operations are closed.
 The county reported 51 new cases on Wednesday bringing the county's total to 8,550 confirmed cases as of September 9.
 Santa Barbara County gave the green light in August for schools to apply for waivers that would allow for in-person instruction.
 Health officials announced last week that some waivers had already been approved.

Her departure could complicate the final stretch of an investigation already slowed by the coronavirus pandemic but eagerly anticipated by President Donald Trump and his supporters to uncover what they see as wrongdoing within the FBI during the Russia investigation. It leaves the investigative team without one of its veteran prosecutors as key decisions presumably await before the probe wraps up.
 Durham’s appointment by Attorney General William Barr was made public soon after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report into Russian election interference. In the year and a half since, he has questioned former law enforcement and intelligence officials — former CIA Director John Brennan among them — about decisions made during the course of the Russia probe. Dannehy had been a top leader on the team, present for interviews with such officials, including Brennan.
 The investigation has not yet produced the results that Trump supporters had been hoping for. There is also pressure to wrap up soon given that Justice Department policy frowns on investigative steps that could affect an election, though Barr has said that policy would not apply here since Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is not a target of the probe. It’s also not clear that Durham’s work would be permitted to continue if Trump loses in November and Democratic leadership assumes control at the Justice Department.
 Trump himself has indicated that he wants results soon, saying at a White House press conference on Thursday that Durham was a “very, very respected man” and that his work would involve a “report or maybe it’s much more than that.”
 The investigation has produced one criminal charge so far, against a former FBI lawyer accused of altering an email related to the surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide. But that prosecution did not allege a broader conspiracy within the FBI, and the conduct it involved had largely been laid out in a Justice Department inspector general report from last December.
 It is not clear if Durham will be able to conclude his work before the election, though Barr has not ruled out the possibility of additional criminal charges.
 In other developments related to the Russia investigation, lawyers connected to the case of former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn were submitting arguments Friday about how the prosecution should proceed in light of an appeals court ruling last week.
 The court ruled that U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan did not have to dismiss the case just because the Justice Department wanted him to. The ruling opened the door for Sullivan to scrutinize the basis for the department’s unusual request, which came even though Flynn had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.
 John Gleeson, the retired federal judge who was appointed by Sullivan to argue against the Justice Department’s position, said in a filing that the case should not be dismissed and called the government’s motion to dismiss “plainly a corrupt political errand for the President.”
 “There is clear evidence that the Government’s Motion to Dismiss the case against Defendant Michael T. Flynn rests on pure pretext,” Gleeson wrote. “There is clear evidence that this motion reflects a corrupt and politically motivated favor unworthy of our justice system.”
 Flynn pleaded guilty as part of the Mueller probe to lying about conversations during the presidential transition in which he urged the then-Russian ambassador to not escalate tensions in response to sanctions that had just been imposed for interference in the 2016 election.
 At the time, the FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russia to swing the election, and White House officials were stating publicly that Flynn and the diplomat had not discussed sanctions.
 The Justice Department sought to dismiss the case in May, arguing that the FBI didn’t have good reason to interview Flynn in the first place and that any false statements he may have made during questioning were not material to the probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The spending was funded after the takeover of Roman Abramovich, who transformed the club overnight into one which could compete to win the Premier League and Champions League.
 Lampard came in before Abramovich in a move from West Ham in 2001. He then had to fight to maintain his standing in the squad following those transfers and he hopes that, having given eight academy players debuts last season, they will step up as he did.
 “Claudio Ranieri said nothing that I remember, to be honest," Lampard told reporters on Zoom. "In these things, the manager has choices to say things to players. I get that more than ever now I am in that job.
 “Sometimes you feel fit to speak to players depending on their personality, other times not. With me I just saw it as a challenge. I referenced that before that when players come in to add to the squad, they might be in similar positions to you or not, but it lifts the team.
 "It should lift the team. The players with the right mentality will up their game, make friends with the player, make them feel welcome and try to work within the squad as well as they can with them. Hopefully, you see levels raised throughout the squad.
 “I think that is something that did occur in those times. I was a young player, so was John (Terry), so were others in the group and I think that the core of young players in that group did react and we managed to form a good group going forward.
 "I expect them to be excited by the challenge of playing in this squad this year. I think we are searching for a story here. I don’t see it in those direct, competitive situations that we are trying to find.
 “In a modern-day squad, much more than 17 years ago when we were talking about before, needs to have flexibility, needs to have competition. I don’t think we need to find direct battles at this point of the season, no.
 “The team needs to be flexible. A lot of the time I am talking about players who can play in a variety of different positions, which is always great for the manager. I just see it as a group which is hopefully stronger than last year. And the players try to give everything for the team game after game.
 The six deals have seen Chelsea bring in Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen, Timo Werner from RB Leipzig, Hakim Ziyech from Ajax, Thiago Silva from PSG and Malang Sarr from Nice.
 That led Lampard to discuss that his selections won't necessarily be based on how much a player costs but that he feels the signings will lift the quality of his options.
 "I am not silly; we bring in players to improve the team to the level we feel we brought in," he added. "Then you want them to play games.
 "You brought them in to improve so you want them to play regular games but there is never a point where you actually start siding with players over either how long they have been here or how much they cost.
 "Those are not the rules and nobody would expect that. We just try and create a way to have players training at such a level to give us a high level of performance. That’s a daily battle for all of us."
 With Mateo Kovacic suspended ahead of Monday's opening match against Brighton, Mason Mount is likely to start but reports in Germany had stated that he had grown frustrated over the club's decision to sign Havertz this summer.

Werner, however, was seemingly convinced to join the Blues when Lampard and Petr Cech personally went to meet the attacker earlier this year for face-to- face talks.
 The Chelsea coach described his plans for the striker and made sure to stress how much the club wanted Werner to join them.
 "You understand that when there is competition from the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City that you need to state your best case to the player," Lampard said.
 "Having been that player at one point, I tried to sell the club to the best of my ability when I spoke to players. Petr in his role does the same.
 "With a player like Timo, we were very keen to bring him in. He needs to feel that from us. I loved everything that he said to me in those conversations, the same with all the players.
 "That manager-player conversation is really important because our relationship needs to be good. All you can do is your best as a club.
 "I think we can be happy that we have brought in players of their level. That is just how we tried to work. Now it is stage two, get them settled and playing to the best of their ability."
 After scoring 28 goals in the Bundesliga last season, Werner will be determined to hit the ground running in the Premier League when Chelsea face Brighton in their season opener on Monday night.
 The German international scored in his first non-competitive appearance for the Blues last month, finding the back of the net after just four minutes in a friendly against Graham Potter's side.

MANKATO, Minn. (KEYC) - A large crowd came together, walking downtown Mankato for a Pride March and Rally.The theme of the day--"Proud Together".What normally would have been Mankato’s 19th Annual Pridefest festival weekend, this year instead was celebrated with a peaceful march and rally due to COVID-19.“We still wanted to do something for our Pride so this is our Pride today," said South Central Minnesota Pride Executive Director, Jeni Kolstad.The intent was to spread unity supporting the LGBTQ community with a focus on the Black Lives Matter Movement.“We decided to do this in light of everything that’s been going on with our black and brown community members and so we wanted to pay special attention to those voices and uplift those voices in our community," said Kolstad.Community members gathered at Riverfront Park with signs and flags before marching to the Civic Center Plaza for a rally.There the crowd listened and cheered on various speakers.“Because when our communities uplift one another we are all stronger together," said speaker Margarita Ruiz during her speech.“This is not just some small town full of small minded people. We are a huge community of love, unity and beautiful diversity and it’s just going to keep getting better and better,”said speaker Jasmine D’Avilar addressing the crowd.All speakers advocated for the community to come together to take a stand on racism, trans- phobia and injustice.Copyright 2020 KEYC.
