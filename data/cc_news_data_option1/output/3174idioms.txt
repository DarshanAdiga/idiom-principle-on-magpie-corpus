Expect recovery to be much better in the next two quarters, says Rajeev Mehrotra. Can you just talk about what happened in Q1? What is the order book? Can you also tell us how things are moving in after things are opening up?This was a very difficult quarter for everybody but at RITES, we are satisfied with the performance we have delivered against last year’s turnover of Rs 573 crore. Consolidated, we delivered a Rs 379 crore turnover, almost 33% down. But if you see the composition, only because of exports, there was a reduction of about 22% because this year, the exports are not there in Q1 but are lined up in Q3 and Q4 mostly. So once we see the overall yearly performance in FY21, we will see this making up. So there is nothing to worry about whatever has been delivered. We have rather improved margins in Q1 also. Now there is a stronger order book and companies are financially strong. There are no further debts incurred. We have put in place cost management in time. As a result, we could do a reasonable turnover with margins intact on other improvements in Q1. Are things starting to look positive for the next three quarters? I think in Q2, too, there are difficulties in travel and meeting. Q2 is also going to be a little difficult. But recovery is possible in Q3 and Q4 in general. Once companies get comfortable with the general working environment, a lot of orders will start as soon as we get the chance to get full move on activity. But yes, definitely Q3 and Q4 look much better than H1. I just want to understand the consultancy segment. This is one of your largest verticals and there were disruptions in March foreign projects. I just want to know how the pipeline of projects have been? Have they picked up? Where are you seeing maximum orders coming in from?Compared to June of FY20, we are marginally up in terms of order book. We accumulated about Rs 250 crore net order inflow but there is a shift in this order book. We have added the order book of consultancy and have significantly increased the order book of exports. These are all good margin businesses compared to turnkey and the delivery would be scaled up. From now onwards, significant focus would be on the exports which are lined up for Q3 to Q4 and this can give an overall moderate growth this year. So order inflows are actually coming from consulting as well as from exports. We are expecting a major decision from the railways once they decide about the turnkey contracts, which is in the process. We are going to submit price bids on the 17 August. So I think some more orders will come hopefully in September for turnkey projects. In India, like you mentioned, metro and railways are some of the thriving segments from which you are expecting a lot of orders. But how has exports been which has been a major revenue contributor for you in the year gone by in FY20?This year also the exports hold a lot of hope for us. We already have orders of about Rs 1,429 crore which are in the pipeline for execution and shipments may start by end of Q3 and mainly in Q4. So this year, we should see a higher export growth for the previous year and attempt to push it to around Rs 600-650 crore if possible. If the production lines are in place, there are a lot of assemblies and sub assemblies which go to the production units in India. So if everybody is in a position to maintain these supply lines, we should see a much better export performance this year than over last year.

The stately and somewhat austere, vaguely Beaux Arts-style home, located two blocks from Presidio Park on one of San Francisco’s famously steep streets, was originally built in 1916. After Tolia purchased it in 2011 for $7 million, the three-level spread underwent a gut renovation that transformed the faded grande dame it into a thoroughly modern mansion designed for modern-day family living with six bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms in an undisclosed amount of square footage. “My first memory of the house is standing outside and being transfixed by the stunning Italian coffered ceiling,” Tolia said in an email to The Wall Street Journal, who first reported the listing, “The house certainly needed work, but the bones were clearly excellent, and with a little bit of love, I knew it could be a rare and special place to raise our family.”

BERLIN, AUG 11: Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said Monday he opposes the Bundesliga's plans for the partial return of football fans to stadiums next season amid the coronavirus pandemic.   "Thousands of spectators in the stadiums -- that is not suitable given the current infection rate," Spahn wrote on Twitter.   "Now is not the time to take any avoidable risks."   Last week, the clubs in Germany's top two leagues agreed to Bundesliga plans to allow the partial return of fans when the new league season begins on September 18.   The plans included clubs selling personalised tickets which could be traced, access only to seated areas of the ground, no alcohol sales at games until October and a ban on away fans until 2021.   However, the proposal by the German Football League (DFL) first needs approval by the government, and Spahn's comments dashed those hopes.   "The DFL concept is good in theory. However, in the pandemic, what is decisive is the practice in everyday life," Spahn added.   "We feel that we must remain vigilant.   "In the current situation, spectators in the stands would send the wrong signal."   Germany's top-flight clubs lose several million euros in match revenue for every home game played behind closed doors.   However, the number of coronavirus infections is rising slightly in Germany with 436 new cases in the last 24 hours. Around 9,000 virus-related deaths have been recorded in the country.   Bavaria's state premier Markus Soeder echoed Spahn's sentiments.   "I cannot imagine it and I am extremely sceptical about it," he said of the DFL's plans, worrying that seeing football fans back in stadiums would send a "devastating signal" to German society.   Earlier in the day, Dilek Kalayci, chairman of the conference of Germany's health ministers which met Monday, indicated the plan was unlikely to be approved.   "We do not intend to pass a resolution on the DFL's hygiene concept," Kalayci told newspaper Berliner Morgenpost before the conference.   "Professional football is not at the top of the health ministers' priority list."

By David Fickling Has gold’s bubble just burst? The spot metal fell 5.7 per cent Tuesday, the sharpest drop in seven years and a remarkable slump for an asset that rarely shifts more than a percentage point in a day. It fell further Wednesday, as low as $1,863 an ounce, breaking the back of an extraordinary rally. Since smashing through a long-term ceiling of around $1,350 a troy ounce last June, it had risen to a record of $2,064 an ounce earlier this month. Despite that, much of the bull run over the past year has been a long overdue correction from depressed levels. Just as gold hasn’t dropped below $1,000 an ounce since 2009, notwithstanding a prolonged slump through most of the decade, once the current volatility has cleared it's unlikely to see the south side of $1,700 again, either. 77504392The reason for this isn't that it’s a hedge against inflation or deflation — those who bought that story when U.S. consumer prices were rising at double-digit rates around gold’s real-term peak in 1980 are still underwater on their investments. The low-inflation conditions of the past decade haven’t been kind to the metal either, at least until recently. The better explanation is that gold makes up a fairly consistent portion of the world’s portfolio of liquid investments, and much of the recent price spike was just a reversion to the mean. Add together the market capitalization of the world’s equity markets, the value of global bonds outstanding, and the 42,619 metric tons of private investment gold and you have just shy of $200 trillion of liquid investment assets. Over the past five years for which Bloomberg has aggregate bond finance data, gold has made up a remarkably stable share of this pile at around 1.09 per cent, rarely dropping below 1 per cent or above 1.2 per cent. That’s similar to the sorts of allocations that many money managers would recommend for gold. For all its fake advantages, the metal has one genuinely useful property — its unrivaled ability to move in the opposite direction to equities and bond yields. That negative beta means that a sprinkling of gold in a typical investment portfolio can help smooth out the peaks and troughs in market cycles and achieve a better risk-adjusted return in the long run. 77504414The reason such unchanging allocations can translate into market prices that can jump 50 per cent in just over a year is that the asset classes are so different in scale. Even if players in the $88 trillion equity market and $108 trillion bond market make a modest shift toward metal, the effect of those funds crowding into the $2.8 trillion private investment gold space will be dramatic. It’s certainly the case that gold at current levels is defying gravity, as with any investment in the grip of speculative momentum. Still, with the metal heading below $1,900 an ounce, we’re already a considerable portion of the way down the slope. The liquid asset pile has increased by about 6 per cent a year since 2015, and incremental gold demand comes to an extra 1,250 metric tons or so annually. Should gold’s allocation drop back to its long-term average of 1.09 per cent from the current 1.38 per cent share, you’d expect to see reasonable value in the $1,600 range this year and next, rising toward $1,800 by the middle of the decade. With a modest overweighting of 1.15 per cent in light of what’s likely to be a tumultuous couple of years for the world economy, the $1,700 levels around which it traded from April to June would be a solid price floor. Gold may still fall from its current heights, but it’s probably not got all that much further to go.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Health authorities in New Zealand were scrambling Wednesday to trace the source of a new outbreak of the coronavirus as the nation’s largest city went back into lockdown.Authorities had confirmed four cases of the virus in one Auckland household from an unknown source and were awaiting the test results of four more people they suspect have infections — two work colleagues and two relatives of those in the house.The cases this week were the first known local transmission of the virus in New Zealand in 102 days. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said more than 200 people with connections to those in the house were contacted Wednesday."Our plan of mass testing, rapid contact tracing and, of course, our restrictions to stop the chain of transmission has been in full swing in Auckland today," Ardern said.Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said one of the people who tested positive works at an Americold food cold-storage facility in Auckland, which was being swabbed to check if it was possible source of the infections."We do know from studies overseas that actually, the virus can survive in some refrigerated environments for quite some time," he said.The cluster came as an unpleasant surprise to many and raised questions about whether the nation's general election would go ahead as planned next month.Bloomfield said two of the people who had tested positive had traveled to the city of Rotorua while suffering symptoms over recent days and had visited several tourist attractions. "People in Rotorua and indeed around the country should be vigilant about their health and seek advice if they have symptoms," he said.Auckland was moved to Alert Level 3 at midday Wednesday, a designation initially set to continue through midnight Friday. That means that non-essential workers are required to stay home, while bars, restaurants and most businesses will be closed.The rest of the country was moved to Alert Level 2, meaning that mass gatherings are limited to 100 attendees and people are required to socially distance themselves.A news alert is displayed on a mobile phone in Christchurch, New Zealand, Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2020. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that authorities have found four cases of the coronavirus in one Auckland household from an unknown source, the first cases of local transmission in the country in 102 days.Bloomfield said they would use genome sequencing as part of their effort to find the source of the new outbreak.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she had worked quickly to impose the Auckland lockdown measures after first learning about the cases Tuesday afternoon.She said Aucklanders were also "strongly encouraged" but not mandated to wear masks, and that authorities were releasing 5 million masks from a central supply. New Zealanders have not widely worn masks before, although authorities have been urging people to buy them or fashion them from scarves or bandannas just in case.The nation's parliament was due to be dissolved Wednesday ahead of a general election on Sept. 19 as lawmakers hit the campaign trail. But Ardern said she was delaying the dissolution until at least Monday in case lawmakers needed to meet at short notice. She said she was also seeking advice about options for the election.Under New Zealand law, the government could delay the election for up to about two months. The main candidates have already cancelled most of their planned upcoming campaign events.The outbreak was found after a man in his 50s went to his doctor Monday with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. Three more people in his household tested positive later.The case has health authorities scratching their heads, as the man had not recently traveled overseas and had no immediately apparent connection with infections contained at the border.Until Tuesday, the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travelers held in quarantine after returning from abroad.New Zealand has been praised globally for its virus response and had just celebrated reaching 100 days without any known community transmission.The South Pacific nation of 5 million initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease, stopping its spread. Life had returned to normal for many people as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Stoughton (10-1) scored three runs in the seventh to seal the victory. After Montilva’s home run gave the Merchants a 4-3 lead, Winder Fuentes singled and raced to third on a dropped third strike and scored when the thow got away to give the Merchants a 5-3 lead. Yonardo Herdenez raced to second on the throw to the plate.
 With two outs, Andres Moreno beat out an infield single and Herdenez scored to extend the Merchants’ lead to three runs.
 Montilva went 2-for-3 with a home run and two RBI. Fuentes was 2-for-4 and Herdenez scored two runs.
 Montilva pitched three shutout innings to get the win on the mound, striking out seven and walking one. He allowed two baseurnners — a walk and an infield single by Wanninger in the sixth.
 Montilva said he last pitched on Sunday, Aug. 2 and it wasn’t a good performance.
 “I rested my arm and didn’t do anything crazy,” Montilva said.
 Early on, the game had the makings of one that could go down to the wire. With two outs in the first, Herdenez walked and stole second before Dave Hanson reached on an error that scored Herdenez.

ASUNCION, AUG 11: Brazil great Ronaldinho could be freed on August 24 following five months detention in Paraguay over a forged passport, judicial sources told AFP on Monday.   The former Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain star was detained alongside his brother Roberto de Assis Moreira on March 6, accused of entering Paraguay in possession of false passports.   They spent a month behind bars before paying a $1.6 million bail and being released to house arrest at the plush Palmaroga Hotel in the historic centre of the Paraguayan capital Asuncion.   Judge Gustavo Amarilla has set a date of August 24 to hear the case against the brothers.   Prosecutors have submitted a proposal to the judge that would see Ronaldinho, 40, pay a $90,000 fine "to repair social damage" but be allowed to return home to Brazil where he would have to appear before a judge every three months for a year.   Ronaldinho denies having any knowledge the passports were fake. His brother who allegedly knew about the false passports would have to pay a $110,000 fine and appear before a judge every three months for two years.   Prosecutors also asked for a two-year suspended prison sentence for Roberto de Assis Moreira, who is also Ronaldinho's business manager.   The brothers arrived in Paraguay on March 4 without any issues, with Ronaldinho, 2005 Ballon d'Or winner, due to take part in event in support of disadvantaged children.   However, shortly after their arrival, the pair were taken into police custody when investigators raided their hotel following the discovery they had fake documents.    -AFP

Le prime linee guida per il trasporto scolastico sono state pubblicate solo con il DPCM del 7 agosto e fanno riferimento ad indicazioni generiche che non hanno fugato la grande preoccupazione ed incertezza dei mesi scorsi. Analoga incertezza e preoccupazione si registra anche per il TPL con particolare riferimento alle corse verso le scuole di Modena. Sulla base di queste indicazioni è necessario assicurare un distanziamento interpersonale sugli scuolabus e sui pullman, con conseguente diminuzione della loro capienza. Tuttavia sia le agenzie per la mobilità sia il gestore del servizio di trasporto scolastico locale hanno già riportato a tutte le Amministrazioni difficoltà nel reperire mezzi e personale necessario ad un incremento generalizzato delle corse. L’Amministrazione intende confermare il servizio di trasporto scolastico per le scuole di Nonantola e si riserva ulteriori valutazioni organizzative (linee, orari, servizi) sulla base delle nuove linee guida appena uscite e del numero di scuolabus che il gestore potrà rendere disponibili, e conferma fin da ora anche in presenza di una diversa organizzazione le tariffe previste per lo scorso anno scolastico.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. — A municipal government in China has donated 40,000 medical- grade face masks to Maryland’s capital city amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 The donations from Changsha, China, were first offered to Annapolis city officials in April, when the need for the masks among public safety workers was high in the beginning of the pandemic, Annapolis City Manager David Jarrell said in a news release Tuesday.
 They arrived this month, with one of the boxes featuring strikers of American and Chinese flags with a message that read: “Go, City of Annapolis! Best Wishes from Changsha! True unity inspires people to work as one to overcome adversity,” The Capital Gazette reported.
 Another note from Yani Xia, a representative in the Chinese city’s Foreign Affairs Office, accompanied the shipments. “We sincerely wish you and everyone in Annapolis continued good health, and the fortitude to persevere during this challenging period,” Xia’s note read.
 Annapolis’ relationship with Changsha began under a former city administrator, according to the release. The two municipalities are now sister cities.

 VAHS athletic director Joel Zimba said hosting events at the new track is something that can be explored “down the road,” however. He said the biggest advantage of having the indoor track is it offers protection from the unpredictable weather in Wisconsin.
 “As of now, the fieldhouse will be used for practices whenever the need arises,” Zimba said.
