In "Kinetta," there is no bottom to the depths of debasement these people will go. But even when the characters are degrading themselves, like when the maid allows the voyeuristic cop to rip up her dress and watch her writhe on the floor with a vacant stare, they’re in control. Or in an early scene when that same maid appears to be choking herself in a lonely room as if for an audition that will never come. That control, even at the most masochistic level, is oddly the hallmark, and often the saving grace, of any Yorgos Lanthimos movie, because ultimately these people aren’t just torturing themselves for the hell of it. They’re searching for themselves, in their own deranged way.

Secrets can be nearly impossible to contain, and such is the case with Hidden Pond Resort. After my visit to this secluded spot, tucked into a 60-acre pocket of Kennebunkport on the southern coast of Maine, wild horses couldn't keep me from dishing about my discovery.      Sure, I was already familiar with walkable downtown Kennebunkport. Its greenways and charming streets hold a special place in my heart. It feels like time travel to a town where people still stroll, couples walk hand in hand, and everyone greets each other.      I was shocked when my sister, Cheryl, who resides less than two hours south, confessed she'd never been there. In an instant, the idea to celebrate her upcoming birthday at Kennebunkport's much-acclaimed Hidden Pond was hatched.      Check-in at Hidden Pond takes place in a building nestled in the depths of a birch tree forest that was part of an old estate. Here, we were given a map of the property and pointed to the road where we'd find our accommodations, aptly named The Stargazer. We were impressed with this bi-level, two-bedroom, three bath cottage -- and even more impressed by its interior, with its screened porch, full kitchen and dining room, fireplaced living room and outdoor shower.      The bedrooms were equally luxurious, no quibbling necessary. We left our luggage in our respective rooms and headed back out to locate The Tree Spa, where pre-scheduled aromatherapy massages were calling our names. The surrounding beauty of nature distracted us from following our map, however, and we walked straight past Earth, Hidden Pond's critically raved-about restaurant. Once we backtracked our steps, we stopped inside the restaurant for direction. Inside, we admired its eclectic decor, and outside, the saltwater pool was inviting, and right behind the pool, voila ­-- the Tree Spa. Ensconced in treehouse-style massage rooms, we inhaled both the aroma of the pine trees outside and the lavender oil being expertly rubbed onto our skin.      Afterward, relaxed and rubbery, we called one of Hidden Pond's complimentary shuttles, with the goal of hitting happy hour at Hidden Pond's sister property, The Tides Beach Club.      The club's unobstructed view of Goose Rocks Beach and the crash of waves against the rocks mesmerized us as we sipped on a pair of watermelon Cosmos. Could it get any better? Why yes, it could, I realized as I tucked into a best-of-my-life Maine lobster roll, paired perfectly with a glass (or two) of chilled Chablis. The club's bar scene was lively, and we met a few patrons who said they'd returned to Hidden Pond twice, thrice or four times. This was not all that surprising.      Energized and not quite ready for the night to end, we stopped by the resort's communal firepit and indulged in s'mores, with all the luxury makin's ready for use, courtesy of Earth restaurant.      My sister is an early bird, and by the time I wandered downstairs from my blissful night's sleep, she had already dug into the coffee and pastries conveniently left on our doorstep. This was a "light" breakfast, but a heartier version is available at Earth.      We had a game plan for Cheryl's birthday and were soon on the road to Ricker Hill Orchards, a ninth-generation family farm about 60 minutes inland, to pick organic apples. Apple picking made us hungry, so we fueled up at Terry & Maxine's in the town of Turner. Their turkey and Swiss Rachel sandwich hit the proverbial spot.      Next stop, downtown Kennebunkport. As I'd hoped would happen, Cheryl was enchanted by the town and its unique shops, eateries and art galleries lining the charming streets.      Back at Hidden Pond, we headed to its garden shed, where we were encouraged to grab a vase and clip an arrangement of local wildflowers to grace the table at our cottage.      As the climax to this birthday weekend, I had arranged dinner for us at Earth. Our farm-to-fork meal featured an innovative menu created by Hidden Pond's Executive Chef Joe Schafer. It incorporated vegetables and herbs picked from Earth's on-site organic farm, freshly caught seafood and meats sourced from local purveyors.      No late-night s'mores for us this evening; we simply rolled back to The Stargazer cottage, flicked a switch, and chilled out by the gas fireplace for a while. We checked out the following morning, begrudgingly, as we longed to stay forever, hidden in the fold of Hidden Pond. Alas, it was time to return to real life.

"That person could be linked to a crime that was committed three streets down," she said.
 In Punta Gorda, Lt. Dylan Renz said it appears crime is slightly down across the board, except for a higher than usual number of vehicle thefts, including golf carts, in March.
 Likewise, in North Port, Spokesperson Josh Taylor said crime is "definitely down," but the agency has had to increase patrolling in the Yorkshire area where people tend to congregate, ride ATVs, and camp out illegally.
 "People are still looking to get together," he said. "As you know, that's not a great idea right now. It's similar to what boating communities have had to do to keep people from congregating and not following the social distancing guidelines on the water."

"articleBody": "
 Canadians are rightly outraged by the appalling conditions in long-term-care homes with COVID-19 outbreaks. Seniors, everyone is quick to say, deserve to live out their final years and die with dignity.
 That's clearly not the case now and making it so requires immediate action. We need to "refocus our efforts to make sure that everybody has an opportunity to age in dignity with the care they deserve at the end of their lives," says federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu.
 She calls this a "project for Canada."
 But surely our collective aspiration must be greater than that. Canadians should have the opportunity to live their entire lives with dignity.
 This pandemic has laid bare the deep social inequalities, distortions in our economy and frayed social safety net that means that's not the case for far too many people long before they reach their care-home years.
 There's nothing like governments telling people to stay home to focus attention on the fact that tens of thousands of people don't have a room of their own, let alone a home. In fact, with libraries, shopping malls and so many coffee shops now closed, the homeless no longer even have access to a bathroom. Where is the dignity in that?
 On First Nations reserves housing is so badly overcrowded, and there are such high rates of poverty and pre-existing health conditions, that governments are essentially keeping their fingers crossed knowing how devastating it will be if COVID-19 tears through those communities.
 When public health officials told people to stay home when they were sick it highlighted how many people have no workplace benefits to let them do that.
 When politicians urged essential workers to stay on the job we were all confronted with the uncomfortable reality that many of the people vital to keeping food on our tables and caring for the most vulnerable among us were precariously employed and poorly paid.
 Indeed, the pay and conditions of some work has fallen to such depths that Canadians don't even do it. That's why the federal government is scrambling to accommodate the migrant farm labourers we rely on to plant and pick our crops.
 The battle against COVID-19 has affected everyone, from CEOs to cashiers. But the divide between Canadians is revealed in how we ride out the storm.
 Some are hunkered down in comfortable homes with secure jobs that continue to pay them whether they're working normally or not. They have benefits, pensions and savings in the bank.
 Others are struggling even more than usual to afford the rent. If their jobs weren't deemed essential they've likely lost them entirely. They have little savings to fall bac- on. They must rely on federal assistance and are, no doubt, piling up debt.
 Years of low-paid, part-time and contract work coupled with high housing prices has left many Canadians ill prepared for any kind of economic upheaval. Trying to recovery from this will be that much harder as a consequence.
 Our economy has not been working for an increasingly large number of people and our governments, either through regulations or programs, have done little to fix that.
 Having been brought together through this crisis, Canadians have an opportunity to decide that we should not simply go back to the old way of doing things. We should strive for something better.
 Working together we can push governments and businesses to build a more inclusive economy that offers full-time jobs with decent wages and benefits. We can repair the frayed social safety net.
 This crisis has already demonstrated that governments -- provincial and federal -- can quickly alter policies and programs to better suit the needs of Canadians when they are highly motivated to do so.
 One school of thought suggests our eyes have now been opened and it's almost a given this will continue. Sadly, it's not.
 Our experience with COVID-19 should change everything and it's easy to spot signs of hope that it will. Cashiers and cleaners have achieved hero status and even a fiscal conservative like Ontario Premier Doug Ford says we'll make things here from now on, even if it costs more.
 But how long will Ford maintain that view once the crisis passes? Will he and others apply it beyond manufacturing personal protective equipment to areas where doing the right thing costs more than governments and businesses have so far been willing to pay?
 Once this lockdown on our lives and the economy finally ends there will be a powerful push to just get back to normal. It's very likely the economic inequality and social justice issues, thrust into the spotlight by the fight to contain the coronavirus, will be seen as less urgent and, once again, put on the back burner.
 It's taking active governments willing to spend money and supported by citizens to get us through this pandemic. And that's what it will take after this is over to make Canada a place where people can live and age with dignity.
 Now that would be a worthy "project" for Canada.

Diego Simeone's charges have moved to the summit after Real Madrid suffered two defeats in less than a week, following up their 4-3 _Clasico_ loss to Barcelona with a 2-1 reverse at Sevilla.
 Atletico lead Barcelona by one point, with Real now three points adrift in third.
 Thanks to the form of traditional heavyweights Barca and Real, Atletico have done much of their good work this season as part of the chasing pack.
 But placed firmly in the spotlight after recent results, they will face a difficult challenge at the fourth-placed Bilbao.
 Saturday's hosts have also been in impressive form as they look to have all but nailed down the final UEFA Champions League spot.
 Ernesto Valverde's side are six points clear of fifth-placed Sevilla and have lost just one of their last 12 league games.
 They will have to stop Atleti hitman Diego Costa, though, who sits second behind only Real superstar Cristiano Ronaldo in the goalscoring charts with 24 Liga strikes to his name this term. The Spain international scored Atleti's second goal in their 2-0 triumph over Bilbao in the reverse fixture.
 Real, meanwhile, need to arrest their form slump if they are to be in with any chance of winning the title, with Rayo Vallecano the visitors to the Bernabeu on Saturday.
 Sergio Ramos will return from suspension for Real, who have seen Ronaldo score in seven successive fixtures in all competitions.
 They will face a buoyant Rayo side though, with a five-match unbeaten run - including four wins - helping steer the Madrid club clear of the relegation zone.
 Barcelona have scored 14 goals in their last three league fixtures but will have to do without goalkeeper Victor Valdes when they visit local rivals Espanyol on Saturday.
 Valdes has played his last game for the club after suffering a serious knee injury in the club's 3-0 win over Celta Vigo on Wednesday. The shot-stopper is due to leave Camp Nou at the end of the season.
 Captain Carles Puyol (knee) remains doubtful and Andres Iniesta (thigh) is also an injury concern for Gerardo Martino.
 Also on Saturday, Sevilla head to Vigo in good spirits after their win over Real - their sixth Liga victory in a row - while Sunday's matches involve a host of relegation rivals.
 Second-bottom Real Valladolid can move ahead of the 16th-placed Almeria with victory at Estadio Municipal Jose Zorrilla, while Getafe, who sit 18th after a nightmare run of 15 games without a win, visit Valencia.

Carlo Ancelotti's side rescued a 3-2 win at Estadi Ciutat de Valencia in October with stoppage-time goals from Alvaro Morata and Cristiano Ronaldo.
 They will enter this weekend's game a point clear at the top of La Liga following last week's 2-2 draw with city rivals Atletico Madrid, sealed by another late Ronaldo goal.
 Real are currently the form team in La Liga after not tasting defeat in any competition since losing to Barcelona at Camp Nou in October, going 28 matches unbeaten since.      Ancelotti will no doubt be glad to have the gruelling and "violent" Atleti match behind him as his side look to nail home their advantage at the top of the table as the season enters its final stages.      He said: "They tried to impose a violent game. We tried to play and in the end we did it (got a draw).      "The response was good and overall we can be satisfied because Atletico are a good team, particularly at home.      "We're top and that's good. Now we have seven games at home and five away."      Since their Bernabeu defeat to Atleti in September, Real have been irresistible at home in all competitions, winning every single one of their following 15 games on their own patch.      Levante are enjoying a surprisingly good campaign under well-regarded coach Caparros, who has reportedly emerged as a target for former side Sevilla should they opt against renewing Unai Emery's contract in the summer.      A run of six defeats in seven league matches looked to have put pay to their slim European hopes in early January, but they have since gone eight domestic games unbeaten and sit eighth, reigniting their chances.      The two sides go into this fixture on the back of a brief international break and Real's front men were in good form for the respective countries, with Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale all netting during the week.      While Ancelotti does not have significant injury problems to contend with, Pepe is a doubt due to illness, while Dani Carvajal and Marcelo are expected to be restored to the full-back berths.      Caparros will be without suspended trio Pape Diop, Victor Cassadeus and Simao Mate, while Christian Lell (stomach) and Issam El Adoua (foot) are doubts, despite both returning to training.

Winning without playing in top gear is often heralded as a hallmark of champions, and Diego Simeone's side are well-placed for the title on that basis, with Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at Sevilla putting them clear at the top.
 Atleti struggled to break down their opponents in a frustrating first half that saw Arda Turan go closest.
 But top scorer Diego Costa came to their rescue after 63 minutes with his 24th Liga goal of the season.
 Real's defeat means Atleti are now a point clear of Barcelona as the advantage in the title race continues to swing between the three teams.
 But it is the season's surprise package Atleti who now appear in control after a 17th-consecutive home league game without defeat.
 Turan had the hosts' best chances in the opening stages, first prodding wide after David Villa's near-post flick was blocked and then skewing a poor effort off target from 20 yards.
 Simeone had called for a vocal backing from home support ahead of the game, and they did their best to generate an atmosphere, despite there being little to shout about on the pitch.
 Youssef El-Arabi nodded a Granada corner wide and Atleti midfielder Tiago saw a goal chalked off for a foul in the build-up as things heated up before the break.
 The atmosphere dropped as Thibaut Courtois was forced to keep out Yacine Brahimi's fierce effort and the visitors were quick out the blocks in the second half, Recio and Jeison Murillo somehow failing to turn Fran Rico's corner home.
 But Atleti finally got their act together just after the hour as Costa put them ahead.
 Having seen Roberto keep out a firm header from Gabi's corner just two minutes earlier, Costa met another delivery from the home captain and got his effort beyond the veteran goalkeeper to raise the volume in the Calderon once again.
 Atleti looked to see the game out with a much more disciplined showing after the goal, and the players may have been buoyed as a roar went around the ground 75 minutes in as news of Real going behind filtered through the crowd.
 Roberto did well to deny Gabi and substitute Diego as Atleti pushed for a second, but Atleti were ultimately left to settle for the narrow scoreline.
 Defeat for Granada keeps them looking over their shoulders, just six points clear of the bottom three, while the hard-fought three points could prove crucial come the season's conclusion for Atleti as they seek their first league crown since 1996.

With the COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of slowing its spread, governments across the world are trying to use mobile technology to trace people thought to have the virus. But how do these mobile contact- tracing apps work, and can they help in flattening the curve?Nearly 2.14 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally.More than 200 countries across the world have declared a war on this invisible enemy. But no one has managed to defeat it yet.Coronavirus can only be contained if those infected are successfully isolated and treated. And this is where bluetooth-driven contact-tracing apps can come in handy.So what is this technology about? The first step is obviously to download the app. The user then needs to update his or her COVID-19 status. These apps use the phone’s bluetooth technology to determine if a given user came in close proximity with an infected person. If it happens, it alerts the user with a notification and urges him to get tested and self-isolate. In principle, this system is more efficient than traditional contact-tracing methods that require the concerned staff to interview patients about their travels. Many countries have already adopted this technology, and others are likely to follow suit.Singapore is the first country to have implemented contact-tracing via bluetooth with an app called “trace together.”India’s Arogya Setu app also works on the same technology.Other countries such as Israel, China, and South Korea are also using similar apps to contain the spread of the deadly virus.Tech giants like Apple and Google are working on new tools to make app- based tracing more effective.The companies say their technology could enable apps to monitor contacts for a 14-day period.Eventually, the process of digital tracing could help authorities relax lockdowns in some parts and enable more selective quarantines.In other words, it can help decision makers determine which areas are relatively safer.Is it effective? Researchers say that digital tracing can be effective only if 60 per cent of the population downloads the app and updates their status. Experts believe that contact tracing is helpful only in countries where mass testing is available. There are privacy-related concerns around contact-tracing apps. Privacy advocates worry that such a database could be a hackers’ goldmine. Some researchers say contact-tracing can be implemented while protecting privacy. Although this will vary from app to app in each country.The technology looks promising, but it needs the support of users to be effective.

 City are still in the running for three other trophies, with the domestic treble looking a real possibility, but Kompany moved to cool expectations after City's first League Cup title since 1976.
 "One thing at a time, let's bear in mind, for our club, it's a new trophy, a new experience and I want everybody to cherish it first of all," he added.

Furthermore, the jarring number of lives that the virus has already claimed will only further encourage people to get routine care and maintain healthier lifestyles, acting as yet another reason for more frequent visits with a primary care physician. These factors, in light of a newfound appeal toward social distancing, create the perfect platform for concierge medicine.

Smith, who formerly led the Cleveland Clinic’s initial telehealth efforts, says that providers forced to adopt telemedicine in their short-term response to COVID-19 will recognize telemedicine as essential in the long term.

Jim Alexander is an Inland Empire native who started with his hometown newspaper, The Press-Enterprise, longer ago than he cares to admit. He's been a sports columnist off and on since 1992, and a full-time columnist since 2010. Yes, he's opinionated, but no, that's not the only club in his bag. He's covered every major league and major sports beat in Southern California over the years, so not much surprises him any more. (And he and Justin Turner have this in common: Both attended Cal State Fullerton. Jim has no plans to replicate Turner's beard.)

L'épidémie du nouveau coronavirus révèle les sous-effectifs chroniques des maisons de retraite médicalisées (Ehpad) mais aussi une solidarité de toutes les catégories du personnel pour soigner les personnes âgées, leur apporter du réconfort et maintenir les liens familiaux.
 Le "plan bleu" déclenché par le gouvernement début mars dans les maisons de retraite - et son équivalent le plan blanc dans les établissements de santé - imposent une mobilisation "maximale" face à l'épidémie du Covid-19.
 Dans la pratique, "le manque d'effectif était déjà criant avant, les établissements sont encore plus mis à mal avec jusqu'à 40% d'absentéisme dans certains endroits", déplore Malika Belarbi, aide-soignante et responsable du collectif national CGT pour l'accueil des personnes âgées.
 Or, "dans un secteur en sous-effectif tout au long de l'année, vous avez intérêt à faire preuve de solidarité, d'autant plus en période de crise", complète Romain Gizolme, directeur de l'Association des directeurs au service des personnes âgées (AD-PA).
 La situation est "très dure", confie Marie-France, infirmière dans un Ehpad des Hauts-de-Seine, affectée dans une unité Covid. "On voit nos patients se dégrader, perdre du poids, mourir devant nous en quelques heures, on est impuissants." Pour la seule journée de mercredi, deux résidents de son unité sont décédés.
 "Heureusement que les autres services sont là: personnels administratifs, pédicures, esthéticiennes, psychologues nous aident. Ils se retrouvent en première ligne pour renforcer les équipes. Ce n'est pas leur métier mais ils le font par solidarité et dévouement", insiste Malika Belarbi, qui raconte s'être "retrouvée il y a deux jours avec une pédicure en train de faire la vaisselle de 40 résidents".
 \- "Les barrières hiérarchiques tombent" -
 "Quand vous devez imposer un confinement, heureusement que le personnel soignant et aide-soignant donne un coup de main au personnel de restauration pour distribuer les repas en chambre", souligne Romain Gizolme.
 "Des agents de la direction, des secrétaires nous aident à les faire manger, je fais équipe avec une collègue de Bretagne venue en renfort. Cela nous fait beaucoup de bien", détaille Marie-France.
 Aïcha, qui travaille au service des admissions d'un Ehpad d'Asnières (Hauts- de-Seine), s'est portée volontaire pour épauler ses collègues soignants. "Je les décharge de leurs tâches administratives", comme par exemple l'organisation du départ des personnes décédées. Elle décrit une "chaîne de solidarité" qui l'envoie "sur le terrain tous les jours".
 "Il y a une implication de tous. Je n'ai jamais vu autant de solidarité entre les équipes", confirme Raphaël Berhaïel, délégué central CFDT au sein du groupe Korian, numéro un européen des maisons de retraite.
 "Avant, il y avait un certain individualisme. On finissait le boulot et on rentrait chez soi. Aujourd'hui, on prend des nouvelles. Il y a une volonté de bien veiller les uns sur les autres. Même les barrières hiérarchiques tombent", ajoute M. Berhaïel.
 Le personnel se met souvent en quatre pour maintenir le lien avec les proches. "Des équipes ont été mises en place pour donner des nouvelles quotidiennement aux familles", explique ce soignant.
 "Dans mon établissement, une animatrice organise des sessions de visio- conférence via Skype", raconte Marie-France. "On essaie de prendre le temps, d'être au maximum avec les résidents pour les soutenir. Certains de ceux qui nous ont quittés sont morts non pas du Covid mais de tristesse."
 Pour Romain Gizolme, "cette crise révèle le meilleur, le très grand engagement des professionnels, au prix parfois de leur santé. Et aussi le pire, en montrant combien le secteur est en sous-effectif".

After their UEFA Champions League exploits against Milan during the week, Atletico looked off the pace and laboured at Vicente Calderon, with Espanyol proving to be resolute opponents.
 Clear-cut chances were few and far between for long spells, with David Villa denied by visiting goalkeeper Kiko Casilla in a rare sight of goal early on.
 But Diego Costa eventually netted his 22nd La Liga goal of the season after showing a superb turn of pace to give the hosts the win they needed and keep their title push on track.
 Espanyol enjoyed their fair share of pressure in the final 20 minutes, but Atletico held on to keep pace with Real following their 1-0 win in Malaga.
 The 4-1 over Milan in midweek ensured that Atletico will be present in the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 1997, but coach Diego Simeone was quick to remind his players in the build-up to this match that they must remain focused domestically as well.
 Although Atletico got off to a relatively sluggish start, they did create the match's first real chance in the 14th minute, as Casilla tipped Villa’s header around the post following a dangerous free-kick delivery from Jose Sosa.      Thibaut Courtois pulled off an impressive stop of his own five minutes later, acrobatically parrying the ball away after Sergio Garcia's initial shot had taken a big deflection off Toby Alderweireld.      Costa clearly felt aggrieved 27 minutes in as referee Pedro Perez waved away his penalty claims after the Spain international had appeared to be unfairly brought down by Juan Fuentes.      Atletico continued to lack cutting edge at the beginning of the second half as the match started to become disjointed, but they did finally find the breakthrough in the 55th minute.
 Villa played a clever pass behind Diego Colotto and Costa burst past the Argentinian before charging into the area and confidently slotting past Casilla.      Costa could have doubled his tally 10 minutes later as he darted between Colotto and Hector Moreno, evaded Casilla and then shot from a narrow angle, but he was unbalanced and his effort went well over.
 Espanyol played with renewed determination in the final 15 minutes and David Lopez forced Courtois into a crucial save, but Atletico ultimately held on for a slender victory to remain in the hunt near the summit.

The Premier League side lost 2-1 in the second leg of the last 16 tie at Camp Nou on Wednesday to bow out 4-1 on aggregate.
 Lionel Messi's 28th goal of the season put the Spanish champions in front in the second half, but Kompany looked to have denied Barca victory on the night just a minute from time.
 It was a case of _deja vu_ for City though, as Dani Alves scored a late goal - just as he had done in the first leg - to add insult to injury for the visitors.
 Despite their exit, Kompany was still full of pride for the manner in which City had approached the clash, and he is confident that they can make an impact in the competition next season.
 The Belgium defender told _Sky Sports_ : "We've got nothing left in the tank, we gave everything. We could have scored earlier which would have changed the game.
 "You have to take your half chances against the best teams. Over the course of the two games there was not much between the sides. Lionel Messi is incredible player but outside of that it was even.
 "Only the winners get remembered but it's only our third season in the Champions League. The way we have played means we should fear nobody next season and our time will come."
 Pablo Zabaleta was sent off 12 minutes from time for a second bookable offence after showing dissent following referee Stephane Lannoy's failure to award a penalty for a challenge from Gerard Pique on Edin Dzeko - much to City's obvious dismay.
 And Kompany also felt aggrieved that the French official had failed to point to the spot.
 "It was a clear penalty as well. Edin Dzeko was in position to shoot and his trigger foot was caught," he added.

Khan's statement definitely criticized religious revivalist movements. It had to do with the rise of communal tension in the 1920s. For example, eminent historian Sumit Sarkar ( _Modern India_ ) said that the Tabligh Jamaat came into a reaction of the _shuddhi_ (purification) movement of the Arya Samaj and the Hindu Mahasabha. But even he did not jump to conclusions that the Tabligh Jamaat was a "baby" of the colonial British government. As Sarkar said,

Originally conceived as a "drive-through" protest in opposition to Whitmer's expanded executive order, which critics say is excessive and hurting small businesses, organizers advised people to stay in their cars so as not to spread the coronavirus. Nevertheless, the protesters rebelled against the protest's own organizers, with many getting out of their cars and gathering in front of the Capitol building. Many did not wear face masks, and many stood closer than six feet apart — including Gibbs, who was spotted walking around. That's her in the red coat in the photo above.
