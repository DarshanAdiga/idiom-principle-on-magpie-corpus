Bronke has allowed 19 earned runs in 17⅔ innings over his first two seasons as a Redbird. His inflated 14.54 ERA in the abbreviated spring season is a bit misleading because one poor outing overshadowed four scoreless efforts.
 “I love it at ISU. It’s more of a confidence thing,” said Bronke, who transferred from Heartland College. “Being a juco guy going Division I, I don’t think I adjusted to it as quickly as I would like. I’m kind of on a roll. The confidence knowing you can get guys out really helps. I will be carrying the confidence of the summer into the fall (at ISU).”

Self- proclaimed "rapstress" Lemon and Kiara performed their verses comfortably while Ralph asked both BOA and Tynomi to "kick it up" a notch with more personality. Naturally, their fifth member Jimbo, had everyone laughing their butts off with his delivery. As for The Mooseknuckles, Priyanka, BOA and Scarlett impressed their teammates with solid recordings just before Anastarzia took the mic to stumble over her words with intimidation.

Throwing open the French doors of my guest room at Bernardus Lodge & Spa in Carmel Valley, California, and mid-sip from a glass of the resort's eponymous Sauvignon Blanc, I ruminated on the risks and rewards of travel during this unsettling time.      I was distracted for a moment, not only by the crisp and expressive Monterey County wine in my hand, but by a rabbit hopping among the lavender blooms just a few feet away. I rather envied this cotton-tailed cutie who appeared blissfully unaware of the travails of life during a pandemic.      This Forbes-rated, four-star open luxury resort was just three hours from my home in Napa Valley, for which I was grateful, as driving seems the safest option for a travel adventure now. With my four-legged travel companion, Freddie, in tow, and my next-door neighbor, Tara -- the two closest connections I've had for the past several months -- we hit the road, giddy at the prospect of a change of scenery.      Arriving at Bernardus, we were greeted by a masked bellman who explained where to park, since there would be no valet service on this visit. We were offered and accepted, however, assistance with our luggage. Check-in was swift, with a plexiglass partition at the front desk, social distancing in place and a reminder about mandatory mask-wearing on the property. All signed in, I availed myself a dollop of hand sanitizer from the bottle I spotted in front of me, available for guest use.      This resort has remained open for business throughout the pandemic, which means they've had plenty of time to adhere and adjust to California's health guidelines for guests. The lodge, in fact, was almost fully booked while I was there. Yet, there's plentiful open space on the property for guests to stroll, including an exquisite rose garden within which raised beds of organic produce are grown exclusively for use by Executive Chef Cal Stamenov and his sensory- stoking culinary offerings.      Everywhere I turn, lavender is in aromatic bloom, even between the purplish artichokes stretched skyward from Cal's garden. Notably, the rose garden is strategically sited so as to frame the view of Bernardus' estate vineyards, with its backdrop of the Santa Lucia Mountains.      Reservations are required for outdoor seating at the resort's Lucia Restaurant & Bar, and diners share a single-use paper menu at every meal.      Tara and I feel almost mischievous as we remove our face masks in order to eat, yet we were also conscious of the increased risk to the waitstaff. We accepted a pour of the sparkling rose we brought in celebration of our outing and gleefully toasted to a dinner we did not have to cook ourselves.      Only one thing could have made the experience feel more decadent -- to be seated at the Chef's Table within the kitchen where the walls are adorned with scratched signatures of various celebrities, including culinary great and native Californian Julia Child. That experience is not being offered until post-pandemic.      Honestly, it has been so long since I've been in a restaurant that I'd almost forgotten how much pleasure there is in dining out.      After that, I was primed for a hot, detoxifying salt bath in the luxuriously deep soaking tub in my room, followed by a nightcap while seated next to the in-room fireplace. Minutes later, I fell into a trance-like sleep.      The next day, Tara, Freddie and I got back in the car for a drive into the nearby village of Carmel. There, a full mile of artisan shops and more than 20 tasting rooms beckoned. But wait, many of those rooms were not open, thanks to COVID-19. So, our plan switched to a walk on the beach at Carmel-by-the-Sea.      Yikes! The temperature by the ocean was at least 20 degrees cooler than the valley, bringing on the shivers, so we hiked back uphill, donned our masks and power-shopped for a while. We grabbed a snack at an outdoor courtyard restaurant before retreating back to our secluded deck at the Lodge. That evening, takeout pizza from Lucia Restaurant seemed like the ideal solution for supper. We scarfed it down while polishing off the last of the Bernardus Sauvignon Blanc.      How did it feel to travel, sleep, shop and eat in the age of COVID-19? Truth be told, the adventure satiated my need to get out and feel normal, and I was grateful for the opportunity to do it, especially at such a lovely spot as Bernardus, but I could not shake a deep awareness of being "on guard," never forgetting all of the extreme precautions that I -- and others employed in the hospitality industry -- took to make it happen. Odd and eerie at times? Yes. But worth it? Absolutely.      Charlene Peters travels the world to discover culinary dishes and worthy wines to share with readers.

Julie Rawls is keeping busy this summer, working local camps and giving softball lessons in Lafayette, Louisiana.
 Lafayette has been home away from home the past two years for the former Hallsville High School softball standout, and it’ll be that way for at least another season since she elected to return to school and play for the Louisiana Ragin Cajuns in 2021.
 Earlier this week, Rawls was informed the school thinks pretty highly of her also when she was named the team’s NCAA nominee for NCAA Woman of the Year.
 The program, established in 1991, honors the academic achievements, excellence in athletics, community service and leadership of graduating female college athletes from all three divisions.
 According to the program’s website, to be eligible, a nominee must have competed and earned a varsity letter in an NCAA-sponsored sport and must have earned her undergraduate degree by Summer 2020 (or demonstrate she would have earned her degree if not for the COVID-19 pandemic).
 Rawls checked all of the boxes. ...and then some.
 A standout on the field where she was a NFCA All-Central Region second team pick and an All-Sun Belt and All-Louisiana first team pick in 2019 and a preseason All-Sun Belt selection heading into the 2020 season, she also graduated in May.
 “I graduated with a marketing degree, and my plan this summer was to study for my LSAT (Law School Admission Test),” Rawls said. “But, since the Coronavirus happened, I pretty much knew I wanted to come back and end things on my own terms.”
 Thanks to an NCAA ruling that allows players who lost all or most of a season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rawls will return to the diamond in the spring.
 She was hitting .315 with five home runs, 10 extra base hits and a team- leading 20 walks when the 2020 season came to a grinding halt after the Cajuns had completed a sweep of Sam Houston State University (19-0, 15-0) on March 11. She was 3-for-5 at the dish with a home run, a double and three walks in the series.
 Rawls hit .360 with 10 home runs, nine doubles and 49 RBI as a junior, appearing in and starting 55 games in her debut season at Louisiana after transferring from Northwestern State University.
 She played 91 games in two seasons at Northwestern State — hitting .193 with a home run and 10 RBI as a freshman in 2017 and .296 with 10 home runs and 36 RBI as a sophomore.
 At Hallsville High School, Rawls hit .491 as a senior with nine home runs, 36 RBI and 41 stolen bases after a junior campaign that sawher hit at a .522 clip with five home runs, 10 doubles, six triples, 33 RBI and 48 runs scored.
 She has spent the past week working a camp, along with Cajun teammates Alissa Dalton and Summer Ellyson.
 “From my understanding, the NCAA will send an email letting me know if I made it to the next round,” Rawls said of the Woman of the Year award.
 Eligible female student-athletes are nominated by their member school. Each conference office then reviews the nominations from its core member schools. The NCAA Woman of the Year selection committee will then identify the top 30 — 10 from each division — and from there select three finalists from each division. From nine finalists, the NCAA Committee on Women’s Athletics selects the NCAA Woman of the Year, who will be named this fall.

Games! Let's Play Games!

“The coaches, we’re all pretty excited,” Goettl said. “It seems like more of a playoff-type atmosphere. We’re going in to face teams we haven’t played before so it’s going to be new, like you would play a playoff game. You have a team you haven’t really seen before so you go off film and there’s going to be a lot more detail going into it because you don’t know any of their nuances like the teams you play every year.”
 The exodus of Elk Mound, Durand and Mondovi also creates opportunity at the top half of the conference. Those programs along with Spring Valley have been the most consistently strong teams in the league in recent years and while new faces Clear Lake and Turtle Lake qualified for the Division 7 playoffs a season ago and Cadott just missed out on the playoffs last year, coaches in the league feel the opportunity for upward mobility with many teams is there.
 The nonconference schedule for Dunn-St. Croix teams is also simplified this year with the first and second weeks reserved for non-league games. Previously teams in the Dunn-St. Croix had nonconference games in the first two weeks as well as another on a rotating basis between conference teams from weeks three through nine. Cadott was able to maintain its decades-long rivalry with the Cloverbelt’s Stanley-Boyd by scheduling a season-opening matchup as well as picking up a game against Lake Holcombe/Cornell for week two.
 Cadott was able to keep a long-time rival in the Orioles while scheduling the Knights, another close-in-proximity team while drawing back to a time when the Hornets faced Cornell in nonconference play during the days of the Large and Small Cloverbelt Conferences. Previously in Cloverbelt Conference play, one team per week would have a nonconference game in the 9-team league while the other eight played in four league games.
 “It gives you a chance to get ready for conference play a little better,” Goettl said of the change.
 Colfax is set to face Whitehall and Eleva-Strum in the first two weeks while the Bulldogs will battle Independence/Gilmanton and Cameron.
 With so much turnover, programs will be spending plenty of time getting up to speed on their league foes with DeMoe saying that also gives teams including his Vikings the opportunity for a fresh start.
 “I told my kids when we were in contact with them having meetings we have the ability to take four teams before that have never played us and it’s our job to decide what we want them to think of us,” DeMoe said. “Do we want them to think we’re soft? Do we want them to think we’re competitors and oh crap this team is pretty good in the Dunn-St. Croix? We’re the only ones that can change that.”
 With several new squads calling the Dunn-St. Croix home beginning this year, optimism is high for many teams looking to move up the ladder and become a conference title contender.
 But above all else, teams are excited to hopefully get the chance to return to the field.
 “There’s a lot of excitement right now because nothing has happened since the end of high school basketball where the boys didn’t even get to continue,” Roemhild said. “Right now everybody’s hoping we get to play and that’s the number one excitement out of everything. When the conferences changed there was some uproar with teams and right now I think it’s to the point where people are just excited to see some sort of athletic event going on and we’re hoping, we’re preparing the season is going to go on as normal.

Business owners across San Diego County stress it’s not the safety measures they take issue with, but rather the unequal distribution of the rules. Some businesses, they say, are suffering more than others, and they feel it’s not always logical why certain businesses are deemed more essential than others.
 “The government has called cigarettes and alcohol essential while considering a fitness center that builds your mental health and immune system unessential,” Gilbert said. “That makes zero sense to people in California.”
 It’s a debate that’s raged among San Diego County businesses for months now, hinging on the interpretation of what exactly is an “essential business,” which is loosely defined by the federal government as falling into one of _16 critical infrastructure sectors_. But there’s a lot of gray area in this language, leading to much frustration about who’s staying open and who isn’t. For example, Big 5 Sporting Goods, a national retailer, sells guns and therefore deemed itself essential. But Play It Again Sports in Pacific Beach, a small franchise business in direct competition to Big 5, had to shut down.
 Even in the most stringent era of the first shutdown, the lack of clarity led everyone from dog groomers to bike shops and other businesses to decide whether they were exempt and therefore able to remain open. That’s because enforcement, at least for now, is mostly being left up to the universal honor code.

Original network content is more scarce these days, so some viewers might be grateful just to see stars of a once-beloved show reunited. Still, a lot of those who have never sat through a network sales pitch at Rockefeller Center might have felt a trifle mystified by the relentless shilling, and the awkward transitions from the fresh material shot to the extended promotional packages.


  That advertising pushed all things owned by Comcast, including its various cable and broadcast networks and Universal theme parks. All told, it was a far cry from the earlier "Parks and Recreation" special that NBC aired earlier in the pandemic, which raised money for a charitable cause.


  The ostensible plot involved former page Kenneth (Jack McBrayer), now the head of the network, floating the prospect of a "TGS" revival. McBrayer played himself and his assistant in a dual role -- among the clever visual flourishes, including the use of green screens to augment the wackiness around Tracy Morgan's character.

 “We’re not light switches,” he said, explaining that his business can’t just be switched off and on. Employees need training, experience and steady work, and when their employer shuts down, they find another job.

 “We believe those who have concerns will stay home...and those who feel they need to be at church for their own spiritual health and well-being will be here,” McGarity wrote. “We also believe we are contributing positively to the public health, especially the spiritual, emotional, mental, and even physical health side by being out of the house and worshipping our Lord.”
 The church offers indoor and outdoor services and encourages people to attend the style they are most comfortable with. In his post, McGarity said that other churches have also decided to stay open.

The governor said the Gaming Board was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, just like everything else. Now that it is back at work, it’s dealt with a number of backlogged issues. It’s important, he said, because revenues from the gambling expansion bill passed last year are to fund infrastructure programs throughout the state.
 “(IGB) just got up and running the sports wagering in the state,… a difficult thing to get done but they did, and expanded video gaming terminals in the state, another part of our capital program,” he said. “And then of course, we want very badly to make sure that our casinos get up and running. It’s economic development, its job creation, it’s opportunity. And of course, it's also revenue for the capital projects that we so badly need.”

Though they performed in groups, the judges made it clear that all their critiques would be based on individual performances. Rita, Lemon and Jimbo were all declared safe, leaving seven other girls on stage to hear from the panel. Among the bottom were Kiara who took heat for fading into the background and not getting creative enough with her outfits, Tynomi who was acknowledged for great dancing but also didn't know the words to her own song and had a very basic look, Anastarzia whose runway look confused the heck out of the judges and for failing to loosen up in the dancing, and Ilona who was uncomfortable in the performance challenge but they thought looked expensive and polished on the runway. On the top were BOA who was called a stand out and whose outfit shouldn't have worked but did, Priyanka who was loved as a performer and for an impeccably styled outfit, and Scarlett who they thought made the most of a weave dress and who finally showed her personality in the challenge.

A pair of Heart O’North stalwarts depart however as Hayward leaves for the Great Northern Conference and Ladysmith heads to the Lakeland. Both schools had been a part of the league for football for at least 68 years prior to the move. Hayward had a 2019-20 school year enrollment size of 607 students when combined with nearby Lac Courte Oreilles, significantly larger than the next closest Heart O’North school Barron (419). The Hurricanes are the smallest school in the GNC based on those enrollment numbers, but are close in line with schools such as Medford (639) and Mosinee (626).
 Ladysmith (279) was the third smallest enrollment in the Heart O’North before the move, but now is second to Rib Lake/Prentice (287) and in front of Grantsburg (258) and Unity (255).
 Teams across the state will be in 8-team leagues, reserving the first two weeks of the year for nonconference games before seven league contests make up the remaining matchups of the 9-week regular season. With 10 teams in the conference last season, the Heart O’North played a full schedule of league games and Cumberland coach Corey Berghammer said the lack of nonconference matchups hurt HON teams during postseason seeding meetings.
 “I think it’s going to be better statewide for everybody and I’ll be honest with you, last year when we went to a seeding meeting it hurt us by not having nonconference games,” Berghammer said. “You wouldn’t think it would but we had no comparable to anybody else we sat in a room with in a seeding meeting. By us just being a conference – and it wasn’t just Cumberland – we kinda heard the same song and dance from everybody that were playoff eligible a little bit that was the one negative, us not having a nonconference schedule without comparables to anybody else that we sat in a room with.”
 Prior to Cameron and Saint Croix Falls joining in 2019, the Heart O’North had a two nonconference games to start its season and the league’s coaches are happy to return to that format.
 “I just think it’s going to be good to have it back to what we had a couple years ago where we knew (weeks) 3-9 we were going to be in conference games,” Berghammer said. “You know now you have to win this many conference games to get in and I think it’s going to be a very competitive league going forward.”
 With all leagues now having the ability to schedule nonconference games in the first two weeks, it has opened up some intriguing new series’ among teams in the area. Bloomer regains nonconference foe Somerset — a team the Blackhawks played early on each year from 2010-2018 — while also picking up Cloverbelt Conference powerhouse Eau Claire Regis in week two. Prior to 2019 the Blackhawks played Lakeland four years in a row, a school located two-and-a- half hours away in Minocqua.
 Cumberland and Spooner are looking to keep respective rivals Ladysmith and Hayward on the schedule for nonconference games while Saint Croix Falls was able to add close-in-proximity rivals Grantsburg and Unity, two schools the Saints battled when all three were a part of the Lakeland Conference.
 “I think playing Grantsburg and Unity is important for us, not only because of the proximity of the towns – we’re neighbors – and the rivalries will be able to continue on,” Belisle said. “We’ve played Grantsburg probably 100 times over the last 103 years. It’s important to keep that tradition going.”
 Cameron joined the Heart O’North Conference in all sports last season and Saint Croix Falls is doing the same this year.
 The move to the Heart O’North was important for Saint Croix Falls, a district that had quickly become the largest in its conference. The Saints finished 5-4 in the regular season and the program won its first playoff game in almost 30 years with a 35-21 victory at Elk Mound in the first round of the Division 5 playoffs.
 “It seemed like we could never get over the hump with a playoff victory and the last one (before 2019) was 1991. So last year’s playoff win – as silly as it sounds with maybe a program like Bloomer who wins two, three, four playoff games a year and some of these other programs – but for us that was a big deal and our kids are feeding off that,” Belisle said. “They know it can happen. They expect it to happen now.”
 How a fall football season will look remains up in the air amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. More is expected to be learned in the coming weeks as the WIAA is able to sketch out a clearer gameplan on how the fall might look.
 But the teams of the Heart O’North already have a leg up on others leagues and more than anything, are just hoping there will be games to be played.
 “Long story short for me, I’m glad we have games. I’m hoping we have a season and as everybody I’d like to get back to normal,” Post said.

Wednesday, Michigan reported the highest number of new cases of the disease since May — not quite two weeks after the Fourth of July weekend when hundreds of people across the state were seen in various videos congregating without taking any precautions.
 The state health department reported 891 new COVID-19 cases, the highest number since May 14. It also reported four more confirmed or probable deaths from the disease, raising the state’s death toll to 6,330.
 Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in a press conference, said she may be forced to reimpose some restrictions if the upward trajectory continues.
 Whitmer, a Democrat, said Michigan is at a “turning point” and “we’re trying to hold on to staying in phase four,” which most regions of the state are in right now. Under phase three, a stay-at-home order was in place. There would not be in-person instruction when K-12 schools reopen.
 Statewide there were about 71 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, which was a lower rate than in all but seven states. But Michigan’s seven-day case average as of Tuesday, 566, was up from the seven-day average of roughly 361 on June 30, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.
 Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II said it is easy to think that although Michigan is seeing an uptick, it is “out of the woods” compared to places like Texas and Florida.
 “But we’re not,” he said. “We need everybody to step up — wear a mask.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge has ruled that California residents can again legally buy foie gras, provided the product and transaction are made out of state, but they still can’t get the delicacy in restaurants. California’s ban on foie gras, the fattened liver of a duck or goose, was challenged in court by out-of-state producers who said they lost nearly one-third of their sales after the prohibition took effect. U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson ruled Tuesday the sale of foie gras doesn’t violate the law if the seller is outside of California and the product is given to a third-party delivery service and brought into the state. The ruling only applies to people who buy foie gras for individual consumption.

The added sun in the early afternoon will spike temperatures toward the upper 80s. That will also juice up the atmosphere, increasing the risk for additional scattered storms developing. Off and on rain and storms, some of which may be strong to severe will continue the rest of the afternoon and early evening. The primary threat will be storms capable of producing strong to severe wind gusts. There will be a lot of moisture in place and localized flash flooding will be possible with stronger storms likely to produce torrential rainfall. The good news on the flooding threat is these storms should be moving at a decent speed which helps keep them from dumping all the heavy rain over one area. Another variable we will be monitoring is the potential for rotating thunderstorms across the region. The tornado threat is slightly elevated with this system. While it isn't as high of a threat as the potential for severe thunderstorm wind gusts, the threat isn't zero either and all storms will be closely monitored by our team through the afternoon into the evening.

CARVER - School officials are working on a re-entry plan to prepare for an in- person return to school while meeting health and safety requirements, remote learning in two parts and a hybrid of the two.
 Superintendent Scott Knief said in a presentation to the School Committee last week that the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education wants school districts to submit one formal plan by July 31.
 "We're always adjusting to new information," he said, as he shared an outline of a reopening plan that he has also shared with the faculty of both Carver schools and also at a parent meeting attended by as many as 130 parents.
 He said so many parents wanted to be part of the process that he established a parent advisory subcommittee to meet on a weekly basis.
 The School Committee has committed to meeting at 7 p.m. Wednesday, July 29, through remote participation via Zoom to focus on reviewing the final re-entry plan to be presented to the state and making any final suggestions that could result in changes.
 Parents recently answered a survey about having their students return to school with health and safety requirements in place. He said he was not surprised by the results.
 Knief said of the 628 total responses, 68 percent said their students would return in the fall, 5 percent said no and 27 percent said they were unsure with not enough information or they don't know where they will be in six weeks.
 Eighty percent responded that they do not have health concerns in their family that would keep their students at home, and of the 20 percent who do, some would still send their students back.
 As for the hybrid option, Knief said one option is students returning to school half days every day, alternating days, two days in-person and three days remotely and then alternating weeks. He said half days every day was a first choice but ranked lower for another option.
 School Committee member Jenn Pratt said that as a parent she would prefer alternating weeks and knows teachers who also prefer that to half days based on the amount of quality teaching time balanced against maintaining sanitary conditions. Knief said it will be a priority to keep students in the same family on the same schedule.
 Knief expects to ask parents to a respond to a few more surveys, with the final survey asking parents to formally commit to sending their students back to school or providing them with a remote learning opportunity.
 "Right now we're thinking that this kind of model would be some sort of an online learning platform," he said.
 School Committee member Jason Greenwood was concerned about how the district will reach out to parents about the reopening plan. Knief said he hopes to schedule public hearing-type meetings for that purpose.
 Both schools will be required to have isolation rooms for students or staff with possible COVID-19 symptoms that are separate from the nurse's offices but that school nurses can access using the appropriate personal protective equipment.
 Knief said Carver Elementary has the available space and a new state-of-the- art ventilation system, but that's not the case at Carver Middle High School.
 School Committee member James O'Brien said not enough consideration is being given to the difficulties of talking with a mask on all day and he would support face shields as an option. He also worries about how students will catch up academically among the other challenges.
 "There are a lot of people really having a hard time with this," he said.
 One of the recommendations is that students eat in their classrooms. Knief said yes when School Committee Chairman Andy Cardarelli asked about opening windows and holding classes outdoors weather permitting as plausible options.
 Knief said efforts are underway to be able to meet social distancing requirements of at least three feet apart and all students facing forward, including purchasing new desks for kindergarten and first grade rather than sharing tables.
 He said that cost of the new desks and the remote learning platform for students who do not return to school may be covered by new funding announced by Gov. Charlie Baker. He said school districts will receive an additional $225 per pupil. He said that would mean approximately $360,000 for Carver.

  There were also cameos by a variety of NBC/Comcast stars, including Khloe Kardashian, Dwayne Johnson, Jimmy Fallon, Mandy Moore, Gwen Stefani and Al Roker.


  Notably, not all NBC affiliates were on board with the decision, with Vulture reporting that several opted not to air a telecast that they saw as a threat to their business -- encouraging people to watch a streaming service, at the risk of further cannibalizing the audience for traditional TV.


  The program will air again on NBCUniversal cable networks and online, but rest assured, nobody deprived the opportunity to watch missed much.


  As if anticipating the confusion, NBC put out a statement from sales chief Linda Yaccarino stressing that this was an unusual year, saying, "When future advertising history books are written, they'll show that today was _the_ day that NBCUniversal changed the Upfront forever."

Hair salons — businesses also ordered to shut down this week for the second time — are getting more vocal about their own resistance movement. A federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of hairstylists and salon owners against Newsom in May, alleging the governor had unfairly kept them closed. The lawsuit represented over 500,000 licensees via the Professional Beauty Federation of California.
 “There’s a lot of anger in our industry right now,” said Gayle Fulbright, owner of Headlines The Salon in Encinitas.
 Fulbright is closing her salon until she can get the green light from state regulators to operate outdoors. But she understands the urgency felt by her peers who feel closure is not an option.
 “We already lost three salons up here in North County during the last shut down,” Fulbright said. “I think some will take the risk or don’t care.”

The news of the killing of John the Baptist was devastating. John was a great prophet, loved and followed by multitudes from different layers of society. Even some of Jesus’ disciples were his previous disciples, and he led them to be the followers of Christ. As Jesus heard the news of John’s death, He fled to a desolate place. That is where he saw the crowds around him. They were probably mourning the death of this courageous man of God, whose truth telling cost him his life. Jesus showed compassion to the people. This is why he started to teach them and heal their sick, giving them comfort and illuminating them with his eternal teachings.

 As the group walked from the building, Simmons said the ministers' prayers offered hope to a community that's grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. She said she hopes people realize that God is not dead.
 "It's a scary time for a lot of people," she said.
