BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - A lot of people on social media are saying “show me the money!” when they hear about a possible stimulus check from the government.Congress is still working on details, but it sounds like the individuals could receive up to $1,200 and double that for married couples with hundreds more if you have kids.The Senate GOP's plan is a part of a trillion dollar plus bill to try and help the economy recover from coronavirus concerns. We're told the stimulus check would be based primarily on your 2018 tax returns.We asked financial expert Stewart Welch with the Welch Group about the impact this could have on families."This money is desperately needed. In fact, its needed now not two weeks from now which it looks like it may come out April 6th. Families are desperate. Layoffs are already happening. They're going to need the money to pay basic bills for basic essentials,” Welch said.The bill is also supposed to help small businesses, which as we’ve been reporting are trying to find creative ways to stay in business.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

Segundo balanço divulgado pela Secretaria Municipal da Agricultura, de julho de 2016 até meados deste mês, mais de 160 toneladas de frutas e legumes já haviam sido entregues pelos produtores como forma de contrapartida pelo apoio municipal. Ao oficializar os dados, o secretário da pasta, José Luiz Porto, assinalou que o programa tem promovido maior qualidade de vida no campo e na cidade. “Nosso agradecimento a todos os 296 produtores que fazem parte desta iniciativa. Um programa que nasceu através da vontade política do então prefeito Beto Preto e que tem tido continuidade com o prefeito Júnior da Femac, gerando renda na pequena propriedade, incentivando a fixação do homem no campo e também levado alimento saudável às nossas crianças da rede municipal e pessoas atendidas por entidades sociais de Apucarana”, observou Porto, relatando que além de milhares de mudas selecionadas de frutas, o programa também já distribuiu cerca de 4 mil toneladas de calcário e 150 toneladas de fosfato natural para fertilização do solo agrícola. “O “Terra Forte” tem cumprido muito bem com a sua missão”, disse.

Nevertheless, in the midst of one of the most volatile moments ever for the U.S. economy, Trump has wagered that his voice is the daily balm needed to soothe investor concerns.
 Over the course of the last eight days--all on which he held extended news conferences about the coronavirus response in the midst of trading -- his comments haven’t stopped the bleeding. The Dow has lost more than 17% since March 13, and has plummeted more than 34% since the market hit an all-time high Feb. 19.
 The president’s decision to offer daily affirmations to the health of the stock market, and the economy writ large, is not surprising. But no president has tied his fortunes to Wall Street more closely than Trump, who until the market crash bragged that the rising stock market was evidence of his success leading the economy.
 “Maybe, he should take it offline,”’ said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody Analytics. “But this president? He’s not going to do that.”
 Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush avoided talking about the stock market with substance, let alone trying to impact the market in the midst of trading. Bill Clinton took to heart his economic adviser Robert Rubin’s advice that markets go up and markets go down.
 Barack Obama was ridiculed as the stock-picker-in-chief less than two months into office when he suggested in the midst of a market slide that it was a good time to buy undervalued stocks.
 For much of his next six years in office, the 44th president was often measured when even talking about the improved health of the economy: his first term started in throes of the Great Recession but he left office with 75 straight months of job growth. By the latter part of his presidency, Obama began claiming credit for the bull market on occasion.
 “The stock market is booming,” Obama declared in a speech in a July 2014 speech in Kansas City.

Those close to Trump said he was fully aware that the coronavirus posed an enormous threat to the very same once-booming markets he touted as the calling card of his presidency, even as he was publicly downplaying concerns about the virus.
 In the weeks that the pandemic ballooned into a public health emergency, Trump had become increasingly frustrated as he privately expressed concerns to his advisers about the effect the virus could have on the markets and ultimately his reelection effort, according to White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing.
 Trump throughout his presidency has viewed the market’s performance as his “daily report card” of his job performance, Zandi said. With the pandemic thrusting the economy toward a recession, Zandi said that Trump now appears to be turning to the market for an “hourly report card” to gauge the effectiveness of his response.
 “In the past, sometimes it worked and sometimes it doesn’t,” Zandi said of the president’s years-long cheerleading of the market. “Recently, it hasn’t. He’s in fact, as of late, done less to instill confidence and more to upset investors. They don’t view his actions as very productive in terms of this crisis. It’s worked against him.”
 Throughout his presidency, Trump has used off-the-cuff diatribes to try to shame major, publicly-traded companies whose business dealings are at odds with his political interests, tapped out timely, friendly tweets about China’s Xi Jinping to calm market concerns about trade wars, and repeatedly berated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the central bank’s policies during market dips.
 Trump has repeatedly made clear that the battered market is top of his mind, as trillions of dollars in wealth and nearly all the gains for the Dow Jones Industrial tallied since his inauguration have been erased. He has sought to will a comeback with his daily updates about his administration’s efforts to contain the virus in the midst of trading day, Zandi said.
 It mostly hasn’t worked.
 Trump held a Rose Garden press conference on March 13, just before the New York Stock Exchange closed for the weekend, to declare a national emergency, to announce greater availability of virus testing kits were in the pipeline, and to declare he was ordering the purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

BEIJING (AP) — As the fight against a new virus shifts to Europe and beyond, China is supplying millions of masks and other desperately needed items to struggling governments, hoping to build political ties and defuse criticism that it allowed the disease to spread early on. Serbia's president plans to be at the airport this weekend to welcome a shipment of medical supplies from his \"brother and friend,\" Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Xi's government has flown gloves and protective clothing to Liberia. It is sending 100,000 test kits to the Philippines. More than 10 flights carrying millions of masks and other supplies are bound for the Czech Republic this week. China, said Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, is “the only country capable of supplying Europe with such amounts.” It’s part of an effort by the Communist Party to reshape the narrative, from one of early missteps to a nation that acted decisively to bring the outbreak under control. China is touting its deliveries of ventilators and masks overseas and dispatching its medical experts to share the lessons of its success. China hopes to benefit from a realization in the West of how difficult it is to bring the virus under control, said Julian Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University in New York. “The Chinese government's failures ... will be less harshly viewed in light of the failures of other governments to respond effectively as well,\" he said. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic blasted the European Union and praised China for offering help when he announced a state of emergency to combat the outbreak. His country wants to join the EU, but his government has moved closer to Russia and China in a seesaw battle for influence. “I believe in my brother and friend Xi Jinping and I believe in China’s...
