Comfort is a key consideration when wearing knee pads, and the only way to put this to the test is to use all the pads on all-day trail rides, involving extensive climbing and descending. During test rides we made a note of any chaffing or soreness, especially at the back of the knee, and whether the pad stayed in place or needed constant adjustment. We also kept an eye on durability because pulling the pads on and off can put extra stress on the lightweight material, especially at the upper seam. Obviously crashing can damage the face fabric but we accepted a certain amount of wear and tear in this area.

The plastic construction is a little bit more flexible that the two above, so this guard should bend rather than break if you happen whack it in a crash. It’s also lighter, which won’t matter when it’s clean, but you often gave a pound of mud sticking to a front mudguard, so every little helps.

These shoes are proof that snow boots can be stylish. My favorite thing about the Sorel Caribou Boot is how they look. They don’t scream in your face that they're snow boots, but they still function like them. Made of waterproof nubuck leather with a Sherpa pile snow cuff, they have a sleek and clean look to them that, I dare say, is fashionable. They’re easy to pair with snow pants or with jeans, and they're appropriate to wear whether you're running errands or dining out at a restaurant.

 # Kicker rejoins Fowlerville football 'family,' becomes big weapon
 Bill Khan
 Livingston Daily
 View Comments
 FOWLERVILLE — Morgyn Muck had a decision to make when he entered Fowlerville High School.
 He could stick with football, which he played since first grade, or he could focus on soccer, which he considers his strongest sport.
 Muck chose soccer, a decision he doesn’t regret in the least. A goalkeeper who saw lots of action in three varsity seasons, Muck is considering several college soccer offers.
 Still, he missed playing football, missed the bond he developed in eight years playing with a group that had success at every level.
 “They’ve been my family for a long time,” said Muck, who was a running back and defensive end growing up.
 With one more chance to play football, Muck decided last December to try out for the team as a kicker and punter while remaining on the soccer team.
 “I was going to come out last year, but I hesitated a little bit, so I didn’t show up,” he said. “This year I knew, ‘Hey, it’s my senior year. I don’t know what’s going to happen with COVID. I’ve just got to step it up and I’ve got to come out here and try out for the team.’ ”
 Muck’s return to football has been a huge benefit for the Gladiators, who will travel to Mason for a second-round state playoff game at 7 p.m. Friday.
 Two missed extra points (one blocked) in a 13-12 loss to Flint Powers Catholic last year were all that separated Fowlerville from a district championship and trip to the third round of the playoffs.
 With Muck on board, the kicking game is no longer a concern for the Gladiators. It has, in fact, become a strength.
 “Very reliable,” Fowlerville coach Jon Fletcher said. “He’s been very accurate. He has good distance with his field goal kicks, so that’s been really nice to have.”
 Muck boomed a 44-yard field goal with 17 seconds left to give Fowlerville a 17-14 victory over Holt on Oct. 2. In last week’s 10-0 playoff victory over Haslett, a 22-yard field goal late in the first half was the only score in the game until Adam Simon provided a cushion with a touchdown run in the fourth quarter.
 Muck is 3-for-4 on field goals and 9-for-9 on extra points this season.

 Muck relishes being in a position to determine the outcome of games, whether it’s as the last line of defense on a soccer field or as a player called upon to win or lose a game with his right foot.
 “I love the pressure,” he said. “I’ve dealt with it my whole life. I’m one of the coolest people in that position. I don’t stress. I don’t overthink anything. I have a job to do. I’ll get it done.”

The PRO Tharsis XC is a solid option if you are looking to go carbon for your XC or trail bike. At 740mm, the extra width improves stability and handling compared to a typical XC oriented handlebar. For most XC environments, especially longer marathon type events, the additional comfort far outweighs the occasional woolly response.

The overall fit of the Sam Hill is super snug and I never had to pull it up once while riding. 7idp is offering the Sam Hill in four sizes and with the silicone/mesh back it’s dead easy to pull on. This mesh also seems a lot more durable – a lot of lightweight knee pads I’ve tested eventually rip at the calf as you pull them on and off.

In addition, to derive Adjusted EBITDA _re_ , excluding noncontrolling interest we exclude the noncontrolling partner's pro rata share of the net (income) loss allocated to the Hilton San Diego Bayfront partnership, as well as the noncontrolling partner's pro rata share of any EBITDA _re_ and Adjusted EBITDA _re_ components. We also exclude the noncash expense incurred with the amortization of deferred stock compensation as this expense is based on historical stock prices at the date of grant to our corporate employees and does not reflect the underlying performance of our hotels. In addition, we exclude the amortization of our right-of-use assets and liabilities as these expenses are based on historical cost accounting and do not reflect the actual rent amounts due to the respective lessors or the underlying performance of our hotels. Additionally, we include an adjustment for the cash finance lease expenses recorded on the ground lease at the Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles (prior to the hotel's sale in October 2019) and the building lease at the Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile. We determined that both of these leases are finance leases, and, therefore, we include a portion of the lease payments each month in interest expense. We adjust EBITDA _re_ for these two finance leases in order to more accurately reflect the actual rent due to both hotels' lessors in the current period, as well as the operating performance of both hotels. We also exclude the effect of gains and losses on the disposition of undepreciated assets because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA _re_ , excluding noncontrolling interest is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets.

To really batten down the hatches some knee pads have an additional Velcro strap, either at the top or bottom. Look for a long strip of Velcro and a strap that doesn’t bunch up or narrow as you pull it tight, which can cause it to dig in.

He also added that the movie has been in the works for a long time. "This movie is historical," he said. "David and Lyn have been working on this for 20 years. It wasn't supposed to be released five years ago. It was not supposed to be released 10 years ago. It was supposed to be released now, and historically we are supported. We are backed up, and this movie is going to be a success not only because of the messages and the acting and the music and the design but because we need it."

The company witnessed more stable consumption and retailer order patterns in the quarter, which along with the current trends form the basis for management’s fiscal 2021 guidance. In fiscal 2021, the company anticipates revenues of $925 million, based on anticipations of growth in most key brands. This is expected to be partly countered by pandemic-led impacts on consumer behavior and demand in certain categories. Adjusted earnings per share are envisioned to be nearly $3.18 for the fiscal. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.15, currently. In fiscal 2020, Prestige Consumer’s top and bottom lines came in at $963 million and $2.96 per share, respectively.      Free cash flow is anticipated to be $207 million or more in fiscal 2021.      Management remains focused on strengthening its brand portfolio to drive sales. These efforts, together with a strong financial status and efficient capital allocation, are expected to drive top and bottom-line growth in the long term.      This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 16.1% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 4.9%.

This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have based these forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business, results of operations, or financial condition and expectations regarding our liquidity position and our continued compliance with the terms of the Company's credit facility on our current expectations about future events. These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, intentions, financial condition, results of operations, future performance, and business, including but not limited to the potential benefits of the Combination, the impacts on our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and any projected global economic rebound or anticipated positive results due to Company actions taken in response to the pandemic, and our current and future results and plans and statements that include the words "may," "could," "should," "would," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "plan" or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements. A major risk is that demand for the Company's products and services is largely derived from the demand for its customers' products, which subjects the Company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer's business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns. Other major risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the primary and secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken in response to the pandemic by various governments, which could exacerbate some or all of the other risks and uncertainties faced by the Company, including the potential for significant increases in raw material costs, supply chain disruptions, customer financial stability, worldwide economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, significant changes in applicable tax rates and regulations, future terrorist attacks and other acts of violence. Furthermore, the Company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel, automobile, aircraft, industrial equipment, and durable goods manufacturers. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business will depend on, among other things, the extent, duration and strength of the resurgence of the pandemic, the severity of the disease and the number of people infected with the virus, the continued uncertainty regarding widespread availability of a vaccine, the effects on the economy by the pandemic, including the resulting market volatility, and by the measures taken by governmental authorities and other third parties restricting day-to-day life and business operations and the length of time that such measures remain in place, and governmental programs implemented to assist businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Other factors could also adversely affect us, including those related to the Combination and other acquisitions and the integration of the combined company as well as other acquired businesses. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about the Company and its operations that are subject to change based on various important factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties, and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. All forward-looking statements included in this press release, including expectations about the improvements in business conditions during the remainder of 2020 and future periods, are based upon information available to the Company as of the date of this press release, which may change. Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. For more information regarding these risks and uncertainties as well as certain additional risks that we face, refer to the Risk Factors section, which appears in Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2020, as well as in Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in our other reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to, and we disclaim any duty or obligation to, update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or future events or for any other reason. This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
