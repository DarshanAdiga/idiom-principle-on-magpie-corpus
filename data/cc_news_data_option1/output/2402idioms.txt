The disruption from coronavirus is not the only thing Serbia's parliamentary election has in common with the restart of the English Premier League.
 An outcome that is beyond serious doubt is the other.
 But while Liverpool FC should shortly confirm their first title in 30 years, Aleksandar Vucic would simply be extending a dominant run which already stretches back the best part of a decade.
 Serbia's president started his winning run in 2012 - when his Progressive Party (SNS) became the senior partner in a governing coalition. His official title was deputy prime minister, but it was clear from the start that Mr Vucic was running the show.
 But despite his successes, the president's past means that a significant proportion of Serbians will never accept him as their leader. Mr Vucic served as information minister in the ruinous regime of Slobodan Milosevic - the president who presided over the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. His subsequent apologies and conversion to a pro-EU policy cut no ice with critics.

Systemic racism in our country is epidemic. Reflecting on the protesting in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, I believe, I hope, we are at an inflection point where as a country we have the opportunity to cleanse old wounds of prejudice, racism and bigotry and take a giant step forward towards racial equality. An opportunity for meaningful reform of racially biased policing, racial bias in our criminal justice system, racial inequality in education, health care and opportunity. We have come together as a country willing to suffer hardship to battle the coronavirus pandemic.
 We are now also called upon to to heal deep wounds, to eradicate the scourge of racism. Healing infection requires deep cleansing. Deep cleansing requires that each of us, each person, each institution, each community address our own history of racism so that we can heal our past responsibly. Healing our society begins with honesty and truthfulness without judgement or condemnation. To accept the truth of our racist, prejudiced past followed by a willingness to make it right. This is sunlight for the soul.
 My story
 I grew up in Marblehead, the second child of first generation Jewish immigrants. My mom grew up in Swampscott, her father one of the first Jews to move to the North Shore. Dad grew up in Malden, his mother and father emigrated from Ukraine around 1915.
 In 1953, my parents purchased a classic Tudor style family home on Glendale Road near Glover School and we became a Marblehead family, sort of. As a young boy in the late 50's and early 60's, growing up in what was called Clifton, we lived in a predominantly Jewish sub community of Marblehead. Clifton was a train stop on the railroad line coming into town, almost Marblehead.
 My dad was active in the Jewish community. He and my mom were an active social couple, most of their friends were Jewish and they socialized around Jewish community events, a dance at Temple Sinai, a Sunday afternoon swim at JCC pool. Dad was deeply committed to providing for his family through education and opportunity. In spite of his business success and community leadership, he carried an unsettled fear of the depression and a cautiousness born of childhood poverty and the holocaust. He did not want to relive his past.
 Occasionally, we ventured downtown to The Warwick Theater for a Saturday afternoon matinee. Once or twice during the summer, we would go to old town for ice cream or to The Barnacle for blueberry cobbler. Old town was a different world.
 Two worlds
 I remember a sense of people from downtown as different, working class, rougher, a little scary, not Jewish. They were an "other," separate from my Clifton community. I didn't know anybody from downtown until I went to Junior High in seventh grade.
 For the first 12 years of my life, I lived with the belief I was different from them, that I wasn't part of their world and they weren't part of mine. Subtly, I had internalized that we were different and somehow better. I had learned a particular type of prejudice growing up in Marblehead. It went both ways.
 As a child, I was aware of anti-Jewish sentiment in the larger community of our town. Jews were not welcome at the Eastern Yacht Club, Corinthian Yacht Club, Boston Yacht Club, Tedesco Country Club or the Swampscott Beach Club and we were most certainly not welcome to reside on Marblehead Neck. It was common knowledge that realtors would not show property on the Neck to Jewish families.
 As the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 and I studied for my Bar Mitzvah, Jews were not welcome at most of Marblehead's established institutions. The elders of the Jewish community wanted their children and families to have equal opportunity in education and athletics so they set out to build their own institutions, three Temples, the JCC, a day school, a yacht club and a country club open to Jews.
 As a teenager, I was told that it was not acceptable to marry a non-Jewish girl and therefore, we should not date non-Jewish girls because we all know how one thing leads to another. The reasons why our parents felt strongly about this reinforced the notion that we were different and that gentiles were somehow less than. Prejudice, racism, pure and simple.
 The chosen ones?
 I remember a Passover Seder in my childhood home having an intense debate about the notion of the Jews as "God's Chosen People." My father argued for the truth that the old testament in the Book of Deuteronomy asserts that the Jews are chosen by God for some higher purpose. I objected strongly to this idea of being chosen.
 "What about Christians, Hindus or Muslims?" I asked. "Are they not chosen? How does this idea of being "chosen" encourage anti semitism? How does it effect how others see us and how we see others?"
 I wanted to understand. Racism and prejudice runs deep in Marblehead.
 I remember, as a child, a school trip to Old Burial Hill. Our teacher showed us the grave of Black Joe, buried separate from the community outside of the cemetery proper.
 "Black Joe was a negro," she explained. "He fought in the Revolutionary War and was a tavern keeper for many years. There is a pond named for him where the tavern still stands to this day."
 Today he'd be considered an essential person, but was not welcome into his community burial ground. He was allowed to be nearby, but never fully included, even in death. I wonder, today, how it came to pass he wasn't allowed to be buried with his friends and neighbors. Perhaps the opposite was true, that his burial nearby was an act of progressive grace. He was almost allowed in. I want to understand.
 Ruffling feathers
 I realize this may be upsetting. You may be asking yourself, why dredge this up now? Now is a perfect time to ask ourselves questions, to embrace our histories honestly, transparently, without judgement. Prejudice is a common human trait. It arises from fear and can be healed through deep remembering, honest reflection and the willingness to right old wrongs. We have a lot of work to do and each of us has a role to play. It is not sufficient to say, "I am not racist." We must be "anti racist."
 My wife first came to Marblehead in fall of 1972. She was born in Vermont, but moved to New Jersey as a young teenager and attended a diverse mixed race high school.
 "When I first met you, I knew you were prejudiced. You had grown up in a sheltered community with no exposure to people of other backgrounds and faiths. You had strong opinions about everyone. It was a subtle form of bigotry, an attitude, you weren't hateful at all, but you definitely expressed your prejudice in the way you spoke of 'others' whether they be Christians, Blacks or other ethnic minorities. It was shocking for me."
 It was the beginning of a long learning path. My best friend in junior high was the child of Greek immigrants. I loved going to their church for traditional Greek dancing.
 We can effect transformative change, we can heal old wounds and past trauma if we are willing to do the work.
 Facing facts
 It's not easy to be honest with myself. Much easier to be aware of the defects of others than my own, of prejudiced attitudes and beliefs of others than my own. I have a clear sense of what others need to do to combat racism and bigotry, it's much harder for me to be aware of what I need to do.
 What actions will I take to be anti racist? We will heal if we do the hard work of self reflection, truth and reconciliation. It will be an ongoing process and will take many years, but the ripple effect of each of us being responsible for our own prejudices will be powerful from the start. There are policies to be enacted, laws to be passed and leadership changes to be made, but without deep cleansing on the part of each of us our predilection towards prejudice will remain.
 We can become a kinder more compassionate, more equitable society if we are willing. I, for one, am willing.

Bloomberg) -- Top managers at infrastructure giant Atlantia SpA have appealed to the European Commission to urgently intervene in a clash with the Italian government, accusing Rome of weakening the company’s highway unit “for political ends,” according to the text of a letter seen by Bloomberg.
 The letter sent last week, signed by Atlantia Chairman Fabio Cerchiai and Chief Executive Officer Carlo Bertazzo, marks an escalation in a long-running tussle between the Benetton family-owned holding, which controls toll-road operator Autostrade per l’Italia SpA, and the government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
 The managers’ letter to Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis says “prompt European Commission intervention” is a matter of urgency. “The survival of the company itself” is at stake, it says.
 Negotiations between the government and the Benettons to resolve the dispute over toll-road licenses are at an impasse, with little sign of a solution ahead of an end-June deadline.
 Conte has threatened to strip Autostrade of its highway concession in the wake of a deadly 2018 bridge collapse, though he’s aware this could start a long and potentially costly litigation process.
 A spokesman for the Commission confirmed that the letter is currently being examined and a reply will be sent in due time.
 A spokesman for Atlantia declined to comment on the letter. Conte’s office and the Transport Ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The Financial Times reported earlier Thursday on the letter.
 Measures taken by Italian authorities are harming Autostrade, the highway sector and investors, according to the letter, calling the situation “a serious violation of the principles of business freedom and internal market rules.”
 Credit Ratings
 Atlantia has taken issue with rule changes approved by the government which cut financial penalties for revoking concessions. They charge that the new rules hurt Atlantia and Autostrade’s credit ratings.
 In the letter, the company’s managers also accuse the government of cutting off access for Autostrade, also known as Aspi, to state guarantees that help firms cope with the impact of the coronavirus.
 “This is patently discriminatory, confirming the Italian authorities’ desire to compromise Aspi’s viability, weaken the company and reduce its value for political ends,” the letter states.
 While Atlantia has said it would welcome a new minority stakeholder, Italian state infrastructure fund F2i SGR SpA has been pushing to acquire control, with state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA also possibly taking a stake, according to people familiar with the talks.
 The letter also denounces a reported government proposal to have Atlantia sell its majority stake in Autostrade to Cassa Depositi, known as CDP, and other funds. That plan, reported by several Italian news organizations, has not been officially confirmed.
 “The government itself is trying to force Atlantia to sell its majority stake to state-owned CDP at a reduced value, creating significant damage to thousands of Italian and foreign investors,” the letter said.
 June 30 is the last day Autostrade can hand back its license and sue the government, following the government’s changes to concession rules late last year.
 Conte will have to balance the demands of his coalition partners, with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement eager to show that those responsible for the bridge accident have been punished and the Democratic Party wary of potential economic impact.

While many other copies of the order exist, the current national reckoning over racial injustice compelled staff at the U.S. National Archives to delve into the stacks and search for the original document.
 "Based on what's going on now in this country, there was a need to talk about Juneteenth, the freeing of enslaved people in 1865," says Michael Smith, a public affairs specialist at the Archives. "I was curious to know if we had the actual document of General Order No. 3 in our holdings."
 So Smith reached out Trevor Plante, who directs the Archives' textual records division. Plante found that the order was issued by the district of Texas, which helped him locate that command's order book — used as the official record of orders issued.
 Plante found that book yesterday in the stacks of the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C., and located the now-famous order within — handwritten by the major general's aide, F.W. Emery, and still in good condition. It bears the number three because it was just the third order that Granger had issued since taking over the Texas command.
 In 1865, the book was in Galveston, then the Union Army's headquarters for the district of Texas. Later on, Plante says, it would have been sent to the War Department in Washington, D.C., and then on to the National Archives, where it has been since probably the 1940s, available for researchers to request and peruse.
 With the document's fresh resurgence, it will now be digitized and added to the Archives' catalog, as well as highlighted on the National Archives and Records Administration's African American history page. The Archives' museum and buildings are currently closed to the public and its in-person services suspended, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 But in the future, there may be keen interest in viewing the physical version of Order No. 3.
 Christopher Wilson, who leads the African American history program at the National Museum of American History, points to the last time the original Emancipation Proclamation went on tour outside D.C. For conservation reasons, the original can only be displayed for a few days at a time under extremely low light — and he says people lined up at museums across the country to catch a glimpse, even at two in the morning.
 "I think it's wonderful that we have found [Order No. 3] and it can be added to the understanding of the end of slavery, because I think there is such a misunderstanding around how that happened and who motivated it to happen," Wilson says.
 When people learn history via a public holiday, he says, the story often becomes simplified.
 Juneteenth is not about enslaved African Americans being "told they were free," he argues — but about power moving slowly, the agency of African Americans to gain liberty, and the need to back up justice with action.
 General Order No. 3 is a part of that more complicated history, even with its less-than-poetic words — the dry legality is partly what makes the order so meaningful, Wilson says.
 "Just to see what was looked upon by our ancestors as this evidence that _finally_ the weight of federal authority, the weight of everything that the United States had promised to people, was finally showing up in black and white."

Editor's Note: The following was submitted by St. Dunstan's Episcopal Church in Dover.
 While the state has given houses of worship the green light to resume in- person services, St. Dunstan's Episcopal Church in Dover will not be holding services at the church for the time being. Per the Diocese of Massachusetts, Episcopal churches are to remain online until such a time that the safety and health of all can be ensured.
 "We obviously miss seeing one another and celebrating our faith communally," said Rev. Sean T. Leonard, rector, St. Dunstan's, "but our primary call as Christians is to love our neighbors, and we cannot do that if we are putting people at risk. While not the same as meeting in-person, our online Sunday services are well-attended, and we are still coming together in community and celebrating what we hold dear. "
 St. Dunstan's holds a service of Morning Prayer each Sunday at 10 a.m. For the Zoom link, please email Fr. Sean at revsean@saintdunstansma.org. A video of the service is posted on the church website and Facebook page each week so that it may be watched at any time.

This year's EA Play was one of the most underwhelming presentations I believe I've seen in my 13 years of covering gaming. I'm excited that there's a new Skate title on the way and Star Wars: Squadrons looks excellent. But this didn't feel like the EA Play events I've come to know over the years. It felt incomplete, as if there were major titles ripped from the lineup at the last minute. Surely a major publisher like EA has something more robust in the works. I refuse to believe this is all the company has up its sleeve, and if that is the case, we're in for a pretty generic crop of titles. I'm just having trouble believing this is what EA had planned for people to enjoy in tandem with physical E3 2020 visits this summer. How boring.

NEW YORK/BANGALORE -- L'Oreal SA , Unilever and other multinationals that acquired personal-care brands founded by Black people are moving to reassure their core customers, some of whom have pledged in the wake of racial-justice protests to direct their spending toward only Black-owned companies.
 L'Oreal's multicultural beauty brand Carol's Daughter, which was founded by a Black woman in her Brooklyn kitchen in 1993 and named for her mother, said June 10 that it wanted to "clear some things up" when it posted a message to its Instagram page.
 "Carol's Daughter is Black-founded, and Black-led, and joined the L'Oreal family of brands in 2014," it said. Founder Lisa Price "is still actively involved in all aspects of the business; leading the brand's product development and creative vision," the statement said.
 Price is senior vice president and creative director at Carol's Daughter, which is part of the Multi-Cultural Beauty Division at L'Oreal USA, and is also part of the Executive Committee at L'Oreal USA.
 Multinational companies in recent years have snapped up products aimed at Black consumers and marketed those brands as authentically Black, with homemade formulas, personalized offers and feel-good marketing. But in the wake of the protests following the May 25 death of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, many consumers are pledging to purchase more goods from Black- owned businesses as a way to bring greater racial equity.
 SheaMoisture, a personal care company founded in Harlem by Liberian immigrants in 1991, became part of Unilever in 2017 after the Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever purchased Sundial Brands, a New York-based beauty firm. Black consumers threatened to boycott its products in June citing its corporate ownership.
 On June 9, Cara Sabin, CEO of Sundial Brands, which operates as a standalone unit within Unilever, posted a message on Instagram to assuage them. "I am a Black CEO, in White corporate America, leading a brand that exists to serve our Black consumer," Sabin wrote.
 Black spending power in the United States is expected to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2021, from about $1.3 trillion last year, according to a report by Nielsen, a data analytics firm that tracks consumer purchases. The Black community makes up 13.4% of the U.S. population, and outspends in relation to other groups on products such as hair care and beauty, and women's fragrances. In 2017, for example, Black shoppers represented 85% of the $63 million total U.S. industry spend on multicultural hair care products.
 The group also represented 22.4% and 21% of the total U.S industry spending on women's fragrances and feminine hygiene products that year, respectively, the report showed.
 Sales of hair care products targeted at multi-ethnicities were up 50% year- over-year in the month to May 17, according to Strategic Solutions International, a unit of Nielsen. Black-owned hair care companies represented 14% of the category, but drove 20% of that growth at retail stores.
 But some consumers say they're paying closer attention to the ownership of a variety of goods and services aimed at Blacks, including bookstores, restaurants and pharmacies. On fundraising site GoFundMe, there are nearly 2,000 pages set up in support of Black-owned businesses, the majority of which were all created in recent weeks.
 "We've been dealing with these issues with Black people for how long, right? But there's just something about this moment," said Vivian Duker, a Baltimore- based corporate attorney. Earlier this month, she teamed up with a friend to launch a Change.org campaign called "#VERIFYBLACK" that has garnered more than 7,000 signatures. The petition seeks to get social media platforms to identify Black-owned businesses more clearly.
 Brands such as Carol's Daughter and SheaMoisture would not qualify as Black- owned businesses, she told Reuters.
 Unilever and L'Oreal did not respond to requests for comment.
 Procter & Gamble in 2018 acquired Walker & Co, the parent company of Bevel, a men's grooming line, and Form Beauty, a women's haircare line - both primarily for people of color. Walker & Co Vice President of Marketing Tia Cummings told Reuters that being part of P&G helped widen the availability of its products, making it easier for men and women to find and purchase them.
 Dana Williams-Johnson, Instructor in the Howard University School of Business Marketing Department said companies "making money off of Black consumers should have leadership that reflects the consumers that purchase the brands."
 "How diverse are these company's boards? How many Black people are at the top with a seat at the boardroom table? How much do all these brands truly value the Black dollar? Those will be the questions that need answers next," she added.
 According to Black Enterprise magazine, 187 of the S&P 500 companies did not have a single Black member on their boards in 2019.
 Haircare company Cantu Beauty faced such questions on Instagram this month, with some shoppers noting it was sold to PDC Brands in 2015 and declaring they would boycott the brand in favor of Black-owned businesses.
 So the company hosted an Instagram livestream chat "with the people behind the brand" on June 12. "I want to pull back that curtain and let you guys see exactly what is going on behind the scenes," Cantu Beauty's Global Vice President Dametria Mustin said during the livestream.
 PDC Brands did not respond to requests for comment.
 Synthea Hairston, 24, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania called Cantu her "number 1" brand for many years. But she refuses to shop the brand again.
