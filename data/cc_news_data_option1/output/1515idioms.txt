The start of Bayern's six-week title celebrations got off to a stuttering start at the Allianz Arena on Saturday as Roberto Firmino netted the visitors' 63rd league goal of the season 15 minutes from time to end the Bavarians' 100 per cent home league record.
 Only Bayern have scored more than Hoffenheim in Germany's top flight this term, with Anthony Modeste giving the away side a shock lead midway through the first period.
 That only served to spark a much-changed Bayern into life, though, and a Claudio Pizarro brace and a strike from Xherdan Shaqiri in the space of nine minutes took Hoffenheim's tally of league goals conceded to 62 - extending their unwanted record of having the most porous defence in the division.
 However, Markus Gisdol's men reduced the arrears before the break courtesy of a superb Sejad Salihovic free-kick before snatching a deserved point as Firmino took his 14th Bundesliga goal of the season in stylish fashion.
 After clinching the title with Tuesday’s victory over Hertha Berlin, Pep Guardiola showed the vast array of quality within Bayern's squad as Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, David Alaba, Philipp Lahm, Toni Kroos, Arjen Robben and Thomas Muller formed arguably the strongest bench ever named ahead of the midweek UEFA Champions League trip to Manchester United.
 Despite the joyous mood in the Allianz Arena, it was the visitors who opened the scoring in a goal-laden first half.
 Modeste netted after 23 minutes as he latched onto a throughball, with Neuer’s back-up Tom Starke - playing against his former club - unable to keep the forward’s low effort out despite getting a hand to it.
 The hosts were not behind long, though, as Pizarro levelled eight minutes later.
 The Peruvian, who had already seen a shot well saved, met a right-wing cross from Shaqiri and flicked his header into the back of the net.
 Bayern then turned on the style with two goals in six minutes to take control of the game.
 Shaqiri put the champions ahead after Pizarro controlled a Rafinha cross perfectly for the Switzerland international to fire beyond Jens Grahl.
 And a lightning quick counter-attack five minutes before the break led to Bayern's third. Two passes released Franck Ribery on the left, and he delivered the perfect cross for Pizarro to grab his second.
 The first-half action was still not over, however, as Hoffenheim cut the deficit through Salihovic, the Bosnia-Herzegovina international curling a free-kick over the wall and into the top corner from 20 yards.
 After such an action-packed opening 45 minutes, the second was quiet in comparison as neither side created a chance of note until Shaqiri wasted a perfect Ribery cross on the hour, the winger firing over with an acrobatic volley.
 And Bayern were made to rue that miss as Firmino levelled with 15 minutes to play, the 22-year-old firing low past Starke to become just the third team to avoid defeat against Guardiola's team in the league this term.
 Substitute Robben missed a late chance to snatch Bayern's 20th straight Bundesliga win, before Starke was called into action to deny Sebastian Rudy.
 Guardiola will now anxiously await news on Thiago Alcantara's injury, which forced him off in the first half, before Bayern's visit to Old Trafford.

Georgia Power announced it's reducing the workforce at Plant Vogtle due to the impact the coronavirus has had on workers.
   
 In a Thursday release, spokesperson John Kraft said project management has asked for an approximate 20% reduction to the craft workforce through a self- selection process. A number of workers have already chosen to stay off-site during the pandemic.
   
 As of Wednesday, 42 workers had tested positive, with 57 workers awaiting test results and and 154 testing negative.
   
 "The mitigating action is expected to help increase workforce productivity and reduce absenteeism," Kraft said in a release. "It is also intended to help lessen the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce by allowing for increased social distancing and further facilitating the latest recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
   
 Kraft said a reduction of staff was expected as unit 3 nears completion, but the action to reduce the workforce will cause the project to "accelerate the transition to a more streamlined workforce for the time being".
   
 Vogtle 3 and 4 is currently the largest jobs-producing construction project in Georgia, and had more than 9,000 workers on site, and more than 800 permanent jobs available once the units begin operating.
   
 Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Co., and has the largest ownership share in Vogtle, said last month the project was approximately 84% complete.
   
 Unit 3 is expected to be in service in late 2021, and unit 4 in late 2022.

With local businesses scaling back or shutting down during the coronavirus outbreak, the city of Bastrop is looking for ways to weather an expected sales tax revenue shortfall.
   
 Currently, the city is projecting a $640,000 decrease in sales tax revenue after local and state disaster declarations were issued in March and Gov. Greg Abbott ordered restaurants and bars to close their dining rooms and change operations to carry-out and delivery only.
   
 Sales tax revenue accounts for 42% of the city's general fund. The city expected to collect just over $5 million in sales tax revenue this fiscal year, according to the city's budget.
   
 With the expected plummet in sales tax revenue combined with other revenue shortfalls, the economic downturn is estimated to cost the city's general fund $760,000, said Chief Financial Officer Tracy Waldron.
   
 "This is an estimate, this is a projection, this is my best guess as to what our shortfall will be," Waldron told the City Council on Tuesday night. "We will be updating this every month as we go along. I don't want you to hold me to this number because this number is literally going to change every time I update the spreadsheet."
   
 Bastrop Interim City Manager Robert Wood recently sent an email to all city departments asking each director to identify ways in which they can save, Waldron said.
   
 Seven areas of savings have so far been identified. The largest savings will come from a hiring freeze for the city's 12 vacant positions, including the planning director and public safety director. This move alone could save the city over $500,000, Waldron said.
   
 The hiring freeze does not include a full-time city manager, for whom the city is continuing an ongoing search.
   
 City Manager Lynda Humble abruptly resigned in January after management disagreements with the City Council. Interim City Manager Robert Wood was hired last month to fill in while the city searches for a full-time manager.
   
 The city is also implementing other cost saving measures, including suspending payments to its vehicle and equipment replacement fund, deferring loan payments to Bastrop Power and Light from its innovation fund, and holding off on upgrading its website -- amounting to $378,108 in savings, Waldron said.
   
 Other ideas for future savings include transferring available funds from the city's innovation fund to its general fund, finding other line item savings from its general fund, and reducing its travel and training budgets. It's not yet clear how much the city stands to save in these areas.
   
 "With all of that, we feel confident that we can weather the storm and we're going to end the fiscal year still in the positive," Waldron said.
   
 City staff will also examine how the coronavirus outbreak will impact revenue from hotel occupancy taxes.
   
 "We know that we may have some hard decisions ahead of us, but the fact of the matter is we don't really know what that final number is going to be," said Bastrop Mayor Connie Schroeder.

Back in January I wrote a column that pointed out any history class in our schools is forced, by its very nature, to be a broad general discussion of a multitude of facts.
 I wasn’t trying to be critical, not at all. History classes are very different from classes like math or science, where facts are the central focus. History classes have to take a mass of names, dates, places, events, and numbers, and condense them into a broad general view of the past, focusing mainly on issues and outcomes.
 As I’m sure you know, if you ever ran into a history teacher who adopts the terrible error of focusing on names, dates, places, and so on, thereby filling his or her teaching with questions of fact, quickly loses the interest of his students. Why? Focusing on facts turns what can be a highly interesting and illuminating subject into one of pointless memorization.
 I had one of those teachers during my junior year in high school; he taught American history, turning it into the most thoroughly hated subject in the whole school. He rarely if ever spoke. Every day — every single day! — he passed out worksheets and we sat there filling them out. His tests, used over and over each year, were masses of questions about minor facts, and were just as boring and useless as he was.
 Later in life, while stationed in England, where I had a great time teaching others how to teach, I had the privilege of taking history classes, including American history classes, from Professor Malcolm Robinson of King’s College, Oxford. What a difference! What an immense difference!
 Dr. Robinson showed us that the importance of the facts of history is that they show us why events took the turns and twists they do, which — in turn — teaches us something about our ancestors, ourselves, and the beliefs, which underlie and control the flow of history.
 Yes, we study history to avoid a painful truth: Those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them.
 Recently, while reading a book about the Civil War, I was appalled by the casualty numbers in some of our Civil War battles. At Gettysburg, for example, three of the Union units suffered 72%, 76%, and 82% casualties.
 However, I was even more appalled by a chapter on flag bearers, where I read of soldier after soldier, some of them still just boys, dying one after the other as they bent down under fire, wrested their flag from dead hands, and were cut down by bullets after just another few steps. I was sorely troubled as I read of one case where six young men in a row died that way.
 And then, as I read on, I realized something that explained why men die to “save the flag.”
 I realized that if those six men had been Bob Pray, Earle LaFlamme, Rod McLeod, Steve Wawerczyk, Ray Collechia and Aaron Kahn, six of the men I served with side by side for three years in my first Air Force outfit, I had no doubt that I would have lifted that precious bit of rag out of the bloodied soil of that raging battlefield even if I knew that I would join my friends in death by doing it.
 And so would you!
 Why?
 “... that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom ...”
 Abraham Lincoln, 1863

This focus on misinformation and accuracy is understandable. Accurate scientific information is key for meaningful public debate and decision- making. And correctives to misinformation provide instant gratification during an otherwise unpredictable and potentially long-term crisis that so far has not provided scientists and policy-makers with a lot of success stories. Bodies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the World Health Organization can quickly implement myth-busting and rumor-control websites with the reasonable hope of staving off a more widespread problem down the road.

Cahill sits level with Damian Mori on 29 goals as Australia's leading goalscorer at international level and will have a chance to score his 30th on Wednesday as part of the Socceroos squad to face Ecuador in London.
 The match will be held at Millwall's home ground, The Den, where Cahill spent six years between 1998 and 2004, helping the London-based club to the FA Cup Final in his final season before leaving for Everton.
 The 34-year-old forward is expected to start against Ecuador on Wednesday and believes if he scores against the South Americans it will be an example of 'how the stars can align'.
 "To score tomorrow night, if I play, it's just one of those things in your career that would be really special because it's a place that I call home, along with Everton," Cahill said.
 "And it's definitely, to be all-time leading goalscorer for Australia, where it all started might be special, but if it's not here it will be somewhere else."
 Cahill, who now plies his trade with the New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer, said it had been an emotional week for him, returning to The Den with his national team.
 "I think for me it's a bit emotional because this is where it all started," the Sydney-born attacker said.
 "I learnt my trade here, played with some great players and it definitely has helped find who I am as a footballer today.
 "I still take the same traits as I did when I as 16, purely because of what I learnt from the players I played with, the fans, the club."

 "He will be the player that we will need to pay attention to (in the Champions League). We will have to watch him. He can make the difference at any time, he can be dangerous with each acceleration but, then, the whole world knows that."
 "We will not focus solely on him, although we will have to be vigilant."

Stephen Thomas, for Clarke, said it was accepted there were no excuses for the way the defendant had behaved but that the background to the incident were his mental health issues.
 He said his client had had a difficult upbringing following the separation of his parents, suffering bullying and abuse and later developing depression for which he turned to cannabis as a form of self-medication.
 The barrister said Clarke had been diagnosed with an unstable personality disorder, and understood that he need to address his mental health issues if he was to move on with his life, something he was motivated to do.
 He added that on the day in question he had "vented his anger" on the RSPCA officers following a neighbour-dispute and having his dog taken away, something he was sorry about.
 Judge Geraint Walters told Clarke he had behaved in a "quite outrageous manner" towards the RSPCA officers and the police.
 He said it was clear from the antecedent record that the defendant's offending was caused by his mental health difficulties, and he warned the defendant that if these were not tackled matters could "spiral out of control" and he would find himself spending "the best part of your life going in and out of prison".
 The judge said the offending was so serious it crossed the custody threshold but given the defendant had already been on remand in prison for three months and had therefore served the equivalent of a six month sentence, if he did send him straight to prison it would, in reality, only mean a few more months behind bars before being released.
 He said a better alternative would be to allow probation to work with Clarke to tackle his underlying mental health issues - he asked the defendant if he was willing to "fully engage" with the help on offer, and Clarke said he was.

New York state has done more than half a million tests to date, more per capita than anywhere in the globe, but it's still not enough. On Friday, Cuomo re-upped his still-unanswered call for more federal support (leading to a tete-a-tete with Trump that unfolded during his briefing), and ordered all public and private labs in New York to coordinate with the State Department of Health to ensure prioritizing diagnostic testing.

Parlamentul va fi implicat, de asemenea, în gestionarea stării de urgență și își recapătă astfel rolul de putere legiuitoare și de control a Guvernului.
 Prin urmare, restrângerea drepturilor fundamentale va fi făcută doar prin acte cu putere de lege și nu prin ordonanțe militare, modificate a doua zi, pentru că între timp guvernanții și-au dat seama că au greșit!
 Amendamentele PSD votate de plenul Parlamentului au impus, în concluzie, ca orice restrângere de drepturi sau libertăți ale cetățenilor să se facă prin lege, nu după bunul plac al unui guvern depășit cu totul de actuala criză națională.

De Blasio said a true return to "normalcy," or as close to normal as we'll get, is contingent upon citywide testing. Failing more help from the federal government, he has announced New York will start buying and manufacturing its own kits. He said the city would open five new testing sites in hard-hit areas, one in each borough. Some open Friday, the rest open Monday. Initially, the centers will be able to conduct up to 3,500 tests a week, though de Blasio said he wants see that number double "quickly." Other testing enhancements are in the works.

Although changing degrees of confidence are an everyday reality of scientific practice, COVID-19 studies are being prepublished and published—and then sometimes retracted or disproven—at such an accelerated pace that even experts struggle to separate signal from noise. Not only is there a lot the scientific community does not _yet_ know, but much of what it thinks it knows—what it now considers “accurate”—could turn out to be wrong.
