Apropos your editorial "Li­ce­n­ce to harass" (March 4), Vivad se Vishwas may be a scheme launched with the best of in­tentions, but the way to implement it is not to an­nounce ambitious Budget es­timates and arm twisting tax officials to bring in the revenues. In the short run, the terrorism of the taxmen may seem to bring in the moolah to a revenue-starved government, but in the long term, it would dent India's image on the "ease of doing business front. A healthy economy is one where the assessees, whether individuals or corporates, pay taxes according to simple laws. Having complex tax laws that provide ample scope for varied interpretations by the assessees and their consultants, followed by stiff de­mands by taxmen leading to prolonged litigation -- not to speak of the scope for corruption it provides -- are the precise reasons why investors are shying away from considering India as their preferred destination.

NEW BEDFORD -- Her contractions five minutes apart, Michelle Soto, her husband and father-in-law were on the way to the hospital when they spotted a car stuck on Route 18 in the rain.
 Despite Michelle's labor pains, she, husband Jouseph and his father Wilfredo stopped to lend a hand to the driver in distress.
 "That's what anybody should do," said Michelle, 22. "We see somebody in need, we go out of our way to help."
 But the driver, Ruth Blake, 63, of Plymouth, who'd run out of gas on her way to work at the state Department of Transitional Assistance in the South End, views it differently.
 "You just don't see angels all the time anymore and there they were," Blake said.
 The story unfolded earlier this month when Michelle's fourth child, a girl, due March 7, seemed to be arriving early.
 Wilfredo was driving Michelle and Jouseph, 24, to the hospital when they saw Blake whose bright blue FIAT 500 had come to a halt on busy JFK Memorial Highway in the rain. She seemed scared and unsure of what to do. There were cars behind Blake and people were honking their horns, Michelle said.
 "There's no place to pull over and everybody's whizzing by you," Blake said.
 She put on her hazard lights and fumbled with her cellphone as she thought about calling 911, when the Soto family pulled up near Rose Alley Ale House and New Bedford Tattoo Company.
 "They really didn't seem to think twice about reaching out to help a stranger," Blake said.
 Wilfredo got out and directed cars around Blake's and Jouseph pushed her vehicle onto a nearby street.
 Then the family welcomed Blake into their car, drove to Wilfredo's home in the South End to get a gas tank, and drove her to a gas station to get gas for Blake's car.
 Blake said after that, they followed her to a gas station where she could fill up her tank and to make sure she was all right. She said she tried to offer them money for their generosity, but they refused to take it.
 "They had the best excuse for not stopping but they did anyway," Blake said. "They really made it seem like it was no big deal and I shouldn't give it a second thought."
 As for Michelle's labor pains, when she got to the hospital that day, doctors tried to delay the birth until the 37-week mark, and she was able to go home. But she returned a few days later with more contractions.
 On Feb. 15, she gave birth to Jaxeydee (7 pounds, 3.5 ounces) who joins three older siblings.

The Asia Pacific region is anticipated to be the fastest-growing market during the forecast period, with a CAGR of 8.4%. The requirement for heavy metal testing has grown in the region in recent years, owing to an increase in the export of food products to the European region and consumer awareness in the Asia Pacific region regarding the safety of food products. China, India, and Japan drive the growth in this region. Manufacturers in many Asia Pacific countries have accepted and implemented good manufacturing practices (GMP), ISO 9000, and HACCP. This has driven the growth of the Heavy Metal Testing Market. China is a potential market for heavy metal testing due to the high level of contamination by heavy metals in soil and water. Food safety procedure compliance in Europe (a major importer) is pervasive, and due to continued food trade, Asian food producers have to comply with the food standards and regulations.

Once scripts are out of hands, it's much easier for the actors to focus on movement while on stage, as well as do things like hold a magazine, serve sherry, eat a piece of cake, or juggle a bag of apples, a jar of honey, and some handkerchiefs at the same time. It also makes it easier to spot where people can work on their deportment, bearing in mind the play's setting of a genteel English household in 1952. Directions such as "Hands out of pockets", "No slouching", and "Ladies, don't cross your legs" sometimes make rehearsals sound more like deportment lessons, although no one has been asked to walk across the stage while balancing a book on their head (yet).

The businessman and former three-term mayor of New York City is worth an estimated $55 billion, making him one of the richest men in the world. He made his fortune by creating a business that provides news, analytics and data to financial companies at a premium cost through terminals.
 The 78-year-old had flirted with presidential runs for more than a decade. He announced in March 2019 that he would not run. But then Bloomberg grew unhappy with the Democratic field and the weakness of the early front-runner Joe Biden, and announced in late November that he would seek the White House, kicking off his campaign with a $37-million weeklong ad blitz.
 As he joined a crowded field of Democrats who had been jostling for months over the direction of the party and who was best positioned to take on President Trump, Bloomberg was criticized by his rivals over his personal riches — especially in light of his opposition to a wealth tax. He was accused of not being a true Democrat, given his party registration shifts over the years.
 Bloomberg brushed aside such criticism, saying in November, “I am going to make my case and let the voters, who are plenty smart, make their choice.”

Sunday night Pete Buttigieg ended his campaign for president. Mayor Pete wasn't my first choice, but I nonetheless became emotional upon learning he would withdraw from the race. His campaign meant something to me, not only because of its historic significance, but also because of the personal connection I felt watching an out gay person run for political office.
   
 In 1982, the year Mayor Pete was born, a disease called gay-related immune deficiency was spreading in San Francisco and New York. The disease had other names -- gay plague and gay cancer -- but it eventually became known as AIDS.
   
 The federal government gave very little concern to the crisis in those early years. In a now infamous exchange, Press Secretary Larry Speakes was asked by Lester Kinsolving about President Reagan's response to the epidemic. Speakes responded by making jokes, and even went so far as to suggest Kinsolving get an HIV test, apparently unaware that one hadn't been invented yet.
   
 Stigma and homophobia prevailed. The Reagan administration did nothing to combat the AIDS epidemic. By the time President Reagan left office, 89,343 had died, disproportionately among the black and Latino communities. A generation of gay men was lost.
   
 To many, it's nothing short of a miracle that less than four decades after The White House turned a blind eye to the Queer community, one of its sons would win the Iowa Caucus. Mayor Pete's accomplishment was as improbable as it was historic. It shows just how far we've come, even if there's still a long way to go.
   
 Simply by running, Mayor Pete saved lives. Thirty-nine percent of LGBTQ youth contemplate suicide; 18% attempt it. I came out of the closet my freshman year of high school, and soon after was one of those 39% who wondered if life was worth living. It was 2004, and there weren't many Queer role models to look up to. Instead, I watched George Bush and John Kerry debate a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. They had different positions, both firmly believed marriage was between a man and a woman -- a stance even Barack Obama took four years later. None of them gave me much hope.
   
 I was fortunate to have family and friends who supported me through that difficult time. But there were many who didn't, and too many of them are gone. I wonder if a visible national figure might have given them hope and a reason to hang on. I can say with certainty that having someone like Mayor Pete to look up to would have made a world of difference to me.
   
 Mayor Pete, in his own words, turned an improbable hope into an undeniable reality. That reality is not yet one where a Queer person is president; but it is one where an out gay man can be taken seriously in his bid for America's highest office, campaigning with his husband at his side and giving hope to all the Queer youth who are watching. He kicked down the closet door, and I have faith it won't be long until someone steps through it and into the Oval Office.

The empty lot at 921 Main St. in downtown Bastrop was reduced to a bare space in January after contractors demolished the lot's only standing brick wall in preparation to construct a new building for the Art Institute of Austin.
   
 Now, contractors are working to determine a construction schedule by which the planned two-story, 9,000-square-foot building will be erected.
   
 Last week, the Bastrop Economic Development Corporation, which will own the building, approved a contract with an engineering firm for geotechinical services on the site.
   
 "It's like the person buying a house has to hire a building inspector -- it's a similar process for this," said BEDC Executive Director Cameron Cox.
   
 The board also approved last week the terms of a construction contract with Sabre Commercial for the full build out of the building. A guaranteed maximum cost of construction has not yet been defined in the contract, although the BEDC board has budgeted $1.8 million for the full project.
   
 The new two-story building, which will include an elevator, will be the future home of the Art Institute of Austin, which announced last year that it would be shuttering its Round Rock campus and relocating to Bastrop.
   
 Both stories of the new building will be leased by the institute for a 10-year period, and the building will be one of three locations the art school will occupy. It will also move into the Lost Pines Art Center where it will have classrooms, studios and an art gallery. Its third location will be at New Republic Studios in western Bastrop County, where the studio will build an 11,000-square-foot building that will house audio recording rooms, lab space, editing rooms, voice over rooms and ancillary space for the institute.
   
 The building along Main Street will house administrative offices and classrooms. It is expected to be completed before the institute begins summer classes in June. Once complete, the institute will offer degrees in design, media arts, culinary arts and fashion out of Bastrop, a location that may appeal to prospective students in south and east Austin.
   
 "There's going to be an opportunity for students in the Bastrop area and South and East Austin that perhaps didn't want to make the trip to Round Rock to give the Art Institute a look and consideration," said the Art Institute's chancellor Claude Brown last year during the school's announcement.
   
 The vacant lot at 921 Main St. has been a point of contention in Bastrop for years. The lot has stood vacant for about 15 years after several fires burned down buildings at the site, with the last one occurring in 2003. Until now, the future of the empty lot had remained up in the air. Some residents wanted the property to be transformed into a pocket park, others opted to transform it into a commercial space.
   
 In 2009, the city of Bastrop purchased the lot as part of a plan to expand downtown parking. The lot was used for special events until the city closed it in 2016 due to structural problems with the adjacent walls. Unwilling to spend money on repairs, the City Council sold the lot to the BEDC for $4 in 2016. The corporation's board then decided to build a two-story commercial building on the lot and find a tenant.

 The volatility in capital markets captures some of the growing concern over Covid-19, or coronavirus. Stock markets are very poor guides to the overall economy, but that does not mean they are wrong this time. In fact, I think they are late to the game.
 Much of the global economy has been slowing in recent months, and Covid-19 strikes directly at supply chains for the already-struggling U.S. manufacturing industry. At the very least, the next few months will see much of the globe enter recession. With those prospects, it is useful to think about the effects of viral pandemic on our economy.
 Large-scale disease has long been with us, but few Americans under 70 have meaningful memory of them.
 There is much we don't know about Covid-19. We don't know how many people are infected but show no symptoms, or whether some populations will enjoy some immunity. This also means we don't know what share of infections lead to disease or death. However, there are some aspects of this disease that may magnify its economic effect.
 First, this disease appears to be spread by aerosol, which is another way of saying that it is long-lived. Instead of dying out quickly after leaving a human host, it survives moving through the air and on surfaces. There's even evidence it can move through water or sewage systems and re-emerge as an airborne virus.
 This method of transmission means that the low-cost and easily implemented methods of breaking the chain of infection don't work well. With the common flu, schools manage to interrupt the spread of flu by closing over a long weekend. The presence of Covid-19 might mean schools, business and government offices may need to be closed for weeks. That is why Chinese officials have locked down whole provinces and are spraying disinfectant in the streets and homes.
 The second big concern is the high number of severe cases. Out of those who show symptoms, one in five are severe enough that they may require hospitalization. The U.S. has fewer than 800,000 hospital beds, which means we could accommodate an infected population of perhaps 4 million persons at one time, assuming no one else got sick and the disease was evenly spread around the nation.
 Of course, the disease won't hit randomly, but will be intense in one place, and then move on. In reality, even a modest outbreak would swamp local hospitals and physicians. There is no Public Health Service, National Guard or Reserve forces that could field and staff even an additional 100,000 hospital beds, a fraction of what we might need.
 The short-run economic effects will be caused by the shutdown of businesses and schools in an effort to slow transmission, and by the lost productivity of workers who are sickened or die of the disease, and the time lost to care for sick family and friends.
 All of this is sufficient to usher in a recession. There is no good news in a disease that will end far too many lives, but there may be less bad news for the U.S. than other places. Few Americans lived in the extremely high-density quarters common in China and Korea. Likewise, our sanitary infrastructure is more robust. These should help slow transmission.
 We are far more affluent and so have more resources to deploy against the disease. While many in public health organizations will criticize our governmental response, our ace in the hole will be our large private sector. While the Trump Administration dithers in its response, businesses are jumping to fill the demand for goods and services this disease will bring.
 The great lesson from natural disasters is not that prepared governments do well, but that a robust private sector is most responsive. For example, Wal- Mart had dozens of trucks with water and other supplies entering New Orleans before there was any meaningful federal response. We are just weeks, if not days, away from special sections in drug stores catering to Covid-19 risks. Our private markets will make slowing the spread and mitigating its effects far more effective here than in authoritarian China.

 NEW BEDFORD - The first baby born at the Buttonwood Park Zoo in 2020 is a Bolivian gray titi monkey, according to a press release.
 Born January 12, 2020, this monkey is the third birth for 11-year-old mom, Madeira, and 5-year-old father, Crumpet.
 This Bolivian gray titi monkey family has been growing since 2017, with the initial birth of son Biscuit, who is now 2 and ½ years old. In December 2018, daughter Mila was born, evening out the family dynamics. For the first several months, the new baby will mostly remain on the back of its parents or siblings - Zoo staff will be able to determine gender once it spends more time off its family.
 There are fewer than 55 Bolivian gray titi monkeys at 18 Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited institutions in North America. These tree dwelling monkeys weigh around two to three pounds as adults, have a lifespan of 20-25 years and are active during the day. Members of the group exhibit social bonding by sitting side by side and twining their tails. There is a strong bond between adult mating pairs; they stay close and carry out activities together, including infant care. The new baby will spend approximately 80% of the time on the back of dad, Crumpet.
 In the wild, this species is found in the tropical forests throughout central Bolivia and into Rondonia in eastern Brazil. Although their population in the wild is decreasing and agricultural activities have resulted in considerable habitat loss, Bolivian gray titi monkeys are reasonably tolerant of habitat disturbance and are adaptable to a variety of environments throughout its relatively wide range.
 Crumpet, Madeira, Biscuit, Mila and the new baby reside in the Zoo's innovative Rainforest, Rivers & Reefs exhibit. Opened in July 2017, Rainforests, Rivers & Reefs focuses on the conservation of endangered and threatened Neotropical forest species and the health of the world's oceans while connecting guests with small, endangered primates from regions of South America and ocean dwelling species from around the world. Interpretive signage and on-site education inspires visitors to take small, tangible actions to reduce their impact on habitats and oceans, furthering the Zoo's conservation mission to protect wildlife from extinction.

 Then earlier this week, Phil Harrison, the head of Xbox, posted a letter on Xbox.com giving a lot of new information on the upcoming Xbox Series X, and the machine sounds great.
 Xbox Series X is going to be a beast of a home console. The new system, expected to launch this holiday season, will be powered by Microsoft's custom- designed processor featuring AMD's Zen 2 and RDNA 2 architectures. I'm not a PC gamer, so I don't know what that means, but Harrison wrote in his letter that the new system will have four times the processing power of an Xbox One and that its 12 TFLOPS of GPU is twice that of an Xbox One X and more than eight times the original Xbox One.
 "Xbox Series X delivers a true generational leap in processing and graphics power with cutting edge techniques resulting in higher framerates, larger, more sophisticated game worlds, and an immersive experience unlike anything seen in console gaming," Harrison wrote in his letter.
 Its SSD hard drive will allow for game worlds that are larger, more dynamic and load much faster than the current systems allow.
 A new feature Harrison announced that sounds exciting to me is the new Quick Resume. The new system will let you suspend multiple games at one time, turn your system off and then return to them later almost instantly without having to wait through long loading screens.
 Harrison also talked about Xbox's commitment to games and gamers. All Xbox One games will be compatible with Xbox Series X, as will a large number of original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles, all them with faster load times, steadier frame rates and sharper graphics because of the increased power in the Series X.
 He also touted Microsoft's new Smart Delivery technology, in which a gamer will be able to buy certain games, all first-party Microsoft titles and some third-party titles, once and it will be optimized for whatever system you're playing it on.
 Not long after Xbox released all the new details on the Series X, game developer CD Projekt Red announced its upcoming "Cyberpunk 2077" will take advantage of Smart Delivery.
 Now is all of that enough for me to leave the PlayStation nation and jump ship to Xbox?
 I'm pretty well tied into the PlayStation platform. The Uncharted series is probably my favorite franchise in gaming, so it would be difficult for me to switch sides and pick up an Xbox Series X over a PlayStation 5.
 That being said, Microsoft is making some great decisions with the Xbox Series X, and everything they announced this week sounds terrific. A week ago I was 100% getting a PlayStation 5 this holiday season. While I am still very much leaning in that direction, Microsoft has swayed me some and given me something else to consider.

NEW BEDFORD - The first baby born at the Buttonwood Park Zoo in 2020 is a Bolivian gray titi monkey, according to a press release.
 Born January 12, 2020, this monkey is the third birth for 11-year-old mom, Madeira, and 5-year-old father, Crumpet.
 This Bolivian gray titi monkey family has been growing since 2017, with the initial birth of son Biscuit, who is now 2 and ½ years old. In December 2018, daughter Mila was born, evening out the family dynamics. For the first several months, the new baby will mostly remain on the back of its parents or siblings - Zoo staff will be able to determine gender once it spends more time off its family.
 There are fewer than 55 Bolivian gray titi monkeys at 18 Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited institutions in North America. These tree dwelling monkeys weigh around two to three pounds as adults, have a lifespan of 20-25 years and are active during the day. Members of the group exhibit social bonding by sitting side by side and twining their tails. There is a strong bond between adult mating pairs; they stay close and carry out activities together, including infant care. The new baby will spend approximately 80% of the time on the back of dad, Crumpet.
 In the wild, this species is found in the tropical forests throughout central Bolivia and into Rondonia in eastern Brazil. Although their population in the wild is decreasing and agricultural activities have resulted in considerable habitat loss, Bolivian gray titi monkeys are reasonably tolerant of habitat disturbance and are adaptable to a variety of environments throughout its relatively wide range.
 Crumpet, Madeira, Biscuit, Mila and the new baby reside in the Zoo's innovative Rainforest, Rivers & Reefs exhibit. Opened in July 2017, Rainforests, Rivers & Reefs focuses on the conservation of endangered and threatened Neotropical forest species and the health of the world's oceans while connecting guests with small, endangered primates from regions of South America and ocean dwelling species from around the world. Interpretive signage and on-site education inspires visitors to take small, tangible actions to reduce their impact on habitats and oceans, furthering the Zoo's conservation mission to protect wildlife from extinction.

It's the moment months of campaigning has been leading up to -- Super Tuesday.
 Super Tuesday -- on March 3 -- is likely the most important day on the primary calendar for Democratic hopefuls. It's when voters from 14 states will have their say, representing the largest single-day voting event during the primaries and a make-or-break moment for most of the candidates.
 To put it in perspective, the primaries are all about winning delegates -- think of it like the electoral college. There's a total of 3,979 delegates that will be awarded during the primary, and the candidate that makes it onto the ballot to run against the highly-likely Republican nominee President Donald Trump will need at least 1,991 delegates to support them. Each state is allotted a certain number of delegates.
 SIGN UP FOR THE INSIDE MASSACHUSETTS POLITICS NEWSLETTER.
 Despite all the hype for the early primaries -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina -- those states in total make up a tiny fraction of the delegates -- 155 or 4 percent. The Super Tuesday voting, in contrast, is 1,357 delegates, or about a third of the overall delegates.
 In a race that still seems largely undecided, the results of Super Tuesday are anticipated to bring the race into focus. It's a key moment for front-runner Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is facing significant competition from former Vice President Joe Biden, who is surging and expected to gain momentum as fellow moderates, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, have dropped out of the race.
 It will also determine the viability of the campaigns of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.
 So who's voting? California, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Tennessee, Alabama, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Utah, Maine and Vermont are all voting. There are both Democratic and Republican primaries in every state, but the focus is on the Democrats, as Trump is polling in the high 80s and low 90 compared to his little-talked-about challenger Bill Weld, who is in the single digits.
 It's a popular time for states to hold their primary, as many states feel going early in the process gives their state more weight. Notably, California moved its primary up this year to be part of Super Tuesday.
 The number of states voting also means it brings the most diverse set of voters to the voting booths, better reflecting the country's demographics. Pundits often talk about it as a chance to get a better look at how candidates will perform on a national level. Here's a breakdown on what to look for in every state.
 However, it's also important to note it's not the end of the primaries. Even if a candidate swept every state on Tuesday - which is extremely unlikely - it's still not enough to guarantee their spot on the ballot. The primaries will continue through June, and there's still time for candidates to sway voters.
 The Democratic National Convention, where the candidate will be finalized, is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from July 13-16. There, delegates will pick and send a candidate to the ballot in November.

"Good communication allows people to be able to enjoy various public services and enhance their lives. Sharjah has achieved this," he said.
 "Why is there a pressing need to transform the role of government communication from a one-way message delivery service to a two-way and participatory process?" asked Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Chairman of Sharjah Media Council, adding that the multifaceted challenges governments face around the world with regard to the health, environment, security and cultural sectors are because of the media spreading misinformation, or fabricated news affecting the trust between them and their people.
 "Through our years of research here in Sharjah, we have sufficiently established that communication is a key enabler of trust between governments and the governed, and a strategic driver of sustainable development. We need to incorporate mechanisms that will generate faster responses from the government to the public, between people from different cultures and between governments, globally," Sheikh Sultan added.
 He hailed the efforts and leadership of the Sharjah Ruler for having transformed the emirate over the past five decades into a regional hub for cultural advancement and for furthering its pioneering experience in cultural communication.

Apropos your editorial "Li­ce­n­ce to harass" (March 4), Vivad se Vishwas may be a scheme launched with the best of in­tentions, but the way to implement it is not to an­nounce ambitious Budget es­timates and arm twisting tax officials to bring in the revenues. In the short run, the terrorism of the taxmen may seem to bring in the moolah to a revenue-starved government, but in the long term, it would dent India's image on the "ease of doing business" front. A healthy economy is one where the assessees, whether individuals or corporates, pay taxes according to simple laws. Having complex tax laws that provide ample scope for varied interpretations by the assessees and their consultants, followed by stiff de­mands by taxmen leading to prolonged litigation -- not to speak of the scope for corruption it provides -- are the precise reasons why investors are shying away from considering India as their preferred destination.

BOSTON -- State representatives are seeking a significant overhaul of Democratic leadership's landmark transportation-related tax and spending package that the House will debate this week.
 In dozens of amendments, rank-and-file Democrats called for expanding the gasoline and diesel tax increases proposed by leaders, expanding road tolls to the state's borders and funding free public transportation. Republicans will seek to scrap tax hikes or at least sunset them once a potential income surtax takes effect.
 The House will begin the process by taking up a multi-pronged tax bill (H 4508) on Wednesday. The legislation, unveiled by House Speaker Robert DeLeo and his top deputies last week, seeks to raise $522 million to $612 million per year through a 5-cent gasoline tax increase, a 9-cent diesel tax increase, a tiered increase to the corporate minimum excise tax, higher fees on ride- hailing services, and application of the state sales tax to vehicle purchases by rental car companies.
 One amendment, filed by Brookline Democrat Rep. Tommy Vitolo and backed by the coalition Transportation for Massachusetts, would supplement the proposed fuel tax increases with additional future hikes.
 Under Vitolo's amendment, both the gas tax and diesel tax would each increase another 5 cents in 2022 and a third five-cente increase in 2024 until they reach 39 cents per gallon and 43 cents per gallon, respectively. The amendment also increases the Earned Income Tax Credit to offset the impact of gas tax increases on low-income workers.
 Other amendments would subject Suffolk and Middlesex Counties to a "higher tier" -- without specifying numbers -- of gas taxes, or would allow cities and towns to impose an additional 3-cent excise tax on fuel sales to retail dealers.
 Republican lawmakers are poised to challenge the tax hikes sought by the Democrats who wield a supermajority. Gov. Charlie Baker has threatened to veto a gas tax increase in the past, and last week outlined his opposition to that proposal and the corporate minimum increase.
 House Minority Leader Brad Jones filed amendments lessening the ride-hailing fee increases on shared and non-luxury trips and repealing the rental car sales tax application, while Rep. Elizabeth Poirier will seek elimination of the corporate minimum tax expansion.
 Jones criticized Democrats for pushing tax increases now while also continuing their pursuit of a 4-percent surtax on household income above $1 million. Supporters say the proposal, which needs approval from both branches in the next lawmaking session before it can go before voters as early as 2022, could raise up to $2 billion per year for education and transportation.
 Under an amendment Jones filed to the transportation revenue bill, the corporate, fuel, and rental car taxes -- together accounting for about $400 million in revenue -- would all be repealed if the so-called "millionaires tax" is implemented.
 "(The bill) has got to be considered in the context of: we're going to raise taxes, we have the largest rainy day fund we've ever had, we just had a $1 billion surplus last year, they're pushing a $2 billion tax increase -- what are they doing this for?" Jones told the News Service last week.
 Some lawmakers hope to see the bill take a clearer approach to how the roughly half-billion dollars in new revenue is spent. Democratic leaders proposed two $27 million dedicated streams, one going to the MBTA and the other split between the state's 15 regional transit authorities, but plan to use the bulk of the new funding during annual budget cycles or to backstop borrowing.
 At least three different representatives filed proposals to lower or eliminate public transit fares, an idea Senate President Karen Spilka has also targeted.
 A Rep. David LeBoeuf amendment would earmark one cent of the diesel tax to cover the cost of fare-free regional transit authorities, while a Rep. Joan Meschino amendment would use one cent from the gas tax to fund free MBTA buses and another cent for free RTAs.
 Rep. Tami Gouveia, an Acton Democrat and a member of the Legislature's progressive caucus, called for eliminating a sales tax discount for automobile trade-ins. Her office said the proposal could raise more than $120 million per year, which would be used to offer free, reduced and discounted fares on public transit across the state with focus on environmental justice and low- income communities.
 Transportation for Massachusetts Executive Director Chris Dempsey said the gas tax has increased at a significantly slower rate than MBTA and RTA fares over the past three decades, pushing more commuters into single-vehicle trips.
 "The message we've been sending people is to drive more and take transit less," Dempsey, whose group endorsed Gouveia's amendment, said. "Free fares on the RTAs, which are relatively cheap as a policy at roughly $30 million, sends the opposite message that we want people to take transit more."
 The House bill calls for a study of expanded roadway tolling and so-called "congestion pricing," where prices vary to incentivize off-peak travel, but some members want to go further.
 One amendment from Rep. Alice Peisch would establish tolls on all "Boston metropolitan area roadways and all interstate highways" with a plan for congestion pricing, and another from Rep. Carol Dykema would seek tolls on interstate highways at Massachusetts borders.
 Peisch, of Wellesley, and Dykema, of Holliston, both represent constituents who regularly pay tolls for using the Massachusetts Turnpike.
 Dempsey also said one of his top priorities is to see the House adopt a Rep. Michelle Ciccolo amendment eliminating language in the base bill that would scale back the gas tax increase if and when the multi-state Transportation and Climate Initiative goes into effect and raises gas prices.
 "TCI has the potential to be transformational," Dempsey said. "We don't want to see that potential diminished by a proposal that would net out that revenue and not leave us with more to invest in cleaner transportation."
 Leadership expects to tackle the revenue bill Wednesday and then take up a $14.5 billion transportation bond bill (H 4506) -- which trimmed $3.5 billion off the borrowing amount Gov. Charlie Baker sought in his version -- on Thursday.
 With 82 amendments filed on the revenue bill and 467 on the bond bill, the schedule is subject to change. Democratic leadership informed members to be prepared for a possible formal session on Friday if debate stretches to a third day.
 The vast majority of amendments on the bond bill seek earmarks for local transportation projects, although some seek further increases in Chapter 90 funding for road and bridge maintenance or expansion of the MBTA oversight board.

NEW BEDFORD -- As soon as Patricia and Roy Victor heard the news that Billy Boy Candies would be closing in April, the mother and son headed straight to the candy shop on Mount Pleasant Street.
 Patricia said she's been going to the store for decades, even before her son was born.
 "It's hard to believe, but there comes a time, you know how it is, a time to retire," Patricia said.
 Owners John and Jacqueline Bowden announced they would be retiring after running the store since 1974 in a post to the store's Facebook page on Monday.
 "We will stay open through Easter to serve our community for one last holiday," part of the post reads, "The Retail and wholesale store will close just after Easter in April."
 Roy said he enjoys coming to the store because the candy takes him back to when he was a kid.
 "I'll probably be here every weekend until they close the store stocking up," Roy said.
 Coming to the store all these years, Patricia said, "it's almost like a family, you come here all the time, you get to know the people."
 It's fitting that the customers feel like part of the family at Billy Boy Candies, since it's a family business.
 Jacqueline took over the store from her father Joseph Bettencourt who bought the business over 60 years ago.
 Originally Billy Boy Candies was just a wholesale facility, but Jacqueline opened the retail store in the late 70s, which she runs while her husband John runs the wholesale side of things.
 When asked what went into their decision to close, John said "Due to the fact our age is up there, and I should have retired 12 years ago, and our health is starting to get to us, we need some time to spend with each other."
 Both John and Jacqueline will be turning 75 this summer.
 The business has been up for sale since 2018, but the couple said that though they've had many offers, no one was able to secure the financing they needed to purchase it.
 "The whole thing that's tied it up is people could not get a loan because of it being liquid assets," John said, "that has a lot to do with it."
 Now, according to Jacqueline, the building is in litigation for sale, but the buyer doesn't plan to keep a candy shop at the 732 Mt. Pleasant Street location.
 The company itself is still for sale, but it would have to be relocated and would also depend on how much inventory is left in stock by the time they close in April, according to John.
 Jacqueline said she's enjoyed her years running the candy store, especially dealing with the customers, who were coming into the stores in droves expressing their disappointment at the news of the closure.
 "You guys is breaking my heart," Henry Gomes told Jacqueline Tuesday.
 Gomes said he has been coming to the store at least one a week for the past 30 years.
 Another customer told her "I'm going to miss you guys" after he made his purchase.
 Jacqueline could relate to their disappointment.
 "I'm a chocoholic," Jacqueline joked, "I'm going to have a problem myself shopping for chocolate, nevermind everyone else."
 In a more serious tone Jacqueline said, "I'd just like to thank everyone that's patronized us....we've met an awful lot of nice people throughout the years."
 "Forty-six years and I've loved every minute of it," John said, "I have wonderful customers in the wholesale world and I have to apologize to them all for leaving them out and stranded, but life goes on."
 Those customers even included one as far away as the tip of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.
 "Mostly people who call for shipments are people who were born and raised in New Bedford and have moved out since, and always remembered where they went to get their candy," John said.
 Billy Boy Candies is known for its extensive and unique candy offerings.

 "It's going to be a thing of the past, I don't see anyone buying the kitchen equipment and the recipes," John said of the drops, "We were the only ones who made the New England Old Fashioned Throat Drops."
 The process to make the drops is labor intensive, according to John, it takes two hours to make a 50-pound batch in molds which are over 100 years old.
 Though it could be challenging, Jacqueline said, she's always enjoyed running the candy shop.
 "Like I tell all my customers, if you're going to do something life, do something that you enjoy going into work every day and at the end of the day you know you've made a difference," John said.

Fancying a break from talking about the doom and gloom of the coronavirus, I took my lunch to the sea and sat and eat my lunch in the car watching the container ships being loaded. This little bird sat on my wing mirror and watched me eat my sandwich! The window was open too, I was dreading him flying in. He never stayed long, but amongst the constant news bulletins, and Corona discussions, he made me smile. A very worrying time.
