In late December, signs proclaiming it is “okay to be anti-Semitic” were found stapled to telephone poles in St. Albans. It was the second time in the last several months such signs were displayed, and the timing was purposeful; it was in the midst of the celebration of Hanukkah.
 That there are people who openly wear their biases against the Jewish people is not revelatory, even in Vermont, even in St. Albans. There are those among us who are not comfortable with anyone other than people who are stamped with the same history, the same values and the same culture, right down to the church they attend, the politics they practice, the socks they wear, and the high school teams for whom they cheer.
 But there is a difference between choosing one’s company, and allowing others to go in peace, and choosing one’s company and then defiling those who are different and who think and act differently. We have history books littered with examples of the blood-stained hatred of others and how the intolerance has made us small, deeply insecure, and backward-stepping. The message that thunders through each is that intolerance is difficult to stop if it’s not stopped early, and if it’s not opposed each and every time it raises its ugly head.
 That is where St. Albans finds itself in the moment. We know the person who stapled the signs to the poles does not represent the community’s values. We know the person involved represents a fractional sliver of the public’s numbers.
 But there is also the sense that if we say nothing the perpetrator’s acts will fade into the public’s distant memory and soon forgotten. Time heals all wounds, as the cliche goes. It’s a twisted spin of logic that allows us to pretend something is not as serious as it is, that there are easier ways to respond.
 The story has taken on a legal twist as well. Stapling signs to a telephone pole requires a city permit, although it’s a safe assumption that most of those signs [for a missing pet, etc.] are there sans permit. The words on the sign, “It’s okay to be anti-Semitic” are protected under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, which protects free speech. The perpetrator has no fear of being charged with a crime.
 But the legal argument is a vessel without serious meaning, and is misguided. This is not about putting someone in jail for being hateful. It’s about a community speaking out in ways that make it clear the land on which the perpetrator stands is an island of one. What’s important is to disabuse the person of the thought that stapling anti-Semitic signs in public places is a successful way to spread his or her beliefs.
 It isn’t. It can’t be. Not here. Not anywhere.
 The struggle is as daunting as it’s ever been, thanks to the anonymity afforded by the Internet, engineered by the disaffected few to push us behind the lines of our tribal inclinations. And it’s as important as it’s ever been to oppose this tribalism, to oppose separating people because they are different and to do it by sowing hatred. This opposition has to be forceful. And public. And forever.
 That is as true in St. Albans as it is in New York City, or Chicago, or anywhere else where diversity, in all its richness, is on display.
 As to St. Albans, we cannot build ourselves a new city and then allow ourselves to be characterized as a place that countenances intolerance, or racial hatred, or cultural differences whether they be religious, or otherwise.
 We’re better than that. That’s what the anonymous one who staples messages of intolerance on telephone poles needs to hear.

But Sajjan's press secretary, Todd Lane, would not say whether contingency plans are in the works for getting Canadian military personnel out of Iraq should the situation there deteriorate further.
 Canada has 250 military members working with the NATO training mission as well as dozens of special forces troops who've been working in the northern part of the country with Iraqi security forces.
 Iraqi lawmakers approved a resolution Sunday asking the Iraqi government to end an agreement under which American and allied forces have been in the country for more than four years to help fight the Islamic State group, also known as Daesh.
 The bill is nonbinding and subject to approval by the Iraqi government but has the backing of the outgoing prime minister.
 The Canadian-led NATO training mission in Iraq has been temporarily suspended in the wake of the killing of top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.
 A U.S. airstrike Friday killed Soleimani and a number of top Iraqi officials at the Baghdad airport.

 A public-health doctor is warning that people who've never smoked marijuana could be at the highest risk of overdosing on cannabis edibles, which are soon expected to be on store shelves across the country.
 Doctor Lawrence Loh, in the School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, says anyone who's expecting a quick high could overdose on products such as cookies and brownies because food takes time for the body to absorb compared with smoking.
 He says that means people could eat more than the marked dose of a product and end up with a racing heart, panic attacks and anxiety that sends them to the emergency room.
 Loh has co-authored a commentary published today in the Canadian Medical Association Journal about the health risks of edibles, which Health Canada recommends should be consumed in a 10-milligram dose of T-H-C, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.
 Regulations governing edibles, beverages, vapes and topical forms of cannabis came into effect last October, a year after Canada legalized fresh or dried bud, oil, plants and seeds.
 Most provinces have started selling cannabis edibles, with retail sales in Ontario starting today before products are available online next week.

 Canada earned its first medal in Europe since winning gold in 2008 when the Czech Republic last hosted. The Canadians finished a disappointing sixth on home soil last year when they were upset by Finland in the quarters.

 President Donald Trump insists that Iranian cultural sites are fair game for the U.S. military, dismissing concerns within his own administration that doing so could constitute a war crime under international law. He also warned Iraq that he would levy punishing sanctions if it expelled American troops in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad that killed a top Iranian official.
 Trump’s comments Sunday came amid escalating tensions in the Middle East following the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds force. Iran has vowed to retaliate and Iraq’s parliament responded by voting Sunday to oust U.S. troops based in the country.

 STRYDENBURG/GROBLERSHOOP, South Africa (Reuters) - A severe drought is threatening South Africa's wildlife industry, with game farmers keeping fewer animals and tourists visiting game lodges in smaller numbers.
 Parts of the country have been affected by consecutive years of abnormally hot weather and below average rainfall that have scorched grazing lands and dried up watering holes since 2015, the driest year on record.
 Industry body Wildlife Ranching South Africa (WRSA) estimates the Northern Cape province has lost more than two-thirds of its game over the last three years. It is conducting a countrywide survey to determine the scale of animal losses and the financial impact on the country's more than 9,000 wildlife ranches.
 "It's been an extraordinary drought," said WRSA chief Adri Kitshoff-Botha. "It's not a one-year or two-year drought. In some areas we've seen it has been going now for six years."
 The wildlife industry generates revenue for South Africa through tourism, hunting, breeding and meat production. Trophy hunting alone generated 2 billion rand ($140 million) in 2016, according to research carried out for the environment ministry.
 Southern Africa's temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, and in much of South Africa the level of water in reservoirs is dwindling.
 For Burger Schoeman, manager at Northern Cape game farm Thuru Lodge, the withered vegetation and parched ground are a serious concern for the sector.
 Once home to around 4,500 wild animals - including 35 different species, from antelope to rhino - the lodge has lost around 1,000 animals due to drought. Carcasses are piling up in abandoned mines on the edge of the property.
 "At this stage we are quite stretched. All the money you get from selling the animals, meat and all of that, gets put straight back into the property to look after the rest of the animals," Schoeman said.
 The lodge has seen costs rise as it buys in additional feed for the animals, but hunters are paying less and fewer tourists are coming as the animals are in worse condition.
 At the 48,000-hectare Karreekloof Safari Lodge in the same province, rangers come across carcasses every week.
 "Nobody wants to buy the game, because they also (are experiencing) ... the same drought," said farm manager Gideon Watts, adding that his farm received a quarter of its usual rainfall this season.
 The industry has seen a decline of around 20% in tourist numbers over the past year, said WRSA's Kitshoff-Botha.
 The drought has also hit the rest of the region, with Botswana, home to almost a third of Africa's elephants, seeing more than 100 of the creatures die in two months last year.

RIYADH (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th January, 2020) Saudi Arabia was not consulted by its ally Washington over a US drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, an official said Sunday, as the kingdom sought to defuse soaring regional tensions.Saudi Arabia faces a "heightened risk" of missile and drone attacks, the United States warned, after Tehran vowed "revenge" following the strike on Friday that killed powerful commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad."The kingdom of Saudi Arabia was not consulted regarding the US strike," a Saudi official told, requesting anonymity."In light of the rapid developments, the kingdom stresses the importance of exercising restraint to guard against all acts that may lead to escalation, with severe consequences," the official added.Saudi Arabia s foreign ministry made a similar call for restraint at the weekend and King Salman emphasised the need for measures to defuse tensions in a phone call on Saturday with Iraqi President Barham Saleh.In a separate phone call with Iraq s caretaker premier Adel Abdel Mahdi, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stressed "the need to make efforts to calm the situation and de-escalate tensions", the official Saudi Press Agency reported.The crown prince has instructed Prince Khalid bin Salman, his younger brother and deputy defence minister, to travel to Washington and London in the next few days to urge restraint, the pan-Arab Asharq al-Awsat newspaper reported.Prince Khalid will meet White House and US defence officials, the paper said, citing unnamed sources.The killing of Soleimani, seen as the second most powerful man in Iran, is the most dramatic escalation yet in spiralling tensions between Washington and Tehran and has prompted fears of a major conflagration in the Middle East.US President Donald Trump, who ordered the drone strike, has warned that Washington will hit Iran "very fast and very hard" if the Islamic republic attacks American personnel or assets.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both allies of Washington, are also vulnerable to Iranian counter strikes.The American embassy in Riyadh on Sunday warned its citizens there was a "heightened risk of missile and drone attacks" close to military bases and energy facilities, particularly in the kingdom s oil-rich Eastern Province and areas near the Yemen border.
