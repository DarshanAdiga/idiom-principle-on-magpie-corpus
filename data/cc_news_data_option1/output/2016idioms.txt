The states Governments have compounded the situation with tentative approach to the lockdown order. They are not all on the same page and the desire to score some cheap political points has seen some State Chief executive playing to the gallery with some of them openly disavowing the seriousness of the pandemic. There are self-inflicted errors and injures too by the managers of the process. Ordinarily the controversy over the "Chinese Doctors" was needless. However the fact that the fact was not put in the public domain as at when due led to wild speculations and did a lot of damage to the PTF and the NCDC. The Gombe protest by “COVID-19 patients” , the hostage taking in Kano where some doctors were “arrested” for hours by “COVID -19 patients” over shoddy treatment by the authorities ,and the different figures being bandied about as the cost of a test to determine infection have further fueled controversy surrounding the nature and management of COVID-19 in Nigeria. And the comical is also part of the loop. How come patients said to be undergoing treatment for COVID-19 after testing Positive were engaged in energetic and pulsating activities and dancing as seen in some covert videos recorded in some of the isolation centers?

Rather than hate laden abuse and puerile attacks on the chief, Ihekweazu well researched and fact based apologia put the matter to rest and provided priceless enlightenment to all and sundry. The NCDC and its affiliates should now focus on improvement of monitoring and TESTING and quarantine mechanisms and structures while the Federal and State Governments and the PTF focus on treatment of COVID-19 patients, with inputs from NCDC, and Enhancement of Health Care facilities. The gains and verve achieved at the onset should be rekindled and improved upon. This is not the time to lose the battle .The current drift must be halted. There should be synergy amongst all those involved in this onerous task and they should be on the same page in the fight against Corona Virus. That's how to make things right and win the battle against COVID-19 Nigeria.

Denton Community Market vendors were excited to network with customers again Saturday now that the market has reopened for its 11th season amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The market’s board of directors announced in early May that the market would reopen May 23 with a smaller number of vendors and guidelines to follow in light of the pandemic.
 Visitors walked around, bought bottles of ginger beer and lined up for fresh produce while vendors completed transactions donning masks and gloves. Signs around the market advised visitors to wear masks and keep a safe distance away from one another, although not everyone followed these suggestions.
 “I’m just excited to see everyone,” said Kate Alfred of Pie by Kate. “We have a lot of regulars. It’s really nice to see more familiar faces and get to a new normal.”
 Both Alfred and Richard Greer from Narrow Way Farms said they fulfilled orders during stay-at-home orders with drop-offs and deliveries.
 “We adjusted [during stay-at-home orders] but I’m glad to be back,” Greer said. “The hard part was not networking with customers as much.”
 Customers chatted with vendors like old times while staying further away. One customer dropped by Alfred’s tent to pick up a pie and called out that she was sending her “virtual hugs.”
 Vicki Oppenheim, the board of directors president for the market, said Thursday that Denton County officials granted the market’s board permission to reopen after they unveiled their plan.
 Opening day would be a food and farm only market with about 20 vendors, congregating would be discouraged, kids’ activities and live music are out for the time being, and they would recommend visitors follow CDC guidelines.
 “We are glad to see the opening of the Denton Community Market as we know they provide an important service to our residents,” Denton County Judge Andy Eads said Friday. “With the implementation of safety protocols, we believe residents will be able to visit the Denton Community Market on Saturdays to fulfill their needs while maintaining the health and safety of both vendors and customers.”
 David Weaver of SoCo Ginger Beer said he missed the community market, which was originally scheduled to open in April.
 “I think the market will pick back up if we do it logistically,” Weaver said. “It’s a special interaction, face-to-face, with your customers.”
 Brenda Wilson, a Denton resident, visited the market Saturday wearing an “I Love You Denton” mask. She goes to the market frequently to support local vendors and was happy when opening day finally came.
 “I’m a people person,” Wilson said. “I don’t have to interact with people, just being here with people [is enough] and not stuck at home going stir crazy.”
 The Denton Community Market is open from 9 a.m. to noon every Saturday at 317 W. Mulberry St., with summer hours being 8 a.m. to noon.

In swimming, our JV and varsity practice together and they all do the same workout, to an extent. I like that we don't have that separation because it allows them to form those bonds and motivate each other during practice."

The most pressing issue facing our district is delivering an equitable education to all students while meeting the various needs of our students such as our English language learners and our students with disabilities. Prior to the pandemic students were in classrooms receiving in person instruction by their teachers. English language learners as well as students with disabilities were receiving additional supports and services such as speech, PT, OT and counseling. Many of our economically disadvantaged students were receiving free breakfast and lunch. This was all abruptly upended and changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The District found itself setting up remote education on the fly as many other districts did. The District also found many students did not have access to technology and/or WiFi at home. The Board of Education needs to ensure there are committees and teams to handle each issue as effectively as possible. The district’s “Technology Plan” needs to be revised and updated to ensure that teachers have the training to utilize technology effectively to reach and teach all students in real time and on a regular schedule. The board needs to ensure that parents are being kept in the loop on the schedule of lessons and when assignments are due so that they are able to manage their work schedules around the online learning as well. The Board needs to ensure that our teachers also have the support of administration during this time of crisis.
