He came up the order against Delhi, so obviously all other players shifted down. From the context of the game, we probably went behind the eight ball, Delhi bowled well, Delhi is the team who has looked the most promising in the tournament,&quot; Morgan said in the post-match press conference.

The Dodgers acquired Mookie Betts in February and committed $365 million to him in July for one reason above all: To put them over the top in October. They wanted him for the kind of game-changing playoff moment he delivered in the fifth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday.
 Betts had never faced Brandon Woodruff, a hard-throwing right-hander, before Game 2 of the National League wild-card series. The first two encounters were one-sided.
 Betts struck out trying to check his swing on a 97-mph fastball up and out of the strike zone in the first inning. He didn’t even bother waiting to see the first base umpire’s ruling on the appeal. He knew he committed.
 In his second at-bat, Woodruff fooled Betts with an 85-mph changeup that dove back over the outer half of the plate for strike three looking to end the third inning. Betts walked to the dugout without protest. He was again soundly defeated. The strikeouts were two of the eight Woodruff accumulated in the first four innings.

Trump coronavirus: President 'not yet out of the woods' but medical team 'cautiously optimistic'

It’s a very serious issue and I will be honest. It can be frustrating sometimes because some agencies of government don’t really understand the need for collaboration. They don’t understand why we are pushing for this cooperation. I will give you an example, God forbid an airplane drops into the sea, AIB doesn’t have the capacity for sea divers to retrieve any wreckage or black boxes, but Nigerian Navy does. Since 2017, I have been pushing the Nigerian Navy to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with AIB. It is not the day that we have an accident that we will start looking for who to call. This is the essence of these MoUs. Recently, we signed an MoU with the Nigerian Air Force and one of the benefits of that is that aircraft could drop off anywhere; bad terrain, difficult terrain that we cannot access. Air Force can help us with the logistics. We too can be of help to the Nigeria Air Force because we have a world-class safety lab in Abuja, rather than Air Force sending down their black boxes to overseas for download, they can use our lab in Abuja to do the download and save our country some costs. At the end of the day, it is to the benefit of the entire nation.

Una de sus insistencias es deshacer su fama de intelectual, que a su entender se debe a su aspecto físico y sus lentes, y, en todo caso, a una eventual coartada de seducción antes que a un interés real. A Allen, criado en una familia judía de Brooklyn, le interesaban los deportes, la radio, los letristas del Tin Pan Alley, los gánsters. Que alguien sin embargo pueda nombrar al pasar como lecturas indiscriminadas a Kafka, Hemingway o Thomas Mann (y se defienda diciendo que no leyó _Ulises_ , ni el _Quijote_ , ni _Lolita_ ) no dice tanto de su solapada voracidad como de un hecho: que en otros tiempos tener un poco de cultura general no era tan estrambótico. Del idéntico modo puede entenderse su exploración de la música clásica a la par del jazz. Sus gustos en cine van por el mismo lado, aunque diga preferir a Chaplin antes que a Buster Keaton. Su admiración por Ingmar Bergman alcanzó a rozar la copia (en _La otra mujer_ ), pero no llegó a tanto como para aceptar la invitación del director sueco a que lo visitara en las alejadísimas islas Feroe, donde vivía.

You will agree with me that it will start once the bill is approved by the National Assembly and the Presidency. Currently, we are set out to investigate air accident and there is a proposed bill in the National Assembly. At the House of Representatives, it has passed the second reading; we are waiting for public hearing on the new AIB bill. At the Senate, we are waiting for second reading and public hearing. Thereafter, it will be transmitted to the President for assent. For us, when you look at what we’ve done in air transport, we have been able to mitigate so many risks; we have managed to learn from our lessons in serious incidents. You look at aviation, it is a highly regulated industry, very expensive, highly technical, the fastest and the safest means of transportation and it is because of all these checks and balances that have made it so. There is a difference between investigating for liability, criminality and safety. AIB has been investigating for safety, not for liability and it is the same we want to take to other modes of transportation. It is not about who is at fault, it is about how can we prevent future occurrence. This is our core mandate and this is what we want to focus on.

Theresa Greenfield, candidate for U.S. Senate, smiles standing next to the boxes of signatures just submitted to get on the ballot for the 2020 Senate race, on Wednesday, March 4, 2020, at the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines. Iowa U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst says she has been "very consistent" in her views on Supreme Court nominees despite supporting a vote on President Donald Trump's nominee while working with other Republicans to block a nomination by President Barack Obama. Ernst was asked about her seemingly contradictory stands during a televised debate with Democrat Theresa Greenfield that touched on topics ranging from the Supreme Court and Trump's tax returns to health care and racial justice.

At odds of 11-1, Swiss Skydiver pulled off an upset of 3-2 favorite Authentic, who came in off winning the Kentucky Derby. It became a two-horse race with the rest of the field 10 lengths behind.
 Jesus' Team was a distant third at 40-1 and Art Collector fourth at 2-1. The 145th running of the Preakness at a mostly empty Pimlico Race Course came four weeks after the Kentucky Derby and 3 1/2 months since the Belmont as they were held out of order for the first time since the 1930s.

Instead, why not pick targets for things that a business is pretty sure are reachable and then  _exceed them_  (that’s the stuff of an undergraduate class in communications, BTW). Skip all of the fluffy language — Coca-Cola says its Business and Sustainability Report is about “working together to create a better shared future for our people, our communities and our planet” — and focus instead on the specifics of a business and how sustainable practices are good for it first, not the planet or good feelings. Businesses are profit making entities and not NGOs, and if the truth that staying in business is a fundamental goal, someone will catch the disconnect sooner vs. later (as is the case for Coca-Cola).

Last week, an Oregon County Judge erroneously ruled the State of Missouri must sell 625 acres next to the pristine Eleven Point River downstream from Greer Spring. The judge’s ruling threatens our beloved state park system and sets a dangerous precedent that cannot stand. Missouri needs to appeal — and appeal now.
 The judge’s ruling centers on the fact that the acres in question are covered by a federal conservation easement. In essence, the judge reasoned that without unfettered public use of the land, it could not be a park. This defies both common conservation practices and common sense.
 The federal easement on this land is certainly not unique. Other state parks, including Echo Bluff and Current River State Parks, are protected by similar easements. Other types of reasonable restrictions on use are frequently established and enforced by park professionals for safety and to ensure that parks serve everyone in perpetuity. For instance, at Johnson’s Shut-ins State Park, visitors are not allowed to jump from certain bluffs, and access to these areas for rock climbing is by permit only.
 The judge also misinterpreted the intent of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System Act of 1968. Its purpose is to preserve the free-flowing character of rivers like the Eleven Point, many of which are “generally inaccessible except by trail.” This language is an indication by Congress that these areas were to be managed by state and federal agencies and enjoyed by the public — but has nothing to do with whether the lands are part of a state park.
 Today, the federal Mark Twain National Forest operates canoeing accesses and campgrounds on the Eleven Point both up and downstream from the land in question. During good weather, outdoor enthusiasts legally ply and trod the waters and banks of the Eleven Point daily. It is simply incorrect to rule that the law prohibits the Eleven Point from running through a state park.
 Rather than a solitary judge in the wilderness making speculative decisions about what might or might not happen in the future, professional park and forest rangers should work together and make decisions based on real issues in the long-term best interests of our state and nation. For the foreseeable future, this 625-acre tract would serve as a conservation corridor along the river and help encourage vital discussions about how best to protect Missouri masterpieces like the Eleven Point.
 The acquisition of this land is another testament to Missouri’s long and proud heritage of conservation. A significant portion of the purchase price back in 2016 came from a lead company bankruptcy that we chased all the way to Texas. As part of that matter, we worked with the federal government to clean up lead contamination and acquire new park lands to compensate for the land the company had ruined.
 Acquiring this land for a state park was not a unilateral decision. The federal court prescribed the use of the trust funds set aside by the lead company’s bankruptcy, and federal partners approved the expenditure of the trust funds in accordance with the court’s mandates. The Oregon County judge gave no consideration to these complex legal realities.
 The Eleven Point is one of our nation’s greatest wild rivers, and it is a priceless gem of our rich natural heritage as Missourians. Coveted by paddlers for the backcountry experience and anglers for the Blue-Ribbon rainbow trout fishery, the Eleven Point belongs to all of us.
 As Missourians, we need to fight for the legacy of our state park system and take this case to the Court of Appeals immediately. Recently, the Missouri Supreme Court unanimously overturned a local decision that deer on hunting preserves are “livestock” instead of “wildlife” to be managed professionally by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Correcting bad decisions is the role of the courts, not managing deer or parks.
 On the day Missourians voted to elect President Trump with 57% of the ballot, 81% of the voters overwhelmingly reapproved the Parks, Soil and Water Conservation Sales Tax to ensure strong and reliable funding for our unparalleled state park system. Missourians must rally once again to protect our parks from short-sighted judicial activism. Rangers, not judges, should run our parks.
 Jay Nixon is the former state Governor. Bill Bryan is the former parks director.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - The experimental antibody drug given to President Trump was said to be one of the most promising in preventing serious illness from a COVID-19 infection.The President has received a dose of the experimental antibody cocktail REGN-COV2 created by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.Infectious disease expert, Dr. Michael Saag, with the University of Alabama at Birmingham explained the cocktail reduces the amount of virus in the body and symptoms go away almost twice as fast.“The Regeneron drug is basically two antibodies- that means they are two proteins made by the immune system- and what they do it attack the outer portion of the virus called the spike protein where it bonds and enters into cells. It blocks those in two different locations,” Dr. Saag explained.Saag said the new drug shows better results than convalescent plasma.“Because the plasma has all kinds of antibodies in it, which is what this drug is, except they’re all over the place, number one; and number two, there are varying levels from patient to patient in terms of the donor. So, in this case, the antibody is manufactured in a lab, so there’s a known amount of antibody for every dose and that way it’s a lot more standardized,” He said.The president’s doctor got special permission under “compassionate use” provisions from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use the drug because it hasn’t been approved for public use and is still in clinical trials.“I don’t blame him for getting it. If I were in that situation I would want it too,” said Saag.At the time this article was written, Dr. Saag said the only way for the public to get the treatment is to sign up for a clinical trial through UAB; even then the participant had a 1 out of 3 chance of getting a placebo.Since the drug is still being tested, safety and effectiveness are not yet known. Thus far, no treatment has proved to prevent serious illness after infection.The President was also being treated with Remdesivir.Copyright 2020 WBRC. All rights reserved.

Seventeen-year-old girls have a lot on their minds.
 There’s school, proms, parents, parties, gossip and the inordinate amount of general anxiety that comes with being a teenager in the 21st Century. Still, preparing for a massive earthquake likely isn’t on the list of priorities, even for a teen living in Southern California. The idea of what to do if the “big one” strikes, much like climate change or, up until recently, surviving a global pandemic, is often too conceptual of a threat to really grasp at such a young age.
 For Ruby, the central character in Marisa Reichardt’s “Aftershocks,” the “big one” could not have come at a more inopportune time. She’s just had a fight with her best friend, her relationship is on the rocks and the novel opens with her skipping water polo practice because she just found out her mom is dating her coach. Suddenly, she’s trapped in a laundromat with a guy who, just moments before, she was attempting to convince to buy her beer.
 “We spend so much of our lives worrying about these little things, but of course, when you’re a teenager like Ruby, these are big things,” says Reichardt from her home in Los Angeles. “But they’re not big compared to a 7.8 magnitude earthquake. So I wanted to look at what it looks like when these smaller things that you’re allowing to take up all your headspace, and what that it looks like when something much bigger can happen in an instant.”

LAWRENCE -- Les Miles hasn't been in this position often throughout his Hall of Fame-caliber career, the Kansas football head coach tasked Saturday with delivering a postgame address to a locker room of players on the wrong end of a blowout.
   
 With the way this season is unfolding, though, it may soon become old hat for the "Mad Hatter."
   
 The Jayhawks were routed for a third time in three games, this time dropping a 47-7 decision to No. 17 Oklahoma State at David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium. An anemic offense and a defense susceptible to giving up big plays proved a lethal combination for KU, which was outgained in total yardage 593-193.
   
 The Jayhawks (0-3, 0-2 Big 12) have now been outscored 132-44 this season, dropping each outcome by at least 15 points. To put that into perspective, consider this: Across the 197 games he coached before accepting the KU job a year ago, Miles had just 19 such defeats, and only eight by that margin since the start of the 2006 season.
   
 So, then, what is a national championship-winning coach to say?
   
 "We're in pain, but in my opinion, we're going to continue to work hard," recalled Miles, revisiting his postgame comments to players. "You're going to be something. This is going to be a good football team."
   
 In these moments, Miles said he seeks to strike an "honest and optimistic" tone.
   
 "It's fundamental for me to tell you that I am going to award and enjoy people," Miles said, "as opposed to kick 'em in the tail and treat 'em roughly."
   
 The only tail-kicking done Saturday was by OSU (3-0, 2-0), particularly in the first half.
   
 The Cowboys sextupled the home squad in total yardage, 362-60, across the game's first two quarters en route to a 31-0 advantage at intermission. KU, which punted seven times in the opening half, didn't cross midfield until late in the second quarter, and two plays after it did, quarterback Miles Kendrick chucked an interception into double coverage for the Jayhawks' first turnover.
   
 OSU, which deploys star running back Chuba Hubbard, did its biggest damage through the air in the first half. Quarterback Shane Illingworth, starting in place of the injured Spencer Sanders, hit wideouts Braydon Johnson and Tylan Wallace on back-to-back second quarter possessions to make it a 24-0 game -- Johnson's reception went for 66 yards on the first play of the Cowboys' fourth drive, while Wallace took advantage of busted coverage for a 55-yard strike.
   
 No KU defender was within 15 yards of Wallace when Illingworth threw the ball.
   
 "I can't wait to meet (Sunday or Monday) with some of these coaches and find out where that went (wrong)," Miles said of Wallace's wide-open score. "Yeah, I didn't see any coverage."
   
 Wallace hauled in a 14-yard touchdown on OSU's first possession of the second half, and on KU's subsequent drive, Pooka Williams was stuffed on a fourth- and-1 play that turned the ball over on downs at the Jayhawk 35 -- the preseason All-Big 12 pick finished with 14 carries for just 32 yards. The Cowboys capitalized with a 22-yard field goal and a 41-0 lead.
   
 Velton Gardner's 1-yard touchdown plow early in the fourth quarter represented the last gasp for an otherwise pulseless Jayhawk team.
   
 "I didn't feel like they were overwhelmed," Miles said. "I felt like, should we continue to go on the course that we're going, I think we're going to be fine. I like us. I like our team. I think we'll work together and do things that this school has done before."
   
 Kendrick, who took over for injured starter Jalon Daniels (3-for-5 passing for 2 yards), finished 11-for-19 for 90 yards and the interception. Illingworth was 17-for-23 for 265 yards and three touchdowns, and Hubbard had 20 carries for 145 yards and two scores.
   
 After a week off, KU will return to action against West Virginia on Oct. 17 in Morgantown, W.Va. The Jayhawks' next home game won't come until a Halloween date versus Iowa State.
   
 "They're resilient, they want to win, they're competitive," Miles said of his team. "I'm going to believe in them, and that's my choice, and I think it's the right thing to do because I think they will overcome."

"Families are exempt," Arn continued. "They're out of the discussion where the business is concerned -- they're innocent, they're civilians. You don't get involved in a guy's personal life. So, it was just one of those things that I didn't know how much these guys are knocking. I know this: up close, they're not going to piss at each other. That I know and I can attest to, and just as the fallout, if you try to get in there, they'd knock the piss out of you, too. I learned that pretty quickly -- to keep my head low on that stuff, but that whole period was a jumbled up mess and it had everybody confused."
 Arn would obviously later go on to join WWE and spend many years in a backstage role with the company. He took the time to give his thoughts on Triple H as an executive producer, and he revealed that the two of them think a lot alike. He even called Triple H a "throwback" to '80s style professional wrestling while saying he has a good grasp on the business.
 "He's following the lead of his father in law," Arn said. "He is putting forward the policies that Vince has laid out. I think he speaks well. I think he has a good grasp of the business, but I've always dealt with him. That's the one blessing that I've had... I came from the era I came from and I think he's a bit of a throwback as far as his work back to an '80s style worker."
 "He's a guy that could have fit in the '80s," Arn added. "As far as the way he works, he's not a big high spot guy and all that stuff, so I dealt with him more on the mechanics of matches and things like that. And sometimes, he would ask my opinion on stuff. I think he's always been in his mind, and maybe it was the plan of the company for him to one day take over the leadership of the company. You've got Shane and Steph, who would probably fall in line... Since they are Vince's kids, but who knows? Steph has her job as far as the branding, and Shane does his thing. I don't know how it's lined up, and you'll never know until the day arises who exactly will run the company."
