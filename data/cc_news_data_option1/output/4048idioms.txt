Indeed, players often have used these off weeks to visit their hometowns, take their families on a quick trip or return to their alma maters to watch college football games from the sidelines. They won’t get those chances this year.
 “We have new protocols in place that are meant to keep everybody safe and healthy,” Lions coach Matt Patricia said. “And that’s important right now. We’re still in that world and still in the middle of COVID-19.”
 Both teams understand what’s at stake, particularly in light of recent events.
 The Tennessee Titans have had 20 positive cases since Sept. 29, which caused their scheduled Oct. 4 game with the Pittsburgh Steelers to get pushed back to Oct. 25. New England canceled its practices Wednesday and Thursday amid reports that a third Patriots player has tested positive.
 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell warned all 32 teams Monday that any violations of COVID-19 protocols that force schedule changes could result in punishment including forfeiting games, fines or loss of draft picks.
 The NFL sent out a reminder Friday that the league’s agreement with the NFL Players Association in August means players who miss tests can be punished with a $50,000 fine. A second missed test can result in a one-game suspension.
 “There definitely had to be a lot of sacrifices made this year for this season to happen, but I think everyone can say that they’re definitely willing to make those sacrifices,” Lions center Frank Ragnow said.
 The Packers’ off week comes at a time when the high COVID-19 rates around Green Bay caused the team to announce Tuesday that any plans to have fans at home games this season were on indefinite hold.

The state collected tourism taxes and turned the money over to Benson. In 2002 and 2003, Benson received $12 million and $13 million. But trouble started in 2004, when Louisiana didn't have the $15 million to pay Benson by a mid-July deadline. While Louisiana officials found alternate revenue sources from which to pay just in time, had the state defaulted on the funding, Benson would have been free to engage other cities in talks about possibly moving his football team that September. The following year, Louisiana went through the same drill. Then Hurricane Katrina hit, and Benson was allowed to relocate his team temporarily to San Antonio, Texas. It was Paul Tagliabue, commissioner of the NFL at the time, who told Benson in no uncertain terms that he had to return to New Orleans in 2006 and Benson complied. Benson negotiated a post-Katrina deal and the old stadium was renovated. Foster may have been the first governor to pay to keep an owner in town.

Indian national security planners are considering a security architecture that weeds out inimical countries from participating in core economic sectors such as power, telecommunications and roads by verifying the origin and testing the reliability of imported equipment related to such sectors, officials aware of the development said.
 India will also forge collaborations in the development of critical technologies such as 5G and 5G-plus telecommunication standards through government-to-government or industry-to-industry partnerships rather than opt for off-the-shelf purchases of equipment in the future.
 The government will participate through the entire development process "so that it has the option to go for a different partner in case of any technology denial", said a senior government official involved in the move who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Foreign companies participating in Indian core sector will not be allowed to mask their origins and will have to go for full disclosure in case of any suspicion," the official added.
 While the Narendra Modi government is tight-lipped over the matter, the "verify the origin" debate started in July after China threw all past bilateral agreements out of the window and transgressed into eastern Ladakh, resulting in a tense military standoff that is yet to be resolved. The transgression and a June 15 clash in the Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian troops dead, besides an unspecified number of Chinese casualties, triggered calls for a boycott of Chinese products. Since then, the power ministry has decided to put in place specific testing guidelines that require the country of origin of imported equipment to be disclosed and to ensure that there is no malware embedded in critical sector equipment.
 "The new testing guidelines for power equipment are to ensure that the country of origin does not install a malware which can be activated to engineer a power crisis in India," said a senior power ministry official, requesting anonymity.
 Although national security planners and technology advisers to the Modi government are on the same page, there is a push-back from the telecommunication department and industry whose representatives believe alternative equipment will cost more, and want the government to define a threshold for disclosure of the country of origin.
 Even in developing the 5G and 5G-plus technologies, India is keen to find out the provenance of imported technology, with test-bed collaboration being the first step in confirming that imported telecommunication equipment is clean. While India is keen to collaborate in 5G with Japan, it has kept the option of choosing European and US telcos open in case of any opaqueness in joint ventures. In the past two decades, it has come to the notice of the government that foreign companies bidding for core sector contracts would often mask their country of origin through a third country and use state subsidies to emerge as the lowest price bidder and win the contract.

 NEW YORK — Sam Darnold was hoping the doctors would say something different. Instead, the New York Jets quarterback got the news he was dreading.

 Darnold, who was injured last Thursday night against Denver, is week to week. The team will see how the quarterback feels after he rests this week.

 District officials argued that the county's rules were confusing and could be read to allow far more people at indoor events than at outdoor ones. The revised health order treats indoor and outdoor gatherings the same.
 The judge denied the district's request for a temporary restraining order and set a hearing for this week, which was canceled after the county issued its revised health order.

A large chunk of the Garrett Bradley documentary "Time" (streaming Oct. 16 on Amazon Prime Video) is comprised of old home video footage of the Richardson family. Led by mother Sibil Fox Richardson and father Rob Richardson, the Richardsons lead a happy life. Their kids are bundles of happy energy. Sibil and Rob are affectionate with one another. With two more kids on the way, the Richardson family circa 1996 appears destined for a blissful life. However, the family is suffering from financial woes. There's seemingly no way out of their problems without drastic measures. Rob and Sibil proceed to engage in armed robbery of a credit union, for which they're both arrested.
   
 Sibil spends a handful of years in prison while Rob is sentenced to 60 years behind bars. Once she's out of jail, Sibil totally transforms her life. Now, her entire existence revolves around not only trying to get her husband an early release, but raising awareness of America's incarceration problem. She goes around as a public speaker talking about how the American prison system is meant to keep Black men in chains rather than its supposed mission of "reforming" people. Bradley's documentary cuts back and forth between home video footage of the past and newly captured footage of the present. In those glimpses into the past, we see the Richardson family expressing the kind of vibrant humanity that the American prison-industrial complex erases when it claims a person like Rob. He becomes a number, not the person seen in these home video tapes.
   
 To watch "Time" is to watch America's past, the present and terrifying future all at once. Rob is not an anomaly in this country. Just a few weeks ago, a verdict came down in regard to the death of Breonna Taylor that punished a police officer for putting bullets into walls rather than a human being. Once again, the humanity of a Black person is erased by systems that are supposedly designed to keep people safe. Within "Time," we see the toll this systemically ingrained corruption has on everyday people. But we also get to see how the Richardson family is responding to these horrors. "Time" lets the individual members of the Richardson family speak for themselves about how the imprisonment of Rob has inspired them to challenge the societal status quo.
   
 This is especially true for Sibil, who has spent well over a decade not only writing books and participating in speaking engagements; she's also been working tirelessly for her husband's early release from prison. That particular goal informs the strongest scene in all of "Time," which chronicles Sibil getting off the phone with an unhelpful figure. Finding herself at another dead end, she murmurs to herself, "Success is the best revenge." As she keeps repeating the phrase, she undergoes a whole array of emotions portrayed in a visceral manner. In the span of a single shot, she expresses simultaneous frustration, weariness, determination and sorrow over this entire situation. There's such a rawness to this moment that makes Sibil's struggles so palpable.
   
 Like all of the 1990's home video footage of the Richardson family, this moment of vulnerability from Sibil in "Time" radiates vigorous humanity. This quality is able to shine through so brightly, in part, due to Bradley's restrained but thoughtful approach in directing this documentary. She opts not to inundate the movie with ham-fisted narration or visual aids. Heck, even interviews with the camera (a staple of many documentaries) are kept to a minimum. Instead, Bradley keeps things simple and natural. Only the choice to film everything in a monochromatic hue (so as to create consistency with the black-and-white home video footage) deviates from the real world. Otherwise, "Time" opts for such authenticity that, frequently, the camera is observing events and people that seem totally oblivious to the presence of a documentary crew.
   
 "Time" engages in a style of filmmaking that evokes Barbara Kopple's "Harlan County, USA" in how it makes the viewer feel like they're in the same room as these real-life people. It's not like we're watching a film; we're observing reality as it unfolds. This subdued approach to filmmaking extends to the limited amount of people we meet throughout "Time." Bradley's camera only chronicles the Richardson family. Keeping the scope so limited allows us the opportunity to get so close to each of the people most impacted by Rob's incarceration. These immersive and richly human qualities of "Time" make it impossible not to become emotionally invested in this harrowing story. Bradley's work here lays bare the lives torn apart by the American prison system. "Time" is as well-crafted as it is tragically relevant.

With the Canada goose season in full swing, I would like to reflect on some of the changes I have observed in my 40-plus years of hunting. I started hunting Canada geese in the mid-70s. At that time, if you shot a Canada goose you were the envy of most area waterfowl hunters. There were fewer geese and very little water on the landscape compared to now. Because of the low goose numbers, hunting was only allowed until noon and Canada goose decoys were prohibited. My dad and I would use blue goose decoys to try to trick the Canada geese into coming close enough for a shot. We also hid in fence lines and slough edges trying to get a shot as the geese flew over, if we were in the right spot. Limited water on the landscape made it easier to pattern the geese coming off their roost and going to feed.
 In the 80s, Canada goose decoys became legal and our hunting tactics started to change. Decoying became more common, but we let them have their roosting areas and to feed in certain fields without bothering them. We often hunted between the two areas hoping they would keep using the same area; otherwise, they may move to a new area possibly miles away.
 The 90s resulted in a change across the landscape with the expansion of sloughs and wetlands from the above average precipitation. With more water on the landscape, the geese began to increase in numbers. It became tougher to pattern where the geese would roost at night because there were far more wetlands to choose from. This resulted in more decoying to hopefully increase our odds of having geese come in range for a shot. Generally, the geese would feed in the same field no matter where they roosted. In the 90s, we were able to hunt all day and the daily limit was five.

They're conducting drills, setting up command centers and warning the public. It comes in the wake of claims by President Donald Trump and his allies that the vote will be rigged and his call to supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully.” Tensions across America are high following increasing political polarization, and months of mass demonstrations against racial injustice that have seen violence by the left and right. Gun sales are way up. And extremist groups are emboldened after Trump told one group to “stand back and stand by."

Indian national security planners are considering a security architecture that weeds out inimical countries from participating in core economic sectors such as power, telecommunications and roads by verifying the origin and testing the reliability of imported equipment related to such sectors, officials aware of the development said.
 India will also forge collaborations in the development of critical technologies such as 5G and 5G-plus telecommunication standards through government-to-government or industry-to-industry partnerships rather than opt for off-the-shelf purchases of equipment in the future.
 The government will participate through the entire development process "so that it has the option to go for a different partner in case of any technology denial", said a senior government official involved in the move who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Foreign companies participating in Indian core sector will not be allowed to mask their origins and will have to go for full disclosure in case of any suspicion," the official added.
 While the Narendra Modi government is tight-lipped over the matter, the "verify the origin" debate started in July after China threw all past bilateral agreements out of the window and transgressed into eastern Ladakh, resulting in a tense military standoff that is yet to be resolved. The transgression and a June 15 clash in the Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian troops dead, besides an unspecified number of Chinese casualties, triggered calls for a boycott of Chinese products. Since then, the power ministry has decided to put in place specific testing guidelines that require the country of origin of imported equipment to be disclosed and to ensure that there is no malware embedded in critical sector equipment.
   
   
 "The new testing guidelines for power equipment are to ensure that the country of origin does not install a malware which can be activated to engineer a power crisis in India," said a senior power ministry official, requesting anonymity.
 Although national security planners and technology advisers to the Modi government are on the same page, there is a push-back from the telecommunication department and industry whose representatives believe alternative equipment will cost more, and want the government to define a threshold for disclosure of the country of origin.
 Even in developing the 5G and 5G-plus technologies, India is keen to find out the provenance of imported technology, with test-bed collaboration being the first step in confirming that imported telecommunication equipment is clean. While India is keen to collaborate in 5G with Japan, it has kept the option of choosing European and US telcos open in case of any opaqueness in joint ventures. In the past two decades, it has come to the notice of the government that foreign companies bidding for core sector contracts would often mask their country of origin through a third country and use state subsidies to emerge as the lowest price bidder and win the contract.

 Kansas football coach Les Miles has tested positive for COVID-19, he and athletic director Jeff Long announced Thursday.
 Miles, who will turn in 67 in November, is in his second season as KU coach.
 "Today, I was notified that I have tested positive for COVID-19. I am beginning the isolation process at my home and will continue to fulfill my head coach responsibilities remotely," Miles said in a statement.
 "Although I will not physically be able to attend practice for the time being, I will be using the technology available for remote working to stay connected during staff meetings, meetings with players, etc.," Miles added, noting, "Thank you for your prayers and support in advance. I look forward to beating this virus and returning back to be with my team in person very soon. Rock Chalk!"
 In his own statement, Long said: "Coach Miles has tested positive for COVID-19 through our surveillance testing. At this time, we believe he will be able to continue to perform his head coaching duties. Based on the other test results, no other coaches tested positive. As long as Coach Miles does not develop symptoms or have a fever, we anticipate he will be able to coach the West Virginia game on Oct. 17.

There's seating for seven; however, the second-row seat appears to be split 40/20/40, so we suspect the center section is removable, leaving two captain's chairs and improving third-row access. The SUV's conventional shifter has been replaced with a pushbutton unit, and its three-spoke steering wheel is shared with the TLX. We can also see a panoramic sunroof, aluminum speaker grilles, and multiple drive settings including Normal, Sport, and Individual.
 Consistently Acura's best-selling model, the MDX makes up nearly a third of its sales, so Honda's luxury brand has a lot riding on the redo of its largest SUV. Recently we published exterior spy shots of the SUV, which Acura says will be the new flagship of the brand. In those images it looks to be somewhat larger than the current model and is expected to share at least one of its engines with the recently introduced 2021 TLX. The 355-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 found in the sedan's Type S performance variant is a sure bet for the SUV, which is now powered exclusively by a naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V-6 that makes 290 hp. The MDX is also expected to get the latest version of Acura's SH-AWD system and a 10-speed automatic transmission. A hybrid model may follow down the road.
