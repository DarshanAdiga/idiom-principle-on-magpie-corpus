Living behind bars is expensive for inmates and their families, Dermody said. A 15-minute phone call with family members can cost more than $20 in some states, and inmates often must buy additional food to meet their nutritional needs.

October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and an opportune and necessary time to rededicate ourselves to the mission of ending domestic violence once and for all.


   


  According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, "Communities and advocacy organizations across the country connect with the public and one another throughout the month to raise awareness about the signs of abuse and ways to stop it, and to uplift survivor stories and provide additional resources to leaders and policymakers."


   


  Even if you're lucky enough not to have experienced such harm yourself, you almost certainly know or love someone who has. This violence isn't limited to any socioeconomic category or type of person. It can be glimpsed throughout society, in a multitude of ways.


   


  Unfortunately, the very basics of what domestic abuse is and how it works can make abuse difficult to eradicate.


   


  Those who endure it don't want to draw attention to themselves -- indeed, such attention could even be dangerous. The National Domestic Violence Hotline's website, for instance, includes an "X" that can be clicked to immediately close the page. And those who would hurt the ones they love are clearly not in a calm and welcoming state of mind. Abusers will go to great lengths to obscure what they do.


   


  Abuse itself is more complicated than simple physical violence. As Break the Cycle, an organization focused on younger people, puts it: "It's not just punches and black eyes -- it's yelling, humiliation, stalking, manipulation, coercion, threats and isolation. It's stealing a paycheck, keeping tabs online, non-stop texting, constant use of the silent treatment, or calling someone stupid so often they believe it."


   


  No one is alone in confronting domestic violence. The hotline can be contacted through its website at thehotline.org or by calling (800) 799-SAFE. In Kansas, the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence offers help at its website or at (888) END-ABUSE.


   


  These are challenging times for many of our friends and neighbors. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that families and other groups of people are spending extended periods of time together under one roof. That can increase the opportunities for abusers to take advantage of others. Additionally, economic instability can worsen the quality of life for everyone.


   


  But there is no reason, no excuse, to harm those who you claim to love. If you are suffering from domestic violence, or if you know someone who is, first of all stay safe. And then reach out to all of those willing to help you change your life.

A cover that features the cast of the ’60s American TV show _Bewitched_? On his own admission, Hervé Niquet takes a wry delight in cultural surprise with a ‘liking for things that are a bit … off the beaten track.’ _L’Opéra des Opéras_ is a collage of arias, choruses and orchestral interludes from almost a century of French Baroque opera with plenty of masters such as Lully, Charpentier Campra and Rameau rubbing shoulders with lesser-known composers Leclair, Montéclair and De Mondonville. As Niquet reminds us in a note in the programme booklet, there are clear precedents for such hybrid entertainments at Versailles in the reigns of the last three Bourbon kings of France.

Sayer’s is a clearly envisioned reading whose alert articulation helps to referee any detail-obscuring rivalry between the Harrison & Harrison instrument at full tilt and the vibrant acoustic. Incisive gestures and broad sweep characterise his approach to the Karg-Elert (whose pleading central ‘Canzone’ __ is plangently moulded), and the exuberant fireworks of Reger’s _Chorale Fantasia_ are navigated with easy bravado.

The Woodstock Hospital was recognized with an award for its effort to reduce spending by implementing a new program that saves $437,500 annually while quickly accessing patients' medical records.
 The project allowed the hospital to access paper patient records prior to 2005 - when they began using an electronic health records program - to help optimize patient care.
 According to a release, the ability to access new and old patient records electronically allows the hospital to get records quickly.
 "It was a challenge to access historical records because they were still on paper," Kathy Lavelle, the hospital's chief financial officer, stated in the case study.
 Previously, staff had to manually search for records, which caused longer wait times for patients.
 "It was causing significant delays for clinicians who needed the information to provide the best care possible."
 Under the former system, the hospital averaged 266 patient file requests each week and 370 requests per month from lawyers and insurance companies.
 More than 12-million pages were scanned to allow physicians to have immediate access to records when making diagnoses. According to the case study, the hospital now scans about 3,500 pages of patient records a day.
 The return on investment in the first three months from the initial costs was 258 per cent, the release highlighted.
 "They improved staff efficiency, boosted control of sensitive patient information and reduced the costs of managing their health-care records while supporting outstanding patient care in their emergency department," Barbara Peck, an analyst with Nucleus Research, noted.
 The award was announced last week at the 18th annual Technology Return on Investment awards in Colorado held by Nucleus Research.
 The award recognizes companies and businesses whose use of IT solutions help them financially with a positive return on investment.
 In a release, Nucleus Research stated 10 technology projects are selected each year based on the overall value from each individual project.
 An independent return-on-investment assessment is done to calculate the actual business benefits from each project.

It’s autumn and the leaves are changing colors. Despite how beautiful the colors may be, it is only a matter of time before they begin their downward spiral, fluttering to the ground to become a nuisance in the yard.


  Whether you use a leaf blower, a mower to mulch or children to rake piles leaves, the natural material can be used to prepare one's yard for next spring’s planting.


  The Outdoor Power Equipment Institute offers a few tips to get started. First, keep mowing. Tall grass can attract field mice while shorter grass is more resistant to diseases and traps fewer falling leaves, according to OPEI.


  After the leaves begin to fall there is more to be done. Some lawn mowers have mulch attachments that can be used to mulch leaves. Mulching leaves will mix them with cut grass. Grass provides nitrogen, which results in quicker composting and returning nutrients to the soil during the cooler months, OPEI states.


  Information from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources states leaves can be added to a stationary compost. This can be done by creating a storage container outside or a pile. Grass, if bagged, can be added to the compost and create the same effect as if they were mulched together in the yard.


  OPEI also suggests using the fall to attend to trees and bushes. Large cut branches can be used in outdoor or indoor fires while trimmings from bushes and smaller ones from trees can be added to the compost. Ashes from fire can be put in the compost as well.


  Other things that can be added to compost piles include food scraps, eggshells and coffee grounds.


  Once your compost is complete, it should have an earthy smell and look like dark, crumbly top soil according to a tip sheet by the NYC Compost Project at earthmatter.org.


  While compost piles are inclusive, it is wise to put newer additions to one side so that one may utilize the compost already created. According to the tip sheet, one should test compost by putting some in an air tight and sealed bag for three days. When it is open, it if it has a sour odor it is not ready.


  “Using ‘unfinished’ or immature material that contains food scraps can attract pests and can cause harm to young plants,” the tip sheet states, “so make sure your compost has fully decomposed before adding it to your garden beds.”


  Once it is ready, to use compost, sprinkle it on the top or mix it into a flower or garden bed. It also can be raked into tree beds or used in potted plants for indoor beauty. Earthmatter.org states compost can also be sprinkled throughout the yard to aid grass health.

The decision to finish the deal while the pandemic is still raging amounted to a tenuous balancing act. Kansas State still plans to furlough nearly 1,500 faculty and staff during this fiscal year, and the athletic department is still facing a significant budget shortfall. But the school also believes it has a winner in Klieman, and the contract extension not only reassures players and recruits that he's staying put but also makes it harder for a rival to lure him away.


--DocBreak--
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — It was some time in January when Kansas State athletic director Gene Taylor approached Chris Klieman about a contract extension, one that would include a raise that put him in the upper tier of Big 12 football coaches. The negotiations continued through February. They were almost done in March. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit. The men's and women's NCAA basketball tournaments were canceled, a big blow to the bottom line for many schools. Universities that included Kansas State began to furlough employees and dramatically cut back on expenses, wary that the virus could prevent college football from happening at all this fall. So yes, Klieman is keenly aware of the optics that come with his lucrative contract extension, which rather than being announced in April was finally disclosed Monday. He understands there are still plenty of people struggling to make ends meet, and he feels empathy for the hundreds of university employees still facing furloughs this fiscal year. “When the pandemic hit,” Klieman said Tuesday, “we kind of stopped everything. But then when we started playing football, I know it start back up with Kansas State and the representation I have, and it really for me starts in 2021. We still have our reduction of pay this fiscal year, and the timing isn't good all the time, but I appreciate the faith Gene has in me.” Klieman and basketball coach Bruce Weber agreed in late April to 13% pay cuts for the fiscal year beginning July 1, and those reductions remain in place. Under the new terms of his contract, Klieman will be paid base salaries of $3.1 million next season, $3.5 million in 2022, $4 million in 2023 and $4.3 million each year from 2024 to 2026. There also are retention bonuses of $200,000 in 2021 and $250,000 in...

Susan Page, the longtime Washington bureau chief for USA Today, will be in charge of keeping the candidates in line at the vice presidential debate Wednesday in Salt Lake City, where Vice President Mike Pence will face off against Sen. Kamala Harris of California.
 The sole showdown between running mates is typically the secondary act in the four events sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates in an election year. But the age of Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who will be 78 on inauguration day in 2021, and the health of 74-year-old Republican incumbent President Trump, released from the hospital Monday after contracting the coronavirus, has heightened the significance of the No. 2 spot on the ticket in the 2020 campaign.
 Page, 69, is a veteran White House reporter, who has covered six administrations and 11 national campaigns. She is the first print reporter to handle a televised presidential or vice presidential debate since 1976, when James Hoge, then-editor of the Chicago Sun-Times, moderated the matchup of VP contenders Walter Mondale and Robert Dole.

Garlanded with awards including a MacArthur ‘Genius’ fellowship, Jeremy Denk is a fine pianist and fluent essayist, and this compilation allows him free rein in both guises.

The invitation chimed with the way his thinking had been going. Wouldn’t it be wonderful, he thought, if he could convey the history of ‘so-called classical music’ in its whole sweep in just one sitting? ‘To get the perspective of time, to hear sounds and their priorities shifting.’

"articleBody": "(Gray News) - Legendary rock guitarist Eddie Van Halen has died at the age of 65, his son said Tuesday on Twitter.His son and band member in Van Halen, Wolfgang Van Halen, said on Twitter that his father had lost a long and arduous battle with cancer.“He was the best father I could ever ask for,” he said. “Every moment I’ve shared with him on and off stage was a gift.”Eddie Van Halen was a guitar virtuoso whose blinding speed, control and innovation propelled his band Van Halen into one of hard rock’s biggest groups, fueled the unmistakable fiery solo in Michael Jackson’s hit “Beat It” and became elevated to the status of rock god. He was 65With his distinct solos, Eddie Van Halen fueled the ultimate California party band and helped knock disco off the charts starting in the late 1970s with his band’s self- titled debut album and then with the blockbuster record “1984,” which contains the classics “Jump,” “Panama” and “Hot for Teacher.”Van Halen is among the top 20 best-selling artists of all time, and the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. Rolling Stone magazine put Eddie Van Halen at No. 8 in its list of the 100 greatest guitarists.Eddie Van Halen was something of a musical contradiction. He was an autodidact who could play almost any instrument, but he couldn’t read music. He was a classically trained pianist who also created some of the most distinctive guitar riffs in rock history. He was a Dutch immigrant who was considered one of the greatest American guitarists of his generation.pic.twitter.com/kQqDV7pulR&mdash; Wolf Van Halen (@WolfVanHalen) October 6, 2020

FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — A Texas man was charged with capital murder after police say he stole a woman's car and ran over and killed her 1-year-old son when he ambushed a custody meeting between the boy's parents. Fort Worth police said Nico Delafuente, 30, attempted the carjacking in the parking lot of Texas Health Huguley Hospital in Fort Worth. He was arrested Sunday. Zayden Mclean was rushed to the hospital but later died from his injuries. The child's mother and father, who share custody of the boy, were hospitalized with injuries not considered life-threatening. There was no indication Delafuente knew the boy or his parents, or that the carjacking was related to the custody handoff. Police said when Delafuente tried to drive off in the mother's vehicle, the child's father jumped in to stop him. The suspect reversed the car and hit the mother, who was holding Zayden, causing them both to fall on the ground. Delafuente ran over the child and crashed into a tree, police said. A hospital security guard took Delafuente into custody, and he was apprehended when police arrived. Vickie Bingham, the child's grandmother, told KDFW-TV that her daughter is still in the hospital. She is recovering from skull fractures, road rash and bleeding in her brain. “We just want prayers for our daughter and Zayden’s dad,” Bingham said. “They saw a lot, and they need prayers. They need healing.” The TV station also reported that Delafuente has also been charged with aggravated robbery and that he is being held at the Fort Worth jail on bonds totaling $600,000. The investigation is ongoing.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A U.S. judge says the IRS can’t keep withholding coronavirus relief payments from incarcerated people, potentially clearing the way for at least 80,000 checks totaling more than $100 million to be sent to people behind bars in the United States. The ruling gives the IRS until Oct. 24 to reconsider the payments for those who were denied or had their money intercepted solely because of their incarceration. But for incarcerated people who didn’t file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, another deadline is looming — they have until Oct. 15 to apply for the checks. The IRS and Treasury Department have not yet decided whether to pursue an appeal.

 Williams has a one-track mind: Basketball.
 The former St. Teresa basketball star who started his college career at the University of Iowa before graduating from Indiana State University signed a professional contract with Telstar Hesperange in Luxembourg, the first professional contract of his career, but doesn't intend to make his stay in the country permanent.
 This start to his career is simply that, a start, but one he's cherishing. He'll do a bit of sight-seeing — he tried once, but was out and about for three hours longer than planned as he tried to navigate the bus schedule in a new country — but he's ultimately there on business and to springboard to his next stop.

Foster claims championship to lead Salthawks at league


   


  MAIZE -- This Saturday at Wichita North, Hutchinson High School's Gracie Foster will look to defend her regional championship and make a repeat trip to the state tournament.


   


  But before Foster could turn her attention to regionals, she had business to take care of at the Ark Valley Chisholm Trail League Division I Championships.


   


  Foster was hardly tested en route to the league championship, winning all her sets without dropping more than two games in the process. Foster's league championship led the Salthawks to a third-place finish with 38 points.


   


  The Salthawks were not too far back from winning league. League-champions Salina South finished with 40 points, while Maize was the runner up with 39 points.


   


  Also in singles, Emilee Railsback rebounded from a quarterfinal defeat with back to back wins to end the day, finishing fifth in the process.


   


  In doubles, Libby Jackson and Tia Hines also rebounded from a quarterfinal match with back to back wins to take fifth. Jackson and Hines prevailed in a 6-1, 3-6, 10-7 win over Maize South's Maci Kratzer and Madelyn Fellows to advance to the fifth-place match.


   


  Rounding out the Hutchinson lineup were Lauren Davis and Darby Benson, who finished eighth. All four Hutchinson entries won their first match to ensure a top-eight finish.


   


  Hutchinson is headed to Wichita North for regionals this Saturday. The top four entries in singles and doubles reach the state tournament.


   


  Ferneau, Frederick lead Buhler at league


   


  BUHLER -- The doubles team of Jessi Ferneau and Olivia Frederick remained undefeated and captured the No. 2 title on Monday at the Ark Valley Chisholm Trail League Division III/IV Tournament on Monday.


   


  Ferneau and Frederick went 3-0 on the day, and defeated McPherson's Taylor Berger and Maddie Dobson in the championship by a 3-6, 7-5, 11-9 score.


   


  The No. 1 doubles team of Kayla Babcock and Alex Hutton went 2-1 for third. After losing in a super tiebreaker in the semifinals, Babcock and Hutton rebounded by defeating the No. 1 team from Wichita Collegiate 6-0, 6-2 in the third-place match.


   


  In singles, both Brittany Teufel at No. 1 and Kacey Lehl at No. 2 went 1-2 for fourth. Teufel and Lehl each won their first match in straight sets before ending the day with back to back losses.


   


  As a team, Buhler finished with 49 points for third place. Wichita Collegiate placed second with 51, and McPherson won league with 60 points.


   


  Buhler will get one more chance to play at home this season on Saturday when the Crusaders host one of four Class 4A Regionals. The top four entries from singles and doubles reach the state tournament.

“The Court finds that the rulings on the four patents that were found infringed and valid were clear and not a close call,” Judge Morgan wrote in his 178-page opinion. “The Court finds that Cisco did not advance any objectively reasonable defenses at trial as to the four infringed and valid patents…the infringing functionality was added to their accused products…and resulted in a dramatic increase in sales which Cisco touted in both technical and marketing documents.”


  Jonathan Rogers, chief operating officer at Centripetal, said the company’s “intelligence drive security” software typically sits on top of networking infrastructure to protect client networks. He said the company’s client list includes hospitals, internet infrastructure providers, online retailers, power plants and government agencies.


  Cisco said it plans to appeal the ruling.


  “We are disappointed with the trial court’s decision given the substantial evidence of non-infringement, invalidity and that Cisco’s innovations predate the patents by many years,” Cisco said in a statement in response to the verdict. “We look forward to the Federal Circuit’s review on appeal.”
