England were absolutely dire (no not Eric) in the first-half, they failed to create any clear-cut chances and only headed into the break on level terms thanks to Meunier’s blunder.
 The Three Lions looked much better in the second period of the game though, with much more creativity across the board, Harry Kane and Rashford both had solid chances after the 80th minute.
 Regardless, the decision to deploy three centre-backs and wing-backs is shaping up to be a pretty worrying tactic, with a lack of drive and creativity the prime concern with this system.
 It’s clear that the players need more time and experience to settle into this 5-2-3 formation, but is some of the criticism towards Southgate unwarranted? England did just beat a quality side after all.
 As much as some of the player selections may have worried fans, considerable rotation was expected ahead of what was England’s second fixture in a break that will see them play three times.
 Hopefully, the tie against Denmark on Wednesday night will give fans a clearer idea of what England’s starting lineup will look like ahead of next summer’s Euros.

This time, while the focus was on upping his style quotient, the stylist was also responsible to ensure Bachchan's safety. Due to the safety guidelines in place which include sanitization and physical distancing, Patil did away with tie knots for the actor this year. Last year, Bachchan had experimented with tie knots including the eldredge, trinity and rose knots. Patil said that since they are practicing social distancing on the sets, they introduced brooches and collar pins instead as they can be sanitized as well.

Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Minister Gulabrao Patil on Sunday lent further credence to the speculation of estranged senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse's possible defection, remarking that it was true that Mr. Khadse would be changing his political colours soon.
 Mr. Patil, an MLA from the Jalgaon Rural constituency and Minister of State for Water Supply and Sanitation, said he was not aware of which party the BJP leader would eventually join or of whom he was in touch with.
 “While I do not know who Eknath Khadse is in touch with at the moment, it certainly is true that he will change his party,” said Mr. Patil, while responding to questions whether the disgruntled Mr. Khadse would be joining Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) or the Sena.
 Since the past few days, rumours have been swirling thick and fast that Mr. Khadse would be entering the NCP fold. It was even rumoured that Mr. Khadse would be meeting with Mr. Pawar while he was in Mumbai recently. The BJP leader, however, refused to comment on the matter after his return to Jalgaon on Sunday.
 Sena leaders like Abdul Sattar, Uday Samant and Mr. Patil himself, have been urging Mr. Khadse, a stalwart leader from north Maharashtra, to join the Sena.
 After being denied a ticket in the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls and following the defeat of his daughter Rohini Khadse in the same election, Mr. Khadse has been vocal about his disenchantment with his party.
 Since the conclusion of the Assembly polls, a major schism has emerged within the Maharashtra BJP leadership with the top brass fearing a possible intra- party revolt by notable OBC leaders led by Mr. Khadse, former ministers Pankaja Munde and Prakash Mehta, and other leaders who were either denied a ticket or suffered upset defeats in the election.
 Mr. Khadse was reportedly upset with then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, the BJP’s leader in the State, for his ‘authoritarian style’ of running the party and eliminating potential ‘rivals’ in a Machiavellian fashion.
 At the time, the OBC leaders had blamed Mr. Fadnavis for engineering their defeats and denying them tickets. Mr. Khadse has consistently maintained that there had been a ‘conspiracy’ by certain leaders in the State BJP unit to ensure the defeats of Ms. Munde and his daughter, Rohini, and that the move was aimed at finishing off his political career.
 Since then, rumours have been circulating of his potential defection to either the Sena or the NCP.

Posting only 47 receiving yards, Pitts’ only connection with Trask that led to a touchdown was a pass from the Gator’s opening drive. Rather than Pitts dominating the stat sheet for the Gators, senior Kadarius Toney was Florida’s leading receiver with 92 yards.
 Senior linebacker Buddy Johnson said the defense focused on shutting Pitts down.
 “Kyle Pitts, he’s a great player,” Johnson said. “We took him out of the game. He’s a big thing for their offense. We forced Kyle [Trask] to make other throws.”
 Florida’s Kyle duo was overshadowed by a different connection — one between A&M senior quarterback Kellen Mond and sophomore running back Isaiah Spiller. Mond passed the ball off to Spiller to run it into the endzone twice. Their second connection was a turning point in the game, as it was early in during the fourth quarter and gave A&M its first lead of the game, 31-28.
 A&M coach Jimbo Fisher said Spiller had a great game.

FALL RIVER - Hang tight, all you drivers heading north on William S. Canning Boulevard en route to SouthCoast Marketplace.
 It won't be long before your final approach to the popular shopping center in the city's far South End becomes easier and safer.
 Preliminary work is now underway to construct a slip ramp, also known in the parlance of road construction as either a slip lane or slip road.
 "It will alleviate congestion and improve access to SouthCoast Marketplace," said Paul Ferland, who oversees Fall River's sewer and water divisions in his role as the city's community utilities administrator.
 Ferland says the new ramp, or lane, will sit parallel to the shopping center's main entrance-and-exit road and will run adjacent to the Santander Bank branch.
 The new road will be functional before the arrival of Thanksgiving on Nov. 26, he said.
 Ferland said northbound and southbound drivers exiting nearby Route 24 will appreciate the road addition, as will people driving in from Tiverton and down the Canning Boulevard/Route 81 hill from the Stafford Road rotary.
 The new entrance road will eliminate the need for northbound traffic to swerve into the right-hand lane to enter the shopping center -- which in turn should create a more orderly and safer two-lane path for drivers heading past SouthCoast Marketplace.
 "I know a lot of people will be happy when this is done," said John Perry, director of the city's Department of Community Maintenance.
 Ferland said the state's Department of Transportation has approved plans and designs for two new, large traffic signal lights to be installed at the intersection in front of SouthCoast Marketplace.
 He says synchronization of the lights will be fine-tuned to create a more orderly flow of traffic from various turn lanes.
 Another road improvement soon to be undertaken will be the extension of the left-turn lane onto Newton Street from northbound vehicles on Canning Boulevard, which Ferland says will be accomplished by utilizing portions of the existing median.
 "It will help avoid having traffic backing up into the high speed lane," Ferland said.
 Up until now, he said, it's been a case of "too much traffic in an under- designed intersection."
 Ferland, 37, said the slip lane is more or less the icing on the cake of a $5 million project on the boulevard that started a year ago.
 In addition to roadway repaving it's also included the replacement of old and antiquated stormwater mains with new pipes.
 Those water mains, Ferland said, run south from Tucker Street to Newton Street, the latter of which ends as it intersects Canning Boulevard at the entrance to SouthCoast Marketplace.
 New stormwater infiltration devices, or basins, that drain water directly into the ground -- to lessen the burden on the city's sewer and wastewater system -- have been installed, as have 500 linear feet of piping running from catch basins to the infiltration area.
 The boulevard drainage system, which includes catch basins, manholes and pipes, ties into the sewer main on Tucker Street.
 Ferland stresses that the improvements made last winter to the drainage system were an important step in eliminating flooding during and after high-intensity rainstorms.
 He said the section of Canning Boulevard that runs in front of CVS on one side and the First Ford auto dealership on the other had for many years been prone to severe flooding, often resulting in a road closure and detours.
 The road paving improvement project has also included the installation of new sidewalks and bike lanes, Ferland said.
 He said the road and wastewater improvement project was made possible by a $2 million MassWorks state grant awarded to the city three years ago.
 Ferland said the grant was awarded based on the development of Southcoast Marketplace and other retail-oriented, economic development improvements -- including the opening of a new Ocean State Job Lot store on the opposite side of Canning Boulevard.
 "The MassWorks grant was the driver for the project," he said.
 "We," he said, meaning the city, "piggybacked on their construction project."
 Ferland said the sewer department enterprise fund, which utilizes fees paid by city residents, provided the $2.5 million needed for the drainage improvements.
 He says the city eventually received a $400,000 grant as part of the state's Complete Streets Funding Program, which MassDOT says is intended for "technical assistance and construction."
 Ferland said the nearly $5 million contract was awarded to K.R. Rezendes Inc. of Assonet. He said the local construction company handled the drainage work and hired subcontractors to do the paving.
 He also said the property owner of SouthCoast Marketplace is covering some of the cost of the new slip ramp.
 Ferland was appointed community utilities administrator a year ago when his predecessor Terrence Sullivan retired.
 He says former city engineer Byron Holmes, who retired in 2016, has provided consulting services for the William S. Canning improvement project.
 Fall River has lacked a full-time engineer since JR Frey left earlier this year for a similar job in Hingham.
 DCM director Perry said it may or may not be obvious to most drivers, but the right-turn entrance off of southbound Canning Boulevard into the Fall River Shopping Center parking lot has been shortened and widened for ease of use and safety.
 Perry, 45, has worked for the city for 21 years and headed up DCM during the past four years.
 "We're on the home stretch now, which is great," he said, referring to the Canning Boulevard improvement project.
 "It's been a collaborative effort," he added.

 “We really get to focus on our development for one thing,” Guerrieri said. “We also get a chance to do deep dives into what the other team is doing.”
 Lopez said this weekend’s matchup will be especially interesting because Florida shares a similar play style.

Torreira slipped down the pecking order in his second season at Arsenal, starting only 23 of his 39 appearances across all competitions last term.


  Mikel Arteta secured a quality defensive midfield option with a shock Deadline Day swoop for Thomas Partey, at least Diego Simeone hasn’t been left too stuck with Torreira joining on loan.


  According to the Metro via Sport890, Torreira’s agent has claimed that the loan deal doesn’t include a permanent option – in a potentially massive boost for the Gunners.


  The 24-year-old still has plenty of time to prove himself as a key player for the Gunners in the future, Torreira really went above and beyond with this classy message after leaving for Atletico on loan.
