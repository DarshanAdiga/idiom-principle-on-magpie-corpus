True, there were a few instances of imperfections in the coverage of the elections. But these imperfections did not, and cannot, obscure the fact that the media generally excelled of which Ghanaians must be proud. More pointedly, nothing justifies the verbal attacks, blazing threats and cyber-bullying being perpetrated against certain journalists and media houses for performing their electoral duty and executing their constitutional mandate. The anti-media brew which is bubbling in certain political circles is inimical to press freedom and dangerous to our democracy. This must stop forthwith. We also demand that it is time for conscientious and dutiful citizens of this country to rise and defend the media from any ‘bullet attacks’ and ‘bloodshed calls’ targeted at journalists.
