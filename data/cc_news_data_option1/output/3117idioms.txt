Not bad. McCoy, who graduated in 2017, wasn't just a two-way player, he was a quarterback who played both ways consistently and impacted the game on both sides of the ball.
 But we're not done yet.
 McCoy was his team's kicker as well, booting 103 kickoffs in two seasons with 23 touchbacks. He also punted 90 times for 3,000 yards, pinning 18 kicks inside the 20-yard line.
 McCoy didn't just handle kickoffs, he was also a kick returner. He compiled 682 kick return yards with a kick return touchdown. He also returned a fumble for a touchdown and another touchdown on an interception return.

Law360 (August 7, 2020, 8:32 PM EDT) -- The Eighth Circuit on Friday undid a lower court's invalidation of several anti-abortion laws in Arkansas, finding that Chief Justice John Roberts' pivotal vote in a recent U.S. Supreme Court case requires the lower court to evaluate the laws under a different approach.      A three-judge panel vacated a lower court's preliminary injunction against the four laws, and said the lower court needs to take another look at the law in light of Justice Roberts' recent concurring opinion in June Medical Services v. Russo, in which he and four other justices wiped out a Louisiana law that would have required abortion doctors...

Facebook's founder and CEO Zuckerberg fears that the US sanctions against TikTok will be imposed on Facebook's social media platforms in other countries. For example, after this decision, many other countries may shut down Instagram or ask them to sell their operation rights to a company in their country, claiming that Facebook shared personal information with the US government. While this may not be the case in the short term, it may hurt Facebook's head in the long term.

The project is absolutely a lot more arranged than it was when it released in July, by means of a tweet from West.

There is an indisputable rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts and experts say action needs to be taken immediately before the state is forced to revive restrictions or enter another lockdown due to a second surge.
 The Department of Public Health reported 438 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday -- the highest single-day increase in two months. Of the 15,316 people tested, 2.8 percent were positive for the coronavirus, above the 2.2 percent seven-day weighted average, which has crept up from a low of 1.7 percent in mid-July.
 "I think these are numbers that should certainly concern us about a surge coming," said Samuel Scarpino, head of Northeastern University's Emergent Epidemics Lab. "Part of the reason for us to take action now is we may still be able to prevent a large surge by taking targeted, careful action today. If we wait until the percent positivity rate is over 5 percent and ICUs are filling up, we have fewer options and may have to go the unfortunate route of a lockdown."

 The recent increase in cases is alarming, the experts say, but many of them say they began noticing community transmission increasing a couple of weeks ago.
 Dr. David Rosman, president of the Massachusetts Medical Society and a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, called the rise in cases "very concerning" and said he began expressing worry two weeks ago when he noticed common daily increases of more than 200 cases, which has occurred 10 times in 14 days.
 "It's impossible not to see the individual daily number, but it's undoubted as we look at the trends that the trend is in the wrong direction and now has been for quite some time," he said.
 Rosman says it's time to act before things get worse. He has floated the idea of returning to Phase 2 of Massachusetts' reopening, which could mean closing indoor dining, gyms and fitness studios, movie theaters, outdoor performance venues, museums, casinos and possibly even stopping professional sports.
 "When you look at trends, the positive test rate has been going up ever since around July 11, which suggests a full three-week trend of upward weighted average. That can't be a spurious result. It has to be real. We need to respond to that," he said. "The governor has said we need to be wearing masks and following the rules. What's not clear is whether the rules of Phase 3 are too lax or we're in Phase 3 and people aren't following the new rules and they're treating it like it's the new normal. We aren't in the new normal."
 Dr. Ingrid Theresa Katz, an associate faculty director at the Harvard Global Health Institute and an associate physician in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said she believes it's time to go back to Phase 2 and "shut this down before it gets worse."
 "I feel strongly that the reopening of schools should be the number one priority, and the background rates matter here. If community cases continue to rise, we run the risk of having much higher background rates by the time schools open in a month," she said. "It is important to bear in mind that growth is exponential, so a small blip now means much larger numbers later. We want to avoid the surge, and these rising positivity rates are early warning signs."
 Scarpino said it's difficult to say whether the increase in cases is due to the state's reopening without further information on how transmission is happening. It's important for the state to release additional data on whether cases are connected to things like youth sporting events, gyms or large parties, he said.
 "I think what we can see is that things were working back in Phase 2. Now we're heading in the wrong direction," he said. "Something has changed in the past two or three weeks since new things came online."
 Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday, prior to the state reporting a recent single- day high in coronavirus cases, that he would consider reviving business restrictions if the cases continue to mount.
 "We've only had a slight uptick from a low of 1.7 percent to 2 percent, but we'll be forced to adjust our plans if the data warrants it," Baker said. "That could mean gathering sizes could be reduced or we could make some of our business regulations more strict. Reopening and staying open is obviously a big part of the goal, but obviously, we can't do that if we don't have everybody's help to continue to move forward."
 The increase in cases comes on a week when many school committees across the state are voting on how students will return this fall. Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Jeffrey C. Riley said Tuesday that the "vast majority" of school districts prefer a hybrid model of part-time in-person learning, supplemented by remote instruction.
 But the experts warn that the current work being put into school reopening decisions could be a moot point come mid-September if the current trends of COVID-19 continue.
 "To safely send kids back to school, the numbers need to be low and they need to be headed down," Rosman said. "For the numbers to be climbing right now is a likely indication that it will be very difficult for schools to open for in- person attendance."
 Scarpino agrees that the current coronavirus trends in Massachusetts don't look positive for people hoping to send their children back to school buildings.
 "Certainly, if the numbers continue in the direction they are headed now, there won't be a safe way to reopen schools," he said.
 In an attempt to keep COVID-19 transmission levels as low as possible in Massachusetts, a travel ban went into effect Saturday that requires residents visiting from most states to quarantine for 14 days or produce a negative coronavirus test result within 72 hours prior to arriving in the state.
 Residents of lower-risk states, currently consisting of most of the Northeast, are exempt. Massachusetts announced Tuesday that Rhode Island will be added to the state's quarantine list as of Friday due to "increases in both RI's positive test rate and cases per 100,000."
 "This is all very difficult," Scarpino said. "It's hard on everybody -- it's hard on families and children. That's why it's so important to understand where cases are coming from and take thoughtful action now to bring this under control while still having the best possible quality of life we can given how horrific this disease is."

After a lockdown that began on March 15 and was on and off, then on and off again, the government has decided to reopen the country in order to allow business to function once more. This decision comes in the wake of a sharp drop in Covid-19 cases. While there are more than 20,000 active cases in the country only 1300 are currently being treated at hospitals and the major health disaster that had been feared has, at least for now, apparently been warded off through the efforts of the NCOC and the prime minister’s health team. The federal government has stated that restaurants, cafes, tourist spots, hotels, sports venues, recreational centers, transport and other facilities will reopen by August 10. Asad Umar who heads the NCOC has stated that relevant SOPs will be issued. In public transport a distance between passengers will be maintained, possibly till October and a final decision on the reopening of schools on September 15 will be taken after another meeting on September 7 to review the situation.

As of right now, Pitt will open its season on Saturday, Sept. 12 against the Miami (Ohio) Redhawks. However, the Mid-American Conference, of which Miami is a member, has yet to announce its plans for a football season this fall, with some speculation it could be pushed to spring. Another meeting of the MAC school presidents will be held Friday.
 The Panthers will play their first four games at home. Following the opener against the Redhawks, they’ll face Syracuse on Sept. 19, Louisville on Sept. 26, and North Carolina State on Oct. 3.
 Pitt's second game could also be in jeopardy. Syracuse players did not report to practice on Thursday, citing concerns over playing during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Stephen Bailey of Syracuse.com, players are comfortable with the safety protocols put into place by the university, but are concerned about the protocols at other ACC schools and at its one nonconference opponent, Liberty.
 Pitt will hit the road to face Boston College on Oct. 10 then head to Miami a week later. It will return home on Oct. 24 to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The Panthers will be off Halloween weekend before facing Florida State on Nov. 7. It will be Pitt's first game in Tallahassee since the 1982 season, when Dan Marino led the Panthers to a 37-17 win. The following week, Pitt will face Georgia Tech in Atlanta.
 The Panthers return to Pittsburgh for their final home game on Nov. 21 when the Virginia Tech Hokies come to town. Pitt wraps up the 2020 season with a big matchup at the Clemson Tigers. The Panthers are the last team to beat Clemson in Death Valley, a 43-42 victory that came in 2016.
 The preseason Coaches’ Poll was also released on Thursday. Among Pitt’s opponents, three are currently ranked – No. 1 Clemson, No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 24 Virginia Tech.

The final baseball game played at Hobart-Detter Field this summer came down to the wire, and the majority of the fans in attendance went home happy.
   
 Despite a three-run eighth inning from the Hattiesburg BlackSox, the Hutchinson Monarchs held on for a 5-4 win Thursday night in an elimination game in the NBC World Series.
   
 The Monarchs entered the top of the eighth with a 5-1 lead. A two-run home run from Hattiesburg's Pablo Lanzarote was followed up by a solo home run by Walker Burchfield to cut the deficit to one.
   
 Hutchinson pitcher Foster Gifford responded from allowing back-to-back home runs with back-to-back strikeouts to end the inning.
   
 "I knew if Gifford could get us to the ninth, we would have Aaron in the ninth," Hutchinson manager Deron McCue said. "That's a pretty good combination."
   
 After a scoreless bottom half of the eighth, the Monarchs turned to closer Aaron Haase for three outs in a one-run game. A defensive error from the Monarchs with one out put the go-ahead run at first base, but that runner was stranded there as Haase calmly took care of business.
   
 "This is what baseball is all about this time of year," McCue said. "We have a good bullpen, we have a lot of arms left, so we're going to try and make a run here."
   
 Hutchinson starter Liam Eddy pitched five scoreless innings and struck out five for the win. Hattiesburg starter Tre Hobbs had a no-hitter going through three innings, but ran into trouble in the fifth.
   
 In the fourth inning, a two-out RBI single by Taylor Barber scored Dylan Nedved to put the Monarchs up, 1-0.
   
 A four-run fifth inning began with a Clayton Chadwick infield single, followed by an Anthony Mackenzie walk. Chadwick and Mackenzie pulled off a successful double steal, which put both runners in scoring position and allowed Jack Siegriest to score them both with an RBI double that barely remained fair down the right-field line.
   
 Still with no outs, Tanner White drilled a two-run home run that gave the Monarchs a 5-0 lead, and chased Hobbs out of the ball game.
   
 Down 5-0, the BlackSox went to work.
   
 An RBI single to right field by Jaylyn Williams put Hattiesburg on the board in the sixth. Relief pitcher Landon Tomkins kept Hutchinson off the scoreboard for 3.1 innings which kept Hattiesburg in the game.
   
 Hattiesburg's Trey Jones led off the top of the eighth with a walk, and Lanzarote promptly scored him with a home run. Burchfield followed suit with a solo home run to cut the deficit to 5-4, but the BlackSox could never score the tying run.
   
 "The resiliency of this group is what is so impressive," Hattiesburg manager Trey Aby said. "That's what baseball is. You're going to fail more times than you're going to succeed in baseball."
   
 Hattiesburg out-hit Hutchinson by a 9-5 margin, but the Monarchs made their hits count.
   
 "They're a good hitting team," McCue said. "They out-hit us tonight, but we got some clutch hits."
   
 The Monarchs move on to face the Hays Larks at 8:30 p.m. Friday at Wichita State. Hutchinson concludes the 2020 summer season with a 19-2 record, NBC World Series included, at Hobart-Detter Field.
   
 "I'm going to remember all the guys we've been playing with, all the friends we've made, all the games we won," Barber said. "There's nothing like [Hobart- Detter Field]. Coming out in front of 400-500 fans every night, it gets you really excited to come to the park every day, and we like to put on a good show for them."
   
 "I've never been on a summer club that's been this competitive," said Nedved. "Everybody loves to win, and it was a lot of fun this summer.
   
 "It's a really great atmosphere, and I'm really going to miss it."
   
 Hattiesburg makes the trip back to Mississippi after going 1-2 at the World Series.
   
 "This has been a great experience," Aby said. "Everybody has been so nice. This is a great field. We'll be back next year for sure, absolutely."

The buzz over whom former Vice President Joe Biden will pick for his vice presidential candidate has been circulating for months. He has committed to selecting a woman as his running mate. While there are many well-qualified women candidates, there are a number of ethnic groups who are pulling for a candidate of color.
 During this moment of civil unrest, there is excitement that protesters of all colors and faiths are joining together to bring attention to police brutality. Not only can America make history by having its first woman vice president, but also a Black woman could follow the first Black president, Barack Obama. There are so many people who would not have thought of the possibility of a Black president and a Black female vice president who could become president one day.
 Biden should chose who he feels is ready to become president day one. The joy that former first lady Michelle Obama brought to young girls, who saw a highly educated woman in the White House, was monumental. Women have long played the supporting role in this country, and I feel it is time for more women leaders. The idea of a woman vice president is exiting and motivating, but I am ready for a woman president, as well. For a woman to be a heartbeat from the presidency is something to witness.
 So whom should Biden choose for his running mate? What qualities are we looking for in a vice president? How will she navigate the Middle East, Russia, China and Africa, where women in leadership are not a common occurrence? How will she help Biden unify the country? She will have her hands full, but that comes with the job, and I am sure she will be up to the task.

Following over 100 millimeter rain recorded in past 24 hours in various costal districts and nearly 40-70mm in parts of core cotton belt of Sindh, farmers sound alarm bells about possible adverse effect on output of kharif (summer) crops. There is prediction of rain spells in main cotton growing region located in southern Punjab in next couple of days. The current rainfall has been stated to occur in Balochistan during Friday to Sunday, posing threat to plants.
 Rain and gusty winds are plummeting otherwise dry and parched but hard soils as monsoon low pressure from Bay of Bengal hovering over Sindh since Thursday night is going to collide with westerly moist wave. Under the influence of this rare weather system in this part of the country, strong monsoon currents are penetrating in Sindh, southern Punjab and eastern Balochistan. The handshake of easterly and westerly monsoon currents in lower and central parts are rare but whenever it happens it proves catastrophic in terms of negative impact of rains and gusty winds on standing crops. Heavy downpour may generate flash flooding in streams of Balochistan and Sulaiman range in South Punjab, ravaging crops and orchards in nearby fields.
 During the past 36 hours, rain/wind-thundershowers occurred in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Hot and very humid weather prevailed elsewhere in the country. Karachi received up to 94mm downpour Shaheed Benazirabad 47mm, Sakrand 35mm, Badin 36mm, Rohri 28mm, Hyderabad 27mm, Tando Jam 26mm, Sukkur 24mm, Padidan 21mm, Thatta 15 in Sindh while Rahim Yar Khan in Punjab received 20mm rain while 17mm rain was registered in Khuzdar, Balochistan.
 “Moderate to intense rain for longer period could prove devastating for cotton crop,” said Hassan Ali Chaniho, a former agriculture minister in Sindh. “Farmers should do everything to drain standing water in case of heavy rains and make arrangements to protect the plants from the harmful effects. The persistent waterlogging of soil may rot plant roots, suffocating the healthy plant in no time.”
 Chaniho, a grower himself who hails from Sanghar, the prime cotton producing district of Sindh, lamented that rain has been continuing in this district since late afternoon, which is too much for cotton crop sown in this otherwise dry part of the country.
 “Moreover, shedding and lodging are other likely outcome of such hazardous weather for cotton flowers, bolls and even for whole plant,” he said. “Raindrops falling into opened cotton bolls used to have negatively effect on lint colour, degrading its quality.”
 Rain is not a welcome thing even in short spells as it brings muggy weather which is ideal for infestation of pests, added.
 Before rains, cotton crop was not in a very good shape despite greater area under cultivation this year. Pest attack is on the rise so does the prevalence of cotton leaf curl virus in patches.
 “Rain would be a boon for most of other summer crops including sugarcane and rice,” Chaniho said.
 Khalid Khokhar, president of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad said there was rampant attack of whitefly and now greater humidity would invite pests in addition to physical damages to cotton plants.
 “Farmers of cotton are already in demoralising mood due to non-favourable policies of the federal and provincial governments and now menace of unfavorable weather would likely to wreak havoc to cotton crop, which is a cash crop and main raw material for textile sector,” said Khokar. “Sowing of autumn maize may also be delayed by rain spell.”
 In a world of global warming, Khokar said, heavy or prolonged rain triggered climatic factors such as temperature, wind, rainfall and humidity. “These abiotic stresses not only physically damaged plant but significantly affect the flower and boll production of cotton.”
 On the flip side, rain is very much beneficial for replenishing groundwater and water reservoirs like small dams, lakes and ponds. It will help significantly filling Hub dam in Balochistan and many other small and micro water storing infrastructure and tend to increase water level of aquifer.

The annihilation of the port in Tuesday´s explosion has further strained food access for a population that relies on imports for 85 percent of what it eats.
 That includes wheat to produce staple flat bread, mandatory at every Lebanese meal and now sold at the state-subsidised price of 2,000 Lebanese pounds per 900-gramme-bag.
 "When we saw the silos, we panicked," said Ghassan Bou Habib, CEO of Lebanon´s Wooden Bakery pastry franchise.
 Some 15,000 tonnes of wheat, corn and barley were blasted out of the towering 55-year-old silos and a nearby mill was destroyed.
 At least one ship unloading wheat during the explosion was damaged, its stocks inedible.
 Lebanese bread makers and consumers fear the loss of the 120,000-tonne capacity silos will compound months of wheat worries, making bread harder to produce and ultimately more expensive for a population that has already seen its purchasing power slashed.
 A liquidity crisis since the autumn saw banks halt dollar transfers abroad, which hampered imports.
 Container activity had already declined by 45 percent in the first half of 2020 compared to last year, according to Blominvest Bank, while the staggering devaluation of the Lebanese pound led to major price hikes.
 "We were already struggling with the (little) wheat and flour that were available. The mills weren´t getting enough or they didn´t have fuel to run," Bou Habib said.
 Even before the explosion, Wooden Bakery´s 50 branches were only getting two- thirds of the 70 tonnes of flour they need daily.
 "Now, our central kitchen isn´t producing enough to fill shelves," said Bou Habib.
 The day after the blast, hundreds of customers flocked to the Al-Kaboushieh Bakery in Beirut´s Hamra district to stock up on bread.
 "Were completely sold out. Everyone was buying five bags instead of one in case there´d be no more," said employee Hayder Mussawi.
 "Bread is the only way the poor get full: we´re not sitting eating steak with a fork and knife," he told AFP.
 Officials have tried to mollify fears of shortages, saying wheat already in the country would last a month and new shipments would arrive this week at Lebanon´s two other ports, Tripoli in the north and Sidon in the south.
 But they lack silos, pointed out Moussa Khoury, a farming entrepreneur who ran Beirut´s grain storage from 2014 to 2017. "There´s nothing like Beirut port, where grain was being unloaded from ships or pulled from the silos 24 hours a day," Khoury told AFP.
 He agreed shops wouldn´t immediately see bread shortages but said "enormous problems" would begin to appear in the coming months.
 "Smaller ports in Tripoli and Sidon means lengthier and costlier offloading," which could be added to consumer prices, Khoury said.
 Mill owners have already calculated that trucking wheat 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Tripoli to Beirut would cost an extra $6 per tonne, said Arslan Sinno, president of Lebanon´s Dora Mills.
 "Who will pay for that? Us?" Sinno asked bitterly.
 Sinno told AFP stocks in the silos and mills had already been low because of delays by the central bank in paying foreign suppliers.
 "Other suppliers may not want to come anymore because of security concerns," he said. The United Nations is also sounding the alarm, warning on Thursday that with the port unusable, food prices would soar "beyond the reach of many".
 For months, initiatives like the Lebanese Food Bank (LFB) have been distributing baskets to desperate families, including bread donated by some of the mills and bakeries now hard-hit.
 Since Tuesday´s blast, LFB volunteers have gone into overdrive, giving out sandwiches and snacks to families whose homes were damaged, said Suha Zaiter, LFB´s executive manager.
 More than 10,000 people have donated online, while others have provided cash or in-kind contributions to help those affected.
 "People don´t have time to cook right now as they´re cleaning their houses," said Zaiter.
 But even her initiative may feel the pinch.
 One bakery was donating 500 bags of bread a day to LFB before the explosion, but told the group it could not boost the donation given the wheat shortage.
 "We were already dealing with COVID-19 and the economic crisis, then this disastrous day happened," Zaiter told AFP. "It´s the cherry on top of the cake."

The prison's cases, which pushed Cambria County to a one-day record of 30 cases on Wednesday, represented a significant part of a continued surge in the county, as shown in Friday’s update of the Department of Health's COVID-19 Early Warning Monitoring System Dashboard.
 Although Gov. Tom Wolf and Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine on Friday used the dashboard to show progress in the fight to contain the coronavirus pandemic, Cambria County’s report showed increases across the board. The dashboard compares COVID-19 reports for the past seven days to the previous seven days.
 It shows Cambria had 28 more new cases this past week – a total of 69 new cases for July 31-August 6, up from 41 new cases for July 24-30.
 New cases were also up in Blair and Bedford counties, but dropped slightly in Somerset County when compared to the previous week.
 Allegheny County and Philadelphia’s new cases were lower this week, after driving the state’s resurgence last month. Allegheny County had 447 fewer new cases over the past seven days and Philadelphia had 307 fewer new cases.
 Hospitalizations related to COVID-19 also increased in Cambria County, up from an average of 3.6 patients a day to 8.1 patients, the dashboard shows.
 Statewide, the dashboard shows 1,252 fewer new cases in the past week than in the previous week. Hospitalizations dropped from 694 to 619 average patients a day.

“We’ll go down $1 trillion, you go up $1 trillion,” Pelosi said. The figures are approximate, but a Pelosi spokesman said the speaker is in general terms seeking a “top line” of perhaps $2.4 trillion since the House-passed HEROES Act is scored at $3.45 trillion. Republicans say their starting offer was about $1 trillion but have offered some concessions on jobless benefits and aid to states, among others, that have brought the White House offer higher.
 Mnuchin said that renewal of a $600 per-week pandemic jobless boost and huge demands by Democrats for aid to state and local governments are the key areas where they are stuck.
 “There’s a lot of areas of compromise,” he said after Friday’s meeting. “I think if we can reach an agreement on state and local and unemployment, we will reach an overall deal. And if we can’t we can’t.”
 Democrats have offered to reduce her almost $1 trillion demand for state and local governments considerably, but some of Pelosi’s proposed cost savings would accrue chiefly because she would shorten the timeframe for benefits like food stamps.
 Pelosi and Schumer continue to insist on a huge aid package to address a surge in cases and deaths, double-digit joblessness and the threat of poverty for millions of the newly unemployed.
 On Friday, they pointed to the new July jobs report to try to bolster their proposals. The report showed that the U.S. added 1.8 million jobs last month, a much lower increase than in May and June.
 “It’s clear the economy is losing steam,” Schumer said. “That means we need big, bold investments in America to help average folks.”
 Senate Republicans have been split, with roughly half of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s rank and file opposed to another rescue bill at all. Four prior coronavirus response bills totaling almost $3 trillion have won approval on bipartisan votes despite intense wrangling, but conservatives have recoiled at the prospect of another Pelosi-brokered agreement with a whopping deficit- financed cost.
 MccConnell has kept his distance from the negotiations while coordinating with Mnuchin and Meadows.
 In addition to restoring the lapsed $600-per-week bonus jobless benefit, Pelosi and Schumer have staked out a firm position to extend demanded generous child care assistance and reiterated their insistence on additional funding for food stamps and assistance to renters and homeowners facing eviction or foreclosure.
 “This virus is like a freight train coming so fast and they are responding like a convoy going as slow as the slowest ship. It just doesn’t work,” Pelosi said Friday.

The Eagles went 31-8 during Owens' three seasons on the varsity level. To see how he impacted the game, look no further than his performance in the CIF Southern Section playoffs in 2011.
 In a first-round game against Dos Pueblos, Owens intercepted two passes and caught seven from quarterback Brent VanderVeen for 117 yards and a touchdown, all the while booming six touchbacks into the end zone. He also had seven tackles and five punt returns for 40 yards. The lone blemish was him going 5-for-6 on PATs.
 The Eagles won 41-6. They would go on to win the CIF Southern Section Western Division title that year.
 “All the hard work we do on the practice field — it really pays off in the game,” Owens said after that 2011 playoff game. “Our team really came out tough tonight, everything we put in to practice showed.”
 Owens' coach during his AGHS days was Tom Goossen, who had this to say after Owens ignited the playoff win over Dos Pueblos: “What can you say about one of the greatest athletes to ever come through this school?”
 In the 42-14 thrashing of Culver City in the 2011 title game, Owens caught a 76-yard touchdown pass (finishing with four grabs for 119 yards), carried the ball three times for 13 yards, made 13 tackles, broke up a pair of passes, booted five touchbacks on seven kickoffs with five punts for 156 yards while also going 6-fot-6 on PAT tries.
 He also played soccer, track and basketball at AGHS.
 Owens signed to kick for Oregon State in 2012, joined by his high school teammates VanderVeen and Garrett Weinreich.
 Owens earned the starting job there as a freshman and held that position for about three years. Owens made 11 of his 13 field goal tries as a freshman at OSU in 2014.
 The 5-foot-9, 182-pounder played in 30 games at Oregon State overall, connecting on 32 of his 45 career field goal attempts. He had a long of 50 in Corvallis. He also hit on 77 of his point-after-tries.
 He transferred to Iowa State for the 2017 season, where he spent his final collegiate campaign. As a Cyclone, Owens was good on 17 of his 22 field goal tries with a long of 45. He also made 45 PATs that season.
 Owens tried out for some NFL teams before calling it a career in 2018.
 The remaining Player of the Decade nominees, chosen from Northern Santa Barbara and Southern San Luis Obispo counties, will be released in the coming weeks. Owens joins the previous nominees, including Arroyo Grande's Seth Jacobs and Bradley Mickey; Lompoc's Toa Taua, Ainuu Taua and Lavon Coleman; St. Joseph linebacker Fenton Will; Nipomo receiver Nick Kimball and quarterback Matt Albright; former Santa Maria quarterback Blake Truhitte and former Santa Ynez receiver Gabe Prendergast.

Often an impasse in Washington is of little consequence for the public — not so this time. It means longer and perhaps permanent expiration of a $600 per- week bonus pandemic jobless benefit that’s kept millions of people from falling into poverty. It denies more than $100 billion to help schools reopen this fall. It blocks additional funding for virus testing as cases are surging this summer. And it denies billions of dollars to state and local governments considering furloughs as their revenue craters.
 Ahead is uncertainty. Both the House and Senate have left Washington, with members sent home on instructions to be ready to return for a vote on an agreement. With no deal in sight, their absence raises the possibility of a prolonged stalemate that stretches well into August and even September.
 President Donald Trump for now appears poised to go it alone, despite the considerable limits of that approach. Following through on earlier threats, Mnuchin said Trump will move forward with executive orders on home evictions and on student loan debt, and to permit states to repurpose COVID relief funding into their unemployment insurance programs. But a potential executive order to defer collection of Social Security payroll taxes has been shelved.
 White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said, “This is not a perfect answer — we’ll be the first ones to say that — but it is all that we can do, and all the president can do within the confines of his executive power.”
 Friday’s session followed a combative meeting on Thursday evening that for the first time cast real doubt on the ability of the Trump administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill to come together on a fifth COVID-19 response bill. Pelosi summoned Mnuchin and Meadows in hopes of breathing life into the negotiations, which have been characterized by frustration and intransigence on both sides — particularly on top issues such as extending the bonus pandemic jobless benefit that expired last week.
 Pelosi declared the talks all but dead until Meadows and Mnuchin give ground.
 “I’ve told them ‘come back when you are ready to give us a higher number,’” she said.
 The breakdown in the negotiations is particularly distressing for schools, which have been counting on billions of dollars from Washington to help with the costs of reopening. But other priorities are also languishing, including a fresh round of $1,200 direct payments to most people, a cash infusion for the struggling Postal Service and money to help states hold elections in November.
 In a news conference on Friday Pelosi said she offered a major concession to Republicans.

_“Anybody that needs a test gets a test.”_
  _-Donald Trump_
 I’m a soccer coach in this area and have been since the 1970s. I was there before the beginning of the Clearfield Soccer Association and I have coached in DuBois for a time and now I am the head coach at Philipsburg-Osceola High School.
 Every coach is asking themselves about the importance of sport and school right now. At this writing the PIAA is meeting to decide the fate of our fall seasons even as Governor Wolf recommends no sports until 2021.
 A month or two ago, when I found out we were going to have a soccer season this fall, I asked my athletic director if I would be permitted to go to local health care facilities to see if I could get my whole team tested on a regular basis.
 The only way I could see myself getting on a bus for several hours with a bunch of germ factories in COVID times was if it was possible to get everyone confirmed negative.
 So I was given the go-ahead to look into it. I went to the Penn Highlands Q Care along the Rt. 322 bypass in Philipsburg and was told I could not get testing done of people who were asymptomatic.
 I went to the Geisinger facility out in Northy and they took my information and said someone would call me back on the issue. The days turned into weeks and the weeks into months and that call never came.
 To me, testing someone when you already know they’re positive is one half and testing nobody who is asymptomatic is the other half of the whole problem.
 Your president says we have so many cases because we do so much testing. The flaw in this reasoning is sort of governmental double speak. If it doesn’t exist on paper, it isn’t real. If we don’t document the problem, there is no problem. It’s freaking Dilbert. In the real world this lack of testing leads to ignorance of the problem. And ignorance in a pandemic is COVID’s best friend.
 So we want to open our schools now and have sports while we’re flying blind. As it stands right now every COVID spreading asymptomatic person is “not a case.” I’m the coach and I’ve told my school I really don’t want to be on a bus with 35 sweaty boys for several hours in any given day. And don’t get me started about those bus drivers, many of whom are older and just making extra money to get by.
 For me, I really want a fall season. I do. But I don’t think riding a bus is an option.
 Soccer is a very spread out game and I feel safe at practice with the players spread out on a sunny, breezy day. It isn’t played indoors and the field of play is huge. I think, … Maybe I hope… that soccer is safer than most other sports.
 Maybe families can travel the way we do in our travel seasons (which was also cancelled this year) where families just go in their personal vehicles to the games.
 I could certainly see soccer crowds (sic) being easy to socially distance in the various stadiums and pitches. We don’t draw like a Friday night game of American Football. And we don’t line up each school’s biggest athletes nose to nose and have them trying to bench press each other all night.
 And maybe I am deluding myself. I want so badly for my team to have it’s season. I think of my senior players who have paid their dues for years and right when they are about to hit an amazing run of performance having the rug pulled out from under them.
 I wonder if it would be possible for the PIAA to move the fall soccer season to the spring. Perhaps we’ll have advances in testing and maybe an early vaccine by then.
 Maybe by then, everybody who wants a test can actually get one.

The goal of a comprehensive plan is to help county officials define where county growth should happen, according to Saunders County Zoning Administrator George Borreson.
 Marvin and his company will work to update the plan with a budget of $41,900, taking an estimated 14 to 18 months. During this time period, MPC will conduct meetings with the Saunders County Planning Commission and the county board and hold public forums in order to accurately update the plan. They will also be updating the zoning regulations, which have not been updated since 2015, according to Borreson.
 Marvin said he is interested in seeing how different the 2004 comprehensive plan is from the new plan because of technological advances and new members of the Saunders County community.
 With Marvin’s experience working with 60 counties throughout Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and other states in the Midwest, he is confident that working with the public is the most important way to conduct the update of a comprehensive plan.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - Alabama’s Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund is running low after dropping from $700 million to about $200 million since the pandemic began.The trust fund is responsible for paying regular unemployment, which is up to $275 a week.With the drastic decrease in funds, Alabama may need to borrow from the federal government. The state has two months worth of money to pay out, assuming the state’s unemployment rate sticks at 7.5 percent, according to an Alabama Department of Labor spokesperson.“If things can improve, and we have to pay less people, that could change,” Hutchison said. “If it does become insolvent, then what we will do, like many other states around the country have already begun doing, is we will borrow money from the federal government.”Alabama borrowed money during the Great Recession more than a decade ago and repaid it. Alabama pays out about $20 million to $25 million a week in unemployment, according to Hutchison. She suspects most states will need to borrow money from the federal government by the end of the year.“It’s not anything that anybody’s excited about or anything that anybody wants to do,” Hutchison said. “However, if that’s what we need to do in order to pay the benefits, that’s what we’ll do.”Hutchison did not know how much money the state would borrow if they went forward with that decision. She said the state would have about two years to pay back without interest, unless the federal government made changes.NFIB State Director Rosemary Elebash said she is concerned about the ramifications on business owners if Alabama could not pay back the loan. If the loan were not repaid, employers would see a tax hike. Unless the federal government made changes, employers would lose their 5.4 percent discount for paying unemployment taxes, according to Elebash and Hutchison.“I am concerned about it,” Elebash said. “So this would all be on the backs of business owners. It would be coupled with a severe reduction in business activity, particularly for retailers.”Chief Economist for Economics Research Services Dr. Keivan Deravi called the fund “critically low,” but he said it is not surprising the state will need to borrow.“This is extraordinary times are we require extra ordinary steps and measures,” Deravi said. “So I do not suspect that be a problem at all.”Deravi anticipates the federal government will provide leniency to repay the loan so it would not affect employers.“A lot of these loans would be renegotiated and extended, simply because this is like no other economic time they ever had,” he said.Hutchison said ADOL is talking with the Governor’s office to see if part of the CARES Act money could be used to replenish the trust fund.The $600 million stimulus benefit from the federal government does not come out of the Alabama Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News.

New technologies are being seeded, work spaces are being remodelled, geographies are being realigned, and social narratives are being rewritten. It is still too early to appreciate its full impact, as some shifts will be transitory while others more enduring, but recorded human history spanning over five thousand years can provide a good backdrop to contextualise the crisis and its possible implications.
 Despite our misplaced sense of a stable future, the long arc of history has been anything but predictable. It is checkered with interruptions, upheavals and transitions that continue to change its course at regular intervals. Each major diversionary period is marked by environmental changes, pandemics, mass migrations, conflicts and/or power shifts. Stories, poetry, myths and mythologies of the ancient world aptly capture these epic events that were beyond the common vocabulary of their times.
 Just in the last century we experienced insurgences and revolutions, droughts and depressions, pandemics and local conflicts, the two World Wars and a cold war, holocaust and nuclear blasts, atomic standoffs and environmental fallouts. This is despite our stellar achievements with lunar journeys and quantum theories, the television set and the worldwide net, micro circuits and free markets. Ironically, the unparalleled rise of science and secularism also coincided with the unprecedented loss of blood and treasure during the same centennial.
 This century too began with sanctions, invasions and dismemberment of nations, where millions either perished, were displaced or became permanently impoverished. Populist leaders have sprung up around the world like Socratic sweetshop salesmen, offering emotive and simplistic solutions to issues ranging from lack of opportunities to fear of loosing one’s identity and blaming outsiders and established institutions for their predicaments. False narratives and deep fakes have instilled a sense of self righteousness in populations that distrust the system, demean diverse views and dehumanise anyone who looks, talks or thinks differently.
 So, given our unrelentingly turbulent past, it is tempting to view a passing viral disruption as a momentary bump upon a long and rough historic road. Yet the Covid crisis with its unique vector, velocity and vastness seems surreal. What began as a local viral outbreak soon manifested into a national epidemic and eventually a global pandemic. From a health crisis it turned into an induced economic crisis, a social dissonance crisis and a geopolitical crisis. It’s ripples have directly or indirectly touched oceans and forests, floras and faunas, spores and species, emissions and ecosystems – and all within a hundred days.
 In contrast, historically seismic events have been more like a train wreck in slow motion. An epidemic could linger or reoccur over centuries if not millennia, killing millions during the period. A conflict would sometimes unsettle a local power base which over decades goes on to change a region’s landscape. Religions, ideologies and philosophies would most times take generations to take roots before spreading its pollen beyond its immediate denomination.
 History might be contentious, controversial and complex, but it continues to ‘rhyme’; there is a method to the madness. In the first quarter of the last century there was populism, protests, and a pandemic; conflicts, a financial crisis and the reshaping of power dynamics. What followed then was the rise of fascism and a world war, the scale of which in cruelty, mortality and devastation was unrivalled in history. A hundred years later we are once again caught in the crossfire of similar forces – except our population, our proximity, along with our destructive capabilities are now many times more significant. It is no coincidence that with the increasing threats of nuclear conflicts and a looming environmental catastrophe, the hypothetical doomsday clock now stands at only a hundred seconds to midnight – the closest it has ever been to humanity’s self-annihilation.
 Every disruption presents an opportunity to reflect, shorten the learning curve and accelerate reforms. The Covid-19 pandemic could be the canary in the coal mine to remind us of not only our vulnerabilities but also our inability to work together to face our common challenges. Globalisation has been a commercial and a technological venture and not a social, cultural or an equitable experience for a vast majority of the population. Quick fix populist leaders are a mere reflection of the exasperated and polarised populations that are desperate to change a system that is not working for them.
 The eventual outcome of a low probability/high-impact Covid type event eventually depends upon the societal response to the many issues that are set into motion by the disruption. Will the virus unite or divide societies? Will it breed more blame or catalyse new cooperation between nations and cultures? Will digitisation democratise opportunities or further monopolise the powers of the tech companies? Will de-globalisation increase indigenous capabilities or the decouple global supply chains and efficiencies?
 Karen Armstrong, in her 2009 TedPrize, launched the ‘Charter for Compassion’ to address the systemic failures of our time. The charter calls ‘to treat all others as we wish to be treated ourselves’ which is ‘indispensable to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community.’ As momentary pristine skies once again give way to carbon emissions and stock markets rise in sync with the increasing Covid-19 death toll, now more than ever we need a compassionate world.
 The global challenges that we now face cannot be addressed by an industrial age nation/state construct. Social contracts need to be rewritten and new conversations started. Compassion is not just a nice idea but a global imperative that needs to be implemented practically, creatively and urgently – not just for ourselves but for our entire ecosystem. Nothing short of a transnational movement can course correct our deteriorating trajectories, before thresholds are crossed for irreversible implosions. Meanwhile the ‘atomic’ clock continues to oscillate.

Law360 (August 7, 2020, 6:11 PM EDT) -- A Michigan federal court has consolidated nine proposed consumer class actions accusing Fiat Chrysler of knowingly selling Jeep vehicles with dangerously defective engines that sucked up excessive amounts of oil, resulting in premature wear and catastrophic engine failure.

_We are on a quest to find the Player of the Decade for 2010-2019. We will be publishing profiles on 10 nominees for the honor then allow our readers to vote for the Player of the Decade. First up is Arroyo Grande's Seth Jacobs. He played quarterback, running back, tight end, safety and linebacker with the Eagles before eventually earning a starting linebacker at Oklahoma State. Is Jacobs the Player of the Decade?_
 Tom Goossen, who coached Arroyo Grande's football team to a CIF Southern Section title in 2011, once said Seth Jacobs would probably be his team's best offensive lineman if he wanted to be.
 The thing is, Jacobs looked nothing like an offensive lineman. Rather, he looked like a quarterback. And also a running back, tight end and linebacker molded into a single player.
 Still, Goossen said, “I have a feeling if we needed him at guard, he would probably make a great guard.”
 “When he plays offense for us, his speed and size make a difference,” Goossen added. “He has played every position for us from wide receiver to tight end, to running back."
 Jacob is a member of the Santa Maria Times' All-Decade Team for 2010-19 and a nominee for Player of the Decade as chosen by the sports staff at the Times. We will feature the 10 nominees and allow readers to then vote for the Player of the Decade.
 Jacobs, at 6-foot-2, 190 pounds, was on that 2011 team that won a CIF title for Goossen with a win over Culver City. He then went on to play at Oklahoma State and earn a starting linebacker job for the Cowboys. Jacobs made an impact in Stillwater, playing in 31 games over three seasons with 168 total tackles, 15 tackles for loss and four interceptions. Jacobs abruptly retired from football heading into his senior season in 2016.
 Jacobs played on varsity throughout his four years at Arroyo Grande. The Eagles had him start at quarterback as a sophomore. They then used him at running back and receiver.
 No matter where he was at on offense, though, he was always making an impact on defense. But even on that side of the ball he displayed versatility. Jacobs could rush the quarterback, play any linebacker spot and drop in coverage as a roving safety.
 Jacobs made 344 total tackles during his high school career, 251 of those solo stops. He also had six sacks and eight interceptions.
 On offense, Jacobs rushed for 16 touchdowns and also caught four touchdown passes while throwing four more. He was named the CIF Southern Section Western Division Defensive Player of the Year after the Eagles won the CIF title in 2011.
 Jacobs rushed for 530 yards on only 57 carries with 10 touchdowns that season. He also caught 20 passes for 396 yards and three more scores. On defense, he had 151 total tackles (107 solo) with nine tackles for loss, two sacks, two interceptions, eight pass breakups and two forced fumbles.
 The Eagles went 13-1 in 2011 and earned a state Top 25 ranking to end the year. They lost to Lompoc 38-28 in the season-opening game (when Jacobs made 24 tackles and Lavon Coleman carried the ball 37 times) and then won 13 straight. Lompoc and Arroyo Grande both won CIF titles that season.
 At Oklahoma State, Jacobs red-shirted before eventually starting 26 consecutive games. He was named the Cactus Bowl Defensive MVP and won the Barry Sanders Award, which is presented to the Oklahoma State player with the most contribution and the least recognition.
 Jacobs announced his retirement from the game in January of 2016.
 "My neck has been a problem for me since my sophomore year of high school," Jacobs wrote in a statement on Facebook back then. "If I get hit just right or jarred in the wrong way, I get numbness and shooting pains that go through my arms. When I was younger it didn’t happen to me nearly as much. This last season it was not uncommon for me to get a stinger (numbness and shooting pains) any day I made contact with my head. With that being said, playing football does not take precedence over the quality of life I want to live."

"I think it was a big (factor). I think it was a passing offense. It was being close to home. I'm from Texas, being five hours away. That was a blessing to be close to my grandma so she didn't have to go on a flight. She can literally drive up and spend a month or two with me if she wanted to. Being in the Superdome, obviously I hope that we'll be able to get fans in there. Because last year playing with the Niners, playing in the Dome it was sweet playing on that turf and the crowd going crazy. I want that whole experience. I do not know if I'll be able to get it, but that's why I came. And I came here because I want to win and this is a winning organization and I also want to win another Super Bowl and I feel like this is the place that can make it happen."

U.S. Rep, Stephen Lynch and challenger Dr. Robbie Goldstein faced off in a debate this week and tackled issues including racial justice, healthcare and gun control. The pair will appear on the Democratic primary ballot to represent the 8th District of Massachusetts in Congress this September.
 The 8th District includes Quincy, Braintree, Weymouth, Milton, Cohasset, parts of Boston and several other nearby communities. Lynch, the incumbent, has held the House of Representatives seat since 2001. Goldstein, a political newcomer, is an infectious disease doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital.
 "It's been a huge honor for me to represent this district over the last 20 years," Lynch said.
 The debate was co-sponsored by the Walpole Media Corporation and the Westwood, Walpole and Dedham League of Women Voters, which put together the questions. It was moderated by Debbie Winnick.

 Winnick asked the candidates if they thought the current policing legislation before Congress is enough to tackle some of the nation's largest policing problems. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020 is currently before the Republican-controlled Senate.
 Lynch, who had a hand in drafting the legislation, said he does, particularly praising a ban on choke-holds. Goldstein called the act a "monumental step forward," but the bare minimum.
 "It's certainly not enough," he said. "We need to move forward to end qualified immunity at the federal level and certainly in every state. There are a number of bills that are coming out of this House, many of which the congressman has not yet sponsored or co-sponsored, that would really address some of these issues."
 Both candidates said the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2011, was not sufficient to protect the public in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Goldstein said it put the country on the right track, but that he wants to see it expanded.
 "Having worked in the broken system, having been in the ICU facing all of those patients living through and suffering with COVID, I know that it's not enough," he said. "We need to move forward and address access, cost and equity in our healthcare system. The only way we can do that is move toward a single- payer healthcare system."
 Lynch said the Affordable Care Act is in much better shape than it was back in 2010, noting that he supported the House version of the bill but not the Senate version. He said the three main problems with the system have to do with its affect on union healthcare plans, an anti-trust exemption for insurance companies and removing public option.
 "I've been working to put back the public action and restore the Affordable Care Act to what it was originally intended to be," he said. "My opponent is looking to rip out the ACA root and branch, and go to a completely different model. We ought to save and improve the affordable care act, not get rid of it."
 Lynch and Goldstein both said further federal economic assistance for coronavirus impacts should be prioritized.The CARES Act, which passed in March, provided $2.2 trillion in economic relief. The HEROES Act, which has not yet been passed, would provide another $3 trillion.
 Goldstein said the acts are necessary but not "everything that we needed." Lynch agreed that the CARES Act was not enough, but said everything a coronavirus bill should be is in the HEROES Act.
 "It has a lot in there. It deals with unemployment issues, it deals with aide to the cities and states, it also deals with personal payment for unemployment benefits and stimulus," Lynch said.
 Other topics included gun control, climate change resiliency, housing development and mass transit.
 Goldstein and Lynch will face off in the Democratic primary election next month. There are no Republican challengers on the general election ballot in November, which means -- barring a massive write-in campaign -- the winner of the primary will be the winner of the seat.

When my son was in third grade, his class took a field trip to the Spanish Military Hospital Museum in St. Augustine, Florida. This was a military facility that operated in the late 18th century. It operated at a time when St. Augustine changed hands from Spain to England and then back to Spain. The museum provides tours that recreate bygone hospital practices. Actors put on a full surgical demonstration of early procedures from that era. There is also an apothecary demonstration discussing the medicines that were available for treatment at the time, and there is a tour of the medicinal herb gardens.As we arrived, the kids quickly packed into the tiny building and eagerly sat on the floor. The first presentation was given by an actor playing a Spanish physician who asked for a volunteer from the audience to be his first patient. This surgeon then gave a vividly horrific description of how he would treat this patient's battle wounds. He described how he would carry out an amputation of an extremity in painstaking detail using a prehistoric collection of surgical artifacts. The kids learned where the term bite the bullet came from. The doctor also discussed procedures such as tooth extraction and bloodletting. They described how they cared for people with cholera, influenza, and yellow fever. As we heard about these treatments, we were riveted. We giggled as we shuddered.During the tour, it was explained that the Spanish doctors were highly educated when compared to the English, who depended on the town barber for surgery because he was the only one with sharp tools. Spanish medicine also was novel at the time because it involved infection control measures and preventive medicine. Their hospitals had better outcomes because they kept sick patients quarantined.Even though the tour pointed out that these medical practices were gruesome, they were the best that their society had at the time. They were even above the local standard of care.In reminiscing about this primitive medicine, I began to wonder if, in the distant future, people may look back at our medical practices in dealing with COVID-19 in this type of disturbing context. The novel coronavirus has presented us with so many unknowns. Early on, it was incorrectly compared to influenza. Scientists then argued the main route of transmission for months. There were many heated debates on what type of personal protective equipment was adequate. Then, there was a controversy regarding if pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic people are contagious. There were also disputes regarding if children could transmit the virus.Furthermore, although COVID-19 was originally thought to be a respiratory virus, it is now known to invade our endothelial cells and have severe cardiovascular complications. Treatment approaches have also been incredibly controversial. Just as the 18th-century physicians and apothecaries experimented with numerous herbal compounds to fight unique diseases in their time, modern scientists have been throwing the pharmaceutical kitchen sink at COVID-19 of late.I cannot help but compare our current scientific challenges to those of the remote past. COVID-19 was an entirely novel virus that had never existed before, and it presented countless new challenging unknowns. Thankfully, great strides have been made in research, treatment, and vaccine development in the past six months. Nevertheless, I think that in a couple of hundred years, people will look back at this point in history and contemplate our choices.Sarah C. Smith, DO, is a family physician.

Still, if Laird wanted to play college football, it looked like the Ivy League was the best option for the all-purpose back.
 But he wanted more.
 So, he elected to walk on at Cal, a Power Five school in the Pac-12. Once there, Laird rose to college football stardom.
 For his work at the high school, college and NFL level, Laird is a finalist for the Times' Player of the Decade. The Times compiled a list of nominees after polling area coaches for the top players from the 2010 through 2019 seasons. Laird was the lone player from a San Luis Obispo or Santa Barbara county high school to score an NFL touchdown during the past decade.
 He actually made the roster and played in five games as a freshman at Cal. He red-shirted there in 2015 and returned to the team in 2016, playing in 12 games and carrying the ball eight times.
 Then came 2017, when Laird broke out, going from walk-on to premiere back. He had 191 carries for 1,127 yards and eight rushing touchdowns that season. He rushed for 214 yards against Oregon State alone. He also caught 44 passes for 322 yards and a score.
 Laird continued to produce in his senior season at Cal in 2018, racking up 816 yards on 197 carries with five touchdowns. He also caught 51 passes for 288 yards and four more touchdowns.
 That gave Laird 2,008 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns in his Cal career.
 During his days at Cal, Laird gained recognition for his touchdown celebration that mimicked opening up a book, an act inspired by him starting a summer reading program called Walk on Then Run. The challenge registered about 3,000 students in the summer of 2018.
 Laird was then selected to play in the 2019 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, but didn't suit up for the game due to injury. He was a finalist for the Burlsworth Trophy, given to the top player who started his collegiate career as a walk- on.
 Laird was also a semifinalist for the Campbell Trophy, which honors the college football player with the best combination of academics, community service and on-field performance.
 Still, Laird would be overlooked once again. Though he had NFL size at 6-feet, 210 pounds and produced against top college competition, Laird was not selected by an NFL team in the 2019 Draft.
 He eventually signed a free agent deal with the Miami Dolphins and, just like he did at Cal, made the roster. Last season in Miami, Laird played in 15 games and scored one touchdown.
 “I’m not as smart as everyone thinks,” Laird told the Miami Herald last season. “I study. I try to work hard. I’m still working on working harder.”
 The remaining Player of the Decade finalists, chosen from Northern Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, will be released over the next week.
 Laird joins the previous nominees: Righetti grad Caleb Thomas; Arroyo Grande's Garrett Owens, Seth Jacobs and Bradley Mickey; Lompoc's Toa Taua, Ainuu Taua and Lavon Coleman; St. Joseph linebacker Fenton Will; Nipomo receiver Nick Kimball and quarterback Matt Albright; former Santa Maria quarterback Blake Truhitte and former Santa Ynez receiver Gabe Prendergast.
 Once all nominees have been announced, readers will have the opportunity to vote for Player of the Decade. The list of nominees was compiled by the sports staff at the Santa Maria Times, Lompoc Record and Santa Ynez Valley News, which polled area coaches.

Time has erased some of the memories of African-American owned businesses that operated in Elizabeth City in the early 20th century.
 But that is about to change thanks to Elizabeth City State University history professor Dr. Melissa Stuckey and the students who will be in her class this fall titled “African-Americans in North Carolina.”
 Stuckey gave a brief glimpse of the history of African-American-owned business in the city, and the plans for her class this fall, during a virtual History for Lunch program sponsored by the Museum of the Albemarle on Wednesday. More than 100 people tuned in for the program and Stuckey fielded almost a dozen questions after her presentation.
 Stuckey scratched the surface of her research into the history of African- American owned businesses of the period when she published a column in The Daily Advance in June detailing the history of Albemarle Bank. The Albemarle Bank was the first African-American owned bank in the city and was in businesses from 1920-25.
 Stuckey was researching old Elizabeth City city directories when she noticed that an asterisk on a city directory from 1923 noted the Albemarle Bank was an African-American-owned business.
 Before telephone books, city directories were a main source of information on local businesses. Stuckey said city directories were in use for around eight decades in the city.
 “These directories would list everybody in the city just like the good old yellow pages,” Stuckey said. “They lasted well into the telephone era and the last city directory in the city that I have been able to access is from the 1960s.”
 Stuckey noted that during the time of Jim Crow laws in the South, African- American businesses were identified to indicate their race.
 “How profound it is in our society that there was a time where something as generic as a city directory, that people would be identified and marked as different because of their race,” Stuckey said. “That star indicates that your different, that you are black. It says you are a lesser citizen, frankly. It is a sad artifact of our history, but it is also an important one to think about.”
 Moving forward, Stuckey’s students will continue researching city directories as well as looking at census records, old newspaper stories and maps to write papers about the African-American businesses and people they learn about.
 “For them, it will be a brand-new experience,” Stuckey said of her students. “We will be diving deeper into that (city) directory from A to Z, finding other businesses and other people. We are going to have a lot of work to do. We want to have good outcomes every semester that I teach it.”
 One research tool that ECSU students will uses is a Sanborn Map.
 From 1867 to 1977, the Sanborn Map Company of Pelham, New York, produced large-scale — usually 50 feet to the inch — color maps of commercial and industrial districts in 12,000 towns and cities in the country. The maps were used to assist insurance companies in setting rates and terms and each set identifies each structure in those districts, including its use, dimensions, height and what material was used to construct the building.
 Sanborn map-makers would go door to door gathering information on every structure in the city, Stuckey said.
 “They are beautiful, they are in color, and they are very easy to use,” Stuckey said of the company’s maps.
 A 1923 Sanborn Map of downtown Elizabeth City shows a church, the Church of God and Saints of Christ Tabernacle, and a poolroom that are listed as “colored.” The two structures appear to be located where Ehringhaus Street is today near South Martin Luther King Drive and South McMorrine streets.
 Stuckey wonders if the “poolroom” is, or later became, the popular Blue Duck Inn and Grill.
 In 1940, Henry C. Hargraves, a prominent African-American businessman at the time, owned the Blue Duck at 404 Ehringhaus Street. An ad appears in “The Negro Motorists Green Book” promoting the establishment that year.
 The Blue Duck was a popular gathering place for Elizabeth City’s African- American community. The ad promoted its hot meals, beer, wine and ale as well as its nightly dancing.
 “The Green Book was a travel guide for African-Americans during the era of segregation when cars had taken over from trains and other forms of travel,” Stuckey explained. “During segregation moving around the South could be challenging if (African Americans) were not familiar with the lay of the land in terms of what places were welcoming (of them).”
 Looking at a 1923 Sanborn Map, Stuckey said the Blue Duck’s 1940 location is in the vicinity of the “poolroom.” But the names and the configurations of the streets in the area changed over the years, making it hard now to pinpoint exact locations.
 “Maybe the Blue Duck Inn is that poolroom, maybe not,” Stuckey said.
 But with dozens of ECSU students about to examine the era more closely, those questions, and many others, will probably be answered.
 “It is a story that I hope we can thoughtfully unpack,” Stuckey said.

Football is the lifeblood of high school athletics, but Fridays under the lights remain in question after the N.C. High School Athletic Association announced Thursday it was delaying the fall sports season past Sept. 1.
   
 Losing an entire football season would be a significant financial loss for local schools. The StarNews obtained 2019 football ticket receipts from football-playing schools inside New Hanover, Brunswick and Pender counties, and the 10 schools combined for $310,123.55 in revenue.
   
 According to West Brunswick athletic director Jimmy Fletcher, most of the Trojans' football income goes toward paying game officials across the entire school year. If football season can't be played, but winter and spring sports play on, schools would need to get creative.
   
 "We are very fortunate and thankful that our district helps us with a lot of athletic costs, but they don't provide enough for all officials throughout the year," Fletcher said. "Our booster club does a great job raising money, but they're already working on redoing our weight room. It would make it really, really tough if we don't play football."
   
 West Brunswick's football gate revenue last year totaled $34,382, which topped the three high schools in Brunswick County.
   
 New Hanover's football ticket revenue of $54,238 was the benchmark across the area
   
 Laney made $38,486 off gate receipts in 2019. Like Fletcher, athletic director Fred Lynch is thankful that the New Hanover district helps its athletic programs. There's also some added help from alumnus Michael Jordan, which Lynch would be able to fall back on.
   
 However, paying officials would remain a concern, and Lynch is already starting to gameplan cost-saving measures if there is no football.
   
 "I've started telling my staff, be ready to travel less this coming season," Lynch said. "Trips to Wake County and Durham probably won't happen, and if there's no football, it definitely won't happen. That would take a huge chunk out of our mileage budget."
   
 What could be the solution? The two most likely options, according to local coaches and athletic directors, is either a shortened fall season with no state playoffs, or moving the season to the spring.
   
 Fletcher and Lynch stand on opposite sides of that discussion. Flethcer wants as many home football games as possible, and if that means moving the season to the spring, so be it. Lynch would prefer to have a shortened season in the fall, so the school can have its football revenue before winter and spring sports get started.
   
 But none of that mentions student-athletes. NCHSAA commissioner Que Tucker has continuously said she feels a responsibility to provide some sort of season for fall athletes, and that will be the main objective for athletic directors, too.
   
 "At the end of the day, the kids have to be at the forefront of our minds," Hoggard athletic director Brad Lewis told the StarNews in May. "Spring athletes have already missed a season. What can we do to get them, and all athletes, back on the field in a safe manner?"

In his latest campaign, Arpaio got only a fraction of the campaign money he was famous for raising and was criticized for his conviction. Arpaio said many people didn’t know he was running until they saw his name on the ballot.
 His platform consisted of his unwavering support for Trump and bringing back practices that the courts have either deemed illegal or his successor has ended, such as immigration crackdowns.
 He also was facing a far more moderate electorate than in earlier campaigns.
 In the profiling case, both Arpaio and Sheridan were found in civil contempt of court for disobeying a 2011 court order to stop the sheriff’s immigration patrols, leading to Arpaio’s criminal contempt conviction in 2017. Sheridan wasn’t charged with criminal contempt.
 Arpaio and Sheridan vigorously dispute the contempt findings. Sheridan, a 38-year veteran of the sheriff’s office who retired after Arpaio was defeated in 2016, said he was unaware of the highly publicized court order and didn’t run the unit that carried out the immigration patrols.
 Sheridan said he could help turn around the tarnished law enforcement agency and insisted that he is his own man.

CAMDEN — Camden officials have given the initial green light to the county’s plan to borrow $3.6 million to build a new library.
 At its regular meeting earlier this week, the Camden Board of Commissioners adopted a “pending resolution” for financing the library project. They’re scheduled to vote at their Sept. 8 meeting to give the resolution final approval.
 The county leases space for the current library. However, the property owner has advised officials the lease will not be renewed.
 Rather than seek other leased space, county officials have proposed building a new library. It’s envisioned as part of a larger complex on a county-owned site that would also include a community center and administrative offices. Camden owns land across N.C. Highway 343 from the Camden County Historic Courthouse that it plans to use for the complex.
 The county has been working with Boomerang Design to develop a plan for a one- story, 11,700-square-foot building that would include a library, community meeting room, commissioner and committee boardroom, and small kitchen.
 The county plans for any equipment and furnishings in the current library that are usable, including current shelving, to be moved into the new facility to help keep costs down.
 County officials have cited the urgency of building a new library and the economic uncertainty stemming from the coronavirus public health crisis as reasons for prioritizing the library building ahead of the rest of the project.
 County and school officials also plan to put a $33 million bond referendum on the general election ballot in November, asking voters to authorize the borrowing needed to construct a new high school.
 The pending resolution adopted Monday supports an installment financing agreement not to exceed $3.6 million to build and equip the library building.
 The resolution states the county has an urgent need to proceed with the project and does not have time to seek general obligation bond financing through a bond referendum.
 The resolution says “the necessity of such project dictates that the project be financed by a method that assures the project will be constructed in an expedient manner.”
 The resolution also indicates commissioners have determined the cost of installment financing is reasonably comparable to other available methods of financing.
 Any increase in taxes necessary repay the money borrowed will not be excessive, according to the resolution.
 No one spoke at the public hearing Monday on the resolution.
