After facing backlash from players, parents, fans and others, Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren attempted to elaborate Wednesday on the decision to postpone football season until spring.
 The first-year commissioner has been criticized for a lack of transparency in laying out why, less than a week after the conference released a revised schedule, it was necessary to pull the plug.
 “We thoroughly understand and deeply value what sports mean to our student- athletes, their families, our coaches and our fans,” Warren wrote in what was called an “Open Letter to the Big Ten Community.”

Over the last 72 hours, there have been some 10,849 lightning strikes throughout California, state officials said.
 As of Wednesday afternoon, 367 major fires were burning statewide, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom.
 “This fire season has been very active and, not surprisingly, that activity has taken shape in a number of counties up and down the state,” he said during a news briefing.
 At this time last year, crews had responded to a total of 4,007 fires throughout the state, Newsom said. They’ve already been dispatched to 6,754 this year.
 More than 300,000 acres have burned statewide in 2020, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. By comparison, California wildfires charred about 270,000 acres in 2019, the smallest number since 2011.
 The rapid outbreak of new blazes has stretched the state’s firefighting resources to their limit.
 Jeremy Rahn, the lead Cal Fire public information officer for the LNU Lightning Complex fire, said Wednesday that the state had already requested 375 additional fire engines as well as additional hand crews from out-of-state agencies, and hired “nearly all available private firefighting ‘call when needed’ aircraft in the western United States.”
 “The size and complexity at which these incidents are burning is challenging all aspects of emergency response,” he said during a media briefing Wednesday. “Firefighting resources are depleted as new fires continue to ignite.”
 Newsom, however, expressed confidence that California is prepared to rise to the challenge and thanked the leaders of other states — including Arizona, Nevada and Texas — for their pledges to send additional resources.
 California is “putting everything we have on these fires,” he said, and “we’re now getting the support of some of our partners in the Western United States, and for that, again, we’re very grateful.”
 The LNU Lightning Complex fire, which has burned more than 46,000 acres, is composed of at least three major zones in Napa, Sonoma, Solano, Yolo and Lake counties.
 The most serious fire in the complex appears to be the Hennessey fire, which began Monday morning on the eastern edge of Lake Hennessey in Napa County and marched into Solano and Yolo counties Wednesday morning, forcing residents to flee overnight and burning homes and other structures.
 As of Wednesday evening, 50 structures had been destroyed, 50 more had been damaged and 1,900 were threatened, fire officials said.
 Officials have ordered the evacuation of the western edge of Vacaville — a city of 100,000 residents about halfway between San Francisco and Sacramento. The Vacaville Fire District also ordered evacuations of Pleasants Valley Road, which lies west of the city, and the English Hills and Gibson Canyon Road areas north of the city. A KPIX-TV reporter tweeted a video of a home burning off Pleasants Valley Road.
 The fire was also forcing the evacuations of some northern neighborhoods in the city of Fairfield west of Interstate 80. By Wednesday afternoon, the fire jumped Interstate 80, forcing it to shut down in both directions between Manuel Campos Parkway in Fairfield to Lagoon Valley Road in Vacaville, the California Highway Patrol said.
 Evacuation orders and warnings were also issued for a stretch of Highway 121 in the Vaca Mountains northeast of the city of Napa, and in the mountains about eight miles northeast of St. Helena.
 A second grouping of fires in the LNU Lightning Complex is north of Lake Berryessa, burning in northern Napa and southern Lake counties. It’s made up of the Gamble, Morgan, Spanish and Green fires. Officials Wednesday afternoon ordered evacuations for Lake County residents living around Hidden Valley Lake and Jerusalem Valley.
 The third group of fires is in Sonoma County and has triggered evacuation warnings on both sides of the Russian River. The Walbridge fire was burning north of Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve and the community of Guerneville on the Russian River. South of the Russian River, evacuation warnings were issued as a result of the Meyers fire.
 Vegetation throughout the area is extremely dry and considered to be in severe drought, according to Cal Fire.
 Officials said the Wallbridge and Meyers fires were likely to push southeast Wednesday as they burned through timber and the coastal forests’ understory.
 The complex’s northern fires — the Gamble, Green, Morgan and Spanish — were burning through brush and oak woodland and heading south toward Mount Vaca.
 The Hennessey and Markley fires southwest of Lake Berryessa were moving toward Yountville and Oakville, pushed by winds going downslope over ridgetops.

The erosion of public trust in the Postal Service may also present a barrier to the implementation of necessary and meaningful operational changes. I don’t know, for instance, if the number of sorting machines removed from post offices was appropriately scaled to the decline in mail volume. I think the organization’s decision to suspend further changes until after the election is a good one, in light of public concern. (Although it appears that most of the sorting-machine removals had already been completed before the announcement, making the announcement less than reassuring.) In the long run, less paper mail is a good thing for the economy and the environment, and if the Postal Service is not allowed to adjust its operations and assets to reflect the new reality of the services it is providing (less mail, more packages), then the financial losses at the service may be greater than are actually needed to serve its social mission. For that reason, it is especially important that the next president make postal appointments who demonstrate that they see the organization as neither a business nor a political entity but a service aimed at fulfilling a specific mission at the best possible cost.

Cory and Trish Lee moved their business from downtown Rice Lake to the Cedar Mall, reopening Lee's Lavish Boutique in the former Tradehome Shoes site. Cory said the best way to describe their merchandise is "comfortable fashion" for ages and sizes 3T to 3X. That includes wear for both casual and dress.
 The Lees said the downtown site was a good place for their first year in business, but they now hope to expand through the new location. They also have a store in Menomonie. "We came to the mall for growth; we need to reach out more," said Cory, who replaced the floor and walls of their new location for a new look.
 The business also reaches out through Facebook with live sales on Wednesdays when new inventory is revealed with an option to buy online. They also offer "bingo for butterfly bucks," a fun way to earn discounts.

They are not even real users the users are bought,  and that you shouldn't take on face value. When I stand up against a cause, there are people who oppose me and their ideologies don't match mine. We live in a polarized society where we need an excuse for trolling and to abuse. What I know is that awareness is essential, and that is what motivates me to not react. Also, I am aware of what goes behind the scenes. I know where it is coming it. I know everything. It has nothing to do with me. I represent a danger to them and that's why they are doing it.

There are reasons to worry that the Postal Service’s losses may get worse. Businesses that have cut back their mail-marketing budgets or shifted to online marketing may not return to sending so much junk mail when the pandemic has waned. And the surge in parcel revenue that has offset the recent drop in the paper-mail revenue — shipping and package revenues rose even faster than package volumes, bringing in $8.3 billion in this spring compared to $5.4 billion last spring — may not persist. In recent years, companies like Amazon have launched their own delivery arms to help reduce their reliance on the USPS and on private delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. The surge in online orders during the pandemic forced many online retailers to rely on the Postal Service’s delivery capacity. But, in the long run, retailers like Amazon may decide to expand their own internal delivery infrastructures instead, taking market share away from the post office again.

Le problematica evidenziate per gli aspetti prettamente interni sono; l’età media del personale che equivale a 56 anni; la carenza sempre più accentuata delle unità presenti, basta pensare che complessivamente nella Sezione di Campobasso ci sono solo 31 unità operative ( di cui 4 assegnati solo temporaneamente) + il dirigente ed un funzionario mentre a Termoli 13 unità + il responsabile e che, già dal nuovo anno, 6 unità andranno in pensione per raggiunti limiti di età; la difficoltà oggettiva di garantire in concorso con Termoli almeno una pattuglia nell’arco delle 24h, cosa che spesso determina la chiusura di qualche ufficio interno o addirittura l’impiego anche del funzionario proprio per carenza di uomini; la possibilità di veder impiegato un poliziotto della specialità anziché per strada presso il corpo di guardia della Questura, cosa voluta da altri sindacati e così come già accade a Termoli; la possibilità di impiego del personale di Termoli in autostrada.   Per quanto invece attiene alla questione che interessa più da vicino il cittadino, Robusto ha evidenziato al Ministero che sul territorio della Provincia, già gravemente penalizzata per una logora, obsoleta, nonché inefficiente rete ferroviaria, le strade principali d’interesse, quale unica possibilità di spostamento dell’utenza e delle merci sono: la “SS647 fondo valle del Biferno”; la SS17 che attraversando il Molise collega Foggia a L’Aquila, la SS645 che collega Campobasso a Foggia; la “SS87 Sannitica” che collega Benevento a Termoli e la “SS16 Adriatica” che percorre la costa. Tenuto però conto dei pochi uomini e risorse, spesso l’unica tratta a vedere attivo il servizio è la “Bifernina” che da Bojano collega il capoluogo a Termoli. Orbene, a tutti gli abitanti della Provincia è noto cosa accade nel momento in cui si giunge all’altezza del ponte del liscione soprattutto in questo periodo estivo. Tre semafori ed interminabili attese che come una frontiera dividono il territorio in due. Immaginiamo quanto tempo impiegherebbe una pattuglia della stradale che procedendo indistintamente in una delle due direzioni, dopo aver superato il primo semaforo debba tornare indietro per recare soccorso. Di più, un paio di anni fa proprio difronte al problema carenza di personale fu proposto, dai sindacati, di eliminare il turno di notte, in quella circostanza la FSP POLIZIA si oppose è ottenne di mantenere quel turno di servizio, ma oggi dinanzi alla reiterata richiesta non è affatto possibile opporsi. Immaginiamo quindi lo scenario in cui il territorio dell’intera Provincia sia completamente sguarnito da pattuglie della Polizia (unica a vigilare sulle statali) oltre a ridurre la possibilità di soccorso pubblico, qualora se ne ravvisasse la necessità, l’assenza di Polizia Stradale nelle ore notturne equivarrebbe a dare il lasciapassare a chiunque decida di delinquere nottetempo e/o spostarsi da una regione limitrofa ad un'altra per traffici illeciti. Quanto sopra esposto non è solamente il malcontento del personale della Specialità, piuttosto il quadro di una situazione che diventerà sempre più grave e che da distante, alle Autorità competenti, appare sfocato e di poco rilievo.   Non di meno la FSP POLIZIA fa propria la reiterata doglianza dei tanti cittadini, stanchi delle concrete precarietà della rete viaria, manifestano preoccupazione per l’incontrollata pericolosità di quanti, avendo oramai capito che sulle strade i reale controlli sono sempre più scarsi nonostante gli sforzi della Specialità, disconoscendo la segnaletica e i limiti si rendono autori di incidenti gravi e spesso luttuosi che negli ultimi mesi hanno fatto versare fin troppe lacrime.

Should those fires continues their march south, they may eventually reach the burn scars of the 2017 Atlas fire, one of several that tore through California’s wine country that year.
 Burn scars from recent fires can make a significant difference in how a fire behaves. Earlier this month, crews in Southern California caught a break when the western flank of the Lake fire — which is burning near Lake Hughes — hit an old 2013 burn scar and slowed to a crawl.
 The fires have sent American Red Cross staff and county workers from across the Northern California region scrambling to prepare for evacuees, said Denise Everhart, the Red Cross’ Pacific Division disaster executive.
 The Red Cross has set up between 10 and 15 temporary evacuation points where residents’ needs are assessed before they’re sent to a hotel or motel. Everhart said that while more than 100 families were placed in rooms Tuesday night — some driving up to an hour away for lodging — it’s not a sustainable model if the evacuations continue to expand.
 The LNU Lightning Complex fire may trigger up to 35,000 more evacuations, Everhart said, explaining that historically, between 1 percent and 3 percent of evacuees go to shelters.
 She sought to assuage any concerns that going to a shelter could put people at risk of the coronavirus.
 “We’ve put precautions in place,” she said. “If you’re told to go, go. We’re all working together to keep people safe. ... The fire is the risk.”
 Though emergency officials have opened multiple evacuation centers in Vacaville, many of those forced to leave their homes in the middle of the night were setting up camp in parking lots instead of entering buildings.
 Those with RVs had generators up and running and their front awnings open. Others sat in folding chairs by their cars or in their front seats. Still more had already checked into local hotels, where rooms were filling fast.
 Shawnee Whaley and her 79-year-old mother, Sharon Whitaker, sat inside an evacuation center Wednesday afternoon wrapped in American Red Cross blankets.
 Whaley said they had no warning that the fire might be a threat when they went to sleep Tuesday night. But when Whaley was woken up by a phone call from a friend and saw that the power was out, she flung open her front door and “saw the glow of the fire.” She used a ladder to climb onto her roof and spotted flames approaching.
 Barefoot and still wearing pajamas, she ran across the street to her mother’s trailer to wake her. Whaley grabbed a mask and her glasses but forgot her wallet. She left the front door open so her cat, Jitterbug, could hopefully escape.
 Lloyd Broughton, 78, evacuated after a firetruck came up his road at 3 a.m. He, his wife Anne, 73, and daughter Kristine, 35, gathered their seven rescue cats and packed two cars.
 All three suffer from breathing problems and, with a heavy layer of ash falling, they were already coughing and having trouble, Kristine said.
 While evacuating during a fire is always a stressful experience, it’s been made all the more so because of the coronavirus outbreak — which has raised new fears among displaced residents who would normally pack into closely quartered emergency shelters and created new challenges for the agencies that operate them.
 “No one is ready for it,” Lloyd Broughton said of having to leave in the middle of a pandemic.
 Another rapidly growing fire was burning in the mountains southwest of Silicon Valley, on the border of San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties. The CZU August Lightning Complex — which consists of 22 fires — has burned at least 10,000 acres and forced the evacuation of more than 22,000 people, officials said Wednesday.
 Evacuations were ordered around Big Basin Redwoods State Park, Ano Nuevo State Park, Butano State Park and Pescadero Creek Park. Other evacuations included the area around Bonny Doon. Evacuations centers were set up at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds in Watsonville and at Pescadero High School.
 At least 20 structures, likely single-family homes, have been destroyed, officials said during a Wednesday evening press conference. In San Mateo County, the CZU August Lightning Complex fire is threatening the communities of Pescadero and La Honda. In Santa Cruz County, structures have been lost in the Swanton Road area, and a Cal Fire station is being threatened by flames.
 Firefighters expressed worry about the fire reaching the communities of Boulder Creek, Ben Lomond and Felton, located northwest of Santa Cruz, said Mark Brunton of Cal Fire. The weather conditions for the next three days are grim, Brunton said.
 “That makes that threat very direct and very real,” he said. “We’re doing everything we possibly can to protect life and property.”
 On Tuesday, Newsom declared a statewide emergency in order to help California respond to the outbreak of fires.
 Newsom’s office said the state had secured assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to respond to fires in Napa, Nevada and Monterey counties.
 “We are deploying every resource available to keep communities safe as California battles fires across the state during these extreme conditions,” Newsom said. “California and its federal and local partners are working in lockstep to meet the challenge and remain vigilant in the face of continued dangerous weather conditions.”

There were rumblings some schools, notably Nebraska and Ohio State, might go rogue and create their own schedules for the fall — building up hopes for football-hungry fans.
 In his letter Wednesday, Warren listed primary factors that led to the Big Ten's decision:
 • Transmission rates continue to rise at an alarming rate with little indication from medical experts that campuses, communities and the country could gain control of the spread before the start of competition.
 “As our teams were ramping up for more intense practices, many of our medical staffs did not think the interventions we had planned would be adequate to decrease the potential spread even with very regular testing,” he wrote. “As the general student body comes back to campus, spread to student-athletes could reintroduce infection into our athletics community.”
 • There is too much unknown about the virus, recovery and longer-term effects. In particular, Warren mentioned the risk of cardiomyopathy, a condition that makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood and can lead to heart failure.
 • Concerns about the ability in contact sports to adequately mitigate infection risk through social distancing, face coverings and proper hygiene. Warren said the start of full-contact practices and games would make contact tracing more difficult and that there could be frequent and significant disruptions if a season were conducted.
 “We understand the disappointment and questions surrounding the timing of our decision to postpone fall sports, especially in light of releasing a football schedule only six days prior to that decision,” Warren wrote.
 He said the plan when the new schedule was released was to operate as if a season would be played while simultaneously monitoring the spread of the virus, testing and medical concerns as full-contact practice drew closer.
 “Accurate and widely available rapid testing may help mitigate those concerns, but access to accurate tests is currently limited,” he wrote.
 Warren noted the decision to postpone the season would have massive financial implications on the schools, with some schools saying they stand to lose more than $100 million in projected revenue.
 “We understand the passion of the many student-athletes and their families who were disappointed by the decision," Warren wrote, “but also know there are many who have a great deal of concern and anxiety regarding the pandemic.”

 Black, Latino and Native American people are nearly three times as likely to be infected with Covid-19 than their White counterparts. Those three groups are about five times as likely to be hospitalized. And people of color across the board are more likely to die of the virus.

After more than 40 years of service, Mike Sheehy is retiring from Cummings Properties. His career-long employment at the commercial property firm charts a path of continued achievement.
 "There are great opportunities here," said Sheehy, when asked about his decision to spend his entire career at Cummings. "If you apply yourself, you can keep climbing the ladder as high as you want to go."
 Sheehy joined Cummings Properties as a carpenter's helper shortly after graduating from Northeast Regional Vocational School. He soon worked his way to a team leader position. As he amassed greater trade and leadership skills, he was promoted to associate division manager in Woburn, then co-division manager at the massive Cummings Center campus in Beverly.
 For the last 19 years, Sheehy has served as a division manager at the Company's Woburn headquarters, where he has overseen all construction and maintenance activity for nearly 3 million square feet of commercial space. This role also involved managing and helping to develop hundreds of team members who have worked in a variety of trades.
 "At Cummings, we hire the person, rather than the resume," said Vice President of Field Operations Greg Ahearn. "Mike's approachable nature, quiet confidence, and selfless dedication to being a team player have made him a very effective leader at multiple levels. His easygoing style and willingness to share his impressive trades knowledge are just a couple of qualities that have made him an exceptional colleague."
 Sheehy played significant roles in several of the firm's major developments, according to Ahearn. His contributions to Cummings Center's transformation from the defunct former site of United Shoe Machinery Company are memorialized through the campus' pondside Sheehy Park.
 "Working for Cummings has been a great situation for me," said Sheehy. "It's a stable organization, and there is always a new project in the works, which makes for a diverse and varied work experience."
 Sheehy is one of five employees to reach the four-decade mark at the 50-year- old firm, which is known for its uncommon employee longevity. A lifelong Massachusetts resident, he was raised in Winchester and has lived in Reading with his wife, Lisa, for more than 30 years.
 "We encourage all of our employees to really consider what it is they want to be doing and engage in regular conversations with a supervisor about what needs to happen to get them there," said chairman and CEO Dennis Clarke, a Winchester resident who joined the firm in 1992. "Mike's journey at Cummings Properties is an excellent example of what can happen when you focus on where you want your career to go and put in the work to realize your goals."

It’s kind of embarrassing, but the long days of isolation have forced me to turn to television. I haven’t even plugged my television into an outlet for five or 10 years, maybe longer.
 Friends have often asked if I was watching one TV series or another and when I’d respond that I was television free - there was always a long pause and a pointed stare. No TV? They looked at me like I was a neanderthal, sloped forehead and all.
 The creepy germ COVID-19 has put an end to my television bias. With the library closed I had nowhere to turn, nowhere to hide. It was the painful end of my steady supply of books and my voracious reading.
 Really, what was my choice? The black box sat quietly in the corner without being called on to entertain. I have always had lovely conversations with my dog Ivy Claire and she’s a pretty good conversationalist, but as the lock-down went on and on, she seemed rather bored with my blathering. I quickly ran out of things to say. I lost my sense of humor early on and resorted to staring out the window. She curled up and went to sleep, not wanting to yammer on with me. It was almost too much attention for her.
 So, when youngest son, Kyle came to visit (one of my two visitors for the duration) he jiggled around and re-installed the Roku wireless thingie and the TV shook off its dust and came back to life.
 After such a long absence I was glad to see the offerings on the screen. I was always kind of ticked off when the choice of free television became barely a choice. People put up big dishes (remember those behemoth dishes filling up the backyard?) There are only a few left now.
 But, still remaining, are the skeletons of big antennas on the roofs of homes. My neighbors had one and somehow they could crank it around from the inside of their living room searching for a connection. From inside our house, we could hear that squeaking as they turned it looking for the mother ship and it always made us laugh.
 Then the world of cable and tiny connectors that could pick up various stations and of course the hometown venue of the Green Bay Packers was finally brought inside where friends lined up on the couch and ate special snacks like Packer football-shaped cheese loaves and Packer cupcakes until it turned the snacker’s tongues green. It was a new era.
 Now televisions hang on the wall as big as drive-in-movie screens. They cover the wall and have crystal clear audio surround sound and behemoth, albeit rather pixelated images.
 There are movie nights. Documentaries. Cooking shows and everything from learn to play guitar to how to build your own log cabin. Some stations drone on with political talking heads and can be missed without regard.
 I have recently been able to get some books from the library with an appointment and a half-hour window - but certainly a welcome respite. As far as my new television connection, I have to say I am hooked on the medical show “Grey’s Anatomy.” It is perhaps a bit more realistic than I’d like (gory and bloody) but, I have actually learned a lot about how some diseases are treated. It isn’t just one minor surgery after another. It is heavily filled with the oddest inflictions, like the morbidly obese gentleman who was delivered to the hospital in the back of a truck, or the guy with a knife stuck in his head to the logger who sucked in a tiny tree seed which somehow grew in his lung. There were car accidents, fires, and train wreck victims. Interns were always being sent out to look for severed legs or arms to possibly salvage (once bringing back a left leg for a patient who’d already lost the left).
 So, I have made friends with my television again. I don’t know how long my new interest will last, but at least it is something to entertain my tiny mind.
 I hope everyone has found some outlet to enjoy - probably something more productive than TV - but if there is one thing this terrible virus has given us all - it is time.
