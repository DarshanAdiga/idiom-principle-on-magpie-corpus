‚ÄúWe changed it to Tuesday and Thursday to get a day of rest from the hunting pressure, to let the ducks settle and make the overall hunting a little bit better,‚Äù Waldrup said.


  That change was prompted both by biologists‚Äô observations as well as suggestions from hunters, Waldrup said.


  The Raft Creek hunting area now includes the Magellan Tract in its online draw for hunts on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays.


  That acreage is in a more remote area of Raft Creek Bottoms WMA and was available for hunting without a permit, as it was not a designated hole like the impoundments at Raft Creek.


  Because of the difficulty in accessing the area, hunters who land a permit to hunt the Magellan Tract may use all-terrain and utility-terrain vehicles to reach the spot.


  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite a walk to access it,‚Äù Waldrup said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs connected to the WMA but it‚Äôs not like the rest of the WMA. You can‚Äôt put in at a launch area and get to it.‚Äù


  Luke Naylor, AGFC‚Äôs waterfowl program coordinator, said, ‚ÄúThe Magellan Tract is a new spot we were able to acquire a few years ago and we‚Äôve gotten it up to a point where we can open it up to a draw hunt now.‚Äù


  Waldrup and the AGFC‚Äôs wetlands habitat coordinator Jason ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Jackson said AGFC staff have done extensive habitat manipulation to both Raft Creek and Cypress Bayou to enhance duck hunting.


  ‚ÄúBetween soil amendments, seed application, irrigation, soil manipulation and other habitat work, we‚Äôve done more than $180,000 of work on these two areas this year,‚Äù Jackson said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping the ducks and the hunters can reap the benefits of this extra effort to put the right food on the ground at the right time.‚Äù


  As for Cypress Bayou, Naylor said the plan all along was to eventually require permits to hunt Red Cut Slough.


  "It was getting a lot of use since it opened and that was predictable,‚Äù Naylor said, noting the WMA‚Äôs proximity to the Little Rock metropolitan area. ‚ÄúWe made it clear it was going to be a limited-access waterfowl area at some point. It takes a couple of seasons to figure out how a place operates, and we‚Äôre going to go ahead now and implement that draw.‚Äù


  The six hunting units in Red Cut Slough at Cypress Bayou will be available for self-check-in, and unlimited numbers of hunters on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he noted.


  Permits can be picked up and returned at the parking lot access to Red Cut Slough.


  Other WMAs that require weekend permits by online draw are Sheffield Nelson Dagmar WMA Conway George Tract (three units drawn weekly) and the Freddie Black Choctaw Island WMA West Unit (youth hunters, but all members of the hunting party can hunt, Dec. 14, 21, 28, Jan. 4, 11, 18, 25, seven units available).


  For all online applications, each hunt period must be applied for separately. There is a $5 fee for each application.


  Duck season begins in Arkansas on Nov. 21.

The refreshed Tesla Model 3 is full of updates that we've previously looked at, but confirmation from soon-to-be owners in Europe show the automaker's battery partner, Panasonic, packed a surprise to usher in longer driving ranges. The latest Model 3 sedans come with an 82 kilowatt-hour battery pack full of more energy-dense cells, which explains the healthy increases in the car's driving range.


  Electrek first reported on the information, which comes from owners on Reddit, and they show early registration information needed in Europe to take delivery of a new Tesla. Included is a photo that shows an 82-kilowatt-hour battery pack is part of the party. One of the big changes to the latest Model 3 is an increase in driving range across the board; the Standard Range car goes 13 miles further, the Performance model goes another 16, and the Long Range does 30 more miles now.

Nothing is settled. I am going to front-load my conclusion because although Trump will leave office, the country remains almost equally divided at a level far deeper than party affiliations, but rather by the lens though which Americans interpret events and express their vision for their collective future. It is not only Red versus Blue state, but within each state there is a significant rural/urban divide. One need only look at the county maps of Georgia and Pennsylvania to appreciate that the Democratic vote in the cities overwhelmed the more numerous Republican rural counties. Even New York State, our neighbor to the south is dominated by Republican voters north of the Kingston line, before you get into commuting distance of New York City. These deep divisions present different challenges for the incoming Biden Administration and the Republican Party, facing a struggle between Trumpism and renewal.


  Biden‚Äôs victory is ironic since it is a mirror image of Trump‚Äôs win in 2016 ‚Äì both achieved 306 Electoral College votes, but the lawsuits will either confirm or alter the final figure. Trump won 4 states by 80,000 votes in 2016, and Biden is winning four states by about the same total margin. Biden cannot claim to have a national mandate, not with the Republicans gaining seats in the House of Representatives, no state legislature flipped Democratic, and the US Senate is likely to remain Republican pending two run-off elections in Georgia in January 2021. Biden will have to abandon the more radical elements of his agenda imposed on him by the leftist elements of his party and govern from the center. Biden is one of the most experienced politicians to enter the Oval Office in the last 60 years and has a close personal relationship with Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader in the Senate. They will have to make deals to get anything passed. Even if the Senate goes to a tie and Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a vote to break it, there are conservative elements within the Democratic Senate caucus who will not vote for radical change. Angus King, the Independent senator from Maine, is not going to vote for massive tax hikes and punitive regulation coming out of the House. The Republicans may even get him to come caucus with them if the Democrats move too far to the left.


  Biden is a decent person who wants to do the best he can for the country, and he will end up governing from the center with a House that is only slightly Democratic and a Senate this is not his, no matter which party controls it. There was another highly-experienced president who governed the same way ‚Äì George Herbert Walker Bush ‚Äì and he did a good job. He managed the decline of the Soviet Bloc with not a shot being fired and free of upheaval. He surrounded himself with people who were professional, not ideological in key administration positions. Bush Sr. was the best one-term president of the last 100 years. Biden could do a lot worse than to emulate his approach to governing, given the thin mandate the people handed him.

It has to do with the chemical difference between water and the things that have smells. So it turns out that these small molecules that trigger our sense of smell are, by and large, not friendly to water and vice versa. So you know how when you make an oil and vinegar dressing, you have to work hard to integrate the oil in the water because they naturally separate? Smell molecules are, generally speaking, much more like oil than like water. So if there's water around, they tend to go in the other direction. And what's happening with what the scientists call "wet up" in nature or on a pavement or actually even in our mouths when we have something dry ‚Äî when we eat something dry, including chocolate ‚Äî is that the moisture actually drives the volatile molecules, the smell molecules, out of the dry material that it's coming into contact with. So we get this burst of aroma that simply wasn't evident before.

On June 18, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration‚Äôs effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, more commonly known as DACA.


  More than 600,000 young people across the nation, including more than 13,000 in Wisconsin, breathed a brief sigh of relief.


  Relief, because they are not immediately eligible for deportation, they can keep their work permits and drivers licenses, and they don‚Äôt have to abandon their careers and hopes for the future. At least not just yet.


  Brief, for two reasons. First, the ruling was deliberately narrow. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, refused to comment on the legality of the program itself, only on the manner in which the administration had attempted to end it.


  ‚ÄúThe wisdom‚Äù of creating or ending DACA protection, he wrote, ‚Äúis none of our concern. We address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action.‚Äù


  They determined it had not. This means that the administration is free to come back again, offering more justification for its actions, and the court could allow the program to be terminated. The administration has signaled its intent to refile paperwork immediately. The second reason is that DACA never was anyone‚Äôs idea of a good solution to the predicament faced by so-called ‚ÄúDreamers.‚Äù


  Everyone agrees that solutions to the many problems in our immigration system should come from the legislature, not the executive branch. President Obama created DACA as a last resort when lawmakers proved incapable of passing the DREAM Act, which, if passed, would make it possible for Dreamers to legalize their status permanently and pursue citizenship.


  Participation in the DACA program is expensive, humiliating, and dangerous. Legal firewalls exist to protect the data participants are forced to provide the government, but few families with undocumented members really trust this administration not to access the information and someday hunt them down.


  DACA participants generally do not regard their parents as criminals who do not belong here. (In fact, neither overstaying a visa nor crossing the border without a visa is a crime.) Most of these young people look at their parents as heroes who risked everything to give them a better life, who work themselves to the bone in underpaid, underprotected jobs to provide a future for family both here in the United States and in their countries of origin.


  As we give thanks for this reprieve for thousands of our neighbors, let us also connect our collective willingness to tolerate cruelty to immigrants with our willingness to tolerate cruelty to other groups.


  Mass incarceration, refusal to confront police brutality, segregation into separate and unequal neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces‚Äîthese are all different facets of the same problem. They are all the same failure to recognize and value the full humanity of other people.


  We should find the courage to confront our fear of the ‚Äúother‚Äù to truly become the land of the free and the brave.

BLAINE, Wash. (KIRO) - The first ‚Äúmurder hornet‚Äù nest that was found and destroyed in the U.S. had the ability to produce 200 queens, scientists say.‚ÄúIt really seems like we got there just in the nick of time,‚Äù said Sven-Erik Spichiger, an entomologist with the Washington Department of Agriculture.Researchers cut the Asian Giant Hornet‚Äôs nest out of tree and took the section back to cold storage. There, they pumped it full of carbon dioxide, which made it too cold for hornets to fly, as they opened the nest up.They used chopsticks to pick through and found 76 queens alive inside.‚ÄúEverything we found (was) alive inside the nest, which would make sense had it likely emerged between the time we did the eradication and the time we did our examination,‚Äù Spichiger said.The nest had the ability to produce about 200 queens. About 108 of them were still in their cells in the nest. The other 76, plus three found when they took down the tree, were put on ice to study.If they had not found and eradicated the nest when they did, they‚Äôd be looking at the possibility of 200 more nests.Researchers think there are at least three nests in the county, and they will keep trying to find them.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way for us to ever be certain whether or not we got them all,‚Äù Spichiger said.However, as it gets colder, it‚Äôs harder for the hornets to fly around.‚ÄúShould there be an active beehive attack, our chances are good of finding more. As people start going out hunting, they may stumble into one and let us know about it,‚Äù Spichiger said.The hornets were first detected in the U.S. in December. It‚Äôs unknown how they got to the U.S. from Asia.Scientists are worried about what they could do to the honeybee population. A few murder hornets can kill tens of thousand of honeybees in a hive in a few hours.Copyright 2020 KIRO via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

Baylor looked like a potential Final Four team a year ago before the pandemic canceled the season, and it could be in the mix again now that Butler is back after withdrawing from the NBA draft. The Bears were No. 2 in the AP preseason poll, highest in school history.


  "Jared has shown tremendous growth in his first two seasons at Baylor, both on and off the court," Baylor coach Scott Drew said. "He has always been a great teammate with an infectious personality and now that he's an upperclassman, he's taken on more of a leadership role."


  The dynamic Dosunmu also took a look at the NBA before deciding to return, a huge boost for the No. 8 Illini.


  The 6-5 guard was the first Illinois player in 20 years to lead the team in scoring as a freshman and sophomore. Dosunmu can do a little of everything on the court, averaging 16.6 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.3 assists while shooting 48% from the floor last season.


  Cunningham arrived in Stillwater with plenty of hype as the highest-rated recruit in school history. The athletic 6-8 guard can play the point or fill it up when he wants to, putting him at the top of numerous NBA draft boards for 2021.


  Cunningham dominated as a high schooler in Florida and is expected to have a similar impact in the Big 12 and beyond.


  Gonzaga was the AP preseason No. 1 for the first time and Kispert's decision to return was a big part of it.


  The 6-7 senior is a superb 3-point shooter (44% last season) and a good slasher to the basket. He averaged 13.9 points and 4.0 rebounds on a deep team last season and will be a key cog on a team with Final Four aspirations.


  Martin started his career at Arizona State has the bouncy-haired energizer off the bench, lifting his team with pizazz and hard-nosed defense. The 6-foot guard has since developed into an unquestioned leader on a team loaded with talented guards.


  Martin averaged 19.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.1 assists last season and his decision to bypass the NBA to stay for his senior season has expectations running high for the 18th-ranked Sun Devils.


  He is Arizona State's second preseason AP All-American, with Ike Diogu in 2003-04.

  Casting a wider net, Goldrich‚Äôs six-member team ‚Äî trained in physics, biology, chemistry and medicine ‚Äî worked with community affairs and faculty at Northwestern, University of Chicago, MIT, Boston University and New York University to identify area high school students who could most benefit from the program.


  How it works


  Students can sign up for daily tutoring sessions in chemistry, biology or algebra through the STEMPod website. By reviewing resources from advanced placement and state regents‚Äô programs, the team can ‚Äúeasily follow the schools‚Äô curricula and provide exactly the right amount of information,‚Äù said Goldrich. ‚ÄúAs it turns out, the STEM curriculum in the United States is standardized enough to keep teachers and students on the same page within and between school districts.‚Äù


  Tutors use the conference platform Zoom Premium, and work through problems using Microsoft Surface or an iPad. Students are encouraged to demonstrate mastery by leading discussions and guiding tutors when solving problems.

Having attended all of the meetings the former trustee of the English Montreal School Board presided over, there is no question in my mind that Marlene Jennings did a good job at reining in a school board that was characterised as being dysfunctional. No doubt she will serve well as the new president of the Quebec Community Groups Network (QCGN), which also had its fair share of problems.
 However, I completely disagree with her views on the elected school board system. She was against Liberal school board reform Bill 86 (2015) and presently " fully supports the court challenge to Bill 40 which she says is a clear violation of the English communities‚Äô right to control and manage education."
 Let's recall, both majority governments realized that the elected school board system with commissioners was not the way to go. Both governments said that decision-making power should be transferred from school boards, which have outlived their usefulness , to schools.
 At any rate, the Quebec English School Boards Association (QESBA) put on a fear mongering campaign and solicited Marlene Jennings to produce a report: "English School Boards Election Systems Study Panel Report." It called for the status quo.

When the schools can reopen again, we‚Äôre going to be back out there reading. We do a lot of things with the Boys & Girls Club. I think it‚Äôs important. The education of our student- athletes kind of works in three phases. We obviously have the athletics. We want them to get a great education, and that‚Äôs priority No. 1. But the third pillar to this is to make sure we‚Äôre holistically educating our student- athletes. And part of that is volunteering in town, realizing how fortunate we are.


  ‚Äú... We want to make sure that we‚Äôre being good citizens in Kenosha and giving back whenever we can, too, because we want the community to come out and support our student-athletes. We want them to come out and watch them play. We want them to be in the stands. We want them cheering really, really loud. Obviously, we rely heavily on the financial support of our community, of our alumni, of our donors, of the businesses in town.

All these responses are justifiable. More than that, they can all be correct. Time and again in the Trump era, we‚Äôve had to cover stories‚Äîthe Bible photo op, Sharpiegate, and so on‚Äîthat are at once funny, and eye-rollingly pathetic, and extremely harmful; now such stories are coming thick and fast, as satirically amateurish lawsuits vie for our attention with abuses of federal power. On Saturday, Rudy Giuliani, Trump‚Äôs lawyer, spread conspiracies about fraud at a press conference outside the Four Seasons in Philadelphia‚Äînot the hotel, but a landscaping business adjacent to an adult bookstore and a crematorium. Hilarious? Yes. Really actually not funny? Also yes. The traditional press, which tends to privilege clarity of narrative and flatness of tone, has never really been equipped to handle such jarring contradictions. Yesterday, a reporter asked Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, whether his department was coordinating with Joe Biden‚Äôs team, and Pompeo replied that ‚Äúthere will be a smooth transition‚Ä¶ to a second Trump administration.‚Äù There followed a debate among journalists as to whether or not Pompeo was joking. But much of that debate glided right past the salient point: a key tenet of Trumpism and its informational architecture has been to blur the line between joking and not joking until there is no longer a meaningful distinction.
