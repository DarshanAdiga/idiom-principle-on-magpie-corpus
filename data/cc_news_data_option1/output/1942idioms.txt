During a news conference at an air force base in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where the Snowbirds are based, team commander Mike French said the cross- country tour known as Operation Inspiration had been suspended while the team's Tutor jets were subject to an "operational pause".
 Lt Col French would not speculate on the cause of the crash, but insisted safety was the Snowbirds' "No. 1 priority".
 He added each aircraft was torn down and rebuilt about every two years and subject to regular maintenance and checks prior to every flight.
 The crash was actually the second for the Snowbirds since October and the second involving a Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft in as many months after a Cyclone helicopter went down in the Ionian Sea on April 29, killing all six people on board.
 The Snowbird jet crashed into a residential neighborhood in Kamloops. Nobody on the ground was injured.

While it took three-fifths of each the state House and Senate to put the amendment question on the ballot, only a majority vote in each house would be needed to remove it.
 “As to the likelihood of a vote being taken or a decision being made like that, I can't speak to it,” Pritzker said during his Monday COVID-19 briefing. “I can only say … that the GOP wants to keep people from voting on this, keep people away from the ballot box, says something about their lack of confidence in their position.”
 Pritzker has already invested millions of his estimated $3.4-billion personal fortune to promote the ballot measure, which was one of his cornerstone campaign promises.

"Once a week, my assistant coach, (former Morrison standout) Sammy Biggs, will text me," he said. "He sent me a text reading, `It would've been the Three Rivers Conference meet this week,' or `Sectionals are this week.' He put up a picture of last year's sectional winning team and sent that over to me."
 As it turns out, Biggs will be stepping into Duncan's role next spring after spending the last four years as his assistant. A five-time state medalist as a Mustang, Biggs capped his high school career with state titles in the 100 and 400 and took second in the 200 to lead Morrison to a third-place team finish in 2006.
 "After I graduated and went on to Southern Illinois, where I ran and played football, I got to compete for some great coaches and got to see a different side of coaching, and that sparked my interest for sure," said Biggs. "Before that, honestly, this never really was a goal of mine. I talked to (Morrison athletic director Gregg Dolan) and told him how interested I was in helping out.

Dear editor,   this reflection of mine comes from the important considerations of Ferruccio de Bortoli on human capital and the ruling class in our country, published yesterday on the Corriere della Sera.   A premise I is mandatory: for more than 25 years, are a political leader, but my true profession, the work that I lovethe one with which I think I managed to achieve something that is important, not only for me and for my family but for the Country is to entrepreneur. I have always believed, from the liberal, who are entrepreneurs real — ones-are capable, with their forces, to create, innovate, transform — to exercise a public function important, in the interest of the community. In some way, my next commitment in policy — born in a condition of necessity for the situation of the Country and I'm proud of — I have always understood as the continuation of that social function, as the direct taking of a responsibility towards the country which has given me and to which I believe I have given something.
 I know, of course, that from that moment on, I chose to represent a partand that this, in good and in evil, leads us to give a political reading of what I say. However, in this circumstance, I have felt called in their case as an entrepreneur, as part of that middle class of production, that the "ruling class private" spoken of by de Bortoli, who can not merely ask for public aid — that also are necessary at this time to keep the production system — nor can it be limited to acts of philanthropy individualto which as well I myself are subtracted.
 For this, the entrepreneur — and without that this has no political significance or part — I propose to my fellow entrepreneurs, but even the great managers, to sit down around a table and think concretely about how to respond to the appeal of de Bortoli. How to come to the aid of the training of the future ruling class of this country, that today we charge the absence, in all fields, in politics but also in every other aspect of public life, from the economy to justice, by the trade union at the university, from the public management research. Are all areas in which our country is now producing, and also export individual talent, but is lacking of a collective fabric of qualified personnel. How to fix this? First of all, with a large investment in higher education, that traditionally in Italy is weak and that in times of crisis is further penalized.   Our social responsibility of entrepreneurs is to look to the future of our country.That future in which they will live and operate businesses that we have created. We have to do. We can give life, with our forces, a great deal of private initiative for higher education, which integrates and full to the top of the public system of education. That the selections and make it grow the best, allowing an opportunity, irrespective of income, and by the starting conditions.
 Could be a first step of a wider. A more large a project for the future of the country as entrepreneurs, we can give an important contribution of ideas and experience, in addition to economic means. I know many fellow entrepreneurs or managers of large companies who share this sensibility. It's the time to step forward, out of the woods, to think and act together. Without any political connotation, in a civil service for the uk.

Reps are not commenting, the studio remains silent. Reporters who are often in-the-know are taking to social media with cryptic teases; the kind which are just enough to later claim, "I tried to tell you it was coming but couldn't," but simultaneously offer the ability to say, "I never claimed to know anything!" However, the feeling of the Snyder Cut being closer than ever continues to grow. Perhaps the silence is an indicator that the movie will be finished and delivered? Perhaps when the credits roll on Man of Steel during Snyder's watch party of Wednesday, he will have one last bit of information for his loyal fans?
 If the studio does want to give this a theatrical release before sending it to HBO Max (and it can be finished in time), there is the option of sending it to theaters when the reopen to simultaneously test the waters on whether or not people are going to be willing to gather in them when they are declared safe, again. The studios is already re-releasing _The Dark Knight_ trilogy overseas.
 If WB does... Release the Snyder Cut... fans who have claimed to be disinterested all along will likely be tuning in, if only out of curiosity with a quick social media claim of having nothing else to watch. However, the landscape beyond it becomes more interesting. What if it is actually very good? Certainly, it's too late to create any more stories spawning from it, especially with actors like Ben Affleck, right? And what does this mean for future films where fans claim studios interfere with a director's cut? Does it set a precedent for other fans to feel as though if they rally hard enough, they will get their wish of an alternate version of a movie?

A half-trillion-euro European fund laid out by France and Germany sparked optimism Monday about fighting economic fallout from the coronavirus, as did encouraging early results on vaccine research by a US biotech firm.
 Global markets surged as Europe pushed towards normality with major landmarks reopening after a two-month hiatus, and as China told the World Health Organization it would back an independent inquiry into the handling of the outbreak once the pandemic is "brought under control."
 At the White House, President Donald Trump slammed China's handling of the crisis -- and dropped a bombshell by revealing he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that is an unproven treatment against coronavirus.
 Trump, who has tested negative for COVID-19, dismissed safety warnings about the drug, saying he is taking it "because I think it's good. I've heard a lot of good stories."
 Nearly 4.8 million people have tested positive and 317,565 have been killed by the disease since it emerged in Wuhan, China late last year, according to an AFP tally.
 Chinese President Xi Jinping, battling allegations from Washington and elsewhere that his country concealed the scale of the problem, told the World Health Assembly -- the WHO's decision-making body -- that Beijing had been "transparent" throughout the crisis.
 Beijing also offered to share a vaccine once one became available.
 But China's main critic, the United States, sharpened the tone at the same talks, accusing the WHO of being too close to Beijing, citing as evidence the continued exclusion of Taiwan from the UN health agency.
 \- Vaccine hope -
 In the United States, the hardest hit nation, deaths surpassed 90,000 -- but all 50 states have begun easing lockdown measures to varying degrees.
 In Michigan, car assembly lines cranked up for the first time in two months, with employees wearing masks and enduring temperature checks and social distancing protocols.
 And as death and hospitalization rates continue to drop in Europe -- Italy's daily death toll fell below 100 for the first time since early March -- Europe sought to pick up the pace on its exit from the lockdown.
 St Peter's Basilica and the Acropolis in Athens opened their doors to visitors alongside many European shops, restaurants and churches and in Venice, the gondolas returned to the waters, even if the gondoliers wore gloves and masks.
 "It's good news, a sign of everyone's desire to get back to normal as soon as possible, but without ever lowering our guard in order to defeat the virus once and for all," said Giovanni Giusto, city councillor for the Protection of Traditions.
 Global markets were buoyed meanwhile by the 500-billion-euro ($540 billion) European fund, along with encouraging early results from clinical trials of a potential vaccine by Moderna.
 The first stage trial provoked an immune response similar to people convalescing from the COVID-19 disease in eight recipients, according to the company which has a larger phase 2 trial due to begin soon.
 \- But fears for Latin America, Africa -
 But despite the hopeful signs, recent days have also seen soaring infections in Brazil, India and South Africa, and United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned the virus' impact on the southern hemisphere could be "even more devastating" than in the north.
 India extended its lockdown covering 1.3 billion people to the end of May as its reported infections jumped.
 In Latin America, Brazil now has the fourth-highest caseload worldwide at 245,000 confirmed infections and deaths have risen sharply.
 Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has blamed lockdowns for unnecessarily hurting Brazil's economy. He has defied social distancing measures, even as experts and regional leaders warn the country's healthcare infrastructure could collapse.
 Ecuador reported the first COVID-19 case in one of its indigenous Amazon tribes, deepening the crisis in one of South America's hardest-hit countries.
 Nicaraguan hospital staff have said the nation's health system is overwhelmed with patients suffering from respiratory illnesses.
 Relatives have reported that the bodies of loved ones were being carted off in pick-up trucks for "express burials" without their consent.
 "Mourners are forced to chase trucks with the coffin to find out where their loved ones are being buried," the opposition National Coalition said in a statement denouncing government secrecy.
 There was also grim data in Africa, where the number of infections rose rapidly.
 South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, taking the total to 15,515 -- the highest on the continent.
 And South Sudan's first vice president, the former rebel leader Riek Machar, has tested positive for COVID-19, his office said Monday.
 \- Loans, not grants -
 The coronavirus has left the world economy facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression. Fresh evidence of the deep damage came when Japan announced its first recession since 2015.
 The world's biggest economy is also headed to a massive downturn, US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell warned.
 April-to-June data "will be very, very bad," Powell said, adding that the economic hardship "could stretch through the end of next year."
 In a gesture of European solidarity, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed "borrowing from the market in the name of the EU" to fund 500 billion euros of spending on the 27-strong bloc's "worst-hit sectors and regions".
 Countries receiving financing would not have to repay the sum, said Macron.
 Northern countries including Germany had until now firmly rejected joint debt in the name of budget discipline -- and the plan quickly met resistance from some quarters.
 But the relaunch plan was welcomed elsewhere as a sliver of light, with European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde dubbing it "ambitious, targeted and welcome."

THE future of the Oasis Bar & Cafe Biloela remains murky after the shop’s owner made the move to reopen the doors just before restrictions eased over the weekend.
 Cafe owner Mark Di Ruggiero said he made the move to reopen on May 12 with the hope his business could recover as more foot traffic was allowed in cafes across Queensland.
 “I couldn’t stay shut too much longer, the amount of time I shut was starting to really hurt me,” Mr Di Ruggiero said.
 “I’m hoping to recover and now the restrictions have been lifted and we are allowed 20 people that’s getting back to half normal.
 “You don't make too much on the coffees and I have to stay open and get back in the public eye because I've worked too long and hard to build up a name and then just shut.
 “I’m still living in hope, the trading is good but over the six-week period the bills come in and the suppliers need to be paid money.”
 After what Mr Di Ruggiero described as a “close to normal trade” since Saturday when restrictions eased, the viability of the cafe is dependant on securing loans from the bank and the government.
 “If I don’t get anything that could make me struggle and I could end up shutting still,” Mr Di Ruggiero said.
 “At the moment we are trading good and I just need for this stuff to come through and get answers on it all.
 “The JobKeeper is coming through but that in itself is a catch 22.
 “Your doors are shut for six weeks and when you claim it they backpay it to March 30 and every staff member you nominated you had to pay them $750 a week regardless of if they worked those hours.
 “Being a small business and you’re trying to keep it going as it is, paying other staff members $750 is hard, yes you get it reimbursed but you have to have that capital in the first place so I only nominated my two baristas.”
 Mr Di Ruggiero said his application for a Small and Medium Enterprises Guarantee Scheme loan which he lodged on April 7 was being processed.
 Based on a businesses turnover, the loan can be for up to three years and has an initial six month repayment holiday.
 The cafe owner said the temporary closure was heavily influenced by the shop’s inability to adjust to a takeaway model at the start of the lockdown with high costs and competition key factors.
 “It wasn't viable for me to reopen because they made everybody turn to takeaway or close down and we weren’t set up for it and it would take too much to transfer to takeaway,” Mr Di Ruggiero said.
 “You’ve gone from Biloela having two takeaway outlets to everybody doing it.
 “That’s all well and good to say we can do this takeaway but when you’re hitting 10 per cent unemployment not everybody can eat out that much.
 “The staff wages, electricity and ongoing costs would've far outweighed just shutting down so I would’ve been in a much worse predicament than I am in now that I’m trying to get out of.”

Rothstein said in an interview toYnetnews. co. Il Because the response of the bar-a good sign according to ליצמן whereby "We acted wisely." She "Bullshit."And that the atmosphere at the health department. "Hot". However, after last night claimed ליצמן that the government has demonstrated "panic overdose" in the face of epidemic הקורונה, and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, "responded to the fears" of the CEO of the Ministry of Health.
 Rothstein added: "I'm in a job with ליצמן a decade or more, I know the animations the other in the office, I really wondered (about the attack of ליצמן – a"P). If you notice the reactions that come from the Ministry of health all the time under senior officials in the Ministry of Health see that the atmosphere there Hot". According to him, "allowed to make mistakes", but what I've been missing it. "A dialogue with groups of experts". However, he said that he "didn't want to hurt that"to bar a good sign." Because …"He did his best as one who is not a doctor".
 Bar a good sign. himself, responded to the attack anomaly of ליצמן, who appointed him to the position 5 years ago, saying that he "respects very much the minister ליצמן and his views and his contribution very much for war with the virus, and I believe all along we acted wisely and saved the lives of many thousands and let me settle with this." Rothstein referred to this, citing other countries dealing with the virus in a way beneficial than Israel. "Look at Egypt, better than us, Cyprus, better than us, Crete better than US, Greece as a whole. They also have yes the bar is a good place (bar a good sign)? He's also closure them closure terrible? No matter what they did and when did. The problem in the UK say, they pinned on Johnson is that he acted too late - I'm not sure that's true.

Coming from the Ministry of Health and said no need to do tests, tests don't help none. Why we forgot it? Even today, I warn that we open the schools need to sample the teachers".

Louisville mother Gretchen Bell works on Bloom Elementary online school work with her sons Finnegan Bell, 8, and Teagan Bell, 6. Gretchen maintains a routine each day with the assigned work and her own online supplements and artwork. "The week before school shutdown I was already looking into homeschooling programs.

Or you can't play with that kid at the park? We can't go see your friends. I think it's the most important thing to stay engaged and positive for them. Mom culture, you feel that solidarity online, but the kids don't have that." April 9, 2020
