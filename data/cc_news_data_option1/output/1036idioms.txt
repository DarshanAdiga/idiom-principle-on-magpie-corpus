Wainwright, always a great lyricist, uses "Peaceful Afternoon" to sing about long-term commitment. As he mentions at the beginning of the song, he's been with his husband for 13 years. Over the course of the track, Wainwright sings about all the petty little annoyances that can tear couples apart and the magic that will hopefully keep them together. He brings it all to a pretty devastating conclusion on the chorus: "I pray that your face is the last that I see on a peaceful afternoon." If you've been with someone for a long time, that's the kind of line that can hit home pretty hard.

Vancouver's Spectres have been around for nearly a decade, and they've helped spur an underground resurgence of dark, gothy old-school post-punk. They've been a DIY band this whole time, but they've got a remarkably strong sense of melody. Their sound takes plenty from Joy Division, just like every dark post- punk revivalist takes plenty from Joy Division, but you can also hear plenty of the Cure and Echo & The Bunnymen in there. Today, the band follows 2016's _Utopia_ with the new album _Nostalgia_ , their fourth. It's worth your time.
