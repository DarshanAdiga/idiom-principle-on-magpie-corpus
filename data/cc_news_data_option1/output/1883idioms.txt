The first task is untangling the web of “announced” partnerships among the leading players. The relationship map — who’s in bed with whom — is messy. In an attempt to make sense of it all, Juliussen dropped the AV chaos into three separate bins: robo-taxi, OEM and high-tech software platforms.

Aurora, a startup launched in January 2017, is developing a full AV stack called Aurora Driver. Hyundai is one of Aurora’s early investors. Aurora previously said a plan to expand its R&D program with Hyundai to develop a self-driving platform.

“It’s impossible to say yet how widespread this will be or how substantial the impact will be – we’ll start to learn that over the next year. Each lender’s assessment process is different, it’s a dark art that’s hidden from the public and never published, so this is likely to be yet another factor applicants will need to navigate.
 “Certainly many new challenger financial firms talk about their new, more sophisticated customer assessment models, that they believe are better than just relying on credit files. It’s that very fact that sparked me to look at this in the first place. And as they will be able to see that someone has temporarily not paid their mortgage, they can spot payment holidays.
 “My hope is that as these holidays are specifically for the short-term financial hit of coronavirus – and as the practice is so widespread – it won’t be used by many firms, and where it is it won’t tarnish individuals’ credit reputation for too long. But there’s no real way to know.”
 Mr Lewis said the findings should not stop anyone who needs a mortgage payment holiday from getting one.
 He said: “If it’s crucial for cash flow, just do it. Yet for those on the border, who may find it temporarily useful but can cope without it, add this to the fact that interest racks up during the payment holiday and I’d err on the side of caution.”
