A Trai official explained that even in the current scheme of things, '0' is prefixed for calls made from fixed lines to mobiles in another service area, and that the regulator has recommended the same practice be followed within a service area too for creating additional numbering space.


  Moreover, this route can be opted after exhausting other alternate methods that it has prescribed.


  It has also recommended that a revised and new National Numbering Plan (NNP) should be issued at the earliest, and has made suggestions on ways to free up unutilised capacities, to create space for mobiles services.


  Another TRAI official clarified that the regulator is of the firm view that there is enough scope in the current system of ten digits, and that 11 digits scheme is in the realm of distant future when the present mechanism won't be able to cope with the market requirements.


  During the course of the consultation, most of the operators opposed 11-digit numbering for mobile numbers, arguing that a 11-digit numbering scheme would incur massive configuration modifications including software and hardware, involve additional cost for the players, and cause confusion and inconvenience to the customers.


  "The authority is of the opinion that some serious problems are anticipated with change in the mobile number from 10 digits to 11 digits. This would require widespread modifications in the configuration of switches involving cost," it said.


  This would also cause inconvenience to the customers in the form of dialling extra digit and updating phone memory and could lead to more dialling errors, infructuous traffic, and loss of revenue to the operator, TRAI explained in its recommendations.


  Hence, the authority is of the view that migration from 10 digits to 11 digits may be resorted to, "only if all the efforts to continue with the 10-digit numbering are exhausted", it said.


  The regulator has suggested that all the SIM-based Machine-to-Machine connections using 10-digit mobile numbering series should be shifted to the 13-digit numbering series allocated by Telecom Department for M2M communication at the earliest.


  It has also recommended that a revised and new National Numbering Plan (NNP) should be issued at the earliest.


  The Telecom Department had asked TRAI to furnish its recommendations on the strategies of National Digital Communications Policy which also talks of "ensuring adequate numbering resources, by developing unified numbering plan for fixed line and mobile services."


  Accordingly, the telecom sector watchdog had issued a consultation paper in this regard and had followed its up with an open house discussion to seek stakeholders' views, after receiving written comments.


  TRAI has recommended that "migration to unified numbering scheme which involves large scale changes in the existing network is not recommended at this stage.‚Äù


  "However, sufficient numbering resources can be made available for fixed line/ mobile services through alternative methods...," it said.


  TRAI suggested that sparingly used sub-levels in level '2', '3', '4', '5', and '6', should be withdrawn after seeking sub-level wise utilisation from the operators providing fixed line services.


  "Levels/ sub-levels allocated to some fixed line telecom service providers who have not launched their services even after one year of allocation, may also be withdrawn after seeking justification. These withdrawn levels should be reserved for future allocations for fixed line service providers," it said.


  It recommended that the mobile numbering resources surrendered by operators who have closed down their wireless operations, may be re-allocated to players who need more numbering resources.

 By no stretch of the imagination am I a math whiz; not even close.
 I'm pretty certain the statute of limitations have run out at this point, but let's just say I did quite a few English assignments for fellow classmates in exchange for them doing my math homework.
 That being said, I would guess there's a bunch, (yes, I guess that's an accurate math term), of folks who are super jazzed we've entered a new phase in this journey called COVID-19.
 Likewise, I know there's still a lot of people complaining where we're at now is not enough.
 It's important to keep in mind you gotta crawl before you walk.
 No one was prepared for the magnitude of this pandemic that descended upon us like a black cloud.

As unrest spread across dozens of American cities on Friday, the Pentagon took the rare step of ordering the Army to put several active-duty US military police units on the ready to deploy to Minneapolis, where the police killing of George Floyd sparked the widespread protests.
 Soldiers from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York have been ordered to be ready to deploy within four hours if called, according to three people with direct knowledge of the orders. Soldiers in Fort Carson, in Colorado, and Fort Riley in Kansas have been told to be ready within 24 hours. The people did not want their names used because they were not authorized to discuss the preparations.
 The get-ready orders were sent verbally on Friday, after President Donald Trump asked Defense Secretary Mark Esper for military options to help quell the unrest in Minneapolis after protests descended into looting and arson in some parts of the city.
 Trump made the request on a phone call from the Oval Office on Thursday night that included Esper, National Security Advisor Robert O' Brien and several others. The president asked Esper for rapid deployment options if the Minneapolis protests continued to spiral out of control, according to one of the people, senior Pentagon official who was on the call.
   
   
 "When the White House asks for options, someone opens the drawer and pulls them out so to speak," the official said.
 The person said the military units would be deployed under the Insurrection Act of 1807, which was last used in 1992 during the riots in Los Angeles that followed the Rodney King trial.
 "If this is where the president is headed response-wise, it would represent a significant escalation and a determination that the various state and local authorities are not up to the task of responding to the growing unrest," Brad Moss, a Washington DC-based attorney, who specializes in national security.
 Members of the police units were on a 30-minute recall alert early Saturday, meaning they would have to return to their bases inside that time limit in preparation for deployment to Minneapolis inside of four hours. Units at Fort Drum are slated to head to Minneapolis first, according to the three people, including two Defence Department officials. Roughly 800 US soldiers would deploy to the city if called.
 Protests erupted in Minneapolis this week after video emerged showing a police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck. Floyd later died of his injuries and the officer, Derek Chauvin, was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday.
 The protests turned violent and on Thursday rioters torched the Minneapolis Third Police Precinct near where Floyd was arrested. Mayor Jacob Frey ordered a citywide curfew at 8 pm beginning on Friday.
 The unrest has since spread across the country, with protests, some violent, erupting in cities including Washington DC, Atlanta, Phoenix, Denver and Los Angelas.
 Minnesota Governor Tim Walz ordered 500 of his National Guard troops into Minneapolis, St Paul, and surrounding communities.
 But a Pentagon spokesman said Walz did not ask for the Army to be deployed to his state.
 "The Department has been in touch with the Governor and there is no request for Title 10 forces to support the Minnesota National Guard or state law enforcement." Title 10 is the US law that governs the armed forces, and would authorise active duty military to operate within the US.
 Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications said the deployment of active-duty military police is untrue.
 "False: off the record - title 10 not under discussion," said Farah in an email response. No off-record agreement was negotiated with The Associated Press.
 The 16th Military Police Brigade forwarded the AP's questions to the Defence Department.
 The three officials with direct knowledge of the potential deployment say the orders are on a classified system, known as the Secret Internet Protocol Router or SIPR for short.
 Active-duty forces are normally prohibited from acting as a domestic law enforcement agency. But the Insurrection Act offers an exception.
 "The Insurrection Act would allow the military to take up a policing authority it otherwise would not be allowed to do, enforcing state and federal laws," said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas School of Law professor who specialises in constitutional and national security law.
 The statute "is deliberately vague" when it comes to the instances in which the Insurrection Act could be used, he said. The state's governor could ask President Donald Trump to take action or Trump could act on his own authority if he's determined that the local authorities are so overwhelmed that they can't adequately enforce the law, Vladeck said.
 "It is a very, very broad grant of authority for the president," he added.

Project manager Mateusz Romanow, who is on board of the ProteGO Safe team, says that the Polish solution does not require users to register with a mobile phone number, and this factor sets it apart from the apps introduced in other countries, like the Czech Republic or Norway. He underlines that "he is not and never will be the spokesman of the ministry," but at the same time he quickly adds that officials never wanted to push the team toward ethically unacceptable directions.
