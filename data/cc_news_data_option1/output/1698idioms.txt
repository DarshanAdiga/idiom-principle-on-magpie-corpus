Cinque trapianti in contemporanea all'Ismett di Palermo: cuore, polmoni, fegato e reni. Quattro équipe medico-chirurgiche impegnate, con oltre 50 operatori coinvolti, 4 sale operatorie attive per trapiantare in contemporanea 5 pazienti in lista d'attesa. Un evento di per sé straordinario, ancora più straordinario in questo periodo di emergenza coronavirus. "Cinque trapianti in contemporanea - sottolinea Angelo Luca, direttore di Ismett - richiedono organizzazione, lavoro di squadra e coordinamento tra i professionisti che lavorano all'interno della struttura, quelli che lavorano nelle rianimazioni del territorio e il centro trasfusionale dell'Arnas Civico. E' la dimostrazione di come l'emergenza coronavirus non abbia fermato la rete dei trapianti siciliana che è rimasta in grado di finalizzare il percorso di donazione-trapianto e di dare risposta ai pazienti in attesa". Sono 57 i trapianti eseguiti da Ismett nel 2020. "Già nel 2019 grazie all'impegno dell'assessorato della salute nel promuovere la donazione degli organi in Sicilia e al prezioso ruolo di coordinamento del centro regionale trapianti - aggiunge Angelo Luca - Ismett aveva eseguito 170 trapianti, di cui 32 da donatore vivente e molti di questi pazienti sono venuti da altre regioni o altri paesi". A rendere possibile gli interventi una donazione avvenuta nell'ospedale Giglio di Cefalù. Cuore, fegato e reni sono stati trapiantati a 4 pazienti siciliani. Ad essere sottoposto a trapianto di polmone anche un paziente pugliese che ha raggiunto Palermo grazie ad un aereo messo a disposizione dall'Aereonautica Militare. "In un periodo normale - sottolinea Ruggero Razza, assessore regionale alla Salute - sarebbe riduttivo definire straordinario ciò che è stato fatto nelle scorse ore a Palermo, ma con l'emergenza coronavirus tutto ciò assume un valore ancora più significativo. Ai professionisti impegnati nelle operazioni va tutto il nostro apprezzamento, un augurio di pronta guarigione, invece, ai pazienti. Un ringraziamento sincero, infine, a coloro i quali, con grande generosità, permettono ad altri di vivere una nuova vita".

Dehydrated food market can be segmented on the basis of technology which includes spray dried, freeze dried, vacuum dried, sun dried, hot air dried and others. Traditionally among all these segments sun dried process of dehydration was the major segment in terms of usage by food manufacturers followed by hot air dried process. However due to the introduction of new technology spray dried is expected to account for largest share in terms of market revenue contribution, followed by freeze dried during the forecast period. Vacuum dried segment is expected to show a consistent growth as compared to others. Limited usage in food products is expected to be the restraining factor for the growth of vacuum dried technology in dehydrated food market in the near future.

Magicmotorsport ha lavorato piu di un mese per raggiungere l'obiettivo e il risultato non era per nulla scontato -spiega Bogdan Skutkiewicz, CEO di Magicmotorsport. Con il dipartimento di Protezione Civile della Regione Siciliana, abbiamo concordato la distribuzione per Ospedali e Forze dell'Ordine. Vogliamo dimostrare la nostra vicinanza, la nostra stima, il nostro rispetto a tutti quelli che in questi mesi hanno lavorato e continuano a lavorare per tentare di contenere il diffondersi del COVID-19 nell'Isola e percio indipendentemente dal risultato delle verifiche avviate per l'ammanco dei dispositivi medici, completeremo la donazione appena possibile, consegnando il numero restante di mascherine. Abbiamo preso un impegno con la Sicilia e lo manterremo».

Francisco Ramírez peers through a hole in a fence while looking for an address to deliver a box of groceries to a man in need Saturday, April 18, 2020, in the Queens borough of New York. Some are former construction workers or cleaning ladies who lost their jobs and can barely pay rent, but they go out each day to deliver donated diapers, formula or food to families in need. Through Spanish-speaking chats in Facebook or word of mouth, small groups of immigrants find out who needs the help and they deliver it traveling by car or by foot, exposing themselves to the coronavirus that has already hit hard working-class neighborhoods.

I am impressed with management's strategy of focusing on more automated products now, delaying the production of those requiring manual labor to a later stage after the pandemic ends. For instance, OrganiGram says its Edison Bytes chocolate truffle can be produced with its automated production and packaging equipment. The company is also ensuring its production of medical cannabis continues in full swing to serve the patients who rely on its products.

Wonderwall.com is taking a look back at the stars who found love, suffered heartbreak or experienced some other major event in their love lives in late April 2020, starting with this surprising split... Kristin Cavallari and Jay Cutler took to Instagram on April 26 to announce that they're calling it quits after seven years of marriage and a decade of coupledom. "With great sadness, after 10 years together we have come to a loving conclusion to get a divorce. We have nothing but love and respect for one another and are deeply grateful for the years shared, memories made, and the children we are so proud of. This is just the situation of two people growing apart. We ask everyone to respect our privacy as we navigate this difficult time within our family," they each captioned a photo of themselves during happier times. Initially, multiple media outlets reported that the breakup is amicable \-- but has been a long time coming. "This isn't out of the blue. They've been trying to make it work for a while," said an E! News source. "There's nothing scandalous or suspect about their split. Honestly, they just fell out of love and grew apart," said an Us Weekly source. A People source, meanwhile, said the "Very Cavallari" stars "knew they were splitting up" before they left for a spring-break vacay in the Bahamas in early March. "Kristin and Jay had been having problems for a long time. They hadn't spent much time together in recent months," said the source. "[They] are a lot different. She has so much on her plate, with her brands and with the show, and Jay is not as interested in all of that. She's so passionate about her work and they couldn't relate to each other. So it pulled them apart." Then multiple media outlets got their hands on the former couple's divorce documents, and things took a strange turn...
