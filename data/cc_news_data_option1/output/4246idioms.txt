With millions of votes already cast, Biden’s lead in the polls appears strong. The campaigns appear to be moving in opposite directions on paper, but it’s a very different feeling on the campaign trail. Trump is drawing huge crowds reminiscent of 2016′s final days. Biden is sticking to his cautious approach with tiny events focused more on social distancing than energizing supporters.

I remember we were in Detroit for a gig. Tom had told Howie to go get well. He didn't care where he was going. He said he'd pay for it. He said, "Just go and get well." Tom had had enough of it. Howie never, ever called me up, but he called and said, "Come up to my room." I wandered up and there was blackened silver foil all over the place. I looked around the room and looked at Howie and said, "What are you going to do? Where are you going to go?"

In his note, Bein praised White as a musician and producer and credited him with helping launch True Panther and turning it into a favored indie label. "True Panther wouldn't exist without you,” he said. “My life would be fundamentally different without you… Ten years on and I'm trying to catch the memories bursting out like drinking out of a fire hose. So many of them imbued with an air of mischief and chaos, of trying to figure out this weird new life on the fly. You made it difficult to be your friend quite often, but also easy to come back. I can't count all of the conversations I've had with people that recount with a kind of shellshocked realness the feeling of being sucked into this Girls world, or your world — a bad kids army, feeling like it's the only place to be, but you probably shouldn't stay long.”

Well, we did that one gig at the Royal Albert Hall [in 1992]. Eric didn't come to that. I think he really didn't want to be there in Japan, for whatever reason. I don't know. And so Mike Campbell came over and was the second guitarist. Nathan couldn't make it. George said, "Do you know any bass players that might want to come and do this?" Will Lee is such a huge Beatles fan. I said, "I know just the guy in New York." I called up Will and said, "Do you want to come and play with George Harrison?" He was just over the moon. He's owed me ever since for that call.

The first half of it began around October of 1992. I came back around June of 1993 and we did the second half. I really enjoyed being back in the studio in a band situation. But there was a bit of a learning curve with the Heartbreakers since it was all about the song. Tom's songwriting is so strong that they kept it really simple to just present that song. Every once in a while., I could do a little something, but it had to be really, really straight down the line.

That was the beginning of me playing with Clapton and that was one of my busiest periods when I was playing with Duran Duran and Clapton. I spent only about three weeks at home that year. That was when I had to really, seriously think about giving up the Saturday Night Live seat. It wasn't fair to keep it. There were other people that could have used that seat for some income, so I resigned my seat and got really busy.

I had so much fun. This guy could just throw out song after song after song. And he would throw away songs. Wildflowers sounded a lot different than the other stuff I had heard from Tom Petty. It was a different-sounding record. Every once in a while he'd come up with another song and I'd be like, "Oh, this sounds more like Tom Petty in the vein of the old Tom Petty that I know." We'd start to play it. We'd play it three or four times and he'd just go, "No. We've been here before." And he'd just throw it away. I was wondering, "What the hell is he doing? This is a great song."
