Walt Disney Co's deal to buy film, television and international businesses from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc will value the latter at over $40 per share, or $75 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.
 The deal, which is set to be announced on Thursday, will end more than half a century of expansion by Murdoch, 86, who turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at age 21 into one of the world's most important global news and film conglomerates.
 Under the terms of the all-stock deal, Fox assets that will be sold to Disney, including the Twentieth Century Fox movie and TV studio, cable networks and international operations will be valued at around $29 per share, the source said on Wednesday.
 Fox's remaining assets, focused on news and sports, will be offered to existing Fox shareholders in a new company likely to be valued at more than $11 per share, according to the source, who asked not to be identified ahead of an official announcement.
 Disney and Fox did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Fox shares ended trading on Wednesday at $32.75, giving it a market capitalization of around $60 billion. The Wall Street Journal first reported the exact terms of the deal.
 The deal will mark a return by Murdoch to focus on the news business, his lifelong passion. Australian-born Murdoch inherited his father's newspaper business in 1952 and transformed it over many years, acquiring premiere properties such as the Wall Street Journal, the London Times and the 20th Century Fox movie studio.
 Murdoch's shift to selling assets rather than buying them has come as a surprise to many who expected him to hand over the businesses to his sons, James and Lachlan.
 None of the Murdochs are expected to be given board seats at Disney, according to the sources.
 Disney has been struggling to bolster its TV business as cancellation of cable subscriptions is pressuring its biggest network, sports channel ESPN.
 The Fox deal brings marquee franchises inside the Mouse House, on top of Disney CEO Bob Iger's previous purchases, including Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and "Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm.
 Disney also will buy Fox's stake in the Hulu video streaming service, giving it majority control of the competitor to Netflix Inc. Hulu also is partially owned by Comcast Corp and Time Warner Inc.
 Under the deal, Disney will gain access to 46 million subscribers in three major markets, the United States, Western Europe and India, according to Barclays analysts.
 It also diversifies Disney's revenue as U.S. cable television subscribers decline. Fox's Star business in India, for example, is projected to earn $1 billion before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2020, Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said at a Business Insider conference in November.
 It is not clear how the deal will be treated by U.S. antitrust regulators, given that it looks set to reduce competition among movie studios. The U.S. Department of Justice recently sued to block AT&T Inc's $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc, on the basis that it will raise prices for consumers and competitors.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Another cruise ship with coronavirus victims on board, including two fatalities, is docking in Florida.Princess Cruises spokeswoman Negin Kamali said in an email Saturday the Coral Princess ship is docking in Miami. The ship with 1,020 passengers and 878 crew members has been in limbo for days awaiting permission to dock.As of Thursday, Kamali said seven passengers and five crew members had tested positive for the coronavirus.Anyone in need of hospitalization will disembark first, the cruise line said, although it wasn't immediately clear when that would happen. Those who are fit to fly will begin leaving on Sunday, while others who have symptoms of respiratory illness will remain on board until cleared by ship doctors.A day earlier, the cruise ships Zaandam and Rotterdam were permitted to dock at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, with 14 critically ill people taken immediately to hospitals. The remaining passengers were slowly being allowed to board flights for home.The Coral Princess had been on a South American cruise that was due to end March 19 in Buenos Aires. Since then, the ship has encountered obstacles to docking because of various port closures and cancellation of airline flights, the cruise line said.Passengers have self-isolated in their staterooms and meals have been delivered by room service. Crew members also have remained in their quarters when they are not working.The Coast Guard said in a news release Saturday it has been involved with processing about 120 vessels carrying some 250,000 passengers over the past three weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic.The Coast Guard statement said as of Saturday there are 114 cruise ships, carrying 93,000 crew members, either in or near U.S. ports and waters. That includes 73 cruise ships, with 52,000 crew members, moored or anchored in U.S. ports and anchorages. Another 41 cruise ships, with 41,000 crew members, are underway and close to the U.S.The cruise line industry announced a voluntarily suspension of most ship operations from U.S. ports on March 13. The next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a “no sail” order to all cruise ships that had not suspended operations.“We commend the decision by the cruise industry to cease operations. However, pausing a global tourist industry does not happen instantaneously or easily,” said Vice Admiral Dan Abel, Coast Guard Deputy Commandant for Operations. “The federal, state, local and industry cooperation to achieve this feat truly represents the whole-of- nation approach directed by the president and is essential to fighting the spread of this virus and working to minimize the loss of life.”Princess Cruises is a brand of Miami-based Carnival Corp., the world’s largest cruise company.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Troy Deeney has revealed Watford players identified Fred as Manchester United's main weakness when the two sides met earlier in the year.
 United secured a 3-0 win over Watford at the end of February in a close game which saw the visitors threaten early and see a goal ruled out by VAR.
 Looking back on the game Deeney thought his side were unlucky not to take anything from the Old Trafford encounter, and he has revealed how Watford's tactics looked to exploit Fred in midfield.
 “I thought Bruno [Fernandes] was very good, surprised me how good he was," Deeney told The United Stand.
 “I liked Fred – although he gives the ball away a lot he always wants it. So sometimes you see a player lose the ball and then they just go safe, backwards, left, right, he’s just like, ‘Alright, I lost it, but next one’.

"I'm absolutely buzzing to get it done and dusted," said Tomlin.
 "The fans stuck by me no matter what and I'm starting to repay them.
 "I think that's why I had no intention of going anywhere else, because, for me, they've been unbelievable.
 "Every time I start a game and you go out at home it brings a smile and a shiver down my spine. I just want to do well for them as well."
 The words struck a chord with City fans, who felt like they had been taken on this rollercoaster of a journey with him and they were over the moon he had committed to be a Bluebird for at least two more years.
 Goals against Birmingham City, West Brom and Luton Town followed, with Tomlin showing no signs of slowing down. Was he going to single-handedly drag Cardiff into the play-off spots?
 But, beneath it all during the January transfer window, there was a fear which gripped City fans.
 "What if he gets injured?"
 It prompted Cardiff fans to urge the club to sign another playmaker, someone who could fill the void if the worst happened.
 Harris admitted he tried and failed in a pursuit of at least one player who could provide back-up for Tomlin and it left City bare in that position.
 When WalesOnline learned of the extent of Tomlin's injury ahead of their away trip to Stoke City in February, it felt like a hammer blow to City's chances.
 He had done his knee while sprinting back 40 yards to defend during a training drill and the subsequent diagnosis was bleak. Out for eight weeks at best, the season at worst.
 A feckless performance without him resulted in a 2-0 defeat at the bet365 Stadium, before Nottingham Forest claimed a 1-0 win at Cardiff City Stadium just a few days later.
 The Bluebirds were desperately missing that spark and absence was certainly making the hearts grow fonder as fans pined for Tomlin, who had risen to become their talisman.

Liverpool on Saturday became the latest Premier League club to put some of their non-playing staff on furlough during the coronavirus shutdown. The Premier League said on Friday that the 2019/20 season would only return when it was "safe and appropriate to do so". Newcastle, Tottenham, Bournemouth and Norwich have also said they would furlough non-playing staff.
 A statement from the Premier League leaders said staff would be paid 100 percent of their salaries to ensure nobody was financially disadvantaged.
 The Liverpool statement added: "Even prior to the decision on staff furloughing, there was a collective commitment at senior levels of the club -- on and off the pitch -- with everyone working towards a solution that secures jobs for employees of the club during this unprecedented crisis.
 "There is ongoing active engagement about the topic of salary deductions during the period matches are not being played to schedule. These discussions are complex and as a result the process is ongoing."
 Liverpool are 25 points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, on the verge of winning their first top-flight title since 1990.

Britain is unlikely to lift its stringent lockdown rules until the end of May, a leading government adviser said on Saturday, warning that the spread of the coronavirus must first slow and intense testing be introduced. The government has put Britain into a widespread shutdown, closing pubs, restaurants and nearly all shops, while ordering people to stay home unless absolutely essential to venture out. The order is designed to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country, which has almost 40,000 confirmed cases and 3,605 deaths, but some experts have started to question whether the shuttering of the economy will cost more lives in the long run.

Upholding the musical values of the GNB school, Trichur V.Ramachandran was at his best during a concert organised by Meenakshi Sundararajan Fine Arts at KRS Auditorium. He once again proved his virtuosity and the audience responded with delight. It was pleasing to see college students attending as well as managing the show. I wish more colleges in Chennai follow suit.
 The recital highlighted the musical responses of violinist M.A. Sundareswaran that built up a fine collaborative atmosphere.
 Trichur Ramachandran began with GNB’s famous Ranjani varnam that was full of vintage grace.
 The singer’s repertoire comprised timeless pieces. For instance, ‘Saraseeruha’ (Nata) with brisk swaraprasthara set the tone for the evening. It led to more elaborate kritis.
 The singer etched a neat Bilahari before the kriti ‘Ekadantam Bhajeham.’ With niraval on ‘Kailasa natham kumaram karthigeya manoharam,’ it was time for quicksilver repartees in swaraprasthara.
 Another favourite followed after a compact Anandabhairavi raga alapana. The kriti was Periyasami Thooran's ‘Samagana priye’ (Anandabhairavi).
 The audience greatly appreciated the Dikshitar kriti ‘Thyagarajaya namaste’ in Begada that came up next. The artiste then rendered a vigorous Suddhadhanyasi raga alapana and ‘Sri Hari Vallabhe,’ bringing alive composer Vasudevachar’s musical aesthetics.
 Ramachandran’s swaraprasthara was replete with bhava to which violinist M.A. Sundareswaran’s reply came in equally inspired phrasing. Before the central piece, Tyagaraja's ‘Ethavunara,’ the veteran vocalist posited Kalyani raga, revelling in intricate tara sthayi sancharas.
 At the end of the kriti, deeply meditative kalpanaswara enriched the atmosphere before Ramachandran rendered fast-paced swaras.
 GNB's ‘Ninnu pogada tarama’ (Kuntalavarali), an evocative ragamalika slokam, and ‘Muralidhara’ (Maund) completed the line up. Mridangist R. Ramesh provided adequate support but his thani was a tad aggressive.

WASHINGTON -- Michigan could be facing between 1,000 and 4,500 deaths from the novel coronavirus even with mitigation efforts fully in place, according to a model cited by President Donald Trump and his medical advisers on Tuesday.
   
 The worst is expected in the next two weeks, Trump said, noting that a spike in cases in southeastern Michigan caught his administration and others by surprise.
   
 "Detroit is having a really hard time," Trump said at a briefing of his Coronavirus Task Force at the White House. "It came out of nowhere. ... This could be a hell of a bad two weeks."
   
 Trump and his experts say, however, that social distancing and other more drastic measures to stop the spread ordered by governors and other officials are working, and that the death toll will be far worse if people don't practice them, as recommended by the White House, at least through the end of April.
   
 The model projects a median number of about 85,000 deaths across the U.S. with most coming between now and June 1, though it also suggests the number could be as low as about 40,000 and as high as 160,000. Trump and other White House officials said the model could actually be low, however, saying there could be between 100,000 to 240,000 deaths, based on what has been seen in other countries, including Italy.
   
 The peak in the number of deaths for Michigan is expected to come in the next 10 days, the model predicts, with 164 deaths in the state on April 11, though that is only a statistical projection and could be higher or lower. It also could be impacted by how well residents continue take steps to avoid spreading the virus.
   
 The median of the model's range of deaths caused by coronavirus in Michigan would be 3,007, with almost all between now and the end of April if the model is correct. It was cited Tuesday by Dr. Deborah Birx, a top official on Trump's task force.
   
 "The surge is coming," Trump said, adding that he spoke with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer about sending more supplies to the state. Metro Detroit has been noted by experts for its increasing rate of cases with 259 deaths and more than 7,600 cases as of Tuesday afternoon.
   
 "This is going to be one of the roughest two or three weeks we've ever had in this country," Trump said. "When you see the sort of numbers that we're witnessing, we've never seen anything like that."
   
 The president urged all Americans to continue taking precautions. He described it as "a great national trial."
   
 The model was created by Chris Murray, a researcher at the University of Washington at Seattle, and is based on data already taken from cases and death rates in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere. It also indicates Michigan could need an additional 1,800 ventilators and 1,500 more intensive care unit beds.
   
 Murray formerly worked for the World Health Organization and is director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
   
 "The question is what would have happened if we did nothing," said Trump, whose advisers say social distancing and stay-at-home orders issued in Michigan and many other states are working. "Up to 2.2 million people ... would have died if we did nothing."

Our communications efforts are busier than ever as we provide information from a variety of sources as it pertains to residents in the city of Tehachapi. Our recently launched podcast, "TehachaPod," has several new episodes where we check in with Assemblyman Vince Fong, local communications and journalism professionals and those at the Kern County Library in regard to how to access resources while the library is physically closed. The show is now available on all major podcast platforms and we believe all our remotely recorded shows have valuable information for listeners.
 Also, this past week our public works department installed our American flags on the light posts in downtown. The flags normally aren’t installed until Memorial Day, but we thought it was critical during this challenging time to remind our residents that the United States of America has been challenged before and been victorious and this too will be a victory for our country and the American way of life when it passes. To extend that sentiment, I’m challenging all residents, both in the city of Tehachapi and the outskirts, to proudly display their flags as well in a movement of solidarity for our country and our fellow man.
 As we will recover, city staff is also focused on those efforts too. We know that eventually life will get back to normal and that means being prepared for that reality. We are working with organizations that host special events and community gatherings to figure out a way to celebrate our return to regular life whenever that may be. We have people working on assisting our small businesses in acquiring enough capital to remain solvent during closure or reduced hours as the multitude of assistance packages become available.
 We are trying to predict what our new economy might look like after this passes and I am confident that the city of Tehachapi will be a leader in Kern County in addressing that new business climate and creating a place where business can once again thrive. We are planning on recovery as we speak while at the same time addressing the crisis head on. It’s a balancing act, but an important one to ensure when we return to normal that we hit the ground running as we always have.
 Stay safe, stay home if possible and please reach out to me with any questions or concerns: ggarrett@tehachapicityhall.com.
