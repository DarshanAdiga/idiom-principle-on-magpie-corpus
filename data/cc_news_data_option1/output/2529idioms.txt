Regula protocolos de prevención y el día a día de los centros tras la pandemia
    BARCELONA, 28 Jun. (EUROPA PRESS) -
    El comité técnico del Procicat ha aprobado el Plan sectorial de recuperación de la normalidad en el ámbito residencial de la Generalitat, que da respuesta "a las necesidades de las personas que viven en centros residenciales" y prevé medidas para identificar de forma precoz casos de Covid-19 en las residencias catalanas.
    El plan busca priorizar la recuperación de la normalidad en el día a día de los centros, "pero siempre garantizando las medidas de prevención adecuadas dada la vulnerabilidad de los residentes", ha explicado la Conselleria de Salud en un comunicado este domingo.
    El documento establece los criterios y recomendaciones para detectar contagios y aislar a pacientes, además de establecer las directrices para las salidas y visitas de familiares a residentes.
    A partir de ahí, cada centro "deberá aplicar las medidas adaptando la organización en función de su estructura y recursos, y las características y necesidades de las personas que conviven".
 ## CONTROLES MÉDICOS
    Además, el plan propone que todos los residentes y profesionales que trabajan en centros pasen controles clínicos y epidemiológicos diarios, salvo "los que no sean ya casos confirmados o probables de Covid-19 o hayan superado la enfermedad".
    En función de los grupos de riesgo que acojan, las residencias clasificarán sus espacios en zonas "verdes, amarillas y rojas", respectivamente, para personas sin Covid-19, residentes sospechosos de infección y cuarentena, y casos confirmados de coronavirus.
    Para aceptar nuevos ingresos, las residencias deberán cumplir "criterios de estabilidad en relación con su situación de control de la infección por coronavirus", siguiendo las valoraciones del equipo territorial de Salud Pública.

In light of conversations in Colorado Springs between the mayor and the City Council, I strongly recommend that independent civilian oversight be considered and evaluated fully. There are a myriad models to research but few appointed boards are considered effective oversight without full legislative and financial independence, (especially from law enforcement) without clear guidelines for access to documents, data and records from the law enforcement department and command staff, and without specific and regular contact with the larger community through public reporting and outreach. Many effective oversight models also have professional investigators, policy experts and an outreach team to improve the lack of community trust and faith in law enforcement. Teachers, doctors and many other professionals are overseen and audited professionally to ensure that quality and ethics are achieved in a particular field.


  Established in 1995, NACOLE is a nonprofit organization founded on the belief that policing should be fair and consistent, and that independent civilian oversight leads to more effective policing and safer communities. Having had the opportunity to meet and discuss community trust and law enforcement accountability with community members and law enforcement from Colorado Springs in March, it is apparent that your city has an incredible opportunity to find solutions to these problems among all stakeholders. While the lack of trust is unfortunate, it is not rare in any American city.


  In some cities, it takes several critical incidents like the shooting of Bailey to create the political will and community outrage to begin the discussion about independent civilian oversight. Meanwhile, public safety is highly compromised without community trust and cooperation in policing.


  Colorado Springs has a unique window with a broad alliance of community, government, and law enforcement stakeholders to explore the best way for your city to improve public trust of law enforcement. I highly encourage you to take advantage of this energy and commitment to find an independent oversight model that serves everyone. Law enforcement is funded by taxpayers and should be accountable to the community.


  NACOLE is the preeminent civilian oversight association in the U.S. and our membership and board of directors are the leading experts in the field of civilian oversight. We offer extensive training to the growing community of civilian oversight practitioners, law enforcement officials, community advocates, and other accountability experts. NACOLE also provides support to communities working to create oversight such as Colorado Springs.


  Please take the time to utilize national expertise and research the benefits of independent oversight for the Colorado Springs community. On behalf of the board of directors of NACOLE, we pledge that we will be a resource as your community discusses your public safety needs during this crucial time in history.


  Counterpoint: Vincent NiskiLaw enforcement is an ever-changing profession. It is constantly evolving to reflect new best practices, meet the specific needs of our community, and everything in between. While we embrace change and progress forward, I do not believe that improvement requires the dismantling of our current system.


  We are proud to be your police department, and I am exceptionally honored to lead this organization whose work, compassion and commitment is second to none.


  The department has dedicated resources to training officers in crisis intervention, using the model championed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness. So far, 327 officers have successfully completed the training.

The hundreds of Israelis falling sick with COVID-19 on a daily basis has left the government fumbling with indecision, rather than inspiring it to take charge of the growing health crisis that experts warn is rapidly spinning out of control.
 The coronavirus cabinet met for two hours on Sunday but left with no decisions, ensuring that the status quo will continue, and that the virus will keep spreading throughout the country.  

 It is not a positive sign for Israel, whose prime minister lauded himself for maintaining the first wave of the virus, and through a series of extreme but necessary measures, limiting the number of severely ill and dead.
 "There is no change in the virus," stressed Prof. Jonathan Gershoni from Tel Aviv University's School of Molecular Cell Biology and Biotechnology. "The virus has not weakened."
 He said that the only difference is that Israel now has hundreds of sick people in every city and the precautions that need to be taken to prevent a lockdown are not being taken seriously by the public, the Health Ministry or the government.
 Moreover, it is becoming ever more apparent that the government did not use the lockdown to prepare for life in the shadow of coronavirus, which most experts understand is here for at least another year. Rather, there has been little or no strategic planning, as was evidenced by the rapid decision to open schools without any testing procedure in place.
 The result is an increasing number of sick people.
 While the numbers show that younger people are being infected now - perhaps because the "second wave," if one wants to call it that, started in the schools - Gershoni pointed out that for every 400 to 600 people infected each day, around 40 of them are over the age of 65. As such, it is only a matter of time until, with the increase of general numbers, the country sees an increase in serious cases and deaths. Hopefully, he said, that increase will not be uncontrollable or untreatable, as has always been the fear.
 Nearly all health experts offer the same strategy: Test widely, carry out quick epidemiological investigations to stop the infection chains and isolate the sick. At the same time, the government must step up enforcement of Health Ministry regulations, fining people who gather in large crowds and who do not wear masks.
 Under newly appointed Health Minister Yuli Edelstein, the Health Ministry has increased daily testing. Last week, there was a day in which more than 19,000 people were screened for coronavirus. However, the number of tests taken per day is not the only issue. The labs must process these tests quickly and provide a response to those who take them.  

 Over the weekend, head of public health, Dr. Sigal Sadetsky, said that the labs have not been able to keep up with the workload amid the recent rise in infection rates due to a lack of manpower.
 Moreover, although the Health Ministry said it hired 300 new epidemiological trackers, there has yet to be any change in the time it takes to complete each investigation, which can sometimes be as long as five days, according to Health Ministry director-general Chezy Levy.
 On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the coronavirus cabinet to reduce the epidemiological investigation process time - from the time of the patient's detection to the introduction of all his isolation contacts - from 48 hours to 12 hours.
 But as Gershoni pointed out, until now there has been a lot of talk and less action.
 Moreover, there are daily news reports of crowds on Israel's beaches, at soccer games or wedding halls.  

 The government must increase enforcement of those who break the rules, health experts continue to stress. While there has been an increase in fines, according to Police, it is clearly not enough.
 Hadar Marom, deputy director of Samson Assuta Ashdod University Hospital, told _The Jerusalem Post_ in a separate interview that the government must attack mask-wearing the way it approached the use of seat belts in cars.  

 "Remember we started to use seat belts while driving our cars?" she asked. "It was not easy to implement and people did not understand that they needed to use them."
 She said that the government ran a robust advertising campaign targeted toward the country's different sectors and police would pull over cars and fine drivers who were not buckled up.
 "Now we get inside our car and put on our seat belt," she said. "It has to happen with masks, too."
 Finally, it is time that the Health Ministry appoints a director of "hasbara," someone who can better communicate the need to comply with the directives to the various sectors, and who can explain the dangers that will emerge if compliance is not put into effect.
 Edelstein lashed out at his colleagues for populism on Sunday evening and claimed that at the coronavirus cabinet meeting in the morning he had warned them to start taking the virus more seriously.
 But the fact that the cabinet did not make even one decision on Sunday makes it appear that Edelstein's words fell on deaf ears.
 "I believe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, the tunnel is rather long," Gershoni stressed. "We have to learn to live with corona. If not, we are going to run into trouble."

I've been known to cheat at board games, poker and my driver's license stats, but never on my dentist.
   
 No one enjoys going to the dentist, but after waiting for three months to get his teeth cleaned - because of the COVID - he was up and ready to go for his checkup. "Now, that's a little weird," I thought to myself. "Who wants to get their teeth cleaned?"
   
 After going to the same dentist for more than 30 years, I figured what would it hurt to try someone new? I hadn't planned on checking out a new dentist, but when his tooth guy retired and he fell head over heels in like with the new, young, attractive tooth goddess, who bought out the practice, I felt the need to check her out under the guise of having my teeth cleaned.
   
 I made my appointment convinced there was no way I'd give up my dentist who had been cleaning my teeth so long he probably had them memorized. I wanted to find fault in something - anything - which would convince me to stay put with my dentist who I'd memorized every hair follicle on his head. By the time I left the new dentist's office, I'd made another appointment, and, as much as I didn't want to admit, was looking forward to it.
   
 I'm not sure how to ditch a dentist, but it appears as though our 30-year relationship is going to be over. Maybe because the new gal reminds us of our adult daughters, or, maybe for the fact she was quick, efficient and cute as a bug (even with a shield, face mask and scrubs on). This dentist's most alluring trait is to concentrate on saving the teeth versus just pulling them out.
   
 I don't worry about getting older but I really don't want to lose my teeth. I think about it so much I often dream of looking in a mirror and all of my teeth are loose (or it could be because I have periodontal disease and my gums are receding).
   
 I will do most anything to avoid a toothache. Even mild-mannered people turn into mean maniacs with pain that is relentless, unless you can knock yourself out with strong medicine or find someone to pull the culprit out.
   
 Funny how the life cycle brings everything back around, sooner or later. The 7-year-old grandsons are losing teeth right and left and think it's the best thing since sliced bread. I'm doing everything in my power to keep from losing just one.
   
 The new dentist lady suggested a Water Pik and believe me, I didn't waste any time buying one. When I walked in the door, with the Water Pik in tow, he didn't have to ask, since he too had purchased one for himself.
   
 Too bad we don't heed the advice of dentists before we go over the hill. It sure would save a lot of time staring at the top of their heads.

Financial fallout from the pandemic is hitting millennials hard -- and many will soon turn to their parents for help, if they haven't already.


  Before parents ride to the rescue, financial planners urge them to map out a strategy that doesn't just plug a short-term need but also makes sense in the long run.


  "Often the heartstrings will get pulled -- 'I really have to help them!'-- but it can be detrimental to the parent," says certified financial planner Jeffrey L. Corliss of Westport, Connecticut.


  (Of course, financial aid can flow the other way, as many millennials help support their parents. I'm addressing parents here, but most of the advice applies to kids helping their folks as well.)


  MILLENNIALS LOSING JOBS, INCOME


  Even before the pandemic, millennials had lower median incomes, far more debt and a much smaller slice of the nation's wealth than boomers had at the same age. Millennials -- usually defined as those ages 24 to 39 -- are more likely than older generations to have lost jobs or household income because of the pandemic, various surveys show.


  "I've already seen clients coming in, worried about their kids," says CFP Deborah Badillo of Miami. "'They're going to lose the house! What can I do to help them?'"


  HAVE THEM EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES


  Encourage your kids to take full advantage of available financial help before extending yours, Badillo says. They may not know, for example, that unemployment benefits have been dramatically expanded because of the pandemic. Weekly payments are higher and are available to people who normally wouldn't qualify, including gig workers, the self-employed and people whose hours have been reduced.


  In addition, there are many more options for people struggling to pay debt. Most mortgages qualify for forbearance programs that allow homeowners to skip payments for up to a year. Hardship programs have been added or expanded by credit card companies and other lenders. Federal student loan payments have been paused until Sept. 30, and income-driven programs can reduce payment amounts after that.


  Another option is a coronavirus hardship withdrawal, which allows people to tap their IRAs and 401(k)s without penalty if they were physically or financially affected by COVID-19. The withdrawals are taxable, but if the money is paid back within three years those taxes are refundable. Raiding retirement funds isn't ideal, of course, but your kids have many more years to replenish their retirement savings than you do.


  ASSESS YOUR OWN SITUATION


  While your kids are filing for unemployment and calling their lenders, take a moment to assess your own finances. Where will the cash for your kids come from? It's one thing to give away money you've been saving for a vacation, since you're unlikely to travel soon anyway. It's quite another to undermine your own ability to retire or handle a layoff or other setback.


  Some parents make a conscious decision to operate with a smaller cushion, or to delay their retirements, to help their children, says CFP Lazetta Rainey Braxton in New York. Just keep in mind that you may not get to decide when you retire. Many workers retire earlier than expected, often because of a health problem or job loss. Helping your children now could mean you have to lean on them later, Braxton says. If you're not sure how this financial aid will impact your future finances, a consultation with a fee-only financial advisor could bring you some clarity.


  SET SOME BOUNDARIES


  Financial planners typically recommend deciding how much to give, and then setting clear boundaries about when the financial help will end. That's tricky now, of course, because no one knows how long the current economic crisis will last.


  But parents can still set expectations in other ways, financial planners say. If the child didn't have an emergency fund, for example, parents can discuss the importance of saving money out of every future paycheck, so the child won't have to rely on family help again, Braxton says.


  "Some parents will just put on a Band-Aid and give them money, but they really haven't helped in terms of their financial capacity," Braxton says.


  If an adult child is moving back home, Corliss suggests a written contract outlining chores and responsibilities, such as how soon they'll be expected to move out after finding a job. A similar end date can be set for any cash the parents hand out. Corliss says the message should be clear: "We expect you to get on your feet as soon as you can."
