But wait. Not so fast. Trump can then use that refusal of a governor to send Trump electors to Congress as an excuse to call in the US Supreme Court to decide the issue. Trump’s lawyers will then argue to the Court there isn’t a complete electoral college vote total to determine the outcome of the election if one or more governors don’t send in the results. The Supreme Court would then likely ‘pass the buck’ and order the decision on the election referred to the US House of Representatives, per the US Constitution.

As for the rest of the film, there is a bit of news as THR's report also brings word that Narcos: Mexico actor Tenoch Huerta has joined the production as one of its main antagonists. Your guess is as good as mine as to just which role he's going to play though. We've already seen Black Panther's two most iconic villains in Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and Klaw (Andy Serkis), not to mention Man-Ape, who was reinvented as frenemy M'Baku (Winston Duke). The problem is Black Panther has never had the best rogues gallery and the remaining great villains - namely, Namor the Submariner and White Wolf - are all closely tied to T'Challa and not Shuri, if she is to be the new Black Panther (and there's the small issue of Namor's tangled movie rights). But I guess now that a plan is in place, we may start seeing some details coming out.

Greenwood County Emergency Management Coordinator George McKinney received recognition from a regional organization Wednesday.
 Ten at the Top, a regional organization covering 10 counties in the Upstate, honored 10 county representatives as a part of their Celebrating Upstate Unsung Heroes virtual event.
 McKinney was selected among four nominees from Greenwood County to be honored as an unsung hero.
 “It was a shock,” McKinney said. “I’m very honored to be recognized.”
 Uptown Greenwood Manager Lara Hudson, Emerald Ink and Stitching owner Steve Riley and Greenwood County School District 50 Director of Child Nutrition Amy Stabler were also nominated from the county.
 More than 130 nominees were honored as Upstate Unsung Heroes during the event.
 The novel coronavirus pandemic changed how the organization conducts its annual presentation. Traditionally, the organization would have a large luncheon for the nominees and their families. This year’s virtual event featured music from the Brooks Dixon Band and was emceed by WSPA anchor Amy Woods.
 Woods read the recommendation of McKinney written by Greenwood County Manager Toby Chappell
 “When the COVID-19 pandemic started impacting our community, George led the effort to become the clearinghouse for communication with strategic sectors in the community,” Chappell wrote in his nomination of McKinney. “He should simply be known as a hero to many in our community and no longer an unsung one.”
 Ethan Cornick, an 8-year-old from Abbeville, received the award on behalf of that county. Cornick is an ambassador with Dreams with Open Arms and was also honored during the presentation.

In the last one decade, as we witnessed is a huge increase in women voters turnouts in Bihar, it is of crucial importance to raise issue of gender quota beyond local level. But before we go ahead, we need a pause to think about gender quota with a new perspective, that is to have a gender quota which fairly represents women of different categories. As we know that women from marginalised communities are subject to multidimensional oppressions as they are at the intersection of caste/religion and gender, while we amplify our voice for gender quota, we need to be cautious enough to talk (in the same breath) about quota within gender quota for marginalised women. Otherwise, quota would not make much difference as it would benefit women of upper caste with political lineage.
