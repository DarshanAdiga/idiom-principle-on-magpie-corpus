Private equity firms are prolonging the shelf lives of their aging assets with deals that are proving increasingly popular with managers, but not with all investors.Firms under pressure to offload assets from their expiring funds are opting to repackage them into new vehicles as the pandemic curbs the usual exit routes via sales or initial public offerings. This once obscure corner of the private equity industry has grabbed Wall Street's attention, with the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. joining investors and Citigroup Inc. advising on deals.Buyout firms are becoming more inventive as business models that usually cap a fund's lifespan at a decade prove too rigid for Covid-stricken markets. As well as offering an alternative exit route for investors wanting to cash in their holdings, so-called general partner-led secondary deals allow firms to keep top-performing assets and juice even more returns from them -- often meaning even higher fees."The market used to be the Wild West," said Harold Hope, head of Goldman's secondaries investment unit in New York. "Even two years ago we saw some managers go to their investors with GP-led deals and get shot down. Deals are more stable now. There are better standards."In July, Goldman led investors in a $1 billion deal that enabled private equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC to shift renewable energy firm Enviva Holdings into a new separate fund. When Permira decided to repackage four companies from its maturing flagship fund in May, Coller Capital led investors in an $829 million deal. In both cases, some investors cashed out entirely.But with the manager as both buyer and seller, the deals come with a health warning. Investor body Institutional Limited Partners Association has cautioned about conflicts of interest and urged that investors are on board, while the Securities and Exchange Commission has waved similar red flags. Another concern is that managers can undervalue assets when moving them, and so trigger higher performance fees upon their next revaluation."Managers might try to take advantage of Covid-depressed prices and set themselves up with nice lower valuations," said Simon Saitowitz, a specialist in secondaries deals and partner at law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. In the past few months, he's fielded more requests for GP-led restructurings than for the whole of last year.While asset valuations has been a focus of the US regulator, it's also looked at allocation of transaction fees, expenses and broker fees, and whether such deals have been conducted in accordance with the underlying agreements, law firm Torys said in a report last year.When London- based Permira carried out its May transaction, the firm sought to allay investor concerns by keeping the same terms for those that opted to stay in, said a person familiar with the deal. Around a third of the original investors took the opportunity to exit, said the person. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.The advisory side has typically been dominated by boutiques like Evercore Inc. and Campbell Lutyens, but no longer. Citigroup has worked on the transactions since 2017 and now has a 17-person team, according to Anthony Diamandakis, global co-head of asset managers.BC Partners recently decided to postpone a listing of academic publisher Springer Nature, which could have been Germany's biggest IPO in more than a year, Bloomberg News reported this month. It also considered a potential GP-led deal for the investment, people with knowledge of the matter said. A spokesperson for BC Partners declined to comment.Second-Hand BoomRarely used until about a decade ago, the value of GP-led deals surged to a record $26 billion last year. Since the pandemic upended markets, managers who wouldn't normally talk to secondaries experts are interested, said Gabriel Boghossian, partner in the private equity team at Stephenson Harwood. He even interrupted a holiday to work on three such deals.The growth in demand points to booming interest in the broader secondaries market, where some $80 billion of fund assets were traded in 2019, according to Evercore. Some of the biggest private equity players in the space include Ardian, which raised an industry record $19 billion fund in June, and Coller Capital, which has this year been raising money for its latest flagship secondaries fund. Via its Vintage Funds unit, Goldman has invested more than $38 billion in secondaries deals.While the virus spurred GP-led exits to account for a record 41% of the secondaries market in the first half of this year, their volumes plummeted in line with industry activity. The number of all types of completed sales by private equity firms fell to the lowest in five years in the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.US private equity firm GCM Grosvenor last month said it expects GP-led deals to return to record volumes in the next couple of years as pent-up demand and less transactions in underlying portfolios send firms into the secondary market.But as a portion of the wider market, this year could prove the strategy's most popular yet. The deals are on track to make up 50% of all secondaries transactions by year-end, compared with 33% in 2019, said Nigel Dawn, global head of private equity advisory at Evercore, which advises on the transactions."Managers are saying 'we need more time'," said Dawn.

With Sanchez away at a ceremony in Barcelona with King Felipe VI, the cabinet meeting was to be chaired by Carmen Calvo, one of his deputies.
 "We have been continually reaching out to the region to deal with the situation to ensure that these measures are kept in place in order to contain the pandemic in Madrid," Calvo said ahead of the meeting.
 "We have only one objective: to protect Madrid.. If the community cannot do it, we will."
 \- Call for responsibility -
 Despite opposing the partial lockdown of the capital, mainly on economic grounds, Diaz Ayuso urged residents to stay within city limits, especially over the forthcoming three-day weekend for Spain's National Day on October 12.
 "We remain in a situation where incidence of the virus remains very, very high," national emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon warned on Thursday, urging people to act responsibly.
 "If people go to their second residence in the mountains, or go on holiday even within the region, it implies risk."
 Meanwhile, a group of scientific and medical organisations representing 170,000 professionals published a letter online pleading for an end to the political infighting.
 "You must accept, once and for all, that to deal with the pandemic, key decisions must be based on the best-available scientific evidence and completely disconnected from the ongoing political confrontation," it said.
 By late morning the petition, which was published on change.org, had been signed by nearly 100,000 people.
 The court refused to ratify the restrictions on grounds they were imposed by the central government and not by the regional authorities.
 The infection rate in the region of Madrid currently stands at 564 cases per 100,000 people, compared with just 257 in the rest of Spain, which is the highest in the European Union.

Many men have lived through the last few months in their pyjamas. But now that cooler days lie ahead, work-from-home / stay-at-home attire will transition to warmer track pants, sweatshirts and hoodies. Dressing gown, anyone?I can almost see the blank looks of younger readers, who've likely never encountered this garment, and the derisive expressions of older ones, who know of it, but as a quaint relic from the past.At one time, though, the dressing gown was what dapper gentlemen wore at home. In Hindi movies, it was closely identified with screen fathers -- the well-dressed, well-off dads wore it with style, often while standing at the top of a grand staircase, sometimes with a cigar or pipe in hand. Typically, it was a robe with broad lapels, fastened at the waist with a sash. It was made of thick silky-shiny fabric (lightly padded for warmth, I think), and often had a self- coloured pattern. It was introduced to India by the British and adopted by rich upper-class Indian men in an attempt to reflect sophistication and status. And that's how it was presented in Hindi movies. It imparted an air of gravitas, especially if the pater familias was busy forbidding weddings or turning unwanted, impecunious suitors away from the house.Dressing gown sightings in Hindi movies are far too numerous to enumerate, but I have a few favourites, classic scenes where the garment held centrestage.Top of the list are two scenes in Awara (1951) starring Prithviraj Kapoor and Nargis. Kapoor plays the wealthy, imposing Judge Raghunath; Nargis is his ward, Rita. Both scenes are set at the dining table. In the first, Rita helps the judge into a luxurious-looking patterned dressing gown, chiding him because it's getting late for his dinner. They then take their places at either end of a long dining table, a bearer standing at attention near the judge. Excitedly she tells him she's met an old school friend, Raj, after 12 years. The judge is immediately suspicious. Rita says she asked Raj what he did for a living and he said he was a thief. She clearly thinks it a big joke, but the judge isn't so sure. In the second scene, Rita is sneaking in after a rendezvous with Raj when Judge Raghunath spots her and calls to her. He's wearing the same dressing gown, smoking a cigarette and looking quite thunderous. They have a tense exchange that ends with Judge Raghunath stalking off in a temper, and stomping up a magnificent curved stairway. In both scenes, the dressing gown underlines perfectly his air of uncompromising patriarchal command.My second pick features Nasir Hussain in Mere Sanam (1965). Hussain was a wonderful actor who played father to a legion of heroes and heroines. Here, he has a trademark confrontation scene with Biswajeet, heir to his industrial empire. The setting is once again the dining room and Hussain, who plays a tycoon, is in a dark brown, slightly shiny dressing gown, with a muffler around his neck. When Biswajeet tells him that he's fallen in love with Neena (Asha Parekh) and wants to marry her, Mehra launches into a furious tirade about how a girl with no khandaan to speak of can never marry his heir!The final pick in my top three is from Andaz (1949), and features Murad and Nargis playing a rich businessman and his beloved daughter. This father is tender and indulgent. Murad doesn't approve of Neena's friendliness with young men, but he presents his point of view lovingly. It's good to remember that not all father figures in Hindi cinema were stern and unbending; many were doting and deeply sympathetic. His dressing gown was memorable too -- it had elaborate embroidery going all the way down the front and around the cuffs of the sleeves.Fathers don't wear dressing gowns in Hindi movies anymore and I'm guessing it would be hard to find one in the stores. Some fashions are destined to die, but that doesn't mean we can't remember them fondly.

Chandigarh For former India cricket all-rounder Renu Margrate, 45, life has come full circle. From a humble background in Amritsar, Margrate toiled hard to make ends meet and earn an India debut in 1995. Now, six months after she applied for the post of national selector, Margrate has been installed as one of the five-member panel for three years and would be paid Rs 25 lakh per annum as salary. The panel will be headed by former spinner Neetu David. An office superintendent with Indian Railways, Margrate, who played five Tests and 23 ODIs for India, replaced Shashi Gupta as selector from North Zone recently. "I'm grateful to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) appointed committee for choosing me for this job. It's amazing to be back to the sport after a decade in a different role. Our first job will be to make squads for the Women's T20 Challenge to be held in the United Arab Emirates. The tournament will provide a perfect platform to India domestic cricketers as Australians, Kiwis and English players will be busy in the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL)," said Margrate, who has played domestic cricket for Punjab and Indian Railways. 'CRICKET HAS GIVEN ME EVERYTHING' Going down the memory lane, Margrate remembers how her parents and brothers encouraged her to pursue cricket while they stayed in a small rented house near the Putli Ghar area in Amritsar. While her mother was a domestic help, her father would sell his paintings to earn a livelihood. "Those were difficult times. Yet they backed me and even sent me to a Jalandhar college so that I could pursue cricket passionately. We did not have money to buy spiked shoes. When I made my debut in 1995, they were elated. Sadly, they are no more but God has been kind," said Margrate, who was a middle-order bat and a medium-pace bowler. "After I got a job with Railways and played for India, things started looking up. Cricket has given me everything. I could improve my lifestyle and give back to my family. We shifted to a better house though in the same locality. I want to do my duty of being a selector with dignity and honesty like I conducted my career," says Margrate, who scored a match-winning 75 and also scalped six wickets during a match against Karnataka in the Rani Jhansi tournament in 1994. She smacked former India captain Shanta Rangaswamy in the match that helped her make her India ODI and Test debut against New Zealand in 1995. 'WOMEN'S CRICKET HAS TRANSFORMED' "Women's cricket has changed a lot. We never had money or specialised camps or designated trainers. We put up in dormitories and travelled in buses and trains. Since BCCI took over, the face of women's cricket changed in India. And the 2017 World Cup took the sport to another level. Now India cricketers have endorsements and BCCI gives central contracts," she said. "The Covid pandemic halted the game a bit but with IPL-13 taking place in the UAE, the smiles are back again. Hopefully, women matches will also have thrilling finishes. And we can find more Shafali Varmas from the tournament," said Margrate, who last played for India in the 2000 World Cup. The other selectors are Arati Vaidya, Mithu Mukherjee, V Kalpana and Neetu David as chief selector. 'NEED GOOD FAST BOWLERS' Margrate felt the need to have quality quick bowlers. "Jhulan (Goswami) doesn't play T20s, then there is Shikha Pandey. Other than them, we don't have many options. Once domestic cricket resumes, the selection panel would focus on scouting and grooming good fast bowlers," said Margrate. The BCCI contracted players along with other domestic cricketers have been asked to take their yo-yo tests to be eligible for the Women's T20 Challenge selection. It will have three teams and will be played from November 4 to 9.

Disputed redistricting reform on the ballot in Virginia - The Register Citizen

These pre-election issues would pale in comparison to a reprise of the court's 2000 Bush v. Gore case if the campaigns are fighting in court over the outcome in one or more states.
 There might be a 6-3 conservative majority by that point, if Barrett is confirmed. And she would join two other Trump-appointed justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, in potentially deciding whether the president who appointed her would get another four years in office. In Bush v. Gore, in which the court's five conservatives prevailed over its four liberals, no justices were voting on the political future of the president who appointed them.
 Not all the cases have electoral implications. But even those that don't are highly charged politically.
 In the fight over Trump's taxes, the justices could decide before Election Day whether to allow the immediate enforcement of a subpoena issued by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. or block it temporarily. The court in July rejected Trump's argument that he is effectively immune from the subpoena while serving as president, a decision Gorsuch and Kavanaugh joined.
 The 2020 census also has been to the court previously. In 2019, Roberts joined Ginsburg and the other liberals in a 5-4 decision that rejected the administration's effort to include a citizenship question on the census for the first time since 1950.
 Trump has since ordered the Census Bureau to provide him with a population count that excludes people who are in the country illegally so that their numbers would not be used for dividing the House of Representatives' 435 seats among the states, and the states' Electoral College vote, for the next 10 years.
 A lower court has blocked the Trump policy as illegal. The administration is appealing and asking for speedy resolution in time for the population report the president must submit to Congress in January.
 On an abortion-related issue, the court found a way Thursday to put off any definitive action for the time being.
 The court had failed to act for nearly a month on the administration's appeal to reinstate a requirement, temporarily suspended by lower court order because of the pandemic, that women make an in-person visit to obtain the abortion pull.
 The matter is the first abortion-related action before the court since Ginsburg died.
 On Thursday, the court said it would not act on the appeal for now, allowing women to continue to get the pill by mail and ordering the lower court to review its initial order.
 Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented, objecting that "there is no legally sound reason" for the court's refusal to rule.
 It is unclear whether the long period of inaction owed to Ginsburg's death, Barrett's nomination or some other factor.

Funds are moved through formal and informal (mainly hawala or hundis) channels. Pakistan’s geographical landscape and porous borders increase its vulnerability to terror financing and heightens the risks associated with cash smuggling.

We had recently returned home from Helena, from my last session that I served in the House of Representatives, and I was picking up my private law practice where I left it. During my time in private practice I represented farmers, ranchers, small businesses and neighbors, and handled just about every type of legal question imaginable. But after that shooting, Christie and I knew that if we wanted our kids to grow up feeling safe and secure, we had to do more to stop the drug epidemic and put violent criminals behind bars.

Many men have lived through the last few months in their pyjamas. But now that cooler days lie ahead, work-from-home / stay-at-home attire will transition to warmer track pants, sweatshirts and hoodies. Dressing gown, anyone?
 I can almost see the blank looks of younger readers, who've likely never encountered this garment, and the derisive expressions of older ones, who know of it, but as a quaint relic from the past.
 At one time, though, the dressing gown was what dapper gentlemen wore at home. In Hindi movies, it was closely identified with screen fathers -- the well- dressed, well-off dads wore it with style, often while standing at the top of a grand staircase, sometimes with a cigar or pipe in hand.
 Typically, it was a robe with broad lapels, fastened at the waist with a sash. It was made of thick silky-shiny fabric (lightly padded for warmth, I think), and often had a self-coloured pattern.
   
   
 It was introduced to India by the British and adopted by rich upper-class Indian men in an attempt to reflect sophistication and status. And that's how it was presented in Hindi movies. It imparted an air of gravitas, especially if the pater familias was busy forbidding weddings or turning unwanted, impecunious suitors away from the house.
 Dressing gown sightings in Hindi movies are far too numerous to enumerate, but I have a few favourites, classic scenes where the garment held centrestage.
 Top of the list are two scenes in Awara (1951) starring Prithviraj Kapoor and Nargis. Kapoor plays the wealthy, imposing Judge Raghunath; Nargis is his ward, Rita. Both scenes are set at the dining table. In the first, Rita helps the judge into a luxurious-looking patterned dressing gown, chiding him because it's getting late for his dinner. They then take their places at either end of a long dining table, a bearer standing at attention near the judge. Excitedly she tells him she's met an old school friend, Raj, after 12 years. The judge is immediately suspicious. Rita says she asked Raj what he did for a living and he said he was a thief. She clearly thinks it a big joke, but the judge isn't so sure.
 In the second scene, Rita is sneaking in after a rendezvous with Raj when Judge Raghunath spots her and calls to her. He's wearing the same dressing gown, smoking a cigarette and looking quite thunderous. They have a tense exchange that ends with Judge Raghunath stalking off in a temper, and stomping up a magnificent curved stairway. In both scenes, the dressing gown underlines perfectly his air of uncompromising patriarchal command.
 My second pick features Nasir Hussain in Mere Sanam (1965). Hussain was a wonderful actor who played father to a legion of heroes and heroines. Here, he has a trademark confrontation scene with Biswajeet, heir to his industrial empire. The setting is once again the dining room and Hussain, who plays a tycoon, is in a dark brown, slightly shiny dressing gown, with a muffler around his neck. When Biswajeet tells him that he's fallen in love with Neena (Asha Parekh) and wants to marry her, Mehra launches into a furious tirade about how a girl with no khandaan to speak of can never marry his heir!
 The final pick in my top three is from Andaz (1949), and features Murad and Nargis playing a rich businessman and his beloved daughter. This father is tender and indulgent. Murad doesn't approve of Neena's friendliness with young men, but he presents his point of view lovingly. It's good to remember that not all father figures in Hindi cinema were stern and unbending; many were doting and deeply sympathetic. His dressing gown was memorable too -- it had elaborate embroidery going all the way down the front and around the cuffs of the sleeves.
 Fathers don't wear dressing gowns in Hindi movies anymore and I'm guessing it would be hard to find one in the stores. Some fashions are destined to die, but that doesn't mean we can't remember them fondly.

In Virginia, the gerrymander goes all the way back to the first congressional elections, when then-Gov. Patrick Henry drew up a district to try to keep James Madison, father of the Constitution that Henry opposed, out of the House of Representatives.
 Madison, though, campaigned vigorously despite a chronic case of hemorrhoids, and beat James Monroe in a race featuring two future presidents.
 Now, Virginia voters are deciding whether to alter their state constitution to support redistricting reform that would take the once-every-10-year task of drawing maps out of legislators’ hands, at least to an extent, and give it to a bipartisan panel.
 The debate over the referendum comes one year after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allows even extreme partisan gerrymandering. But even though the issue has become a hot-button one nationally, the Virginia referendum is the only redistricting question on the ballot in the U.S. this year, said reform advocate Brian Cannon.
