Justin Bieber and his wife Hailey have reportedly decided to flee their Beverly Hills home in a bid to escape coronavirus chaos in the US.
 The married couple, who tied the knot in September, have distanced themselves back at his home country of Canada, it is claimed.
 The loved-up pair took a private jet home on Monday before Canada decided to close its borders to foreigners, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the killer virus, according to People.
 A source told the news outlet: “They plan on socially distancing themselves. In Canada, their home is very secluded and they are able to be out in nature still.”

Singer Natasha Hamilton said she was convinced she had coronavirus as she went into self-isolation.
 The Atomic Kitten member, 37, had been suffering with a fever, tummy aches, aches up her side, back and neck before she vomited.
 Mother-of-four Natasha concluded she could be suffering with coronavirus amid the pandemic plaguing the UK.
 Her symptoms emerged after she attended her auntie’s 50th crowded birthday party at the week-end with a group.
 Since then, she has been following precautions and self-isolating.
 The songwriter laid bare the “awful” details of her night which she spent “sleeping and in a lot of pain” when the fever got worse.
