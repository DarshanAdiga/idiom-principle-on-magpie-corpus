Bernal, Engels and Science, 10–12. With respect to Engels on the origins of life, Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin wrote that “dialectical materialism has focused [necessarily] mostly on some selected aspects of realty. At times we have emphasized the materiality of life against vitalism, as when Engels said that life was the motion of ‘albuminous bodies’ (i.e. proteins; now we might say macro-molecules). This seems to be in contradiction to our rejection of molecular reductionism, but simply reflects different moments in an ongoing debate where the main adversaries were first the vitalist emphasis on the discontinuity between the inorganic and living realms, and then the reductionist erasure of the real leaps of levels.” Richard Lewontin and Richard Levins, Biology Under the Influence (New York: Monthly Review Press, 2007), 103.

It is not only his statements that have created discomfort for Trinamool Congress but the very nature of his public meetings which has drawn everyone’s attention. There are no flags of ruling Trinamool Congress at these events or photographs or cut outs of Ms. Banerjee. These rallies have the Trinamool strongman supporters wearing t- shirts with a message _Amra Dadar Anugaami_ (We are supporters of Dada). Posters with the same message have come up in Purba Medinipur area over the past few weeks extending greetings to the people after Durga Puja. These developments come after months of his absence from administrative and political meetings of the Trinamool Congress.
 The message which Mr. Adhikari is trying to give is clearly that even without the banner of Trinamool Congress he has a support base of his own and can make or break elections for any combination. The Trinamool leader, however, is keeping his cards close to his chest. He has not made any remarks targeting the party leadership or said anything referring to Ms. Banerjee. He is also completely silent on the prospects of warming up to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or floating an outfit of his own.
 Mr. Adhikari, has been with Ms. Banerjee from the very start of the Trinamool Congress. He played a crucial and deciding role in the Nandigram movement when the struggle against forcible land acquisition by farmers in Purba Medinipur district rattled the Left Front government in 2007-08.
 He has been elected to Lok Sabha and now holds the portfolio of State’s Transport Department.
 His father Sisir Adhikari and brother Dibyendu Adhikari are Lok Sabha MPs from the district.
 The BJP leadership in the State has gone on record saying that he is welcome to join them. “As a youth leader I will urge him to join us and work for the people,” Soumitra Khan BJP MP and president of State’s Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha said. The BJP State unit president Dilip Ghosh and party national vice president Mukul Roy has also welcomed Mr Adhikari to the saffron party.
 His support is not limited only to Purba Medinipur district but also to parts of southwestern part of the State referred to Jangalmahal and other districts of south Bengal, where he assigned the responsibility to strengthen the party’s organisational base. Defections and factional feuds have emerged as the story of politics of West Bengal over the past several years and Mr. Adhikari’s next move is likely to an impact on the outcome of 2021 Assembly polls.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A requirement that Minnesota voters wear masks at the polls to help stop the spread of the coronavirus will remain in place on Election Day, after the U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to block the mandate while a lawsuit is being appealed. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who handles emergency requests from the federal appeals court that oversees Minnesota, denied the request for an emergency injunction from a group of voters that is trying to do away with the mask requirement. The voters sued Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other officials in August, arguing Walz’s mask mandate conflicts with a 1963 state law making it a misdemeanor for someone to conceal their identity with a mask. A federal judge denied their request to block the mandate, and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did the same. The plaintiffs, including Minnesota Voters Alliance and five conservative activists, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to issue an emergency ruling last week. They have argued that the requirement to wear a mask in public places or face criminal prosecution violates the First Amendment. Minnesota’s mandate requiring masks at all indoor businesses and indoor public settings applies to polling places, but a person will not be denied the right to vote if they do not have a mask. Under guidelines from the secretary of state, a voter without a mask will be asked to put one on and offered a mask if they do not have one. If they refuse, they will be offered curbside voting. If the voter refuses all of those options, they will still be given a ballot and allowed to vote, but their name will be recorded as being in violation of the governor’s mask mandate and they could end up being convicted of a petty misdemeanor and fined up to $100.

One responsibility of a film critic is to let prospective viewers know that even if a movie is being strongly recommended, it's imperative to point out that some of its contents could be upsetting. In the case of "Let Him Go," an adaptation of the 2013 novel by Larry Watson, my warning is that it's a story filled with unsettling tension, harrowing plot turns, and instances of almost unspeakable violence.      Now, before anyone decides this is not a film they want to see, let me dial that back. Yes, there is violence, of both the emotional and physical sort. But there's no outright gore, it's not gratuitous, and every bit of it serves to help define characters, to delineate the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Note: The nice folks are outnumbered by those who would do them harm.      Yet the film has a gentle beginning. It's the early 1960s. A young man, James, is in a corral, working with his horse. James and his wife Lorna (Kayli Carter) and new baby Jimmy soon get together for breakfast with his parents, George and Margaret (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) in the Montana farmhouse the family has called home for years. There's a slight hint that Lorna thinks Margaret is getting too attached to little Jimmy, otherwise all is well.      But just minutes in, tragedy strikes. James is killed when he's thrown by his horse. The film jumps ahead a few years, Lorna is marrying a fellow named Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain), and moving into town, and Margaret is unhappy that 3-year-old Jimmy won't be around the house anymore.      She's much more than unhappy when, a short time later, in town on errands, she sees, from afar, Donnie slap Jimmy, then slap Lorna. Soon after, paying a visit to Lorna to find out what's going on, Margaret discovers that all three of them have left town, without a goodbye, to live with Donnie's family in North Dakota.      What's a doting, strong-willed grandma to do? In this film of wildly shifting moods and unexpected turns of plot, she makes a snap decision. She will go to North Dakota, find the Weboy family, and bring her grandson back home, where it's safe. That she doesn't immediately tell George - a retired lawman, by the way - of her plan doesn't surprise him. After decades of marriage, he's well aware of Margaret's tendency to make up her mind on something, then follow through. They hop in their Chevy station wagon - in which she conveniently forgets to tell him she's packed his old six-shooter - and begin their long drive.      What unfolds is a story focusing on love of family, in all of its many forms. They go looking for the Weboy family - which some folks they meet choose to call the Weboy clan - and get, among other veiled warnings, a suggestion that they are not people to mess with.      The road trip also reveals that George and Margaret have had their own ups and downs, but love each other mightily and, despite his initial doubts about what they're doing - "Do you really think Lorna is just going to hand him over?" he asks - it's clear that they're in this thing together.      Turns out it's not Lorna they should be worried about. A meeting with ever- smiling Bill Weboy (Jeffrey Donovan), a cousin of Donnie, results in the film taking on an aura of menace. Their arrival at the isolated Weboy farm - where they've, to their amazement, been expected, results in an introduction to Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville), the smoking, drinking, chattering tough customer of a matriarch, who is off puttingly frightening. When her brood of big lug sons arrive at the dinner table, things get really uncomfortable for our out-of-their-element protagonists.      It's from here on that it all shifts from being tense to becoming almost unbearably unnerving, and is where the violence starts to rear its head. Kudos to everyone involved for across the board terrific performances, and for creating a film that, despite what they're being shown, will not let viewers avert their eyes. The conclusion will earn different opinions from different people, but all will undoubtedly admit they've gone through a riveting experience.      "Let Him Go" opens in theaters on Nov. 6.

Over time, Cuarón would pay a price for his principled stance on the “Mexican Question.” However, for several more years, Cuarón remained in the Party, working tirelessly to elect Henry Wallace, who ran for president under the Independent Progressive Party banner in 1948. Operating under the banner “Amigos de Wallace,” Wallace and his comrades mobilized working-class Mexican Americans in Los Angeles. Despite holding a huge rally in east Los Angeles and inspiring people all over the nation, Wallace received just 2.4 percent of the popular vote. Shortly thereafter, Cuarón became involved with the Mexican American National Association, which maintained very close ties to the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers. The International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers did not purge its radical members as part of the McCarthyite Red Scare in the late 1940s; indeed, the union collaborated with Hollywood 10 figures such as Herbert Biberman and Paul Jarrico to make the iconic film _Salt of the Earth_. Cuarón appeared in the blacklisted film as an extra. Finally, in the early 1950s, Cuarón participated in the Los Angeles Committee for the Protection for the Foreign Born that emerged after the antiradical, anti-immigrant McCarran-Walter Act was passed. Cuarón also continued to press the Communist Party to take a more assertive approach on the Mexican question, but after Nikita Khrushchev’s shocking revelations regarding Joseph Stalin’s abuses in 1956 and continued conflicts with Party officials in the late 1950s, Cuarón effectively drifted away from the Party.4
