The negative supply shock caused by factory closures is transmitted via supply chains to downstream sectors around the world, including in countries not currently experiencing a major COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, the pandemic is causing incomes and demand to contract, which affects upstream sectors everywhere. The resulting decline in business income and confidence can cause a downward spiral in demand for products and services. To forestall self- fulfilling recessionary expectations, governments must quickly roll out emergency programmes that may include the temporary suspension of tax and interest payments, financial support and guaranteed health benefits to workers, and financial assistance to banks.

FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak will force Kentucky lawmakers to scale back spending plans, House Speaker David Osborne said Thursday in forecasting an austere state budget. Proposed pay raises for teachers and state employees are now unlikely, he told reporters. Increases in the state's main funding formula for K-12 schools, known as SEEK, are in jeopardy, “There are a lot of things we know that we’re not going to be able to accommodate right now,” Osborne said. “So we’ll make this as thoughtful a budget as possible but at the same time it’s going to be pretty austere.” Lawmakers are bracing for a sharp downturn in state tax collections as many Kentucky businesses closed and others scaled back operations because of efforts to curb the virus's spread. Layoffs caused filings for unemployment benefits to skyrocket last week. “We are seeing a huge, grinding halt to our economy right now,” the speaker said. House and Senate budget negotiators are crafting a final version of a new two-year state budget that will take effect July 1. Lawmakers hope to vote on it next week as part of an abbreviated schedule for the rest of this year's session due to the virus outbreak. The GOP-led legislature would reconvene in mid-April to vote on any vetoes by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear before ending the session. The spending plan presented by Beshear in January, and the version passed by the House in early March, were based on revenue forecasts made in late 2019. Reflecting the new economic uncertainties, the Senate spending version passed recently includes “bumpers” that would stop certain spending increases if state revenues fall short of projections. Beshear campaigned last year on giving teachers a $2,000 salary boost and...

Yemens warring parties welcomed a U.N. call for an immediate truce on Thursday as the country entered its sixth year of a conflict that has unleashed a humanitarian crisis, rendering it more vulnerable to any coronavirus outbreak.In response, the United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths said he would call the parties to a meeting to put their words into action. A Saudi-led military coalition said late on Wednesday that it backed the Yemeni governments acceptance of the U.N. appeal. Their foe, the Iran- aligned Houthi movement, welcomed that stance but said it wants to see implementation on the ground.The U.S. Agency for International Development USAID meanwhile said it had started to reduce aid to areas controlled by the Houthis, on concerns the group hinders the delivery of assistance, a spokesperson told Reuters. The new coronavirus has yet to be documented in the impoverished Arabian peninsula nation where conflict has killed more than 100,000 and left millions on the brink of starvation.Following his call for a global ceasefire to focus on combating the pandemic, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday urged Yemens parties to end hostilities and restart peace talks last held in December 2018. The Sunni Muslim coalition, which intervened in Yemen in March 2015, supports efforts for a ceasefire, de- escalation, confidence-building measures and work to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement.The coalitions announcement ... is welcome. We are waiting for it to be applied practically, a senior Houthi official, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, wrote on Twitter late on Wednesday. Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis launched back-channel talks late last year. But there has been a recent spike in violence that threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities.We have a global coronavirus pandemic threatening to overwhelm an already broken health care system, said Tamuna Sabadze, country director at the International Rescue Committee, adding that Yemen was already battling a large cholera outbreak. Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthis ousted the government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The group still controls most major urban centres despite years of war.Millions are dependent on humanitarian aid in Yemen, but aid agencies in recent months have increasingly complained of interference and obstruction from Houthi authorities and threatened to scale down aid if conditions did not improve. The Houthis have failed to demonstrate sufficient progress towards ending unacceptable interference in these operations, the USAID spokesperson said, adding that it would continue to support the most urgent life-saving assistance.The coronavirus crisis demonstrates now more than ever the need for our partners to be able to deliver aid to those who need it most without interference or delay. Aid agency Oxfam warned that USAIDs approach would endanger an effective coronavirus response, leaving Yemen uniquely vulnerable to the most deadly pandemic in generations, it said in a statement.BAHAI RELEASES The head of the Houthi political office said on Wednesday the movement was open to de-escalation efforts with its foes, including prisoner releases.Mahdi al-Mashat, in comments carried by al-Masirah TV, then ordered the release of all Bahai faith members imprisoned by the Houthis, including Hamed bin Haydara whose death sentence was upheld earlier this week by a Sanaa court. The Bahai International Community welcomed the decision, which it said in a statement applied to six people wrongfully imprisoned for religious beliefs.It said the order should lead to the lifting of charges brought in 2018 against around 20 members of the faith, which regards its 19th-century founder as a prophet. Muslim countries, including Iran where the sect originated, consider it an heretical offshoot of Islam. Amnesty International said the move to release Bahai prisoners was a positive signal, especially in light of the coronavirus.We reiterate our call on all parties to the conflict to immediately and unconditionally release all those imprisoned solely for their peaceful activism, expression or political views, Amnesty Middle East Research Director Lynn Maalouf said.

Now that spring has arrived, delightful thoughts come to mind as I think of the magnificent plants that illuminate the garden. I love large shrubs that take center stage but I also adore those early perennials and minor bulbs that brighten smaller spaces. These are ones that are not grown as often, those rarer jewels that need to be lauded. I do not have as many as I would like but some of those that I do grow, I want to sing their praises.      One of the first to break the ground is Ranunculus ficaria "Brazen Hussy," a plant I first saw when visiting a garden in eastern Virginia. This deer- resistant spring perennial emerges with glossy dark burgundy foliage that contrasts well with the cheerful daffodil-yellow flowers. The stark contrast between the foliage and the flowers sets this plant apart and makes it stand out from a distance. I have had it for about 10 years and it comes back each February like clockwork and then it disappears, as the temperatures get warmer. I have read it is invasive but I still have the two plants that I purchased from Plants Delights and it is not invasive where I have them growing.      Bloodroot, (Sanguinaria) is a charming woodland plant that emerges and quickly shows off white flowers that stand out against the brown leaf litter. I also am attracted to the shape of the leaves and find them to be quite attractive and interesting. The leaves grow larger as the summer progresses, sporting deeply cut lobes that are quite eye-catching. This is a North American woodland perennial that is called bloodroot because it has a red sap that oozes from the roots when cut. Native American basket makers used the sap as a source of red dye. However, they did not use it as face paint because it is toxic if rubbed onto the skin.      Many of my gardening friends grow Virginia Bluebells, (Mertensia virginica), a cherished native that delights us in spring with nodding clusters of pink buds that open to sky blue flowers. These charming bell-shaped flowers have cool, soft green foliage making a beautiful display in a shaded area of the garden. You need to enjoy them quickly because as the flowers fade, so does the foliage and, before you know it, they disappear and go dormant until the following spring.      Brunnera has also become a favorite of mine for the shade garden. This trouble-free plant has dainty blue flowers that resemble forget-me-nots. The flowers stand high above the foliage on thin stems that sway in a gentle breeze. The one I grow is called Brunnera "Jack Frost" and was chosen the perennial of the year in 2012 by the Perennial Plant Association. This hardy plant is grown not only for the flowers but also for the veined heart-shaped leaves that are green and white and, if it does not get too hot and dry, they look pretty all summer long. My husband thinks these leaves are caladiums leaves in the summer, a plant he wants me to grow. I do not tell him that those variegated showy leaves are not what he thinks. What he does not know will not hurt him.      Phlox divaricata, a perennial with delightful blue or white flowers, is another woodland native which forms mats of foliage with stems that typically reach 12 inches tall. My friend Pat Burton introduced me to this plant and told me to be sure and purchase the variety called "Blue Moon." It is a lovely native phlox groundcover featuring clouds of rich violet-blue blooms that float above green foliage. It has a slight fragrance to wake up one's senses, and it flowers in March and April where I live. It is a perfect addition to a rock garden or any shady spot where it can slowly naturalize. I have it by a stream and I am hoping that one day, the mats will become large enough that they drape over the rocks lining the stream.      If you like to plant bulbs or corms, you should try planting Erythronium, which is also called Trout Lilies or Dogtooth Violet. I grow one called "Pagoda" which bears graceful sulfur yellow flowers with a reddish-brown ring at the center. The flower is shaped like a tiny lily and the leaves are a beautiful bright green. I grow mine in part shade with rich woodsy soil. These deer and rodent resistant plants only last for a short time because, by late May, the Dogtooth Lilies have gone dormant for the summer.   Think about planting some to brighten up a small space where you want a little something extra. Many of them are called spring ephemerals because the plants last only a brief time. They bloom and die back and go dormant and disappear from view shortly after they stop flowering. I enjoy them and I hope I always have a place for a few in the garden. These early charmers are a joy to grow.      Betty Montgomery is a master gardener and author of "Hydrangeas: How To Grow, Cultivate & Enjoy," and "A Four-Season Southern Garden."

BlackRock, Credit Suisse and some other big banks reckon it is time to get back into equities after markets rallied this week following massive government and central bank stimulus packages to fight fallout from the coronavirus crisis. The 2 trillion U.S. fiscal stimulus package proceeding through Congress has triggered big gains in global stocks, sending investors rushing to dust-off models from the 2008 financial crisis to gauge the right time to buy.The Dow finished up 21 from its Monday low on Thursday, establishing it in a bull market, according to a widely used definition. It was the indexs strongest three-day percentage increase since 1931. World stocks have risen nearly 8 so far this week and were on track for their best weekly gain since December 2011. They have recouped more than 5 trillion in the past two days.Spotting an inflection point is not easy when the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly across Europe and the United States, but BlackRock and Credit Suisse said on Thursday they had turned slightly bullish on risk assets. The unprecedented actions represent the type of decisive policy response we have been calling for and set the scene for an eventual economic recovery, Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, said on Thursday.The worlds top asset manager said the market sell- off had created significant value for long-term investors and told clients it now favoured rebalancing into risk assets. Within the equity space, BlackRock said it preferred U.S. markets due to the strength of Washingtons policy response and the quality of the market.Many investors are still trying to work out the right time to re-enter markets. At least one model from JPMorgan shows the correct time would be now, based on a view that a recession would be shortlived. Bearishness remains in many corners of the market, as uncertainty continues to swirl around the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic and its potentially massive economic fallout.Some 52 of investors surveyed in a American Association of Individual Investors poll had a bearish view on the U.S. stock market, the highest percentage since early 2009. There also remains little clarity on companies earnings in the wake of coronavirus-led slowdowns in business activity, analysts at Yardeni Research said in a note.With the U.S. and global economies falling into a severe recession, analysts will need to lower nearly all of their revenues and earnings estimates in the coming weeks and months, the report said. Others, however, said it is better to act early than miss a potential rally.Credit Suisse, which is positive on developed market equities, said There is merit in being an early mover rather than wait until a market bottom has become apparent for all. The Swiss bank said that over a six- to 12-month horizon, equities offered attractive value.Notably, U.S. and European stock valuations based on a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio now have dipped well below historical averages, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, encouraged clients to position for the possibility of a more durable recovery by purchasing shares of oversold U.S. technology and communications companies.The positive momentum could continue in the days ahead if we see signs that government efforts to contain the virus are starting to pay off, the firm said in a note to investors. Others are looking beyond the movements of the broader market indexes.Individual stocks have seen far more downside than the wider averages indicate, wrote Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro for Fidelity Management Research Company. To say that the stock market is now extremely oversold would be the understatement of the year, he said.A gauge of SP 500 stocks hitting new highs versus those hitting new lows last week produced the third lowest reading of that measure in history, eclipsed only by markets during the 2008 financial crisis and in the Great Depression, the firms analysis showed. With the exception of the 1930s, most of the downside in past sell-offs had been complete by the time markets became this extreme, Timmer wrote.Some lower lows may well lie ahead in the coming weeks, but my expectation based on the above is that the momentum of the decline is probably peaking, he said.

Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James shed light on a variety of topics facing the NBA should it attempt to resume the 2019-20 season later this year. Appearing on the Road Trippin podcast, James expressed concerns for NBA players competing against someone who was diagnosed with the coronavirus.So what happens when a guy who is tested positive for corona and youre out there on the floor with him and its a loose ball James said on the 51-minute podcast, which was hosted by former Cleveland Cavaliers teammates Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye as well as current Lakers studio host Allie Clifton. James also expressed displeasure with the notion of playing games without fans, which likely would be the NBAs first step back to action since it suspended the season earlier this month.What is the word sport without fan the four-time NBA MVP asked. Theres no excitement. Theres no crying. Theres no joy. Theres no back-and-forth. Theres no rhyme or reason that you want to go on the road and just dethrone the home team because of their fans and vice versa. ... Thats what also brings out the competitive side of the players to know that youre going on the road in a hostile environment and yes, youre playing against that opponent in front of you, but you really want to kick the fans backside too.While James provided tongue-in-cheek responses to how he will handle physical interaction with the fans -- I aint high-fiving nobody for the rest of my life after this expletive -- he appeared to take a more direct tone when discussing the idea of starting the NBA playoffs upon return to action. One thing you cant just do is go straight to the playoffs, James said. Because it discredits the 60-plus games that guys had fighting for that position.

U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Thursday he has directed the federal Bureau of Prisons BOP to expand its use of home confinement for inmates in appropriate cases, as the coronavirus has continued to spread in the federal prison system. A total of six inmates and four prison staffers have tested positive for COVID-19, Barr said, adding that several federal facilities including two in New York City are now on lockdown as a result.The First Step Act, signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in late 2018, expanded the BOPs powers to maximize the amount of time that lower- risk inmates can spend in home confinement, when possible. Ive asked and issued a memorandum just today to the Bureau of Prisons to increase the use of home confinement, Barr told reporters during what he said was the departments first virtual press conference in order to practice social-distancing.One of the things we have to assess is whether that individual ... will be more safe in the particular circumstance in which they are going to find themselves. And in many cases, that may not be the case. He added that any inmate released on home confinement will still face a 14-day quarantine before they leave prison.The plans by the Justice Department to increase the use of home confinement comes as criminal justice advocates and union officials representing prison workers have called on Barr to implement tougher measures to prevent the coronavirus from spreading throughout the federal prison system. Some local jails and prisons in states such as New Jersey, meanwhile, have taken more drastic steps by releasing low-risk inmates serving county jail sentences.The BOP has not signaled it would take such a step, though it has stepped up safeguards, including through the implementation of a policy requiring all new inmates to be quarantined for 14 days. In a statement, the Justice Collaborative, a non-profit criminal justice group, called Barrs memo a false promise that contains more red tape for inmates and will take too long for deserving prisoners to be released.The DOJs plan is far too slow to save lives, the group said, noting it would be better to fast-track the release of non-violent offenders who qualify based on age and pre-existing conditions. It added it is unclear why inmates would need to serve the 14-day quarantine behind bars if home confinement is an option.

 The coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China and has since enacted strict curfew and lockdown procedures.

The sharp rally in banking stocks, which rose 10-12 per cent, in the first half of Thursday's trade did not sustain fully as hopes of relief or bailout measures for the sector from the finance minister did not materialise. The minister though has kept the option open for more relief measures as and when needed, which suggests that some relaxation (from the Reserve Bank of India or RBI) on asset classification norms (critical for classification of non- performing assets or NPA) may come through for the sector. While hopes of some relief have been around for over 10 days, any further delay could prove costly for banks.

As seasons went by with no evidence that the show was being the least bit helpful for people's personal lives, perhaps the men and women looking for love were more...  _encouraged_ to take the plunge later on, with the help of a perfect Neil Lane diamond ring. Juan Pablo just happened to be the Bachelor after six straight seasons of proposals, hence the shock factor when he didn't want to commit.
 But Nikki would soon find out, after that so-promising relationship ended, that it was of course all for the best. And she's one of many who have benefited from the  _Bachelor_ bounce.

The first day, people would walk on their balconies, sing songs; the next day give a big round of applause to doctors; third day do this or that. This was something new for everybody. Especially for Italians; we are used to being out and about, filling up the squares, going out to restaurants, the streets filled with cars and scooters. Life. Having to be on lockdown was pretty shocking and that’s why the first week there were many violations of the decree that came out that didn’t allow us to go out. The second week, the week of the 16th, there were no more of those songs, those applauses. The mood of people changed. The numbers, especially in the north part of Italy, were going higher. The death of people, all those images that the whole world has seen. They were shocking to all of us. There were no more songs, applauses, banners, because it seemed there was no hope. It was a sign that we have to stay home. Personally, I took it as, ‘This isn’t going to end soon; I need to get used to this being the new way of living and learning.’

Wellington Phoenix footballer Tim Payne apologized, crying, after being caught driving a golf cart in Sydney after a drunken night, when he was supposedly in quarantine. The New Zealand midfielder and his compatriot goalkeeper Oliver Sail, passenger in the vehicle, risk very heavy penalties for this escapade in the night from Monday to Tuesday. The Wellington-based Phoenix were then in solitary confinement in Sydney hoping to play their A-League games if this championship, which brought together Australian and New Zealand teams, resumed behind closed doors. The worsening in Australia of the epidemic of the new coronavirus however reduced these hopes to zero and the Phoenix finally returned Tuesday to New Zealand.

These transactions, however, do hint at where the Cardinals were leaning for their bullpen as spring came to a sudden halt.
 Reyes, Cabrera, and Fernandez were all in the mix to win a relief role in the majors. Andrew Miller's uncertain availability for opening day gave Cabrera a longer look as a second or third lefty in the bullpen, even as he continued to get time as a starter. When or if that season begins for Class AAA Memphis, Cabrera, 23, is likely to be a starter, unless needed in relief.

Technical chart claims that AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. (AMN) would settle between $66.48/share to $72.8/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $56.92 mark, then the market for AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $53.68 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -7.8. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) —
 UFC light heavyweight champion Jon “Bones" Jones has been arrested on suspicion of DWI and other offenses after officers heard gunshots and found him in a parked car with a handgun and a half-empty bottle of liquor early Thursday, Albuquerque police said.
 The 32-year-old Jones was arrested on suspicion of aggravated DWI, negligent use of firearms, possession of an open container of alcohol and no proof of insurance for a vehicle, police said.
 Police said Jones was found in the driver's seat of a parked vehicle with the engine running about 1 a.m. Authorities said Jones showed signs of intoxication and a handgun and a half-empty bottle of liquor were in the vehicle.

 Within the urgency of a global pandemic, innovation and research will often help win the day. As the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc, bright minds are at work across numerous disciplines looking for ways to reduce the impact of COVID-19 today and the future pandemics of tomorrow.
   
 Some of those bright minds are here in West Texas. For example, technology developed at West Texas A&M; University originally intended to protect soldiers from anthrax has been repurposed to be deployed across the Canyon campus to protect door handles from viruses and bacteria.
   
 Doors are scheduled to soon receive Copper Clean stickers over handles and push plates, according to information from the Texas A&M; University System. These stickers, a highly engineered copper-alloy foil with adhesive backing, are a product developed by Engineering Dean Emily Hunt and a group of graduate engineering students working to commercialize patents obtained for WTAMU and the A&M; System.
   
 Combined with other standard infection control practices, the stickers will reduce germ-related impact on high-touch surfaces throughout campus. "The stickers are made with a copper-alloy that has been proven to kill 99.9 percent of harmful pathogens, like MSRA, staph, aureus and E. coli within two hours," Hunt said. Testing against other threats, including COVID-19, is scheduled to begin soon.
   
 Officials say copper has lone been known as an antimicrobial. The WTAMU team originally began looking at ways to apply it to high-touch surfaces four years ago. According to A&M;'s news release, Hunt began researching antimicrobial materials more than 10 years ago after receiving a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation to pursue ways of protecting soldiers and civilians from biological weapons.
   
 The Copper Clean stickers are made by an EPA-approved, American manufacturer with the first shipment just arriving and WTAMU being the first customer. However, Hunt indicated discussions are taking place with interested school districts across the state.
   
 Along a similar line, you might have seen our story recently about the decontamination wipe invented by a Texas Tech researcher. The three-layer nonwoven wipe, which cleans up toxic agents, also holds promise so far as cleaning up bodily fluids contaminated with the coronavirus.
   
 The technology, known as FiberTect, has an activated carbon core between absorbent top and bottom layers. As a wipe or mitt, researchers say it could be an important tool in clean-up efforts of settings conducive to transmission of the virus.
   
 It was invented by Seshadri Ramkumar, a professor of chemical countermeasures and advanced materials in the Texas Tech Department of Environmental Toxicology. He says the structure of the wipe has been effective in containing bodily fluids such as saliva and mucus through which the virus can be transmitted. Its activated carbon also absorbs particles transmitted in vapor phase through the air, according to our story.
   
 "It can be used to clean wet surfaces contaminated with bodily fluids," Ramkumar said. "Highly porous carbon in the structure can trap the vapors and aerosols in which microbes are contained. The wipe structure is flexible and can take the shape of the objects to be cleaned. The three-ply structure without glue helps this effective cleaning."
   
 We are fortunate to have great universities with outstanding researchers developing solutions locally that might ultimately benefit the world, especially in these uncertain, unpredictable times.
   
 The coronavirus threat is one that impacts everyone, and it is good to know that bright minds in West Texas are hard at work doing what they can to help win a battle that requires everyone's participation.
