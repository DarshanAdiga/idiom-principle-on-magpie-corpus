MARTINSBURG — One year after a fatal accident that took the life of a local daughter, sister, aunt, friend and Musselman High student, the driver — a now 19-year-old — was sentenced to three to 15 years in prison on Friday.


  Nicholas James Shackelford, of Thoreau Drive, Inwood, pleaded guilty in October to the felony charge of DUI causing death, the single count in the indictment, and admitted to driving under the influence on New Year’s Eve and flipping his vehicle with Kristen Barron, 18, and a senior at Musselman, in the passenger seat.


  Twenty-third Judicial Circuit Court Judge Steven Redding accepted the guilty plea, carrying with it a maximum prison sentence of three to 15 years and a $1,000-$3,000 fine.

"They have a hell of a D," said Fletcher, who ran for 102 yards on 19 carries. "They came pumped up. We had to come and finish."


  Still, American Heritage finished with fewer than 200 yards and Northwestern, ranked No. 15 by MaxPreps, had 210. A missed field goal and two red-zone interceptions left the Bulls with only three points.


  After the Patriots' touchdown drive, Northwestern quarterback Taron Dickens lost a fumble and star free safety James Williams, who is orally committed to the Miami Hurricanes, recovered. A field goal pushed American Heritage's lead to 9-3 and the Bulls answered with a march down the field.


  Running backs Saddiq Jackson and D'Shawn Trowers took turns carrying Northwestern and the Bulls got all the way down to the 13-yard line before linebacker Jaedan Kinlock intercepted Taron Dickens at the goal line. It was the second time American Heritage intercepted the Bulls quarterback in the red zone and it stopped Northwestern's best chance at staging a comeback.


  The Bulls final opportunity came with about eight minutes left in the game. A punt by Miami commit Kahlil Brantley backed up the Patriots at their 1-yard line and Murphy left with a cramp after sneaking for a few yards to start the drive. Star athlete Vinson Davis entered as the emergency quarterback and game plan changed entirely. He and Fletcher ran the read option, and they combined for four runs longer than 10 yards to eventually guide American Heritage into field-goal range to put away the victory.


  Surtain referred to it as redemption for the Patriots and it was finally theirs.


  "Going 11-2 is great for some schools, but not us. We hang banners around here, man, and we haven't been able to do that the last two years and our kids were ready for it," Surtain said. "We didn't want any other team. We wanted the West."

Rose has become a lonely but powerful voice: a longtime high school coach — one of the more successful in football-mad Alabama — who finds it ludicrous to be carrying on with prep sports in the midst of a devastating pandemic.


  He felt so strongly about it that he quit his coaching job at Russell County High, a school in the rural, eastern part of Alabama, not far from the Georgia line.


  "I put it all on the line, but I would do it all again," Rose said Friday when reached on his cell phone. "I couldn't sleep at night if I wasn't protecting my players, their families and my coaches."


  Rose is outraged that some 30,000 high school kids in Alabama — not to mention hundreds of thousands around the country — have continued to play football without the rigid testing protocols that colleges and the NFL were able to put in place.


  "We have zero testing policy in the whole state. None," Rose said "We were just guinea pigs out there."


  Russell County forfeited or called off its first five games because of COVID-19 issues. When it became apparent the Warriors would be cleared to take the field in Week 6, Rose gave up his job and its $29,000 annual stipend, though he remains at the school as the athletic director.


  The 54-year-old called it an "excruciating" decision given how much football has meant to him.


  In the late 1980s, Rose was an undersized offensive lineman who started on Pat Dye's last championship team at Auburn. He still remembers one especially brutal practice, but with a sense of gratitude in his voice, believing those challenges helped mold him into the man he is.


  "I lost 17 pounds," Rose recalled. "I needed four bags of IV fluids."


  Over the last three decades, he's built an enviable reputation leading the next generation of players. Rose has been the head coach at four schools, proudly noting that he's never been fired from a job. A career record of 175-82 made him the 24th winningest active coach in the state coming into this season, according to the Alabama High School Football Historical Society.


  But Rose's dedication to the game goes far beyond wins and losses.


  "I've missed two practices since I was 7 years old," he said. That was in 2010, when he was coaching at Smiths Station High. "My mother was dying. I drove to Huntsville to be with her after practicing on a Monday night. She died that night, so I spent two days burying her. Then I drove back and coached the game on Friday night."


  With his coaching career on hold, Rose has taken on an even higher calling. He considers it his spiritual duty to call out the decision by his state (and so many others) to carry on with Friday night lights as if everything was normal.


  "The Lord is telling me to say this," Rose related. "He showed me real quick that this was not something to be messed with."


  Unfortunately, too many others have taken a different tack, downplaying the threat of COVID-19 or, even worse, calling it nothing more than a hoax.

  Shackelford was also ejected from the vehicle and was airlifted to Inova Fairfax Hospital after sustaining serious injuries, WVSP said.


  While on scene, WVSP Trooper P. Butler learned from another trooper that a medic unit advised Shackelford may have been under the influence, court records said. A search warrant was obtained for his medical records, which allegedly show his blood alcohol content was a .102.


  Berkeley County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney John Lehman told the court at the plea hearing that witnesses advised during the investigation that Shackelford was drinking with them before getting behind the wheel. It is also said that he had consumed at least eight shots of Burnett’s vodka.


  Shackelford apologized Friday to the victim’s family and discussed his struggles with his decision to drive and why he did not die instead.


  “I need to live my life in a way to honor her,” he said during his statement, and stating he deserves whatever sentence was pronounced.


  In announcing the maximum sentence, Judge Redding discussed the elements used to determine a sentence, highlighting the “profound” grief of the victim’s family, the court’s belief he has not taken his alcohol recovery seriously and a reckless driving ticker just months before these events.


  Judge Redding ultimately denied the defense’s request for home incarceration or the imprisonment in the Anthony Correctional Center, a prison for youthful offenders. Before doing so, he said it would send the wrong message to the public to allow someone to drink, drive and kill somebody to stay in the comfort of their home.


  The three to 15 years indeterminate sentence means Shackelford will be eligible for parole after serving at least three years, although the parole board can decide never to grant parole during the maximum 15 years.

The Division of Emergency Management facilitates the system used to process resources requests and has no role in approving or denying the requests according to Lawrence Messina, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. DEM coordinates with the county emergency management agencies and DHHR.


  ”As with emergency response generally, the process begins locally: with potential assistance or resources from neighboring counties, and then regionally, and then from state-level agencies,” Messina said.


  The denied requests included asking for portable lights or temporary buildings and tents, assistance with traffic control or seeking guardsmen to help with testing support. The West Virginia National Guard pointed out that in many cases, they reach out to the organizations that have had a request denied helping them find the assistance they need some other way. In some cases, requests were denied by being put into the system wrong.


  As cases began to increase, Gov. Jim Justice ordered the National Guard to increase testing capacity. According to the National Guard, 42% of the state’s positive cases have occurred in the last 30 days.


  The National Guard has been on COVID-19 duty for more than 250 days since Justice first declared a state of preparedness on March 4. That turned into a state of emergency on March 17. There are 472 service members working on COVID-19 response as of Nov. 13, according to the National Guard, completing more than 2,614 assigned missions.


  Over the last nine months, the National Guard has distributed more than 19 million pieces of personal protective equipment a week, as well as manufacturing more than 220,000 face masks, gowns and face shields. The National Guard also assisted in ramping up testing, with 388 testing events being held between Oct. 30 and Nov. 13 resulting in more than 15,000 COVID-19 tests.


  As of this morning, 34 locations in 20 counties are offering free drive-thru testing. Another 45 locations in 25 counties offer weekly recurring test locations, many of which require appointments. Select Fruth and Walgreen's pharmacies in 37 counties also offer COVID-19 testing by appointment. Locations for testing can be found at coronavirus.wv.gov.


  Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, adjutant general of the National Guard, said Wednesday that the Guard also is working with senior living facilities and county emergency medical services to make sure they can also be tested.


  “A significant number of test lanes continue to go on across the state,” Hoyer said. “Over the past 24 hours, our Task Force Sustainment conducted 86 missions in 20 counties primarily focused on delivering additional testing capability to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and to our EMS counterparts to make sure they can test and stay safe, as well.”


  But even with all these efforts, that doesn’t mean that every request by county health departments can be fulfilled, especially with guardsmen and state health officials stretched to the maximum. That has resulted in some health departments having to be told no sometimes.


  On Oct. 26, the Berkeley County Health Department requested two guardsmen to assist with traffic control for its COVID-19 testing events Oct. 27 and Oct. 29 at Shenandoah Community Health in Martinsburg. The request was denied on Oct. 27, stating “guard unable to support.”


  On Oct. 23, the Berkeley County Health Department asked for nurses to help administer flu shots due to the department’s nursing staff being quarantined due to COVID-19 exposure. The State Emergency Operations Center forwarded the request to leadership for approval, but the request was denied with no reason given.


  Another request, submitted by the Department of Health and Human Resource’s Center for Threat Preparedness on behalf of the Fayette County Health Department, requested two guardsmen for administrative and clerical support for a free testing event scheduled for Oct. 27 in Mt. Hope. The request was denied by the guard’s Task Force CRE, which stated it was “unable to support this mission at this time.”


  On Oct. 19, the Mingo County Health Department requested National Guard support at various drive-thru testing sites between Oct. 24 and Oct. 30, including two people to swab, two support personnel, along with tents, tables, and chairs. Task Force CRE said it could not provide the equipment, but it was able to provide the guardsmen.

  The Hawks were one of the teams who entered free agency with considerable cap space, and have been looking for veteran talent to add to the group that includes Trae Young and Kevin Huerter.


  Gallinari, a 32-year-old Italian, has also played with the Knicks, Nuggets and Los Angeles Clippers. He was originally the sixth overall pick in the 2008 draft by New York.


  BROOKLYN


  Joe Harris has agreed to re-sign with the Nets, keeping one of the NBA's best shooters in Brooklyn.


  The Nets checked off what general manager Sean Marks called their biggest priority in free agency on Friday night by agreeing to a deal with the swingman.


  Priority Sports, which represents Harris, announced the deal on Twitter. ESPN reported that Harris would get $75 million over four years.


  Harris finished his fourth season in Brooklyn by averaging a career-best 14.5 points in 69 games in 2019-20.


  DALLAS


  The Mavericks and Trey Burke have agreed on a $10 million, three-year contract to bring the guard back after he played well in the NBA bubble.


  Burke originally joined Dallas in the trade with New York headlined by Kristaps Porzingis in early 2019. The Mavericks didn't re-sign Burke before last season, and he ended up in Philadelphia.


  The 76ers waived Burke in February before the coronavirus shutdown, and Dallas signed him before the restart after center Willie Cauley-Stein opted out of the finish to the season.


  DENVER


  The last time Facundo Campazzo and Nikola Jokic shared a court in a real game together was during last year's Basketball World Cup in China. Campazzo was dazzling and Argentina prevailed, ending the championship hopes for Jokic and Serbia.


  Soon, they'll be teammates in another title quest.


  Campazzo agreed to a two-year deal with the Denver Nuggets on Friday's opening day of free agency, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contract remains unfinished until at least Sunday, when the NBA moratorium on new signings will be lifted.


  The New York Times first reported the agreement between Campazzo and the Nuggets.


  The 5-foot-10 Campazzo has played in the Olympics twice, the Basketball World Cup twice, has a pair of EuroLeague championships and is known for passes that are spectacular. And now, he's decided it's time to try the NBA with a Denver team that rallied from 3-1 playoff deficits twice last season to make it to the Western Conference finals -- where they fell to the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers.


  DETROIT


  Jerami Grant is headed to Detroit on a three-year, $60 million deal, player representative Mike Kneisley of The Neustadt Group said.


  Grant is coming off a season where he averaged 12.0 points for Denver, which wanted him back.


  The Pistons received commitments Friday night from centers Mason Plumlee and Jahlil Okafor, people familiar with those deals told AP. ESPN, which first reported the Plumlee agreement, said he would sign a three-year deal for $25 million.


  Plumlee later posted a thank-you letter to Denver fans on his Twitter account, saying he "has no doubt" that big things await the Nuggets. He also said he's excited to join the Pistons, calling them "one of the league's most storied franchises."


  L.A. CLIPPERS


  Marcus Morris is staying with the Clippers on a four-year deal, a person with knowledge told AP. ESPN, which first reported the agreement, said it was a $64 million contract.


  Morris averaged 16.7 points last season, starting the season in New York before getting traded to the Clippers.


  "Run it back!" Morris tweeted.


  Also Friday, Patrick Patterson will return on a one-year contract, AP was told. Patterson averaged 4.9 points last season for the Clippers. ESPN first reported the Clippers' agreement with Patterson.


  L.A. LAKERS


  The defending NBA champions are adding Montrezl Harrell as a free agent from the Clippers, a person with knowledge of the deal told AP.


  That move, when finalized, will give the Lakers the top two finishers in last season's Sixth Man of the Year voting. Harrell won the award; Dennis Schroder, who was acquired by the Lakers in a trade with Oklahoma City earlier this week, was second.


  MIAMI


  The Heat got quick agreements from point guard Goran Dragic and center Meyers Leonard on two-year deals, the second year in both cases being team options. Dragic will make about $18 million next season, Leonard about $9 million.


  "I simply appreciate that they care about the little things," Leonard said.


  Dragic flew back to Miami from his native Slovenia on Friday and intends to sign his new contract quickly. He said the fact that the Heat will have much of its roster back from a year ago, when the team won the Eastern Conference title, was particularly important to him.


  "This is a family here," Dragic said. "We know we have a good team. We know we have chemistry. We have unfinished business."


  MINNESOTA


  The Timberwolves reached a $60 million agreement with restricted free agent shooting guard Malik Beasley that's for three years plus a team option for a fourth year, a person with knowledge of the deal confirmed to AP.


  Beasley, who was acquired from the Denver Nuggets in a four-team trade in February, was charged last month with drug possession and threats of violence in Hennepin County District Court, after allegedly aiming a rifle at a family in their vehicle outside his Minnesota home where a large amount of marijuana and other guns were seized during a police search.


  Beasley averaged 20.7 points in 14 games after arriving in Minnesota.


  The Timberwolves also finalized and confirmed three draft-night trades, including the deal with Oklahoma City reuniting them with point guard Ricky Rubio.


  NEW YORK


  Alec Burks is the first free agent addition under Knicks President Leon Rose.


  The swingman agreed to a $6 million, one-year deal, first reported by ESPN and confirmed by his agent.


  Burks split last season between Golden State and Philadelphia, averaging a career-best 15 points.


  The Knicks went into free agency with about $35 million to spend after waiving a number of veterans Thursday.


  ORLANDO


  A person with knowledge of the negotiations said the Magic and guard Dwayne Bacon agreed on a one-year deal for about $2.5 million this coming season. The Magic hold a team option for 2021-22, the person who spoke to AP said.


  Bacon is a Central Florida native, born in Lakeland, not far from Orlando. He played college ball at Florida State and spent his first three pro seasons in Charlotte. Steve Clifford, now the Magic coach, was his coach there in his rookie year.


  PHILADELPHIA


  Veteran center Dwight Howard is going to join the 76ers on a one-year deal worth the veteran's minimum of $2.6 million, agent Charles Briscoe told AP.


  Howard heads to Philadelphia after helping the Los Angeles Lakers win this past season's NBA title.


  PORTLAND


  Derrick Jones Jr., the league's reigning Slam Dunk champion, agreed to a two- year deal with the Trail Blazers. The Athletic first reported the agreement, which a person with knowledge later confirmed to AP.


  Jones Jr. was a major part of Miami's rotation for the last two seasons, and averaged a career-best 8.5 points per game for the Heat this past year.

  Jordan Clarkson is staying and Derrick Favors is coming back, according to people with direct knowledge of the transactions.


  Clarkson agreed to a four-year, $52 million deal; he averaged 15.6 points in 42 games after getting traded to Utah last December. And Favors -- a post player who spent most of his NBA career in Utah before playing with New Orleans last season -- returned on a deal that will pay him nearly $30 million for three seasons.

Ese cuadernillo dedica cuatro páginas a un artículo de Carlos Sánchez Berzaín titulado “Dictaduras usan coronavirus para sostenerse, conspirar y lucrar”, en donde acusa a los presidentes de Cuba, Venezuela y Nicaragua “de aprovechar la pandemia para fortalecer sus regímenes de facto, conspirar para derrocar democracias, lucrarse con la ayuda internacional, el tráfico de médicos esclavos e incrementar el narcotráfico”. Esa visión es incorrecta y prejuicida. Es increíble que ese irrespeto a tres naciones que tienen relaciones con República Dominicana, sea permitido que se le enseñe a nuestros estudiantes. La corriente Juan Pablo de Duarte de la ADP, al pedir que sea eliminado ese cuadernillo afirma que “el MINERD debe evitar las imposiciones carentes de rigor científico como es evidente en los indicados textos, cuyos autores actúan más como propagandistas, que como cientistas sociales que no aportan en la formación de sujetos críticos y libres de pensamiento”.

  Jones recalled sitting in his room in March, thinking there wouldn’t even be a season. And he pointed out other states indeed have not been playing.


  “It was crazy,” Jones said. “I look at it, every game was a blessing.


  “We had an opportunity. … We just lost to a really good Zionsville team. At the end of the day, we controlled our own destiny, and we lost. There’s really not much more you can ask for.”

With COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths rapidly rising in our county, it is imperative that we all social distance and wear a mask.


  I have had the pleasure of being a physician in Cabool for more than three decades, but unfortunately, this is one of the strangest diseases that I have ever seen.


  I have had previously healthy 60-year old patients die, and I have had hospitalized 90-year old patients get better and go home within 24-hours.


  There does appear to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Recently two drug manufacturers have come out with COVID-19 vaccines, each of which were more than 90 percent effective on more than 40,000 volunteers.


  So until the pandemic runs its course or everyone has been vaccinated, please be courteous to others. Wear a mask and practice social distancing, especially when indoors.

The Clippers had long coveted Morris before trading for him at the deadline in February. It took him some time to adjust to a less substantive offensive role in L.A, where he’s playing beside All-Stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, but the 6-foot-8 forward found a rhythm in the playoffs, when he was the Clippers’ fourth-highest playoff scorer. He averaged 11.8 points per game on 50.5 percent shooting, including making 47.5 percent of the 4.5 3-pointers he attempted per game.
