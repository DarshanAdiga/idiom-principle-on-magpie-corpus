 There are over 1,000 volunteer fire departments across the state of Illinois, and many of them dot the rural towns across Central Illinois, including in the Canton area. Within each of those departments are brave hometown heroes, who regularly drop everything to help a neighbor in crisis.
 However, if my 20-plus years in the fire service have taught me anything, it's that sometimes firefighters don't feel there is room for that image of a courageous firefighter to co-exist with someone reaching out for mental health help.
 Sadly, this misperception has led to far too many firefighters to take their own lives after bottling up all of the stress from the job inside for too long. In fact, firefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.
 Responding to a cardiac arrest, fatal fire or car wreck can be traumatic, but answering those calls can be particularly difficult for volunteer firefighters in small towns because they likely know someone involved. To make matters worse, many times these firefighters don't go back to the firehouse and debrief after a tough call. Instead, they return home to their families where they refrain from discussing the difficult things they've witnessed, and instead, suppress their emotions in unhealthy ways.
 Many first responders also have a fixer mentality - since they focus on fixing problems and helping people in their communities, it might seem burdensome to admit they have problems of their own. It might be difficult for them to explain to friends or family what they are going through out of fear that others might not understand.
 It's time to turn the tide when it comes to the mental health crisis among volunteer firefighters in Central Illinois. How do we begin? By ending the stigma connected to mental health in our volunteer firehouses, taking the time to debrief tough calls together and making firefighters aware of the mental health resources available to them.
 One of those mental health resources is Illinois Firefighter Peer Support, which I have been involved with for three years as the Central Illinois Coordinator. Illinois Firefighter Peer Support is a 450-firefighter-strong network of trained, peer supporters providing career and volunteer first responders with a safe, non-judgmental and confidential environment where they can engage in a healing conversation. It's a trusted place for first responders to get help from someone who has likely been on traumatic calls themselves and really understands the unique pressures of the job.
 In addition to matching first responders to peer supporters, ILFFPS helps fire departments conduct debriefing sessions after tough calls and can connect those suffering from emotional trauma with mental health professionals specialized in the needs of first responders.
 Protecting our communities begins with first protecting ourselves, and that includes mental health and well-being. I urge all firefighters in our region, including volunteers, who need help to contact the ILFFPS Peer Support Hotline at 855-90-SUPPORT or email ILFFPS at Ilffps1@gmail.com.
 Real bravery begins with being open about your mental health and getting help when you need it.

BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned Tuesday that the military organization could pay a heavy price for leaving Afghanistan too early, after a U.S. official said President Donald Trump is expected to withdraw a significant number of American troops from the conflict-ravaged country in coming weeks.NATO has fewer than 12,000 troops from dozens of nations in Afghanistan helping to train and advise the national security forces. U.S. troops frequently make up about half that number, and the 30-nation alliance relies heavily on the United States armed forces for transport, logistics and other support.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, wearing a face mask stands next to Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis before their meeting in Athens on Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020. Stoltenberg warns there may be consequences from a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan.“We now face a difficult decision. We have been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and no NATO ally wants to stay any longer than necessary. But at the same time, the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.He said the country still “risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands. And ISIS (Islamic State) could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq.”The U.S. decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The expected plans would cut U.S. troop numbers almost in half by Jan. 15, leaving 2,500 troops in Afghanistan.U.S. officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawal and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders.NATO took charge of the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003, two years after a U.S-led coalition ousted the Taliban for harboring former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. In 2014, it began to train and advise Afghan security forces, but has gradually pulled troops out in line with a U.S.-brokered peace deal. Stoltenberg said that “even with further U.S. reductions, NATO will continue its mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. We are also committed to funding them through 2024.”NATO’s security operation in the country is its biggest and most ambitious undertaking ever. It was launched after the military alliance activated its mutual defense clause — known as Article 5 — for the first time, mobilizing all the allies in support of the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. “Hundreds of thousands of troops from Europe and beyond have stood shoulder to shoulder with American troops in Afghanistan, and over one thousand of them have paid the ultimate price,” Stoltenberg said.“We went into Afghanistan together. And when the time is right, we should leave together in a coordinated and orderly way. I count on all NATO allies to live up to this commitment, for our own security,” he said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hans-Dieter Schmidt, Sprecher Bürgerinitiative und Stadtrat in Wolfratshausen
 (C) Privat
 Warum?
 Zum einen hakt es an der Aufklärung. Die beschränkt sich in der Realität meist auf die Werbesprüche der Netzbetreiber oder auf den Hinweis, dass die Grenzwerte des Bundesamts für Strahlenschutz eingehalten werden. Eine offene Diskussion über alle Vor- und Nachteile der neuen Technik findet aber nicht statt. Gerade hier kommt lokalen Initiativen und Aktionsbündnissen eine wichtige Rolle zu. Sie können den Bürgern, vor allem aber auch den gewählten Kommunalpolitikern klar machen, dass es sich sehr wohl lohnt, sich kritisch mit dem Thema zu beschäftigen und dass es Handlungsmöglichkeiten gibt. Die sind viel wirksamer, als man im ersten Moment glauben mag. Und eigentlich muss sich die Gemeinde dafür nur ihres eigenen Instrumentariums bedienen.
 Nämlich?
 Der Planungshoheit. Wie bei jedem Bauvorhaben kann eine Kommune auch bei Mobilfunkmasten steuernd eingreifen. In der Bundesimmissionsschutzverordnung ist vorgeschrieben, dass ein Netzbetreiber spätestens acht Wochen vor dem Aufstellen einer neuen Sendeanlage seinen Plan im Rathaus anmelden muss. Sobald das der Fall ist, muss die Gemeinde wach sein, schnell reagieren und ein Vorsorgekonzept in Auftrag geben. Darin lassen sich alternative Standorte im vom Betreiber genannten Suchkreis festlegen. So kann man erreichen, dass der Sender an einem Platz aufgestellt wird, an dem die Strahlenbelastung für die Anwohner möglichst minimal ist.
 Wer kann so etwas überhaupt beurteilen?
 Es gibt qualifizierte Fachbüros, die diese Berechnung mittels 3D-Modellen durchführen. Allerdings sind in ganz Deutschland nur eine Handvoll Experten dafür zertifiziert. Die Qualifikation ist aber sehr wichtig, weil das Gutachten nur dann nicht von den Netzbetreibern angefochten werden kann. Da der 5G-Ausbau aber gerade bundesweit Thema ist, sind die Büros oft überlastet, und es kommt teils zu längeren Wartezeiten.
 Sagten Sie nicht eben, dass die Zeit drängt?
 Schon, aber sobald die Gemeinde in die Initiative gegangen ist, kann sie sich eines weiteren Mittels aus dem Baurecht bedienen: der Veränderungssperre. Die lässt sich über das betroffene Gebiet legen, das damit zwei Jahre geschützt ist. In dieser Zeit kann der Gemeinderat einen Bebauungsplan beschließen, in dem festgelegt wird, wo Mobilfunkmasten zulässig sind und wo nicht.
 Und die Netzbetreiber können nicht dagegen klagen?
 Wenn man ihnen im gewünschten Suchkreis mögliche (Alternativ)Standorte nennt, müssen sie diese akzeptieren. Ein genereller Ausschluss ist nicht möglich, denn das wäre eine Negativplanung, die baurechtlich nicht zulässig ist. Darum geht es uns aber auch nicht. Wir wollen nicht Mobilfunk per se verhindern, sondern nur die Belastung und damit eine mögliche Gesundheitsgefährdung minimieren. Das sollte übrigens nicht nur im Interesse der Kommunen, sondern auch jedes einzelnen Bürgers sein, der ein Angebot von einem Netzbetreiber für die Miete eines Grundstücksteils als Senderstandort erhält.
 Wie sollten die Grundstückseigentümer in so einem Fall reagieren?
 Auf jeden Fall nicht sofort unterschreiben. Auch dann nicht, wenn die Mieteinnahmen sehr verlockend erscheinen. Ich empfehle jedem, zuerst das Gespräch mit der örtlichen Bürgerinitiative oder Rathausverwaltung zu suchen. Generell würde ich dringend raten, den Vertragsabschluss an eine Haftungsausschlusserklärung durch den Netzbetreiber zu koppeln. Dann sind diese für mögliche Spätfolgen verantwortlich. Diesen Hebel können natürlich auch die Kommunen nutzen. Entscheidend ist und bleibt aber eine eingehende und frühzeitige Information der Bürger, beispielsweise mit öffentlichen Veranstaltungen.
 In Corona-Zeiten sind die aber nicht durchführbar...
 Es gibt immer Möglichkeiten, in Dialog zu treten. Ich denke da zum Beispiel an den Kinofilm „5G – Die Technik, die neue Türen öffnet“, den der Haushamer Regisseur Matthias Nieschke mit der Zivilcourage Miesbach gedreht hat. Corona ist keine Ausrede, damit man sich mit diesem sicherlich komplexen Thema nicht beschäftigen muss. Gerade jetzt ist es wichtig, die wegweisenden Entscheidungen nicht zu verschlafen und quasi aus Unwissenheit und Unsicherheit im vorauseilenden Gehorsam den Netzbetreibern den Weg zu ebnen.

After our interview in episode 336 of a Justice Department official on how to read Schrems II narrowly, you knew it was only a matter of time before we heard from Europe. Charles Helleputte reviews the European Data Protection Board's effort to give more authoritative and less comfortable advice to U.S. companies that want to keep relying on the standard contractual clauses. The Justice Department take on the topic manages to squeak through without a direct hit from the privacy bureaucrats. Still, the EDPB (and the EDPS even more so) makes clear that anyone following the DOJ's lead is in for an uphill fight. (For those who want more of Charles's thinking on the topic, see this short piece.)

“It’s an unusual situation. We’ve said since Day 1, it’s one like no other,” Letizia said. “We need everybody to pull the load a bit. These situations, it’s a ‘we before me’ approach to help the greater good of the team.”
 The Tomahawks had home games against the New Jersey Titans postponed on Oct. 30-31 due to precautions taken amid the pandemic. The same teams had games postponed in New Jersey on Nov. 6-7.
 The make-up dates at 1st Summit Arena @ Cambria County War Memorial will be Dec. 18-19. The two games in New Jersey now will be rescheduled on Nov. 29 and Feb. 4.
 Last weekend, Danbury opted not to travel to Johnstown for two scheduled games over COVID-19 related issues.
 Throughout the three weeks, the Tomahawks were creative in terms of virtual meetings and practices, especially during the team’s quarantine time.
 “We stayed in touch quite a bit,” Letizia said. “We obviously had to be smart about what we did and taking care of each other. We did a lot of virtual exercising and team-building. We still found great ways to work together as a team, using technology.
 “It was impressive to see the guys make it work, though it’s not surprising,” he said. “This generation is really good with technology.
 “We kept it engaging and fun as much as possible.”
 The approach took on a more serious tone this week.
 “Danbury is a franchise that was in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton (in recent seasons),” Letizia said. “They have a few old players from the Knights, but the majority of players are new. They’re off to a good start.
 “For us it’s a new challenge, a new environment. We have a big test ahead of us, especially given our circumstances with a long layoff. We’re hoping the excitement of being back playing will give us an extra boost.”

I've delved a bit into the "intersectional" literature, to try to understand how scholars who believe that success in American life is primarily about the "privilege" of one's group explain the relative success and failure of groups like "Asian" writ large, but also the obvious difference in subgroups. It's a huge, risible mess. For example, one scholar posits that whites "let" Chinese and Japanese immigrants succeed because, unlike Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrants, they are relatively light-skinned. Putting aside whether the skin color thing is even true, one wonders how and when whites got together to decide this, how they enforce it, and how it explains why the most "successful" of all immigrant groups are Indian-Americans, who are relatively dark-skinned. But to an ideological hammer, everything looks like a nail.
