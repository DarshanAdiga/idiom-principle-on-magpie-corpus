Of course, it would be nice to have it both ways, but that just doesn’t seem realistic at this time. It’s hard to imagine an uncensored Deadpool bursting into the next Avengers film or the latest MCU shake-up taking place amid a flurry of severed limbs. If Liefeld is to be believed, Deadpool won’t be back in his very own movie for at least five years, giving Marvel Studios plenty of time to work out the exact logistics of his arrival. No doubt, he’ll have a lot to say about being kept waiting for so long…

On the one hand, Deadpool could be fully integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, perhaps arriving with his fellow mutants sometime in the next five years or so. But for the character to rub shoulders with the Avengers and play a major role going forward, he will need to be toned down to make him more palatable to general audiences.

A general view shows the exterior of Leicester City Football Club's King Power Stadium in Leicester, eastern England, on October 28, 2018 after a helicopter belonging to the club's Thai chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha crashed outside the stadium the night before. - Leicester City's charismatic Thai chairman was the subject of growing concerns on October 28 after a helicopter belonging to the billionaire crashed and burst into flames in the stadium car park shortly after taking off from the club's pitch following the match against West Ham United on October 27. There was no confirmation whether London-based Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who frequently flies to and from Leicester's home games by helicopter, was on board the aircraft which appeared to develop mechanical problems.

Even when Paramount sold “The Lovebirds” to a streamer after the pandemic scuttled the movie’s SXSW premiere and put the kibosh on its planned theatrical release, there was something vaguely charitable about the last- minute decision; it felt less like a studio cutting its losses than it did a studio trying to preserve a piece of the summer movie season. But that was back in March — two months and 100 year ago — before the near future was a foregone conclusion, and anyone who got their hopes up only had themselves to blame.
