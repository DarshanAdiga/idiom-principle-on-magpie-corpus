Conversely, though, gold export revenues rose by 6.9 percent on the back of a 17.1 percent rise in the gold price due to global monetary policy easing, geopolitical risks and the global economic slowdown – in such circumstances gold is regarded as safe haven by international investors thereby raising demand for the precious metal. Cocoa export revenues also rose by 8.7 percent year on year, despite a 7.7 percent fall in cocoa prices due to slackened demand for cocoa beans.

CARNEGIE — Patricia Vowels will have to wait a little longer for her COVID-19 relief check from the Kiowa Tribe.                  A Court of Indian Offenses (CFR) judge ruled Tuesday that any use of Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma funds, including the $19.7 million awarded to the tribe by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is to be decided by the tribe’s citizens.                  While the ruling puts the money, theoretically, in the hands of the tribal members, those hurting for relief due to emergencies tied to the COVID-19 crisis continue to grasp at straws in hopes for help.                  Among the roster of the over 12,000-member tribe is former Lawton resident Vowels. Living in Arlington, Texas, she said that her Social Security money isn’t enough to survive on. Especially after her granddaughters lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. She’s even had to sell her car to cover bills.                  When the tribe’s Executive Branch readied its spending plan and implemented its application process for COVID-19 assistance, Vowels said she jumped through hoops aplenty to get the process rolling. She thought things were moving forward, finally. She said she was wrong.                  “I still haven’t received anything from the Kiowas and now they are saying that the funds relief for COVID-19 is frozen by the Legislature,” she said. “Ain’t that something?”                  Vowels said her first application submitted June 9 was lost and refiled for her. She was assured she would get her money by Friday.                  “And now this,” she said.                  The freezing of tribe funds follows CFR Chief Magistrate Shannon L. Edwards’ ruling Tuesday that granted the preliminary injunction that was sought by the Legislature. With the ruling, Chairman Matthew Komalty and Vice-Chair Rhonda Ahhaitty and their agents/staff are stopped from withdrawing or paying out any funds received from the CARES Act until the Kiowa Indian Council (KIC), the supreme governing body according to the tribe’s constitution, approves a budget that contains the full amount of money provided to the tribe from the Treasury Department.                  The ruling is appealable with the court’s Appellate Division.                  Angela Chaddlesone McCarthy, District 1 Legislator and speaker for the Legislature, said the funds will remain frozen until the KIC votes in the annual budget election slated for Aug. 22.                  The Legislature filed for a temporary restraining order on June 17. They claimed the Executive Branch was violating the separation of powers mandated in the tribe’s constitution by preparing to spend the CARES Act funds without tribal council approval.                  Edwards cited the tribe’s constitution that was revised and passed in 2017 for her decision’s reasoning.                  “The Constitution is very clear that both the Legislature and the KIC have a role to play in establishing the annual budget of the Tribe and any modification thereto,” she wrote.                  Citing that “every funding item” in a budget must have been “previously authorized by law,” Edwards said it’s the Legislative Branch’s constitutional duty to authorize and appropriate as part of its essential function.                  Edwards also noted there are issues with how the Executive and Legislative branches have been informing the tribal members about what’s going on so that the KIC may assert its governmental role. With no budgetary laws enacted to implement the sections of the constitution, she said “it would seem prudent for the Legislature to develop those laws to help advise and assist it and the KIC carry out their duties.” She said the tribe’s budget process is not yet “well-defined.”                  Both the Executive and Legislative branches have been suffering from issues that “are not entirely unexpected growing pains of a young government.”                  “The Kiowa people adopted a governing document that requires all revenue and funds received from any and all sources to be included in a budget that is approved by the KIC,” Edwards wrote. “This can happen through the annual budget or a budget modification, but all budgeting is subject to approval by the KIC, and every line item in an approved budget must be authorized and appropriated.”                  Edwards said the Executive Branch claimed the tribe will be harmed with the issuance of the injunction because of its program that had just begun to assist tribal members by making CARES Act funds available. The Legislative Branch argued the Executive program “will not provide sufficient direct financial aid” to tribal members and, instead, is distributed and directed through tribal programs.                  In the end, the Chief Magistrate determined that the public interest is broader than ensuring the Executive Branch is allowed to “carry out what may be a good COVID-19 response plan,” or the Legislature’s implicated desire to pay out a majority of CARES Act funds to Kiowa members (a proposed $1,000 per person).”                  “All three branches have a role to play in making and enacting budgetary policy and law and the public interest is best served when those entities agree or, at least, compromise with respect to their budget, and specifically the CARES Act funds the Tribe received to respond to the harm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” she wrote. “There is no other way.”                  The Constitution contacted a spokesperson for Komalty, but did not receive a response as of Wednesday evening.                  The turmoil between factions of the tribe and the Executive Branch has other elements at the moment.                  The legislative branch voted unanimously on June 22 to approve moving forward with an impeachment hearing for Komalty. The impeachment and the lawsuit are separate actions.                  The five impeachment charges cite five allegations of failure to follow protocols of the Kiowa Constitution, including the distribution of the CARES Act funding.                  Calling the allegations “an example of misrepresentation of accuracy,” Komalty has denied all of the allegations.                  A recall petition seeking a hearing for the ouster of Komalty is also circulating as a “sort of backup” if the Legislature fails to remove Komalty from office, according to Chaddlesone-McCarthy. More than 1,500 names of eligible tribal voters are needed for a recall hearing to be held for the KIC to cast a vote.                  In the end, the combative drama between the governmental branches is affecting tribal members like Patricia Vowels and others. As the disputed funds remain frozen until the outcome of an election or an overruling of the injunction through appeal, they will be awaiting word and hope for relief.

Leading auto parts maker Wheels India will commence export of cast aluminium wheels to the US from September.           The TVS Group company had, last month, indicated that it would go ahead with its capex plan in the current fiscal in view of robust demand in cast aluminium business amid challenging outlook in the domestic market.           The company’s new cast aluminium plant near Gummidipoondi, which is coming up on an investment of ₹140 crore, is expected to commence operations in September and the company will start shipping products from this unit to the US.           “This financial year will be a difficult one due to declining economies in India and overseas. However, taking a longer-term view, we have invested in a cast aluminium wheel factory that will start exports to the US market from September. The demand for the forged aluminium wheels in international markets is expected to improve in the coming year,” S Ram, Chairman, Wheels India Ltd, told the shareholders during the virtual annual general meeting of the company.           The new initiatives made in the supply of welded and machined parts for the wind energy sector, mostly to international companies; and supply of bogie frames to the Indian Railways saw significant growth in the last financial year. The demand for these products should revive post lockdown, he added.           Ram said amidst all the negativity, one silver lining has been how the farm Sector has performed so far. With good monsoon rains and government support through higher prices and timely purchase by the Food Corporation of India, the agricultural sector is expected to grow. After the decline last year, these factors will auger well for the agricultural tractor sector, where Wheels India is a major supplier of wheels.           ## Passenger car segment          While the passenger car market has been severely affected by the lockdown, it is expected that the market demand could shift to small cars and utility vehicles in the coming year, he said           In the commercial vehicle segment, demand for small commercial vehicles may improve post lockdown. The demand for tippers would depend on the implementation of infrastructure projects by the government.           Answering a question, Srivats Ram, Managing Director of Wheels India Ltd, said: “The Covid impact on company’s business was significant in the first 45 days of the year with the complete lockdown. In June, our capacity utilization was around 42 per cent.           “Starting Q3 and Q4, we should start seeing a pick-up in business from the current levels,” he added.           Srivats Ram pointed out that globally the prospects for the wind energy business looked good “We have just started exports to one OEM and will explore more OEMs going forward.”           Chairman S Ram said that while the government has started the process of easing supply lines for production and distribution, demand for most non-essential goods has slumped. It seems to be not only about monetary easing and money but uncertainty in the minds of consumers.           “It may take till a credible vaccine is developed and made available to all, for normalcy to return,” he said.

The City Council agreed Tuesday to amend the six-year contract it has with the city firefighters’ union.                  Council members voted in February to approve what city administrators called an “unprecedented” contract with the International Association of Firefighters, Local 1882, one that included the 2019-2020 fiscal year that ended June 30 while extending through the end of the 2024-2025 fiscal year, or June 30, 2025. At the time, city administrators said the long-term contract means city and firefighters wouldn’t return to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts from scratch for years, although revisions in the contract may be done periodically throughout its term.                  That’s what happened Tuesday when the council returned from executive session and voted unanimously to accept a Memorandum of Understanding that changes three areas.                  The agreement specifies that incentive pay for eligible non-probationary members of the department as of July 31, 2019, would be given on July 31 for the duration of the contract, rather than the May 31 date set in the original contract. The incentive is to be paid from funding designated for that option in the city’s Capital Improvement Program. The agreement removes a provision that would have allowed additional funds to be paid if additional money is available in the CIP.                  In addition, the change adopts a provision that city administrators said puts holiday pay “more in line” with the city’s buy-back option, referring to 96 hours of flexible holiday pay provided to firefighters in addition to the eight holidays observed by the City of Lawton. The option means the city will compensate firefighters for unused flexible holiday time, up to 88 hours.

Proponents of the hike cited a 4% increase in the wholesale rate charged to the city by the French Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant. The city passed on to customers previous outside rate hikes affecting sewer bills, Mayor Kevin Corcoran said at a council meeting earlier this month.
 A clause in the new legislation means the city automatically will pass on outside rate hikes to customers with no legislative approval needed. The loss of that control by council is the reason for her no vote, Hung said.
 “I’m just not really happy with the way this legislation is written,” she said.
 The rate hike was termed an “unfortunate necessity” by Ward 4 Councilman Clifford Winkel.
 While the rate increase by the French Creek Plant is part of the reason for the hike, a rate study performed by Cleveland-based consultant AECOM accounts for the additional 6%. The study contends that increase is needed to fund capital improvements and keep the sewer fund solvent. The study assumed the city would collect money at the increased rate for six months of 2020.
 A third reading of the rate legislation would have meant the new rate would not be collected until September. That would give the city only four months of increased collections this year, Corcoran said, adding that is why he asked council to pass the measure as an emergency. The city still will only gain five months of increased collections in 2020, he said.
 “We are helping ourselves in the long run,” Corcoran said, adding that North Ridgeville eventually must undertake the work recommended in the consultant study. The city did not pass on to customers until now the French Creek rate increase that took effect in January, he said.
 “We are in the middle of a pandemic,” Swenk said. “A 10% increase is a big hit.”
 The current rate for residential users is $5.21 per hundred cubic feet. The rate will increase to $5.73 per hundred cubic feet. The current rate for commercial users is $5 per hundred cubic feet, which increases to $6.01. The monthly base charge of $9 would remain the same for all users. The average monthly residential bill will increase by $2.83 per month, Corcoran said.

 Lawmakers moved to its third reading legislation authorizing a $164,000 engineering study of a proposed new roundabout at the three-way intersection of Mills Road, Stoney Ridge Road and Avalon Drive. Constituents sent Swenk a number of emails with concerns about the roundabout, she said.
