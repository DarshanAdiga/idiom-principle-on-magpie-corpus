 # Judge Erin Perry deserves to keep her seat
 Florida Times-Union Editorial Board
 Judicial races are the most difficult for the voters.
 Voters don’t see the judges in action. They can’t determine the candidate’s possible demeanor in court, whether a candidate will treat people fairly or whether the candidate will run an efficient docket.
 A bio and resume can provide hints but it can leave voters with many questions.
 That is why readers are most likely to turn to the Times-Union’s endorsement for judicial positions more than any other race.
 And that is why during this summer of staff cutbacks, furloughs and other disruptions, the lone Times-Union endorsement is on a race for a county court position.
 It involves a rare challenge to an incumbent. In Northeast Florida, incumbent judges are rarely opposed in elections in contrast to South Florida.
 Judge Erin Perry is in just her first term on the bench. She was appointed by Gov. Rick Scott to her seat in January 2019 over five other candidates.
 Perry has an inspiring personal story, coming from a family in a poor tobacco farming area of North Central Florida. She worked her way through college and law school at the University of Florida.
 Those humble beginnings are clearly expressed in her courtroom.
 “I believe my courtroom is a place where people can feel safe, where they will not be ridiculed,” she told the Times-Union Editorial Board.
 Perry’s professional experience was spent entirely on the prosecution and criminal justice side, though she did take a course on civil cases. Is she too focused on prosecution?
 Perry said she is proud that her campaign includes attorneys from both the prosecution and defense side.
 In fact, one of her most memorable cases as a prosecutor involved dropping charges.
 She says she has an open mind, which is part of her emphasis on fairness.
 As for assessing her work ethic, Perry said that speaks for itself.
 “I show up, I don’t complain. When things are tough, I just do the work,” she said.
 Her community work includes membership in the South Jacksonville Rotary, mentoring and church volunteering.
 The Editorial Board would like to see judges spend more time in the community within the boundaries of judicial ethics. And those in the judiciary should spend more time assessing the often unconscious disparities involved in their decisions.
 Her opponent, Rhonda Peoples Waters, is notable for her relentless persistence of a judicial seat. Her name has been sent to the governor 13 times from the Judicial Nominating Commission. That implies her peers consider her to be qualified.
 She brings 13 years of experience in civil law and 20 years experience in criminal law. She also has experience in private practice.
 Like Perry, she has an inspiring personal story. Her parents were educators who worked several jobs. They told Peoples Waters that she would need scholarships to go to college, which she did.
 She presented herself well in the Times-Union’s Zoom interview but this wasn’t her first time. In fact, the Times-Union endorsed her in a previous judicial race in 2008.
 That persistence is bound to pay off one day, if not on the judiciary then we could envision her in City Council or the Legislature.
 The endorsement decision was not an easy one. The Editorial Board discussed this for an hour before deciding that the incumbent, Perry, deserves to retain her seat.
