“I think ‘historical’ always sums up a season when you're able to set so many records and accomplish so many things," said Bears coach Scott Drew, whose team was in the running for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament after finishing second to Kansas in the Big 12 race. “This group really got along well. It is a group that really loved one another, spent time with one another, and they were always positive, and that led us to having a historical year."

Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.
 After a lull, new hardware announcements are creeping back in. Sony followed up on Microsoft's Xbox Series X spec reveal with its own numbers-heavy rundown for the PS5. With GDC canceled it came off as a pretty dry spectacle -- I'm not sure why the company teased the stream yesterday. For those looking to scrutinize teraflops and other vital statistics, though, it was everything they'd need.
 Hours earlier, Apple revealed a new iPad Pro with a 3D-sensing camera and a companion keyboard accessory that adds a trackpad, too. It also had a new MacBook Air with its own much-improved keyboard, while keeping it just under the $1,000 mark.
 Note there were no splashy press events or gatherings, however. It's a time of digital briefings on teleconference software, where most won't get to touch a device -- at least not immediately. It makes for drier meetings, but that's the new reality for the time being.

It will likely be based on the facelifted version of the regular Q5 and should get a warm SQ5 Sportback variant to fight the “M40i” and “43” models from Bavaria and Stuttgart, respectively. With Audi Sport expressing its desire to launch more SUV, there’s a pretty good chance RS Q5 models are also in the pipeline.

So just exactly what is this "friendship" thing? For that matter how important is it? For most CIOs, friendship is very important. We'd all like to have as many friends as we possibly can. However, in this day and age we often indicate our friendship with someone by "friending" them in online social media sites. As both you and I know, friendships can change over time and so that brings up the big question: should we friend people at work if we may just end up un-friending them online later on?

Apple gets zero points from me from taking the best keyboard on any laptop and screwing it up across the whole laptop line for _several years_ before correcting course. But at least it _is_ correcting course, and it’s easier to recommend upgrading your MacBook again.
 Oh, and the MacBook Air is still the only Mac laptop you can get without the Touch Bar, which is a big plus in my book; I greatly prefer the physical function keys. You still get the useful Touch ID sensor on the right, though.
 ## I still want USB-A and a better camera
 The new MacBook Air seems like a lot more of what we wanted and expected out of its recent redesign, but it still has a couple of sore spots.
 Apple is still determined to make every USB port feature a USB-C connector. We’ve been told that the ubiquity of USB-C devices is just around the corner for years now, and it’s still not happening. Accessory makers keep cranking out mice, keyboards, storage devices, microphones, audio interfaces, and loads of other things with USB-A connectors on them. Putting a single USB-A port on MacBooks would not be a step backwards, it would be recognition that in the wide world of USB devices, that interface is still widespread, and we shouldn’t need a dongle or dock to use them.
