In a press conference Tuesday, Gov. Brian Kemp along with Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey urged Georgians to keep gatherings small and within the same household and host get-togethers outside if possible to reduce the risk of exposure indoors.
 "We all know as the weather continues to turn cold more people spend time indoors and we’ve seen a rise in Georgia cases in recent weeks. In light of that — with not only Christmas, Hanukkah, the New Year and other holiday celebrations right around the corner — we’re asking all Georgians to continue to do a few simple things to help limit the spread of the virus.”

ST. LOUIS (AP) — Jim Hanifan, the former St. Louis Cardinals coach who returned to the city as offensive line coach to help the Rams win the Super Bowl, has died. He was 87. Hanifan’s daughter, Kathy Hinder, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he died Tuesday at Missouri Baptist Hospital. She said the cause of death hasn't been determined, but said it wasn't related to COVID-19. The Cardinals' head coach from 1980-85, Hanifan is best known for his offensive lines as an assistant with St. Louis and Washington. He coached star tackle Dan Dierdorf and notorious guard Conrad Dobler with St. Louis, then directed the “Hogs” in Washington. Hanifan went 39–49–1 with the Cardinals, reaching the playoffs in 1982. He won Super Bowls as an assistant with Washington after the 1991 season and the Rams after the 1999 season. Hanifan came to St. Louis in 1973 along with head coach Don Coryell from San Diego State. He also coached in the college at Utah and California, and was an NFL assistant in San Diego, too, and interim head coach of the Falcons. A star receiver at California, Hanifan played a season for Toronto in the Canadian Football League. After his coaching career, he was a color analyst on Rams' broadcasts.

"Dito ko nalaman talaga 'yung importance ng pag-aalaga sa sarili. Kasi dati talaga, tipid talaga ako. So pati ang sarili ko nade-deprive ko sa mga simpleng pagkain, ganyan. So ngayon parang talagang physical health muna rin ako. And parang doon ko na-realize na puwede ka ngang magtrabaho, maging productive ka nga, pero at the end of the day exhausted ka pa rin. So iba pa rin talaga kapag inaalagaan mo 'yung health mo," ani Karina.
