Tokaj, histórica región del nordeste húngaro, ha vuelto a tener eco en fechas recientes a propósito del lanzamiento al mercado de una edición especial del Royal Tokaji Eszencia 2008, tipo de vino dulce único, envasado en una botella de 1,5 litros y cuyo productor cobra US$40.000 por cada una. Ya ha vendido once de las veinte producidas. Se envasa en una elegante botella de vidrio soplado, puesta en el interior de una caja lacada e iluminada con un foco interior para sacar a relucir el brillante ocre del vino. Solo los entendidos saben lo que esconde este elixir.
