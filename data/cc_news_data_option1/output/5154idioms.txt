 On the other hand, they also announce that the new Season event will be called The Prince of Limestone and the Dragon and will take place in Dragonwing. There we can meet Albedo, the chief alchemist and captain of the Knights of Favonius research team, and together with him we will have to solve the mystery that surrounds a powerful sword called Poison Wish. It should be noted that thanks to this event we will be able to obtain and refine the Poisonous Wish weapon to the maximum as well as other rewards such as the Crown of Wisdom (in the event store).

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) — A Hawaii woman has been sentenced to serve at least two decades in prison for killing a 6-year-old boy in a case that revealed a pattern of abuse that the judge characterized as torture. Ashley Nihipal was sentenced to the maximum term of 20 years for causing the death of Mazen Kaniela Nihipali-Moniz at a Big Island apartment complex on Halloween in 2018 while she was caring for the boy, West Hawaii Today reported Sunday.

Authorities said Nihipali- Moniz was choked by Nihipal after his school reported to her that the boy removed a Lego piece from a book. “Eventually he stopped breathing,” Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Chase Murray said. “The autopsy showed body bruising, signs of strangulation and bleeding from the liver.” Nihipali’s wife, Kuuipo Nihipali, was also charged in connection with the case and agreed to testify against her spouse. Nihipali-Moniz and four other children under the care of the women suffered a series of abuses after moving in with the couple, Murray said. “They were beaten, choked and burned with hot water,” Murray said. The women told the children to lie to investigators about the death, but they eventually revealed what they witnessed, Murray said. Ashley Nihipal entered a plea agreement with prosecutors,...
