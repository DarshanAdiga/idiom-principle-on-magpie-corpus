Another way to use styling to keep your table compact and enjoyable for the eye, is to make sure the headers aren’t too long. This is to prevent the columns from needing to become too wide or different in width, or the header cells to become multiline. Of course, you could simply use abbreviations or other terms for your headers. But there’s a neat little function baked into Google Sheets, that might do the trick even better, and will even give your table a sassy look.

Meanwhile, there are other consequential effects. The present inactivity regarding learning holds scary prospects of mental seediness on the part of pupils, if not indeed their teachers. To make this point from personal lenses, every time I look out of the window and see pupils fritter away idle time – apparently with their teachers up to other engagements – I dread what it would take to jumpstart the brains of both pupils and teachers when schooling resumes. The hype about virtual teaching and learning is cold comfort because there is no equitable access to make that method effective. All these isn’t to mention huge economic losses associated with shuttering schools – public and private – sine die.

To be sure, stepping down 2020 WASSCE portends dislocations for the education system far beyond the secondary level. The Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) has held its Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, with respective university having conducted complementary screenings. Candidates who scaled those hurdles will be hindered from getting into university on account of not having the School Certificate qualification. Notice that if WASSCE is not feasible anytime soon, the prospects of NECO and NABTEB holding are up in the air.

The fiery emotion is his hallmark. He showed it with a tee shot that sailed left into a creek on the 11th hole, Rahm slamming his club into the ground in a pique of anger. And it was evident with that ferocious fist-pump when his flop shot from deep rough behind the 16th green rolled into the cup.
 Birdie or bogey, it was a winner, a shot that would have made Ballesteros proud.
 “I still can't believe it, I'm not going to lie,” he told Nicklaus off the 18th green.
 With the penalty — Rahm had no idea it was an issue after his round, but accepted the penalty when he saw a video that zoomed in close on the ball — he finished at 9-under 279 for his 10th career victory, fourth on the PGA Tour.
 Muirfield Village played its toughest in 42 years, with only five players under par, the fewest for the final round since this tournament began in 1976. Rahm's 75 was the highest finish by a winner since Roger Maltbie shot 76 the inaugural year.
 The rough wasn't cut all week. The greens were allowed to go to the edge because they are being replaced. Crews already had stripped the entire fifth green as the leaders were on the back nine.

Unlimited hydroplane champion Scott Pierce died early Sunday morning.
 Pierce, 64, lived in Woodinville and died at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland from organ failure.
 Pierce, whose dad Laird owned unlimited hydroplanes in the 1960s, started his driving career in 1981, earning co-rookie of the year honors. He drove the Mr. Pringles among other boats.
 His best season came in 1991 when he drove the Miss Budweiser to the National High Points Championship.
 Pierce retired from driving in 2001. Known for his big personality, he did color commentating on TV broadcasts, and for the last three years owned the GP-55 in the Grand Prix hydroplane class. Pierce was a former partner at Seattle Boat Company and he owned Cabo Marine in Woodinville.
 “He was a friend to many in H1 Unlimited and our condolences are with the Pierce family,” H1 Unlimited tweeted.

At the sub-national level, the reversal refreshed historical faultline of regional politics over national education policy. Commissioners of education in the northern states rooted for decision, saying keeping schools shut amidst spiraling coronavirus infections was a wise call to keep pupils safe. “We have, therefore, resolved that schools should be reopened only when it is safe to do so and when states have complied with the minimum Covid-19 safety protocols as outlined by the NCDC,” they said inter alia in a communique. South-west states took an opposite stance, saying they preferred schools reopening and fielding pupils for the 2020 SSCE. A statement after a virtual meeting convened by the Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN) Commission in collaboration with the forum of south-west education commissioners, special advisers on education and the State Universal Basic Education Board chairmen said the states were ready, although they entertained the option of formally seeking a postponement of the examination by WAEC rather than unilateral withdrawal. They as well urged the examination body to consider administering Computer-Based Tests.

The latest _PUBG_ lore drop revisits the question of why the titular Battlegrounds exist at all, and kicks off a light ARG tied to the upcoming re- release of the Sanhok map.
 Sanhok will return on Wednesday, July 22, and it seems like it will have some ties to the Sanhok 4 revealed in the video above. The video opens with a behind-the-curtain look at the folks maintaining the in-universe Battlegrounds matches, complete with stream chat moderator and Blue Zone Guy. Things quickly go to hell when a squad of four especially dangerous participants drop off the net and invade the control bunker on the island. The video ends with an appearance from the no-doubt disgustingly rich mastermind behind the Battlegrounds, who's become a recurring shadowy character in these lore drops.
 Profiles for the Sanhok 4 are available on the PUBG _website_. They're all some flavor of murderer, basically, from born and raised psychopaths to ex- military turned mercenaries. PUBG Corp. not-so-subtly invites players to participate in the investigation into the Sanhok 4's goals and whereabouts, and it says additional hints will be shared in the days ahead, so expect this to come to a head on Wednesday.
 It's not quite as bizarre as that _Jonathan Frakes segment about a child murderer_, but I reckon the Sanhok 4 archives are a worthy addition to the growing library of weird-ass PUBG lore. Like most players, I always just kind of accepted that PUBG dropped 100 players onto an island full of guns Because Video Game, but I'll be damned if it isn't fun to watch PUBG Corp. graft an actual story onto things.
 _These_ _ _PUBG tips__ _may not help you find the Sanhok 4, but they will help you stay alive when you drop on Sanhok for the first time in a while._

Fowler reported several teams are interested in Brown, but that the assumption is also that he will at some point be suspended by the NFL for at least a few games and that any signing wouldn't likely happen until that is resolved.
 Brown's history obviously means that no one is going to take his tweet too literally, and few would be surprised if he ends up back in the NFL at some point — at 32, he could still have some good years left, just one year removed from having had a string of six straight seasons of 1,000 receiving yards or more.
 As Fowler noted, the Seahawks also remain waiting to hear if the NFL will reinstated Josh Gordon from his indefinite suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy last season.
 It's generally thought Gordon will likely have to miss at least two games to fulfill a suspension for PED use with the NFL then deciding if he would be further suspended for a separate violation of substances of abuse.
 But with NFL training camps still set to open next week, whether either Brown or Gordon will even be available to play this season — or when — remains an unknown.
 Brown, though, was doing his best to convince people his career really is done.
 "I came i saw i conquered mission complete Call God,'' he tweeted in a follow- up to his initial tweet.
 Time will tell.
