Huntsman remains focused on growing its downstream specialty and formulation businesses and is shifting its MDI (methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) business from components to differentiated systems that typically have higher margins and lower volatility.      The company’s Polyurethanes segment, which accounted for more than half of its revenues last year, is well positioned for strong upside in the long term on the back of its focus on ramping up its high-value differentiated downstream portfolio. Substitution of MDI for less effective materials will remain a key driving factor for the MDI business.      Huntsman should also gain from synergies of strategic acquisitions. The buyout of Demilec, a leading manufacturer and distributor of spray polyurethane foam ("SPF") insulation systems in North America, is expected to offer significant synergies.      Moreover, the acquisition of Icynene-Lapolla, a leading North American manufacturer and distributor of SPF, is in line with Huntsman’s strategy of expanding its downstream polyurethanes business. The combination of Icynene- Lapolla with Demilec is expected to create the world's leading supplier of spray foam products.      The company, in May 2020, also completed the acquisition of CVC Thermoset Specialties, a North American specialty chemical producer that serves industrial composites, adhesives and coatings markets. The buyout is in sync with the company’s strategy of expanding its specialty Advanced Materials portfolio.      Per Huntsman, the integration of CVC Thermoset Specialties and Icynene-Lapolla buyouts is ahead of plans and the company expects to achieve total annualized targeted synergies of $35 million for these acquisitions by the end of 2021.      Moreover, the company last month announced updates on its third-quarter 2020 guidance. It expects adjusted EBITDA in the Polyurethanes segment to be at least 40% better compared with previous guidance provided during second- quarter earnings call.      Huntsman noted that the improved outlook reflects continued strength in construction related markets as well as better-than-expected improvement in automotive demand and higher overall margins.

VR has been the great hope of the tech industry for years now, but it has struggled to live up to the hype. Some early adopters have bought into the technology, and there are a small suite of video games catering to them – just over one in 100 Steam users own a VR headset, according to the latest figures released by the desktop gaming platform. But a combination of high prices and a lack of content have put the brakes on the industry. That could be about to change.          On October 13, Oculus – the Facebook owned VR hardware company – is releasing the Quest 2, its most affordable headset yet. It is a standalone ‘VR games console,' and doesn’t require any additional hardware to play games or watch content. There is a compelling line up of games, including entries in the _Medal of Honor_ and _Assassin’s Creed_ franchises, and a game set in the _Jurassic World_ universe. But the most important factor could be price. At £299, the Quest 2 will bring VR within reach for a lot more casual consumers.

If VR is truly going to take off, it can’t just be based on first person games. A lot more content like _Micro Monsters_ will be required in order to convince people that an investment in a VR headset is worth it, or the experiences need to be compelling enough to convince them to make a trip to a museum or cinema to take part there. We may see a similar trajectory to other ‘immersive’ technologies such as IMAX, which when they first launched were often confined to visually stunning nature documentaries, before later making the leap to a tool used by mainstream filmmakers (it wasn’t until 2008’s _The Dark Knight_ that a mainstream movie release was shot on IMAX cameras, for instance).

The school swiftly had to pivot to 100% remote learning for the start of the school year when school officials discovered students had held a party. On Friday, Sept. 11, dozens of students were reported to have attended a party involving alcohol and a disregard of COVID-19 safety precautions, according to Principal Bella Wong.          The switch was made in order to limit the potential spread of the COVID-19 virus. After two weeks of remote learning, the district has now shifted into a hybrid model.

In a year that has thrown a pandemic, natural disasters and economic calamity at us while we lurch closer to a presidential election, stability can feel elusive. No matter how well laid your plans, some new crisis might be lurking around the corner, waiting to upend your life.
 While it’s never been more clear how much is out of our control, you can still take steps to improve your financial stability. And it’s not just about cash flow.
 FIND YOUR IDEA OF STABILITY
 Financial stability is both a state of money and a state of mind, says Ed Coambs, a certified financial planner and certified financial therapist near Charlotte, North Carolina.
 On the money side, stability is straightforward. “You have a budget, you know where your money is going, and you know how much you should be saving to meet your bigger goals,” Coambs says.
 “What’s a little harder is more the state of mind,” Coambs says. This financial peace of mind is subjective and looks different from one person to the next.
 Do some self-reflection to pin down what stability means for you. Maybe you don’t want to feel anxious when you check your bank balance, or you hope to save enough for retirement so you won’t have to worry about the future. Whatever your focus, feeling stable means you won’t have to constantly worry about money.
