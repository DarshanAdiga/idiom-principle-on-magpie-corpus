The Bucks took the lead first in the second, thanks in large part to a towering three-run home run off the bat of Ben Doremus. For Doremus, it was his first home run of the year and the third of the series for the Bucks. Waterloo scored four in the second inning to give themselves some cushion early.
 Willmar answered with a run in the bottom half of the inning as Schnurbusch scored on a wild pitch, but Willmar was unable to get substantial runs off of Waterloo starter Ben Olson. Olson went six innings for the Bucks, giving up two runs on just four hits.
 The Stingers kept the disadvantage fairly close for most of the way, as Waterloo held a 6-3 lead going into the ninth. It was in that ninth where the Bucks put the game out of reach. The Bucks scored four runs in the top half of the inning to take a seven-lead into the bottom of the ninth. While Willmar added one more run in the ninth on a Kyle Manzardo RBI base hit, it was too little too late as the Bucks won 10-4.
 Jack Zigan, the Stingers starter, threw his season-long outing, going seven strong, allowing six runs on ten hits, striking out four. Reliever Ben Borrman pitched his best all season, throwing a scoreless inning of relief, striking out a pair.
 At the plate, Brooks Lee had himself a multi-hit game, including a double. Griffin Cheney also had a pair of hits in the loss, scoring two of the Stingers' four runs.
 Willmar drops to 19-16, but take the season series from Waterloo by a total of 5-4. The Stingers back in action tomorrow as they travel to St. Cloud to face the Rox in a two game series.

Many of the migrants have been arriving in Ethiopia with only the clothes on their backs, with few or no other possessions. More than 50,000 cooking utensils have been provided to equip quarantine facilities.
 “Together with our partners at IOM, we have been able to respond to the needs of returning migrants,” said Eyob Yisfawossen, NRC’s Area Manager in Jigjiga. "The situation at the regional quarantine centres is dire, to say the least and the need for essential items such as clothes, sanitary items, and bedding, is immediate."
 The assistance is being provided in Shire, Metema, Dire Dawa, Jigjiga, and Semera, the five regional towns, where many of the migrants enter the country on foot and by bus.
 “We had several challenges with provision of services in the quarantine centre at the start of the pandemic,” explained Addis Alem, the Dire Dawa University quarantine centre manager. “With the supplies we’re receiving from NRC, IOM and others, the quarantine centre is now fully operational and able to meet the needs of vulnerable groups.”

Often, the more birthdays under your belt the less exciting they become. But this year, a special gift made mine worth celebrating: a Cameo video made for me by actress Allison Arngrim, who played Nellie Oleson on NBC's hit show "Little House on the Prairie."
 The video shared some behind-the-scenes recollections of working on the set of "Little House," one of my favorite childhood shows. Running from 1974 to 1983, "Little House" offered a feel-good comedic interlude to Americans weary of Watergate's political turmoil.
 The show's comedy was largely centered on "bad girl" Nellie Oleson, who was the perfect foil for heroine Laura Ingalls. Nellie was forever stirring things up with her manipulative behavior, then getting her comeuppance -- and I was there for it, along with the rest of America. From getting dunked to having things poured over her head, her slapstick downfalls kept all of us tuning in.
 Around that time, in the fall of 1974, I, too, was having my share of run-ins with bullies as a sixth-grader at Honeoye Central School. Once, a classmate threatened physical harm if I didn't turn over my lunch money. I refused and made a beeline to the principal's office. That didn't stop the bully from confronting me a second time and threatening, "No principal can protect you now."
 "No, but the police can," I responded. "Shall I call them in? I'm sure they already know you!"
 While that ended the unpleasant encounter, those years remained rough. I was processing the traumatic close-call of my mom nearly dying in a car accident in Rochester the previous fall, along with the growing pains of what we now call the "Middle School Years."
 "Little House" showed me a world where bullies always got their just dues and never failed to make me laugh. So, when Allison brought her comedy act to Rochester's 2016 Fringe Festival, I grabbed the chance to see her.
 Immediately, it was clear Allison is not the character she played on "Little House." She's fun, vivacious and kind, with a megawatt smile and easy connection with fans. Though "being Nellie Oleson" has shaped how the world has seen her, Allison has approached it with a comedian's spirit.
 The day after the first episode of "Little House" aired in September 1974, 12-year-old Allison headed back to school. She was not enormously popular and hoped being on television might help -- but thanks to her villainous TV personality, she had no such luck. As soon as she walked onto school grounds, a girl who had seen the show called out to Allison, "You b@t%h!"
 Knowing her reaction would set the tone, Allison called back brightly, "Thank you!"
 Her plucky spirit made me even more of a fan and watching Allison's Cameo on my birthday brought me back to the simple joy of watching "Little House." The memories Allison shared with me were priceless, from producer Michael Landon's love of Wild Turkey and hard work to fainting on set while filming in petticoats in the summer heat.
 And from surviving middle school with our spirits intact, to feeling pride in being able to help our parents buy groceries or make a mortgage payment, it turns out I have far more in common with "Nellie Oleson" than I ever would have dreamed.

FRUITLAND - At its regular meeting, the Fruitland City Council heard comment from Tim Davis, representative from Rywest Homes who brought some items regarding land use and zoning up for discussion.
 Davis asked the council to rezone the property being developed from single family dwellings to multi-family dwellings, in addition to seeking a variance for the size of a cul de sac.
 Jerry Campbell, Fruitland’s public works director, said that the international fire code states that there needs to be at least a 5-foot setback, Fruitland’s city code call for 8 feet.
 Councilwoman Kari Peterson objected to the variance saying that the Council has previously been strict on adhering to the 8-foot rule and it should be the same “across the board for everyone.”
 Fruitland City Administrator Rick Watkins added his thoughts on the variance.
 “I think five feet is just fine,” he said.
 The next item Davis brought up was reduction of the size of the side yards in lots 1 through 5 in Block 2 of the Bray development re-plat to be reduced to 6 feet, and to accept the preliminary plat of Bray Subdivision’s re-plat.
 The Council voted to approve the first two requests unanimously. The second two requests received a “no” vote from Peterson.

 Drivers beware, changes are coming to Peach Highlands with an eye at slowing speeders and putting a halt to a dangerous trend of jumping the hill.
 "For many decades that area has been sort of problematic," said Police Chief Robert Picariello.
 Cars racing up the hill with the goal of going airborne have been frustrating and terrifying neighbors. Peach Highland's resident Sean McHugh said he and his wife both grew up in Marblehead and are well aware of the road's reputation but what worries him is that it seems to be attracting out-of- towners. He said a girl from Beverly was recently stopped in the area and when they asked her what she was doing there she admitted she came to jump the hill.
 "That's the problem we have," he said.
 Solution
 Picariello said over the years a number of tactics have been tried and he'd like to revisit on of them, installing temporary speed bumps.
 "This is a really unique situation because of the intentional nature we're seeing," said Town Administrator Jason Silva. "People are seeking this road out to jump this hill."
 Silva said the plan is to install speed bumps on both sides of the hill that could be removed in the winter month or if it's determined they're not working.
 "This is our immediate response to this and given the uptick I think it's a good idea," he said
 Another possibility
 McHugh wondered if the town would consider posting cameras in the area and create a safety zone by slowing the speed limit to 20 mph.
 Jan Machnik said he recently had friends over for an outdoor socially distanced dinner, and upon leaving they had a very near miss when a car came flying over the hill just as they began to back out of Machnik's driveway. The pair mentioned the incident in a thank-you-for-dinner email to Machnik later that night. McHugh read the email where they wrote that they had never had such a close call and it shook them up beyond words.
 McHugh said it's not a question of if someone gets hurt, it's a question of when.
 "It's a blind hill," said Mary LeBlanc, who also lives on the road. "I back into my driveway because I'm afraid at the speed in which people come over the hill. I welcome the idea of a 20 mph speed limit."
 Picariello said he actually looked into camera's and the cost was not insignificant. He also said there could be other issues with using them.
 Silva also noted that the Board of Selectmen can't adopt a safety zone without a vote by Town Meeting authorizing them to do so. Such an article is actually on the Town Meeting warrant but Silva said that won't come to the table until the fall.
 "The quickest thing we can do is put up speed bumps … and we as a town can explore other opportunities," said Selectman Jim Nye.
 His colleagues agreed.
 "I shudder to think if someone actually got hurt," said Chairman Jackie Belf- Becker. "We need to take action now."
 "Speed bumps might not be perfect but it doesn't seem to have the holes and gaps the other issues have," added Selectman David Depew.
 The board voted 4-0, in its first meeting without Judy Jacobi, to install speed bumps on a 60-day trial basis.
 "I would ask the chief and town administrator and DPW to come up with some different options and come back to us as soon as possible," Belf-Becker added.
 "Works for me," Silva and Picariello said in unison.
 The neighbors gave a thumbs up to the plan.
 "The consensus is put the speed bumps in and make this stop before someone gets hurt," McHugh said.

Orlando settled for $150,000 to share.
 Orlando's appearance in the finale was a surprise considering the team finished 11th out of 12 in the East last season and fired coach James O’Connor. Oscar Pareja took over in 2020 and made an immediate impact.
 Pareja convinced his players, including star Nani, to settle into the bubble several days early. They won the tournament opener, a group-stage victory against Miami, and ended up spending nearly seven weeks quarantined in the bubble.
 Portland’s experience — the Timbers won the MLS title in 2015 and were runners-up two years ago — showed in the finale.
 Portland’s first shot on goal found the back of the net. Valeri delivered a perfectly placed free kick into the box that Larrys Mabiala headed past Gallese in the 27th minute. It was Valeri’s 93rd assist with the Timbers.
 But considering Portland has managed just three clean sheets in its last 23 matches, it was no surprise to see a defensive breakdown just a few minutes later.
 Nani worked the ball down the left side following a turnover and created enough room to get a crosser into the box. Mauricio Pereyra got a foot on the ball and then took advantage of a fallen defender to tie the match.
 The equalizer came shortly after Portland’s Sebastian Blanco and Orlando coach Pareja exchanged words during a hydration break. Referees stepped between them, and they later apologized and hugged it out.
 The league resumes its regular season Wednesday night with Dallas playing at Nashville. The league’s 26 teams will play 18 games apiece. A majority of the games will be played without fans because of local regulations. Teams will be subject to a rigorous testing protocol and will use charter flights or buses to limit outside contact.
 “We have to see if it works,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said. “If it does, we go through with it. If it doesn’t, we’ll have to adjust.”

The amount of unemployment benefits coming to Texans remained up in the air Monday as confusion persisted over President Donald Trump’s weekend executive orders designed to provide economic relief from the pandemic.
 On Saturday, Trump ordered that eligible unemployment recipients receive an extra $400 weekly — but only if states administer the funds and provide $100 of that amount. The order prompted bipartisan questions from governors about the administrative burdens and costs for states, along with questions about whether Trump had the constitutional authority to issue such an order.
 On Monday, Texas leaders didn't say whether the state would pay the money. The Texas Workforce Commission issued a statement to multiple news outlets that it’s “currently reviewing the presidential memoranda and will provide additional information as soon as it becomes available."
