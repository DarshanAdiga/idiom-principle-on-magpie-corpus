McKenah Sears' lifelong dream is finally coming true.
   
 The freshman basketball standout has finally arrived at Grain Valley High School and coach Randy Draper is set to give her the keys to run the Eagles' offense.
   
 And she won't be alone as fellow freshman Ella Quirarte and sophomore returnees Ella Clyman and Co-Examiner Player of the Year Grace Slaughter will round out Draper's young, but oh, so experienced kiddie corps, who hope to make some noise once the 2020-21 basketball season begins play.
   
 "I have dreamed of playing high school basketball forever," Sears said after Tuesday morning's practice session. "I got to third grade, then fourth grade and fifth grade and I'm thinking, 'Is it ever going to get here?' And now, it's here and I am so excited."
   
 Quirarte shares her enthusiasm.
   
 "I've dreamed about it too," Quirarte said, "especially after last season when Grace and Ella were freshmen and had such great seasons. This year, we're going to be young, but with McKenah and Grace and Ella, there's not going to be a lot of pressure being an underclassman, because so many of us are going to be underclassmen."
   
 And as Draper is quick to point out, underclassmen with a world of experience on the court.
   
 "We will be young, but we will be talented," Draper said, as you could see the twinkle in his eyes meant he was smiling under his mask. "Grace has already played an entire high school season worth of games with her AAU team - they're going to Iowa this weekend - and the other girls have played so much quality AAU ball.
   
 "And everyone who followed us knows what Grace and Ella did last year, and we're getting so many new players from that undefeated eighth grade team.
   
 "We have the chance to be good next year - and really good for many years after that."
   
 Add senior returnees Jordyn Weems and Malia Gutierrez into the mix and the veteran coach has the best of all basketball worlds.
   
 "We lost a couple of very good seniors to graduation, but with Jordyn and Malia coming back, we have that strong senior leadership and Grace and Ella have worked so hard this offseason that they are even better than they were last year."
   
 Which might be bad news for the Eagles' opponents.
   
 "I think we're really going to have a strong team, even though we are going to be so young," said Slaughter, who recently verbally committed to play at Missouri. "You know, we've got 13- and 14-year-olds who will be playing against 18-year-olds and that doesn't happen in AAU ball.
   
 "You play against kids your own age, but our younger players have so much experience and talent that they're going to be fine playing against the older kids because they know how to play the game and won't be intimidated."
   
 Clyman agreed.
   
 "It took me a while to get used to playing against bigger, stronger players," the sophomore center said, "but we play as a team, and everyone has a role, and we got so much stronger as the season went on. We were a different team, a better team, at the end of the season."
   
 And that's what Draper believes will happen this season.
   
 "You want to be swinging the biggest stick at the end of the season," Draper said, "and I think that's what this team will be doing. I can't wait."

Our family is best described as the U.N. “Brady Bunch” with our Chinese dad, Jewish mom, Black godmom and godsister under one roof (and then came our five adopted sisters from China).
 We grew up hearing Jojo’s stories as a little girl in segregated South Carolina in the 1950s. “You know Amo, when I was your age walking down the street, I would lower my eyes and step to the side or even off the sidewalk completely when a white person was approaching.” I came to learn about Jim Crow through the experience of a little Black girl — the woman who helped raise me. I remember being confounded when Jojo described such blatant racism as completely normal and unquestioned. It was a matter of “proper” manners — the deference and subjugation that was expected of Black people.
 Something as simple as walking down the street, was not simple at all.
 I remember holding Jojo’s hand and searching her eyes as she recounted these stories, so many stories. I cherished Jojo, loved her smooth dark skin that I kissed, her kinky hair that I twisted. I learned to live with the knowledge and the fear that her existence and presence was under assault. I felt the stirring humiliation, and my own powerlessness to go back in time and protect her and my focus sharpened on the injustice of racism.
 When I bloomed into a teenager and felt the gaze of men, and with it my own vulnerability walking alone on the streets. Jojo shared another story, it was late at night and she was alone on an empty street. She heard footsteps behind her. Alert and well aware, she paused and turned around.
 She waited for the stranger to catch up with her and said to the man, “Would you like to walk together? I’ll be safer with you beside me. Isn’t that right?” In my pointed teenage way I pressed her, what if he was a racist, murderer, rapist? “Amo what if he was? He could have been all of those things and he could have killed me, raped me, assaulted me — maybe he was planning to. I invited him to walk with me. I gave him a chance to keep me safe — for us to know each other and keep each other safe. He might have been scared walking down the street alone too.”
 Jojo taught me how to walk the road together.
 On Monday night our council adopted a resolution declaring that Black Lives Matter which I am proud to have co-authored. It is a statement of our values, not an endorsement of a movement or political organization. It is the voice of a coalition of Black leaders, faith leaders, our police chief and police officers’ association. San Mateans from different backgrounds and perspectives who came together in earnest to present a unified front against police brutality and racism. This resolution is the result of complex discourse and courageous emotional and spiritual reflection that stretched us all. It was a multi-layered process of listening to and learning from each other and ultimately finding consensus on our common language and values.
 What will give these words meaning are the actions and outcomes that our community must continue to hold us accountable to. This resolution is the beginning of a long road that we will walk together to uphold and protect the dignity of all San Mateans.

Much of these advances are tied to new superfast 5G wireless technology, which promises internet connections as much as 100 times speedier than what our smartphones get today. It's also more reliable and responsive, thanks to lower latency, a term to describe the lag time for data to go from a handset to a cell tower, then the internet, and back again. 5G promises to reduce latency from 20 milliseconds today to as little as 1 millisecond with 5G, or about the time it takes for a flash of a camera. Between those two changes alone, you could potentially download an entire television series from the internet in seconds.
 5G won't just change the way we watch TV though. Within a few years, it's expected to do things like allow doctors to perform surgeries by controlling a robot from thousands of miles away. 5G is also expected to boost technologies like self-driving cars, which need to not only sense the world around them, but also communicate with each other and internet networks to trace their route and identify any hazards along the way.
 And in entertainment, VR companies such as Facebook's Oculus division and game developers such as Microsoft say they're experimenting with creating bigger worlds, full of details that would be too visually taxing for today's devices to display.
 "It's about unlocking all that potential," said Marija Radulovic-Nastic, senior vice president of development technology and services at game maker Electronic Arts. "We envision the future where games offer immersive experiences, where they offer living, breathing worlds -- worlds that feel dynamic and personalized."
 5G could make that kind of interactive entertainment commonplace, regardless of the device you're using. It would improve a technology called cloud gaming, which allows people to play games on a superpowerful server, streamed to their home like we watch Netflix, and HBO Max and Disney Plus today. In time, people may not need a large, heavy video game console plugged in to their TV to power their games and VR headsets. Instead, gamers will be able to effectively rent powerful computers from the likes of Sony, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia and Amazon.
 The types of games EA makes could change as a result of this technology too, Radulovic-Nastic said, relying on the processing power from cloud providers to do everything from creating smarter artificial intelligence bad guys to fight against, to more-lush locales for players to explore.

German chocolate bar maker Ritter Sport on Thursday won a decade-long battle against US-owned Milka, with the European country's highest court ruling that its trademark on the iconic square packaging stands.
 Marketed as "square, practical, good", Ritter Sport's chocolates are packed in a plastic folio with two openings along the sides and an opening running down the back, a design that it had patented in 1996 and in 2001.
 But Milka, owned by US confectionery giant Mondelez, has challenged Ritter Sport's exclusivity in marketing square chocolate bars.
 Although Milka won an initial challenge in 2016, Ritter Sport had been undeterred in its fight.
 On Thursday, it took the final round as Germany's Federal Court of Justice found that the patent on the square package could be scrapped only if it provided "an essential value" to the product.
 "On the basis of findings by the Federal Patents Court, the square shape of the packaging has no particular artistic value and does not lead to significant price differences with similar products," the court said.
 "It may be that the consumer buys the chocolate because the square shape of the packaging gives the consumer an indication that the chocolate originates from a specific company and therefore links that to specific quality. But that is not the point.
 "The shape of a product or packaging can only be excluded from trademark protection ... if it gives significant value to the product," added the court.

"It's easy to say you don't need to send an officer to a type of call because it didn't result in a report," Casaday said of the AH Datalytics report. "But those reports don't say if the call went bad or turned into something else. Policing is dynamic, and even when a call seems safe, it can quickly turn dangerous."

I have always played a year or two ahead and I think that has made all the difference in the way I play football. Before I was given my place on the team I would go to the odd senior training and sit on the bench at games seeing how the older girls played and learned like that. After getting my position I would listen to the directions of the older girls and the coaches and followed the game that way until I learned my own style of football. Although we have been unlucky in the last couple of years with the outcome in finals, we continue to grow and develop as a team and have a few younger players joining us this year willing to learn in the same way I did. In Mullinalaghta we are always encouraged to take the chances when we get them and not being afraid of making mistakes and because of that advice it gives me more confidence when playing.

Faced with a structural deficit made worse by the pandemic, San Bruno officials are hoping a proposed hotel tax rate hike will improve the city’s financial footing.
 The San Bruno City Council supported moving ahead with a transient occupancy, or hotel, tax increase from 12% to 14% during a study session Tuesday, July 14.
 No decision was made at the meeting, but officials favored bringing the proposal back for action at a future meeting which will allow them to approve floating it to the fall ballot.
 The hotel tax hike is proposed alongside a potential cannabis business tax which officials claim could help generate revenue needed to help close a budget gap worth an estimated $8.2 million.
 Officials said the city’s budget was limited before the pandemic hit, with spending outpacing income to the tune of about $4.2 million and the economic devastation brought with COVID-19 cost the city an additional $4 million.
 While officials have expressed interest in cutting spending and seeking more budget efficiencies to further reduce the deficit, Finance Director Keith DeMartini projected the hotel tax increase could generate an additional $375,000 annually.
 That estimation is down by about $125,000 from initial projections, before the pandemic constrained travel patterns. DeMartini said overnight stays in San Bruno hotel rooms are down 40% from the year prior.
 Councilwoman Laura Davis acknowledged the hardships facing the hospitality industry.
 “It’s difficult. It’s an extremely challenging time and I don’t see the economy turning around for a while. So I can imagine how they feel,” she said of the city’s hoteliers.
 City Manager Jovan Grogan said officials met hoteliers to gauge their opinion on the proposed revenue measure, as well as the state of the industry. In recognition of some concerns raised, San Bruno officials are proposing to phase in the tax incrementally. If it is approved, the tax would increase by 1% annually.
 Officials noted San Bruno’s hotel tax rate is comparable to many other local cities, while also recognizing that San Mateo is considering a similar rate hike on the fall ballot.
 Vice Mayor Michael Salazar said he is anticipating there could be other regional or state taxes on the coming ballot alongside San Bruno’s initiatives too, and questioned whether that could jeopardize voter support.
 “We are making the decision that we think is right for our fiscal reality and hope voters recognize that,” responded Grogan.
 The perspective seemed to satisfy Salazar, who subsequently expressed his support for the measure.
 “If staff is saying they still feel confident, then I’m OK with moving forward,” he said.
 The measure would need a simple majority of voter support to pass. Previous polling suggested that about 60% of voters are comfortable with the tax proposal.
 Officials are also advancing toward floating a cannabis business tax on the fall ballot, but details of the initiative are still up in the air. Councilmembers support establishing fees for cannabis companies, but have not made any decision on what sorts of businesses may be allowed to operate in San Bruno should the tax pass.
 For his part, Grogan characterized the various tax initiatives alongside the other proposed budget balancing strategies as a collective effort to make the city’s finances more sustainable.
 He noted methods are required because no one single approach is likely sufficient to close the gap.
 “There is no silver bullet,” he said.

"Over the past three months, the same argument over safety has been systematically used by Italian authorities to detain four NGO ships," Frederic Penard, director of operations at the organisation, said in the statement.
 "Why wasn't safety more of a concern to maritime authorities when, earlier this month, the Ocean Viking had to wait 11 days for a port to be assigned?"
 The migrants -- mainly from Bangladesh, Eritrea, North Africa and Pakistan -- were picked up in four separate rescues in the Mediterranean on June 25 and 30.
 Their disembarkment initially came as a relief, after a tense few days on the ship marked by migrants jumping overboard, a suicide attempt and bouts of violence.
 The Ocean Viking resumed rescue operations on June 22 after a three-month halt because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 More than 100,000 migrants tried to cross the Mediterranean last year with more than 1,200 dying in the attempt, according to the International Organization for Migration.
 The arrival of summer and more favourable conditions at sea may lead to an increase in attempts to cross the Mediterranean with the hope of arriving in Europe.
 According to Italian news agency ANSA, customs officials rescued 90 migrants off the island of Lampedusa on Wednesday.

At Verizon's research labs, that search to find what's next has led to experiments with streaming detailed images of dinosaurs over 5G and into a headset, just to see what happens.
 In practical terms, it could mean that within a decade, we may be wearing glasses that give us directions to the items on our shopping list while we weave through the grocery store.
 The result could lead people to regularly stream so much data to their devices, it'll be like they're watching superhigh-definition movies all the time. "This will come down to 5G getting to scale," said T.J. Vitolo, director for AR and VR development at Verizon.
 But once 5G becomes the norm, Vitolo believes, tech companies will create a new level of immersion through technologies such as volumetric video. The video created with that technology uses multiple cameras at different angles, sending massive amounts of data over the internet, which ultimately allows you as the viewer to go nearly anywhere the cameras can see.
 For example, instead of watching a football game on TV, he said, VR could plop you into the best seat on the sidelines, next to the coach or right where all the players are. "Imagine being able to be anywhere in the stadium -- you can even be the football," he said.
 It also means that when it's time for my son or daughter to maybe one day take a VR video of their children's first steps, I'll be able to put on a headset and watch as they move, and then join in the celebratory hug after.
