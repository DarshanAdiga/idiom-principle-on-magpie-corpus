 The gigantic gap in venture funding for women and people of color is a bigger, systemic problem. Pointing fingers at existing capital providers won’t solve it.

 She added that passage of a constitutional amendment to allow casino gambling would provide new revenue to K-12 education, though she personally did not state a position on the issue. It’s up to the voters to decide, Hester said.

SEOUL - Asia is home to many exemplars of small but effective government, countries where sound policies and strong institutions underpin economic stability and robust growth. But during the COVID-19 crisis, many are pursuing expansive macroeconomic interventions and implementing measures that infringe on privacy. They are perched on the edge of a slippery slope.
 To be sure, extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the deepest global recession since World War II, with the International Monetary Fund predicting a 5 percent economic contraction in 2020 and a slow recovery after that. An “L-shaped” depression is a very real possibility.

Radical far-left organizations similar to the MFF operate across the country, raising money to bail out criminals, rioters, and protesters who otherwise would be behind bars. While cash bail may not be a perfect policy, allowing groups such as the Minnesota Freedom Fund and others like it to bail out violent criminals is certainly not wise, either.

Cash bail seeks to ensure a criminal defendant returns to a trial or court hearing by imposing a financial fee in order to be set free from jail. In certain circumstances, a defendant’s cash bail can be incredibly costly, while in others minimal, depending on the crime and jurisdiction. Judges and prosecutors may also choose to entirely waive a cash bail fee for certain defendants. In most cases, however, a cash bail is set, and the defendant can either pay the amount to be released until his court date or remain in jail until he sees a judge.
