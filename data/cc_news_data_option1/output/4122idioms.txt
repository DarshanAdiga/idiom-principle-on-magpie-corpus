This power imbalance, as the pandemic revealed, has allowed corporations to bend the rules of business in ways that inordinately disfavor suppliers and protect themselves. The ECCHR report examined the unethical contracts that underpinned the cancellations. In the case of Kohl’s and Arcadia Group, the contracts with suppliers included language allowing brands to cancel without payment for a host of reasons. Arcadia Group’s contract permits canceling orders without payment _for any reason_ , the report found. Other companies, including Urban Outfitters, used _force majeure,_ or act of God clauses, to wiggle out of their deals, even though many had the money to pay. As the ECCHR notes, the canceled orders, no matter what unethical and one-sided contracts exist between brands and factories, are likely in violation of both the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. And thus contracts must be reformed moving forward.

Plaintiffs, including the National Urban League, several jurisdictions and other groups, contend that a shortened timeline would result in an undercount of harder-to-count populations, including immigrants, minorities and lower- income groups, depriving them of funding and representation.
 After the 9th Circuit's affirmation of part of U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh's ruling that the count should continue, the Trump administration went to the Supreme Court. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall said Koh's ruling "exacerbates the serious risk" that the Census Bureau will not be able to deliver the data by the Dec. 31 statutory deadline.
 Wall said the court should not worry that the count is incomplete, saying, "The district court disregarded the Bureau's successful efforts to ensure that the 2020 census will reach levels of accuracy and completeness comparable to other recent censuses while still meeting the deadline."
 Census experts and plaintiffs have said they are concerned that some households were counted inaccurately to reach the completion rate goals, citing enumerators and supervisors across the country who said they were told to cut corners and skip steps in the rush to bring all states to a 99% completion rate.
 "As defendants' own data shows, millions of Americans have now been counted only because of the district court's injunction," said the Urban League response to the government suit filed by lawyer Melissa Arbus Sherry.
 "And critical field work is ongoing, especially for those in hard-to-count populations. Any stay would allow defendants to stop the 2020 Census count, shut down field operations, fire hundreds of thousands of employees, and start processing data the very next day. There is no going back from that."
 Congress could still approve a change to the statutory deadline. A House coronavirus relief bill approved the change, and a bipartisan group of senators has come out in support of it.
