The nameless, faceless boss hiding behind closed doors in Kitty Green’s exceptional _The Assistant_ can be easily read as a Harvey Weinstein stand-in. The truth is that Harvey Weinstein isn’t or, now that he’s in prison, _wasn’t_ the only man in the film industry with a habit of abusing his position and privilege by preying on women in his office, either through coercion or through brute force, he is, or was, the most notorious of them. So yes, _The Assistant_ can be thought of as “the Harvey Weinstein movie,” but it really should be thought of as the best contemporary movie to act out patriarchal rape culture dynamics on screen.

There’s young love, and then there’s love that blooms _too_ young. Rashaad Ernesto Green’s sophomore feature focuses on the latter, one that shapes futures and strains hearts. _Premature_ is about love happening to two people before either is ready, about the euphoric high of their first kiss descending over the course of 90 minutes into the nearly cataclysmic low of decisions made on impulse and under duress. It’s a gorgeous, shattering film, unapologetically real about a number of very real subjects, plot-agnostic but driven by character, consequence and compassion. Green co-wrote _Premature_ with his lead, Zora Howard. Her performance isn’t effortless, it’s effort- conscious: playing Ayanna, a 17-year-old woman balancing her college aspirations and an unexpected summer romance with 20-something NYC transplant Isaiah (Joshua Boone), demands soul-searching. Howard agonizes quietly and internally with the opportunities left for Ayanna to take or leave. But as much as Howard and Boone project maturity, and Green’s filmmaking constructs an illusion of experience around them, they’re still functionally kids. Ayanna recites her poetry in voiceover at intervals throughout the film, each monologue demonstrating her gradual, painful growth. In turn, Green and cinematographer Laura Valladao emphasize an aesthetic that tends toward the palliative. _Premature_ ’s naturalism has the effect of sanding its edges; the film doesn’t keep reality’s creeping dread out of the picture entirely, but instead pushes it to the margins, where a shifting landscape in Harlem and Black American anxieties hover patiently. High stakes to put on first love, but first love doesn’t happen in a vacuum. _—Andy Crump_

John Bolton's new book, "The Room Where it Happened," is a betrayal of the trust Donald Trump placed in him as an adviser and confident. The book in hardback copy sells for $32.50. Judas betrayed Christ for 30 pieces of silver and then hanged himself. I doubt that Bolton plans to hang himself, but he has already hanged himself figuratively, since neither Democrats nor Republicans seem to put much credence in the book's veracity.
   
 Without a doubt, the Democrats (Socialists) would have dearly loved to have had the book when they impeached the president. Indeed, it would have been an ideal complement to the fictions they created in their attempt to overthrow the president; however, it is doubtful that the testimony they may have received from Bolton would have been of much value. I suspect that he would have invoked the Fifth Amendment numerous times if he had been subpoenaed because to swear under oath that his testimony was true would have caused him to perjure himself, and he is too smart for that.
   
 Instead, Bolton laid the groundwork for the future "landslide sales" of his tell-all accusations. If such were his intent, I'm afraid that he misjudged this potential customer's interest. I would much rather spend $32.50 for a more interesting book, such as a good biography or a good novel. However, to be candid, I haven't read the book. My knowledge of its content is only that of TV interviews and various excerpts read by analysts. That is enough!
   
 In many ways, Bolton is a tragic figure. His desperate attempt to justify his actions by insinuating that the country would be in much better shape if the president had followed his advice (mainly to go to war with our enemies) reveals a man who sees himself as a guru of extreme national importance, one who should be president instead of the present candidates. To emphasize his importance to the country, he will vote for neither Biden nor Trump and will instead write in a candidate having his conservative values (a never Trumper). We will never know, but I would wager that he will write his own name on the ballot.
   
 One wonders why a man who once enjoyed the highest esteem among the conservative powers in Washington D.C., has chosen to cast that reputation aside. Some pundits surmise that Bolton was so disgruntled with Trump's failure to give him the political position which he coveted as well as Trump's failure to recognize his brilliance, in fact, even ignoring his advice, that he grumpily determined to make sure Trump would be discredited as a credible second-term president. Never mind the fact that Trump, although crudely at times, has already proved himself to be quite capable of running a country, a stark contrast to the previous administration which was more interested in transforming America than in governing it, an administration in which the present Democrat presidential candidate was an integral part.
   
 Disgruntled people seldom approach their decisions with logic. (Note the present-day Democratic Socialists who believe that socialism is superior to capitalism as a national political philosophy notwithstanding all evidence to the contrary.) Accordingly, Bolton has emerged, not as a memorable figure who brought down a president, but as a comic figure who brought himself down instead. This book, then, has the elements of a true drama, containing both tragedy and comedy centered on its author.
   
 I suppose in the grand scheme of things the book is appropriate for its time. If the book had been released during the grand inquisition of Trump's impeachment, and a Bolton subpoena to appear before the inquisition had been issued, the unverifiable events, verified only by statements, such as "In my opinion" and "It seemed to me" would have left more egg on the faces of Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler, and Nancy Pelosi, all of whom had enough egg on their faces anyway from their impeachment debacle.
   
 On the other hand, more egg on their faces would have been im-peachy. Sorry! That coined description is a whimsical joke, a bad joke at that, but appropriate, I think, in light of the new face of the Democrat Party whose only agenda is to destroy today's America and create a new one. As the leader of the Black Lives Matter movement in New York City told us, and I paraphrase: We are peaceful protesters, but if we don't get our way, we will burn down America. Now, that statement is a genuine political philosophy, a statement of anarchy, a devastating statement it is true; but, at least, it has more substance than did "The Room Where It Happened."
   
 It is too bad that Bolton didn't close the door to the room when he left.

Songs of the soul flow from the drunken mouths of the jukebox-loving inebriates in _Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets_. The Ross brothers have created a prototype barroom experience: It is closing night for the fictionalized Roaring 20’s in Las Vegas, a real bar actually operating in their home base of New Orleans, and the regulars, led by local professional actor Michael Martin and otherwise populated with true bar-frequenting non-actors, have come together to kiss their favorite watering hole goodbye. Its much-discussed fictional framework is merely that—a framework—beneath which legitimate human interactions play out, with characters representing themselves and actually drinking the night away. There is authentic war vet commiseration and romantic longing, bartender-led singalongs and, inevitably, one guy trying to fight another “with eyes tattooed on his eyelids.” The holy trinity of dive bar life—despondency, frivolity and pugnacity—is present and spiritually enriching.

 We would be remiss if we didn't pause in the middle of all the seemingly urgent stuff going on to recognize something tremendously important that people could have missed.
   
 It involves the recognition of a true hero, a person who has built an impressive record of achievement and someone who has never forgotten her Amarillo roots. Likewise, the city has not forgotten her, nor are they likely to in the near future as she is expected to direct the next moon landing.
   
 During Tuesday's virtual City Council meeting, the group recognized Holly Ridings with a proclamation and a key. Now, we know what you might be thinking. A key to the city? Not quite. Ridings, who is the first woman to serve as chief flight director at NASA, was presented with a key to the "moon and beyond." The rest of the inscription on the key reads: "Taking us from Olsen Elementary to out of this world. Amarillo is proud of you!"
   
 For those who may not know, Ridings grew up in Amarillo, attending Olsen and then Crockett Middle School before graduating from Tascosa High School, which inducted her into its hall of fame during ceremonies last year. Ridings, who still has family in Amarillo, has been a steadfast goodwill ambassador for the city.
   
 Her career path began to come into view in 1986, when as a sixth-grader, she watched with the rest of the nation as the Challenger space shuttle tragedy unfolded in real time on television. In an interview with Air and Space magazine in its June edition, she epiphany represented by that moment would inform her life for years to come. She loved space and problem-solving and knew what she wanted to do with her life.
   
 "Who would have imagined that a tragedy in 1986 (the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger) would cause a sixth-grade student to set a course for her life's work?" said Amarillo City Council member Howard Smith, a long-time friend of the family. "But having known Holly for years, it is easy to believe that she would become a problem solver. Her ability to aim high has been a pattern all of her life."
   
 Of course, Ridings wasn't through in Amarillo. She was part of Tascosa's state championship basketball team in the early 1990s and was named to the all- tournament team as a forward for the Lady Rebels.
   
 After earning a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Texas A&M;, she joined NASA in 1998. Her career there began as a flight controller in the thermal operations group, according to the NASA news release announcing her most recent appointment. Now, she will lead the group directing human spaceflight missions from Mission Control Center at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   
 Named to her new role in September 2018, she will lead a group of 32 active flight directors and flight directors-in-training, including integrating American-made commercial crew spacecraft into the fleet of vehicles servicing the orbiting laboratory, and Orion spacecraft missions to the moon and beyond. For context, think about the Tom Hanks movie "Apollo 13" and the role of NASA legend Gene Kranz as played by Ed Harris.
   
 In other words, this is a big deal.
   
 Her selection was announced by NASA Director of Flight Operations Brian Kelley. "Holly has proven herself a leader among a group of highly talented flight directors," he said. "I know she will excel in this unique and critical leadership position providing direction for the safety and success of human spaceflight missions. She will lead the team during exciting times as they adapt to support future missions with commercial partners and beyond low-Earth orbit."
   
 Her career path at NASA has seen a steady upward trajectory since being named a flight director in 2005. Highlights include serving as the lead flight director for missions including International Space Station Expedition 16 in 2007-08, the space shuttle program mission STS-127 in 2009 and the first SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft mission to the space station in 2012.
   
 "From classroom to Camp Fire programs to athletics, she just sets her goals and the rest is history," Smith said. "Some of that history at NASA is yet to be written. I have no doubt that Holly will help write it."
   
 The official proclamation includes recognition of her "outstanding qualities of leadership and dedication. We acknowledge her exceptional service to this nation and NASA's space program. The City of Amarillo, Texas, recognizes your accomplishments and celebrates our Hometown Hero for making a difference in being a role model for so many. We are Amarillo proud!"
   
 So are we. We salute Holly Ridings and congratulate her on all of her achievements. She is not only a great role model for young women (although she certainly is that). She is a great role model, period.

If Josh Boone’s _The Fault in Our Stars_ had several drug addictions, plus an overwhelming need for family therapy, it’d read like distant kin to _Babyteeth_ , Australian filmmaker Shannon Murphy’s feature debut. _Babyteeth_ files under the “sick teenager” romantic dramedy sub-genre, being the story of Milla Finlay (Eliza Scanlen), a high school student struggling through youth with cancer while living with her overmedicated basket case mom, Anna (Essie Davis), and her emotionally remote psychiatrist dad, Henry (Ben Mendelsohn). Add into that dynamic the arrival of Moses (Toby Wallace), who parts the Finlay’s woes with all the grace of a caroming meteor. _Babyteeth_ orbits the danger baked into Milla’s infatuation with Moses, which of course blooms into genuine fancy between them. He’s chaos incarnate with a rat tail and a face tattoo, but he clearly digs her, so she digs him back. The feelings that each has for the other are so baldly recognizable that Anna and Henry reluctantly allow the courtship to progress. “This is the worst possible parenting I can imagine,” Anna opines, one of the many acerbic punchlines given to her by Rita Kalnejais’ screenplay, each delivered with wide-eyed, deadpanned resignation. The dueling complications and contradictions of _Babyteeth_ ’s narrative make up its greatest treasures, captured with the marriage of naturalism to dreamlike aesthetics. One easy way to interpret the movie’s airy atmosphere is as a mirror of the characters’ stupefaction, whether pharmaceutical or spiritual. By the end, as Scanlen’s performance gains exponential clarity and power, that breezy quality connotes gentle acceptance. It’s a reflection of how people gradually learn to let go. _—Andy Crump_

Kelly Reichardt’s Oregonian ode to the human desire for comfort and friendship takes us back to the territory during the mid-19th century, when the economy of beaver pelts and gold rush hopefuls brought waves of migration to the area. A baker from Maryland, Otis “Cookie” Figowitz (John Magaro), finds himself amid a hostile group of fur trappers on the way to Oregon when he runs into King Lu (Orion Lee), a Chinese immigrant fresh on the run from scorned Russians. A fraternal bond between the two quickly materializes, and when a coveted dairy cow is brought to the territory by an English nobleman known as Chief Factor (Toby Jones), King Lu immediately recognizes that fresh milk combined with Cookie’s baking expertise could give the duo a unique trade in an area where the predominant sweet is a bland concoction of water and flour crackers. And so, in the dead of night, King Lu and Cookie leave the small shack they share with a metal pail in hand, sneaking through the pasture until they reach the dairy cow. Reichardt makes no moral judgement on them for stealing; the irony is that Cookie and King Lu’s act of theft is so small compared to the pillaging and exploitation that propelled America into an economic superpower in the first place. _First Cow_ takes place when slavery was the main economic drive of the country, when Native Americans were facing genocide, when women were second-class citizens. _First Cow_ will win most viewers over; it is funny in the most earnest way, with the beauty of friendship presented as the foundation of the film. Yet if the film wants to implore us to understand the essence of our species, its portrayal of burgeoning American capitalism is undoubtedly, jarringly, at odds with the nature of mankind. _—Natalia Keogan_

Director Corneliu Porumboiu is no stranger to procedures or regulations, nor insensitive to the ways in which the strictures we impose on ourselves and others end up wrapping us up from within. His previous film, the documentary _Infinite Football_ , allows his friend Laurentiu Ginghina time and cinematic space to explain the many modifications and new rules to enact in order to, he believes, completely revitalize the sport of football—all while exorcising the trauma of post-Communist Romania. The crime drama, then, is a genre particularly suited to Porumboiu’s concerns, and his latest, _The Whistlers_ , appears as much a pulp exercise as a stylish deconstruction of social order in all its forms, from the institutions of justice to the basic tenets of language. In it, laconic, mild-mannered cop Cristi (Vlad Ivanov) navigates an elaborate schema of criminal enterprise and double-crossing police to walk away with a life-changing amount of stolen drug money. The key to much of the film’s convolution can be found on La Gomera, in the Canary Islands, where Cristi learns a native whistling language called _El Silbo_ in order to clandestinely communicate with archetypal folks like Gilda (Catrinel Marlon), the girlfriend of Zsolt (Sabin Tambrea) who owns a mattress warehouse through which he’ll abscond with money stolen from mob boss Paco (Augusti Villaronga), all while avoiding Police Chief Magda (Rodica Lazar), Cristi’s boss and another remnant of Communist Romania left to her own self-serving motivations. Though Porumboiu recalibrates a typical neo-noir plot by playing with chronologies and perspectives, adding a dose of pitch-black humor to leaven the film’s ostensible bleakness—and cinematographer Tudor Mircea’s shots of the Spanish coast are something to behold—rather than amounting to placeholders lost in a twisty plot twisted for the sake of it, Porumboiu’s many players _survive_ the chaos. They are defined by it. We understand who these people are through the ways in which they struggle to escape the system. And by the time we’ve untangled the film’s plot, we’re offered a final moment of catharsis, a sense—after 90 minutes of state-sanctioned violence and depravity—of what freedom feels like. _—Dom Sinacola_
