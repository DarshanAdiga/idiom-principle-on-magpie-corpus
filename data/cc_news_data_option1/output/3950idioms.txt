Over the next few years, other ecologists were beginning to recognize that evolution could happen very quickly. In one classic experiment, scientists put algae and a microscopic grazer into a tank together. At first, there were cycles of boom and bust, but after only a few weeks, the algae evolved defenses that prevented them from being eaten and stopped the large swings in population numbers.

But Danish businessman Thomas Sandgaard has now bought the club, the transfer embargo has been lifted, and Charlton fans are hoping that they can now draw a line under their troubles.
 It has left Bowyer scrambling to bring in new signings before the transfer deadline, although he has added midfielder Ben Watson and forward Marcus Maddison over the last week.
 Parkinson said: "It's been a troubled club really, with relegation last year and then all the takeover talk which seems to have been around Charlton constantly over the last few years.
 "But they have good players and they are a team who will probably be up there at the end of the season, however we have to capitalise on any lack of confidence that is around the place at the moment."
 Parkinson watched Charlton's 2-0 defeat at Lincoln City last Sunday but says Bowyer has used several different systems in the games so far this season, meaning it is difficult to second-guess how they will play tomorrow.
 "They are a bit of an unknown quantity," he said.
 "I saw them play at Lincoln on Sunday when they went with more or less a 4-4-2, but they have gone 4-3-3 previously, and they've used three at the back, so it is difficult to predict what shape they will play and what the personnel is going to be.

Proposition 23 would require a doctor or highly trained nurse at each of the state’s 600 dialysis clinics whenever patients are being treated to improve patient care. It was placed on the ballot by unions that represent health care workers.

“There are a tremendous number of complications that can occur during and around dialysis, and a doctor onsite will be able to respond not only to emergencies such as cardiac arrest, bleeding, dangerous fluctuations in blood pressure — all other common side effects of dialysis — but they also will be able to oversee the overall quality of care,” said Steve Trossman, a spokesman for the Oakland-based Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, which spent more than $6 million in a signature drive to get it on the ballot.

“The motive is to force the dialysis community to spend a bunch of money to defeat it because ultimately this is more about a union organizing battle. I have no doubt that in 2022 there will be another initiative on the ballot targeting dialysis providers and dialysis patients,” said Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for No on Prop. 23, a coalition led by DaVita and Fresenius that also includes the California Medical Association and American Nurses Association-California.

“The intensity of our training has been really good,” Muuss said about practices since the win over Louisville.
 Several players stood out for the Deacons, including defender Garrison Tubbs, a freshman defender from Brunswick, Ga. Tubbs started in place of the injured Michael DeShields at the key defensive spot on the backline. Tubbs also played a lot in their exhibition win over Pittsburgh, so Muuss wasn’t surprised with Tubbs’ showing against Louisville. DeShields suffered a back injury in the game against Pittsburgh.
