 Tomah used its home course advantage to defeat runnerup Waunakee by three strokes. Both teams will advance to next week’s state tournament at Meadow Valleys in Kohler.
 Timberwolves coach Tonya Gnewikow said her team did an excellent job of handling extremely windy conditions that inflated scores across the board. Only one golfer, medalist Lanie Veenedall of New Richmond, broke 80.

  “The save was in the first few minutes and was one of my first few touches of the ball. The cross came in and the striker flung himself towards the ball and managed to get it towards the goal.


  “I flung up a left arm, managed to knock the ball up in the air and go and get the rebound.


  “It was a good one.


  “I’m very happy to do that and contribute to the team.


  “I think it maybe settled us down a little bit in the first half. If we go behind at such an early stage after not playing for so long, it might have been a long, difficult road back into the game from there.

During this past winter, before COVID-19 struck, I went to an auction at Keene Auctions (formerly known as Knotty Pine) in their cool, refurbished warehouse space on Dunbar Street. At the preview before the auction was to start, I spotted several folks I know… mostly antique dealers. My friend, Jane Gallagher, was there. She owns a wicked cool shop in Peterborough called Grove & Main Antiques. She was admiring a big block of wood that, upon closer inspection, was actually made up of several interlocking pieces. It was all in the shape of a hat and it turns out it was the mold, or “block,” on which hats were indeed shaped and created. Hat molds are quite collectible it seems.


  I could tell Jane wanted the mold… bad. So did some of the other dealers in the room. Jane once told me there are no friends at an auction. I knew what she meant. Once you’re registered at an auction, all friendly politeness falls away when the bidding starts and it’s every man for himself. Well, once the hat mold came up, a little bidding war began, and I was aghast at what Jane spent to walk away with the object. I mean, really, what can you actually do with it? You place it somewhere where you can admire it… thinking about our earliest years in manufacturing. How each hat was constructed of felt or straw and molded to a specific size wooden form, stitched and embellished with such craftsmanship that the word “millinery” went from its more broad origins of fashion design to simply the skilled trade of hat making.


  Hats and their making go back to pre-historic times. The word milliner comes from the middle ages derived from the city of Milan in Italy. Milan was known to be the hub of the fashion and textile world, so a milliner was someone who was an inhabitant of Milan or one who deals with items from there, according to Wiki. In "A Brief Overview of the History of Millinery" at hatalk.com, the writer actually made a distinction between two types of hat makers: a milliner was typically a woman who made hats for women, while men's hats were made by men known as hatters. From the turn of the century up to the 1960s, wearing hats was commonplace. Whether rich or poor, people wore hats when leaving the home. I have looked at many antique photos and noticed that even the poorest of folks typically wore hats. Men also wore jackets, even while standing in a bread line at wartime. For me, it evokes a certain civility and genteelness that has eroded over the last handful of decades.

It turns out, Jane’s auction find is known as a puzzle block. Multiple parts could be adjusted for certain fits and styles. I’ve sold a few of the simpler style, which is just a crown and a brim that fits around it. Another article told me these wooden molds used to be covered in fabric and padding to allow the use of pins to hold pieces in place. It makes sense to me, but I only saw it mentioned in that one article.


  Jane’s got a few more in her shop and she sold the puzzle block one she’d paid so dearly for. Items from our industrial manufacturer’s age is very hot right now in the antiques and collectibles world. I think, like me, they appreciate the fine skills involved in the true trades. Interestingly, I found a couple of millinery shops online that sell not just hats but millinery tools. Most are in Europe but two that are in the U.S. are Humboltd Haberdashery (humboldthaberdashery.com) and Judith M. Millinery Supply House (judithm.com).

Pitt announced the addition of Maryland graduate transfer D.J. Turner to this year’s roster back on September 1st. At the time, it was thought that Turner could add some depth and be an extra veteran presence in the wide receivers room, but four games into the season it has become clear Turner is much more than that.


  He has emerged as one of the top playmakers for the Pitt offense right away. Despite a 30-29 loss to North Carolina State over the weekend, Turner earned the honor of being named ACC wide receiver of the week for his performance. In Saturday’s contest he caught 8 passes for 186 yards. He pulled in five 20-plus yard receptions, including a 50-yard pickup in the fourth quarter.


  Turner was set to play this season for Maryland, and in world without COVID, or one where the Big Ten did not delay its season because of the pandemic, that’s exactly where he would be.


  “That was the initial plan, but it kind of just goes to show that I’m here for a reason,” Turner said of his transfer to Pitt. “If there was no initial COVID plans, than I still would have been there.”


  Maryland’s loss has been Pitt’s gain. Turner credits his quick transition from being a late offseason addition to a major factor on offense for his ability to quickly learn the playbook. He has built a strong connection with quarterback Kenny Pickett almost immediately because of it.


  “I feel like I’ve built a certain amount of trust with him and like when I’m in the game he feels comfortable giving me the ball and every opportunity I get I try to make the most of it,” Turner told reporters on Tuesday. “So I feel like that’s where the success comes from.”


  Turner is putting up numbers like he never has before. In his four games with Pitt, Turner has recorded 17 catches for 319 yards and a touchdown. In the previous four years with Maryland, he totaled 294 receiving yards. The fresh start has benefitted Turner as much Pitt.


  “I got plenty of opportunities at Maryland, but not as many as I’m getting here,” he said. “So like I said, every time I get an opportunity to make a play or get a chance to touch the ball I’m going to try to take full advantage of it no matter how it comes, so I feel like that’s probably the biggest thing is just touching the ball a little bit more than usual.”


  Turner showed some resolve between weeks three and four. He had a few dropped passes against Louisville, but bounced back to put up a huge game against North Carolina State. As a veteran, he knows drops are bound to happen with the volume of passing plays Pitt runs each week and he found a way to move onto the next play, something he hopes can rub off on his teammates.


  “With our offense we throw the ball around a lot. There’s going to be drops, and the biggest thing with that is kind of just play the next play,” Turner said.


  Last week’s loss stung for Turner, so picking up the receiver of the week award caught him a little by surprise. He was appreciative of the honor, but knows he left some plays on the field last week and is hoping to improve on that this week heading into Saturday’s game with Boston College.


  “I didn’t realize how many yards I actually had until I got back to the locker room and checked my phone,” Turner explained. “So it definitely got me by surprise a little bit, but there’s still a lot to be done. One more yard and we might have won the game if I would have punched that one catch in on the one-yard line. Still a lot more work to be done.”
