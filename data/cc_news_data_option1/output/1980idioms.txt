WASHINGTON (AP) — As Americans confront a crisis unlike any in modern times, the world’s greatest deliberative body is doing almost anything but deliberate the coronavirus.It's as though the challenge has split the U.S. Senate into two.On one side is a Senate clamoring for a quick response to the virus outbreak at its door. On the other is the wait-and-see Senate hitting pause on swift action and carrying on with non-pandemic business."Every aspect of American society has been changed by this crisis — except, perhaps, the Republican Senate," said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in the chamber Wednesday.The split screen at the Capitol provides a study in contrasts and priorities, one that reflects the partisan differences between Republicans and Democrats, and is defining both ahead of the 2020 election.As the House works remotely, the lights-on Senate has the legislative stage to itself. But despite a virus death toll nearing 100,000 and more than 30 million unemployed, the slow-moving Senate is proving even a pandemic won't quicken its pace. Senators are prepared to leave town for a weeklong Memorial Day break without having acted on any new relief.At least one Republican, Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, vowed to try to prevent the Senate from recessing Thursday unless it votes on more aid to states and cities facing layoffs."Now is not the time for the Senate to go home," tweeted Gardner, who is among the most politically endangered GOP senators running for reelection in the fall. He told reporters at the Capitol that he had called President Donald Trump at the White House with his concerns.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defends the output, arguing that his side of the Capitol led passage of an earlier major aid package that cost $2 trillion. Better to assess how that money is being spent, he said, before approving more. He rejects the new $3 trillion package approved by the Democratic-led House last week as a "liberal wish list."McConnell portrayed the Capitol, where senators in masks are showing up most days while the House works from home, as its own "tale of two chambers.""Over here in the United States Senate, the lights are on, the doors are open, and we are working for the American people," said McConnell, R-Ky. "And across the rotunda, in the House? Crickets."Yet it's the split on display throughout the Senate's side of the Capitol complex — in the Senate chamber, its committee rooms, even its private caucus meetings.The floor action this week revolved around votes on Trump's nominees for judicial and executive branch positions. Senators confirmed a new Federal Election Commission member and is on track to confirm four federal judges. Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe, could be confirmed as soon as Thursday.Across the street in the committee rooms, the split screen was coming into even sharper focus.Two marquee hearings focused on investigations of the Obama administration stemming from the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.The Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday voted to issue a subpoena for its investigation into presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's son Hunter, though there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either of the Bidens. On Thursday, the Judiciary Committee is set to consider issuing a subpoena in the investigation into Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn."This pandemic is the biggest crisis our country has faced since this committee was created," said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a former presidential hopeful, addressing the panel's chairman, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. "You made the decision to force a vote on a purely political matter that will do absolutely nothing for those at risk of contracting COVID-19."Ahead of the meeting, Johnson released a long list of coronavirus- related actions his committee had taken since the start of the year.Even behind closed doors, the differences can be seen and heard.Trump arrived on Capitol Hill for an impromptu visit to the Senate Republican lunch Tuesday that quickly turned to politics. The president touted his own poll numbers and implored his allies to "be tough" as they fight for their jobs this fall. Democrats are seeking to gain the majority and flip control.In contrast, Democratic senators, who no longer meet for lunch but convene by conference call, heard Wednesday from economist Mark Zandi, who warned them of the risks of inaction.Zandi said "Job No. 1" for Congress was sending money "quickly" to state and local governments, according to a Democrat who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity.The economist told them state and local governments are "really teetering on financial edge," the Democrat said. Without aid, hundreds of thousands of more jobs could be lost, he said.Republicans are hopeful that as states reopen, the economy will improve, lessening the need for more federal funds.But polling shows Americans are concerned about a second wave of the virus as shops and workplaces reopen. An AP-NORC poll found 83% of Americans are at least somewhat concerned that lifting restrictions in their area will lead to additional infections, with 54% saying they are very or extremely concerned.___Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

The rule of ‘strict liability’ evolved in the year 1866 in a celebrated English case, Rylands v. Fletcher. The rule provides that a person who brings anything on his land which is likely to cause mischief if it escapes, keeps such thing at his own peril and is at first glance liable for damage which is the natural consequence of such escape. This rule had several limitations. For instance, it is applicable only in case of non-natural use of land. It also does not apply to cases where the hazardous substance escaped due to an act of God or an act of a stranger.

What we need is unambiguous information about what we are expecting people to do. For now, that means sticking with the Stay at Home message in Scotland, reflecting the different position that we are in with the spread of coronavirus here.
 When we are able to start easing lockdown restrictions, we must learn from the innovations we have had to bring in.
 Westminster has managed to set up a robust system enabling MPs to take part in proceedings remotely, including electronic voting, which is secure and efficient.
 I hope it will end the wasteful practice of queueing in a corridor to vote. I want electronic voting to be retained, offering MPs more opportunities to raise constituents’ concerns and hold the UK Government to account.
 It is disappointing that the Tories want to brush these innovations, which drag the outdated and dysfunctional Westminster system kicking and screaming into the 21st century, under the carpet.
 Ongoing social distancing measures here mean we must rethink how we support individuals and businesses.
 I will be visiting small businesses across my constituency, once it is safe for them to reopen, as they need help to recover from this crisis.
 Rates reliefs and the Scottish Government’s Small Business Support Grants are a vital lifeline for local businesses, but they will need us to make considered decisions about how and where we shop once restrictions start to lift.
 Rebalancing the economy towards improving our quality of life must be our priority, if we are to give people the confidence to face a world changed by coronavirus.

There’s a huge gray area when it comes to Esthetician’s and what they (we) can do within their scope of practice, and it varies by state. The amount of hours required to obtain an Esthetics license also varies by state. My concern is that the education and guidelines are not consistent and it needs to be more uniform. Esthetician’s want to keep up with new and trending treatments and the latest devices to hit the market, but at the rate the beauty tech industry is growing, technology is evolving faster than individual state legislation can keep up with. This is leading to even more concern and more unanswered questions when it comes to what procedures Estheticians are allowed to perform legally.

Nach den ersten Teamtrainings seit mehr als zwei Monaten hat die Basketball- Bundesliga einen weiteren Schritt auf dem Weg zum Meisterturnier gemacht.
 Alle Spieler und Betreuer, die schon vor dem vergangenen Wochenende in Deutschland waren, wurden nach Angaben der BBL bei ihren zehn Teams zweimal negativ auf das Coronavirus getestet. Wie diffizil der Plan bleibt, die Saison bis zum 28. Juni mit 35 Partien im Münchner Audi Dome zu Ende zu spielen, zeigt jedoch der positive Befund eines aus dem Ausland einreisenden Spielers. Dieser Profi habe zu keiner Zeit Kontakt zu seinem Team gehabt und wurde isoliert, wie die Liga mitteilte.
 Die Liga sah die erste "Bewährungsprobe" für ihr Hygiene- und Sicherheitskonzept damit als "bestanden" an. Bis das Turnier am 6. Juni mit der Partie zwischen der BG Göttingen und den Hakro Merlins Crailsheim eröffnet wird, bedarf es aber weiter höchster Wachsamkeit. "Jeder Einzelne muss sich in den kommenden sechs Wochen sehr intelligent und diszipliniert verhalten", betonte Marko Pesic, Geschäftsführer von Titelverteidiger FC Bayern München der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. "Ich habe keine Zweifel, dass uns das gelingt."

The Stoughton Fair Board encouraged people to support the youth who had planned to sell their livestock during the meat auction by still purchasing it from them. The money the exhibitors make from selling livestock can go toward feed bills, college funds or other fair projects, the post states.
 The fair board’s announcement included a concession to students who were expecting to age out this year. They will be allowed to show in 2021, the post states.
 The board said nothing has been as challenging as making this decision.
 “We hope to never be faced with this again,” the post stated. “We would like to wish everyone the most enjoyable summer possible. Get outside as much as possible and stay healthy and safe. We look forward to seeing all of you next year.”
 The announcement was unsurprising to many in light of continued restrictions on gatherings, but Dybevik, the board’s former president, said the board has been debating the options for a month and has been discussing its options with Public Health Madison Dane County during that time.
 “The biggest thing about the fair is it brings everybody together,” Dybevik told the Hub. “And with so many things unknown – as far as what policy would be – we couldn’t make that decision in good faith.”
 He said the board made the decision before the county announced its new guidelines on reopening. He said that made the decision easier, but part of the justification was that there was no feasible way to postpone it until later in the summer, considering the costs for the carnival, rodeo and other acts.
 “Our fair is one of the first of the season, and unfortunately we are under time constraints,” Dybevik said. “We couldn’t possibly risk putting on a fair that nobody is going to come to, that wouldn’t make sense for us or our vendors.”

Ramnagar (West Bengal) [India], May 21 (ANI): West Bengal is one of the worst affected as Cyclone Amphan made landfall along the eastern coast of India on Wednesday.   Some villages along the coastal states of Odisha and West Bengal have been the worst affected.   East Midnapore district in West Bengal had to bear the brunt of the natural disaster despite authorities taking several precautionary measures to mitigate the impact of the landfall.   Several residents of Ramnagar 1 Panchayat and Digha in the district had to be shifted to a cyclone shelter.   Authorities are tasked with double challenges as the country is already reeling under the coronavirus crisis. Those evacuated had to ensure they wear face masks and maintain social distancing.   Arrangements were also made for food and bedding.   Cyclone Amphan, one of the worst storms over the Bay of Bengal, pounded the two states on May 20. (ANI)
