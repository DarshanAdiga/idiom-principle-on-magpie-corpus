Looking to unseat Coghill is Robert Myers, who hails from North Pole. Myers was born and raised in Salcha in 1983 and eventually moved to Fairbanks, where he graduated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
 While at college in 2007, Myers interned with Rep. Peggy Wilson of Wrangell in the House, which is where his interest in politics was sparked.
 Myers paid the bills by driving buses for a while before finishing college. Now he drives trucks for a living, with Prudhoe Bay as his primary run. He got married in 2011 and has been living in North Pole with his wife and three daughters since 2017.
 “I enjoyed politics. I thought in the back of my head it was something I’d get involved with later in my life,” he said. “I tried to get into a little bit of that after my internship. I didn’t get very far with it and just thought, ‘Well, it’ll happen later.’
 “But everything that’s happened this last five years has pushed me this way slowly,” he continued. “I was very unhappy when Governor Walker cut the PFD.”
 Myers said that, after Gov. Mike Dunleavy was elected, he thought things would change.
 “And then I just saw all the fighting between him and the Republican legislators,” he said. “At that point I thought, well, I need to do something here.”
 Myers sent his concerns to a number of Republican legislators but was unsatisfied with their responses.
 “If nobody else is going to do it, somebody has to. I have to try. If nobody else is going to make the changes, I have to try,” he said.
 Myers believes that the PFD “should continue to be paid according to the 1982 statute” and said he supports amending the state Constitution to protect it.
 “The state already gets 75% of the royalties. They haven’t really shown an ability to live within those means. They’ve spent all our savings,” he said. “Really what the PFD comes down to, more that anything else, is ownership. Is the oil owned by the state or is the oil owned by the people?”
 Myers said permanent fund earnings should be used first and foremost for a dividend rather than paying for government. The state, he said, should be spending less.
 When it comes to revenue, Myers said he doesn’t support implementing a broad- based tax. If it became necessary, though, he would consider a “flat income tax” but only as a replacement for other revenue, like the state’s use of the permanent fund earnings for government spending. He sees a sales tax as regressive and believes oil taxes are becoming less viable.
 “The only one that I’m even entertaining the possibility of is a flat income tax. The other possibilities, I just don’t see them as viable. I don’t see crazy oil taxes as viable, partly because I’m concerned about how this will affect future production,” he said. “We’ve always relied on the oil industry, so raising oil taxes to me is doubling down on a losing strategy.”
 Myers’ frustrations with state spending have only been exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He said that after the state spent years spending its savings, here’s a ripe example of exactly the crisis that the savings should have been preserved for.
 Overall, however, Myers thinks the state’s response has been adequate. He sees mandates and other government control as a risk to personal freedom and is more concerned about the mental health impacts on individuals.
 “What I’m concerned with balancing out the COVID response is not just the economy but how it’s affecting people in the long run,” he said. “What we’re seeing across the country is a huge spike in suicide. With people stuck at home, they can get into issues with substance problems, they’re losing their livelihoods.”
