Hi, thanks. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe a two-parter on the COVID vaccine related activity. I'm wondering if you could clarify whether the -- Wetteny, to your point on the take-or-pay arrangements, should we think about those as roughly paralleling what the government stockpiling orders might look like?

Yes. Hi, good morning. Can you just kind of guide us to how should we think about the cadence of earnings in fiscal year '21? And when we think about the high and low end of the guidance range, it's broader than historically, considering that there is no upside or that there is optionality associated with the vaccine and that there is more visibility associated with the pay and play. What are you factoring into low-end of the guidance versus high-end of the guidance?

If you separate out and look at organic execution across the business, in Biologics, I would say margins were slightly negative to the tune of about 30 basis points, and that's largely due to component sourcing that we are seeing, so to increase in the business as we execute on larger programs, commercial programs.

At our Anagni facility, we dedicated two vial lines at the site to drug product capacity for COVID-19 vaccine candidates for both AstraZeneca and J&J. We've accelerated the rapid scale-up of capacity to support the potential launch and round the clock manufacturing schedules for these vaccine candidates should either be approved.

And then things get weird. The compressed air then enters an intake distribution manifold that straddles the turbo like a giant tarantula. Eight runners connect to the inner faces of the valve covers, where they seemingly disappear. It takes a cutaway model to see that the valve covers themselves have secret passages cast inside them (four each) that extend the runners and direct the compressed intake air over the top of the heads to hidden outboard intake ports. Forget Yarnell Grade; this is the work of a mad scientist.

Towing is a big part of the Super Duty's capabilities, and the new 6.7-liter diesel will likely be the engine of choice. Even when lugging a 10,000-pound trailer up a steep grade, the diesel climbs with ease -- never laboring or hunting among gears. Drivers may also selectively lock out higher gears to ensure optimal towing prowess. Descending is also made simple thanks to a well-managed automatic transmission that seems to select just the right gear at the right time.
 ## Interior
 Most of the 2011 Ford F-350 Super Duty's interior carries over from the previous model, featuring a blocky, industrial theme. Compared to the Ram 3500, the Ford's cabin is beginning to look a little long in the tooth (though the updated climate controls are welcome). Hard plastics abound throughout the interior on lower trim levels, but are on par or better than other trucks in this segment. Opting for the Lariat or King Ranch models will add a decidedly upscale experience, with rich leather and added amenities.

Tried getting with Crystal from Diesel Stop Forum and she referred my case to Jessica Johnson, Regional Customer Service Manager. Jessica says she'll get back to me after the holidays (6th), until then I guess I should hitchhike, walk, bike or something else...but not drive my $65K pickup. Jessica did make it clear that Ford doesn't pick up the tab, they may offer some assistance.
