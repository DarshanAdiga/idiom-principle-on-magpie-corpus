US Judge Alvin Hellerstein issued the ruling during a tele-hearing on Thursday.
 He said that Cohen's return to jail was "retaliatory because of his desire to exercise his First Amendment rights to publish a book and to discuss anything about the book or anything else he wants on social media and with others".
 The Manhattan judge added that, in 21 years on the bench, he had never seen such a provision for a prisoner. "How can I take any other inference but that it was retaliatory?"
 Cohen was re-arrested on 9 July - days after he tweeted that he was "close to completion" of his tell-all book relating to the president. The book reportedly details alleged racist comments made by Mr Trump.
 This week, Cohen had sued US Attorney General William Barr and the prison bureau director over the so-called "gag order".
       * Ex-Trump lawyer sues government over 'gag order'
 The suit, brought by Cohen's attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), claimed that Cohen's re-jailing over the order violated his constitutional right to free speech.
 According to court filings, Cohen's book would provide "graphic and unflattering details about the President's behaviour behind closed doors", including descriptions of his "pointedly anti-Semitic remarks and virulently racist remarks" against former President Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela.
 The White House has not yet commented on these allegations.
 Prosecutors on Wednesday argued that Cohen had been combative during the discussion and took issue with nearly all aspects of the home confinement agreement, US media report.
 The judge has ordered prosecutors and Cohen to renegotiate his confinement terms within a week.
 Cohen has temporarily agreed to the current confinement order so that he can return home immediately, his lawyer said, according to Reuters.
 The 53-year-old will be released home this afternoon, local time, from the Otisville federal prison following a Covid-19 test.
 "Today's important ruling recognises that individuals retain their right to speak even when they are incarcerated," said ACLU attorney Vera Eidelman.
 Cohen has served a year of his three-year sentence.
 The former fixer admitted to lying to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, and to campaign finance violations for his role in making hush money payments to women alleging affairs with Mr Trump. He also admitted to other tax and bank fraud charges unrelated to the president.
 The Department of Justice earlier declined to comment on the matter.

PETERSBURG - Virtual learning will continue for Petersburg students this fall in what is being called "Petersburg Virtual Academy."
   
 The school board chose to go virtual, while also considering two hybrid options where students would have both in-person, and virtual instruction. No option for complete in-person reopening was considered.
   
 Classes will return for all K-12 students on Sept. 8. Superintendent Dr. Maria Pitre-Martin recommended that the school board re-evaluate whether or not to return to in-person classes after the first 9-week school period.
   
 "I make decisions based on what I know will be in the best interests of wellness for young people," Pitre-Martin said at the school board meeting July 23. "With the hybrid model we cannot guarantee the elimination of (risk)."
   
 Petersburg Virtual Academy - as the name suggests - is a completely virtual option. All schools will be closed to students. Students will engage in virtual instruction Monday through Thursday. Friday is scheduled to be a student support day, where teachers will use Zoom and phone calls to check in with families.
   
 "We literally just want to spend a day just touching base with a student's family.," Pitre-Martin said. "...This entire plan is predicated on upping our support and customer service, which is why you see a student support day listed. We don't want to lose connection, we want to tighten connection during this process."
   
 Dr. Alton Hart Jr. MD, director for the Crater Health District which oversees Petersburg, said that opening schools with any in-person instruction would always pose risk for transmission of COVID-19.
   
 "Regardless of rates of transmission in our community, it's not a matter of if, but a matter of when," Hart said.
   
 As part of it's planning for reopening, Petersburg Schools asked it's parents and staff for their thoughts on returning through a survey.
   
 Given five different options - including totally virtual and two hybrid virtual, in-person options - over half of the households in the school system voted for online courses. One hybrid option was the next closest with 18% of the total. Complete reopening of schools with safety measures had 15% of the tally.
   
 Additionally, 37% of parents said they would not send their students to in- person classes, even if schools decided to go with an in-person opening.
   
 Teachers answered qualitative questions by expressing concerns about enforcing safety measures over students, like ensuring that students are wearing masks for the entire school day, especially at the elementary level.
   
 For the virtual academy to work, PCPS says every student has to have a Chromebook and connectivity to the internet. Staff said the school system is trying to secure additional funding for Wi-Fi hotspots, but that it currently has enough to support students at their homes.
   
 All school days will be 5.5 hours long and pacing guides have been planned so that curriculum carries over in the event that PCPS decides to go back to in- person classes later in the school year.
   
 Schools also estimate a 30% increase of technical support calls from students when schools return virtually. Pitre-Martin talked about establishing a call center-like support structure to quickly handle technology questions from students and parents.
   
 Meals distribution will continue as it has since the pandemic closed education systems in March. Daily food distribution will be expanded to all schools in the system, and bus drop-offs will continue to run through city neighborhoods.
   
 The Virginia Department of Education is responsible for submitting waivers for the Standards of Learning requirements. School systems were granted a break on SOL's for the 2019-20 school year, but Pitre-Martin said the state DOE is yet to start that conversation for the upcoming school year.
   
 VDOE is expected to release a memo Friday that explains the process for taking attendance virtually.
   
 Pitre-Martin expects to update the school board with regular data about the virtual approach. They will reconsider entering into hybrid instructional days for the second 9-weeks.
   
 Hybrid Option A - Half of students attend in-person classes on Monday and Tuesday. The other half has in-person instruction on Thursday and Friday. On days when students are not at school, they will have virtual learning. Wednesdays are scheduled for deep school cleaning and student support days.
   
 Hybrid Option B - Half of students attend in-person classes on Monday and Tuesday. The other half attends in-person classes Wednesday and Thursday. Friday is scheduled for deep cleaning and student support days.
   
 Both options allow parents to opt-in to virtual only schedules. All school days are five hours, 30 minutes long, regardless of which option is chosen.
   
 Before voting to approve the superintendent's recommendation to go virtual, school board vice-chair Steven L. Pierce said he wanted to err on the side of safety.
   
 "The biggest responsibility we have as board members to the community is ensuring that our children are safe and they are protected," Pierce said. "We have enough info to show that we can educate them whether it by hybrid or it be virtual. But if we can't protect them from the worst possible enemy that could hurt them then we've lost and the responsibility has gone away."

D’un, il faut tenir compte du facteur temps. Nous sommes à trois mois de l’élection présidentielle. De deux, nous n’avons pas prévu un plan B. Troisièmement, nous avons besoin de partir unis à cette élection. Quatrièmement, ce scrutin, nous devons le gagner pour la Côte d’Ivoire, pour les Ivoiriens et surtout pour honorer la mémoire de notre Premier ministre qui était le candidat du Rhdp. Tenant compte du timing très serré, la personne qui peut nous faire gagner et maintenir la cohésion au sein du parti, garantir la paix et la stabilité tout en poursuivant le programme de développement, c’est bel et bien Alassane Ouattara. Ce sont ces arguments qui font que personnellement, je suis totalement en phase avec ceux qui pensent que le Président doit briquer un autre mandat. Evidemment, nos adversaires souhaitent qu’il en soit autrement. Car avoir le Président Ouattara en face, c’est une défaite déjà programmée. Ils espéraient voir le Rhdp faire un choix dans la précipitation qui va créer une déchirure et voir le parti voler en éclat. Préfèrent affronter un candidat que le Président Ouattara n’a pas eu le temps de bien préparer. Mais nous restons vigilants, nous n’allons pas nous laisser émouvoir. Je demande solennellement au Président Ouattara qui aime la Côte d’Ivoire et qui veut que son parti, le Rhdp, demeure fort, de bien vouloir accepter d’être candidat à l’élection présidentielle d’octobre 2020. Qu’il se fasse violence, ce n’est pas se dédire. La politique, c’est aussi la saine appréciation des réalités du moment. La réalité d’aujourd’hui commande que nous allions à cette élection en rang serré. Surtout que nous avons des adversaires qui n’ont d’autre programme que de venir au pouvoir pour se venger, régler des comptes et créer des tensions dans le pays. Je ne pense pas que ce soit ce que le Président Ouattara souhaite. Il a énormément investi pour que la Côte d’Ivoire renoue avec la paix et le développement. Pour rien au monde, il ne voudra pas voir ce travail titanesque, qui n’est pas achevé, tomber à l’eau. C’est la raison pour laquelle, Kandia Camara, membre du Directoire du Rhdp, sa fille, lui demande d’être le candidat du Rhdp.

Earlier this week, Tesco unveiled a cunning plan to cut costs amid the global economic downturn.
 Gone are the costly third-party suppliers it usually relies on to clean shop floors, fridges and staff areas in its nearly 2,000 Metro and Express stores. It’s fine though. Rather than expecting shelves to gather dust (or germs) in a time of global pandemic, the company’s existing staff will take on the duties themselves, on top of their day jobs.
 In principle it appears to be a sound idea. Store budgets will be increased in order to give staff the time to complete the additional cleaning duties and, following a successful trial, executives say that giving individual stores autonomy over their own schedules leads to better and more consistent results.

“I have to say this is a rather sad sight,” admitted Lloyd Webber, addressing the sparse audience from the stage. Socially distanced theatre is “a misery for performers” as well as feeling flat and in any case financially unviable, he said. Assuring the audience that the theatre’s air-filtering system meant “we are safer in here than you would be in Oxford Street”, he said the pilot was not about reopening the Palladium but getting the whole industry back in full swing.

In our race for best luxury pick, this OLED from LG was neck and neck with the Sony A8H. In the end, the Sony’s overall experience and visual reproduction gave it the edge. The CX 55 is a great OLED and more affordable if you want the smaller size. It delivers deep blacks and vibrant content, but we found the A8H gave us a more realistic view.

One of the best things about the TCL 6-Series is that it’s a Roku TV, so you get access to thousands of streaming services out of the box. You don’t need a treasure map to find the content, either. The main interface is a simple three-box-wide grid and a list on the side that acts as a quick settings menu. Your inputs (like HDMIs and antennas) appear as boxes on the grid, beside the boxes for the streaming services and apps you choose to add, allowing for quick switching. The interface can get clunky as your list of services and apps grows, but you can organize and arrange them — as a grid or list — however you like, to make it easier to find what you’re looking for.

Nessel said in a news release Thursday she agreed to review the case, pledging transparency and an unbiased second look.
 “As Attorney General I have consistently advocated for a thorough, comprehensive and objective review of all officer-involved shootings, particularly those which result in fatalities,” Nessel said in the release. “This matter will receive an exhaustive review and analysis with an impartial lens and, when completed, our department is committed to transparency in our decision-making process, irrespective of the outcome. Justice demands nothing less.”
 Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham said he welcomes the review.
 “In light of recent inquiries into our investigation, we welcome the Attorney General’s office to review our investigation, facts and findings that were presented to the Macomb County Prosecutor’s Office,” Wickersham said in the release. “We will provide the Attorney General’s office anything they need as we remain open and transparent.”

 “The boy I train with stays very close but hasn’t gone home,” she said. Also she is waiting for the Wrestling Federation of India or SAI to spell out future plans.
 Injured and in rehabilitation for almost the whole of 2019, Pooja is understandably in a tough place. She missed the 2019 Worlds due to injuries, followed by defeat to 18-year-old Anshu Malik in the 57kg trials for the now- rescheduled Asian Qualifiers, and was out of the reckoning for the Tokyo Olympics.
 With the WFI indicating that there would be fresh trials in 2021, Pooja has another chance to make the cut for Tokyo. But with a new lot of juniors becoming eligible next year, it would also increase competition in what is already one of the most crowded weight categories.
 “A lot of sports have resumed training, including boxing, but unlike others, wrestlers cannot train properly without a sparring partner. In that sense, we are the most desperate to get back to full-time training.
 “But with all the restrictions, I am not sure if that will be possible even if there is a camp.
 “Of course, if it becomes mandatory then there will be no option. Let us wait and watch,” she said.

Audio quality on the 6-Series is a little underwhelming; we found it too easy, for instance, for the mix to get muddied, with vocals meshing together alongside background ambiance. We definitely recommend pairing the 6-Series with a soundbar or home theater system. That said, it’s true across the board that as TVs have slimmed down, so has the built-in sound quality, and we’d recommend adding external speakers to any of the TVs on this list.

For those willing and able to spend top dollar, the Sony A8H, a 2020 OLED TV, delivers a vibrant and strong picture with deep blacks and a sleek build. Though it starts at $1,898 for a 55-inch model (the 65-inch is $2,798), you’re getting an OLED, which means the panel is made up of pixels that individually emit a color to create a sharper image. The Sony A8H boasts a broad range of colors, from glowing brights to subtle pastels, and pitch-dark blacks. It supports an array of picture standards that automatically upscale and improve the quality of content, and the result is an exceptionally vibrant and detailed picture.
