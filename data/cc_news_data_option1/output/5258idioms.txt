Officials continue to point to parents' hesitancy and health concerns around sending their children back to school, yet any reopening plan would be voluntary. No family will be forced to return. While the vaccine is a light at the end of the tunnel, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, recently said, "You can reopen elementary schools before you have the vaccine for teachers." And, if middle and high school won't be returning inside buildings this school year, we need to adequately consider outdoor instruction.

But that’s a tall order. Biden’s Cabinet will inherit agencies in disarray -- the Trump administration rolled back environmental protections, suppressed climate science, and pushed career public servants out in droves. Biden wants to hit the ground running on January 20 with a $2 trillion climate plan that seeks to revitalize the economy, significantly ratchet down emissions, and correct environmental injustices across the nation. His "Climate Cabinet" will be tasked with making much of that happen, especially if Republicans retain control of the Senate and Biden is forced to lean on the powers of the executive branch.

Like many I was surprised, but not shocked, when Donald Trump posted a respectable win over Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College in 2016. There would be a few faithless electors in the Electoral College who tried to break away from supporting Trump that day, but they were ruled out of order. A subsequent Supreme Court decision this year bound Electors to the direction given by the popular vote and prevailing laws of each state.


  Four years and one hard-fought election contest later, Trump’s electoral margin of loss is the same as was his victory over Clinton. Clinton’s loss also came down to close contests in a handful of states, specifically Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.


  I understand and appreciate both the disappointment and inability to accept this loss by the President and his supporters. But while they collectively blame state and local election officials, U.S. Senators in those states, the U.S. Supreme Court and Dominion Voting Services, consider a few more documentable facts which point more to the existing conclusion of this election.

In 2018, Kshama and Socialist Alternative led a movement to tax Amazon and other big businesses. It passed after a protracted fight, but was quickly repealed by the same city council when Amazon threatened to withdraw from the construction of a new Seattle high-rise. A year later, a new Tax Amazon movement emerged after Kshama won re-election, defeating her opponent who received unprecedented sums of corporate cash from Amazon and other corporations hostile to her unapologetic working class politics. Taxing Amazon to fund social services proved to be a popular demand during the George Floyd uprising over the summer, and petitioners easily came up with the required number of signatures to put the Amazon Tax on the ballot. Feeling the pressure, the all Democrat council preempted the ballot initiative with a watered down version of the tax, which was beefed up with organized input from activists in public comment on the bill and Kshama Sawant’s interventions in the negotiations. Still, we understand that we need to fight to expand the tax further.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has barred public celebrations of New Year while the police said detailed order will be issued once there is clarity from the government.


  According to city mayor Murlidhar Mohol, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, PMC has appealed to people not to celebrate New Year in public places such as Fergusson College and JM roads.


  The hotels and restaurants, meanwhile, have not planned any big parties considering lack of clarity from the government.


  Mohol's remarks come in the wake of state government imposing night curfew from Tuesday evening till January 5. The curfew will be effective in all the municipal corporation areas across the state from 11pm till 6am. It has decided to keep all passengers coming from Europe and Middle-East countries in institutional quarantine facilities for 14 days and other travellers will be asked to be home-quarantined.


  In the city, areas like Deccan Gymkhana, FC road, Pune cantonment, JM road often witness large crowd where gather to celebrate New Year.


  "The threat of pandemic still exists. We will have to follow precautions and avoid public function at a large level. So, we appeal all residents of Pune city to avoid the celebration of New Year at public places," said Mohol.


  While written order from PMC was awaited, in Mumbai, the municipal corporation has appealed people not to celebrate New Year in public places and stop busting crackles.


  Santosh Zagade, excise superintendent, said, "We have not given permission to hotels or any other type of liquor establishment to function in absence of guidelines from the state government. The directives issued by the state will be implemented vigorously."


  Prominent restaurateur Ikram Khan of Sohos Toscana, hotel, said, " We will follow guidelines of the state government regarding the functioning of the hotels. The industry is already reeling under severe crisis and more than eighty per cent of the hotel industry is over. We need strong pro-active steps by the government to boost the hotel trade which currently has hit rock bottom."


  Joint commissioner (Law and Order) Dr Ravindra Shisve, said, "We cannot comment today and we are waiting for the orders. We want the clarify our position to the citizens only after we receive the order in black and white."

The highway police have identified at least 39 crash barrier punctures (gaps) on both sides of the Pune-Mumbai expressway, where stray animals and motorists were found intruding, leading to mishaps.According to highway police, 24 crash barrier punctures have been identified on Mumbai to Pune lane of the high-speed corridor while 15 crash barriers were found punctured from Pune to Mumbai lane of the highway.The highway police under the superintendent of police Sanjay Jadhav has submitted a report to the state government stating that some villagers had broken the security fencing at different places to reach to the highway, where only four-wheelers are allowed as per guidelines.The breaches were facilitating the movement of cattle, buffaloes, human being and two-wheeler riders and possibilities of fatal accidents cannot be ruled out, the report stated.In 2019, between January and October, 56 fatal accidents claimed 65 lives on the expressway while this year during the same time span, 53 fatal accidents were reported in which 58 people lost their lives. While the total number of accidents is comparatively less than last year -- in 2019, 255 accidents were reported from January to October and 121 accidents were reported in 2020 during the same period."We have conducted the inspection of the most vulnerable points on the expressway for the first time. These areas need to be repaired and necessary communication has been conveyed to the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) for action. These places might see accidents and I have personally inspected, visited and verified each of the spots on the expressway," said Jadhav.According to Jadhav, Wadgaon division of the highway police have communicated it to MSRDC to immediately carry out repairs of the said breaches to prevent future accidents, the highway police report states.Similarly, the highway police have been carrying out regular programmes aiming at creating awareness about the road safety measures and dangers of breaching on the expressway.The locals of the adjoining villages were summoned for the briefing programme on road safety taking place at regular intervals. The report further mentions that the MSRDC had assured the police that the punctures will be repaired at the earliest.According to Rakesh Sonawane, executive engineer MSRDC, the punctures are closed from time to time. "Local villagers in order to save time carry out these breaches. We have tried to convince through dialogues about the dangers of trespassing on the highway. Even the local policemen have been urged to take strict action in these cases. While trying to explain the risks of punctures, the locals do pick up quarrels," said Sonawane.Independent researcher and activist Tanmay Pendse, whose brother and Marathi actor Akshay Pendse, and nephew died in an expressway accident in December 2012, said, " Human behaviour has changed since the outbreak of Covid-19. Commuters have taken to wheels after a long time and stress levels have gone high. Now is the right time to pay attention to highway safety. Commuters are overspeeding and the median punctures are dangerous and can lead to more fatalities. MSRDC must take up the repair work at the earliest and make it safe for commuters," he said.Nine injured in two separate accidents on December 19Nine persons were injured in two separate accidents on the Pune- Mumbai expressway and the old Pune-Mumbai highway on Saturday because of poor visibility.In the first accident three passengers in a car were injured after it rammed into a truck ahead of it at the Bhor gate on the Pune-Mumbai expressway near Khopoli.In the second accident, six persons travelling in amini bus were hurt after the bus lost control and toppled near Khopoli.

When Tony Hawk's Pro Skater first hit the scene at the turn of the century it was a pioneering new game that essentially created its own genre. As the series continued, so did the gameplay integrations. Sequels added even more potential for massive, out of this world, trick combos by throwing in manuals and reverts. And who could forget about those iconic soundtracks? When Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 hit the pavement this year it was like a shot of adrenaline for the skateboarding genre. Not only did it make visual improvements and integrate the aforementioned reverts and manuals into its earlier titles, it also continued the series' message of inclusion by adding nonbinary skater Leo Baker to its roster of playable characters. The first two Tony Hawk games were already bangers, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 did a great job of reminding folks of that fact while bringing life back to the series, which had admittedly been struggling over the last few years.
