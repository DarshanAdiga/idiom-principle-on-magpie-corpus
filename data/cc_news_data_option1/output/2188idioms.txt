Since World War Two the U.S. has killed an estimated 30 million people, none of whom were ever a threat to the US American people. Ethically, morally and legally most US Americans are guilty of war crimes. The German people were not let off the hook after WW2. The US American people are just as guilty now.

To vault again after the severe ankle injury Marissa Kalsey suffered in the spring of 2016 was highly unlikely.
 The fact the Waynesburg Central graduate won the national championship a little over a year later on May 25, 2017, with a record-breaking vault to boot, was simply remarkable.
 Kalsey, a redshirt senior, won her first national title by breaking the national meet record and her Westminster College mark with her winning vault of 4.22 meters (13-10), a mark that still stands. Ithaca’s Katherine Pitman, who finished second to Kalsey, set the record in 2016 with her winning vault of 4.21 meters.

"Binky" Sages passed away last weekend from cancer. To those who might not know of Binky, he was my longtime barber.
 He was old-school. Binky might've been the last person in America to use White Rain to hold my freshly-cut hair (along with the occasional blast of cigarette smoke). He used to cut my grandmother's hair.
 I can count on one hand how many times Binky or his former partner John Prah did not given me a haircut since I first sat in the booster chair, say around 57, 58 years ago.
 (There is no way any barber, dentist or member of the medical profession was paid enough to deal with a preschool me. I was, let's say, a bit squirmy and uncooperative at that age.)
 I've often said barber shops are among the bastions of democracy because discussions go all over the place, and Binky's shop was no different.
 He was an avid hunter and sportsman (as evidenced by the works of taxidermy in the shop, including a groundhog donning a Steeler lei and sunglasses greeting patrons).
 Binky had a walk-in shop (not possible in these days of COVID-19), so you'd take a seat and wait your turn. We had a bit of a routine in the latter days before his retirement. He'd spot me, ask my age and say "See that guy, I gave him his first haircut," as though I was a living advertisement.
 The need for a haircut would usually coincide with a road race, so I would always ask for an "aerodynamic cut" to help me walk faster. (He would also point out to patrons patiently waiting their turn that I walked the Summit, either in amazement or this guy is nuts.)
 When the calendar turned to fall, the Pittsburgh Steelers questions would come forth, as though I had any inside information (which I don't). He would also announce I wrote for the Herald-Standard, which would generally lead me to pick up the shop copy and point to a story I had in the edition that day.
 So, to his wife Cecilia and children Joe, Bob and Kristie, condolences on the loss of a pretty unique fella.

The world’s No. 1 female golfer Ko Jin-young was visibly excited to compete in the first official tournament of the year on Jeju Island. As the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) has been suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the South Korean golfer opened her first tournament of the season with the first round of the Lotte Cantata Ladies Open of the LPGA of Korea Tour held at Lotte Skyhill Jeju Country Club in Seogwipo on Thursday. Her last competition was the final round of the CME Group Tour Championship of the LPGA Tour 192 days ago in November last year.      As the resumption of the LPGA Tour becomes delayed, Ko decided to compete in the Jeju tournament to recover her form. “Although I was born in Seoul, Jeju is like the second home to me. In Jeju, I relieve stress hanging out in cafes with beautiful ocean views and often go to my favorite pork BBQ place,” said Ko who spends time relaxing at a house owned by her parents off-season. It was also Jeju where she heralded her comeback with the first win of the season after eleven failed attempts due to her wrist injury in 2017.      Ko is determined to show gradually improving performance as three rounds are left. “I am in a good physical condition as I worked out a lot during a long break, however, my shots are not as good as they should be,” she said. “I will focus on recovering my form.”
