A year ago.
 Seems so far away seen through the present-day lens of our new topsy-turvy existence, the product of an infectious disease smacking us right in the kisser.
 A year ago. Jason Kenney and his United Conservatives won the ballot battle in Alberta and tossed the NDP out on their ear in convincing fashion.
 The fight wasn't even close. The mood was one of hope and change and better times.
 A year later and the novel coronavirus has shut us down, closed us in, cut a path of sickness and death, thrown the economy in the ditch.
 The oil price is deep in the tank and the premier talks about sometimes feeling overwhelmed "managing unprecedented crises."
 The premier tells us we're in for "very, very tough times" and when he realized how tough it just hit him "like a ton of bricks."
 His mind is laser-focused on the mayhem caused by COVID-19 and on the economy, where the ills include the effect of the virus but also go beyond it.
 We could see 400,000 unemployed in Alberta. The jobless count could potentially top half a million. Kenney is clearly frustrated.
 "As powerful as government can be there are no levers big enough or powerful enough at our disposal to insulate people from what is coming at us economically."
 There is no quick fix.
 Meanwhile, the virus continues to be out there.
 The premier hopes to relax many of the restrictions this spring but not all of them as long as the virus is out there.
 These days the premier says he takes each day one at a time. Yes, there's planning for the future but he focuses on each pitch as it comes.
 Kenney is well aware of the burden he bears and his role in rallying Alberta to the challenge of defeating the invisible enemy.
 He admits having "emotional moments" the past few months grasping the enormity of what faces him and all of us.
 He says "we shouldn't sit around in despair" and Albertans should feel motivated and even excited to do something big, something big together, something to save lives, something to be recounted one day in the history books.
 Kenney says we should take some courage from those who came before us. They went through much tougher times and built what we now have.
 The premier points to the "moral obligation" of everyone to come together and create "an iron ring of defence" between the killer virus and seniors especially vulnerable to its destructive power.
 We have to make choices and, says Kenney, doing the right thing and the good thing requires "discipline and sacrifice but also generosity and love."
 Sometimes he hears people say we should just let 'er rip and get everything back to normal right now because this virus only affects older people.
 Kenney call this attitude "so callous."
 The premier refuses to put lipstick on what is obviously a very rancid pig.
 It could be up to a year and a half before oil prices get back to reasonable levels.
 Before better days, there will be worse ones. A full victory against our enemy will not come without a vaccine in wide use.
 "I don't want anybody in Alberta to give up. We're just giving people straight talk."
 The premier says Albertans should be very proud of how well the province is doing in this battle against the pandemic, the result of "a deep reservoir of common sense" and the ability "to get the job done."
 While Ottawa and China and the World Health Organization were in denial about the virus, Kenney says in Alberta "at the very first rumours of a strange flu in Wuhan, our guys started ordering mountains of equipment and gearing up our testing."
 Through all of this, some fault-finders feel Kenney is not emotional enough, doesn't display his heart on his sleeve enough.
 "The last thing I think about in this crisis is what my critics think of me. I couldn't care less," says Kenney, mentioning one of his favourites, a wartime British prime minister.
 "Winston Churchill didn't go out there on radio and have tearful beta-male meltdowns seeking empathy.
 "It is the responsibility of leadership at a time like this to show strength and certainty."
 He'll need both in full measure in the days and weeks ahead, leading the charge in a war nowhere on the horizon in those very different days just one year ago.

To win the money, they need to form bonds that are more than skin deep. The catch is they can’t have any sexual contact - even with themselves - for the remainder of “the retreat.” For every sexual encounter, the group loses money out of the prize pot. Can the sexy singles restrain themselves, even when workshops and drama challenges their resolve?

NEW YORK (AP) — The coronavirus is poised to reshape the political map, pummeling battleground states and alarming Republicans who see early signs of an election that could be a referendum on President Donald Trump’s management of the crisis.The pandemic, which has killed more than 30,000 Americans and left millions out of work, has eviscerated Trump's hope to run for reelection on a strong economy. A series of states he won in 2016 could tilt toward Democrats.In Florida, a Republican governor closely aligned with Trump has come under scrutiny for being slow to close the state. In Wisconsin, the Democratic victor in last week's Supreme Court race captured 28 counties, up from the 12 that Hillary Clinton won four years ago. In Michigan, a Democratic governor has seen her approval rating rise against the backdrop of a fight with Trump. And in Arizona, low marks for Trump could be enough to turn the formerly Republican stronghold into a tossup."It makes me wonder if there's something brewing in the weaker elements of the Trump base," said Paul Maslin, a Wisconsin-based Democratic pollster. "Is the pandemic fight the final straw that's going to cause some of this small slice of votes he needs to win these states to back away?"Trump's public approval rating has remained consistent nationally throughout his presidency, and some polls even suggested an uptick at the onset of the pandemic. And his unique brand of politics rooted in cultural grievances could once again overcome hurdles that would sink other presidents seeking reelection, especially if the pandemic wanes or the economy rebounds.But Trump's campaign is concerned about losing support in several key swing states, particularly Florida and Wisconsin, according to five current and former campaign staffers who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about internal strategy. There are also growing worries about Arizona and Pennsylvania.There is no better example of the altered map confronting Trump than Michigan, which he captured in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes.The mounting deaths in heavily African American Detroit and the politically dynamic suburban counties have been the backdrop for the tiff between Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Trump. Though her handling of the virus outbreak has prompted some public protests, Whitmer's poll numbers have gone up and her criticism of the federal response prompted Trump to obliquely dismiss the governor, telling virus task force members "Don't call the woman in Michigan."In a sign of enthusiasm, participation in Democrats' March primary was up 32% over 2016 as the party rallied around its likely nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden. The Trump campaign already had a light footprint in Michigan — it does not have a single field office — and advisers privately concede it could be the toughest battleground state to hold.Many pollsters believe Wisconsin could be the tipping point this November for either candidate to reach the needed 270 electoral votes. The state has long been considered the Rust Belt prize Trump was likeliest to keep, but poignant images of mask-wearing voters lining up outside Milwaukee's few open polling places last week signaled Democratic enthusiasm."We are starting to see more evidence that suburban voters disapprove of the way Trump is handling the coronavirus pandemic," said Democratic strategist Adrienne Elrod, who notes that counties outside Philadelphia and Phoenix "have a similar electorate to the suburban areas that delivered a huge win for Democrats in Wisconsin."Although the state Supreme Court race received national attention, Republicans were quick to dismiss it since only Democrats held a competitive presidential primary, boosting that party's turnout. Wisconsin's spring Supreme Court contests have been a shaky predictor of presidential elections, which usually feature twice as many voters."President Trump has been clear — through actions and words — that what matters most is the health and safety of every American. This crisis is hitting Americans — not Democrats or Republicans," said Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine. "To try and politicize this crisis in terms of the election is ludicrous."Although Arizona hasn't yet seen a spike in infections, Biden's promise of pragmatic, experienced management may play well in a state that has turned purple. A Biden victory there would build pressure on Trump to hold two of the trio of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.The pandemic has hamstrung the Trump campaign's effort to build momentum. Though its digital outreach has ramped up, the campaign has been unable to wield its financial advantage over Biden and can't hold its signature rallies to bolster enthusiasm and collect valuable voter data."We can't wait to get back out there and do things the old-fashioned way," said Lara Trump, a senior campaign official and the president's daughter-in-law.Employment has cratered in many of the states key to Trump's reelection.The economy shed 22 million jobs in the past four weeks, according to requests for unemployment benefits. And while some of those jobs will return as the lockdown gets lifted, it's unclear how quickly workers will be needed at hotels in Florida, auto plants in Michigan and stores and offices that fill Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona.Both Michigan and Pennsylvania have lost more than 1 million jobs since the outbreak, which implies unemployment rates of more than 20% in both states, according to Labor Department figures. Unemployment filings suggest Florida employers have let go of roughly 6% of its jobs, but declines there could worsen as applicants have struggled to access unemployment benefits.Without Florida, Trump's path to victory becomes nearly impossible. Its Trump-friendly governor, Ron DeSantis, took heat for allowing beaches to stay open despite the risk of spread to his state's massive population of vulnerable senior citizens."They thought they were going to be running for reelection with a very popular governor, but DeSantis has taken some real hits over his handling of this," said Republican strategist Alex Conant, who worked for Marco Rubio's presidential campaign. "The image of spring breakers spreading coronavirus is going to be replayed in October."___Riccardi reported from Denver and Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.
