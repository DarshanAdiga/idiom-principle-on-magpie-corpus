Musk even gave others the green light to carry out their own plans as he pivoted to work on Boring Company projects. While it's true a handful of companies are working to bring the super high-speed subway of sorts to life, Virgin Hyperloop is one of the most credible companies out there. And West Virginia will be home to the company's next step.


  The company said on Thursday it selected the state as the upcoming home of a $500 million certification center and test track. The facility will work to regulatory and safety standards alongside the US government and perfect the floating-pod transport network before it's available for wide-scale use. Using magnetic levitation technology in vacuum tubes, pod vehicles could travel at speeds up to 600 mph. Virgin previously estimated a trip between New York and Washington, DC, could take just 30 minutes.
