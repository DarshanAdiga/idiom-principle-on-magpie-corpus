Essentially what followed was a new, albeit shortened race, and with a very different starting order. After racing resumed, Hamilton had to return to the pits to serve his penalty. When he rejoined the race, he was well behind everyone. That sealed his fate.
 Race fans were treated to a superb display of driving by AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly, at the front of the field. In the closing laps, he defended against hard-charging Carlos Sainz in his McLaren/Renault to take the checkered flag. Lance Stroll, in his Racing Point/Mercedes, completed a very unlikely podium of three young drivers representing teams that have been trying unsuccessfully to win a Formula One race for years.

Johnson said he wasn’t expecting the ball on the play. CP had three receivers to his side in an effort to isolate tight end Felix Meeks.
 “I just ran to the corner of the end zone and (Pettit) put it right there on the dot,” Johnson said. “It was a great ball.”
 Sammy Brewer added an 18-yard field goal in the fourth quarter.
 Crown Point (2-2, 1-1) has six consecutive wins over Lake Central, dating back to 2015.
 “(LC) is a neighborhood school. A lot of our guys know their guys,” Enright said. “They always play us hard. It’s one of those deals, Lake Central, Merrillville, typically these games are competitive regardless of both teams’ records.”

“We’ve done pasture burns up here before, when you ‘trail’ it and burn the pasture, but anymore that’s frowned upon,” John Livingston said while guiding his Ford Diesel F-250 extended cab through a field full of fire weed. Resting in the field was a black “Happy Birthday” balloon which had been deposited in recent days.
 As the pickup neared the eastern edge of his land, chainsaws could be heard in the distance. A pair of ATVs crested the ridge as Bill Livingston and Jacob Livingston were headed back toward the family homes.
 “It sounds like there could be some activity going on up there, but I can’t tell with all the chainsaws going and trees falling everywhere,” he told his grandfather.
 Bill Livingston and Jacob Livingston had been up near the neighboring ranch since early in the morning, making sure there hadn’t been any flare-ups on either of the properties.
 “We were able to limb some cedar trees between ranches and put out some small spot fires in the canyon,” Bill Livingston said.
 In the distance, a 10-person fire crew from Miller Timber Services of Philomath was reinforcing fire lines and cooling off hot spots from small spot fires. Two bulldozers were digging more fire lines on the southern edge of the Livingston Ranch and a neighboring ranch which abuts Little River Road.
 Over the years, many wildfires have caused Glide residents to be concerned, but John Livingston said the Archie Creek Fire has been especially too close for comfort.
 “This is the one that’s been more personal than we’d like to see it,” John Livingston said.

Una mattina, durante il lockdown, mi sono seduto al centro del piazzale della Vittoria. Per mezz'ora sono rimasto ad ascoltare il silenzio assordante. La Basilica è sempre rimasta aperta, ma le persone si contavano sulle dita di una mano. Non c'erano riti, celebrazioni, sacramenti. Ecco il deserto. Il silenzio mi ha condotto a tornare con più vigore alla parola di Dio, a lasciarmi sedurre ancora una volta da Maria e dal Signore. In questi giorni lo Spirito Santo continua a soffiare. Siamo nel deserto, fatichiamo, siamo inquieti, ma la meta luminosa è lì davanti. L'8 settembre è l'Aurora di Salvezza. Sta a noi farci aiutare da Maria. Da colei che, ai piedi della croce, non è scappata, ma è rimasta lì, confortata dalla Speranza.

Rakul said, “I had tested negative the day before Arjun's report came. He didn't come in contact with anyone on the set. I traced back and figured that he might have come in contact with someone infected while I was shooting in Hyderabad. The plane was still on the runway when I got the call. Had I known even half an hour earlier, I wouldn’t have boarded the flight.” She shared that after getting to know about Arjun’s positive reports, she called up her Telugu film producer to advance the shoots. However, she mentioned that it was not possible as they had dates from other stars as well for September 15. The actress headed back to Hyderabad on September 9.

CROWN POINT — JJ Johnson is a natural quarterback.
 The sophomore caught the only Crown Point touchdown pass Friday, but it was his carries out of the backfield in the fourth quarter that sealed a 16-7 win over Lake Central.
 “The first couple plays (at quarterback) are always tough to read. It gets me a little antsy but the more it goes, I just love it,” Johnson said. “I’m just glad they trust me to do it. It’s a great opportunity to go out on the field as a sophomore and make some plays with our guys.”
 Johnson ran it four times for 19 yards on the final drive, eating up the clock.

As former NASA employees, we feel that NASA’s advocacy of an extreme position, prior to a thorough study of the possible overwhelming impact of natural climate drivers is inappropriate. We request that NASA refrain from including unproven and unsupported remarks in its future releases and websites on this subject. At risk is damage to the exemplary reputation of NASA, NASA’s current or former scientists and employees, and even the reputation of science itself.
