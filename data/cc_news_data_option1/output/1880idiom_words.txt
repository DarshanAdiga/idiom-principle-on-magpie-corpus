Musk defying lockdown to curb coronavirus wasn't met with much appreciation from his followers but when the US President backed his desperation, it was a moment of celebration for the Teslaman. After having facing heat in the past few weeks, Musk sat down to chill down with an ice cream sundae.                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Did Musk blatantly steal a photo from the Internet and claim it as his own? Going by his own reputation, one would give him a benefit of doubt as Musk is a dank meme connoisseur and a reposter-lover of many weird Internet things. His follow-up tweet seemed like a mockery that he got to do what he wanted to more than having the sneaky intention of stealing someone else's sundae photo from the web. Or was it an attempt to show his _edgy_ side by dining out in pandemic? It's Musk so no one can be certain.                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

But guess what? It was neither his sundae nor was the photo clicked in 2020. This was pointed out in a tweet below his.                                         *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange
