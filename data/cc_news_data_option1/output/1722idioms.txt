Kris Gore has student dress-up days. Katie Welty and Kate White use Rebus puzzles and brain teasers, enticing social studies students to use their critical thinking skills. This is just a tiny snapshot of the countless ways WPS teachers are working to reach our students.
 But wait, there’s more!
 School counselors have set up their own virtual classrooms where students can touch base with them throughout the remainder of the school year, and have also begun online enrollment for the fall. Our Project AWARE team, Amy Whitewater and Dalinda Hix, has launched a teletherapy program to keep students connected with those services they were receiving prior to the closing of doors.
 To keep things “livened up,” Highland Park faculty have adopted themes for virtual staff meetings, and recently wore wigs to “Get Wiggy With It!” Elementary school principals are joining live classes with students to check on them and some are also sharing morning announcements virtually. At the middle school, Chanda Peters set-up an individual Google Meet with each 7th and 8th grade teacher to offer support.
 And, as of Friday, April 14, many of our cafeteria workers, bus drivers, paras and volunteer teachers have helped serve 23,888 meals to WPS students, just since spring break. Kim Williams, WPS social worker, has been able to continue our Backpack Program, and with the help of donations from school clubs and organizations, churches, and a few additional generous sources, is hopeful to keep the program running throughout the summer months. This is nothing short of amazing.
 Let’s be real. I haven’t really enriched my instruction with much in the way of digital resources, online games, etc. My colleagues who are gifted in utilizing such wonderful educational tools with their students impress me daily. But, since that’s not really my jam, I am resigned to call upon a solid skill set which I have well-honed over the years, and used extensively in the classroom.
 Being ridiculously goofy and having little self-pride.
 Every day for my online class, I dress up. But….you couldn’t really call it “professional dress.”
 I choose a costume and theme or slogan each night and surprise the kids with it during our live meetings each day. On Read-Aloud-Wednesdays, I read a short story for the students and my costume is based on a character, or something else related to the story. It’s been so much fun, and the kids’ reactions are comical.
 My antics are nothing new to them, so they don’t even flinch when I dress as a tourist on safari, a member of Whoville, a Karate master, a pirate, or 1960s flower child. The majority wake up and attend class in their pajamas, so my zany, eccentric attire is the first thing that meets their eyes in the morning. Since they think I’m bonkers anyway, it’s just another day of class for them.
 Like every other teacher in America right now, I just want to know my kids are safe and their needs are being met. This is our top priority. Whether or not they answer every question correctly, turn-in every assignment, or understand every nuance of the material is not our chief concern. Their well-being is paramount. Meeting together affords us the opportunity to touch base and continue building and maintaining relationships with them daily.
 If dressing up in outlandish outfits keeps them coming back, I will continue to do so. They need the stability and security this continuation of school and contact with their friends and teachers can help provide. Many are living in unstable environments and need that connection to what is familiar and routine, normal and comfortable. As teachers, we need that connection too. Our students are part of our hearts.
 And this is but a small snippet of what our Woodward Public School employees are doing for the children of Woodward.
 What a blessing to be their colleague.
 Editor's Note: Woodward's teachers will be featured in a segment of "Is This A Great State or What," on KFOR Channel 4 in Oklahoma City. The segment is scheduled for the 5 p.m. broadcast on Monday, May 4.

 The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) collaborated to create new outdoor recreation guidelines for use during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 These guidelines apply to both recreational facilities and the public and are based on Gov. Walz's emergency executive order allowing for safe outdoor recreation. Following these guidelines will help protect Minnesotans from this health threat. The public can enjoy the outdoors while doing their part to slow the spread of COVID-19.
 What follows are some guidelines the public should observe whenever outdoors:
 ‒ Practice social distancing (stay at least six feet from people from other households). This isn't just for parks and trails - it is also essential at boat launches, fishing piers and hunting lands, as well as anytime you leave home.
 ‒ Stay as close to home as possible. This is not the time to be traveling long distances to recreate. Cherished outdoor traditions further from home will be there for the public at a later date, after the public health situation has eased.
 ‒ Do not host or attend gatherings with people who aren't members of your immediate household. This includes gatherings like outdoor cookouts or barbecues, because those types of gatherings could spread COVID-19.
 ‒ Explore the range of nearby public lands available to you.
 ‒ Those who arrive at a park, water access site or other public recreation land and see that it is busy are being encouraged to choose a different option. This will allow the public to maintain social distancing and reduce impacts on staff and resources. Also, consider visiting at off-peak times, typically early or late in the day.
 ‒ Do not carpool to outdoor recreational activities with people other than your immediate household, and do not share equipment.

For the last decade, I’ve pretty much only fished one way — with a fly rod, for trout, in moving water.
 When the fly bug bit me back in aught-10, I gradually consigned all my bass, walleye and crappie tackle to the forgotten tub under the table.
 Now, all the spinning and baitcasting reels, plastic worms, spinnerbaits, half-ounce sinkers and spools of heavy line seemed so unfamiliar to my eyes they might as well have belonged to someone else.
 I picked up one of the numerous worm boxes and looked inside. Soft plastic baits of myriad shapes and colors filled each compartment. I picked up a black-and-brown striped model with a swimming tail and a snakelike head. It was a gift from my old friend, Billy Proctor.
 Bill was a fixture at McDowell High basketball games for decades, occupying his usual spot in the highest row of bleachers, right in front of my press table. Over the years, we talked a little about hoops and a lot about fishing.
 One night, I regaled him with a story about catching a bass the previous summer that still had the remnants of its most recent meal — a foot-long water snake — in its mouth. Billy smiled and confirmed he had seen the same thing a couple of times.
 At the next home game, Bill walked up and handed me a grocery bag filled with several dozen plastic worms. He explained they were made to order for him years ago by a gentleman in Georgia. The worms, with alternating black and brown markings and a decidedly serpentine profile, were dead-ringers for the northern water snakes ubiquitous in local waterways.
 Billy died in 2018 at the age of 85. I wouldn’t sell you that bag of snakey- looking worms for a million dollars.
 Another tackle box held hard lures; cranks and jerk-baits and top-waters in all kinds of colors, some mimicking natural prey items and others that resemble absolutely nothing in a fish’s world.
 It certainly seems counterintuitive to think of catching a fish on any bait in the “fire tiger” pattern. Nonetheless, the gaudy plug — bright green back, yellow stripe in the middle, flame-orange belly, vertical black slashes along the side — is a staple of many an angler’s arsenal.
 Legendary Finnish lure manufacturer Rapala makes its flagship bait, the original floating minnow, in fire tiger. I picked up one of several in the box and gave it a long look. It was that particular bait I needed if I wanted to catch walleye in the Catawba River during their annual early-spring spawning run. Specifically, I needed the bait in size 11, 4 3/8 inches long.
 That’s the exact lure my buddy Keith Austin advised me to purchase back in the mid-90s. Keith had been pursuing walleyes for several years, and had settled on the fire tiger Rapala as his go-to bait. Keith got me started on river walleye fishing, which is largely an after-dark proposition.
 We spent many cool, March evenings wading the Catawba and slinging those big old Rapalas downstream and across current. It was, and still is, some of the most exciting fishing I’ve done. In the darkness — walleyes are extremely light-shy and are thus more active in low-light conditions — your vision is pretty much useless, so your other senses are amplified. When a nice fish strikes, it feels like a dump truck on your line.
 One night on the river, Keith hooked up with a monster. Forget dump trucks — this was more like a fully loaded semi.
 Thanks to me, we never got to see it.

This reading also helps explain the timeframe of the show, which kicks off in the early 1960s, when these power structures underwent new scrutiny and were contested. "In the postwar period, across the board we began to relook at how society was ordered," says Pardo. "We had the civil rights movement, the women's liberation movement, a raised class consciousness, and the re-entry of women into the workplace. All this began to destabilise what had been seen from the 19th century through to the Second World War. What you had in the 1960s was this moment when all of these groups, these different taxonomies of people, began to say, 'Hey, we have rights, and we want to enter those spaces, and we have a right to enter those spaces'."

Competition often keeps prices in balance in the long term. However, each animal has different growth times, so production settings may vary. Chicken prices are those that adjust more quickly and easily to demand due to the short period of growth of these animals. Pork prices take a little longer and beef prices take longer. "

Ci sono, su tutte, le esigenze che richiamano alla tutela della salute pubblica. Poi, ci sono le esigenze di chi ha bisogno di tornare a lavorare (che non tutti hanno lo stipendio fisso che corre a fine mese) e, in ultimo, solo in ultimo, ci sono perfino le tattiche della politica. E invece ci sembra che in questa faccenda delle limitazioni imposte a chi ha dirtitto di tornare in Sicilia, perche ha residenza o domicilio nell'Isola, le tattiche della politica abbiano incredibilmente preso il sopravvento. Il presidente della Regione Nello Musumeci stamattina e andato in televisione e ha detto che a suo parere la "blindatura dell'Isola deve durare almeno fino a fine maggio". Per carita, il presidente- anche se il momento consiglierebbe altri comportamenti- ha tutto il diritto di goiocare la sua partita politica e, dunque, di indossare i panni del governatore-sceriffo. Poi, pero, ci sono le norme. Le leggi e i decreti. Ed e in base a quelle che si decide se e chi puo rientrare in Sicilia a partire da lunedi. E' utile, dunque, provare a mettere ordine. Il decreto del presidente del Consiglio dei ministri dello scorso 26 aprile, quello che fissa i criteri per l'avvio della cosiddetta Fase 2, tra le altre cose autorizza anche gli spostamenti da una regione all'altra per raggiungere il proprio domicilio o la propria residenza.Significa che chi lavora al Nord e risiede nell'Isola- e magari nel frattempo ha perso il lavoro o ha visto scadere il contratto a temine che gli garantiva di mangiare e di pagare l'affitto- puo tornare in Sicilia. Via libera ai rientri, dunque? Non proprio. Perche Musumeci- ritenendo che gli arrivi da altre regioni possano produrre una impennata del contagio finora contenuto al di qua dello Stretto- ha chiesto e ottenuto dal ministro dei trasporti la proroga dell'ordinanza con la quale si limitano ulteriormente i rientri in Sicilia. E cosa prevede questa ordinanza del ministro De Micheli? Intanto, che lo Stretto di Messina possa essere attrarvesrato esclusivamente dagli "appartenenti alle forze dell'ordine e alle forze armate, dagli operatori sanitari pubblici e privati, dai lavoratori pendolari o per comprovate esigenze di lavoro, gravi motivi di salute e situazione di necessita". Gia, questa formulazione lascia spazio a dubbi interpretativi. Chi, in forza del decreto del presidente del Consiglio e nel pieno diritto di tornare al proprio luoghi di residenza, non e forse nella situazione di necessita a cui fa riferimento il decreto De Micheli? In pratica, se un lavoratore che ha perso il posto a MIlano prima del lockdown e che deve tornare a casa sua in Siiclia perche non ha piu come pagare l'affitto, decide di mettersi in macchina, fare tutta l' autostrada del sole e poi traghettare verso Messina, non ha diritto di farlo? Sarebbe tutto da dimostrare. Anche perche poi quella persona andrebbe, come previsto, in quarantena.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held a series of meetings with key cabinet ministers and officials of economic ministries to firm up the second stimulus package to lift the economy reeling under the impact of coronavirus- induced lockdown.
 Home Minister Amit Shah, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, representatives of economic ministries and senior officials, including those from the Prime Minister"s Office and Cabinet Secretariat, were present at the meetings.
 The prime minister also had discussions with key economic ministries such as Agriculture and Farmers" Welfare, and MSME to discuss various issues.
 MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari, earlier in the day, said that his ministry has suggested a relief package to the prime minister and the finance minister for the medium, small and micro sector and exuded confidence that an announcement would be made soon.
 "Chaired a meeting on strengthening our MSME sector, which plays a pivotal role in economic development. There were extensive discussions on ways to make this sector more vibrant, attractive and ready to embrace new opportunities," the prime minister said in a tweet after the meeting.
 During another meeting with regard to the farm sector, various reforms in agriculture marketing, management of marketable surplus, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing the agriculture sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of the statute were discussed.
 The focus was on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco- system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development, an official statement said.
 "Concessional credit flow to strengthen agriculture infrastructure, special Kisan Credit Card saturation drive for PM-Kisan beneficiaries and facilitating inter and intra-state trade of agriculture produce to ensure the fairest return to farmer were some of the important areas covered. Developing e-NAM into a platform of platforms to enable e-commerce was one of the important topics of discussion," it said.
 Discussion also emanated on the possibilities of uniform statutory framework in the country to facilitate new ways for farming which will infuse capital and technology in agrarian economy, it said, adding, the pros and cons of bio- technological developments in crops or enhancement of productivity and reduction in input costs were also deliberated.
 Later, the finance ministry also made a detailed presentation to the prime minister on the state of economy and several initiatives that it plans to undertake to stimulate Indian economy.
 During the deliberations, each ministry made recommendations and possible steps to be taken in the short run to prop up the sector administered by them.
 After a detailed review of each and every sector, a relief and stimulus package will be worked out, sources said.
 The prime minister already had meetings with different ministries including civil aviation, labour and power on Friday. He had detailed deliberation with commerce and industry ministry among others on Thursday with focus on attracting both domestic and overseas investment and revival of small businesses in the country so that the recovery process is hastened.
 During these meetings both the home minister and the finance minister were present along with the minister-incharge of the ministries concerned.
 To mitigate hardships faced by the bottom of the pyramid, the government in late March had announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus package comprising free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash doles to poor women and elderly.
 Sources said the government is thinking of announcing a second dose of relief measures for the vulnerable segment and a stimulus package for the industry shortly.
 In his address to the nation on April 13, the prime minister had expressed concern over problems being faced by poor and daily wagers and farmers.
 "The government has made every possible effort to help them through Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. Their interests have also been taken care of while making the new guidelines," he had said.
 While announcing the package on March 26, the finance minister had said the government will announce more such package depending on the evolving situation.
 To contain the spread of pandemic, the government had first imposed a 21-day nationwide lockdown beginning March 25 and later extended it till May 3. The lockdown shut businesses, stopped air and rail travel and restricted movement of people and goods.
 Beginning May 4, the government has decided to ease certain restrictions including opening of industries for green and orange districts which either have nil or lowest number of cases.
 The easing of restriction of specified districts is till May 17 with strict vigil by the local administration.

By now, hearing the president insult journalists is commonplace. Whether he’s accusing them of peddling fake news, calling them enemies of the American people, or threatening to revoke their Pulitzer prizes, the rhetoric has always been pretty toxic. But in my view, none of those insults is as concerning as his recent attacks directed at Voice of America (VOA), the federal government’s international news and broadcasting agency, founded in 1942 with the goal of combating Nazi propaganda by providing unbiased news and information to countries outside the United States.
 At the end of the day, news providers like The New York Times and CNN are independent media outlets protected by the First Amendment and there are limits to how much Trump can actually retaliate against them. It doesn’t matter how many times he threatens to “open up” libel laws and make it easier to sue media organizations — he can’t without overturning a 56-year-old Supreme Court decision. He couldn’t even successfully revoke Jim Acosta’s press pass.
 But the president can actually have a lasting impact on Voice of America. At the moment, he’s demanding the confirmation of conservative activist and filmmaker Michael Pack to head the organization that oversees VOA, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, and it’s clear that if he gets his wish, he’ll expect Pack to make some major changes to the way the VOA does its job.

An Oklahoma man who robbed an Ardmore bank in October 2019 was sentenced to 147 months of imprisonment in federal prison and three years of probation.
   
 According to an April 29 press release from the United States Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Oklahoma, 22-year-old Zachary Gage Pebley of MaComb, Oklahoma was found guilty of armed bank robbery earlier this year.
   
 The jury trail began on January 21, 2020 and concluded a day later on January 22 with a guilty verdict as a result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ardmore Police Department.
   
 Evidence presented at the trail proved to the jury that on October 15, 2019 Pebley entered the Bank of the West in Ardmore wearing a black hat, sunglasses and a white bandana over his face. He then approached and pointed a gun at a bank teller, demanding that money be placed into a pillowcase.
   
 After receiving the money, Pebley fled from the bank and within minutes was pursued and detained by a bystander who had seen him running from the bank, according to the press release.
   
 In an October 16 interview, Ardmore Police Department Capt. Keith Ingle told The Ardmoreite the bystander pursued and managed to knock Pebley down after thinking he had stolen a purse from a woman.
   
 "He chased him thinking that the guy had stolen a purse from a lady or something because he was carrying something in his hand and the lady was screaming and pointing and he didn't hear what they said," Ingle said. "He just thought that the guy had robbed her so he chased him."
   
 Pebley then got back up, dropping a bag containing over $3,000 in cash, and jumped a nearby fence. The bystander alerted police and less than 30 minutes later, officers with the Ardmore Police Department located Pebley hiding in a back yard and arrested him.
   
 "Armed bank robbery is a serious violent crime which is aggressively investigated, prosecuted and punished," said Melissa Godbold, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Oklahoma City Field Office. "The quick intervention by a good Samaritan led to the apprehension of Mr. Pebley by the Ardmore Police Department. This is an example of how the FBI, our law enforcement partners, and Oklahomans work together to defend their community against those who commit violent crime."
   
 According to the press release, Pebley will remain in custody pending transportation to the designated federal facility at which the non-parolable sentence will be served.
   
 "Alert victims, a willing bystander, rapid response by the Ardmore Police Department, and their thorough investigation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation led to swift justice against the defendant in just over six months following his crime," said United States Attorney Brian J. Kuester. "This investigation and prosecution was a result of teamwork at its finest - local and federal law enforcement agencies working together with the communities they serve and protect."

Editor's Note: The following was submitted by Tod Dimmick.
 The pandemic has affected every community event this spring, including the annual New Life 5K Trail Run, an event that raises more than 20 percent of the New Life Furniture Bank's budget.
 This Massachusetts charity serves nearly 700 households every year, including individuals, families, single mothers, seniors and veterans, as they come out of homelessness. New Life collects high-quality gently used furniture and household essentials that are then made available at no cost to individuals and families in need.
 Faced with the challenge of having to cancel its annual 5K Trail Run, New Life sought creative and safe ways to hold their event, which raises funds that are critical to New Life's ability to serve its clients.
 "The economic impact of COVID-19 is hitting our clients hard," said Rich Purnell, executive director of New Life. He added that, "in the coming months, we anticipate a surge in requests as many families will be displaced from their homes."
 After careful thought, the trail run organizing committee announced a new "virtual 5K." Runners and walkers register the same way they would for a conventional run, at www.newlifefb.org/virtual5k, where they can also create or join a team. Participants create their own 5K route, or use fitness apps like MapMyRun and Strava. Teams or individuals may even choose to row 5K on erg machines, or to bike.
 Entrants complete their personal 5K anytime between April 13 and May 10, and runners and walkers log their times on Racewire. On May 11, results will be posted and awards will be given in traditional categories, as well as in new, creative categories like most creative course.
 Ron Yates, co-founder of the New Life Furniture Bank, said "we recognize that this is a totally new way to do something like this, and that is part of the fun. The Virtual 5K could bring even more people to the event because it is so easy to participate from anywhere, at any time. A team could be made up of family members, high school or college cross country teams looking for fitness and competition, an office group, you name it."
 The organizers also believe that the event offers an important opportunity for supporters who, especially in these challenging times, seek ways to do something positive and proactive while still being safe.
 "Folks joining the Virtual 5K not only support the New Life mission, they also are a welcome part of a community doing something that matters," said Yates. "That's especially important right now. And, running in the virtual 5K is a healthy thing to do. Everyone wins."
 Carmen Luisi of Holliston was the top female runner in the 2019 Trail Run (at age 13), and she's looking forward to the Virtual 5K this time around. "This is a very important cause, even greater now because people are struggling financially with the current pandemic," she said.
 Dan Haley of Wayland said he will run the Virtual 5K this year with his family.
 "My wife and 12 year old daughter and I had a wonderful time at last year's 5K," he said. "With everything in the near term shutting down, we were excited to hear that the New Life event is going virtual. One of our goals as a family as we navigate this strange, temporary reality is to continuously reach out to help others. Another is to keep getting exercise! So this checks both boxes, and gives us something worthwhile and active to do as a family."
 Mark Silva is a partner at the law firm Choate, Hall & Stewart LLP, a sponsor of the event. He plans to run the race for the first time this year.
 "At a time when we're all cooped up in our homes looking for something to do, looking for a way to help," he said, "the 5K is giving us the opportunity to support an incredible organization… while being completely flexible on approach."
 He added, "We plan on doing the 5K as a family this year - my wife will run and I am planning to bike the 5K with the kids."
 Kristin Chisum of Wayland will also run the Virtual 5K again with her son, Luke. "We are thrilled that the race committee has come up with a way for the race to go on," she said. "We live near the woods near Walden Pond so that's where we'll be."
 She added, "I know that we will finish our 5K again this year with a feeling of gratitude - thankful for this group of people that have found a way to change people's lives and have provided this 5K as a way for us to do our own little part."
 Participants in the New Life Virtual 5K will be encouraged to post photos of their participation with the hashtag #NewLifeStillRunning or send an email to trailrun@newlifefb.org.
 The registration page reads, in part, "It is our hope that sharing everyone's fun photos and stories will bring joy to our New Life community and inspire other people far and wide to join the cause."
 The organizers made it clear that they want more ideas from supporters about how to make the event fun and accessible to all. Ideas are coming in already, including filming clips of virtual bystanders cheering on the runners, and asking kids to create colorful yard signs.
 The Medfield-based not-for-profit organization operates a donation center in Walpole, and serves MetroWest and greater Boston.
 To register, go to www.newlifefb.org/virtual5k. Those interested in being a sponsor or making a financial contribution are encouraged to visit www.newlifefb.org.

Kevin De Bruyne may have to consider his Manchester City future should the club's two-season ban from the Champions League be upheld, though he has no immediate desire to leave the club.
 De Bruyne has been in sensational form for City this season, though football seasons across Europe have either been placed on hold or cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis.
 Prior to the suspension of matches, De Bruyne played a starring role as City took a 2-1 lead over Real Madrid in the away first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.
 It remains to be seen whether City will be able to compete in UEFA's flagship club competition over the next two campaigns, with the club having been banned due to breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations.
 Pressed on whether the ban could impact his future at City, De Bruyne suggested a two-year suspension could lead to him considering his options, though he has faith in the club winning their appeal against the sanction.
 "I'm just waiting," said De Bruyne in a video interview with HLN Live. "The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they are almost one hundred percent sure that they are right.
 "That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team. Once the statement is made, I will review everything.
 "Two years [without European football] would be long, in the case of one year I might see.
 "But I'm very happy with City. I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England – for my competitive view the best competition – and I like that.
 "It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What is coming is coming."
 Pep Guardiola's future at City is also in doubt, with the former Barcelona boss' contract set to expire in 2021.
 De Bruyne, though, refuted the suggestion a decision on his next move will depend on whether or not Guardiola remains at City.
 "Not particularly. I think Pep says he will take his year of contract anyway, then his contract ends," De Bruyne said.
 "But I'm not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing. Of course I have already worked with other coaches and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else.
 "But I haven't really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment."
 Reports emerged on Saturday claiming Roberto Martinez had extended his contract as coach of the Belgian national team, a move welcomed by De Bruyne.
 "The choice was his. Maybe he would have done something different if the European Championship was played this summer. But we have a project, which is far from complete. Stopping now would be weird. It seems logical to me that he renews his contract," De Bruyne said.
 "Everyone is happy to stay longer. Why is he a good coach? Well, Martinez has a lot of experience.
 "Tactically, he has learned a lot in England. He let us play in a fixed system, and that works. The team has grown in recent years."

He continued stating, the concerned persons' family members have brought to our notice that all their diagnostic tests have been returned as "negative" and that they have completed their quarantine period but are still unable to return from New Delhi due to sudden, successive extensions of lockdown period, and the consequent absence of any inter-state means of transport.   In this regard, Owaisi also requested the Chief Secretary of Telangana Government, Somesh Kumar stating that is important that the migrants should be allowed to safely return to their families in Telangana.   "I request that this matter is urgently taken up with the Union Government, and necessary steps are taken to ensure that they are issued with a pass to return to Telangana at the earliest," he wrote in the letter to Kumar.

The giant fish smashed the lure and took off straight downstream. Keith’s drag screamed as line peeled off the reel. I crouched beside the bank and waited with the net at the ready.
 Keith hung the fish in a deep pool, but it was headed for the fast-flowing current of a rocky shoal. I figured it would break him off if it got into the heavy water, so I hollered at him to tighten down the drag and try to stop the fish. Somewhat reluctantly, Keith cranked down on the drag, but the fish didn’t stop. There was the sudden, devastating pop of 8-pound test line snapping, and then nothing but the endless drone of the river.
 I felt terrible. Maybe, if I hadn’t given Keith some dubious, if well- intentioned, guidance in the heat of battle, he’d have had a trophy walleye for the wall. Maybe if we had let the fish run and then waded past the riffles into the next pool, we could have tired it out and coaxed it into the net. Maybe. We’ll never know.
 Cancer stole Keith’s life in 2017, unfairly and many decades too early.
 I’ll bet he’s wading a quiet river every night this spring, where all the bites are 10-pound walleyes and your fishing partner never offers poor advice. He’ll be throwing a No. 11, fire tiger Rapala, like the one I held in my hand.
 A pair of small glass jars in the far corner of the tub caught my eye; Berkley Power trout bait. It’s been a long time since that particular substance was packaged in glass instead of plastic, so these were ancient artifacts.
 In the days before I picked up a fly rod, I caught many thousands of trout on the dough-like stuff. It stank to high Heaven and stained your fingers, but boy, did those stocked trout love it.
 I unscrewed the lids of both jars, one of them half-filled with yellow bait and other containing a similar amount of white, and marveled at how the trout- attracting stench had remained intact for all those years.
 The bait had once belonged to my father-in-law, Frank Wilkerson. I found them in his tackle bag after he died in 2013. I have never known, nor will I ever know, a finer man. He was pious and forthright. Lying was anathema to him.
 I spent a lot of time with Frank after I married his daughter back in ’92. In all that time, I only heard him tell one fib.
 Early one morning many years ago on the Cherokee Reservation, Frank was sitting on the bank of the tribal pond, catching trout on every cast with Berkley bait and grinning like a ‘possum as his stringer grew heavier and heavier.
 Not everyone was having similar success, and inevitably, a young angler walked around from the other side of the pond and sheepishly asked Frank what he was using.
 I looked on in amusement as Frank’s innate honesty waged an internal battle with his propensity for jealously guarding his fishing secrets.
 Sure enough, he quickly cooked up some story about a secretive factory in our hometown that made the bait strictly for locals with the right connections and charged us an arm and a leg for it.
 The crestfallen kid shuffled away, his spy mission a failure.
 I frowned at Frank and shook my head in mock disdain. He met my gaze with embarrassment, like a kid caught reaching into the cookie jar, before we both burst out laughing.
 I couldn’t help chuckling again as I placed the jars back in the tub — a treasure chest of memories I hope to open again someday — and slid it back under the table.
