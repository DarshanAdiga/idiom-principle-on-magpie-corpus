Cordoba leads the daily death count with 15, followed by Sevilla with 13, Granada 10, Malaga nine, Jaen six and Almeria and Cadiz with four each.


  As of Friday there are 2,415 people hospitalised with the virus in Andalucia, representing 136 fewer patients than the day before.


  The figures continue to paint the picture of a lowering infection and hospitalisation rate.


  However the death rate is not dropping in the same manner, although it is hoped to begin declining after the weekend as the stricter measures enter their fourth week.

Following the discovery, the Danish government, which had already ordered infected farms to cull their animals, announced the slaughter of all of the country&#39;s 15 to 17 million minks. It also imposed strict restrictions on the 280,000 people living in the regions where the human cases of &quot;Cluster 5&quot; had occurred.

The mutated mink strains are no more contagious or dangerous to humans than other strains of the virus, according to the ECDC. But scientists have warned that minks could become a viral source that could both easily infect people and lead to new mutations. The ECDC has urged member states to beef up testing at mink farms.

Some countries have already banned mink farming, while several major fashion houses such as Chanel and Gucci have stopped using fur, with &quot;fur prices dropping sharply as a result. In fact, fur farming hasn&#39;t been a profitable business for years,&quot; Joh Vinding, head of animal rights association Anima, told Agence France-Presse (AFP).

RNA viruses like the coronavirus that first appeared in China at the end of 2019 regularly mutate without any major consequences. But in early November, experts from Denmark&#39;s infectious disease institute SSI identified a new mink strain, dubbed &quot;Cluster 5,&quot; that had infected 12 people in August and September.

The strain has a mutation in the gene encoding the coronavirus&#39; spike protein, which it uses to enter cells. This concerned experts because changes in this region could affect the immune system&#39;s ability to detect the infection, as many vaccines train the immune system to block the spike protein.
