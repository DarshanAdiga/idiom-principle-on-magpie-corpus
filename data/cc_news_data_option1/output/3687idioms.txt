The belief that organizational dialogues on race are the way to go is widespread. When the Josh Bersin Pulse of HR Survey asked over 800 professionals about what their company could do to increase racial justice, the number-one response was to “encourage and engage in dialogue about systemic racism that holds back minorities and women.” Indeed, the DEI firm Vaya Consulting experienced a 1,500% increase in demand for their services in June 2020, compared to June 2019.

Six months after schools closed amid the coronavirus crisis and with online learning in full swing, tens of thousand of students remain without adequate digital access and school districts in Los Angeles County report they still need nearly 50,000 computers and Wi-Fi hot spots.
 The numbers are a stark reminder that technology access continues to pose a significant barrier to distance learning as schools in Los Angeles County will not be allowed to fully reopen until at least November.
 “I’m very concerned if there’s even a small fraction of students who aren’t accessing, especially when we’re talking about students who are already more vulnerable and disadvantaged,” said Debra Duardo, superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education. “There is already a gap, whether you want to call it an academic gap or an opportunity gap. There is already a gap, and we don’t want that gap to get any larger.”
 The Office of Education, which provides services and financial oversight for the county’s 80 school districts, released the numbers Tuesday, the same day that the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted to approve $14.9 million in spending to help close the technology gap. Duardo’s office had requested the funding based on a survey of needs in local school systems.

 Ige highlighted Hawaii’s new, digital Safe Travels application (mandatory for visitors), which was launched at the start of September as one of those steps toward safely restarting tourism.
 Other protocols, such as a pre-travel testing option in lieu of quarantine, will help streamline the process of preventing new infection from entering the state; but Ige said that the islands’ hotels and tourism-related businesses indicated to him that they’ll likely need at least a month to prepare for reopening.
 This will be the third time that the Governor has pushed back Hawaii’s reopening date in light of COVID-19 conditions and delayed the launch of its travel pre-testing program, which was originally scheduled to go into effect on August 1.
 Addressing the tightened restrictions currently imposed in Honolulu, which saw a surge of COVID-19 cases in August, Ige said that he understands residents’ frustrations with Mayor Kirk Caldwell’s order limiting outdoor activities to individuals only, but he also supports the Mayor’s decision.
 “The Mayor really felt that there needed to be a bright line that they could enforce on beaches, parks and trails, and decided that it should be individuals,” Ige said. The Governor himself has taken to going for solo runs around the State Capitol.
 “It is about changing our behavior in a way that helps us fight the virus. And you know, part of these are for short durations so that we can reduce the number of new cases that we’re seeing,” he said.

Louisville, Kentucky, announced on Tuesday a $12 million settlement with the family of Breonna Taylor and a number of changes in how local officers obtain and execute search warrants, among the largest payouts for a police killing in the nation’s history, according to a Taylor family attorney.
 Louisville police killed Breonna Taylor, 26, while executing a “no-knock” search warrant at her apartment during a drug raid in March that uncovered no illegal substances. The incident has become a driving symbol in the Black Lives Matter movement.
 The settlement, which follows a wrongful-death lawsuit that Taylor’s family filed in May, requires police commanders to approve all search warrant applications that are submitted to a judge, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, a Democrat, said during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Louisville police will also have to conduct extensive risk assessments before applying for a warrant, and when those warrants are issued, the city will require that an EMT or paramedic be there. The city also agreed to hire more mental health experts and pair them with officers who respond to calls.
 “This is probably the largest settlement for police misconduct in the history of Louisville and includes substantial police reform as well,” said Sam Aguiar, a Taylor family attorney.
 The settlement will not affect the ongoing investigation by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican, of whether the officers who raided Taylor’s apartment should face criminal charges stemming from her death. The Justice Department also is investigating the case.

 At the end of 2015, individuals from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups filled more than 10% of board seats in only five of 11 industry categories. Now, they do so in nine industries.

Pilgrim Hall Museum celebrated its 196th birthday in positive fashion.
 Though unable to open its doors because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the museum of all things Pilgrim and Plymouth hosted a cupcake celebration on its front lawn and welcomed its first 21st century artifact into its collection.
 To commemorate the strange year, Executive Director Donna Curtin accepted a pink sport coat worn by Plymouth Town Moderator F. Steven Trifletti during the first virtual legislative meeting in town in its 400-year history.
 Trifletti wore the coat at the Town Meeting in August that was held virtual via online meeting platforms because of the continuing health emergency.
 Trifletti said he wore the colorful coat to "strike a positive tone" on a historic occasion, noting it was the only legislative session without in- person debate since passengers on the Mayflower hashed out the Mayflower Compact in 1620.
 "Today we're in the midst of a Covid-19 pandemic and for the first time in our history, our civil body politic has changed from 400 years of in-person debate and deliberation to remote participation with videoconferencing platforms," Triffletti said.
 Curtin said that coat is a special addition to the museum's collection.
 The archives include wide-ranging and rare artifacts that date to the Pilgrims as well as the Wampanoag people who made their homes here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Mayflower.
 But the museum also documents the ongoing history of the town and has artifacts in its collection from throughout the last four centuries. The coat is the first 21st century addition and will be "a beautiful and very symbolic artifact of our life and times right now," Curtin said.
 "Imagine 100 years from now when we are celebrating for the 500th anniversary. People may be bringing this jacket out and remembering what we all lived through in this strange and usual 2020 year," she said.
 Pilgrim Society board President Don Brown said Town Meeting served as inspiration for the Society to hold its first virtual meeting with equal success last week.
 The Pilgrim Society is celebrating its 200th birthday this year. It was formed in January of 1820 and then built the museum. The group traditionally marks the museum's birthday on Sept. 1, when the cornerstone of the museum was laid in 1824.
 The Pilgrim Hall traditionally opens its doors to the general public for the day but remains closed this year until safety protocols and precautions are in place to open under the state's Covid-19 guidelines.
 Curtin said that while it is heartbreaking to be closed, cupcakes are always a good way to go when times are dark. She said the museum expects to reopen sometime before Thanksgiving.

"What I really was impressed with is how she kept in contact with all her students for so many years — from Davidson and from Salem College," Di Napoli- Mylet said. "She did some incredible photography and made jewelry. She was very warm. Once you were her friend, she was always a friend, and she kept up with you.
 "She was a great supporter to me of my art."
 Thomas worked for Di Napoli-Mylet on the People of Winston-Salem Art Reclamation Program, aka POWAR, a summer program that taught art to 14-18-year-olds. The program created several murals throughout the city, including one on the corner of Acadia and Holyrood streets. It features self- portraits of all who worked on it, including Thomas.
 "I was amazed at how she could corral kids and get them to sit up and listen," Di-Napoli-Mylet said. "She was really a great teacher."
 In 2000, Thomas taught darkroom photography to artist Amanda Sullivan at the Sawtooth.
 "She could frustrate and inspire you in the same breath," Sullivan said. "She believed that everyone could be creative and helped so many to find their spark. Above all else, she loved freely and encouraged everyone to believe in themselves."
 Sullivan said that Thomas helped her find a job as coordinator of the photography department that she held from 2011-16.
 Thomas' work has been displayed throughout the community at Studio 7, Associated Artists of Winston-Salem at Milton Rhodes Center for the Arts, Salem College, the Sawtooth, Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center; and in public and private collections throughout the Southeastern United States.
 "The outpouring of support from the community has been a solace," Elizabeth Thomas said. "I know how many people loved her, and they loved her well. It was my privilege to be her daughter."
 In the spring, Elizabeth Thomas hopes to have a gallery event that will establish a scholarship in Mary Bailey Thomas' name for Penland School of Craft.

Shops have tools, cords, and other stuff that needs to be hung up. But once in a while, I find that I need temporary hanging if I'm working remotely or in the middle of a project. Enter the Heroclip Carabiner Clip and Hook.
 Heroclip is a 3-in-1 carabiner and hook that can hang just about anything just about anywhere. This version is their medium size which can hold up to 60 pounds however Heroclip makes a small and a mini version as well for smaller items. Each Heroclip features a rubber tip on the hook that creates a phenomenal grip so your stuff stays secure. And they come in a variety of colors to match your style.
 The hook and clip nest together when not in use with a gate clearance of 1-1/2 inches. Dimensions when open are 3 inches by 3-3/4 inches. Each Heroclip is made of aircraft-grade aluminum and weighs just two ounces. These aren't made for climbing (DON'T USE THESE FOR CLIMBING) but hanging your gear in the shop, garage, house, car, or shed? Heroclips work just great, thank you very much.

 Now we know the president lied to America concerning COVID. And no matter how he tries to spin it, he cost America tens of thousands of lives. His excuse about not wanting to induce panic falls flat.
 His job is to protect Americans and our way of life, not lie in order to try to get re-elected. But he doesn't care about the average American. Americans would have risen to the challenge if we had been told the truth. By his lack of actions he is literally killing us.
 Coming from a long history of Republicans, this is appalling and disgusting to say the least. Since he isn't man enough to resign over this, we must vote him out.

Deputies with the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office are being trained to speak up when they see a coworker breaking the law or department policy  through a course in officer intervention training.          Mike Siegfried, president of The Verbal Judo Institute, is teaching a program for deputies over two sessions this month and next focusing on communication in difficult situations.          Officers failing to act to stop their peers from misconduct is thought to be one of the factors responsible for fatal police encounters in the U.S. In May, three Minneapolis officers watched for more than eight minutes as an officer knelt on the neck of Black man George Floyd and appeared to do nothing to stop it.          A number of police agencies in Oregon now have their own “duty to intervene” policies and this year, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 4205, establishing a police officer’s “duty to intervene” when  witnessing another officer engage in misconduct.          Given the new legislation and the national conversation around police misconduct, many agencies are crafting policies or reinforcing existing ones with training, according to Eriks Gabliks, director of the state police academy in Salem.          An officer’s duty to intervene is one aspect of the larger law enforcement issue of conflict deescalation, Gabliks said.          “Deescalation isn’t just communication,” Gabliks said. “It starts when we arrive somewhere. It could be keeping our distance from someone, or how we approach somebody and interact with them.”          Officers of the Portland Police Bureau will be trained through a program called ABLE, Active Bystanders in Law Enforcement, which was developed by the Georgetown University law school.          Bend Police Department held intervention training  and reporting following the special legislative in June. Spokeswoman Lt. Juli McConkey said staff regularly trains in de-escalation and crisis intervention, which his more focused on intervention in a high stress situation or for people in a crisis.          An earlier attempt by  Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office to hold  officer intervention training was upended when the sheriff’s office consultant, Greg Walker, came under fire for hostile and offensive social media posts. At the time, Walker described his training as a Verbal Judo Institute course.          Sheriff Shane Nelson has been criticized for going around the county’s public bidding process to offer Walker, his friend,  the $8,000 contract to hold the training.          This week, Siegfried sought to distance his group from Walker.          “He has no affiliation with us other than he co-authored a book with our late founder in 2007,” Siegfried said in an email to The Bulletin. “We have crafted our program to fill the expressed needs of our client. It is our training not Mr. Walker’s.”          Siegfried also disagreed with an assertion by Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel that Verbal Judo supports a “warrior mentality” in law enforcement, though he agreed that mindset was inappropriate in law enforcement.          “Police should be guardians not warriors,’ Siegfried said. “After all, police and all first responders are also members of the community. They are mothers, fathers, sons and daughters and every first responder returns to the community when their work shift is completed and when they retire.”          Siegfried said Verbal Judo is focused on demonstrating dignity and respect for all people. He defended the group’s name.          “A study of the word “judo” can be revealing to our approach,” Siegfried said. “’Ju’ in Japanese means gentle and “do” means way. Verbal Judo is the gentle way of communicating with another human being. We think the world could use a lot more of that right now.”

HUNTINGTON — No injuries were reported after several Cabell County volunteer firefighters battled a fully involved structure fire along U.S. 60 just outside of Huntington city limits Monday evening.
 The fire was reported just before 8 p.m. Monday in the 4500 block of U.S. 60 near Huntington at a house between Jolly Pirate Donuts and the Traveler’s Motel.
 Andrew Frazier, deputy chief of the Barboursville Volunteer Fire Department, said firefighters have not discovered an exact cause of the fire or where it started in the house, which they believe to have been abandoned at the time of the fire. Frazier was unsure Tuesday morning if the incident had been turned over to the state fire marshal’s office for investigation.
 Firefighters faced difficulty Monday evening as they attempted to control traffic on U.S. 60 to make room for the fire trucks and shut down the road to run fire hoses to a nearby hydrant across the five-lane roadway.
 “They were slow to turn because they were trying to get their phones to video it,” he said. “Some people don’t think of the bigger picture of, ‘Something is on fire and I need to get (out of) the way.’”

What lessons have been learned? What lessons will be taught? What past experiences can be put to good use to prepare for what's down the road?
 All these questions and more were on the minds of leaders this week as they returned to work after the extended Labor Day weekend, staring at the reality of time and the fact that the dreaded "fall resurgence" could actually be right around the corner.
 "There's a lot of scenario planning going on," Gov. Charlie Baker said last week, confronted with the possibility that the days of sub-1-percent positive testing rates may be numbered.
 Those scenarios include making sure hospitals that survived the first wave of coronavirus without getting overrun are prepared again. And that the state's testing labs are ready to handle the increased volume that could come from more college and grade school students getting tested, as well as people confusing symptoms from fall colds and the old-fashioned flu with COVID-19.
 CommonWealth magazine reported that Partners in Health, which runs the state's contact tracing program, is staffing up for the fall, and some outbreaks cropped up on campuses like Boston College's.
 But for now, the trends remain positive, even if the number of communities in the highest risk "red" category climbed by five to 13 this week. Some of that was explained by a cluster of restaurant staff in Chatham. And high schoolers in Dedham getting together to watch the Bruins playoff run.
 But even those isolated cases can have consequences. Just look at the spread from one wedding in Millinocket, Maine. The puck party in Dedham was enough to force that town to cancel its plan to begin phasing in students for in-person learning on Sept. 21 after a remote start next week.
 Secretary of State William Galvin too said he learned a few things from the first go-around with mail-in voting that he hopes to apply in November, including the need for more uniform ballot counting procedures, but he won't be asking legislators for any changes to the law. What he has asked the administration for is more than $1 million to cover the cost of mailing another round of applications and ballots.
 The unofficial end of summer also meant rethinking how some of the creative steps taken to allow the economy to begin to recover in the warm weather can be extended to chillier autumn days and nights.
 Baker visited Medford's Bistro 5 on Thursday to announce that he was doubling the size of the Shared Streets and Spaces grant program from $5 million to $10 million to help restaurant owners like Vittorio Ettore afford modifications like heat lamps to extend the life of their new outdoor patios.
 The governor also said that while the going was good he was prepared to allow outdoor and indoor arcades to reopen starting next week, a change to the reopening plan that came after the owner of the Salem arcade Bit Bar sued the administration, questioning why his business was being treated differently than casinos.
 That's not to say that's the whole reason Baker decided to open arcades. But the courts are starting to become that player off the bench who just may have an outsized impact on the final outcome of the game.
 U.S. District Court Judge Mark Wolf declined to intervene after a group of landlords sued over the state's moratorium on evictions and foreclosures on constitutional grounds. But the judge gave Baker more to think about over the next month when, according to the lawyer for the plaintiffs, he indicated that the ban's shelf life may be coming to an end.
 The landlord's attorney Richard Vetstein said Wolf made clear that the ban's utility as a measure to control the spread of COVID-19 is not indefinite, especially if the state continues to succeed in driving down infection rates. Baker faces a decision over whether to extend the moratorium beyond Oct. 17, and he'll have to factor the court's into his thinking.
 With a possible return to Housing Court on the horizon for landlords and renters, a group of major health care providers and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh amplified calls to guarantee tenants facing eviction the right to counsel. Hard to see Michelle Wu argue against that, if as Walsh said last week to great controversy, the popular city councilor is planning to run for mayor next year.
 The Supreme Judicial Court also sat this week to hear arguments in a variety of cases, including one involving prisoners seeking release because of the threat of COVID-19 in incarceration.
 The must-see-court-TV had to wait until last Friday, though, when the SJC heard oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by small-business owners, church leaders and educators that put Baker's entire body of work during the pandemic up for judgment. The plaintiffs say Baker's executive orders aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 overstepped his authority under the Civil Defense Act, and a ruling in their favor could negate everything from forced business closures to gathering size-limits.
 Needless to say, the outcome of the case will have broad implications for executive power beyond this pandemic, including any future public health crises.
 A week before that case was heard, Chief Justice Ralph Gants, 65, suffered a heart attack. He announced the health scare himself last Tuesday in a statement released by the court, indicating that he expected to make a full recovery after a surgery to insert two stents, but would be limited in his ability to judge cases for a time.
 Justice Frank Gaziano on Friday said that while Gants would not be participating in oral arguments, he would be following the proceedings and helping to decide cases. Gants, however, died on Monday.
 While not a court, per se, the Commonwealth Employment Relations Board also fired a shot across the bow of teachers unions when it ruled against the Andover Education Association, finding that teachers who refused to enter school buildings and classrooms on Aug. 31 for back-to-school safety training had participated in an illegal strike.
 It didn't matter, the board said, that teachers deemed the school buildings unsafe and set up in school yards outside with laptops and prepared to work. They don't have the authority, the CERB decided, to decide where they report for duty.
 Baker said he agreed with the decision, and that there was nothing unsafe about returning to a "basically empty" school building for professional development.
 But Massachusetts Teachers Association President Merrie Najimy lit into the governor and his administration for not starting school remotely this fall, and said the ruling would not stop teachers in other communities from doing what they needed to do to protect themselves.
 With students in many communities prepared to either return to the classroom or fire up their Zoom rooms next week, the back-and-forth between local unions, school committees and the administration all point to a tense week to come and uncertainty about how much learning will actually be taking place.

Gold Coast and Darling Downs residents will be able visit aged care homes and hospitals again after Queensland went a fourth day without further community transmission of COVID-19.
 Deputy Premier Steven Miles says people living in those regions will be allowed to gather in groups of up to 30, as opposed to the 10 previously, without a COVID-19 safety plan. Only 10 people are allowed to gather in Brisbane, Ipswich and Logan.
 Just one new virus case has been recorded since Saturday and that person was already in hotel quarantine.
 "That's designed to give just a sense of how we are getting on top of those clusters, particularly on the south side of Brisbane and the Ipswich area," Dr Miles said.
 "It's very, very good work."
 The deputy premier said the government would also lift its mandatory PPE requirements for hospital visitors on the Gold Coast and in the Darling Downs, but individual hospitals will still have the final call.
 He said NSW and Victoria were making progress but sadly there were eight deaths in the latter state overnight, more than the six Queensland had recorded since the pandemic began.
 Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young is also reportedly considering a rule change that will require NSW to go just 14 days, rather than the current 28 days, without community transmission of COVID-19 before Queensland reopens the border.
 Dr Young says she won't rush "a critical decision" when the border restrictions are reviewed at the end of the month.
 "We're still concerned that in the past four weeks there have been 14 cases in NSW of which the cause of transmission is unknown," she told AAP in a statement on Wednesday.
 "For a lot of people at home, it might seem like the pandemic is almost over but in reality, Monday was a record day worldwide for COVID-19 cases.
 "We've all done so well to protect Queensland and we can't let our hard work and sacrifices go to waste by rushing a critical decision."
 The state's Labor government has been under sustained pressure from federal, interstate and local political rivals to ease border restrictions since the pandemic began.
 A relaxation of the criteria could allow Queensland to reopen to NSW and the ACT much quicker than previously thought, and potentially in time for Christmas.
 It could also make it easier for the federal government to get its proposed national hotspot system up and running.
 Under the current rules Queensland's border is closed to visitors from NSW unless they live in a border region or have an exemption on economic or compassionate grounds.
 All visitors from NSW, the ACT and Victoria have to go into mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival in Queensland.
 Queensland has no restrictions on visitors from South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania or the Northern Territory.

 Yet the deal now looks to be off, with Aulas declaring Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu personally told him the Catalan giants were in no position to make an offer.
 In a Twitter message, Aulas pointed to a report from Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that suggested a 30 million euros move for the 26-year-old was in the offing.
 Aulas wrote: "The president of Barca indicated to me on Sunday that Barca were suffering a lot from the COVID crisis and didn't have the possibility to make an offer. #memphis"
 Bartomeu recently said Barcelona faced losing around 30 per cent of their budgeted income because of the coronavirus pandemic, with that figure likely to equate to somewhere close to 300 million euros.

 This shovel gives you your original shovel point then adds another one but then, in a brilliant moment of design, also includes a reversed point that takes advantage of the downward spearing motion to sever roots and dirt. The top of the head features reinforced edges for your feet to really plow down through what you're digging through.
 The shovel head is made of powdercoated carbon steel to last many, many years. And take a look at the top of that handle with the circular handle to reduce fatigue on your hands and wrists; it's like a shovel from Middle Earth. Radius Garden also makes an XL version as well as an edger that takes advantage of this design so you can really get some work done.

PEORIA -- The IHSA says it is game on -- make that more games on -- for high school teams sorting through the competition rules and regulations amid a pandemic.
   
 Change is good, albeit often in the COVID-19 era.
   
 The IHSA has lifted its competition restrictions that limited winter, spring and summer sports to two games per week, rolling back to normal schedule limits.
   
 And the summer season, which involves baseball, softball, boys track and field, girls soccer, boys volleyball, lacrosse and boys tennis, can begin practices and games two weeks earlier than previously announced.
   
 For now, anyway.
   
 "We were limited to two matches per week," Dunlap volleyball head coach and Central Illinois Elite Volleyball Club director Jennifer Bartlett said. "I think adding back a significant number of matches would be very doable for us. But that will be up to our school officials. Do we add matches and then there's going to be another change later?
   
 "I'm not looking at it too much. It's like every day they change something. For the longest time I had to wait to see if there was going to be a season.
   
 "I don't know what's going to happen next. None of us do. I'm done with worrying about it.
   
 "This IHSA adjustment is a positive thing, but as always, the key word is 'If.' "
   
 That was somewhat echoed by Peoria High girls basketball head coach Meechie Edwards.
   
 "Things change so rapidly with this pandemic," he said. "It's been a rollercoaster. But I'm excited to get these changes. We just don't know what's next. It might change again next week. So we're just going to do what we can.
   
 "We have six or seven freshman coming into the team, good players. But those freshman didn't have summer development because of COVID shutdowns, and that will be difficult for them. More games will certainly be important for them. We have a chance to be really, really good."
   
 Lewistown softball coach Joey McLaughlin sees the two weeks added as dodging what felt like a repeat of last season's COVID shutdown as the IHSA's initial plan struggled to jam in multiple sports into its 2020 summer lineup.
   
 "That's one thing that I will say that I was happy with to get the extra two weeks, considering we were shorted an entire season last year and then (the IHSA was) going to try and short our season again this year," he said. "I was happy with those two weeks."
   
 As for summer sports, the original COVID-adjusted competition plan was for first practices on May 3 and first contests on May 17.
   
 That has been moved ahead now to April 19 and May 3, respectively.
   
 It's a chance for kids to play more games, especially in baseball and softball.
   
 "It's a great benefit," said Notre Dame baseball coach Cory Birdoes. "Basically what it does, it allows us to have somewhat of a season, develop players, see players, give them at-bats, things that they missed out on the last couple of years.
   
 "Adding games isn't going to hurt."
   
 And what about the overlap of spring and summer sports?
   
 "I'd rather have my kids play other sports anyway," Birdoes said. "It just makes them a better athlete."
   
 It could, however, be a challenge for coaches.
   
 "For my own personal reasons, I'm still trying to wrap playing in June around my brain," Farmington softball coach Jeni Fauser said. "I don't want to go through like last year where the seniors didn't get to play, so I'm glad there's a season.
   
 "There's still a lot of sacrifices being made by coaches and players to do this.
   
 "We share a lot of the athletes. I'm afraid some kids will just think, 'If (softball) is not my No. 1 sport, do I really want to go into something else?' Especially if they've played basketball, volleyball, then boom (softball)."
   
 The extra two weeks and the lift of weekly competition limits should help track and field, too. But is it too little, too late?
   
 "I think it is great to give the kids a chance to possibly compete in more meets and this may give us a chance at having a state series," Richwoods boys track and field coach Roland Brown said. "I think we are in a bit of a tough situation with half the season being conducted when school is not in session, I would guess numbers will be affected.
   
 "Most of us will probably be doing some type of pre-season training before April any way."

GLENHAYES — A game many thought wouldn’t happen this year found it’s way back on the schedule after all, and for the first time a rivalry will be rekindled in southern Wayne County.
 The Wayne Pioneers and Tolsia Rebels’ football teams will meet on the gridiron Friday night for a game that was lost and then regained because of COVID-19.
 The two squad were scheduled to play their season opener at Wilt Salmons Athletic Field at Tolsia High School on Aug. 28, however a decision by the WVSSAC to delay the start of the regular season cancelled that date.
 The matchup only became possible this week because each of their respective opponents, Winfield for Wayne and Tug Valley for Tolsia, were unable to play because of community spread of the virus in Putnam and Mingo counties.
 Wayne County, which was Orange last week, was kept from competition but allowed to continue practices while the number of confirmed cases of the virus rose. As the daily positive rate of new cases fell, the county switched back to Yellow on the color-coded model WV is using to measure community spread.
 With an open date on both schedules, and a strong desire to get a game in while they can, the rescheduled game just made since for both schools, who will meet in football for the first time since 2017.
 It will be just the third meeting between Tolsia and Wayne since the Rebels were moved down from Class AA to Class A as a result of West Virginia Secondary Schools Athletics Commission reclassification after the 2015 season. The two met each year as members of the Cardinal Conference prior to the move.
 Wayne has wins in 15 meetings since the 2004 season, including a 33-6 win over Tolsia in the Class AA State Championship game in 2006 in Wheeling. The Rebels won the regular season meeting earlier that season. Tolsia has won two of the past three head-to-head matchups in 2015 and 2016. The most recent meeting in 2017 was a 30-6 victory at home for the Pioneers.

If you though prefer the open-source graphics drivers, that's where NVIDIA remains in a much more difficult place for the time being. To this day the best open-source NVIDIA driver support remains with the GeForce GTX 600/700 "Kepler" graphics cards over no firmware restrictions and being able to re- clock the graphics cards to their factory rated frequencies. Albeit that re- clocking is still done manually but at least interested users can still hit their peak performance states and deliver closer to the proprietary driver performance. For the GeForce GTX 900 series and later, due to PMU firmware restrictions and the like at the moment, the Nouveau driver is stuck to running at the clock frequencies programmed at boot time that are generally severely limited (a few hundred Megahertz).

The area roughly halfway between Cleveland and Columbus remains mostly agricultural. But there's a catch, as I discovered when I sat down and talked to three generations of farmers: Ray Hall, 80; son Keith, 56; and Keith's boy Andy, 28, who grow nearly 2,000 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat just down the road from my in-laws. They can think of only a couple of other families who depend solely on agriculture to make a living. Andy knows of only two high school classmates who went into full-time farming.

In addition to the individual bilateral agreements signed by Israel, the UAE and Bahrain, all three will sign a trilateral document, officials said. The agreements are dubbed the "Abraham Accords" after the patriarch of the world's three major monotheistic religions. Trump is expected to sign as a witness.
 The agreements won't end active wars but will rather formalize the normalization of the Jewish state's already warming relations with the two countries. And, while not addressing the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they may pave the way for a broader Arab-Israeli rapprochement after decades of enmity, a pair of wars and only two previous peace deals.
 Skeptics, including many longtime Mideast analysts and former officials, have expressed doubts about the impact of the deals and lamented that they ignore the Palestinians, who have rejected them as a stab in the back by fellow Arabs. Netanyahu has insisted that Israel's plans to annex West Bank settlements is only suspended and remains on the table.
 Yet even the harshest critics have allowed that the agreements could usher in a major shift in the region should other Arab nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, follow suit, with implications for Iran, Syria and Lebanon. Other Arab countries believed to be close to recognizing Israel include Oman, Sudan and Morocco.
 "These agreements are a huge accomplishment for the countries involved and have led to a tremendous sense of hope and optimism in the region," said Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who led the negotiations. "Instead of focusing on past conflicts, people are now focused on creating a vibrant future filled with endless possibilities."
 The Palestinians have not embraced Kushner's vision.
 A poll released Tuesday found that 86% of Palestinians believe the normalization agreement with the UAE serves only Israel's interests and not their own. Fifty-three percent of Palestinians described the agreement as a "betrayal" while 17% said it marked the "abandonment" of their cause.
 The poll, carried out by the respected Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, found that 92% of Palestinians are opposed to Trump's Mideast plan. The poll, carried out Sept. 9-12, surveyed 1,270 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.
 Palestinian activists held small demonstrations Tuesday in different parts of the West Bank and in Gaza, where they trampled and set fire to pictures of Trump, Netanyahu and the leaders of the UAE and Bahrain.
 Trump remains undeterred, telling "Fox & Friends" on Tuesday that the Palestinians are "difficult" to deal with. Eventually, he said, "Palestinians will be brought in because all of their supporters, all of the people that give them lots of money are coming into the deal so otherwise they'll be left out in the cold."

Board members have a lot of power because they are ultimately responsible for directing companies. A board approves a company’s strategy and most important goals, hires the chief executive and determines how much it will pay senior executives. A special board committee nominates new members and, as a result, has the power to make boards more diverse by seeking out candidates who are not white men.
 A lot of power also rests with the big investment houses that vote in board elections through the shares they own and manage. Some, like Larry Fink, the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager, have spoken about “the critical importance of diversity and inclusion.”
 Lawmakers could also act. The California Legislature recently passed a bill that would require companies with headquarters in the state to have at least one board member from an underrepresented ethnic group, or who identifies as gay, bisexual or transgender, by the end of 2021. A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to say if he intends to sign the bill. (The measure is modeled on a 2018 California law that requires companies to appoint at least one woman to their boards.)
 Pedro Pizarro, chief executive of Edison International, a large electric utility in California, said the reaction to the killing of Floyd seemed to have led to more serious conversations about racism within companies. “In my 55 years of being around, this is a very different feel to the discussion — and that’s encouraging,” he said.
 Pizarro and West said having a diverse group of corporate leaders was not just the right thing but also good for the health of businesses. Some studies have found a link between diversity and corporate profits, for example.
 West, who advises Uber’s board but is not a director, said having people from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups on boards helped executives better understand how to win the business and loyalty of customers.

To the Editor:
   
 I am a proud Winnacunnet High School graduate of 1986. I find myself both saddened and disgusted by the thought that anyone would remove the image of Our Warrior from the school. I say "Our Warrior" out of respect for what he represents to anyone who attended the school, and for the people from which he came. Our Warrior has never been represented in a disrespectful way. I feel that those people who want his likeness removed have absolutely no clue of Our Warrior's history. We have all seen in our lives how ignorance breeds hatred and bad decisions, so let's not follow suit.
   
 As anyone who attended Winnacunnet knows, the school name is from Abenaki descent and means "beautiful place in the pines," but do you know who Our Warrior is? While I attended, I was lucky enough to be taught History by an amazing instructor of French Canadian descent, and she told me the story of who our warrior was.
   
 His name was spelled many ways, but Chief Escumbuit was one of the most famous and honored Abenaki that ever lived. Canadians know him as "an Abenaki chief revered for his bravery, war-strategizing and negotiating skills in dealing with his enemy." He was respected by his people for his bravery, tenacity, dedication, and protection of them and their land. He charged into battles from Maine to Massachusetts and was more successful than any of the "better- equipped leaders" of that time. Because of his legendary efforts, he was also knighted by King Louis XIV and considered one of his greatest allies.
   
 Even though Escumbuit fought with the French against the colonists of the Seacoast, when it came time to determine the best representation of Winnacunnet students, and what we would want them to aspire to be, the town was astute enough to put their own prejudices aside and choose a native, a leader, and a knight that possessed all of the attributes one could hope for in their own children. Honor, bravery, strength, endurance, intelligence, dedication, and respect….This is what Our Warrior represents to those who truly know him.
   
 To eliminate Our Warrior would not only be the wrong thing to do, it would be a travesty and a complete and total disrespect to the Native American Abenaki tribe, and to the memory of a man who dedicated his life to his people. Do not be swayed by the ignorance of those who believe they know the "right thing to do," because of their laziness to learn and reactionary response to what they see. While the world removes parts of our history and will be doomed to repeat it if they are not careful, do not become the people who wiped away the memory and history of Escumbuit, the greatest Warrior of the Abenaki people for which Winnacunnet was named and her students strive to embody.
   
 Proud Winnacunnet Warrior,
   
 Greg Stiles

According to the 1880 article in the Baldwin paper, early census collections listed mainly the men of each household, whereas today, I believe all persons living in each household are listed. In the 1870 census, I'm sure portions of what eventually became Baldwin, WI were included on that census list, though not yet listed as Baldwin Village.
 Their 1880 Baldwin census was likely the first official census taken as a Village, other than special local searches pinpointing citizen counts at the time of its 1871 settlement, and in 1874 at their Village Incorporation time.
 In that 1880 10th National Census, Baldwin Village reported having 591 citizens, while Woodville Village came in at 149. Wish I could see that 1880 census listing to find out if it included names of children and women, as well as the men.
 One of the most interesting tidbits derived from the census news in those 1880 Independent lines was that one family in Georgia had been recorded on the census as having 13 children born, with only 6 different birth dates -- 5 sets of twins, and one set of triplets.
 Imagine that household in 1880 – just hanging on to their children to keep them all in one place long enough to count them. That many multiple births truly was “census noteworthy” in 1880 or anytime. I guess it is not likely any family today would duplicate those few birthday dates with so many children.
 The “census enumerator” mentioned in that 1880 article was the person listing/counting individuals in a certain area in a designated period. I felt privileged to learn of so many census procedures through old Baldwin papers.
 Just recently, my husband and I filled out, on-line, the census report for 2020 rather than on paper. Depending on how well we, and each individual typed it in, we will see if it is easier to later read compared to those 1880 faded “fountain ink-filled” census papers they worked with.
 Apparently our 2020 computer method is a “first” as well, so it, too, being written up in this Baldwin newspaper now, will one day seem “a story written a long time ago”. My how times have changed from those vulnerable, wrinkled pieces of paper carried around by census takers riding horses from one home to another, and walking on foot through Baldwin's streets, raindrops and gusts of wind playfully causing those sheets to become wrinkled, blurry name-filled papers!
 Hope you remembered to file your census papers this year. It's an important record for history, so watch your typed “p's and q's”.
 In the Jan. 6, 1881 issue of THE INDEPENDENT, the following was reported by editor and proprietor, W.D. Acherman. “The superintendent of census gives the approximate population of the states and territories at 50,152,555. This is believed to come pretty close to the exact figures, at least it will not vary a great deal from it. Not more than a couple of million perhaps.”

I first met Cobb County District Attorney Joyette Holmes a few months ago at a luncheon at the Vinings Bank. The occasion was the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Cobb Prayer Breakfast and an opportunity to honor the individuals that had helped start this singular event.
 Even though the pandemic limited attendance to a small group, the Prayer Breakfast has such a reputation that Gov. Brian Kemp took a break from the legislative session to attend. Also in attendance was the district attorney, who was named to that post in July of last year by the governor after he had appointed two-term Cobb DA Vic Reynolds as director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
 Before being named Cobb’s new district attorney, Joyette Holmes served four years as chief judge of the Cobb County Magistrate Court. She was the first African American and first woman to do so.
 I brought Holmes to our table to meet the Woman Who Shares My Name and Carla, who runs the Yarbrough household and all that is within it. As we were leaving, I commented at what a pleasant person the DA seemed to be.
 “Maybe so,” Carla said, “She will give you that smile but there is something stern about her, too. Look in her eyes. They are saying, ‘I don’t mess around.’” Leave it to Carla to see the nuances that I miss.
 I told that story to the DA later and she laughed. “Believe it or not,” she said, “I really don’t like to be adversarial. I would prefer to work things out in a cooperative fashion, where possible.”
 Ten months into her job, she was selected by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr to prosecute the men charged in the shooting death in Brunswick of Ahmaud Arbery, a high-profile and racially charged case that has gotten worldwide attention.
 All of this while operating a 45-attorney department and running for election for a full four-year term this November against Democrat Flynn Broady, Cobb’s assistant solicitor general and a former congressional candidate.
 If her buckets are near overflowing, she doesn’t show it. We had a casual and relaxed breakfast recently and talked about a number of subjects. The Arbery case wasn’t one of them. “There are motions to be filed and hearings to be scheduled. At this point, nothing is imminent,” she said. End of story. I kind of figured that, but I had to ask.
 Joyette Holmes grew up in Valdosta. Her father was a sergeant in the Air Force, stationed at Moody Air Force Base and her mother was a registered nurse. A product of the public schools, Holmes says she was active in the Boys and Girls Clubs, school clubs, sports and was on the dance team for Valdosta High’s Marching Cats, which performed at Friday night football games.
 Her interest in law arose from two interesting sources. One, she participated in mock trials in high school. “I enjoyed the strategy part but not necessarily being in an advocacy role,” she says and admits she was “super shy.” Her other inspiration? Watching the venerable television series, “Law and Order.”
 All of that led her to the University of Georgia and dual degrees in psychology and criminal justice. It was then on to law school at the University of Baltimore before ending up in Cobb County in the solicitor’s office and a short time in private practice.
 After losing a race in 2012 for Cobb State Court judge, she joined the DA’s office. She gives Vic Reynolds a lot of credit for his role in her development. “He saw more in me than I saw in myself and I will always be grateful to him for that,” she said.
 In 2014, Holmes was encouraged to apply for the newly vacant chief magistrate position. She won the unanimous approval of Cobb’s 10 Superior Court judges, served for four years and the rest, as they say, is history.
 While we may have the perception that a district attorney is all about courtrooms and putting bad guys behind bars, there is much more to the job than that. Holmes talks about efforts to reduce opioid deaths, programs to combat elder abuse, gang violence, sex trafficking, victim witness assistance and finding the delicate balance between law enforcement and the community. The list seems endless.
 So, what does this wife and mother of two teenage daughters do in her spare time? “Ask me next year,” she laughed. It seems the rest of this year is pretty much spoken for.
 In case the district attorney is wondering about the future, Carla has the answer, as usual, “She is going to be OK,” says the one who runs the Yarbrough household and all that is within it. “There are some good things out there in her future,” she declares. I didn’t ask Carla how she came to that conclusion. I suspect it was that “I don’t mess around” look behind Joyette Holmes’ smile.

Fairlawn's police chief has died.
   
 Donald Duman, who became chief in 2017, died Sept. 6.
   
 "He was very compassionate about his job and obviously the city and the people that worked for him," said Fairlawn Mayor Bill Roth. "He was professional, and he was a very good man. And he will be missed."
   
 Duman, 66, worked as a part-time officer with the department for more than eight years before becoming chief. He previously spent 25 years as a patrolman, sergeant, lieutenant and commander at the Cleveland Police Department and retired from the Cleveland force in 2004, the Beacon Journal reported when he became chief.
   
 His obituary states that while in Cleveland, he helped develop and implement the Greater Cleveland Drug Court and "spent much of his career standing up for those who needed an extra dose of grace."
   
 He also had worked as an investigator with a private surveillance company in Cleveland.
   
 In Fairlawn, Duman replaced Chief Kenneth Walsh, who retired in 2017 after 20 years with the department.
   
 "This is one of the finest cities I've been around, and I've seen a number of different cities," Duman told the Beacon Journal after being appointed chief. "The integrity of the people and the integrity of the officers is unsurpassed."
   
 Duman's obituary says that "in his final days, Chief Duman fought hard to return to his team, telling all who would listen that he wasn't done yet and how much he loved his team and the people of Fairlawn."
   
 His obituary highlights his extensive law enforcement career, including graduating from the 146th Session of the FBI National Academy, where he completed special coursework in internal affairs and terrorism.
   
 "You should know that I have dedicated my life to law enforcement and the great trust and responsibility the citizens and city administration place on their officers," Duman said about himself as part of his obituary. "As events in the nation and world shape our reality and perception, it is essential that the public trust be maintained for the city administration and citizens alike. I believe the values, compassion, and integrity of an organization is paramount in its efficiency and perception it reflects to the public. I am thankful to have received numerous commendations and resolutions in my honor throughout my career, but am more thankful to have had the privilege to uphold the values of the communities I serve."
   
 Duman's obituary says he was also "an extra class Amateur Radio operator for 46 years, a hobby gardener, a lefty pitcher, a 'tinkerer' who believed everything (tangible or otherwise) could be fixed, a week-long 'Happy Birthday' singer, or a perpetual learner.

 “It’s one of those things you can’t give advice for or against on. There is not a case that specifically supports or is against it,” Myers said.
 Under the terms of the extension, the cost to the borough will increase just under 3.5%, from $14,495 per month to $15,000. Residents will continue to be able to put out five bags and one large item each week. The contract also includes curbside recycling pickup.

Scissors are an often overlooked piece of hardware in any home or shop. A good pair of scissors can save the day whether it's opening blister cases, shipping boxes, or simply cutting paper. These Multi Function 5-In-1 Scissors from AnySharp might be the best pair you ever own and here's why: yes, there are five different tools in one pair of scissors but they cut amazingly well.
 The blades on these scissors are curved to keep your hands away from the material you're cutting and also to improve the angle of your hand so they are kept comfortable for longer periods of time. The blade edges are serrated which help prevent sticking and also cut through most anything including old credit cards, blister packs, sticks, thick layers of cloth or cardboard, and even cooking ingredients like chicken bone (!).
 And besides cutting they can function as a bottle opener, nutcracker, garlic crush, and wire stripper. Made of hardened tempered steel, they also feature large comfort grip handles that are suitable for either left _or_ right-handed use. The adjustable tension bolt allows for the scissors to be tightened if they ever work loose so they'll stay working for years. Plan on putting this pair of amazing scissors on the ol' shop pegboard.

FALL RIVER -- Sean Martin knows what it feels like to be a "non-essential" entrepreneur.
 "I was out of work for nine weeks," the professional barber said.
 It's been nearly three and a half months since he returned to cutting hair at his Whiskey & Steel Barbershop at 202 Bank St.
 "I signed the lease three days before I was allowed to open," in early June, he said.
 Martin, 31, was required to shut the site of his first barber shop business by March 24 after Gov. Baker issued his executive order stipulating that, until further notice, only "COVID-19 Essential Services" involving face-to-face interaction could be delivered -- as a means of minimizing the spread of the coronavirus.
 He says his wife during that time was laid off from her job as an esthetician performing skin treatments and facials.
 Martin says it's fortunate he qualified to collect unemployment payments as part of the federal CARES Act and its Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which was designed to help people who are self-employed, "gig workers"; and independent contractors.
 Martin is the latest tenant of a building that sits at the corner of Bank and Purchase streets and includes the Pink Bean coffee shop, the basement-level St. James Irish Pub and apartments upstairs.
 His shop directly faces the Tequila Lime Cantina restaurant and bar, which he says is a plus in terms of attracting new customers.
 During the previous three years he owned and operated a barbershop he called Buffington Barber Company out of the nearby Buffington Building at 10 Purchase St.
 Martin, who has a 4-year-old son, says his wife's grandfather helped them out by paying the rent on their Somerset apartment while they were out of work.
 "I wouldn't mind him paying a little longer," he joked. "But it's nice being back to work."
 His shop has just two chairs, the second of which Martin says will be used starting in November by barber and hair stylist Kaleigh Pinto.
 Only one customer for the time being is allowed inside, and appointments, which can be made in person or on the phone, are required, Martin said.

CINCINNATI -- When the Cincinnati Reds signed Mike Moustakas to their largest free-agent contract in franchise history last winter, they were expecting him to deliver in moments like Monday.
   
 Trailing by a run in the fifth inning, there were two runners on base and two outs when Moustakas stepped into the batter's box. It was a game the Reds couldn't afford to lose as they continue to sit outside of the playoff picture.
   
 Moustakas, with one swing, changed the outlook on the season. Moustakas drilled a 96-mph fastball over the wall in right-center and his teammates erupted with cheers in the dugout. As Moustakas neared home plate, Eugenio Suarez clapped and put his hands over his head to mimic a Moose.
   
 The Reds swept Monday's doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates with a 9-4 victory at Great American Ball Park. They won the first matchup 3-1 and have now won three games in a row.
   
 As improbable as it seems, the Reds are within one game of a playoff spot.
   
 "It was as excited as I've seen our team," Reds manager David Bell said. "Our team understands, clearly understands, what we're playing for right now."
   
 It was Moustakas' fifth homer of the season and his first against a left- handed pitcher. Shogo Akiyama opened the inning with a single up the middle before Nick Castellanos and Joey Votto struck out on called third strikes. Eugenio Suarez drew a two-out walk versus lefty reliever Nik Turley, which brought Moustakas to the plate.
   
 Turley fell into a 2-0 count against Moustakas before throwing a fastball that caught the middle of the plate. Moustakas didn't miss it. He has a lot of big home runs in his career, including six in the postseason, but it was his most important hit with his new team.
   
 "I was jealous because I wanted to do it," Votto said. "But I was so happy that he did it. It was such a great swing. It's funny. When you play with really good players, you get to sit and just admire. You have moments when you admire and you just think, 'Wow. I'm learning from this. I'm happy to be side by side with this person.'
   
 "Moments like that, swings like that are the reason why we signed him."
   
 The Reds blew the game open when they scored three runs in the sixth inning without a hit. Facing Pirates reliever Geoff Hartlieb, the first six batters in the inning reached base through four walks, a hit batsman and an error.
   
 "Nine runs is a great day no matter how you get them," Moustakas said. "We'll take that every day, especially with the staff that we've got and our bullpen. I like nine."
   
 The Reds lost a lead in the fifth inning, but they avoided disaster. With Archie Bradley warming in the bullpen, the Pirates mounted a quick two-out rally against Anthony DeSclafani. Adam Frazier lined a single into right field. Bell stuck with DeSclafani against right-handed hitter Ke'Bryan Hayes.
   
 The move backfired as Hayes hit a two-run homer to give the Pirates a 4-3 lead.
   
 DeSclafani walked the final batter he faced. Jose De Leon entered instead of Bradley because they were trailing, and he walked two batters before exiting with a groin injury. With the bases loaded, Bell called upon Sal Romano to save the day.
   
 Romano, making his season debut, induced a pop-out against Gregory Polanco to strand three runners.
   
 "To come in, in a situation like that, and get the job done, it's a huge confidence boost not just for him but for all of us," Moustakas said. "That was a huge situation."
   
 The Reds had a shorthanded bullpen after relatively short starts on Saturday and Sunday. Amir Garrett and Lucas Sims were unavailable. Robert Stephenson got hot in Game 1, so he was limited.
   
 Closer Raisel Iglesias warmed up in the sixth inning, before the Reds scored their add-on runs, despite throwing 11 pitches in Game 1 and two innings Sunday. Talk about players giving it their all as they try to fight for a playoff berth.
   
 "I mean there's just nothing like it," Bell said. "To have a chance to go to the postseason is what do this for and dream of, so that's all the motivation you need and that's where our mindset is."
   
 The Reds had a two-run lead in the third inning after Votto blasted a 402-foot solo homer to right-center off Pirates right-hander Mitch Keller. It was Votto's second home run of the day, including his solo homer in Game 1 of the doubleheader, and his ninth of the season.
   
 The solo homer was Votto's 960th RBI in his career, which tied him for fifth on the franchise's all-time list with Hall of Famer Barry Larkin.
   
 "I just think I've got to do better; Barry led off," Votto deadpanned. "You know, I feel really good, and I feel like I have a ways to go, truly. I've done a couple of cool things, they don't register yet, because I really get excited about playing and continuing my career.
   
 "I signed with the Reds for a very, very long time, so if I don't do some things and match up with some names, then I've failed. And I don't think I will."
   
 Tyler Stephenson's two-run, walk-off home run gave the Reds a 3-1 victory over the Pirates in the first game of the doubleheader.
   
 Jose Garcia singled with two outs in the seventh. Two pitches later, Stephenson, pinch-hitting for Shogo Akiyama, hit one out to left to win it. Stephenson's thoughts as he ran the bases:
   
 "Did that just happen?"
   
 Trevor Bauer was doing a postmortem with pitching coach Derek Johnson when Stephenson launched. Bauer had been three outs from a complete-game, one-hit, seven-inning shutout when Colin Moran hit a sky shot out to right to tie the game.
   
 "I was standing next to D.J. going over the game, just hating my life for giving up that homer," Bauer said. "Just like over-analyzing everything about it. Then we get a single. He was on his way upstairs to go take that at-bat. D.J. was like, 'Okay, kid, let it rip.' He was all enthused about it.
   
 "I was hoping for like a front-foot slider, hits him and then (Nick) Castellanos can walk it off or something. I'm just going through every scenario in my head of like how something could break our way.
   
 "And it did. I couldn't be happier for him."
   
 Stephenson, the former No. 1 pick, hit a home run in his first big-league at- bat and threw out Billy Hamilton trying to steal, but this ranks No. 1 on his list of big league memories.
   
 "Everything that's happened this year… like throwing out Billy," Stephenson said. "I don't know. I can't believe everything that's happened. Really."

There is an urban legend involving Adam Scott, Geoff Ogilvy and Ernie Els' private plane that has grown since the 2006 US Open at Winged Foot.
 It goes like this.
 Scott was seated inside Els' jet about to fly back to London. Down the road in New York's Westchester area, Ogilvy had one hand on the US Open trophy as Phil Mickelson, Colin Montgomerie and Jim Furyk were all choking.
 When Scott - 25 and based in London at the time - heard his fellow Australian had won, he walked off South African great Els' plane and caught a taxi back to the player hotel. Partied into the night with Ogilvy and others.
 "I think the story got a bit embellished," Ogilvy told AAP.
 "Scotty was sitting in a car with Ernie deciding whether to go to the airport and turned around. But it sounds better this way. What is true is we went deep on the afterparty and the 5.45am New York City media tour was brutal."
 Scott, one of nine Australians in the field this week for the US Open's return to Winged Foot, insists the story isn't too far off the mark.
 "It's very close to the truth," he said.
 "Geoff had won, he's a good mate and I felt I should come back and celebrate. So, even though I haven't won the US Open, I've drunk out of the trophy."
 But Ogilvy says Scott - who won his 14th US PGA Tour title in February - is ready to emulate his 2006 triumph at Winged Foot, the toughest test on the US Open rota.
 "Scotty's capable and he's proven he can mix it with the big guys in majors," Ogilvy said of the 2013 Masters winner at Augusta.
 Ogilvy rates several of the Australians this week.
 Of the big names, there's Scott's fellow major winner Jason Day. He has two runner-ups at the US Open. Marc Leishman and Cameron Smith have won US PGA Tour titles this year.
 Matt Jones, Lucas Herbert, Curtis Luck, Scott Hend and amateur Lukas Michel round out the Australian tilt.
 "Cam and Leish could win," Ogilvy said. "Jason would've been the overwhelming favourite when he was world No.1 in 2015 and he's always a chance.
 "But right now, the way (world No.1) Dustin Johnson and Jon Rahm have been playing, you'll have to beat one of those two."
 Recent winners Johnson and Rahm, as well as Justin Thomas, Xander Schauffele and Collin Morikawa, are among the younger stars Scott and the Australians are up against at this spectator-less US Open.
 There are veteran US Open winners such as Tiger Woods, a three-time champion, and in-form 2012 winner Webb Simpson.
 But the biggest obstacles will be the narrow fairways, knee-high rough and lightning-fast greens that US Open officials will exaggerate in their set-up of Winged Foot.
 Scott says he is ready for it all.
 "I think I'm still in my prime and most courses fit my game because it's well- rounded, especially now," Scott told AAP.
 "My short game has risen to a level it's never been and my putting has really come of age."
 Ogilvy is optimistic the Australians will be in contention.
 "Australians tend to do well at Winged Foot because of the firm greens; Greg Norman (lost in an 18-hole play-off to Fuzzy Zoeller) in 1984 and me in 2006.
 "It's a short-game specialist's course and Aussies typically have great short games."
 But Ogilvy admits Scott is his pick of the Australians, even if it's sentimental.
 "It would be a storybook win for Scotty if you think back to 2006."

As the adage goes, "home is where the heart is," and for couples who don't want to postpone their big day any longer, looking to friends with backyards or transforming their own outdoor space into a chic wedding venue has become a great option.
 Chances are your new guest list is significantly smaller than originally planned. You can use that to your advantage, from a budget perspective, to make the event even more special than originally planned. An outdoor wedding also can help to ease stress for guests who have reservations about being in a group, no matter how small.
 "Having a wedding at your home feels more relaxed for your guests in a lot of ways," said Kate Reavey, president and owner of Chicago Vintage Weddings. "Maybe they are familiar with your home, but they get to see it in a different light. People really feel like they're coming for an intimate dinner party where all of their needs have been carefully considered, and it's a lot less of a huge production than going to an event and being around hundreds of people," she said.
 Reavey, whose company produces highly personalized, "luxury on any budget events," also produces budget-conscious, all-inclusive mini weddings that provide everything from hair and makeup to catering, photography and on-site event management.
 "When you're having an outdoor wedding at home, you're starting from scratch," she said. "You can spice up the grounds, like adding extra landscaping or a custom arbor that can stay on-site after the event."
 Aside from the all-important task of strategically trying to pick a rain-free day, there are other things to consider. Think about traffic flow. If you have space, designate different areas for various functions, like a table set up with a special mini cocktail for guests as they arrive, a focal point setting for the ceremony, or an area for a relaxing after-party. "When you're later into the season, it's really important to have heating elements when the sun has gone down," said Reavey. "Fire pits can also be a great option for the end of the night if people might want a quiet place to sit and chat."
 Adding lighting from multitudes of candles to pathway lights is also an easy way to transform your space. "If it's in your backyard, to make it really special, lighting is critical," said Marina Birch, principal at Birch Design Studio in Chicago, whose boutique firm has been recognized on a national scale for producing inspired, bespoke events.
 "When people think about decor, they usually think about flowers or whatever is going on the tables, but I think that the best bang for your buck is to bring in some lighting," Birch said. "Lighting the existing landscaping that you have, whether its trees, grass, or flowers, is a great way to make it feel really special. Even color-changing lights, so that you come in and there's one mood, maybe is very romantic, and as the night goes on, you can be more fun with changing colors, texture and pattern."
 Birch suggests putting down a floor in places like the cocktail area, under the dinner tables, or the aisle -- if there's going to be a formal aisle. "We always recommend floor aspects for an outdoor wedding, they give guests a reprieve from walking on grass," she said. "Grass can hold water for a few days, so if it rained two days before, the yard could become muddy with even 50 people walking on it."
 She also recommends heel protectors that not only protect your guests' heels and your grass, but also prevent people from sinking into the lawn.

Dear Dave,
 I'm having a hard time saving money. Do you have any practical advice for saving when you have an average income?
 Nikki
 Dear Nikki,
 One thing I've learned over the years is that people only start saving money when they learn healthy money habits - like living on a written, monthly budget - and let their future needs become more important than their current wants. What I'm saying here is it will only happen when you make saving a priority.
 Everything doesn't have to magically line up before you start saving, and there are plenty of easy, practical ways to save money and breathe a little extra air into your finances. The biggest one is by saying goodbye to debt. Monthly payments are the biggest drain I can think of when it comes to saving money, because debt robs you of your income.
 Most people are shocked when they realize how much they're actually spending at the grocery store. It's easy to walk through the aisles grabbing things on impulse, but it all adds up. Save money on groceries by planning out your meals each week. Here are some other good ideas:
    Buy generic. One of the easiest ways to save money is to give name brands the boot.   Skip the coffee shop, and make coffee at home.   Take your lunch to work, and eat breakfast and dinner at home.   Cut your ties with cable, and try network apps or streaming services.   Check your insurance rates. You owe it to yourself to have your agent look things over for you, and see what savings they can dig up.   When buying, pay in cash and ask about discounts. You never know until you ask, and you should always ask.   Declutter your home, garage, basement or attic. Get rid of things you don't need and are willing to let go of for the sake of your financial future.   Lower your cell phone bill by getting rid of extras like costly data plans, phone insurance, and useless warranties. Don't be afraid to haggle with your provider, or switch to another company.   If your goal is to save money, a vacation is just about the worst thing you can do. Finding fun close to home will save hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.  
 When it comes to saving, Nikki, how carefully and intentionally you spend can be more important than how much you make!

After some disagreement over terms, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and his Republican challenger Loren Culp have agreed to a televised debate on Oct. 7.
 The debate will be broadcast live from 8 to 9 p.m., immediately following that evening's Vice Presidential debate, according to the Washington State Debate Coalition (WSDC).
 The candidates will participate in the debate from separate rooms at the Olympia headquarters of TVW, the state's C-SPAN-like government affairs channel. It will be broadcast statewide by major TV outlets including KING, KOMO, KIRO, Q13 and KCTS, said Lincoln Vander Veen, a spokesman for the WSDC.
 Culp, the police chief in Republic, Ferry County, had pushed for a debate in which the two men would face off in the same room, but socially distanced. His campaign did not immediately comment on the terms of the debate agreement announced Tuesday.
 Inslee's campaign welcomed the debate terms.
 "We are in an unprecedented moment and to ensure a safe and responsible debate, the WSDC presented this format and our campaign agreed to it," said Inslee campaign spokesman James Singer, in a text message.
 Singer declined to comment on why Inslee resisted appearing in the same room with Culp, but Inslee has criticized his GOP opponent for hosting large rallies across the state in which few participants wear masks or abide by physical distancing guidelines.

Another week, another big trophy for Dustin Johnson, this one without any cash.          One week after he captured the FedEx Cup and its $15 million prize, Johnson was voted PGA Tour player of the year for the second time in the last five years. He also won the Jack Nicklaus Award, which comes with a bronze of Nicklaus famously raising his putter, in 2016.          Johnson joins Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Nick Price and Fred Couples as the only players to win the award multiple times since it began in 1990.          Johnson was on the ballot with Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, PGA champion Collin Morikawa and Webb Simpson. The tour historically does not release the tally of players who voted. It was the second straight year the award went to someone who did not win a major during the season. In this year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was only one major.

PLYMOUTH - Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Amy Naples and Chamber Director of Operations Bob Nolet have pulled another rabbit out of their hats.
 No, the Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce's Waterfront Festival did not happen this summer due to COVID-19.
 But the Chamber is still moving forward with several absolutely free events next week and weekend that should deliver plenty of fun and joy, as well an economic boost. A Cruise Night, POP-UP Artisan Marketplace and Virtual Ducky Dash will help enshrine the Chamber's reputation for unstoppable progress even during a pandemic.
 Sponsored by Tiny & Sons Auto Glass, the Chamber's Cruise Night is set from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 17 at 180 Water St. in Lot 4. Want to show off your ride? Hop online to plymouthchamber.com and enter your car in the show for $12. Naturally, space is limited, so don't hesitate. Visitors will enjoy the free event, admiring the cars, and the Chamber will award best in show at the end of the evening.
 "We though this would be a great activity for families to enjoy and for people to visit the local businesses in the area as well," Naples said.
 The Chamber's Virtual Ducky Dash at 1 p.m. Friday, Sept. 18, should attract kids of all ages who will see just how fast their rubber ducky can "paddle." Ducks are $2 or $6 for 10 and can be purchased at plymouthchamber.com. Visit the Chamber's calendar and click on the Ducky Dash. Competitors will be assigned numbers and tune in to the Chamber's Facebook page to view the Ducky Dash live at Brewster Gardens at 1 p.m.
 Next up, the Plymouth Waterfront POP-UP is set from 3 to 7 p.m. Friday, Sept. 18 and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 19 in Nelson Park, featuring an Artisan Marketplace.
 "It's basically for local artisans to sell their products and wares," Plymouth Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Amy Naples said. "We know that industry has been impacted, so we came up with this idea to generate some revenue."
 The governor's social distancing guidelines will be followed to the letter, Naples said, noting that everyone must wear a mask.
 "We have contact tracing and will have sanitation units throughout," she added. "And we have implemented even more measures to ensure the safety of everyone."
 Many have said they relied on the Plymouth Waterfront Festival in years past to do all their holiday shopping, Naples added. This artisan fair is perfect to do just that. While the festival isn't allowed at the moment, due to the governor's guidelines, this scaled-down fair allows for socially distancing. The Nelson Park parking lot can only hold so many cars, and, with masks, everyone should be safe, Naples said.
 If you and your family want to enjoy the festivities, don't forget to wear a mask; it's required. For more information, visit plymouthchamber.com.

“Our kids have access but it’s very fragile,” said Lillian Maldonado French, superintendent of Mountain View School District in El Monte. “We really are hoping to have a better, more stable solution for our community.”
 Compton Unified School District Supt. Darin Brawley said that while it took time to distribute technology in the spring — partly due to delayed orders — Compton ultimately met their needs. Still, the district now needs about 3,500 devices and 1,500 hot spots.
 “We had hot spots, but the ones we are using were not solving the issue of connectivity,” Brawley said. “Our kids are struggling to find a spot on the property or the house where the device will actually work.”
 And about 20% of the computing devices handed out in the spring were never returned or were damaged, creating significant replacement costs that are likely to be ongoing as long as students work primarily from home, he said.

This is going to be different. Very different.
 There will be fewer games this fall sports season, fewer fans at those games, no sectional or state tournament championships as the carrot on the end of the stick in front of the players as well as more new rules and safety precautions than you can shake that same stick at.
 How things look at the field will be different, too, with everyone taking their own water bottles, limited to, if any, use of the locker rooms as well as social distancing whenever possible on the sidelines.
 This is going to be a very different season, but at least it is actually happening. That's surely going to bring smiles to student-athletes, coaches and athletic directors all across the Patriot League as they get ready to play some games.
 The first day for fall sports practices is Friday, Sept. 18, with games in the condensed regular season schedule starting about 10 days after that.
 Other high schools in Eastern Massachusetts are working with a different situation than what's happening with the Patriot League. The South Shore League has pushed their opening day to Sept. 25, while the South Coast Conference has moved all of their fall sports opportunities to the new Fall II season that will open at the end of February.
 "I think we've got a good plan to go forward with the season," said Hingham High AD Jim Quatromoni, who spent a bunch of time this summer working as a member of the MIAA's COVID-19 safety task force. "We've set down the guidelines for the way we are going to play sports this fall, and we'll all have to make some adjustments to make it work.
 "But the most important thing is we need to give these kids a chance to play sports again in as safe a way as possible."
 Rule changes are numerous in all of the fall sports. But the biggest change was the move of football, cheerleading and unified basketball to the Fall II season, which will begin on Feb. 22 and go until April 25, when the calendar will flip to the regular spring sports season.
 Another big change this year is the official addition of Marshfield into the Patriot League mix. After the Atlantic Coast League was dissolved at the end of the 2018 spring season, Marshfield competed last year as an independent entity but eventually fit in as an adopted member of the Patriot League and filled most of their schedules against those teams.
 Marshfield was officially added to the Patriot League earlier this year and will fit nicely into the Keenan Division with Plymouth North, Silver Lake, Hingham, Duxbury and Whitman-Hanson. The Fisher Division side of the ledger is now filled with Plymouth South, Quincy, North Quincy, Scituate, Pembroke and Hanover.
 The league has unofficially adopted another school this sports season with Notre Dame Academy of Hingham filling in non-league slots on a lot of girls soccer, field hockey and volleyball schedules this fall.
 "It made a lot of sense to invite NDA into our bubble. They come from a small league and a lot of the teams they play are quite a distance away," Quatromoni said. "They were in a bad situation, and I'm glad we were able to help them out."
 NDA-Hingham Athletic Director Kristen McGill-Kelly said the help of the Patriot League "is much appreciated. We were on a little bit of an island with other Catholic Conference schools like Ursuline, Fontbonne and Mt. Alvernia, so not having to travel so far to play games will be good for us."
 "We're absolutely ready to go and looking forward to the season," McGill-Kelly added. "There's lots of things that still need to be worked out in the next couple weeks, but we are grateful for the chance to play."
 There will be some new faces leading the Patriot League programs this year. Justin Domingos picked up his office and moved a couple of exits down Route 3, leaving Pembroke to take over the Plymouth North athletic program. Brian Phillips is now the athletic director at Pembroke High, while Billy Battis has shed the interim from his title and is now the permanent A.D. for Marshfield High.
 "It's been an interesting month, but I'm ready to get the fall season going," said Phillips, who's been on the job for the Titans for about two weeks. "The other ADs in the league have been great about getting me up to speed as quickly as possible as I try to get my feet wet.
 "We're all in the same boat right now as we try to figure out the best way to do this for everyone's safety. The key is staying flexible at all levels for whatever could come at us."
 Domingos said things were "falling together pretty nicely at Plymouth North" where the regular season will begin the last week of this month with a pair of golf matches. "There are still some loose ends that need to be tied up but nothing that will hold us back. The schedules look good and the busing situation is lining up, so that's good.
 "The kids and the coaches are just excited that they'll have the chance to play some games once again."
 Across America's Hometown, things are also coming together at Plymouth South, the defending league champion in football as well as boys cross country.
 "The nice thing for us is we have great athletic facilities at Plymouth South, so everyone will be ready to go on the 18th," said Panther A.D. Scott Fry. "We're all on board. I'm sure there are going to be changes to the way we've done things in the past, but I believe that the student-athletes and the coaches will do anything needed to make this situation work.
 "It's going to be a different season, but we are pleased at the opportunity to even have a season after what happened with the spring athletes. Something is still better than nothing."
 Silver Lake A.D. Martha Jamieson said the fall season will be a "fluid situation" with schools having to turn on a dime if the situation calls for it.
 "You can't really plan way ahead for what we'll see this season, but I think we can still get this done safely for everyone involved. Everyone's health and safety has to be our #1 priority," Jamieson said. "We just have to take one step at a time and meet all of the challenges that will pop up as we get things rolling."
 Jamieson said the Lakers will see some changes for the fall season, one being the movement of the starting line for cross country meets because of space restrictions.
 "The fortunate thing for me as an A.D.," she said, "is that I have a solid, stable and veteran coaching staff to lean on and help everyone get through this."
 Scheduling games in the Patriot League for soccer, volleyball, golf and field hockey follows a pretty easy pattern. Teams will play the other five teams in their league twice and then play one non-division contest to add up to 11 games.
 While there will be no sectional or state tournaments this season, teams will have the Patriot League Cup to play for this season. Teams will be seeded at the end of the regular season and will play at least a couple of games on the way to deciding the winner of the inaugural Cup.
 "The Patriot Cup came from an idea floated by Duxbury High A.D. Thom Holdgate, and everyone jumped right on board to make it happen," Domingos said. "It's a great way to keep everyone involved until the very end of the season."
 "I love the idea of having the Patriot Cup tournament at the end of the season," Quatromoni said. "Not only will it give teams something to shoot for at the end of the schedule, it will also give teams a chance to play even more games."
 "It is a nice way to end the season," said Fry. "It's a pretty creative way to give kids an opportunity to play more games."

“Unintentionally, but absolutely truly, what we have done with the model … started to work in an opposite direction than we wanted,” Marsh said. “For a lot of people, the message was received that you shouldn’t test — that the fewer tests that we take, the less number of positive cases there are and therefore you can improve your color.”          According to Marsh, this is the opposite of what state officials want from a public health standpoint.          “Most people that spread COVID-19 are asymptomatic or presymptomatic, so we really want to increase testing,” Marsh said. “In order to make our communities safer, and better, and improve the public health, we need to really accelerate testing.”          In an attempt to rectify this, Gov. Jim Justice announced counties will be able to use their percentage of positive tests for a rolling seven-day period to determine their color on the county alert system.          “Just because we had a good plan doesn’t mean we can’t make the plan better, and better, and better, and better,” said Gov. Jim Justice, while announcing the changes to the alert system.          Marsh said testing more people, particularly those who do not have symptoms, will help bring that percentage of positive tests down, thereby incentivizing more testing in communities.          Testing allows individuals who are COVID-19-positive to be isolated and contacts who may have been exposed to be quarantined, thereby reducing the risk for transmission of the disease.          It can also provide data to the state that is useful in making determinations on what mitigation measures might be beneficial in a particular community.

Memories dating back to the 70's and 80's when "Land of the Lost" introduced kids to a terrifying race of lizard people called Sleestaks.      “I used to be able to say to my sister ‘The Sleestaks are gonna get you’ and she'd cry,” laughs Marr.      They must have left an impression because Marr has gone through an awful lot of trouble to bring back the Sleestak. He started by carving out a head he hoped to wear with a tuxedo for Halloween.      “Once the head came out and it was looking kind of good I decided well I might as well do a body too,” says Marr. “So I took my credit card and here we are.”

CHARLESTON — Poca football coach Seth Ramsey began burning up the phone lines Tuesday afternoon. He wasn’t alone. He and coaches throughout the region weren’t about to let a golden opportunity slip through their fingers.
 On Tuesday, Gov. Jim Justice and other state officials announced a new color between yellow and orange on the state’s color-coded COVID-19 map: gold. The metrics of that new category gave five counties — Putnam, Fayette, Boone, Logan and Mingo — new life for their fall prep sports seasons.
 Under the gold designation, students can return to in-person learning. They also can compete against other schools within their respective counties or against schools from other gold counties.
 As of Tuesday afternoon, Ramsey had contacted several schools looking for a game this weekend.
 “Anybody that’s gold we’ve been trying to get a hold of,” Ramsey said.
 It was a sudden change for those counties going from orange, where teams couldn’t play games and were allowed only to run conditioning drills, to gold, where teams can actually return to the field. Yet the coaches made sure they weren’t blindsided. Some have been talking to other teams for weeks about possible games if they were ever allowed to play again.
 And when Justice floated the concept of a gold designation during his Monday videoconference, the talks heated up even more, as the counties that thought they could move into gold started planning for that possibility.
 Still, it’s a more involved project than just getting two teams together, Buffalo football coach Brian Batman said. So much more goes into staging a game than just the game itself.
 “It’s not as easy as, ‘Hey, you wanna play? Sure, let’s play,’” he said. “Somebody’s got to get buses. Somebody’s got to get officials.”

Under the agreements, the countries have committed to exchange embassies and ambassadors and to cooperate on a broad array of issues, including education, healthcare, trade and security.
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the day "is a pivot of history. It heralds a new dawn of peace.”
 Neither Netanyahu nor Trump mentioned the Palestinians in their remarks, but both the UAE and Bahraini foreign ministers spoke of the importance of creating a Palestinian state.
 Emirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the brother of Abu Dhabi’s powerful crown prince, even thanked Netanyahu for “halting the annexation” of West Bank land claimed by the Palestinians in exchange for Emirati recognition. Netanyahu, however, has insisted that Israel has only temporarily suspended its plans to annex West Bank settlements.
 “Today, we are already witnessing a change in the heart of the Middle East — a change that will send hope around the world,” al-Nahyan said.
 Bahrani Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani said Bahrain would stand with the Palestinians. “Today is a truly historic occasion,” he said. “A moment for hope and opportunity.”
 But in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian militants fired two rockets into Israel, apparently meant to coincide with the ceremony. The Israeli military said the rockets were fired from Gaza and one was intercepted by air defenses. Earlier in the day, Palestinian activists held small demonstrations in the West Bank and in Gaza, where they trampled and set fire to pictures of Trump, Netanyahu and the leaders of the UAE and Bahrain.
 There are no active wars to be ended by the agreements, but Israel and the U.S. hope they could usher in a major shift in the region should other Arab nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, follow suit. That could have implications for Iran, Syria and Lebanon. Until now, Israel has had peace deals only with Egypt and Jordan.
 Other Arab countries believed to be close to recognizing Israel include Oman, Sudan and Morocco.
 “We are very down the road with about five different countries,” Trump told reporters before the ceremony.

Overall, I think we had, like you said, great energy across the board.

Johnson's assessment is spot on. While hope is certainly useful to the extent it motivates people to action rather than abject surrender -- to vote, to alter how they live and consume resources and to influence their family, friends and neighbors to similar action -- there is no realistic chance at this point that things will, as the saying goes, "all turn out okay."

Addin Fonua-Blake could depart Manly at the end of the season after the Sea Eagles allowed the powerhouse prop to talk to rival NRL clubs.
 Fonua-Blake has told Manly he wants to leave Sydney with his family, despite having two years left to run on his contract.
 Manly confirmed on Wednesday they were open to releasing the 24-year-old, who is set to become one of the most in-demand forwards in the NRL.
 But the Sea Eagles have said they will only release the forward if they receive compensation, likely from his next club.
 "Addin is a senior and highly valued member of the Sea Eagles squad and would be a huge loss," a Manly statement read.
 "(However) out of respect to him and his circumstances the club has today given its permission for the exploratory conversations to be conducted immediately
 "The club will look favourably upon a request to release Addin from the final two years of his contract on compassionate grounds as long as the Sea Eagles receive fair and reasonable compensation.
 "The club has advised Addin and his manager that this matter needs to be resolved promptly so that all parties can confidently plan for the future."
 While the Tongan international landed himself in hot water earlier this year for offensive comments to a referee, he is one of the game's best props.
 He leads all front-rowers for metres per run in the NRL with more than 10, and his one-two combination with Martin Taupau is one of the best in the NRL.
 The Sea Eagles front-row depth would also take a hit, having won just one of five games without him in the past two seasons.

Having last year dropped $2.15 million on a nearly 100-year-old Spanish home in L.A.'s low-key but increasingly expensive Beverly Grove neighborhood, "Moone Boy" star Chris O'Dowd and writer/presenter Dawn O'Porter have none- too-surprisingly put their former home in the nearby Melrose District up for grabs at almost $1.8 million. The showbiz couple, he a 2019 Emmy winner for the short-form British series "State of the Union" and she a best-selling author whose fourth novel ("So Lucky") was published last year, hope to more than double the not-quite-$875,000 they paid for the late 1920s Spanish bungalow a bit more than seven years ago.
