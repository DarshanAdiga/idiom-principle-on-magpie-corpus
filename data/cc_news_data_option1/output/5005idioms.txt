Kentucky: Needing a lift after consecutive thumpings by top-ranked Alabama and No. 6 Florida, the Wildcats quickly imposed their will on the Gamecocks. That built a big cushion and more importantly, they added to it for a change after struggling with complete games. Impressive considering they played without 17 players, including five starters.

“It’ll be transition,” said Malzahn of resettling team goals. “It’ll be the next best, the 6-4. That’s what it’ll be, 6-4, and if you had a normal non- conference schedule it’d be a solid year.
 “But obviously we’re not happy we weren’t able to beat one of those ranked teams. I think we played the No. 1, No. 5 and what was it, No. 2 or 3 on the road earlier, and we weren’t able to win those games.”
 Auburn went 1-3 against ranked teams with an opening win over No. 23 Kentucky, which is currently 3-6, and double-digit losses to No. 4 Georgia, No. 1 Alabama and the Aggies. In those three losses, the Tigers were out-scored 100-39.
 Many of the problems came along the line of scrimmage. In the losses to UGA, UA and TAMU, Auburn was out-gained 658-355 on the ground and allowed nine sacks.
 Quarterback Bo Nix struggled in three of the four of AU losses, which included a 30-22 defeat at South Carolina, completing just 56 percent of his passes and throwing six interceptions with only one touchdown.
 Nix was better against TAMU Saturday, completing 15 of 23 passes for 144 yards and rushing for 49 yards and two touchdowns on 11 carries.
 He gave a long answer when asked about the frustration of being 5-4 .
 “I think from the standpoint of 2020 overall, I think it was frustrating for most teams, to be honest with you,” Nix said. “What we’re used and what we’re accustomed to in the game of football hasn’t been the same this year. It’s been completely different. At one point, we didn’t even know if we were going to have a season. So that was frustrating. Just learning how to go through adversity is just part of the process. It’s not like we have a bad team by any means. We played 10 SEC opponents, and it wasn’t like we were blessed with the opportunity to play the lowest four like some other teams. We battled and we competed the entire season. Teams that maybe we played that we were ranked, they just had good football teams and great experience. Probably our three losses against Georgia, Alabama and A&M – they all had really good teams with playoff hopes when we played them.
 “I mean, you can put a lot of things on a lot of people and say a lot of things about this and that, but at the end of the day, they were just better than we were when we played them. That can go into the offseason, that can go into not having a spring, not having a summer, not developing guys this offseason and sending them home, so this kind of season goes to who has the most experience. We felt all year that, at the beginning, we were going to be the least experienced team, and I think some games it kind of showed. Some games we might could have played a little bit better, it came down to the other team having better experience. For whatever reason, this that and the other, we lost to those teams. So it’s definitely a learning year. All you can do is just move forward, make sure you finish the season how you’d like and not just let the whole season go to waste.”

Insurgents killed 43 hapless Nigerians in cold blood, tied their hands to the back as they slit their throats. The second day, we all went back to our different businesses, as if nothing happened. Like the Dube train passengers. If tears were ever shed, it must have been by the respective family members of the dead. There was no remorse, no solemnity, no sobriety; no regrets. No flying of flags at half masts. No national address by President Muhammadu Buhari; no single personal word from him, except the doggerel from his media captives. No earth-shaking speeches garlanded with national bother. President Buhari did not fly to Zabarmari the second day to empathize with the people. He didn’t shut the gate of the Presidential Villa to visitors, nor did he heap ashes on his face as Jews did in ancient times.

In Nigeria, bodies rot on streets and people go about their businesses unperturbed. Lynching of alleged thieves is a usual sight, like in prehistoric times. Only this weekend, one happened in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo State. During the EndSARS protest, some persons even went a notch higher: They re- evolved into the cannibalism of their ape ancestors by devouring the roasted corpses of their policemen victims. Governments literally lynch and roast their citizens through inhuman policies and they maintain straight faces. We criminalize our heroes and hero-worship our criminals and villains. The Buhari government will go down in history as the author of this perverted and inverted corpus of national ethos. Not only does it deify “repented” Boko Haram insurgents, it “resettles them” with billions of Naira votes and heroes like Adeniyi are criminalized for standing by high ideals. There are no loyalties to high or even low ideals, just base, animalistic instincts. Erstwhile tender mercies have morphed into scavenging and baying for blood of fellow citizens. We are now a dog eat dog society. Respect for laws of the land have transmogrified into disdain and anarchy, from rulers to the ruled. It is so bad that, even if a whole city lapses into ruins today – God forbid – Buhari will go into his characteristic poise of tooth-picking and cross- legging.

While the Tigers defense improved slightly in the second half, it still wasn’t enough to stop the Aggies.
 After the game, safety Jordyn Peters credited Texas A&M for its performance.
 “They're a great team. They came out there, and they executed their plays better than they have, we would say, coming up to any game this year,” Peters said. “They just came in. They were showing us some sets. They were giving us a little bit of trouble, and we found a little bit of trouble trying to fit it the right way throughout the game. Usually after halftime, we come in and we draw it up. I feel like after halftime we had more of a handle on it, but that was a great team. They came out there, and they played well.”
 Defensively, Auburn had opportunities to hold the Aggies, but were ultimately unable to stop them.
 Including one near-interception that instead went through Zakoby McClain’s hands and ended up a Jalen Wydermyer touchdown that put Texas A&M ahead 21-20.
 “Yeah, I mean, you’re playing a really good team. It’s going to come down to just a few plays if you’re going to have a good chance to win,” Malzahn said. “Give the guy credit. We thought we picked it off. We didn’t. It got tipped and he kept his eye on it and he made a touchdown. It went from one extreme to the other. I think it was third down.”
 All season long the Auburn defense has been able to make stops late in the game when its number is called, but it couldn’t hold the Aggies on their final drive.
 Texas A&M finished 7-of-11 on third down attempts, and converted on two crucial third downs on the final drive of the game.
 “Yea, we’ve been pretty good in those must-stop situations this year. When we’re burning our timeouts, we’ve been really good up to this point. But obviously today, we weren’t,” Malzahn said. “You’ve got to give them credit. They made the plays with the game on the line to win. Kind of sums up the day.”

Entonces, en ese caso -y tambien si lo hace con 10, cinco o hasta con dos- es posible que aparezca el 'benching'. La psicologa clinica Josselyn Sevilla lo define como "la practica mediante la cual una persona mantiene conversaciones con otra, a pesar de no estar interesada en ella". El 'Plan B' de toda la vida. El caso es que, aunque ese 'Plan B' haya existido siempre, las nuevas tecnologias multiplican sus posibilidades y, al mismo tiempo, los efectos que puede tener en quien participa, muchas veces sin saberlo, del juego. Sevilla insiste en que es importante no patologizar antes de tiempo los fenomenos que surgen de las redes sociales, pero tambien reconoce que las victimas de 'benching' -esas que creen estar construyendo una relacion con alguien a traves del coqueteo 'online', pero que en realidad solo son un chat mas entre muchos otros- pueden llegar a desarrollar problemas de autoestima, estres e inseguridad.
