After playing baseball at a junior college in Minnesota, I moved on to play at a DII school in West Virginia and then ended up at USF to finish out my college baseball career. At first, I was just looking for any school to play at after leaving West Virginia; shortly after visiting the area and meeting some teammates and coaches, I quickly realized that Sioux Falls was a great place to be, and I was excited and fortunate for the opportunity to move here and play ball.

Koslosky's lawyer declined to comment when asked specifically about this and other allegations from former players and parents.


  Tara Graybill, 37, said soon after she joined the Stellarz at age 11, Koslosky phoned twice weekly and kept her on for hours — even when her parents thought she was asleep — discussing life, religion and dating.


  "I'm 12 or 13 years old and just want to play soccer," Graybill said. "But I figured he could help me be good, so I listened."


  That changed once Carnell joined the team. Graybill by then had a boyfriend and said Carnell became Koslosky's "favorite" while her own playing time was cut and confidence shattered. She partly blames Koslosky "messing with my head" for an eating disorder she later suffered.


  Nancy Overturf, whose daughter played for the Stellarz, said some parents by spring 2000 "noticed the behavior between Amy and Mike just didn't seem right. There were rumors going around that maybe something was going on."


  Overturf said she invited Koslosky to dinner at her home, where she confronted him about the rumors and told him to "knock it off." She said he stormed out. Her daughter's playing time was soon reduced and she quit the team.

Is there anything more satisfying than finding a nutrient-dense, moisturizing conditioner your hair just drinks up? For us dry-haired folk, it’s like finding your soul mate. Strands that were once parched, brittle, and breakage- prone turn into strands that are lush, strong, and full of life.


  And if we do say so ourselves, natural, clean, and organic conditioners tend to have a leg up on the rest of the competition. That’s because these options are filled with plenty of plant-derived actives that are good for hair health in the long term--not just impersonating softness with synthetics.

Cosmetics and toiletries products containing chemicals have been used by people for thousands of years to enhance beauty, maintain hygiene, health, and for other uses. Demand for cosmetics and toiletries products has increased dramatically in the last few years owing to the growing consumer inclination towards using anti-aging and sun-protection formulations to stay young and protect themselves from the harmful effect of UV and environmental pollution. The global cosmetics and personal care industry was valued at approximately US$ 330 billion in 2015. Cosmetics and toiletries products contain a wide range of chemicals for specific functions. Most of these formulations include colorants, hardeners, UV filters, preservatives, antioxidants, emollients, surfactants, emulsifiers, and fragrances. Ingredients of these chemicals could be synthetic or naturally occurring substances. Water used in the cosmetics and toiletries formulations should be ultra-pure and free from toxins, microbes, and other pollutants. Emulsifiers are used to keep oil and water from separating in the mixture. Preservatives are added to chemical formulations to prevent the growth of micro-organisms such as fungi and bacteria and extend their shelf life. Few of the preservatives used in the cosmetics and toiletries products are benzyl alcohol, salicylic acid, parabens, formaldehyde, and tetra-sodium EDTA. Thickening agents are used to give an attractive consistency to the product. There are mainly four types of thickeners i.e. lipid thickener, naturally derived thickener, mineral thickener, and synthetic thickener. Emollient is another chemical ingredient used in the cosmetics and toiletries products to soften the skin while preventing the water loss.

  # 7-year-old dies after being hit by SUV in Woodward-Granger High School parking lot


  Philip Joens


  Des Moines Register


  View Comments


  A 7-year-old boy was struck and killed after running in front of an SUV in the Woodward-Granger High School parking lot Monday, according to the Iowa State Patrol.


  At 3:42 p.m., the boy ran in front of a 2019 GMC Denali, according to the Iowa State Patrol. The 47-year-old driver hit the boy on the passenger's side of the vehicle, according to a crash report. The driver stopped after hitting the child, according to the report.


  Matt Adams, Woodward-Granger Community School District superintendent, said in letter obtained by the Perry News that the district was heartbroken by the death of the student.


  "This death is sure to raise emotions, concerns, and questions for our school district and especially our students," Adams said in the letter. "If there is anything we can do to support your student, please let us know."


  Grief counselors are being made available to students, according to the letter.

And in summer 2000, when Carnell was 16, somebody apparently did sound the alarm. Carnell’s mother, according to the lawsuit, was phoned by a man who said he was from the Washington State Youth Soccer Association and who told her someone suspecting sexual abuse complained Koslosky had driven Carnell to a tournament in California alone and they'd overnighted at a hotel.


  Her skeptical mother confronted the pair, who'd indeed driven alone, but they claimed others carpooled with them and parents jealous of Carnell were starting rumors. Carnell’s mother believed them and says the association — today operating as Washington Youth Soccer (WYS) — never followed up while Koslosky kept coaching and abusing her daughter, according to the lawsuit.


  It was one of numerous red flags allegedly missed or forgotten around the Northwest Nationals and other teams Koslosky coached over two-plus decades through 2002, according to interviews by The Seattle Times with former players, parents and administrators. The allegations also are in Carnell's lawsuit claiming the coach pressured her to go along with the abuse while the soccer groups failed to protect her. Seattle attorney Lindsay Halm filed the suit in King County Superior Court against Koslosky, WYS and Sound FC — which Northwest Nationals became after a 2016 merger with FC Alliance and a 2019 rebranding.


  Since Carnell filed her lawsuit, other former players have come forward, telling The Times about behavior they thought inappropriate by Koslosky since the late 1970s — describing a "touchy-feely" coach who at least three times abruptly left teams under unexplained circumstances. Carnell and others say they're speaking out because today's newer WYS safeguards still won't suffice unless players and parents are better trained to spot potential "grooming" and sexual abuse by coaches.


  "My life may have been totally different had people known what to watch for and not dropped the ball," Carnell said.

From here, the news gets pretty dreary. We’re entering the holiday season and the flu season, and many are contending with celebrating in the absence of friends and loved ones. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says we should only gather outdoors, which is fine if you happen to live in southern climes.


  But what about folks up north, if any are left? Most seem to have migrated to South Carolina, where local Republicans are worried they’ll turn the state from red to blue. Urban apartment life doesn’t lend itself well to even small gatherings during a pandemic. But, then, maybe our trials will make us all more creative — and more mindful of our blessings.


  Given the stakes, it’s difficult to understand why some people prefer to put themselves and others at risk than to take the simplest precautions. We’ve heard the mantra hundreds of times: Wear a mask, avoid large gatherings, socially distance. We’ve also heard that if everyone would play nice (and keep to themselves) for two straight weeks, we’d be able to get the pandemic under control. Two weeks is nothing.


  And, yet, there are those who’d rather follow President Donald Trump’s example of roaming mask-free and cite his rapid recovery from COVID than surrender to what they consider misguided groupthink. This attitude may be Trump’s most diabolical contribution to the United States.


  Being a curious sort, I’ll sometimes ask people why they’re not wearing a mask, a risky proposition in itself. Here in the Bible Belt, many say they’ve put everything in God’s hands. But the gift of free will was predicated upon an assumption of intelligent life. Predictions of ongoing spikes in infections and death rates are based on current trends of idiotic behavior, but it isn’t ordained that we commit stupidity. Besides, the alternative to voluntary acquiescence is far worse. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to encourage mask mandates and order lockdowns if he has the authority.


  I’m no more inclined than the next renegade to fall in line, but what say we buck up and end this thing quickly?


  Otherwise, Democrats may force us to meditate, too.

I was fortunate enough to play a little professional baseball down in the southwestern part of the United States. The team I played on actually won the league championship, and it was a great capstone for my competitive baseball career. I still play amateur baseball here in South Dakota for the Kimball- White Lake Nationals, and we’ve had a great last couple years. I am a serial entrepreneur, and I own a few different businesses currently. One of my main businesses is Platinum Bat Co. LLC, which is headquartered right here in Sioux Falls. The business was started in October of 2017 with a former teammate and friend of mine. We have had great year-over-year growth and expansion. We have players of all levels swinging our bats and using our fielding gloves as well as the other products we offer. It’s been a great way for me to stay in the game.

Shaw, who had to return home from India's last Test tour of Australia in 2018-19, after suffering an ankle injury ahead of the first Test, has yet another chance to play his first Test series in Australia.


  Shaw, 21, made his Test debut in October 2018 and became the youngest Indian batsman to hit a century on debut.


  The right-handed opening bat has played four Tests and three ODIs for India and has scored 335 Test runs at 55.83 with one century and two half-centuries.


  Shaw comes into the tour on the back of a disappointing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 season for Delhi Capitals. He finished the tournament with 228 runs from 13 games at 17.53 with two fifties.
