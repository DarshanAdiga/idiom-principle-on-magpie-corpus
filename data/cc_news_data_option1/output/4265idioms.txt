It is hoped that everyone in Milton who is a resident registered to vote does so. Now more than ever, the multiple ways in which a person can cast a ballot — in person early, by mail-in, dropping off a ballot earlier requested by mail outside the town offices building and the traditional voting in person on election day — make voting more convenient for one’s schedule.
 Decide for yourself what and who you believe is the best option, the best person. Let your conscience be your guide. It is best to do this by your own volition. Trust yourself to make the right or best choice.
 There is another decision to make regarding Milton’s Question 3 concerning the adoption, or not, for a second-try on the statewide Community Preservation Act. An allowable use in the CPA ties into a longstanding issue in Milton: affordable housing.
 One person’s definition of affordable housing is different from another person’s definition of affordable housing. What a 40B proposal cites as affordable may be too expensive; the prices for housing on Craigslist are too high by about $300 to $500 a month for the people looking for housing, based on their wages and pandemic circumstances.
 For a town that focused like other communities across the country this spring and summer on the need for an antiracist society, lack of affordable housing also is a barrier to a better place and way to live for those who seek it. Affordable housing is part of a just society. The stereotypes of who needs affordable housing run the gamut. Not all people who want to live in Milton and whose income is limited may move in with children. People, including children, who need affordable housing, do not want or need to be considered a burden. That’s an awful weight to carry. Or, an awful weight to impose on someone.

News out of the Big Sky Conference was scant until Oct. 15 when Sacramento State, which finished ranked No. 9 nationally last season, announced it was opting out of the spring 2021 football season, citing safety concerns regarding the subsequent turnaround to the regularly scheduled fall 2021 season.
 The next day, Big Sky Commissioner Tom Wistrcill tweeted that the conference committee and athletic directors were working on a six-game schedule of conference-only play for the remaining 12 participating teams.
 Weber State head coach Jay Hill says six games is adequate to balance the two top concerns of safety and budgets.
 "I think it’s perfect. It gives you enough games that we can prove what we're all about and (the Big Sky will) get two teams in the playoffs, at least. It gives you an opportunity to get ready for the playoffs, and I don’t think six games is going to interfere that much with the fall of 2021," Hill said.
 "The more games you go, the more you run the risk of affecting fall 2021 and that’s a big deal. Nobody wants to affect that year."
 Since the NCAA has already granted fall (and now winter) sports athletes an extra year of eligibility regardless of the seasons that are or are not played, players and teams can gear up and make their run, no matter how it looks, and not lose a year of opportunity.
 Hill called that "a great ruling" from the NCAA.
 "Now that they can play without penalty as far as eligibility, why wouldn’t you play? You can practice or you can play, and guys play sports to play games," he said. "We could play six opponents in the spring, or we have three scrimmages plus four or five other live practices in the spring. You might as well just play games."
 Hill said the target start date is Feb. 27 and the model under consideration calls for three weeks of games, an off week, three more weeks of games and another off week prior to the playoffs — with both weeks off providing opportunities to make up games lost to postponement, if needed.
 While it's not the kind of season anybody is used to, Weber State will prepare to win.
 "We still want to have an opportunity to make a run at a national championship from our conference," Hill said.

Третье (то, что сделали мы) — это онлайн- опрос”.
   
 Астапеня отмечает, что пользователи интернета, которых в стране по разным источникам от 75% до 82% от всего населения, являются более экономически и социально активными, чем те, кто интернетом не пользуется. Таким образом, по словам автора опроса, это означает, что реальная поддержка Лукашенко и его политики может быть немного выше, поскольку его сторонники обычно менее социально и экономически активны, чем его противники.

The race for the District 11 seat in the Utah House is a rematch of the contest two years ago.
 Rep. Kelly Miles, a Republican from the South Ogden area, is going for his fourth term, challenged, as in 2018, by Jason Allen, a Democrat from Washington Terrace.
 Miles puts his focus on education, job creation and affordable housing, all with an eye to his kids, grandkids and generations to come.
 “I want to make sure they have the same opportunities I had,” said Miles, an attorney. “I want to make sure there are some jobs available, that we’re attracting some good employers.”
 Allen, a civil engineer, wasn’t sure if he’d try again for the seat, which represents Riverdale, Washington Terrace, Uinta, part of South Ogden and South Weber in neighboring Davis County. Miles won in 2018 by a 55.2%-44.8% margin. Hearing stories of Miles not responding to constituents’ queries, however, prodded him to action. “That really emboldened me,” Allen said.
 Allen also expressed dismay with what he sees as Miles’ lack of representation in the district, underscored, among other things, by his vote late last year for a controversial overhaul of the state’s tax system. Allen, like many, opposed a proposed hike on taxes for groceries and gas in the measure, among the more debated provisions.
 “That’s not representation to me,” Allen said. A tax on groceries, he lamented, would adversely impact lower-income Utahns.
 Miles and the other lawmakers later voted to repeal the overhaul in response to the outcry, which Miles said shows that he is, in fact, responsive. “We did exactly what we’re supposed to do as a republic government,” he said. As for complaints that he’s not responsive to constituents’ queries, Miles noted that lawmakers are part-timers and that he has other obligations — to work, family and church. At any rate, he always tries to respond as quickly as he can.
 Miles said he aims as a lawmaker to address the needs of all. “I believe in compassionate conservatism, that we need to listen to all voices and meet the needs of all of them,” he said.
 More politically, he put a focus on making sure the balance of power is maintained, that government or any particular branch of government doesn’t overstep its bounds. The issue has become particularly important of late in light of things like the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting governmental regulatory efforts meant to guard against its spread.
 “I think these emergencies this year have brought that to the forefront, that we need to focus on that,” Miles said.
 He favors Amendment G, the proposed change to the Utah Constitution on the ballot this cycle that would channel some income tax funds, now earmarked specifically for education, to programming for kids and the disabled. The change, if approved, would “go a long way in helping us with our tax structure.”
 The biggest message sounded by Allen, who describes himself as a “moderate conservative Democrat,” is about paying attention to constituents. Government works best, he maintains, when it reflects the will of the people. He would generally vote according to constituents’ wishes.
 “The big one is listening and constituents and listening versus stewardship. I think representation is a big thing,” he said, vowing to hold town hall meetings and periodically visit city councils throughout District 11 to get input. “I want you to feel I’m listening. I want you to know I’m listening.”
 His driving force as a lawmaker and in general is trying to make the world a better place and inspiring others around him to do the same.
 Allen opposes Amendment G, fearful it would pull funding away from education. Education needs more funding, he said.

Tzouliadis sums up Roosevelt’s assessment of Stalin, “After his return from Tehran [in December of 1943], the president broadcast a fireside chat to the nation: ‘To use an American and somewhat ungrammatical colloquialism, I may say that ‘I got along fine’ with Marshal Stalin. He is a man who combines a tremendous, relentless determination with a stalwart good humor. I believe he is truly representative of the heart and soul of Russia; and I believe that we are going to get along very well with him and the Russian people— very well indeed.’ Nor was this simply a public façade designed to reassure the American public. In her memoirs, Eleanor Roosevelt confided that her husband had been ‘impressed by the strength of Stalin’s personality. On his return he was always careful in describing him to mention that he was short and thick-set and powerful… He also said that his control over the people of his country was unquestionably due to their trust in him and their confidence that he had their good at heart.”

MILAN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Modest Sassuolo, a team that have spent most of their history in the lower and amateur levels of Italian football, will spend at least 72 hours top of Serie A if they can beat Torino on Friday.
 Seen by some as the 'new Atalanta' thanks to their relentless attacking football and habit of surpassing expectations, Sassuolo have scored four goals in each of their last three games and are second with 10 points.
 A win over pointless Torino on Friday would take Roberto De Zerbi's side one point ahead of current leaders AC Milan, who do not play until Monday when they host AS Roma, and with no other team able to catch them over the course of the weekend.
 In other matches, third-placed Atalanta (9 points) are at home to Sampdoria on Saturday while Napoli (8) visit promoted Benevento on Sunday and titleholders Juventus (8) entertain Verona.
 Sassuolo have established a firm foothold since reaching Serie A for the first time in 2013 and are in their eighth consecutive season in the top flight.
 De Zerbi is an admirer of coaches such as Manchester City's Pep Guardiola and Leeds United's Marcelo Bielsa and his team's style of play would be instantly recognisable to followers of those clubs.
 The 41-year-old's belief in keeping the ball runs so deep that he even praised Manuel Locatelli last week after the midfielder gave away possession on the edge of the area and allowed their opponents to score in the 4-3 win over Bologna.
 "We must not be afraid of losing the ball, because that can happen. If we want to play from the back and take the initiative, we will be repaid in the long run," he said.
 Midfielder Filip Djuricic even turned down a chance to move to AC Milan because he felt Sassuolo were a better run-club.
 "Everything works, starting with a serious and organised club who always follow an idea," he said. "It's a type of football that everyone might not understand, but it's the future."
 De Zerbi led Sassuolo to eighth last season and his biggest fear was that the team could be broken up in the transfer window as bigger clubs swooped, but they survived largely intact and are aiming even higher this time.
 "Our best deal was keeping hold of our key players and it wasn't easy because there was a lot of interest," said general manager Giovanni Carnevale. "But these lads wanted to stay with us because they believe in the Sasuolo project."

Those who work locally with domestic violence cases are wary that the coming colder weather, which draws families indoors to spend more time together, will also bring with it increased cases of abuse.
 For many, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought additional stresses, and with back rents coming due and increased restrictions possible as cases of the disease rise, Sue Chandler, the executive director of DOVE (Domestic Violence Ended) in Quincy, is sounding the alarm that things will likely get worse.
 “It’s been a really hard year and I think we’re looking at another really hard stretch in that hard year,” she said.
 October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and details of DOVE's fundraising efforts can be found at DOVE.org.
 The organization's annual fundraiser, A Week of Harvesting Hope, will be held virtually from Oct. 23 to Oct. 30.
 Dawn Hayes, director of marketing and philanthropy for DOVE, said the nonprofit agency serves about 9,000 people each year, half through its education programs and the other half through direct services such as counseling.
 DOVE has seen the numbers of requests for services increase across the board every month since June.
 The services include a 24-hour crisis hotline, an emergency shelter, counseling, legal advocacy, and support groups.
 Chandler said that once COVID restrictions began to ease, her organization “started to see an increase in numbers of people reaching out to DOVE for all of our different services.”
 Chandler said that with the courts also closed, many clients, most of whom are women, are seeing “more desperate situations and are suffering more serious injuries before they are seeking help.”

BERLIN, Oct 22 (Reuters) - A Syrian suspected of killing a tourist in the German city of Dresden early this month had been classified as a radical Islamist and was under observation on the day of the attack, security officials said on Thursday.
 The 20-year-old man had been categorised in 2017 as likely to pose a threat to public safety, said Saxony state's head of police, Petric Kleine.
 Some 600 suspected Islamists are in this category in Germany, according to authorities.
 The Syrian was released from prison, where he had served more than two years for recruiting members to a terrorist organisation, only days before the attack.
 In an assessment months before, authorities had said it was highly likely the man would commit more crimes once released, Kleine added.
 He was under observation on the day of the attack and the two preceding days, said the head of the Saxony branch of the domestic intelligence agency, Dirk- Martin Christian.
 He added that people just released from prison were not normally monitored 24 hours a day, but declined to give more details.
 Investigators accuse the Syrian of attacking two tourists, one aged 53 and the other aged 55, from the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia with a knife. Both were severely injured and the 55-year-old later died.
 The Syrian had come to Germany in October 2015 at the peak of the migrant crisis and was later granted refugee status, police said. He lost this status because of his criminal record in 2019, but could not be deported due to the civil war in his home country. (Reporting by Sabine Siebold; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)
