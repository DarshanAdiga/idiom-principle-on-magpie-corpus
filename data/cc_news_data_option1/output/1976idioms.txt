 RALEIGH -- Kevin Keatts has filled the assistant coaching vacancy on the North Carolina State men's basketball team with Mike Summey, a former manager for the Wolfpack and most recently an assistant at Bowling Green.
 N.C. State announced his hiring Tuesday, along with the additions of Steve Snell and Chris Zupko to the basketball operations staff.
 Summey replaces the departed Takayo Siddle, a trusted Keatts lieutenant, who left the Wolfpack in March to take the UNC Wilmington head coaching job. Siddle spent the last six seasons working as an assistant for Keatts, first with UNCW (2014-17) and then N.C. State (since 2017).
 Summey comes on board after five seasons at Bowling Green. A native of Hickory, he was an N.C. State student manager as a senior in college -- former Wolfpack coach Herb Sendek's first year in charge -- before gaining the role of graduate manager for N.C. State from 1997-99.
 He has made other assistant coaching stops at St. Francis (Pa.), North Florida, The Citadel and Division II program Queens. He served as Miami's director of basketball operations under coach Jim Larranaga for four years, and also spent one season as the head coach at Bethany, a Division III program in West Virginia.
 Bowling Green went 43-22 across the last two seasons, with Summey's help providing a piece of the puzzle during the Falcons' best back-to-back stretch in more than 70 years. Bowling Green reached the Mid-American Conference Tournament final in the 2018-19 season, and was the second seed in the league tournament this past season before the coronavirus outbreak canceled the event.
 Snell becomes N.C. State's director of basketball operations. He owns more than 30 years of experience on the Division I level. He spent last season as an assistant coach at Ohio, and has had assistant coaching gigs with Denver, Santa Clara, Air Force, Louisiana-Monroe, Tulane, Marshall, East Tennessee State and UNC Greensboro, among others.
 Zupko joins N.C. State in an assistant director of basketball operations capacity. He had been Drexel's coordinator of basketball operations for the last four seasons, after 10 years with the Hoop Group organization. Prior to that, Zupko worked as a Hargrave Military Academy assistant coach for six seasons. Keatts was Hargrave's coach during four of those seasons.

Warum man überhaupt eine Änderung bei der Buslinie vornehmen will, verstehe ich zwar weiterhin nicht. Aber wir sind sehr froh, dass man es jetzt doch geschafft hat, den Fahrplan bis 2021 zu verlängern“, freut sich Maria Stefler, die Obfrau des Elternvereins der Volksschule St. Georgen am Sandhof, die sich mit ihren Sorgen an die „Krone“ sowie Klagenfurts Vizechef Wolfgang Germ wandte.
 Auch wenn die Situation im nächsten Jahr den Eltern weiterhin Sorgen bereitet. „Denn dann müssten die Kinder von der Schule bis zur stark frequentierten Josef-Sablatnig-Straße gehen, die mehr als unzumutbar für die Kleinen ist“, ärgert sich Stefler. Gemeinsam mit anderen Eltern suchen sie nach Lösungen: „Der 50-Sitzer könnte beim Rüsthaus, das sich neben der Volksschule befindet, stehen bleiben. Die Gefahr, dass etwas passiert, wäre viel geringer.“

It's been a while since Jeev Milkha Singh arrived at a golf course with bated anticipation. The previous instance was the final day of the 2012 Scottish Open when he arrived at the Castle Stuart Golf Links in Inverness five shots behind the lead. The thrill of catching up with Francesco Molinari and going past in a playoff rivalled the "kid in the candy store" feeling on Wednesday when he left his sprawling Sector 8 house in Chandigarh for the Chandigarh Golf Club (CGC)."Emerging from lockdown and the golf course reopening after two months, it was as if I wanted to make the most of every moment," said Singh.The four-time winner on the European Tour called it "day One of liberation"."Getting back on the course which has made you has to be respected," said Singh.He had to go through the protocols that reflect the new reality--he wore a mask, his temperature was checked, and his golf cart was sanitized with bleach--before Singh could enter the club.Unlike the Delhi Golf Club, which also reopened on Wednesday and has allowed caddies in protective gear and a severely limited role, the CGC has barred them till further notice as quite a few of the caddies reside in containment zones. With no men on the bag, Singh and his three playing partners arrived at 10.45am and hit the range 15 minutes later to strike balls after choosing bays that ensured social distancing. Tee-off was at 11.30am with the four taking turns to drive the cart, as per the new norm, and the rest reaching the ball's landing area on foot. Reaching out for the rake to smoothen the bunker is also a thing of the past as a player now has to manually level the sand with his shoe after completing a bunker shot.Amid regular sanitisation of hands and clubs every few holes, Singh and his partners finished nine holes a little earlier than the normal two-and-half hours as tee times have been kept at a 15-minute gap.A novelty on the greens had Singh gushing. With players forbidden to touch the flag or put their hands into the cup to extricate the ball, the CGC has installed discs on the flag staff about three feet from the ground. After finishing a putt, all a player needs to do is to lift the disc with the putter to get the ball out.Two-time European Tour winner Shubhankar Sharma also hit the course with playing partners Karandeep Kochhar and Rohan Kathuria."This is the longest I have been away from golf since I started playing. "I can't explain the excitement we have for being together at the course after a long time. It was tough to stay away but now that we are back, it will help us get into the groove for tournaments," said Sharma. It was more enjoyment than counting scores, but when Kochhar, a winner on the domestic tour, beat his fancied rival Sharma, there were fist pumps followed by virtual high fives from where they stood on the green.Maintaining distance on the course was like "walking on egg shells" for Shiv Kapur, who teed off at DGC. "There is a fear of doing anything wrong," he said. Playing nine holes at the Lodhi Course under similar rules as the ones at CGC, Kapur felt the social angle, especially during practice, had reduced. "Like it or not, it's pretty much get on and off the course with people no more sitting around (over food and drinks) chatting before and after a round. There's a sense of eeriness as if one is playing an altogether new sport."From a professional's perspective, the changes may become routine after a while but the role of caddies and playing with masks on may have to be reconsidered when competitive golf resumes.Singh was tempted to remove the mask, especially during tee-off, as it hampered both his vision and his breathing. Kapur did take the mask off when he had to play a shot because the elastic bands hurt his ears; he kept the mask on between shots."I don't see masks being put to use in tournaments at least while taking a shot. As for caddies, it will be interesting to see their role as we work as a team," said Kapur.One regular at the CGC was missing. Singh's father, the legendary sprinter Milkha Singh is 90, and according to the new restrictions, only players below the age of 65 are allowed on the course."Because of his age, he is little bit scared to come out in this scenario," Singh said. "I was also given instructions to remain safe, sanitize time to time and maintain social distancing, as I have old parents and a young kid at home. We will get used to playing in this scenario, with restrictions."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen will be released from federal prison Thursday and is expected to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Cohen has been serving a federal prison sentence at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. He will be released on furlough with the expectation that he will transition to home confinement to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, the person said. Cohen, 53, began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak, arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars. Attorney General William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons in March and April to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. Otisville is not one of those facilities. Cohen was told last month he would be released to serve the rest of his three-year sentence at home in response to concerns about coronavirus. He had told associates he was expecting to be released earlier this month. The Bureau of Prisons has placed him on furlough as it continues to process a move to home confinement, the person familiar with the matter said. The agency has the authority to release inmates...

The LPGA has decided to cancel Tour qualifying "Q-schools" this year because of the coronavirus pandemic with most players retaining their status for the 2021 season, the elite women's golf circuit said on Wednesday.
 The tour also canceled another tournament because of the health crisis when it scrubbed the Meijer LPGA Classic in Michigan from the schedule.
 The tour, which was suspended in late February after the Australian Open, plans to return on July 23 with the opening round of the Marathon Classic in Sylvania, Ohio.
 Commissioner Mike Whan said the decision to retain the same playing roster, with a few exceptions for players returning from medical exemptions or earning cards from tournament wins, was simply a matter of fairness.
 "We really felt that the right thing to do was make sure that while COVID-19 is going to affect 2020 for everybody, it shouldn't affect your career," he said.
 "And you shouldn't find yourself back trying to play your way onto a tour when you probably didn't get a chance to play your way on or off a tour in the first place."
 There will be no qualifying for any of the remaining 20 tournaments this year, with the fields to be decided the week before the event.
 The Meijer LPGA Classic had already been postponed from June to Oct. 1-4 and will be replaced in the amended schedule by the ShopRite LPGA Classic in New Jersey, which was originally slated for May 29-31.

Harvick, who was right behind Elliott when Busch attempted to maneuver his way behind him, saw it as a miscalculation on Busch’s part as well.
 “You know you just wanted to get back in line so quick,” he said. “Kyle was on the bottom and you’ve got a hole between myself and Chase and I’m sure he had one eye on the mirror and glanced forward and it looked to me like he just completely misjudged it and got the (No.) 9.”
 Elliott was not injured, but was understandably upset. He got out of his car and stayed on the track long enough to raise his middle finger to Busch as he came back around.
 Elliott's crew chief Alan Gustafson – who was Busch’s crew chief at one time – had a heated conversation with his former teammate following the race.
 “They’re upset,” Busch said following the meeting. “They’re mad. I’m not just gonna fix it and we’re gonna sit and have ice cream tomorrow. Obviously they’re gonna have to dwell on it, and the repercussions of it I’m sure I’m gonna have later on down the road.”
 Even so, Busch intends to make contact with Elliott, who he’s always had a good relationship with, he said.
 “I’m certainly going to reach out,” he said. “Him and I have always had a cordial relationship over the years. Certainly we’re not near as close – we’re not friends like you’d say him and (Ryan) Blaney are or anything like that, but I’ve known him since he was 12, 13 years old and been racing with him ever since then in Late Models and Super Late Models, trucks and Xfinity and all that sort of stuff.”

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - Certain parts of the state were gaining attention as possible hot spots for COVID-19 as cases appear to spike and hospital ICU units ran out of beds.State health officials say the apparent spike in cases is likely related to increased on-going testing and contact tracing.As of Wednesday night, Mobile, Jefferson and Montgomery counties had the highest number of COVID-19 cases.“As we expand our testing criteria, we’re going to see more positives,” State Health Officer Dr. Karen Landers said.Dr. Landers said although those counties had the highest number of cases at the time this article was written, it did not mean people who lived in other places were in the clear.“Person’s don’t need to say my county is going down so I’m okay or my county is going up what am I going to do? But look at this statewide as we need to keep our guard up about this virus,” warned Landers.Landers also explained the possible reason Montgomery county hospitals were nearly running out of ICU beds and sending severe COVID-19 patients to Birmingham.She said with more elective surgeries happening that could be contributing to resources spreading thin. She also said hospitals have what is called a “surge” plan, in case they become overwhelmed, which maps out what area hospitals can take their overflow of cases.“As you opened up more you were going to see more demand on your beds but with COVID-19 contributing to that obviously it is of concern,” Landers said.With state hospital ICU units filling up, Landers warned it’s important the community continues to take this virus seriously and do your part by wearing a mask and social distancing to keep the virus from spreading and overwhelming the healthcare system.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

 And while she admitted that she sees a lot of negativity online, she also noted that there's just as much positivity.
 "I think we tend to focus on the negative," she said, adding that the negative comments do tend to stand out to her more. "I just want to respond to those people sometimes even more than the positive ones, which isn't always fair."
 Just last month, Kardashian admitted that she's started not to take offense when people speculate if she's pregnant. She received those comments after sharing a photo of herself wearing underwear and an orange button-up dress that showed off her stomach.
 "So many of the comments were like, 'Are you pregnant? Baby No. 4?'" Kardashian \-- who is mother to sons Mason, 10, and Reign, 5, and daughter Penelope, 7 -- said during an Instagram Live with her friend and Poosh COO Sarah Howard. "I could've taken that offensively… but I knew that I didn't look pregnant."
 "I know what my body looks like when I'm pregnant. I've been pregnant three times," she added. "It's very feminine to have curves and I embrace my body, so I didn't take it offensively… Instead, I wrote back, 'Oh, let's put the good blessings out there.' Like, put out a good vibe."

_Teen who’s raised thousands to help others awarded scholarship_
  _•_
 Boy Scout Fletcher Horne gets a lot of attention these days. Some people, after hearing or watching his interviews, can’t believe he’s 15, said Linda Gavin of South Central Regional Medical Center. He recently fell into local fame after making hundreds of meal deliveries to health-care workers as his Eagle Scout project, simultaneously helping local restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic.
 The articulate son of SCRMC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Mark Horne thought things were business as usual when he was called to South Central Place for follow-up interviews with media. A smile lit his face when he learned he’d been fooled.
 Mississippi State Treasurer David McRae handed Fletcher Horne a giant check for $529 for him to save for college. Fletcher will receive the scholarship in the form of the treasury’s Mississippi Affordable College Savings account.
 “I am thrilled to award Fletcher Horne with this week’s ‘Tell Me Something Good’ scholarship,” McRae said. “Our judges were blown away by the actions this young man has taken amid this crisis, finding a way to thank our health- care heroes while also supporting local restaurants that are struggling during this time. It’s a remarkable project that I am honored to recognize.”
 Granted, college is still a few years away, but the money will be there when he’s ready. The MACS scholarship is an investment program that extends to all accredited colleges and universities. It helps with things like initial living expenses.
 Fletcher Horne, who took media questions in his usual well-spoken way, said he didn’t even know he was nominated for the scholarship, so walking into South Central Place that morning was a surprise.
 “The first thing I saw was a big check,” he said. “My brother and sister have gone to Ole Miss. I might go there. … I have no clue yet (what my major will be).”
 The Laurel Christian School student said his project started when his dad came home after delivering breakfast to Emergency Department staff.
 “My mom and I got to thinking, and we wanted to do it as a widespread project,” he said. “In the first 24 hours, we’d doubled our original goal of $5,000 (on GoFundMe). Now we’re sitting at $9,000.”
 Fletcher and fellow scouts pick up the food and make their deliveries on weekends, working around no-contact rules for health-care workers.
 “We’ve fed urgent cares, the entire hospital staff — we’ve done more than 1,000 meals so far, so we’ve fed lots and lots of people,” he said. “It makes me feel great that we have a hospital staff who are willing to work as hard as they can in times that are very uncomfortable and unusual.”
 Since the state began the MACS program, it’s received hundreds of submissions and applications, from kids donating masks to delivering pet food. It makes McRae feel “proud of the state.”
 “Fletcher’s community service of delivering meals to health-care workers and first-responders is impressive,” he said. “Not only does it help them, it helps local businesses. They need help as well, with employees and staying in business. It really resonated with our panel of judges.”

DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) — Denny Hamlin won NASCAR's first Wednesday race since 1984 when rain stopped the event with 20 laps remaining at Darlington Raceway. The Daytona 500 winner was out front but out of fresh tires and trying to hang on when he got unintended help from Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch. The reigning Cup champion caused Chase Elliott to crash eight laps earlier to bring out the caution. A furious Elliott waited for Busch on the apron of the track and flipped Busch the middle finger as he passed. As NASCAR cleaned the track, it started to rain and the cars were called to pit road under red-flag. It was an already active evening at “The Track Too Tough To Tame” as drivers were racing against the field and the weather. As the drivers sat in their cars waiting for NASCAR to pull the plug, a handful of Elliott's crew members sat on the pit wall staring down Busch. One of Busch's crew members sat between them on the wall and NASCAR eventually ordered everyone back over the wall. Eight minutes later, the race was called and Busch was greeted by Alan Gustafson, Elliott's crew chief and Busch's former crew chief when he drove for Hendrick Motorsports, for a conversation between two masked competitors. Busch immediately copped to the error. “There's no question I made a mistake and just misjudged the gap,” Busch said. “They’re upset, they’re mad. I’m not just going to fix and we’re going to go have ice cream tomorrow. They’re going to dwell on it and I’m sure there are repercussions of it I’m going to have down the road.” Meanwhile, a fox was scampering across the deserted track and Hamlin, wearing a mask that depicted his actual smile, was having a muted celebration in the rain. He walked to victory lane under a large black...

Harvey was one of the few community leaders who were supportive of the gay teachers’ organizing from the outset. The other gay leaders, so to speak, were kind of Dianne Feinstein-allied establishment people. They would say to me, “Don’t be too gay.

MADISONVILLE, Ky. (WFIE) - Community leaders say the city is still planning to construct a new sports complex, but the COVID-19 pandemic may slow down the building process.Madisonville Mayor Kevin Cotton said this progress includes being able to get their survey on the property done, as well as getting engineering studies finished. Cotton says the delay is due to COVID-19 changing the way on how these processes work.“We’ll have to watch kind of how we’re moving forward, but we are still going to be moving forward," Cotton said. "It’s something that we know that this community wants, so we want to make sure that we can provide that for them.”Cotton says that officials are working on securing the property. He also told 14 News that challenges will exist when it comes to funding as they move forward Meanwhile, Cotton says the more work that officials can get now, the better off they will be in the long run. This work includes getting the ground ready and preliminary drawings done.Copyright 2020 WFIE. All rights reserved.

Most people in their advance age, especially among those who are infected by the novel coronavirus and are suffering from some underlying disease such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and obesity, have lower rates of survival, even if they are put on ventilators, a study said.The Washington Post cited the study, published in the Lancet, on Tuesday, saying that most elderly Covid-19 patients put on ventilators at two New York hospitals did not survive."We had no idea how horrific this would be," Max O'Donnell, the senior author of the study and a pulmonologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, was quoted by the Post."Definitely not just the flu," he added.The research focused on 257 critically ill adults, representing a little under one-quarter of the confirmed coronavirus patients admitted at the two hospitals in northern Manhattan between March 2 and April 1. The median age of critically ill patients was 62 years, and two-thirds of them were male.Of the critically ill patients studied, 39 per cent had died by April 28, and 37 per cent remained hospitalised at Milstein and Allen hospitals.No critically ill patients under the age of 30 died at the two hospitals, O'Donnell said, and only a small number of them had to be put on ventilators. But more than 80 per cent of people over 80 who went on a ventilator did not survive, he said.That fact, he said, should be shared with elderly patients and their family members when trying to decide whether to use the invasive procedure to treat severe illness associated with covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus."It's a difficult conversation, obviously," O'Donnell said further.In the second finding, the study also said that discharge and mortality rates for the most critically ill patients have varied widely among hospital systems.Doctors told the Post that mortality rates -- which range from 50 per cent to 97 per cent in published studies -- probably reflect different regions' demographics and the varied treatment practices in the early days of the outbreak when doctors were writing and rewriting treatment protocols on the fly almost every day."The mortality rate [for patients on ventilators] creeps up to 70 per cent when you're over the age of 70," Thomas McGinn, deputy physician in chief at Northwell Health, said Tuesday, told the Lancet."If your mom's 85 and not well, they should know what the potential is for surviving before they have a ventilator placed," he added.The study further appeared to confirm associations between a patient's risk of death and markers for inflammation and coagulation in laboratory analyses of their blood samples. Doctors have been reporting in recent months that some covid-19 patients are suffering from clots that can lead to strokes or respiratory arrest.The obesity rate is among the striking features of the new research. Among critically ill patients under the age of 50 who were admitted to the hospitals, 71 per cent were obese.Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, said the Lancet study "gives a perspective on the devastating nature" of covid-19, and "should give pause to anyone who wants to dismiss SARS-CoV-2 as less than a major threat to health."Covid cases globally surpassed 5 million on Wednesday, with Latin America overtaking the United States and Europe in the past week to report the largest portion of new daily cases globally.Latin America accounted for around a third of the 91,000 cases reported earlier this week. Europe and the United States each accounted for just over 20 per cent, representing a new phase in the virus' spread, which initially peaked in China in February, before large- scale outbreaks followed in Europe and the United States.A large number of those new cases came from Brazil, which recently surpassed Germany, France and the United Kingdom to report the third-largest novel virus outbreak, behind the United States and Russia, across the globe.

There is growing turbulence in the political atmosphere in China. With the "Big Two" -- as the plenary meetings of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the National People's Congress (NPC) are known -- scheduled for May 21 and 22 respectively, opposition to Chinese President Xi Jinping is visibly increasing. The CPPCC and NPC plenums, held in Beijing each March but delayed this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will have almost 7,000 deputies and officials from across the country gathered to discuss and approve laws, the national budget anticipating the economic situation for the coming year, and the national defence and security budgets. Xi Jinping's opponents appear to perceive this as an opportunity to widen the ambit of criticism and gather the assembled deputies' support.Criticism of Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sparked when Xi Jinping, in March 2018, abolished the term-limits for top posts, allowing him and others chosen by him to continue beyond the accepted retirement age. A large number of serving and retired party members and cadres who suffered during the violent cultural revolution decade, apprehending a return to the "one-man rule" of Mao Zedong, are opposed to it. Other factors too contributed to the spread of dissatisfaction with the regime. Mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and the death of Doctor Li Wenliang, punished for making public the news of the coronavirus, provoked a surge in public discontent and criticism. Add to that the instances of apparent subtle protest by some publications of provincial party organisations.Criticisms centred mainly on the Party controlling everything; incrementally stringent and intrusive security controls; the pervasive Social Credit Management system which evaluates the loyalty and trustworthiness of each individual to allow or withhold benefits; expanding the Party's surveillance; imposition of the Party ideology on educational institutions; undue centralisation of the authority; and discarding of Deng Xiaoping's policy of "lie low, bide your time". The perception that the "China Dream" was slipping out of the leadership's grasp was also growing because of the protest movements in Hong Kong, the re- election of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan, and tensions in the South China Sea. A number of Party cadres, academics and officials in Chinese think-tanks privately blame Xi Jinping's aggressive foreign policy for China's growing international isolation and rapidly deteriorating relations with the United States (US).The unemployed, whose number went up from around 20 million in 2019 to an estimated 70-80 million by March this year, and complaints by ex-People's Liberation Army (PLA) personnel, added to the widening discontent. This has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic's impact on China's economy. Despite Chinese President Xi Jinping's exhortations to cadres since early February to resume production, the economic revival has been slow. Discouraged by government policies and the expansion of State-owned Enterprises (SoEs) into all sectors of the economy, prominent Chinese businessmen have publicly voiced complaints and, in late March, delivered a letter to Xi Jinping seeking reforms. These included a call for the return to Deng Xiaoping's policy of "lie low, bide your time". Prominent Chinese economists have stated that unless the US and European economies start picking up, China cannot expect its economy to revive. Amid this -- and almost without precedent in communist China -- people blamed the CCP and Xi Jinping. Many senior Party cadres, officials, intellectuals, academics, students and others have risked punishment to criticise Xi Jinping on their social media. Intellectuals and Professors such as Xu Zhongrun, Xu Zhiyong, Zhang Xuezhong and Yu Linqi have demanded on WeChat that Xi Jinping step down. These posts have gone viral. A major indication of a serious inner- Party discontent was seen in a March 22 WeChat report when "princelings", the children of high-level veteran Party cadres, called for an "Emergency Enlarged Meeting of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP's) Politburo" to discuss Xi Jinping's replacement.A May 5 essay in PLA Daily described the bleak economic and political situation as having reached a "high explosive point", which foreign powers could use to provoke social upheaval. Concerned at the evolving situation, Xi Jinping established a new high-level "Small Group", with nine of his loyalists as members to "prevent and crack down on activities that endanger the political security of the country." He came down hard on Hong Kong, increased pressure on Taiwan, and enhanced China's presence in the South China Sea.Xi Jinping is mentally tough and, as a "princeling", has strong connections to the Party veterans. His trusted loyalists occupy crucial powerful positions. He is unlikely to back-off quietly in the face of inner- Party opposition. The new "Small Group" is a clear warning to opponents, "princelings" and Party veterans to fall in line. But whether they do so depends on the extent of the opposition in the middle and higher echelons of the Party and its veterans.Jayadeva Ranade is a former additional secretary, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India.
