My heart because I already have a heart condition brought on by a virus. I had viral meningitis in 2011 and, a cardiologist surmised, my body sent fluid to my organs to protect them. The sac of fluid near my heart never reabsorbed, so I live with a pericardial effusion that has neither shrunk nor grown in the past 9 years.

Months before, in May, the cruise ship carrying him and several other Mauritians passed just 50 miles from his island nation, nearly close enough for Sungaralingum to see home from his window. The country's supreme court denied his emergency request to dock, and he remained at sea for three more months.


  Gan Sungaralingum's phone screen shows the location of the Island Princess as it passes within 50 miles of his homeland of Mauritius and the capitol Port Louis May 25, 2020. Mauritius was locked down due to the pandemic and would not let any ships into port to let the crew members come home. Gan was stuck at sea for three more months after passing his homeland. Gan Sungaralingum Gan Sungaralingum


  The uncertainty as to when -- or if -- he would make it home caused his hair to fall out as he battled depression, he said.


  Other long-trapped crew members said they too felt traumatized and wonder whether they should return to work at sea.


  "After this experience, I doubt it," a Celebrity Cruises crew member from the Dominican Republic recently told the Miami Herald, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation from the company. "It was a traumatic experience being on the ship for so long, locked in a cabin and not knowing when you would leave the ship."


  For others, the decision is more complicated. With the virus still surging in many parts of the world, unemployment remains high, and cruise ships, once they're operating again, offer a rare chance at a stable job.


  An engineer for Royal Caribbean who was stuck at sea without pay for nearly a month is scheduled to return to work on a ship before the end of the year, but he hopes he can find a land-based job in his home country before then. He fears getting stuck away from his wife and young child without a paycheck again. He requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from the company.


  Cruise ship workers gather on the deck of the Sky Princess to display a large sign that reads 'We will be back' days after the cruising industry came to a halt March 12, 2020. Gan Sungaralingum, a watch salesman onboard Sky Princess, spent 170 days stuck at sea, trying to get back home to the island of Mauritius, during a global pandemic. Sungaralingum began a contract onboard Sky Princess in January 2020, prior to the pandemic. Once the pandemic struck and the border to his island home closed, he found himself stuck at sea, without a paycheck or a promise of a return date home. Gan Sungaralingum Erico Iguchi


  "I'm doing all the best to find any opening position in my country to not return back," he said. "As last chance I have to go back on Royal Caribbean to maintain my family economically well."


  Companies have canceled U.S. cruises until at least Jan. 1 as they prepare to revamp their ships and protocols to better protect passengers and crew from the virus. The CDC lifted its cruise ban this month but put in its place a slew of new requirements companies will have to meet before they can welcome passengers again.


  Some of those requirements are targeted specifically at crew. Cruise companies must test crew members for COVID-19 using PCR tests weekly and report the results to the CDC. The agency's requirements put in place over the summer to help companies better manage crew outbreaks will remain in effect, including mask mandates and individual cabins.


  One Royal Caribbean crew member from South Africa told the Herald he is encouraged by the new CDC rules. He's eager to get back to work because he misses traveling but said he told the company he is not comfortable returning before mid-2021. He won't return unless crew are in individual cabins and are able to get off the ships in ports, he told the Herald.


  "I would like to know from front-to-back what to expect," he said. "For mental well-being it's crucial. Last thing is to crack up and be stranded in a way all over again."

Sungaralingum spent 170 days stuck at sea, trying to get back home to the island of Mauritius, during a global pandemic. Sungaralingum began a contract onboard Sky Princess in January 2020, selling watches in one of the stores onboard, prior to the pandemic. Once the pandemic struck and the border to his island home closed, he found himself stuck at sea, without a paycheck or a promise of a return date home. Gan Sungaralingum Gan Sungaralingum


  Hugo Bray, 46, a shore excursion manager for Princess Cruises, said he is confident that with the proper training, crew members can stay safe from the virus. Crew members already receive training about preventing another common disease, norovirus, from spreading on board, he said, and in his experience, that training has been effective. Norovirus is not deadly for most people.


  But the prospect of limited passenger capacity, something cruise companies have pledged to do, has him worried about his wages. If there are fewer passengers taking shore excursions, that will affect his commission.


  "It's more work for less money -- not an attractive situation," he said.


  The crew repatriation crisis underscored the vulnerability of the industry's workforce. In one of the worst situations, Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line forced crew to continue working on board its ships without pay for five months. Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings stopped paying non-working crew and charged them for basic necessities like soap, snacks and sometimes WiFi.


  The seafarers have little recourse. U.S. labor laws do not apply to cruise ship workers as the companies and ships are registered abroad. The International Labor Organization, an arm of the United Nations, recommended that cruise companies pay crew members at least sick wages during the COVID-19 pandemic, whether the crew are quarantined on land or on a ship.


  Gan Sungaralingum is reunited with his father, Gassen and mother, Sheela, after he spent 170 days stuck at sea on three different Princess Cruises ships, trying to get back home to the island of Mauritius, during a global pandemic. Sungaralingum started his journey as a watch salesman onboard Sky Priness in January 2020, but once the pandemic struck and the border to his homeland closed he was stuck at sea for nearly six months Gan Sungaralingum Gan Sungaralingum


  The United Nations' Maritime Labor Convention of 2006, the only labor protections in place for seafarers, says "the maximum duration of service periods on board following which a seafarer is entitled to repatriation [should be] less than 12 months." Ninety-seven countries have ratified the MLC to enforce its crew welfare rules. The United States is not one of them.


  While stuck on board, Sungaralingum became an advocate for crew members by petitioning governments to allow ships to dock and giving interviews to local radio stations about his experience. He hopes the COVID-19 pandemic will change how the industry and governments treat crew members.


  "Every human is human, whether it's a passenger or a crew member," he said. "The crew have paid a heavy price."

Trump continues to hold a grudge against those he claims undercut his election by pointing to Russian interference efforts, and has suggested it is fair game to not recognize Biden as the President-elect, even though Clinton conceded on election night in 2016 and the Trump transition was able to begin immediately.
 Trump is also continuing to process the emotional scars of losing to a candidate he repeatedly said during the campaign was an unworthy opponent whose win would amount to humiliation.
 "The most important thing we need to keep in mind is that Donald is in a unique position for him," said Mary Trump, the President's niece who wrote a damning account of his family life. "He's never in his life been in a situation that he can't get out of either through using somebody else's money, using connections, using power.

Russia’s old spacewalking compartment will be removed and junked next year to make room for the research lab Nauka — Russian for “science.” Several Russian- directed spacewalks will be required to deal with all this. The plan calls for attaching a cargo ship to the old Pirs module in order to guide it to a fiery reentry.
 The new 22-ton lab — stretching 43 feet (13 meters) long — is so big that it will be launched from Kazakhstan by a powerful Proton rocket. Once at the orbiting outpost, it will double as an air lock and docking port.
 The science lab’s launch — nearly a decade late because of a long string of repairs — is targeted for sometime early next year.

Zeta laid out five areas it plans to focus its efforts as it gets up and running, and chief among them are consumer incentives for EV purchases. Today, federal tax credits can offset up to $7,500 of an electric car's sticker price, but it varies by battery pack size and phases out for automakers after they sell a certain number of vehicles. General Motors and Tesla reached their limits months ago. Second are regulations for emissions, which in turn would spur EV adoption rates and create the need for charging infrastructure, the group's third focus. Zeta also calls for greater federal cooperation to research EV technology and its associated supply chain.
 Finally, there's manufacturing. The group said it's determined to make EVs a shot in the arm for US manufacturing jobs. Not only is there the possibility to assemble the actual cars, but Zeta said it will call on the government to support jobs across the supply chain and for critical materials needed to build batteries.
 The end game is simple for Zeta, though it won't be simple to achieve. By 2030, it wants every vehicle sector to move to electric vehicles, including heavy-duty vehicles. A tall order for sure, and it isn't likely the internal- combustion engine will go silently into the night.

If the Kia Telluride is any harbinger, the 2021 Kia Sorento should be a hit with its new rugged looks. It's a handsome thing, that's for sure. But looks aren't the final decider when it comes to buying a new car; more often than not, it's the price tag. On Wednesday, Kia revealed how much the new Sorento will cost: from $30,560 after a $1,170 destination charge. Adding all-wheel drive to the vehicle increases the final price by $1,800 before other options.
 You may say yikes to that starting price because it reveals a $2,400 increase from the outgoing SUV, but there's a method to the madness. Unlike today's Sorento, the new model drops the current Sorento L trim, which serves as a $26,990 base version. Instead, the Sorento LX is the new entry-level vehicle, which has the $30,560 price tag. Compared to the 2020 Sorento LX, there's really only a price increase of $1,300. And the 2021 Sorento packs way more into the car this time around, which on paper justifies the increase. We'll have to get some seat time to see if it's worth the money in the end, but the SUV looks promising -- especially the interior.
