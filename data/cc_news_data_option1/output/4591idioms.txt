Finding a spare $100 million in a budget proposal that was already $12 million short complicated things for the city council, especially when vital services remained underfunded and the council needed JumpStart funds to stop budget cuts and provide COVID-19 relief. The $100 million community investment needed to be reimagined. Select Budget Committee Chair Teresa Mosqueda outlined some of the programs that will receive money from reshuffling Durkan's $100 million plan. Durkan acknowledged and accepted the change on Monday. In a statement, she described the council's amendments as a continuation of her "historic" plan but "through slightly different community- led processes."

If you go on social media, a lot of the talk is about getting young people into leadership and where they can make and impact change. There is an active movement for a more sustainable change. In a way, the protests were a first step in demanding for accountability and change. For a long time we were just voting between the devil and the deep blue sea.”

O'Brien explained to the friend she did not take him to hospital because "they will start asking questions".


  Later examination found blood spatters on the wall by Keigan's high chair, not from the time he was fatally injured, and on Currie's clothes, the prosecution said.


  O'Brien was cleared of murdering Keigan, after a trial at Sheffield Crown Court lasting nearly five weeks.


  Currie was found guilty of murder and child cruelty.


  The jury delivered its verdicts after deliberating for nearly 13 hours.


  The defendants did not sit in the dock together but heard the verdicts separately.


  They will be sentenced at a later date.


  Jill Brookes, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "Tragically, little Keigan O'Brien's life came to an end only four days after his second birthday.


  "He was killed in his own home - the place where he should have been safest from harm.

On the back of these results--and with genomic and transcriptomic analyses in hand--the research team focused on the genes involved in the signalling pathways that are important for cellular interactions. Dr Carolina Bernal, a postdoctoral fellow and co-first author of the study, identified the VSIG1 gene and she and Dr Silvano nailed it as critical of the restrictive interaction between non-metastatic and metastatic tumour cells. "By expressing it in a tumour cell, metastases are reduced in vivo and in vitro. If it's removed, we find an increase in metastases," concludes Dr Silvano. Metastatic cells in primary tumours can be pinpointed with spiked-scRNAseq, and essential genes and active drugs identified to develop new and effective treatments for colon and other cancers.
