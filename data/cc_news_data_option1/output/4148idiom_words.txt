Earlier this week, arts venues across the country found out whether or not they'd been successful in their application for a Culture Recovery Fund grant.


  The government grants, overseen by Arts Council England, ranged from £50k up to £1m and will help many theatres, galleries and other cultural venues to weather the coming months.


  Shortly after the announcements were made, social media was flooded with messages of thanks directed to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) and Arts Council England.


  But while the grants will act as a lifeline for venues, it has since emerged that the social media thank you messages were a requirement to receive the funds.


  Arts Council England has said that no money would have been withheld if companies were unable to post on social media, but instructions issued to successful grant winners said 'in receiving this funding, you are agreeing to acknowledge this funding publicly'.
