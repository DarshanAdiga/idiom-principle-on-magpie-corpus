Back in the day, the drill for a crappie fishing trip went something like this: Pull up to a tree with limbs above the water, secure the boat, drop minnows down through the limbs, and either catch crappie or spend 30 minutes trying and then move on to the next likely spot.
 Those days are long gone for Lake Fork guide Seth Vanover and other anglers savvy in the use of their Livescope, the latest innovation for seeing what’s below the surface of the water.
 This past week, my friend Phil Zimmerman and I joined Seth and his son, Evan, for a few hours of catching crappie in a manner that, just a few years ago, most fishermen would have thought magic.

“The basics of crappie fishing, such as water depth, structure to fish, etc., have not changed. I still focus on seasonal patterns, fishing shallow during the spawn and following the fish out to deeper structure with the onset of summer. What has changed is how I actually locate them. I’m fishing the same type structures as I did years ago, at the same times of year, but now with the use of my Livescope, I can actually see below the surface of the water; I can actually see individual fish and drop my baits right on the nose of the fish I am targeting,” Seth said.
 Seth studied a waypoint he had marked on GPS, and as the boat approached the submerged brush pile, he began studying the screen of the Livescope.
 “This brush is literally covered up with crappie, look at those two big ones hanging just about that limb that is 16 feet deep and 7 feet out from the nose of the boat. Let’s see if one of these gals might be hungry.”
 Watching the screen, we could see Seth’s one-eight ounce blue and white jig falling vertically toward the fish. Keeping close eye on the jig and the targeted fish on the screen, he paused the jig a foot above the two big crappie and then dropped it down right in front of the nose of one of them.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials on Thursday released some of their long-delayed guidance that schools, businesses and other organizations can use as states reopen from coronavirus shutdowns.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted six one-page “decision tool” documents that use traffic signs and other graphics to tell organizations what they should consider before reopening.The tools are for schools, workplaces, camps, childcare centers, mass transit systems, and bars and restaurants. The CDC originally also authored a document for churches and other religious facilities, but that wasn't posted Thursday. The agency declined to say why.Early versions of the documents included detailed information for churches wanting to restart in-person services, with suggestions including maintaining distance between parishioners and limiting the size of gatherings. The faith- related guidance was taken out after the White House raised concerns about the recommended restrictions, according to government emails obtained by the AP and a person inside the agency who didn’t have permission to talk with reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity.On Thursday, a Trump administration official also speaking on condition of anonymity said there were concerns about the propriety of the government making specific dictates to places of worship.The CDC drafted the guidance more than a month ago and it was initially shelved by the Trump administration, The Associated Press reported last week.The agency also had prepared even more extensive guidance — about 57 pages of it — that has not been posted.That longer document, which the AP obtained, would give different organizations specifics about how to reopen while still limiting spread of the virus, including by spacing workers or students 6 feet apart and closing break rooms and cafeterias to limit gatherings. Many of the suggestions already appear on federal websites but they haven't been presented as reopening advice.Some health experts and politicians have been pushing for the CDC to release as much guidance as possible to help businesses and organizations decide how to proceed.“They want to be able to tell their own employees the guidance of the federal government," Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, said at a congressional hearing Wednesday. "They want to be able to tell their customers, ‘We’ve done everything that’s been asked of us.’”The guidance relates to another document released by the Trump administration on April 17. That phased-in reopening plan broadly outlines how to move away from stay-at-home orders, school closures and other measures designed to stop the spread of the new coronavirus that has caused more than 1.3 million reported U.S. illnesses and more than 80,000 deaths.U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Wednesday offered a resolution — blocked by Republicans — to encourage release of all the documents.“America needs and must have the candid guidance of our best scientists unfiltered, unedited, uncensored by president Trump or his political minions. The CDC report on reopening the country is an important piece of that guidance,” Schumer said.The decision tools have been undergoing review by different federal officials, and they've been edited from earlier versions.For example, an earlier draft of the one-page document on camps obtained by the AP asked organizers if their program would limit attendance to people who live nearby. If the answer was no, the camp was advised not to reopen. That local attendance limitation was dropped and was not in the version posted Thursday.And in that document and others, language has been dropped that asked if the organization is in a community that is still requiring significant disease mitigation. If the answer was yes, the organization was advised not to reopen.___AP reporters Mary Clare Jalonick and Zeke Miller in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.

General Motors Co's self-driving car unit Cruise told staff on Thursday it has decided to lay off workers, the latest start-up in the nascent industry to cut jobs during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Cruise officials acknowledged they were cutting jobs, but declined to confirm the number. According to an internal email partially read to Reuters, about 8% of the staff would be cut, which amounts to more than 140 people.
 The outbreak has caused funding to dry up in the autonomous driving industry. That is only the latest challenge in a sector whose promise of large-scale rollouts of so-called robotaxis has been pushed out by many years.
 "In this time of great change, we're fortunate to have a crystal clear mission and billions in the bank. The actions we took today reflect us doubling down on our engineering work and engineering talent," Cruise spokesperson Milin Mehta told Reuters.
 The cuts at Cruise, which had 1,800 full-time employees, come just a week after GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the No. 1 U.S. automaker's commitment to Cruise was "unwavering" and it was growing the business.
 "Cruise is well capitalized," she told analysts on a May 6 conference call after GM posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit. "We have and will continue to grow our team by recruiting and retaining the very best engineering and leadership talent."
 The email said layoffs at Cruise include staff at an engineering team in Pasadena, California, that works on Lidar, a sensor technology that uses pulsed laser light to sense objects, similar to the way radar uses radio waves. The email was sent by Cruise CEO Dan Ammann on Thursday.
 Lidar start-ups had mushroomed when self-driving car tech drew billions of dollars in investments.
 The cuts at Cruise echo pain felt elsewhere in the industry.
 Starsky Robotics, a five-year-old San Francisco start-up focused on automating long-haul freight delivery, closed its doors in mid-March due to lack of funding. And Zoox, a self-driving tech firm based in Silicon Valley, also has laid off staff during the pandemic.

TORONTO -- Ontario will allow some retail stores as well as vehicle dealerships and construction sites to reopen next Tuesday, its premier said on Thursday, as Canada's most-populous province takes steps to restart its economy after a two-month shutdown.
 Only retailers with a street-front entrance can reopen, officials said, with indoor malls to remain closed. Some leisure activities and horse racing will also be allowed as of Tuesday, although guidelines for social distancing and sanitation remain in place.
 Golf courses and marinas will reopen on Saturday, and some leisure activities - including tennis and gymnastics - can resume on Tuesday, the officials added.
 Ontario, which is Canada's economic engine, has proposed a three-stage reopening, with each phase lasting two to four weeks, according to the government plan.
 "We have to see a (downward) trend for a couple of weeks, so there's no time frame on Stage 2," Premier Doug Ford said.
 Ontario reported an increase of 258 cases and 33 deaths on Thursday, the lowest since late March, according to provincial data. The province's long- term care homes have been particularly hit by the pandemic.
 Overall, Canada's coronavirus death toll edged up by 2.5% to 5,337 from Wednesday, one of the smallest daily increases.
 Ontario is advising retailers to install barriers around checkout counters, provide sanitation for customers and staff, and control the number of people in a store at one time, while construction sites should stagger shifts and be transparent about how sites are sanitized.
 "We have a long way to go and a long road to recovery, but let's take some time to be grateful for how far we all have come," Ford said.
 Ontario shut down most of its economy in mid-March.
 Provinces across Canada are slowly reopening their economies. British Columbia and Alberta, Canada's westernmost provinces, are allowing retailers, restaurants and hair stylists to open their doors over the next week, under strict social-distancing guidelines.
 The premier of Quebec, which has been Canada's coronavirus epicenter, with 60% of the country's deaths, said a planned reopening of the province on May 25 could only take place if case numbers continue to fall.

ST. JOHNSBURY — The History & Heritage Center needs a little work, and thanks to a couple of grant sources there’s a lot of funding to help pay for it.
 The 1772 Foundation, based in Providence, R.I., working with the Preservation Trust of Vermont, awarded $10,000 to the town’s history center. This is in addition to another grant from USDA worth $50,000 that the center already received. The grants require the center to kick in a near-equal amount. In the case of the 1772 grant, a matching $10,000, and with the USDA grant, the center must contribute $42,000, said History & Heritage Director Peggy Pearl.
 The center is seeking contributions to help it meet its matching requirements.
 Grant money from the 1772 Foundation will be used to repaint the main building and repair the front doors. The money through the USDA will pay for the replacement of the north roof and window repairs.
 Pearl acknowledged that the combined $102,000 is a lot of money for the needed building repairs, but said staying true to the historic nature of the Summer Street building comes with a greater cost. “You can’t go the cheap way,” she said. “You have to be in keeping with the history of the house and that gets expensive.”
 The History & Heritage Center was built as a family home by John A. Stevens in 1853. Even though there have been a number of additions and alterations over the past 167 years, the building retains significant historical value. The double doors, which feature arched-top, frosted and etched glass windows, have probably never been repaired. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984.
 The History & Heritage Center purchased the property in 2014. Several rooms showcase artifacts from the town’s history. Special exhibits are created to highlight certain important events or contributing people, businesses and organizations. A barn is filled with large pieces of the town’s history to include a carriage, wagon and large Fairbanks platform scale.
 A new exhibit dedicated to the contributions of aptly-named carpenter Horace Carpenter is in the works. Many of his 19th Century molding planes will be on display. Carpenter’s skills were put to use in the building of South Church and Pinehurst (now the Elks Club on Western Avenue).
 Pearl said the center also intends to display political memorabilia to coincide with the election season. Another exhibit will highlight the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote.
 Seeing the many items at the Center (421 Summer St.) is not possible at the moment, and Pearl doesn’t know when that will change. Restrictions related COVID-19 means the center is closed.
 She said the exhibits will go forward as the center waits for restrictions to loosen enough for public access to them. “Those will go forward and will stay up as long as they need to and be there for people to see them,” she said.
 Pearl is concerned about the potential loss of summertime fundraising events that would help pay for the building repairs. Among the plans is a St. Johnsbury Band concert on the grounds of the center scheduled near July Fourth. The annual Ghost Walk at the Mt. Pleasant Cemetery in August is an important fundraiser. In late September a Festival of Traditional Crafts happens at the center. All of these events are in jeopardy along with the exposure to the center and the donations that are given by event attendees.
 “I don’t see it being a normal summer,” said Pearl.
 More information about the center can be found online at http://stjhistory.org, including details about membership and how to make a donation.
 Pearl said she expects the roof work to begin soon and the painting to happen in late summer.

My friend and I had similar experiences Wednesday morning. Cruising along the back-country road I live on, there was a squirrel in front of me sitting on the yellow line. We were a second or two apart, and the critter decided in the moment, “hey, I can totally make it across the road in front of this big metal monster that’s 1,000 times my size and is barreling right towards me.”
 I still don’t know if he made it. It was around the bend of a curve, so I didn’t see the aftermath, whether he darted up a nearby oak tree or is flat on the asphalt a lá Wile E. Coyote.
 I attended the University of North Texas, where there is in residence, due to a recessive gene in the local squirrel population, an albino squirrel in every generation. A result of which, besides semi-celebrity status — T-shirts, a Facebook page and everything — all of the squirrels on campus have no aversion to humans. They will straight up steal a pizza slice from your table — while you watch.

As a single mom I worked as a maid, a cook and a waitress. I often worked multiple jobs at a time just to make ends meet.
   
 It was only when I became a teacher that I received paid sick days, holidays and precious health insurance. It was luxurious.
   
 With that experience, I have a glimmer of the choice some workers may face today: to work and risk their life or have no money.
   
 It's also clear that the devastation to our economy is unsustainable. It'll be a delicate balancing act to reopen the economy yet save lives.
   
 President Donald Trump and some GOP leaders favor tipping the scales to support business over life. But one side doesn't have to outweigh the other.
   
 Other countries like South Korea have proven that a national system of rapid testing, contact tracing and isolation contains the virus. Two months ago they had the same number of COVID-19 deaths as the U.S. Today we have over 80,000 deaths and South Korea has fewer than 300.
   
 New virus models predict a sharp rise in new cases and deaths due to increased mobility. Health experts worry we're not ready to reopen and cases could spiral out of control.
   
 We desperately need Trump to fully invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to develop a national testing system similar to South Korea's and produce personal protective equipment (PPE) for all essential workers.
   
 The DPA was created to pressure industry into producing supplies for the national defense. When Trump was asked why he doesn't fully invoke it he said, "We're a country not based on nationalizing our business." In other words, corporations lobbied against it.
   
 Although Trump won't use his power to ramp up testing and life-saving PPE, he did sign an executive order forcing meat processing plants to remain open with no protection for workers.
   
 Some GOP leaders have taken the old "pro-business" party to a grim level as they blame the workers, not the companies, for these plants becoming petri dishes for the virus. They conveniently overlook the fact that workers are made to stand shoulder to shoulder.
   
 These and other workers may be called "essential" but they are being treated as if they are "expendable." That's exactly the messaging coming from Trump and trickling down throughout the GOP.
   
 Trump calls workers "warriors," but what he means is they're "cannon fodder." Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie personified that attitude when he was asked about the projection that nearly 3,000 people could die daily by June 1. Christie said our country has "sacrificed" before.
   
 And I'm sure a slew of boots were hurled at televisions when Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick suggested throwing grandparents under the bus to save the economy.
   
 GOP messaging isn't complete without right-wing talkers like Glenn Beck who said he'd "rather die than kill the country." And disgraced, ousted Fox News host Bill O'Reilly chimed in about the death toll saying many were "on their last legs anyway."
   
 Leaders who are sending others into battle should put some skin in the game. I suggest those who feel so strongly about putting the economy above lives should send a loved one to work in a meat processing plant under the current safety conditions. Your sacrifice will be appreciated.
   
 According to a recent PBS News Hour poll, a majority of adults say they are still uncomfortable reopening the country.
   
 You can open up stores during a pandemic, but you can't make people come in until they feel it's safe. Containing the virus is the only way to bring the economy and humanity back.

“Set pieces will be able to be constructed on site, and moved directly to the stage without weather issues or stairs to navigate,” said the press release. “The cast, crew and musicians can also move from the front doors to the backstage area and then right onto the stage all on one level and with no stairs, a blessing for those with mobility issues.”
 With a slight delay earlier this spring as building supplies from China did not arrive on time, Jeanne Woods, the restoration chairperson for LTOB, said the team is hoping to make its deadline and have the fourth phase completed by September.
 “Phase four has been in the works for about a year and a half,” said Woods. “Right now, they are working on putting up a retaining wall and then they’ll start building the foundation. It’s exciting.”
 The theatre contracted construction services from Scott Partney Construction, of North Bend, to build the addition, said Woods. The project cost for phase four is approximately $500,000.
 The project was funded using donations from community members, fundraising events and grants from a number of local and state agencies. According to its press release, the theatre has raised more than $1.9 million toward its restoration project.

Peaceful Nelson, Nevada, offers visitors a step back in time to the vibrant mining days of Nevada, the Silver State, an escape from daily life.   This ghost town is off the beaten path, and while standing among its historic buildings one would not think they were just a 45-minute drive from the bright lights of Las Vegas. Those traveling from Vegas on Route 95 will also pass Eldorado Canyon and "the monument," Nevada Historical Marker 9.      After an enjoyable ride through the valley travelers will come upon several original buildings from the 1700s. Originally, Nelson was called Eldorado, named by the Spaniards. They were the first to find gold in the mountains. About 100 years later the miners and prospectors developed the Techatticup Mine, which stands today in Nelson. The mine has a clouded reputation of killings that resulted from labor and management disputes. However, in 1861 the mine was considered to be the most important in the canyon as it produced millions of dollars of gold ore. The mine, a short distance from the Colorado River, was served by steamboats. The name Techatticup came from two Paiute words meaning "hungry" and "bread."      This now ghost of a town produced millions of dollars of copper, silver and gold until the mine closed in 1945.      Today mine tours are offered by stopping at the General Store in Nelson to sign up for the Eldorado Canyon Mine Tours. The buildings offer a historic tour of collectables from the area. Canoe and kayak rentals are available for those wanting to take an adventure on the beautiful Colorado River.      Inside the General Store is a small museum with pictures and information on the filming that takes place at Nelson, along with memorabilia and historic information. All ages will enjoy exploring the museum and walking around outside finding old cars, trucks and airplanes. The planes were used as props for the movie "3,000 Miles to Graceland." This ghost town is a popular area for use in movie backdrops, photo shoots and music videos. The National Geographic Channel's "Brain Games" was filmed in Nelson, as were the movies "Eye of the Beholder" and "Breakdown."      Do not get your hopes up when you travel downhill and see the Texaco sign standing tall among the historic buildings of Nelson. It is also historic. There is not a gas station or place to eat here. However, the General Store offers snacks and drinks. Fill your tank before setting out to visit Nelson.      Once you have completed the exploration of Nelson, continue to the end of the road where a spectacular view of the Colorado River awaits. Pack a picnic and find a rock, bring chairs, or sit in the car and enjoy what nature has to offer. Visitors can walk down to the river from this area.      Coming back uphill from the river, continue past the general store and on the left will be a few houses and a dirt road, Main Street. Turn left and follow it for a desert drive. If it is raining or has recently rained, better go back the way you came. If you are short on gas or time, do not do it! However, if you do continue, it is a climb to the top where big eared jackrabbits might be seen. Keep your camera ready as road runners are fast but you might get a picture, and the burros are much slower -- they will pose longer.      The road will take desert adventurers back down to Highway 95. A left turn goes into Searchlight, another mining town which, in its heyday around 1902 was more populated than Las Vegas. Today about 500 residents call this town home.      A few buildings are left from the mining days. Searchlight has modern structures, too -- gas stations, places to get a drink and some food, including McDonalds. Las Vegas is one hour from Searchlight and 30 minutes from Laughlin.

MY VIEW: On Memorial Day do the right thing

It was a whole new experience to watch a fish actually strike a bait below the surface via the screen, rather than watch the rod tip. The big crappie, probably weighing 2 pounds, grabbed the bait and was jerking the rod tip down, all it occurred faster than my mind could comprehend. The entire event was crystal clear, in real time on the screen. Seth, who has witnessed this occurrence thousands of times, popped the rod tip up and was hooked solidly to a fish he had targeted on sonar.
 During the course of the morning, this scenario played out many times and I won’t kid you, It took me a fish or two to get my brain and hook set working together, if this makes any sense.
 After I learned how to put the bait right in front of the fish’s nose, I became totally absorbed in what was occurring on the screen, forgetting I held in my hands the key to actually catching the fish — the rod. Rather than waiting for that twitch on the rod when the fish actually struck the jig, I made the mistake of attempting to make the hook set the instance I saw the fish moving to my bait. Seth, who has introduced many to just how lethal the Livescope is in catching crappie, said this is a common mistake with folks learning the new technology.
 “The screen will tell you when the fish is making a move on the bait and when it actually picks it up. When you see this, forget the screen and become tuned in to what you feel on the rod. The bite usually occurs at mach speed, when a fish actually grabs your bait, and if you don’t pull back the instant he pulls down, you probably won’t catch it.”
 A sensitive rod that will tell the sometimes subtle bite of a crappie is a must. We were using two rods of two different lengths, both Wally Marshall Pro Series. The 12-foot model worked best when precisely dropping the bait to a particular fish being targeted and the 5-foot model for casting. The added length of the 12 footer made it much easier to maneuver the jig so that it would fall vertically, which helps to avoid hang ups. The shorter rod was used when we were pitching jigs to fish a bit farther out but still visible on the Livescope’s screen.
 Yes, technology has taken catching fish to a whole new level. I remember years ago using an old iron window weight and a rope marked with electrical tape in 1-foot increments to determine depth and then the flasher units, paper graphs, LCD graphs, etc. When each of the new advancements in sonar came out, I thought, “It just can’t get any better than this.” Well, with the Livescope, it just got better, a whole lot better. What could possibly be better than actually watching a fish take your bait below the water’s surface. Give the engineers a couple more years, we will see!

This reminds me of the movie “Over the Hedge,” a digitally animated cartoon movie that follows a bunch of woodland creatures who wake up from hibernation to find their patch of wilderness has been bulldozed around them to create suburbia. A savvy raccoon, RJ, voiced by Bruce Willis, shows them how to adapt to their new neighbors. One of the characters, voiced by Steve Carrell, named Hammy, is an ADHD squirrel. In one memorable scene, Hammy drinks an energy drink that basically slows down time for him, turning him into a super squirrel who can dance between sprinkler drops and save the day.
 This also reminds me of the movie “Up,” where all the dogs are distracted by the word “squirrel,” but that doesn’t quite fit with what my column’s about, unless you’re looking for family-friendly movie suggestions.
 I get it. We humans are basically pushing through their territory, their natural habitat, but squirrels are just their own brand of special. They follow Murphy’s Law, and the only reason they are still around is because they breed like rodents, cute rodents, but still. According to Smith College, the Eastern gray squirrel can breed up to twice a year with litters numbering from one to eight.
 Fun fact, a group of squirrels is, appropriately, called a “scurry.”
 So, stay safe on the roads, and if you see a squirrel on the side of the road, don’t be surprised if he goes for the extreme option.

Yes. A property tax exemption for up to five years exists for new, expanded or acquired manufacturing facilities. Last year, nearly 200 manufacturers in 53 counties qualified for $161.2 million in exemptions, according to a tax commission report. The tax code requires manufacturers to maintain or exceed the base payroll amount established for the calendar year its assets were placed in service. During what has been called the Great Recession of 2008, the commission disqualified a manufacturer from the property exemption for failing to meet the payroll requirements, ruling that “ameliorating factors … due to the current economic crisis are equitable in nature and are not grounds for waiver of the payroll requirements …”

Over the past few years, Zoe Tucker — a member of the Chisum Lady Mustangs basketball team — established herself as one of the most dominant post players in the Red River Valley. Now, she’s ready to put her skills to the test at the next level, after officially signing with the Roosevelt University Lakers on Wednesday.
 Tucker began playing basketball at a young age, first taking an interest in the sport when she was six years old. It didn’t take long for her to take an immediate liking to it.
 “I really liked the intensity and competitiveness of it,” Tucker said. “I’ve always been one of the biggest and toughest girls, so being down low and working hard in the post is what excited me the most.”

PARIS/WASHINGTON -- France said on Thursday that the world's nations would have equal access to any novel coronavirus vaccine developed by pharmaceuticals giant Sanofi , a day after the CEO suggested that Americans would likely be the first in line.
 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in an interview, said he hoped that any vaccine developed would be shared worldwide.
 "I hope that we will all collectively find a way to produce this at high volume to get it all across the world and make sure that every citizen that needs access to a vaccine can get it as quickly as possible," the top U.S. diplomat told Israel's Kan 11 News during a trip there.
 Scientists are rushing to find treatments and vaccines for a disease that has killed nearly 300,000 people worldwide, including more than 84,000 in the United States. Even as nations grapple with the ongoing pandemic, experts are weighing the impact any potential vaccine may have on a disease that has already laid bare the world's inequities and power struggles.
 "A vaccine against COVID-19 should be a public good for the world," French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Thursday, adding that "equal access of all" was "non-negotiable."
 He was speaking after Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson told Bloomberg News on Wednesday: "The U.S. government has the right to the largest preorder because it's invested in taking the risk." He apologized on Thursday, saying it was vital that any coronavirus vaccine reach all regions.
 Hudson's comments had upset President Emmanuel Macron, an Elysee official said.
 Sanofi, which has urged stronger European coordination in the hunt for a vaccine and has U.S. financial support, clarified that any such vaccine would be made available to all.
 World leaders in April pledged to accelerate their work on COVID-19, the disease caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus, but the United States did not participate.
 The United States also ignored a pledge last week by world leaders and organizations to spend $8 billion to manufacture and distribute a possible vaccine and treatments.
 More than 90 vaccines are currently being developed globally, with eight in the clinical trial phase. But experts say the process could take years and may not happen at all.
 There is still no vaccine for HIV, which emerged in the early 1980s, or SARS, a coronavirus that hit Asia in 2002.
 U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday reiterated that he believed there would be a vaccine by the end of the year, in contrast to the top U.S. infectious disease expert, and said that he was already working on plans to distribute it.
 "I think we're going to have a vaccine by the end of the year and I think distribution will take place almost simultaneously because we've geared up the military," he told reporters at the White House, adding that more details were expected on Friday.
 He also said there would be a U.S. announcement regarding the World Health Organization as soon as next week but gave no other details. The World Health Assembly, the WHO's decision making body, meets May 18 and 19.
 Trump, who faces re-election in November after winning in 2016 on an "America First" agenda, has urged a quick re-opening of the U.S. economy despite the lack of approved treatment, vaccine or widespread testing.
 Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, on Tuesday said a vaccine would not likely be available by the autumn but that he was cautiously optimistic there would eventually be one.
 "It's definitely not a long shot," Fauci told a U.S. Senate panel, adding that a vaccine was "more likely than not … because this is a virus that induces an immune response and people recover."
 'A FAIR AND EQUITABLE PLAN'
 More than 4.39 million people have been reported to be infected globally and 296,847 have died, according to a Reuters tally. The United States has the highest death toll at 84,256.
 Sanofi is working on two vaccines projects, one with British rival GlaxoSmithKline Plc that has received financial support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the U.S. Health Department and another with U.S. company Translate Bio that will use different technology.
 A U.S. whistleblower who was removed last month as the director of BARDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agency responsible for developing drugs to fight the coronavirus, told the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday that he was concerned about U.S. coronavirus preparedness, including vaccination efforts.
 "There's no one company that can produce enough for our country or for the world. It's going to be limited supplies. We need to have a strategy and plan in place now to make sure that we can not only fill that vaccine, make it, distribute it, but administer in a fair and equitable plan," Richard Bright said.
 The WHO is leading the global initiative to develop a vaccine, and its spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a briefing in Geneva that while some treatments in very early studies seem to help "we do not have anything that can kill or stop the virus."
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which approves medicines for the European Union, said on Thursday a vaccine could be approved in about a year in an "optimistic" scenario.
 "For vaccines, since the development has to start from scratch … we might look from an optimistic side in a year from now, so beginning of 2021," the EMA's head of vaccines, Marco Cavaleri, said in Amsterdam.
 But the EU, some of whose members have been among the hardest hard hit by the pandemic, fears it may not have sufficient supplies, especially if a vaccine were developed in the United States or China. Its executive branch, the European Commission, is weighing using a $2.6 billion emergency fund to boost pharmaceutical labs' capacity.
 Trump on Thursday said he had signed an executive order to expand U.S. domestic production of certain strategic resources relevant to the outbreak, but he gave no other details.

At Chisum, Tucker excelled on the court, and she shone on both sides of the ball. Defensively she was a stopgap, snatching up rebounds at an astonishing clip and making it a challenge for any opposing player to score in the paint.
 “I think I’m a defensive-minded player,” Tucker said. “I try to bring it on defense every single game. Defense wins games and it triggers the offense. Also, if I’m having an off-night on offense and not hitting my shots it doesn’t matter as much if they’re not hitting their shots.”
 Offensively, she possesses a soft touch around the rim and uses her size to get quite a few points off putbacks after offensive rebounds.
 Tucker improved each year, and it all culminated in a senior campaign in which she was one of only two girls in the area to average a double-double for the season. Tucker’s capabilities were on full display, and she averaged 10 points and just under 11 rebounds per game.
 And as good as she is on the court, Lady Mustangs head coach Will Smith said Tucker’s greatest strength is only seen behind the scenes.

The trajectory the ruling Jubilee Party is taking is detrimental to the evolution of a democratic society.
 Increasingly, the party is becoming exceedingly dictatorial and patronising. Early in the week, the party’s top leadership sacked two Senate officials — Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen and Chief Whip Susan Kihika — ostensibly on account of gross disrespect for President Uhuru Kenyatta, the party leader.
 In quick succession, it has followed that up with a threat to expel five nominated senators who skipped the State House meeting. Indications are that worse things are on the cards, which is terrifying.
 Expelling members from a party is retrogressive and despotic, a relic of past oppressive regimes. Precisely, it is a sad reminder of the dark days of Kanu, which in its heyday established a disciplinary committee chaired by the late Okiki Amayo that turned into a monster.
 The committee terrorised, humiliated and expelled party members, particularly Cabinet ministers and MPs, for real and imagined crimes, including speaking independently in Parliament in a manner perceived to be critical of the administration.
 Indeed, the discontent that the committee elicited compelled President Daniel arap Moi to disband it. That history is important.

In SUPERMAN & LOIS, after years of facing megalomaniacal supervillains, monsters wreaking havoc on Metropolis, and alien invaders intent on wiping out the human race, the world's most famous superhero, The Man of Steel aka Clark Kent (Tyler Hoechlin, "Teen Wolf") and comic books' most famous journalist, Lois Lane (Elizabeth Tulloch, "Grimm"), come face to face with one of their greatest challenges ever - dealing with all the stress, pressures and complexities that come with being working parents in today's society. Complicating the already daunting job of raising two boys, Clark and Lois must also concern themselves with whether or not their sons Jonathan (Jordan Elsass, "Little Fires Everywhere") and Jordan (Alexander Garfin, "The Peanuts Movie") could inherit their father's Kryptonian superpowers as they grow older. Returning to Smallville to handle some Kent family business, Clark and Lois are reacquainted with Lana Lang (Emmanuelle Chriqui, "Entourage"), a local loan officer who also happens to be Clark's first love, and her Fire Chief husband Kyle Cushing (Erik Valdez, "Graceland"). The adults aren't the only ones rediscovering old friendships in Smallville as the Kent sons are reacquainted with Lana and Kyle's rebellious daughter, Sarah (Inde Navarrette, "Wander Darkly"). Of course, there's never a dull moment in the life of a superhero, especially with Lois' father, General Samuel Lane (Dylan Walsh, "Nip/Tuck") looking for Superman to vanquish a villain or save the day at a moment's notice. Meanwhile, Superman and Lois' return to idyllic Smallville is set to be upended when a mysterious stranger (Wole Parks, "All American") enters their lives. Based on the characters from DC created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, SUPERMAN & LOIS is written and executive produced by Todd Helbing ("The Flash") and executive produced by Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Geoff Johns. The series is from Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television.

According to a report presented Tuesday to the Anna City Council, residents can probably expect higher water bills in the near future.
   
 The only question may be how much that increase will be.
   
 Higher demand, increasing wholesale costs and capital improvement projects have left the city facing tough options for how to fund and maintain its water and sewage systems.
   
 The city's rapid growth has necessitated the construction of many new lines. There are also several existing lines desperately in need of repair.
   
 According to one estimate, sewer line leaks cost the city an additional 5 to 10 percent each year.
   
 For 2020, the city allocated $2 million for the treatment and transportation of wastewater. That number has nearly been reached only halfway through the year.
   
 "We've got a problem and we've got to create the solution for it," Mayor Nate Pike said. "If we get on it and do it appropriately right now, we can fix this and not see a major impact down the road."
   
 Part of the problem is that the city has not had a major rate increase for several years. Now, instead of incremental changes, rates could jump as high as 15 percent at one time.
   
 City staff and council were directed to dig deeper into the issue to see what options are available.
   
 These could include a combination of additional debt, budget allocation changes and higher rates, among other things. Pike said the goal should be a healthy financial solution that has the least impact to citizens.
   
 New fire engine coming soon
   
 The Anna Fire Department should have a new fire engine by late summer or early fall.
   
 Council unanimously approved an additional $54,000 required to equip an engine purchased from the city of Coppell with a fire hose, rescue tools and equipment, communication equipment and other related items.
   
 The proposal is part of the fire department's strategic plan, which spells out vehicle acquisition and replacement through 2040.
   
 "I don't really think there's too much to discuss," Councilmember Kevin Toten said while making motion to approve the item. "We all know that this is a need and there's no way that I'm going to say 'No' to this. They deserve it plus more, so we need to do what we need to do to help them out."
   
 Watch the Road
   
 Also on Tuesday, the Anna City Council passed a resolution declaring May Motorcycle Awareness Month.
   
 Motorists are reminded that motorcyclists have the same rights and privileges as any other vehicle driver.
   
 The simple rules of motorcycle safety include being trained and licensed, wearing protective gear, riding unimpaired and riding within personal limits.
   
 One step closer to normal
   
 As COVID-19 restrictions are slowly lifted, Mayor Pike expressed his desire to get back to in-person meetings.
   
 As has been the case with most city meetings over the past two months, the May 12 council session was conducted via Zoom, and broadcast live on Facebook.
   
 The next meeting, scheduled for May 26, will be held at Anna City Hall with social-distancing guidelines observed. Space constraints in the building may still limit the number of residents who can attend in person.

The hospital plays an important role in supporting the health and vitality of Northeast Texas and Southeast Oklahoma all year long. From welcoming 36 new providers and expanding services, to investing more than $3.7 million in new clinical technology and facility improvements in 2019 alone, Paris Regional Medical Center is committed to meeting the evolving health needs of the community and enhancing access to high quality care close to home.
 As one of the region’s economic leaders, the organization employs more than 900 team members and contributed more than $8.5 million in taxes to the local and state economies last year. Additionally, it is proud to sponsor a number of local community organizations and non-profits, including the Lamar County Chamber of Commerce, St. Joseph’s Community Foundation, United Way of Lamar County and local school districts. Ensuring that everyone has access to the high-quality and compassionate care they need is a top priority for the organization and fundamental to its mission.
 In 2019, Paris Regional Medical Center provided more than $60 million of charity and other uncompensated care, regardless of patients’ ability to pay.
 “Lamar County and the surrounding region is a wonderful place to call home, and we are privileged to have a significant impact on its health and economic well-being,” said Renee Harvey, chair of Paris Regional Medical Center’s board of trustees. “As we celebrate National Hospital Week amid unprecedented challenges this year and begin to look to the future, we are aware that healthcare – like other aspects of life – might look a little different. What will not change, though, is our mission and our commitment to this community. We will continue to put the health and well-being of our neighbors first, ensuring safe places of care and a healthier community for us all.”

The mitigation efforts that include frequent sanitizing, face masks and physical distancing have worked to limit the spread of this virus — consider what today’s numbers would look like if Covid-19 had spread at the same rate as the flu. Influenza in the U.S. claims a fraction of 1% of those who contract it during a five or six month period. Covid-19 has claimed more than 6% of those who tested positive for it in just two months.
 Suffice it to say, now is not the time to be lax in mitigation efforts. Do not be lulled into a false sense of security because stores and playgrounds are open. Yes, we need the economy up and running, but we need something else too — healthy people to work, shop and pay bills.
 Remain vigilant. Wash your hands. Sanitize surfaces. Be physically distant. We’re not out of the woods yet.

 As previously reported, Allied Arts' ARTini 2020 art auction and cocktail party was originally slated for March 27, and Allied Arts announced last month plans to postpone the event to summer because of the pandemic.
 However, continuing attendance restrictions and social distancing guidelines in light of the pandemic prompted the nonprofit organization to convert this year’s ARTini into a virtual event instead.
 Last Friday’s ARTini virtual art auction featured more than 100 paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs and more by local artists. Additionally, participants had the chance to bid and win on eight silent auction packages.

It’s completed the first three phases of its overall seven phase project, which included a new lobby area, new auditorium seating and other façade and accessibility improvements.
 In addition to continuing on its building restoration work, Woods said the theatre’s board has also continued on discussions on ways it can still provide entertainment to community members remotely.
 Like so many other businesses, LTOB was forced to close its door to the general public in March as part of the governor’s executive order to stop and slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 A production of “Matilda the Musical” was halted this year as restrictions were put into place related to COVID-19 which included inviting fifth-grade students from the North Bend School District to a special performance on April 16, said Woods.
 The Rotary Coos Foundation and the Coos Cultural Coalition helped fund the special program and even purchased 175 books, of Matilda by author Roald Dahl, for each student, Woods added.
 Due to the show being canceled, Woods said they were still able to hand out the books to all the fifth-graders by including them in their school packets to take home.
 According to Woods, the board is working on ways it can continue to offer services and entertainment to the community as well as to keep their audiences connected.
 “We’re trying to figure out a way how we can bring productions to the audience,” said Woods. “We’re thinking how we can get online programming to our fans, to our patrons and to our supporters… We have some good things that are happening behind the scenes right now so we’re happy, we’re hopeful.”
