BATON ROUGE, Lou. (WLOX) - Myles Brennan and the national champions are under a week away from game one against Mississippi State. It has been a roller coaster of an off-season, especially for a team that has to replace nearly the entire offensive side of the ball from last year. Ed Orgeron has said his practices have been close to game-like in terms of physicality, but when asked about the idea of a preseason type game to sharpen up, he wasn’t overly enthusiastic.“I think that I would be against that,” Orgeron said. “I think we play enough games, to be honest with you. You go to 15 games and you add a preseason game, it could be a lot on the team. But I do see where it could help. That’s why we go preseason game one, two, and three against each other. We try to make it game-like and learn from that. But, I don’t know about a preseason game. I think it would just add to the season.”Copyright 2020 WLOX. All rights reserved.

Sorry folks… I'm as optimistic as the next guy, but show's over. There is no way to turn this ship around with the crew that's on board AND the voters who put them there. It is not repairable. Trump has done yeoman service to lay bare all that goes on, all the while being the target of some (I wouldn't even say most) of the corruption and two-tiered justice that is new ingrained into our system. We're only bitching about the stuff that we know…. certainly there have been better actors than the incompetent fools (Comey, Brennan, et al) that while in complete command, still managed to botch things so badly as to get "caught"… not that caught means anything anymore.

Two of the 15 members of the Central Committee were not present. Ian St Bernard, the commissioner of police, was ill and General Hudson Austin, Commander of the People's Revolutionary Army (PRA), was en route from Pyongyang where he had represented the PRG at North Korea's 35th anniversary celebrations. He had changed his itinerary to find the fastest route home but still would not make it back until the last day of the meeting. There was none among them whose revolutionary credentials could be questioned. Most had risked their lives in planning and executing the brilliant coup that toppled the dictator. Each was committed, heart and soul, to the success of the revolution.

"But we know what is happening -- let's be practical. Right now, people need the job. They need what they earn more than they're going to stand on this highfalutin principle that you're in breach of my contract. Right now, half a loaf is really better than no bread. So, a lot of people agree to move and some people do that voluntarily because they themselves don't want to be out in a workplace situation that exposes them to possible risk. Whilst you have this technical breach possibly occurring, the likelihood is that, from a practical perspective, you're more likely to have the employee saying, let me get on board. Now, when they get on board, the employer should really make some inquiries to ensure that they mitigate the level of risk that may be in the house when they are working."

Teenagers excitedly enlisted in the people's militia, seduced by the appeal of handling guns and defending the glorious revolution. Even from the affluent families in the posh neighbourhoods like L'ance aux Epines they came, to receive the rough and ready training. "The People are the Militia; the Militia is the People" was emblazoned on large billboards. Older folk who joined could expect to find themselves being drilled for two hours by teenaged soldiers, transported at the dead of night in a Soviet-made truck, left in a cane field far from the main road, and instructed to find themselves back. That is how it was in the immediate aftermath of the 'revo'. People of all ages and classes were mixing and cooperating, happy for an opportunity to participate in the building of a new Grenada. Revolutionary calypso songs intoned 'From backwardness and oppression to liberation and education; now that we free we have to fight illiteracy.'

John Cena was known for two things during his run as a WWE main event -- delivering great matches on big stages and be polarizing to fans. By the end of his main event run the "John Cena Sucks" chants went hand-in-hand with his entrance music, even as he gradually won over fans with gimmicks like the United States Championship Open Challenge. "The Face That Runs The Place" had always brushed off the booing fans in interviews, saying that fans were allowed to cheer for whoever they wanted. But in the latest edition of _WWE Untold_ , he went a little deeper on that thought process.
 The episode, titled "The Champ is HeRe," recapped Cena's feud with Edge from 2006 over the WWE Championship. The fan backlash towards Cena was on full display during the feud, particularly when Cena faced Rob Van Dam at the _ECW One Night Stand_ event.
 "Every time you see me come out, it's like I'm shot out of a cannon," Cena said (h/t _Fightful_ for transcript). "It's because I'm ready, I'm ready to go, and that's whether you're telling me I suck or whether you're telling me that I'm great. It's why I orchestrate you to continue to make noise because as a performer, this makes me feel 10-feet tall. Just audible reaction."
 "I love it when a group of people has so much energy that it's viscerally negative towards me," he added. "I also love it when the energy is so overwhelmingly positive, it does lift you up. It's like it's all so f--ing wonderful."
 Cena was last seen in a WWE ring at _WrestleMania 36_ , where he lost the Firefly Fun House match against Bray Wyatt and was forced to relive his greatest career failures. He recently commented on the match in an interview with _Sports Illustrated_.
 0comments
 "I've had many experiences and many stories in WWE over my tenure there, and a lot of it has been embracing conflict and embracing the tale of good versus evil," Cena said. "This isn't the first time I've done something like this. For the viewing audience, it was the first time they'd seen a cinematic depiction of this, but this isn't the first time that we've seen a conflicted John Cena character. As with all the opportunities I get in WWE, I never try to be complacent and I always like to push the envelope. This was an instance where we could do just that, and I think we put forth a product that certainly got people's attention and got people talking."
 "It left a lot of questions," he later added. "It wasn't just single-serving, it is something you can go back and watch and enjoy. Those are some of the best efforts."
