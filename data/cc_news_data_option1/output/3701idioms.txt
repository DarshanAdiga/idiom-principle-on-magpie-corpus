Nordenham Dass der Nordenhamer Ochsenmarkt in diesem Jahr aufgrund der Corona-Auflagen eine Zwangspause einlegen muss, steht für Ilona Tetzlaff fest. „Unter den zurzeit geltenden Beschränkungen ist das nicht möglich“, sagt die City-Managerin. Damit wäre eigentlich auch der verkaufsoffene Sonntag, der traditionell mit dem Ochsenmarkt verbunden ist, vom Tisch. Aber Ilona Tetzlaff arbeitet an einem Plan B, damit die Einzelhändler trotzdem am 18. Oktober ihre Läden öffnen können. Ein „Spezialmarkt“ soll’s möglich machen. Im Hinterkopf hat die Geschäftsführerin des Vereins Nordenham Marketing & Touristik, dass eine Sonntagsöffnung nicht Selbstzweck sein darf. Die Genehmigung für einen verkaufsoffenen Sonntag ist nur zu bekommen, wenn er mit einer Veranstaltung verbunden ist, die als Anlass taugt. Der unter dem Ochsenmotto stehende Herbstmarkt mit diversen Aktivitäten in der Innenstadt erfüllt diese Bedingung. Doch weil er im Corona-Jahr 2020 ausfallen muss, feilt Ilona Tetzlaff jetzt an einer Ersatzlösung. Dabei handelt es sich um ein Veranstaltungsformat, das den Corona-Auflagen des Gesundheitsamtes Rechnung trägt und auch den Verwaltungsvorschriften für offene Sonntage entspricht. Die City-Managerin steht in Verhandlungen mit einem Spezialmarkt-Ausrichter. Diese in Ostfriesland ansässige Agentur klopft zurzeit ab, ob sich genügend Aussteller für die Veranstaltung in Nordenham finden lassen. Anfang nächste Woche soll die Entscheidung fallen. Angedacht ist ein zweitägiger Markt am 17. und 18. Oktober. Weil noch einige Fragen zu klären sind, möchte sich Ilona Tetzlaff zum Thema der Veranstaltung vorerst nicht äußern. Denkbar wären zum Beispiel ein Kunsthandwerker- oder ein Töpfermarkt. Veranstaltungsort soll der Marktplatz sein. Zum Hygienekonzept gehören eine Abriegelung des Geländes mit einem Bauzaun und eine Besucherzahlkontrolle über ein Chip-System. Das bedeutet, dass jeder Besucher am Eingang einen Plastikchip erhält, den er nach dem Verlassen der Veranstaltung wieder abgeben muss. So behalten die Ordnungskräfte den Überblick, wie viele Menschen vor Ort sind. Hinzu kommt eine Erfassung der Besucherdaten. In der Fußgängerzone können gemeinnützige Organisationen ihre Stände aufbauen. Zudem soll es dort einen Imbiss- und Getränkewagen geben. Bei einem Erfolg der noch namenlosen Veranstaltung könnte sich Ilona Tetzlaff vorstellen, sie 2021 losgelöst vom Ochsenmarkt zu wiederholen. Aber auch dann in Verbindung mit einem verkaufsoffenen Sonntag.  Ob in diesem Jahr ein Weihnachtsmarkt und das Eislaufvergnügen Nordenham on Ice stattfinden können, ist noch nicht geklärt. Veranstalter Peter Böseler wartet auf eine Stellungnahme des Gesundheitsamtes.

 Sept 16 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones indexes rose on Wednesday on hopes that the Federal Reserve would continue to keep interest rates low for a prolonged period, while a slide in tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq lower.
 The central bank's two-day meeting is its first under a newly adopted framework that promises to shoot for inflation above 2% to make up for periods where it is running below that target.
 The Federal Open Market Committee will release its policy statement and economic projections at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's virtual news briefing half an hour later.
 "They have a very loose monetary policy right now and we expect that to continue ... the Federal Reserve is the stock market's best friend," said Christopher Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management in Cleveland.
 The Fed will also be releasing its "dot plot" projection of interest rates, which is a chart of dots representing the anonymous, individual rate projections of Fed policymakers for the next few years.
 The Nasdaq flitted between gains and losses in choppy afternoon trading, while the S&amp;P 500 technology subindex fell 0.6%.
 Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp fell between 0.6% and 2%, accounting for the biggest drags on the tech-heavy index.
 "The large cap tech stocks obviously have done great especially in the face of a pandemic. Now they're taking a breather," Grisanti said.
 Wall Street's main indexes attempted a comeback from a tech-driven slump earlier in the month that saw the Nasdaq Composite index slip into correction territory in just three sessions.
 At 12:54 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 194.15 points, or 0.69%, at 28,189.75, the S&amp;P 500 was up 8.42 points, or 0.25%, at 3,409.62 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 32.32 points, or 0.29%, at 11,158.00.
 Mixed data has also kept investors on edge about the pace of an economic recovery as latest figures showed U.S. consumer spending slowed in August, with a key retail sales gauge unexpectedly declining.
 Delivery firm FedEx Corp rose 6.1% after reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit, helped in part by price hikes and lower fuel costs.
 FedEx gained the most on the Dow Jones Transports index , which rose 1.2%. The index is often seen as a barometer of economic health.
 Spotify Technology SA fell 1.5% after Apple Inc announced a bundled plan for all its services that lowered the cost of Apple Music subscriptions.
 Eastman Kodak Co jumped 37% after a law firm hired by the photography equipment maker said its chief executive officer's securities transactions around the time the company learned it could receive a $765 million government loan did not violate internal policies.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 3.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.53-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
 The S&amp;P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 10 new lows. (Reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal and Devik Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)

By far her most infamous feud, Griffin's career was put on pause when she posed in a photo and video holding the likeness of President Donald Trump's bloody, decapitated head. The fallout was swift, with Griffin losing her spot on CNN, among many other jobs. Griffin apologized, but later took back the apology in a rant condemning Trump's family on "The View." Trump appeared to continue the feud as Griffin said she'd been detained at every international airport she'd visited since posting the photo. "The shows were cancelled because the President of the United States and his family were offended by an image I released and decided to unleash an army on me," she said.

You are 100% correct. People scream and scream and complain everything falls on deaf ears as far as the Board of Supervisors who are supposed to be the ones to hold her accountable. You try to ask the CEO for any information you just get a huge gigantic circular conversation that blame shifts off to everyone and 6 months later you wind up back at the point you started. It's ridiculous the games that they play and the lack of efficiency all of the money that gets awarded for Grants or new programs gets wasted and squandered down by the higher-ups before anything even happens. It's pretty gosh darn pathetic to watch this happening over and over again when smaller counties arerun much more efficiently and even larger counties run fantastically well and here we are in our swirling cesspool. No help from the higher-ups no help from the attorney general, grand jury reports fall on deaf ears. We should change the name of Mendocino County to Tarpit County. Because that's basically what happens everything gets stuck in the tar pits and that's it.

Doing that festive labor for us this year is Crypticon, the annual horror film festival that is now online thanks to insert-2020-extenuating-circumstance- here. This weekend fest, now in its 14th year, serves up the full horror spectrum in a series of shorts (plus one feature film) that run the gamut from gross to gory and eerie to electrifying. If your favorite season of _American Horror Story_ was _1984_ , I highly recommend the “In the Woods” film block. Have a nasty fantasy about boning Viggo Mortensen in _The Road_? Then buy a ticket to “Traveling Fears & More!” Or go right ahead and buy a weekend pass to get access to each delicious morsel of sick, twisted, pre-Halloween action.

WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) - An Illinois man who impersonated an IRS employee and stole nearly $900,000 has been sentenced to three years in federal prison.
 Ashokkumar Patel was sentenced Tuesday by a U.S. district judge to 40 months behind bars with a year of supervision after release, the Sprigfield Republican reported.
 Patel, of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and formerly of Worcester and Plainville, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty in Worcester federal court to conspiracy, fraud and money laundering charges for the scam that the U.S. Attorney´s Office says made $881,662.
 Patel faces deportation and was ordered to pay restitution to his victims.
 "From December 2013 to October 2014, Patel was part of a conspiracy whereby victims in the United States were contacted by individuals, primarily in India, and falsely told that they owed money to the IRS," the U.S. Attorney´s Office said. "The victims were told that in order to avoid imminent arrest they had to purchase MoneyPak, or other types of prepaid stored value cards, load thousands of dollars onto the cards and provide the serial numbers to the callers."
 According to prosecutors, the money was then used to buy prepaid cards that were used to purchase money orders that were deposited into various bank accounts, including Patel's.

Location makes a big difference. Some states have a low cost of living and affordable housing to make it easier to attract workers, while others have tax-friendly policies to make entrepreneurship easier. Some have a shortage of available and able workers, while others have a growing, well-educated labor pool. Overall, the goal for most startups is to find an affordable location that will provide access to skilled workers as well as plenty of resources to get a business up and running.

Tom McGee, president and chief executive officer of ICSC, said, “It is encouraging to see consumers planning to spend more on back-to-school this year, especially in light of the uncertainties brought on by the pandemic. Ultimately, the goal is for students to resume their education safely and effectively.”

PLYMOUTH - The Plymouth Center for the Arts is hosting its 53rd Annual Juried Art Show Sept. 19 through Oct. 25.
 The weeks-long festival is a little different this year, thanks to COVID-19, but Plymouth Center for the Arts board member Kathleen Dunn said the show will go on, with joy. Visitors will be expected to wear masks and maintain social distancing, but, for many, these precautions are becoming old hat and shouldn't stand in the way of a wonderful celebration of art in Plymouth.
 This free annual event will kick off Sept. 19, when the Plymouth Center for the Arts at 11 North St. in downtown Plymouth will throw open its doors to the annual Fall Juried Art Show. Not only will visitors view gorgeous and thought- provoking art, but they will get to see the new, fully accessible transformation of the center during its new hours of operation, from noon to 4 p.m., Wednesday-Saturday.
 The all new Artisan Shop will be open during these hours as well, where visitors can purchase one-of-a-kind pieces that make great gifts.
 While the state's COVID-19 guidelines won't allow for an opening reception, awards will be presented. All artwork will be for sale.
 Dunn said art classes resume Sept. 14, and readers should visit the Center's website, plymouthguild.org, for more information on these courses and registration.
 Here is a rundown of the festival and what you can expect.
 Saturday, Oct. 3, from 9 to 3 p.m. - The Art Stroll
 The Art Stroll will feature the works of member artists, teachers, and other local artists whose works will be on display on Main and North streets. Artists will also be selling their work. This event is free.
 Saturday, Sept. 26 through Saturday, Oct. 10 - Young @ Art Exhibit
 A showcase of young artists' works, the Young @ Art Exhibit will feature dozens of pieces of spectacular art created by kids and teens ages 7 through 18 on display at Plymouth Center for the Arts. The viewing is free during gallery hours. Remember, these have changed. They are now from noon to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday.
 Thursday, Oct. 22 - Sunday, Oct. 25 - Art in Bloom exhibit
 Art will be in bloom at Plymouth Center for the Arts for the Art in Bloom exhibit. Art in Bloom is an exhibit of dozens of floral arrangements that interpret works of art, like a call and response with flowers and other flora. Five area garden clubs contribute their floral designs to this fragrant exhibit.
