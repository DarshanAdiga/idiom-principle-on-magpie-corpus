Sushila Kaushalya Devi, who lives in Madanpur Khadar, nearly 12 km from her area of work in south Delhi's C R Park, said one of her three employers preempted the lockdown (announced on March 24) and gave her an advance to stock up on rations. This would have been okay for the month for her family of four - including her husband and two children -- had it not been for the suddenness of the announcement due to which her brother-in-law's two children, who were visiting at the time, are still with her. "The food which would have lasted the four of us an entire month got over several days ago and there's no money to buy more," she said, adding that she has been unable to collect her salary from the other two employers due to the restrictions on movement. The money can't be transferred to a bank account because she doesn't have an ATM card and the bank is too far. Married to a vertically challenged man who she said is "constantly refused work", Sushila is the sole earning member of the family and struggling to make ends meet with no money coming in for at least another month.

The government has decided to withdraw “faulty” rapid antibody test kits from use and cancel all procurement orders after it emerged that the kits from China were showing inaccurate results. “The kits will be withdrawn, and the orders will be cancelled,” said a senior government official, on the condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) chief Balram Bhargava on Monday where it was decided to cancel all procurement orders and withdraw the kits from use. Struggling to scale up testing, India imported the antibody kits from China. The first set arrived last week and was dispatched to various states. However, several countries reported problems with the kits, although China denied there were any quality issues. The ICMR started analysing results from the evaluation of antibody test kits imported from China. Expert teams were sent to eight states following complaints that the test kits had generated inaccurate results. The results from the filed test by ICMR experts showed that they were giving inaccurate results. A batch of Chinese-made kits brought by the ICMR will be pulled as they have been discovered to be unreliable, added the official. The ICMR has been also under fire for procuring the kits at a higher price after a legal dispute in the Delhi High Court between the distributor and importer of Covid-19 rapid test kits from China unearthed massive profiteering and over-pricing in kits sold to ICMR. The court observed 61 per cent mark-up on such test kits is on the higher side but more than sufficient , the Delhi High Court single bench of Justice Najmi Waziri disallowed a 145 pc mark-up from landed price of Rs 245 to ICMR's purchase price of Rs 600 per test. Instead, Justice Waziri slashed price for every kit by 33 per cent from Rs 600 to Rs 400 per test. The ICMR officials said the kits were procured at the request of the states. As reported by ET, a DGHS led panel of experts disclosed that the decision to procure antibody test kits was taken by the ICMR without enough consultation. The ICMR had earlier last week halted antibody testing for two days after receiving complaints about inaccuracies. On Wednesday, it reiterated that the must follow the “prescribed protocol” and use the tests only as a surveillance tool for Covid-19 cases. The ICMR said that they will return the antibody test kits to the suppliers as the results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity. ICMR evaluated the kits of Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics in filed conditions. The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purposes. States are advised to stop using these kits procured from these companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers, it said in a statement.

That's why he announced at a recent daily coronavirus briefing-cum-rally his eagerness to bring professional sports back quickly. Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned -- "We have to get our sports back. I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old" -- the sport that truly matters to him is football, the only major mass entertainment (other than Trumpism) that endorses tribalism and toxic masculinity so flagrantly and keeps violence in vogue. Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality.  
 Whether or not the president can survive the loss of the 2020 baseball season -- already poisoned by last year's Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal \-- is up for grabs.
