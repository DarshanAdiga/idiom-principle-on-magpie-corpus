The Bank of England (BoE) has arrived to support the economy and pound bulls are cheering. Brexit may provide another leg higher as the GBP/USD pair is refreshing session tops around 1.3070, Yohay Elam, an Analyst at FXStreet, reports. Key quotes "The BoE has announced it will expand its bond-buying scheme by £150 billion to £895 billion, exceeding estimates of a more modest £100 boost. Moreover, the BoE refrained from setting negative interest rates, prompting investors to price that adverse development out." "Democratic candidate Joe Biden is nearing the presidency after winning Michigan and Wisconsin. To become the 46th President of the United States, the former Vice-President needs to win two out of three states that will likely be declared on Thursday - Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia. Otherwise, it goes down to the wire in Pennsylvania." "Markets seem to cheer the falling chances of a contested election as well as fresh stimulus hopes. While Republicans may limit Democratic desires to raise taxes and impose new regulations, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seems open to state aid - a thorny topic in talks about a new relief deal." "Apart from waiting for further election developments, the Federal Reserve's rate decision is on the docket. While the bank is unlikely to change its policy, comments on the economy are of high interest. Daily coronavirus cases have topped 100,000 and that may weigh on the economy." "It seems that the only brake on GBP/USD comes from Brexit talks. After several days of reporting progress, negotiators hit a snag on Wednesday, sending sterling lower. The see-saw is set to continue, and any upbeat headline could boost sterling."

Nov 5 (Reuters) - Plane and train maker Bombardier Inc missed estimates for third-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by weak performance in its aviation and transportation units due to coronavirus-led disruptions.
 The Montreal-based company, which is in the process of closing a deal to sell its rail division to French train maker Alstom SA, said revenue from its transportation unit fell 2.5%.
 Business jet deliveries were also lower in the quarter, falling to 24 units from 31 a year earlier, but revenue from the business rose about 10% as its flagship Global 7500 jet made up for a third of those deliveries.
 Bombardier's EBITDA and margins took a hit on costs related to the Global 7500 jets and lower deliveries during the quarter.
 Bombardier, which aims to break even on free cash flow in 2020, reported quarterly free cash flow of $706 million.
 The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $176 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $255 million a year earlier.
 Analysts on average were expecting EBITDA to be $179.8 million, according to Refinitiv data.
 Revenue fell 5.3% to $3.53 billion. (Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Anil D'Silva)

D’Wan gets a lot of work, a lot reps, and competes really hard at that and continues to improve. When he shows us that he is the better guy, then he will be the guy up. Same thing with JT — JT probably doesn’t get as many opportunities as Stetson does and D’Wan does because we works with us some down there on the scout team. But, at the end of the days guys, the decision has to be made by us that gives us the best chance to win. We do that based on the total body of work. Those are decisions that have to be made.”

2) The terms adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Therefore, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. We define adjusted net earnings as net earnings attributable to common shareholders before severance, acquisition and other costs, net mark-to-market losses (gains) on derivatives used to economically hedge equity settled share-based compensation plans, net losses (gains) on investments, early debt redemption costs, impairment of assets and discontinued operations, net of tax and non-controlling interest (NCI). We define adjusted EPS as adjusted net earnings per BCE common share. We use adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS, and we believe certain investors and analysts use these measures, among other ones, to assess the performance of our businesses without the effects of severance, acquisition and other costs, net mark-to-market losses (gains) on derivatives used to economically hedge equity settled share-based compensation plans, net losses (gains) on investments, early debt redemption costs, impairment of assets and discontinued operations, net of tax and NCI. We exclude these items because they affect the comparability of our financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in business performance. Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. The most comparable IFRS financial measures are net earnings attributable to common shareholders and EPS. The following table is a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to common shareholders and EPS to adjusted net earnings on a consolidated basis and per BCE common share (adjusted EPS), respectively.

 As of the morning of Nov. 5, Tokyo time, we still do not know which one of the two will be the case. What I am more concerned about, however, is the ramification of the 2020 U.S. election results in the years to come. Hillary Clinton lost in 2016, but who is losing in 2020? Here are some thoughts:
 In my last column I erroneously referred to a ninth “extra scenario” that predicted an overwhelming landslide victory in the presidential election. I said, “Trumpism will not go away. That is because Mr. Trump did not create the populist, nationalistic, xenophobic and discriminatory movements — they found him in 2016.”
 Although a landslide victory never happened, I may be right in predicting that Trumpism will survive the election — whether Trump wins or not. Without moderate conservatism and realistic liberalism, American politics will most likely continue to remain polarized, making the country difficult to govern.
 Can American voters really stop the degradation of U.S. politics? Probably not. Did they make the right decision on Nov. 3? Maybe. At least, they did their best, but that may not be enough for the U.S.'s allies and friends in the Indo-Pacific, Europe or the Middle East.
 In 2016, in my view, Trump did not win; Clinton just lost. In 2020, did Biden lose or did Trump? It remains to be seen. However, one thing is for sure, the real losers are the American people and their friends around the world. What we have lost is the powerful, united, internationally minded good-old America of the past several decades.
 No matter what the results will be, I am beginning to realize that the 2020 U.S. elections may forever change the United States unless the next administration in 2021 takes measures to fix the situation. Those who deal with the United States, friends and foes alike, must face the new reality.

4) The term free cash flow does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Therefore, it is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities, excluding cash from discontinued operations, acquisition and other costs paid (which include significant litigation costs) and voluntary pension funding, less capital expenditures, preferred share dividends and dividends paid by subsidiaries to NCI. We exclude cash from discontinued operations, acquisition and other costs paid and voluntary pension funding because they affect the comparability of our financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in business performance. Excluding these items does not imply they are non-recurring. We consider free cash flow to be an important indicator of the financial strength and performance of our businesses because it shows how much cash is available to pay dividends on common shares, repay debt and reinvest in our company. We believe certain investors and analysts use free cash flow to value a business and its underlying assets and to evaluate the financial strength and performance of our businesses. The most comparable IFRS financial measure is cash flows from operating activities. The following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow on a consolidated basis.

 Take Jennifer Lopez for example. He's given her bombshell hair, a wavy bob, Rapunzel-length extensions and even chunky '90s highlights. Bear in mind that Jen is just one of his clients, Kim Kardashian being one of the others.
 So, while I quite literally threw my 2020 diary in the bin, Chris has been filling his up and providing with daily inspiration.
 His latest work, is something of a throwback to one of my personal all-time favourite shows, Gladiators. You know the one, with the Scottish referee and the men and women in leotards running up a travelator.
 Think voluminous crimped curls that are so big they must be hiding a ton of secrets. She even has that side part that makes us want to re-watch every single episode of _Saved By The Bell_ and cry all over Zack and Kelly's wedding again.

 If this is true, it comes as no surprise – _The Umbrella Academy_ is one of Netflix’s most-streamed shows. After _season 2’s cliffhanger_, however, confirmation of its return is still good news – especially after the cancellation of other popular shows on the streaming platform like _GLOW_.
 Season 2 saw the superpowered siblings avoid the apocalypse by being transported back to different points in 1960s Texas, thanks to Five’s (played by Aidan Gallagher) temperamental time-travelling abilities. Their interference in the past was set to cause more destruction, however, and it was up to Five to round them all up again.
 The cast has previously spoken about what they want to see from season 3, with Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan (who play Luther and Klaus Hargreeves) revealing that they’d like to return for a feature-length episode.
 “I certainly like the idea of doing different proliferations,” _Sheehan told us earlier this year_. “The idea of it becoming a sort of a big superhero feel, I wouldn't be.”
 “I think the magic of the show is that it is very grounded and it's not all superhero-y stuff,” Hopper added. “We season it with the superhero stuff, but the reason people love it [is] because of the people behind the 'superheroes’.”

AMARILLO, Texas (KCBD) - Repair work is nearly complete more than one week after winter storms knocked out power for many customers of Xcel Energy. The company says its crews are finishing up repairs on its power grid. Energy to nearly 54% of Texas customers lost power during Winter Storm Billy on Oct. 27,28 and 29. Freezing rain on the South Plains, and snow in the Panhandle weighed down tree limbs, which fell and damaged hundreds of service connections, according to Xcel. “This storm ranks as one of the worst winter storms to hit us in recent memory because it affected almost every section of our Texas service area,” David Hudson, president, Xcel Energy – New Mexico, Texas, said. “It was quite an ordeal for many customers, especially those who were without power for days on end, and we’re so grateful for everyone’s patience and understanding as our crews worked night and day to restore service.”More than 1,500 wooden poles, 4,500 cross-arms and nearly 50 miles of wire and cable have been replaced. Xcel even called in line workers from New Mexico, Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota and other parts of Texas to help local crews.Now, the company will assess some of the steps it took prior-and-during the storm to see if any changes are needed in response efforts.“We never stop learning from these events, but one thing is certain, our communities and our employees are always ready to do what it takes to overcome these hardships,” Hudson said. “We are so thankful for all the help we received across the region, and for the kindnesses shown by our communities and customers to our employees and contractors who worked so hard to restore the region’s power grid.”Copyright 2020 KCBD.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has received a request from UEFA to adjust the handball law again to provide more flexibility for referees and prevent players being unfairly punished.
 In a letter to Infantino seen by The Associated Press, UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin asked for the November meetings of the game's lawmakers to consider allowing referees to determine again whether a player handled intentionally or not.
 Čeferin's intervention came after a spate of penalties being awarded because balls have -- even unwittingly --\- hit outstretched or raised arms.
 "The attempt to strictly define the cases where handling the ball is an offense has resulted in many unfair decisions which have been met with growing frustration and discomfort by the football community," Ceferin wrote.
 UEFA has no say in the laws of the game despite running the world's biggest club competition -- the Champions League -- and having the most most popular domestic leagues on the continent. The International Football Association Board is instead controlled by FIFA -- which has half of the eight votes -- and the four British associations from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

 ADDIS ABABA, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Countries pressed Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Thursday to halt a military campaign in the Tigray region to avert civil war, but sources said he showed no sign of backing down from confrontation with a powerful ethnic faction.
 Federal troops and regional forces clashed in the northern region on Wednesday, after Abiy ordered them to respond to an alleged attack on government forces in the region by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
 The TPLF was the dominant political force in Ethiopia's multi-ethnic ruling coalition for decades, but quit after Abiy, a member of the Oromo ethnic group, took office two years ago and reorganised the coalition into a single party.
 Countries in the region fear that the crisis could escalate into all-out war under Abiy, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a decades-old conflict with neighbouring Eritrea but has had to contend with outbreaks of ethnic unrest.
 Tensions with the TPLF have been escalating since September, when Tigray held regional elections in defiance of the federal government, which called the vote "illegal". In recent days, both sides accused each other of plotting a military conflict.
 Sources said efforts were under way behind the scenes to encourage talks, pushed by the African Union. But the initiative was being resisted by authorities in Addis Ababa who insist they have to eliminate a threat posed by the TPLF.
 "The Ethiopians are saying it is an internal matter and they will handle it. They are saying it (TPLF) is a rogue element within their border and this is about the rule of law," said a diplomatic source who did not wish to be named.
 Redwan Hussein, spokesman for a newly-established State of Emergency Task Force, told Reuters on Wednesday that the option for talks was "not yet" on the table.
 Dozens of federal troops were killed during the first day of fighting, one diplomat told Reuters, adding that the death toll could be higher.
 There was no word on casualties suffered by the TPLF. The government has cut all phone and internet communication in the region.
 The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to back Abiy in a tweet, which urged immediate action to restore peace and de-escalate the situation but backed the government account that the TPLF was responsible for violence.
 "We are deeply concerned by reports that the Tigray People's Liberation Front carried out attacks on Ethiopian National Defense Force bases in Ethiopia's Tigray region," Pompeo wrote.
 Ethiopia has suffered multiple outbreaks of violence since Abiy took office. At the weekend, gunmen killed 32 people and torched more than 20 houses in another part of the country, in the west.

The ground claiming the number of ballot watchers inside when counting location was insufficient. But the Health Department calling the police after saint the building was at capacity. I did just rocks and trying to use stop the votes being counted. It's about it I thought it was important to come down here and makes it that didn't happen. The unrest coming as five states remained too close to call including Arizona were Biden holds a slight lead and I can tell you that the attitude. And that the White House tonight is. My night we focus on Arizona for a political perspective. That's where they think they can break through a create a new conversation. In Pennsylvania the counting continues the secretary of state saint there ahead of schedule. It carries had been chatting around the clock. Yeah everybody's tired but incredibly dedicated to getting this done. And now the race tightening in Georgia. Drums lead shrinking overnight after workers scanned the final absentee ballots in Fulton County the State's most populous county which includes Atlanta.

But should those three extra days of ballots matter we believe will prevail the Supreme Court and divided this morning feeling confident he will win once the votes are counted.

We have to stop treaty and our opponents. As enemies. We are not enemies. What brings us together as Americans is so much stronger. Than anything they can tear us apart.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The death toll in last week’s Aegean Sea earthquake rose to 116 on Wednesday as rescuers in the Turkish city of Izmir finished searching buildings that collapsed in the quake.All but two of the victims were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city. Two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos, which lies south of the epicenter of Friday’s earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey registered the quake’s magnitude at 7.0, although other agencies recorded it as less severe.Mehmet Gulluoglu, head of Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, said search and rescue operations had been completed at 17 buildings that fell in Izmir. The rescue operation has been roaring at full tilt since Friday, pulling 107 survivors from the rubble.Of the 1,035 people injured in the quake, 137 remained hospitalized on Wednesday, the agency added.Following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged not to give up until the final person was recovered. Rescuers' spirits were raised Tuesday when they pulled a 3-year-old girl from the wreckage of her family home 91 hours after the quake.The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Some 1,700 aftershocks followed, 45 of which were greater than 4.0 magnitude.In Izmir, the quake reduced buildings to rubble or saw floors pancake in on themselves. Authorities have detained nine people, including contractors, for questioning over the collapse of six of the buildings.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and new buildings make of cheap or illegal construction that do not withstand earthquakes well. Regulations have been tightened to strengthen or demolish older buildings, and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities, but experts say it is not happening fast enough.The country sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The Company withdrew its annual sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance in May 2020 based on not being able to forecast its results with reasonable accuracy due to uncertainties surrounding the impact COVID-19 related factors would have on it. While the Company has seen steady and consistent improvement in its business since that time, there is still considerable uncertainty about what impacts these factors will have on it in the coming quarters, particularly in light of recent increases in infection rates across North America. Assuming a relatively stable situation for the balance of 2020, the Company is expecting to continue generating year over year improvement in its sales and adjusted EBITDA through the fourth quarter, however, due to the seasonality of many of its businesses, the degree of this improvement will likely not be to the same extent as achieved in the third quarter.

So, Ross and Rachel are clearly an example of what _not_ to do. But does taking a relationship break ever work? Ross and Rachel did end up getting back together, after all. But perhaps because no one can agree on what "taking a break" means, there hasn't been a lot of research into the pros and cons of doing so. But one 2009 study of on-again, off-again relationships among college students found that on-off couples were more likely to report negative experiences, including communication problems and uncertainty, and less likely to report positive feelings, including love and understanding from partners, than other types of couples. And a 2004 study of young adults found that only one-third of couples who broke up and got back together again actually stayed together in the long term.

Another very strange report comes from the 1950s, by a woman who claims her great aunt had told her of this experience. One day she was visiting this great-aunt, who lived on a rural farm in the Southern United States, and asked why she always sat out on the deck with a fully loaded shotgun near at hand, and that was when the elderly woman told of a truly terrifying experience she had had in the 50s. She told her that one evening their dogs and farm animals had suddenly all gone nuts, restless, panicked, and making a racket outside. Dogs were barking, pigs were squealing, and it was just an utter cacophony of noise, making her think that something was very wrong. She then says she grabbed her shotgun and headed outside to check it out, and that was when she would come face to face with something that would change her forever.

In Arizona, supporters have declared victory on Prop 208, a surtax on the top 4 percent of wage earners to fund public education. It currently has 52.5 percent of the vote, with not much left to count. The tax comes out of the “Red for Ed” movement, and would finally bring needed funding to schools in the state, which have yet to recover from the cuts imposed after the 2008 financial collapse. Another tax increase for education (among other things), the commercial property tax hike in California known as Prop 15, has been trailing narrowly, but the late absentees could easily put it over the top. That would vanquish the ghost of Prop 13 and the tax revolt it inspired. Arkansas approved the permanent extension of a half-cent sales tax to fund roads. (In fairness, a progressive tax system failed in Illinois, although it was not tied to specific funding.)

The driver of a highway help van spotted what he thought was a disabled car and saw Lavigne "huffing" the contents of an aerosol can used to clean electronic equipment. The van driver then called state police, according to Trooper Scott Grimes' report.
 An ambulance crew was called but Lavigne refused treatment.
 When Trooper Patrick Haynes arrived minutes later, he noticed the car was still running. He also saw an aerosol can in Lavigne's lap. He ordered Lavigne to turn off the car but he could not. He also had trouble giving the trooper his driver's license and registration.
 A few moments later, Grimes arrived and spoke to the van driver and Haynes. He then went over to Lavigne and tried speaking to him.
 "Mr. Lavigne appeared to be dazed and confused, his pupils were enlarged and he appeared to have dry mouth when he spoke," Grimes wrote in his report.
 Eventually, Lavigne took and failed a series of field sobriety tests and was charged with driving while under the influence.
 At the Newbury state police barracks, Lavigne spoke to Grimes about the effects of "huffing," saying it was "different from a heroin high and that it was quicker, not lasting long," Grimes wrote in his report.

Nov 5 (Reuters) - China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd beat estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, as its core e-commerce business continued to grow following China's emergence from coronavirus lockdowns.
 The results come on the heels of China's surprise suspension of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group's record $37 billion Shanghai listing that was viewed by analysts and investors as an attempt to cut founder Jack Ma and his financial services empire down to size.
 Alibaba's results also coincide with U.S. presidential election results, with Democrat Joe Biden edging closer to victory.
 Under Donald Trump's presidency, the world's top two economies have clashed often over trade, forcing many Chinese companies to put off U.S. listings or return to exchanges close to home.
 Revenue at Alibaba's cloud computing business, a focus area for the company, jumped 60% to 14.9 billion yuan.
 Sales from Alibaba's core e-commerce business rose 29% to 130.92 billion yuan in the reported quarter.
 Net income slumped 63% to 26.52 billion yuan, as the company had booked a one- time gain last year from its 33% equity interest in Ant Group.
 Revenue rose 30% to 155.06 billion yuan in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to estimates of 154.74 yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
 The company's U.S.-listed shares, which have gained about 39% this year, fell 1.8% in trading before the bell. (Reporting by Munsif Vengattil and Josh Horwitz; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)

Chicago White Sox center fielder Luis Robert won a Gold Glove Award in his rookie season.
   
 Chicago Cubs shortstop Javier Baez finally won his first Gold Glove in his seventh season of excelling in the infield while Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo took home his fourth award.
   
 In St. Louis, Cardinals outfielder Tyler O'Neill won for the first time. Although second baseman Kolton Wong won for the second time, his honor comes a week after taking a call from the club saying they would not be exercising his $12.5-million option for 2021.
   
 National and American League winners were announced Tuesday night.
   
 White Sox
   
 Robert is the first Sox rookie to win the award and the fifth Sox outfielder, joining Ken Berry (1970), Tommie Agee (1966), Jim Landis (1961-64) and Minnie Minoso (1957, '60).
   
 "I have always dreamed of winning a Gold Glove, so this is a dream come true," Robert said in a statement. "I joked around this season with (infielder) Yolmer Sanchez about the possibility of winning it one day and being a Gold Glover like him."
   
 Robert, who is one of three finalists for AL Rookie of the Year, sometimes showed his range by stepping in front of left fielder Eloy Jimenez to make a catch. He had a .994 fielding percentage, committed one error in 154 chances, led all AL outfielders in total chances and ranked sixth in the league overall in defensive WAR (1.0).
   
 Cubs
   
 Baez, who moved between several infield positions during his first five seasons, said he appreciated settling in at shortstop on a full-time basis in 2019.
   
 "It's a different feeling when you have that commitment to that position," Baez said on ESPN's awards show Tuesday night.
   
 Baez is the first Cubs shortstop to win a Gold Glove since Don Kessinger in 1970.
   
 Baez committed eight errors in 56 games, but because of the truncated 60-game season, qualifications were limited to two types of defensive metrics: those from batted ball location-based data and those gathered from play-by-play accounts, including information from MLB Advanced Media's Statcast, Sports Information Solutions and STATS LLC.
   
 "I go for my defense, and people recognize me for my defense," he said.
   
 Rizzo is one of three Cubs first basemen to earn a Gold Glove with fellow four-time winner Mark Grace (1992-93, 1995-96) and Derrek Lee (2005, 2007).
   
 "To win a Gold Glove is something I'll never take for granted," said Rizzo.
   
 Cardinals
   
 "Such a punch to the gut," Wong said Tuesday night from his home in Hawaii. "I gave my heart and soul to the organization. Working my way up, learning, going back to the minors, and then to battle, to work, to figure things out, and to fight my way back up -- that was everything to me. I know I can be better. And just as I'm starting to figure out what my game brings to this new age of baseball."
   
 Since free agency opened this past weekend, Wong has heard from at least a half dozen teams with interest. A source previously confirmed the Los Angeles Angels as one of those teams.
   
 A Cardinals official said they hope to talk to Wong as the free-agent market develops.
   
 Wong was hoping for that conversation, not just a call.
   
 "That was shocking to me because I get it, I get what the season was like," Wong said. "If they wanted to restructure my contract because of COVID-19, I'm in. Let's have that talk. If they want to backload my deal, OK, let's talk. I understand this is a business, and I'm still open to it. Keep that door open while looking at others. I love being a Cardinal. I was there for seven years, and I've done so many things with that organization. It's where I wanted to finish off, in St. Louis."
   
 O'Neill won his first career Gold Glove in part because of his four Outs Above Average, which tied with teammate and center fielder Harrison Bader for the 12th-best among outfielders at any position. O'Neill led all left fielders; the next closest had 1 OAA. He did not commit an error in 344 innings, and he had 89 putouts in left field. That was the most in the National League.
   
 Derrick Goold of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and Mark Gonzales and LaMond Pope of the Chicago Tribune contributed to this story.

The U.S. senator from Mississippi is one of the worst candidates to assume that office. She cowered from Chris McDaniel in 2016 and she cowered from Mike Espy in 2020. Instead of debating, she hid — just like she always does.
 Her refusal to debate Espy is a travesty of politics. If not for the left-wing Democrats having gone completely bat-(poop) crazy — with apologies to bat poop — Espy would be an attractive choice over Hyde-Smith (or should we go back to her 2016 nickname Hide-Smith?)
 But she got re-elected because of two words — Donald Trump.
 In 2018 after Thad Cochran’s retirement, then-Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hide- Smith to the Senate. She then had to win a race against McDaniel and Espy. Trump swooped in for a campaign rally to endorse Hide-Smith in the primary, ending the McDaniel campaign.
 McDaniel admitted it freely that the Trump endorsement scuttled his campaign. Hide-Smith then went head-to-head with Espy and, in a Republican-dominated state, eased into the Senate.
 She secured a full six-year term in the Senate with a close win over Espy. She won because Donald Trump was on the ballot and that brought out the masses. She rode Trump’s coattails back to the Swamp, where she is in the pocket of the powerbrokers and The Godfather — Haley Barbour.
 But guess what? The next time Hide-Smith will have to run will be 2026. Trump will not be on the ballot. She will have no coattails to ride. When a decent Republican challenger emerges in 2026, Hide-Smith will easily be primaried and shown the door.
 She should write thank-you notes to the president — and then get ready to go back to the farm in 2026.

 I sometimes wonder what it would be like if I could throw out my opinions for the masses in complete anonymity. Would it change me? Would I be bolder? Or do I pretty much put my opinions out there in this column, under my photo with an email address attached?
 Our website allows people to comment “anonymously,” and some of the drivel that comes out of those keyboards is astounding. The thing is, not one time will these cowards have the guts to actually attach a name to their toxic invectives.
 But that will not stop them from berating columnists, editorial writers and those who write letters to the editor — who do have the guts to attach their names to them.
 Someone with the name “Satans_taint” — which should tell you all you need to know — called a longtime letter writer a “senile old man” for his Second Amendment views. The man who wrote the letter is a frequent letter-writer and always attaches his name. Such cannot be said for the coward Satan. He pillories those views in which he, she, it or they do not like, then hide behind a keyboard in a basement bunker afraid that someone might find out who he, she, it or they might be.
 A few of “its” comments have been directed specifically at Publisher Jim Cegielski, who has been putting out his opinions for more than 25 years with a name and photo attached. So what are you so afraid of, Satans_Taint?
 I most look forward to receiving a response. You can find my email address at the end of this column.

 If Trump wins, weep at those who will destroy our cities out of irrational violence. But also go back and watch footage of cable news anchors and “experts” trying to figure out how on earth they got it wrong again.

County coordinator Ryan Odden noted the concerns of the COVID-19 emergency executive committee including options on modifying how the board meets: fully remote; partially remote; limited number of people in-person; no change. The commissioners have been meeting in the Wadena city council chambers instead of the county small courtroom and since the chambers are owned by the city the requirements such as wearing masks need to be followed, as county attorney Kyra Ladd and Odden said. If the city closed their building again due to the pandemic the commissioners would need to relocate.
 “The question is as leaders of the county should … we go fully remote or partially remote or as-is? Do we decide something today? Should we kick the can down the road? Should we see if there’s more data that we should think about or whatever,” said commissioner Chuck Horsager.
 The commissioners will continue to meet in-person with considerations on limiting the number of people present with Zoom still being offered for presenters, the commissioners and the public.
 The what-ifs are becoming more apparent with the increase in positive COVID-19 cases, with Wadena County having 329 cumulative positive cases as of Nov. 4.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Disappointed Democrats headed Wednesday toward renewing their control of the House for two more years but with a potentially shrunken majority as they lost at least seven incumbents without ousting a single Republican lawmaker.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., talks to reporters about Election Day results in races for the House of Representatives, at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2020. She was joined on a video call by Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ()By Wednesday afternoon, Democrats' only gains were two North Carolina seats vacated by GOP incumbents after a court-ordered remapping made the districts more Democratic. Although their majority seemed secure, the results were an unexpected jolt for a party that had envisioned gains of perhaps 15 seats. They were a morale booster for Republicans, who going into Election Day were mostly bracing for losses.“They were all wrong,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters about Democrats' assumptions of adding to their House numbers. Repeating a campaign theme Republicans used repeatedly against Democrats, he said, “The rejection that we saw last night from the Democrats, was that America does not want to be a socialist nation.”McCarthy also touted his party’s modest additions to its small cadre of female and minority lawmakers. “The Republican coalition is bigger, more diverse and more energetic than ever before,” he said.In perhaps their highest profile triumph, Republicans finally defeated 15-term Rep. Collin Peterson from a rural Minnesota district that backed President Donald Trump in 2016 by 31 percentage points, Trump’s biggest margin in any Democratic-held district. Peterson, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, is one of the House’s most conservative Democrats but was defeated by Republican Michelle Fischbach, the former lieutenant governor.The latest Democratic incumbent to fall was freshman Rep. Abby Finkenauer of northeastern Iowa, who lost to GOP state Rep. Ashley Hinson.The other defeated Democrats — all freshmen — included Reps. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala, health secretary under President Bill Clinton, in adjacent South Florida districts.Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico and Kendra Horn in Oklahoma also lost. All had won surprising 2018 victories in districts Trump carried decisively in 2016.The fight for Torres Small’s seat cost around $35 million, making it one of the country’s most expensive races, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. She was defeated by Yvette Herrell, a former state legislator.Before votes were counted, both parties' operatives said the GOP would be fortunate to limit Democratic gains to modest single digits. Democrats control the House 232-197, with five open seats and one independent. It takes 218 seats to control the chamber.Democrats were also disappointed in the Senate, where they nursed fading hopes of winning the majority. Trump’s challenge from Democrat Joe Biden remained too early to call.A smaller Democratic majority would make it tougher for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to unite her lawmakers as a handful of progressive freshmen arrive for the new Congress.By retaining House control, Democrats would mark only the second time in a quarter century that they’ve led the chamber for two consecutive two-year Congresses. The first period ran from 2007 through 2010, when Pelosi was serving her first four years as speaker.“Our purpose in this race was to win so that we could protect the Affordable Care Act and so that we could crush the virus,” Pelosi told reporters, citing former President Barack Obama’s health care act. She declared that Democrats had won the House majority, which seemed highly likely but hadn’t been officially determined by The Associated Press.Democrats' hopes of protecting their majority and even expanding it were based on public anxiety over the pandemic, Trump’s alienation of suburban voters, and a vast fundraising edge. But those advantages didn’t carry them as far as they’d hoped.Democrats' setbacks were measured not just by seats they lost but by districts they failed to capture.Democrats lost a majority Hispanic district in West Texas they expected to win after the GOP incumbent retired. And they lost a series of what seemed coin-flip races, failing to defeat GOP incumbents in Cincinnati, rural Illinois, central Virginia and the suburbs of St. Louis and several districts in Texas.In a district between Austin and San Antonio, freshman GOP Rep. Chip Roy withstood a challenge from Democrat Wendy Davis. Davis gained fame as a state legislator by waging a 2013 filibuster against an anti-abortion bill, then lost a race for governor the following year. The conservative Club for Growth made her its biggest target, spending over $6 million against her this year.As if symbolically, Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was in her own tight race in a closely divided district she won by 24 percentage points in 2018.Democrats also notched no victories in long-shot races they’d hoped would bolster their majority. Republicans retained such seats in central North Carolina; Montana; Omaha, Nebraska; and around Little Rock, Arkansas.Some endangered Democratic freshmen like Texas' Lizzie Fletcher, Georgia’s Lucy McBath and New Jersey’s Tom Malinowski and Andy Kim held on. And as Wednesday progressed, other hotly fought races remained undecided in Indiana and Virginia.Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the three other members of the so-called squad of young progressive women of color were easily reelected. A small handful of new progressives will be coming to Washington including Democrats Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones of New York, but others like Nebraska Democrat Kara Eastman lost their races.Jones will be Congress' first openly gay black lawmaker, while another newcomer from New York, Democrat Ritchie Torres, will be its first openly gay Hispanic.Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has espoused unfounded QAnon conspiracy theories, won a vacant seat in northwest Georgia. Trump has called Greene a “future Republican star.” QAnon asserts that Trump is quietly waging a battle against pedophiles in government.Republican Lauren Boebert, a guns-rights activist and bar owner from western Colorado, won an open GOP seat there.Hanging over the contests were the coronavirus pandemic and the wounded economy, which voters ranked as top concerns, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate. The virus has killed 232,000 people in the U.S. and cases are rising in nearly every state, while millions have lost jobs.Democrats thought Trump’s repeated false statements downplaying the virus' severity would redouble the impact of their long-time focus on health care.Buoying Democrats was a coast-to-coast edge in campaign fundraising. That allowed nearly all Democratic incumbents in potentially vulnerable districts to outspend their GOP challengers, often by vast margins, according to an AP analysis of Federal Election Commission campaign reports.AP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 127,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.___Find AP’s full election coverage at APNews.com/Election2020.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The COVID‑19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the economic environment in Canada and around the world. On March 13, 2020, in order to limit the spread of the virus, the Québec government imposed a number of restrictions and special preventive measures, including the suspension of business activities deemed non‑essential across Québec. Since then, the Québec government has gradually implemented a reopening plan, which was followed at the end of September by a second set of restrictions due to the second wave of the pandemic. This new plan includes regional restrictions according to the alert level of each region and remains subject to change as the pandemic evolves. This health crisis curtailed the operations of many of Quebecor's business partners and led to a significant slowdown in some of Quebecor's segments in the first nine months of 2020. Among other impacts, the first wave of measures to prevent the spread of the COVID‑19 virus has led to a significant reduction in volume at Videotron retail outlets and delays in client migration to its new Helix entertainment and home management platform; lower advertising revenues, a significant decrease in sports events broadcast by the TVA Sports channel, and reduced film and audiovisual content activity in the Media segment; and cancellations of shows and events, and interruption of music and book distribution activities in the Sports and Entertainment segment. Activity has since partly resumed at some of Quebecor's affected business units by the health crisis, particularly those involved in retail sales and distribution, sports broadcasting and film and audio‑visual content production. However, the business slowdown continues and the recovery remains very fragile, particularly with the pandemic entering its second wave. Quebecor has continued and will continue to provide essential telecommunications and news services during this health crisis, while safeguarding the health and safety of the public and its employees. Videotron and TVA Group also took a number of important initiatives to make life easier for their customers, such as temporarily suspending certain fees. Furthermore, Videotron's network has been able to handle the increase in traffic since the beginning of the health crisis, including the impact on network usage from the significant growth in teleworking, which demonstrates the soundness of its strategy of continuously adding capacity ahead of the curve. Because of the slowdown in the economy, approximately 10% of Quebecor's workforce has received benefits under the Corporation's assistance program while on stand‑by. During the health crisis, this program provides financial assistance in addition to the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy or Canada Emergency Response Benefit programs.

NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart is laying off the robots it had deployed in about 500 stores to keep tabs on what’s on and not on the shelves.The retailer said Monday it has ended its relationship with startup Bossa Nova Robotics, which builds roving robots equipped with cameras for identifying out-of-stock and misplaced products.Walmart said in a statement it has “worked with Bossa Nova for five years and together we learned a lot about how technology can assist associates, make jobs easier and provide a better customer experience.” It said it is still testing other new technologies for tracking inventory and moving goods.The Wall Street Journal was first to report the ending partnership Monday, citing unnamed people familiar with the situation who said the retailer found human workers could get similar results. There was also some concern about how shoppers reacted to robots doing the work, according to the report.Bossa Nova, which was founded in 2005 in Pittsburgh didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Monday.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

What Pelosi has proven adept at is bashing progressives, mocking extremely popular policy items, and openly antagonizing activists who likely saved Joe Biden’s skin in Michigan, Arizona, and Minnesota. She’s boxed them out of the legislative process and passed bills over their objections. That’s an impulse she has in common with Bustos, who kicked off the 2020 election cycle by blacklisting all political consultants, strategists, and vendors who worked with primary challengers within the Democratic Party. This was a preemptive strike at progressives, threatening to ice them out of lucrative DCCC contracts to disincentivize them from working for challengers (implicitly and exclusively challengers on the left, as was widely understood and has been _extensively catalogued_ ). That plan backfired spectacularly; 2020 proved to be the most successful election cycle yet for progressives in primaries, as they _responded_ by building a stronger-than-ever campaign apparatus.

Nov 5 (Reuters) - Plane and train maker Bombardier Inc posted a 31% fall in third-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by weak performance of its transportation unit due to COVID-19-driven disruptions.
 The Montreal-based company, which is in the process of closing a deal to sell its rail division to French train maker Alstom SA, said revenue at its transportation unit fell 2.5%.
 Business jet deliveries were also lower in the quarter, falling to 24 units from 31 a year earlier.
 Bombardier, which aims to break even on free cash flow in 2020, reported quarterly free cash flow of $706 million.
 The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $176 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $255 million a year earlier.
 Revenue fell to $3.53 billion from $3.72 billion. (Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni)

Lo afferma l'assessore regionale alla Salute, Nicoletta Verì. L'Abruzzo è stato collocato in zona gialla, sulla base dell'indice RT e di 21 indicatori individuati dal Ministero della Salute. Questa valutazione si riferisce alla situazione "fotografata" al 25 ottobre scorso e ogni settimana si procederà a una rivalutazione di tutte le Regioni sulla base del rischio dinamico. La collocazione all'interno di una fascia comporta la permanenza all'interno della stessa per due settimane.
 "Va ricordato a tutti", sottolinea l'assessore, "che la classificazione delle Regioni viene aggiornata automaticamente, a intervalli periodici definiti, sulla base degli indicatori ministeriali. L'Assessorato sta monitorando costantemente i Servizi Flussi delle diverse Asl, così da avere un quadro preciso per calibrare le azioni di Governo clinico. Dobbiamo però impegnarci tutti, ognuno per la sua parte, affinché i nostri parametri restino a un livello compatibile con lo status attuale, scongiurando un peggioramento che comporterebbe enormi problemi per l'intera comunità abruzzese".
 La Verì torna a chiedere il rigoroso rispetto dei protocolli di sicurezza sanitaria da parte dei cittadini. "Siamo in una fase cruciale", conclude, "in cui ognuno di noi deve fare la sua parte. E allora indossiamo sempre la mascherina, manteniamo il distanziamento sociale, igienizziamo spesso le mani e ricordiamolo anche a chi ci sta intorno. Potrebbero sembrare frasi fatte e invece si tratta delle armi più efficaci per contrastare la diffusione del contagio. Basta davvero poco per aiutarci in questa battaglia impari contro un nemico così insidioso, preservando sia la nostra salute, sia la tenuta del nostro sistema sanitario regionale".

Nov 5 (Reuters) - The New York Times Co beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, as more people subscribed to its digital news products during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Shares of the publisher were up nearly 4% before the bell.
 The company has been focusing on its subscription-based news, crossword and podcast products for years to cut its reliance on advertising revenue and offset a decline in print readership.
 Advertising sales have been unpredictable as companies slashed ad budgets to cope with a sharp drop in business due to cronavirus-led lockdowns.
 Revenue from subscription rose 12.6% to $300.95 million in the third quarter, while ad revenue dropped 30.2% to $79.25 million, the company said.
 Total revenue fell 0.4% to $426.9 million, but came in above analysts' estimates of $411.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (Reporting by Ayanti Bera and Tiyashi Datta in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)
