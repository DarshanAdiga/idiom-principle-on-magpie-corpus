Shado beni, culantro, Chinese parsley, Mexican coriander, long leaf coriander and saw tooth coriander are herbs with a similar flavour to the more common and readily available coriander or cilantro. It's a flavour vital to many cuisines - Mexican, South American, Indian, Asian, Caribbean - and loved the world over, but for a substantial chunk of the population, it tastes like dish soap. Haters have a gene that lets their taste buds perceive a chemical in the plant that's used in soaps. Curiously, that gene can switch on and off throughout a person's life; a hater can become a lover. Coriander also refers to the citrusy seeds of the plant, which are dried and used whole or ground.

The problem with trying to make a marriage great is that the focus is on looking at what’s wrong. Then we try to “fix” it. We don’t like a certain habit, such as our spouse being perpetually late. So we set our sights on changing our spouse. But we should work on changing ourselves so we respond differently, even when we find ourselves late through no fault of our own. Once we get a handle on how to do that, we may believe our marriage will get better—at least until the next annoying habit invades our facade of contentment.

Back in spring, when toilet paper was running low and COVID-19 anxiety was high, Andi Barness-Rubin made the brave decision to venture forth to the grocery store. And there at the threshold, staring her in the face, was an object of dread and possible infection — the shopping cart.
 Now, this mother of three and marketing professional, who splits her time between Flagstaff and Scottsdale, had always been vigilant about cleanliness and hygiene in public. So always, without fail, she would wipe down the cart’s handle.
 But with the pandemic raging and uncertainty about how the coronavirus was transmitted, this self-confessed “germaphobe” was freaking out a little.

(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Monti Datta, University of Richmond (THE CONVERSATION) America’s national security officials are on alert and global markets shook – at least briefly – following the announcement that President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. As someone who studies the U.S.‘s image, I am curious about the geopolitical implications of the leader of the free world falling victim to the pandemic, and how America’s allies, adversaries and others might use this moment, or ones in the weeks and months ahead, to their advantage. I am also reminded of a famous quote from the Austrian diplomat Klemens Wenzel Furst von Metternich, who in 1848 said, “When France sneezes, the whole of Europe catches a cold.” He probably didn’t think his warning about the global implications of a respiratory disease would ever literally come true. American adversaries like Russia, allies like the United Kingdom and regions with mixed relations like the Korean peninsula are all watching carefully to see what this illness at the top might mean for them, even as the president returns to the White House. Given the overall decline in America’s standing in the world in recent years, it may be that Trump’s illness isn’t at important as the U.S. national security community would think. Or, the world may continue to wait cautiously until Trump’s health is out of the woods. A cautious eye from Russia Russia is a formidable adversary with a curious relationship to Trump. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1989, Russia sought to expand its influence in world affairs, seeking to regain power and prestige lost...

The good news is that just as a water source can transform a dry creek into a flowing stream, restoring trust through _heart-invested_ actions will eventually help build a thriving relationship. Over time, you and your mate will experience moments of relief and refreshment. But it takes more than just a few weeks for that trust to be replenished. Most often, it takes a number of years of steady growth for a marriage to reach the point where a full and unwavering trust is in place. When this happens, it’s the result of consistent accountability and sharing heart to heart through many transparent conversations.

The boil water notice ending does not eliminate the risk of Naegleria fowleri in city water. TCEQ still urges residents not to get water up their noses, avoid putting their heads under water and allowing children to play with things like Slip-n-Slides or hoses. Residents should still run their water for five minutes before using it.
 City Council and staff have not considered a utility bill discount in light of the water disaster in the city, but don’t want residents to bear the brunt of the operations the situation requires.
 People should report if their water bills increase, City Manager Modesto Mundo said, since the bills should not reflect the opening of fire hydrants done near their homes or businesses in order to flush old water out of the system and bring in new water.
 However, the bills coming out will reflect a 35-day water cycle, so they might be higher than the previous bill, which reflected a 28-day cycle, Mundo said. The city has eight 28-day cycles and four 35-day cycles.
 Residents will still be expected to pay for their utility usage, unless the council decides otherwise. That item has not been on any council agendas, including the meeting they had Monday.
 Utility bills typically bring in $1.1 million per month. Water makes up $420,000 of that, while sewer is $435,000 and garbage is another $269,000, city staff said.
 Water is billed per 1,000 gallons used. Running a faucet for five minutes, as the city has recommended residents do during the flushing process, uses about 10 gallons of water.
 At that meeting, Mundo reported the water disaster has cost them about $48,000 so far, and all of that is payroll. They haven’t factored in the cost of chlorine, food and other things.
 The city would have to spend a threshold of $1.38 million to be reimbursed by the state or federal government, Mundo said. They will likely be a “far cry” from that, but will keep tracking expenses in case, he said. Insurance would likely not cover costs either, since insurance covers expenses from significant events, not costs of compliance, he said.
 The city has reserve funds in case they’re needed, including $4.6 million — 31 percent of the city’s annual operation budget — in an operating reserve fund, an anticipated transfer of $1.1 million from this year’s budget savings and another capital fund of $2.48 million, Mundo said.
 “I think we have enough cash on hand to get us through this emergency,” he said.
