THE DCGA government is working behind the scenes to have Malaita Provincial Secretary Fredrick Fa’abasua either returned to Honiara or sacked even. A reliable source revealed that DCGA though the Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening (MPGIS) is doing everything in its capacity to have PS Fa'abasua return to Honiara or kicked out as PS for Malaita Province. In the latest move, MPGIS is working behind the scenes to have the Malaita PS signature removed from the Provincial Bank Account. Information obtained claimed that the Malaita PS only returned to his workstation without signing any agreement with the responsible ministry to have him reinstated after his untimely recall which triggered the protest in Auki back in September of this year. The MARA executive has passed a resolution in support of the PS to remain in office. However, by the look of things, the responsible ministry has not taken the resolution seriously as it keeps on pushing for Mr. Fa'abasua to have his signature removed from the Provincial Bank Account. The MARA government together with the provincial workers and Malaita public sees the current PS as the right person for the job and any move to remove him from the office will not go down well with Malaita Province. The continuous pressure from the DCGA through the MPGIS ministry to have the PS removed from office has raised eyebrows as to whose interest the national government serving. Malaita Provincial Government, its workers, and the public of Malaita want the PS to remain in office to continue to serve the interest of the province. An insider who is familiar with this move said that it is no secret that the current DCGA government through MPGIS is trying to weaken the MARA government leadership on many occasions but failed. The insider said that Malaita Province cannot afford to lose PS Fa'abasua. The PS has been credited for strengthening the Provincial Administration within a year and continues to serve the province to the best of his ability with loyalty. The hidden intention to remove the Malaita PS was further revealed by a DCGA minister in Auki on Friday of last week. The senior DCGA minister revealed the whole plan to remove the Malaita PS will eventuate when a new Deputy PS is recruited for Malaita Province. Malaita Province has been operating without a Deputy PS for the past two years for some unknown reasons. The Malaita Provincial Government on numerous occasions asked the MPGIS to recruit a Deputy PS to assist the current PS but the call continues to fall on deaf ears. When contacted to speak on the matter, Malaita Premier Daniel Suidani said that the current move to remove the PS is concerning and his government is ready to handle whatever eventuates. "It is saddening that the national government chooses not to listen to the wishes of the people of Malaita through its executive government's resolution," he said The outspoken Premier said, "Such decisions and behavior exerted by the National Government are unwelcomed both by the MARA government and the vast majority of Malaitans that believed that PS Fredrick is the right person for the job and has worked well for the Province since taking office." The Premier said Malaita Province is ready to recruit PS Fa’abusua should he be removed by the national government. By WILSON SAENI Auki News Bureau

"Although Pat won't be working side-by-side with our administration anymore, I still look forward to working with him as a member of a fellow Mountain East Conference institution," Bamberger added.
 Prior to taking over his new role during 2018-19, Snively served as Associate Director of Athletics for NCAA Compliance, a position he held since 2012.
 As Head Swim Coach, Snively led the Falcon women's swim team to the first-ever Mountain East Conference Championship in 2018, with senior Marlena Dudek becoming the only swimmer in the MEC to earn All-America honors at the 2018 NCAA Division II Swimming & Diving Championships. The Falcons swept MEC Swimmer of the Year honors that season with Dudek on the women's side and Alex Quintao on the men's side. Fairmont State freshman Courtney Deem also earned MEC Freshman of the Year honors, and was named the Swimmer of the Meet at the 2018 GMAC/MEC Championships.
 That season, Snively earned MEC Coach of the Year honors for his efforts. The conference championship was also the first for the Fairmont State women's program.
 During his 20 years at Fairmont State, Snively was awarded the American Swimming Coaches Association (ASCA) Certificate of Excellence nine times and was also named the WVIAC men's Coach of the Year in 2005. He has coached student-athletes to 26 All-American performances, 91 school records, 11 conference Swimmer of the Year awards, and eight National Swimmer of the Week honors.
 Snively earned his bachelor's degree in Architectural Engineering Technology from Fairmont State in 1999 and his master's degree in Physical Education/Athletic Education Technology in 2000 from West Virginia University. He also earned a Master's in Business Administration from Fairmont State in 2014. In the fall of 2012, Snively was recognized by the Fairmont State Alumni Association as an "Outstanding Young Alumnus" for his distinguished career as a coach and his service to the Fairmont community.
 Active in the community, Snively volunteered with the American Cancer Society and the American Red Cross. He created Swim for Life as a fundraiser for the Fairmont Area Swim Team and the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life. He coordinates fundraising efforts with his family to benefit the Marsha K. Snively Memorial Fund and the Cruetzfeldt-Jakob Disease Foundation to raise money to research the disease that took his mother's life in 2007. Most recently, he and his wife Amy began working with the United Way of Marion and Taylor Counties as board members and were involved in fundraising events through the Fairmont State campus campaign and Marion County's Dancing with the Stars, breaking fundraising records in each. Last year, the two chaired the community campaign that raised over $500,000 for local non-profit agencies.
 This past June, Snively was named to the College Swimming & Diving Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) Board of Directors. Snively also earned a Level 5 certification from the American Swimming Coaches Association of America (ASCA) in June 2018. Snively was also a member of the NCAA Division II Swimming & Diving Committee from 2016-2018 and chaired the committee in his final year.
 Snively is married to Fairmont State alumnus Amy Greene Snively.

This makes such jobs appealing to at-risk groups such as people with compromised immune systems or elderly family members. For many people, working from home or making contact-free deliveries is less risky than working in an office, store, or restaurant. Independent contractors often have more flexible hours than traditional employees, allowing workers to avoid public transportation during rush hour and accommodate lockdown-era family responsibilities, such as remote schooling. For people who have lost their job, a gig-style job can help make ends meet during a job search that could last a while.

Most of U-M's 21 pledges have — perhaps a bit surprisingly — remained fully committed to the program during the horrendous 2020 campaign, though a few are inevitably on the fence as tomorrow approaches, such as Jacksonville Sandalwood four-star linebacker Branden Jennings, Plantation (Fla.) St. Thomas Aquinas three-star cornerback Ja'Den McBurrows, Fresno (Calif.) Central four- star wideout Xavier Worthy, Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) St. Thomas Aquinas four- star athlete Jaydon Hood, etc.
 On the flip side, it would be _very_ surprising if the Maize and Blue don't add at least one more pledge. West Bloomfield (Mich.) High four-star running back Donovan Edwards is the main name fans will be keeping an eye on, with the 5-11, 193-pounder currently residing as the No. 74 overall player in the country.
 A surprise commitment could potentially be in the works as well, just as it oftentimes is on Signing Day (perhaps one from a top 100 in-state prospect currently committed elsewhere?).
 If things fall into place and the Wolverines land Edwards and hold onto their current four-star pledges, Michigan's class could move up in the rankings. How high U-M's class rises will be impacted, though, by what the teams around it do.
 Alabama, Ohio State, Oregon, Georgia, Clemson, LSU and Florida (in that order) are the programs who are currently ahead of Michigan in the rankings, with six of those seven teams (Florida being the exception) holding 22 commitments or fewer.
 In other words, they're still all likely to add to their respective classes tomorrow.

 Dear Dave,
 I've got so many things I want to address and change about my life, both personally and professionally, in the coming year. Do you have any advice or practices for helping people be successful and achieve their goals?
  _Tim_
 Dear Tim,
 Goals are dreams, but you can't stop with just dreaming. Examining your goals inside and out, and by thoughtfully constructing small, achievable steps toward them is the key to creating change in your life. Remember, too, that it's your responsibility - not someone else's - to fix things in your life. If you're waiting for someone or something else to make things better, you're going to be disappointed.
 When it comes to setting and achieving goals, be specific about what you want to achieve. Vague, unspecified ideas will only cause you to feel overwhelmed, and this will likely lead to you giving up. Also, make your goals measurable. If you want to lose weight, don't simply write down \"lose weight\" as a goal. How much weight do you want to lose? How many pounds would you have to lose per week in order to see the desired result in a specified amount of time?
 This one may sound silly, but are the goals you have in mind your goals? If a spouse or friend sets goals for you, you're probably not going to succeed. Creating a goal, and taking ownership of it, will give you more incentive to meet your goal. Setting a time frame will help you develop more realistic goals, too. And last, always put your goals in writing. Write them down, and review them often. This will provide you with added motivation to make your goals a reality.
 Successful people examine and reassess their lives on a regular basis. When they realize changes need to be made, they start living intentionally, in writing, on paper and on purpose!

 The game was already salted away at 64-41 when Taz Sherman, who is making a big imprint on this year's team with his sharpshooting that has him at 49.2 percent from the field and 50 percent from 3-point range to rank third on the team in scoring at 12.4 points per game, stole the ball from Richmond.
 He got the ball off to Cottrell, the feature freshman out of this year's class, who in turn spied Bridges, the former Fairmont Senior star who spent last season redshirting to hone his game and body rather than doing so in a prep school, breaking loose on a fast break.

Since being promoted to Senior Associate Director of Athletics in 2018, Snively assisted with the day-to-day operations of the department by providing support and leadership development to all athletics staff members and coaches. Snively also worked specifically with student-athlete development – a new institutional initiative aimed to enhancing the student-athlete experience.
 "Serving as the head swimming coach at my alma mater for two decades has been one of the greatest sources of joy and pride in my life," said Snively. "I wouldn't trade any of my experiences as a student-athlete, assistant coach, head coach, staff member, faculty member, or administrator here for anything. Each experience has prepared me well for this next step.
 "Fairmont State has given me so much. I received a great education. I met the love of my life. I found gainful employment that I loved in a community that I love. I worked with many great student-athletes and colleagues. And now that I am taking a leap of faith to a new opportunity, I feel I have given Fairmont State and this community my best in return and I hope the culture and team- above-self atmosphere we've created within the swimming program will carry on for years to come.
 "I am very excited for the opportunity to lead the Wheeling University athletics department. It is my chance to make my mark in a very unique and special way," Snively remarked. "While it is difficult to leave Fairmont, it is great to have the opportunity to stay in the Mountain East Conference. I look forward to many future successes for both institutions and their teams."
 In his administrative role, Snively provided department leadership in each of the following areas: administration, fundraising, coach leadership development, policy implementation, strategic planning, promotional strategies, and diversity and inclusion programming.
 "I would like to congratulate Pat on the tremendous opportunity he has received to further his career in athletics administration," said Bamberger. "Pat has been a tremendous asset to Fairmont State University and the Fairmont community for the past two decades and we wish him the best of luck as Director of Athletics at Wheeling University.

NFL playoff spots up for grabs: How to win some serious cash

Harbaugh has one year remaining on a six-year deal and is the only Power Five coach entering the last year of his contract. He said Monday that yes, recruits have asked about it and insisted that yes, he wanted to be back at Michigan.
 He reiterated that again Tuesday.
 “If you were on these calls, you’d be inspired, too, and I am talking to the youngsters, their families,” Harbaugh said. “Their passion for attending Michigan, their focus on getting a degree from the University of Michigan and playing football at Michigan … that focus is inspiring. You would love to be on those calls, as I am.”
 Harbaugh has received a lot of criticism for his team’s performance this year, a 2-4 squad that didn’t win a home game and survived in triple overtime at Rutgers. He’s said in the past he tuned out criticism and looked forward, but he’s facing a lot of pressure to right the ship.
 Fan criticism has been at an all-time high, with many wondering if he should be allowed to extend with a rumored three-year deal in the works.
 “I do talk to the fan base,” Harbaugh said. “They’ve been so supportive. They love Michigan. We’re on the same team. I think they’d really love our players if they knew them all.
 “They are inspired by them; I’m inspired by them. We’re going to keep pushing, and that continues today, that continues tomorrow, the next day and all the way to Saturday and beyond. I’ve got great appreciation for the support we get from the Michigan fan base.”
 He also expressed support for his team despite its struggles this year.
 “I did say I really liked this team. I mean … [I] love this team,” he said. “I’m most impressed with how they handle themselves, how they’ve handled a lot of the adversity. I think it’s made them stronger. I think they’ve grown. I think that serves them well now and going forward …
 “There are a lot of people in general even in the football world that once the new year starts, the next year starts, they get very passionate about what their resolutions are going to be — get on fire, going to do more, going to work harder — we’re still in that. So, let’s get on fire, let’s get passionate, let’s do that today, tomorrow, the next day, while we’re still in this season. That can start today.”
 It starts later now given that the season is over with the cancellation of Saturday’s game with Iowa. Harbaugh, however, has Wednesday Signing Day to look forward to, and he and Manuel can now decide on the next course of action for the program.

Another player facing a big challenge was Oscar Tshiebwe, the big man from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who had played only five minutes last game and had seen his statistics from his freshman season last year decrease. Huggins admitted after the last game that he expects much more from Tshiebwe.
 Well, he got it today as Tshiebwe scored 12 points on 5 of 8 shooting, had six rebounds and three assists.
 Assistant coach Erik Martin may have helped get Tshiebwe straightened out after the last game.
 "I like Coach Martin because after the North Texas game he waited for me," Tshiebwe said. "We talked and said he said the game of basketball does not worry about how you are playing, just that you are playing hard. You have to forget the last game and go out, have fun and play hard. Then you will dominate."
 As much as Tshiebwe did in this game, Huggins believes it's just scratching the surface.
 "I expect to see a lot more," Huggins said. "He's getting better, starting to become more and more the old Oscar, but I expect a lot more."
 It was hard to find a Mountaineer who didn't have a big game. Derek Culver had almost a daily double-double with 10 points and 11 rebounds while also showing he plays the game to the hilt by diving for a ball as it was going out of bounds while the Mountaineers were well in charge of the game.
 Taz Sherman chipped in with 15 points on 5 of 7 shooting and Sean McNeil hit 5 of 8 shots including both the 3s he took to finish with 12 points.
 And, as good as the offense was, Sherman spent some post-game praising the defense.
 "I think we did a good job turning defense to offense and getting the ball to guys who could make shots," Sherman said. "When you start seeing shots go in one after another it gives your defense a boost. I thought our defense was the catalyst today."
 For the second straight game, Huggins changed the flow of the action by going to a press in an effort to speed up the Richmond offense and that completely changed the context in which the game was being played.
 The Mountaineers get this week off before opening Big 12 play at Iowa State.

But what I am still trying to learn is allowing for that tenderness, versus [going into fight mode]," Jada shared, without getting specific about relationships.      "I think that has a lot to do with the fear of being hurt. You don’t want to feel rejected, you don’t want to feel unloved. Being programmed, and believing, 'Girl, don’t let those tears come, because you will fall apart and you might not be able to put yourself back together again,'" she admitted.      The group also offered advice to _Red Table Talk_ viewers during the episode, while Willow and Adrienne shared their personal heartbreak -- both romantic and not.      "This year has really been the passing of my mother-in-law," Adrienne shared. "It was [due to] COVID. It was very painful. And then not being able to gather and celebrate her life the way we ordinarily would."      "I have had [a lot of romantic heartbreak in my life]," she noted. "This one particular failure in one of my marriages that I really built up in my head that this was my one true love and I’ll never love like this again. It wasn’t a divorce that I wanted but at the end of the day when you really, really look at the relationship honestly it’s like, 'This one's going nowhere but to divorce.' I really feel like you have to kind of take some time and be honest with yourself."      Willow, meanwhile, got candid about the heartbreak she's experienced within her own love life. The 20-year-old is rumored to be dating Tyler Cole.      "I have had some personal decisions I needed to make this year that were really hard. I just had to just learn how to set some boundaries in my romantic relationship/ships, and I am so grateful that my partner was just open to what I had to say," Willow said. "And when you truly love someone, no matter what you are gonna want what’s best for them. I felt like I was almost making the situation bigger than it needed to be because once I stepped up to the plate and made the decision I needed to make, it was almost as if all of the stress and heartbreak I was feeling beforehand was [gone]."

Bloomberg) -- Trucks in China connected to G7’s fleet-management network do more than just haul goods across the vast nation.
 Using Internet of Things technology, they can employ anti-fatigue cameras to call out bad driving, built-in advanced driver-assistance systems to send warnings about insufficient space between vehicles on highways, and real-time cargo weighing to prevent stealing.
 Beijing-based G7 aims to monitor all steps along a product’s logistics journey, from warehouse to delivery, remotely. Covid-19, which has seen a jump in online shopping as people stay home and avoid crowds, has presented an added opportunity, with customers including FedEx Corp., Amazon.com Inc., China Post and Walmart Inc. more focused than ever on security and tracing, according to G7 founder Zhai Xuehun.
 It’s ultimately aimed at making logistics more efficient. Reducing the cost of transporting goods means higher margins for not only trucking companies but also manufacturers. Consumers benefit too through lower costs and products that arrive on time and in better shape.
 Logistics costs in China accounted for around 15% of economic expansion in 2019, versus single digits in Europe and the U.S., a discrepancy that underscores the imperative for China to lower the expense, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Teo.
 “Logistics demand in China is growing rapidly, driven by the fast growth of e-commerce,” Teo said. “The number of parcels that logistics companies have to handle is rising, so there’s a need to improve efficiency in order to lower unit costs.”
 G7, which was founded in 2010 and takes its name from the G7 Beijing–Urumqi Expressway, the world’s longest desert highway, collects a plethora of other fleet information too, ranging from how many times drivers use their cellphones while on the road to how many times they stop to refill gas and what electronic payment methods they rely on.
 Its technology can also provide real-time updates on a truck’s payload and temperature, helping to ensure goods that need to remain cold, for example, are delivered in optimum condition.

 “There’s never been so much emphasis put on China’s circulation industry since the country was established,” Ren Xingzhou, former head of the market-economy research unit under the Development Research Center of the State Council, said at a conference last month. “The efficiency of circulation and logistics directly impacts overall economic development.”
 G7, which has already attracted backers including Temasek Holdings Pte and Tencent Holdings Ltd., is working on plans to start a new round of funding and may consider an initial public offering at some point, Chief Financial Officer Zhang Jielong said, declining to elaborate. The company’s last fundraising round was in 2018 when it raised money at $1.2 billion, Zhang said.
 And demand from investors, particularly in China, to get in on the ground floor of the technologies that will power tomorrow is rising. SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund 2 is leading a $113.5 million investment round in a California-based startup called Flock Freight that seeks to change the way goods get trucked around the U.S., a person familiar said earlier this month.
 Other G7 backers include Eastern Bell Venture Capital Management Co., Hopu Investment Management Co., Bank of China Ltd. and Tsinghua Holdings Venture Capital Co. The company has raised a total of $510 million over six rounds, according to Crunchbase.
 “The next decade will bring an era of deepening digitalization,” Zhai said from G7’s headquarters, where a wall-sized screen displays real-time data and images of the some 1.8 million vehicles connected to the company’s platform. “The digital and visual management of logistic fleets will be our historic contribution to the industry.”

In 2001, Vice President Al Gore presided over the counting of the 2000 presidential election he narrowly lost to Republican George W.

Dear Dave,
 I've got so many things I want to address and change about my life, both personally and professionally, in the coming year. Do you have any advice or practices for helping people be successful and achieve their goals?
 Tim
 Dear Tim,
 Goals are dreams, but you can't stop with just dreaming. Examining your goals inside and out, and by thoughtfully constructing small, achievable steps toward them is the key to creating change in your life. Remember, too, that it's your responsibility - not someone else's - to fix things in your life. If you're waiting for someone or something else to make things better, you're going to be disappointed.
 When it comes to setting and achieving goals, be specific about what you want to achieve. Vague, unspecified ideas will only cause you to feel overwhelmed, and this will likely lead to you giving up. Also, make your goals measurable. If you want to lose weight, don't simply write down "lose weight" as a goal. How much weight do you want to lose? How many pounds would you have to lose per week in order to see the desired result in a specified amount of time?
 This one may sound silly, but are the goals you have in mind your goals? If a spouse or friend sets goals for you, you're probably not going to succeed. Creating a goal, and taking ownership of it, will give you more incentive to meet your goal. Setting a time frame will help you develop more realistic goals, too. And last, always put your goals in writing. Write them down, and review them often. This will provide you with added motivation to make your goals a reality.
 Successful people examine and reassess their lives on a regular basis. When they realize changes need to be made, they start living intentionally, in writing, on paper and on purpose!

Hitting that 80% figure, however, could prove to be a challenge. According to a Pew Research Center survey from a few months ago, 49% of Americans said they wouldn't take a COVID-19 vaccine due to fears about side effects. The good news is that number has dwindled in light of how effective Pfizer's vaccine was in clinical trials and the relatively mild nature of observed side effects.

Real had enjoyed a remarkable last week, beating Sevilla and Borussia Moenchengladbach before a comprehensive 2-0 win over local rivals Atletico to ease the pressure on coach Zinedine Zidane after a stuttering start to the campaign.
 The Frenchman made only one change to the starting 11 that had beaten Atletico, bringing in Federico Valverde for the suspended Casemiro, and his side's heroic recent efforts seemed to have taken their toll in the early stages of the game.
 Athletic, meanwhile, made an energetic and aggressive start and could have had a penalty when Inaki Williams was pushed over in the area by Dani Carvajal.
 Moments later, they were down to 10 men after Garcia charged into a tackle on Kroos and was deservedly shown a second yellow card.
 Madrid really struggled to take advantage but their quality eventually shone through.

Este martes, la agencia de calificación de crédito Fitch Ratings cambió la perspectiva de Perú de “estable” a “negativo”, debido a que “la baja cohesión política y de instituciones desde el 2016 podría socavar la capacidad del próximo Gobierno de implementar un amplio rango de reformas fiscales, políticas y de productividad económica”, según comunicado. ¿Qué significa esta calificación para la economía peruana? El ex ministro de Economía, Luis Miguel Castilla, indicó que “la señal no es positiva”. Pero primero pidió contextualizar este anuncio, porque Perú era el único país que mantuvo la perspectiva y el rating en Latinoamérica. Incluso Chile sufrió una variación. Asimismo, precisó que el ratio principal para medir la percepción de riesgo del país y su calificación es el ratio deuda-producto. Incluso con el aumento en el endeudamiento, como lo dice el informe de Fitch, el Perú con 33% en la actualidad se ubica por debajo del promedio de los países calificados con “BBB” (53%). Eso por el lado positivo. “Por el lado negativo, Fitch identifica tres temas. El primero es que el populismo le ha pasado factura al país y dudan de la capacidad del gobierno entrante de tener un suficiente soporte político por un Congreso fragmentado, que le permita contener las iniciativas de gasto”, indicó Castilla. Como segundo tema, creen que el hecho de la inestabilidad política crónica ha hecho que el crecimiento potencial del país sea menor al que prevé el gobierno, y eso lo ponen como un factor de riesgo. El tercer factor negativo que se señala en el informe, sostuvo el exministro, es que encuentran difícil que dadas las circunstancias políticas actuales, el gobierno pueda incrementar los ingresos permanentes por 1,5% de PBI. Esa cifra aparece en el último Marco Macroeconómico Multianual 2021-2024, pero no dice cómo lograr aumentar los ingresos por este monto. En esa línea, lo que dice Fitch es que ellos dudan que en el corto plazo (en el próximo año o dos) se logre adoptar la reforma tributaria, que permita aumentar los ingresos por ese monto. Por su parte, el ex viceministro de Economía, Enzo Defilippi, comentó que este es el resultado “del irresponsable Congreso que tenemos y su búsqueda de popularidad a todo precio”. Si bien el Perú ha sido la estrella económica hace tiempo –entre otras razones por el cumplimiento de sus compromisos, lo que nos permitía mantener y mejorar la calificación pese a la precariedad política-, “lo que estamos viendo ahora es que hemos llegado a un nivel que ya ni la fortaleza macroeconómica del Perú puede evitar que se dude de la voluntad política para cumplir con los compromisos”, apuntó Defilippi. Sostuvo que Fitch lo dice claramente que es el tema político el que hace dudar de la capacidad del Perú de hacer lo que hay que hacer para mantener la casa ordenada. Para el experto, la situación de las finanzas públicas del Perú es precaria. Y se deben reconstruir esas fortalezas haciendo cambios que van a ser dolorosos, como pagar por impuestos, y dejar de gastar en ciertas cosas. “Eso requiere una madurez política por parte del Congreso y lo que estamos viendo es totalmente lo contrario. Lo que augura esto con respecto al siguiente Congreso es similar o peor. Por lo tanto, el próximo gobierno cómo va a poder hacer las reformas necesarias”, refirió. “La señal no es positiva y eventualmente a futuro, lo que va a hacer es encarecer los intereses que debe pagar el Perú por su deuda externa. También el rating soberano es un referente para el costo de capital en el mercado doméstico de capitales. Entonces también encarecería también el costo de financiamiento para el sector privado que se fondea por el mercado de capitales”, subrayó el exministro Castilla. La clave, manifestó, es que Perú no pierda el grado de inversión, porque muchos inversionistas no podrían comprar deuda peruana, si es que Perú no tiene grado de inversión y este no es el caso. “Todavía no estamos cerca a ese escenario, pero sí todas las alertas están prendidas”, manifestó.

At halftime, West Virginia was shooting a ridiculous 66 percent and as they broke the game completely open to lead 52-30 over the nation's No. 19 team.
 That led Coach Bob Huggins to observe, "When we make shots, we're pretty good. When we don't turn the ball over, we're even better."
 WVU had only 12 turnovers that led to just 9 points for Richmond.
 The Mountaineers not only shot well — now there's an understatement, considering that late in the first half they made nine straight baskets and closed out the half making 10 of 12 shots — but they did so because they finally passed the ball like Huggins wants them to.
 Miles "Deuce" McBride took the reins of the Mountaineers in this one coming off a bad shooting game against North Texas. He led the way with 20 points on 9 of 11 shooting to go with five assists while being guarded by Jacob Gilyard, the Atlantic 10's Defensive Player of the Year last year and considered a candidate for National Defensive Player of the Year this season.
 But before the game, Huggins indicated on the radio that he wasn't sure Gilyard was the kind of on-ball defender who could handle a player as skilled as McBride.
 "Gilyard is not Jevon Carter," Huggins said. "He does a lot off the ball. He hangs around the opponent's glass, which most little guys don't do, and swats the ball out guys' hands. He does a lot of terrific things on defense but he isn't a great on the ball defender."
 WVU tested him right away by running a play for McBride down low and it worked for a basket, leaving McBride certain that he could get what he wanted when posting up on the 5-foot-9 Gilyard.
 McBride understood the challenge he faced and eagerly proved himself against a player considered one of the best defenders in the nation.
 "I knew he was one of the best players in their conference — the A-10 is no joke. Watching film, I knew we had a tough matchup but I knew our game play pretty well and just came out [and] executed it," McBride said.

Clearly the COVID-19 pandemic has had an effect on corporate attitudes. Many employers are now embracing work-at-home arrangements that make physical location less important and the Bay Area has been seeing an outward migration to communities, such as Sacramento, with less congestion and lower housing costs as a result. In that sense, moving headquarters staff to low-cost Texas buys more bang for the buck and makes perfect sense.

The arrival of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine will hopefully put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic over the next 13 months. In the meantime, everyday activities like indoor dining may not be fully safe until September of next year, at the earliest. Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine is encouraging, but the worst of the pandemic is yet to come. According to Dr. Fauci, January will likely be the worst month we've seen yet. With the coronavirus vaccine from Pfizer already being administered to healthcare workers, there's a lot of optimism that we're finally on a path towards moving past the pandemic once and for all. And while that optimism may be well-founded, the vaccine is far from a quick fix. If anything, many
