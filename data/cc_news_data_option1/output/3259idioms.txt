For the time being, the closer role will remain up for grabs although it seems Kapler will likely be inclined to give veteran left-hander Tony Watson the first crack at the job. Tyler Rogers and Jarlín García are also candidates to pitch in high-leverage situations in the ninth inning, but for now, the Giants have to pick up the pieces and reevaluate every reliever's role in a struggling bullpen.

All Shares validly tendered will be bought-back to the extent that the aggregate number of Shares bought-back pursuant to the Offer will not thereby exceed the Maximum Number of Shares. If the number of Shares validly tendered exceeds the Maximum Number of Shares, the number of Shares to be bought-back from each Accepting Shareholder will be reduced proportionally so that the number of Shares bought-back by the Company in aggregate is equal to the Maximum Number of Shares. Further details of the procedures for scaling down are described under the section headed "Other Terms of the Offer" below;

Pursuant to Rule 32 of the Takeovers Code and Rule 6 of the Share Buy-backs Code, if as a result of a share buy-back, a shareholder's proportionate interest in the voting rights of the repurchasing company increases, such increase will be treated as an acquisition of voting rights for the purposes of the Takeovers Code. Consequently, depending on the level of acceptances received from the Accepting Shareholders pursuant to the Offer and taking into account the fact that each of the Funde Shareholder and the Shougang Shareholders has irrevocably undertaken to the Company that they will not accept the Offer for the Shares held by them respectively as at the Latest Practicable Date, the aggregate interests in the total issued Shares held by (i) the Funde Concert Group may increase from its current level of approximately 29.99% to a maximum of approximately 31.48% and (ii) the Shougang Concert Group may increase from its current level of approximately 29.85% to a maximum of approximately 31.33%, in each case upon completion of the Offer, thereby triggering an obligation by the Funde Shareholder and the Shougang Shareholders under Rule 26 of the Takeovers Code to make a mandatory general offer for all of the Shares not beneficially owned by the Funde Concert Group and the Shougang Concert Group, respectively.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden did something simultaneously clever and stupid recently in full view of TV cameras. He went bicycle riding with his wife, Jill, at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with no helmet.
 Smart because it's basically impossible for a 77-year-old man to look like anything but a total dork in a helmet – summoning for geezer Democrats the image of Michael Dukakis riding in a tank, the photo op blunder that may have settled the 1988 presidential election.
 Dumb because older cyclists are prone to dangerous, even deadly falls. Even fit and athletic ones like Biden. Without exception, every elderly bicycle enthusiast I know has made at least one emergency room visit – exactly why I gave up riding horses three years ago. You can't ride without falling, and when you're over 75, you can't fall without breaking something.
 Possibly your fool neck, my wife pointed out.
 But then try to imagine Boss Trump riding a bike. The guy can barely navigate a ramp in his corset and elevator shoes without looking like a cow on roller skates.
 However, the GOP strategy, often assisted by the pre-scripted political press, is to attack Joe Biden exactly where Trump is weakest. You can hardly read a newspaper story about the former vice president without encountering the word "gaffe" to signify Biden's occasional offbeat remarks.
 Well, how about if Biden were to announce that the "1917" Spanish Flu pandemic (1918, actually) brought "World War II" to an end? An event that took place, as every schoolboy not named Trump understands, in 1945.
 Or if it were credibly reported that Biden, like Trump, had no clue what significant military event took place at Pearl Harbor?
 What if he pronounced the name of a well-known national park as if addressing an audience of Jewish hipsters? "Yo, Semite."
 Or dubbed an Asian nation "Thigh Land"?
 Would those be gaffes?
 Also, what if Biden thought Finland was part of Russia? What if he'd gone on national TV and suggested that doctors inject coronavirus patients with Clorox and shine ultraviolet light up their wazoo?
 OK, enough. One could write a dozen columns with similar accounts of Boss Trump's blunders. In the real world, these things matter. Because somebody who can't find the Scandinavian countries (or Alabama) on a map doesn't know a whole lot of other things a president must know. There is no possibility of such an ignoramus handling the job successfully. None.
 So why am I reading an article in my local newspaper by a college professor asserting that Biden "must be kept in his basement lest he be exposed as too mentally feeble to carry out the duties of any public office, let alone the presidency"?
 "Slow Joe," the professor dubs him.
 Because that's basically all they've got. Certain of Bernie Sanders' more fervid supporters tried a similar gambit before the two candidates debated last March. They confidently predicted that Biden's verbal stumbles would undo him.
 Didn't happen. Indeed, Biden has always been an excellent debater. He all but made GOP whiz kid Paul Ryan cry during their 2012 vice-presidential confrontation. (Ryan's abilities were always overrated.) Almost everybody agreed that Biden won what boxing fans would call a split decision over Bernie.
 Sanders failed to win another Democratic primary.
 Writing in The Guardian, Art Cullen of the Storm Lake (Iowa) Times summarized: "Biden opened with a strong command of the coronavirus crisis and how to marshal the world to corral it. He was reassuring and confident in his fealty to science and facts. Voters crave it."
 Yes, he was. And yes, voters do.
 Recalling his hands-on experience during the Ebola and H1N1 health crises, Biden stressed the need to bring FEMA and the Pentagon on board to augment local hospitals. He emphasized the need for large-scale testing to isolate and contain viral outbreaks.
 "People are looking for results, not a revolution," he told Sanders. Above all, Biden urged swift government-wide action "to deal with the crisis now, so no one's thrown out of their home, no one loses their mortgage, no one is kicked out of their house, no one loses their paycheck, no one is in a position where they have a significant financial disability."
 Meanwhile, Trump was still boasting about the stock market and promising that COVID-19 would vanish with warmer weather. Reading the debate transcript, one can only lament how many more Americans would still be alive had Slow Joe, not Boss Trump, been in charge. Many thousands, for sure.
 So even as his campaign broadcasts doctored TV images of Biden supposedly hiding in his basement, Trump has a new line.
 "He's following the radical left agenda," he ranted recently. "Take away your guns. Destroy your Second Amendment. No religion! No anything! Hurt the Bible! Hurt God! He's against God! He's against guns!"
 Hurt God?
 You know, I think the old fool is losing it.

Investors have figured out just how dire their situations have become as some experts predict the virus will largely kill off large offices as more companies find they can operate with workers dispersed, saving on costly real estate.
 Even as the wider stock market has nearly recovered all of its losses from the early days of the outbreak, shares of Steelcase and Herman Miller remain deep in the red. Steelcase shares fell 69per cent from their 52-week high after the pandemic hit - and are still off 51per cent. Shares of Herman Miller fell over 71per cent and are still down over 50per cent.
 Herman Miller and others say they've made strides in expanding their online options since the pandemic hit and have found other ways to sell to individuals.
 Lori Gee, vice president of workplace performance services at the Zeeland, Michigan-based company, said they quickly set up a way for Google employees to buy directly from the company, for instance.
 "Part of this has been an acceleration of what we were already doing - to make it easier to get the best set up," regardless of where the furniture would go or the size of the order.
 HIGH PRICES, LOGISTICS CHALLENGES
 Manufacturers of many other goods have pivoted to new products, including things needed to fight the pandemic, or stepped up services to make up for other lost business.
 Office furniture makers have had a harder time, in large part because of logistical challenges. The average work-at-home customer, for instance, wants a product that can be sent by a delivery service in a single box and can be easily assembled - ideally without needing special tools.
 Price is also a factor. An Aeron chair, a classic design sold by Herman Miller, comes in versions that can easily cost US$1,000. Workstations in offices can cost even more, depending on their complexity and added features, such as adjustable desktops and built-in arms to hold computer monitors. Workers stuck at home are far less likely to splurge on such expensive options, at least in part because many are worried about keeping their jobs.
 The way big companies make their products is a complicating factor. Many producers have outsourced component production, buying bases from one company, for instance, desktops from another, and assembling them into configurations according to the design laid out for a large operation.
 "We're not used to dealing with the end user - if we get a call from a customer about a missing screw, we're not set up to handle that," said Soren Stig-Nielsen, president of LINAK U.S. Inc., the U.S. division of a Danish company that makes many of the world's actuators for lifting bases on desks to adjust height. The company has a large factory in Louisville, Kentucky, and sells its equipment to most of the big domestic furniture companies, including Steelcase.
 "COVID has created huge demand in the home office area," said Stig-Nielsen, "and traditionally we have not been a big player in that market."
 Meanwhile, the industry is not giving up on actual offices.
 Herman Miller's Gee said it is unclear how long the slump in building new centralized offices will continue. But she said the company's designers are already working on concepts for a new style of working, including more "small, satellite offices" that they believe companies will want to set up to serve workers more widely dispersed than in the past.
 "We think there will always be the need for a physical workplace - places where you go for collaboration and bring to life the corporate culture," Gee said.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Even the rental housing situation is seeing increases. Davis has a few rental units in the area and his recent listings brought responses like never before. Even 20-30 calls on one unit.
 “That to me is crazy,” Davis said. “I’ve been doing this for 10 years and I’ve never had that response from rentals.”
 Davis looks at this low inventory and sees it’s high time to introduce some new housing options in the area. The tough part is the cost of new construction makes that a difficult task. As Davis explains, it doesn’t matter what it costs to build a home, it’s what someone is willing to pay for it that determines the value.
 Things have changed a bit in this industry thanks to COVID-19. Masks are worn during tours and appraisals and wants and desires of those involved are taken into consideration.
 Hinkle explained how the realty business shutdown for a period when the stay- at-home order was in effect. He noted at least one seller took their home off the market just out of precaution as they were concerned about allowing extra people to file through their home. It’s a very uncertain time that these industry professionals are navigating in order to help people continue to find the place they can call home. As restrictions started loosening, the market began a rebound and is now very strong.
 “People wanted to get out and look at property,” Hinkle said. They’ve been getting out perhaps like never before.
 One area of concern coming from COVID-19 is that some drive-by appraisals are being allowed by the federal banks. It could be the homeowners choice to say they do not want anyone entering their home. In that case, many assumptions about the interior have to be made.
 “And I hate it,” Davis said.
 He wants to be able to do a careful appraisal to get the most accurate value. A lack of access to the home puts a stop to that important work. But the practice is an effort to avoid any transmission of the virus in a home.
 While there are some added inconveniences, there is no slow down in sight for this part of Wadena's business community.

Since the novel coronavirus was detected in China late last year, contact tracing has proven effective in reducing the spread of the illness in China, South Korea, Germany and other countries.
 “It’s a tried and true method that lowers spread of infectious diseases, and it would be useful for COVID-19 if it’s done right,” said Will Humble, a former director of the Arizona Department of Health Services who now heads the Arizona Public Health Association, which represents health workers and organizations.
 For contact tracing to be effective, the patient should be interviewed within 24 hours of testing positive, CDC guidelines say. After the patient identifies where he or she has been and the people with whom they’ve had contact, health officials attempt to reach each of those contacts.
 From there, the guidelines recommend, the tracer assigned to the case urges the contact to be tested and follows up every day to offer support services and make referrals to a medical provider if necessary. The exposed person, according to the CDC, should quarantine for 14 days, after which they no longer will be monitored.
 Gov. Doug Ducey on June 17 issued an executive order for the Department of Health Services to “implement a consistent, statewide system for case investigation and contact tracing.” It also authorized using National Guard personnel to trace contacts if needed and called for increased testing.
 The contact tracing efforts, introduced in July, are meant to “ensure county public health officers have the support, tools and resources to carry out robust contact tracing,” according to a news release from the governor’s office. Ducey’s office did not respond to Cronkite News’ requests for comment on this story.
 But The Arizona Republic reported June 26 that many patients who’d tested positive said they never received a phone call from public health workers in Maricopa County, nor did their contacts. Maricopa is the hardest-hit of Arizona’s 15 counties, with nearly 128,000 cases as of Aug. 13.
 Kyle Freese, chief epidemiologist for STCHealth in Phoenix, warned that the state needed to hire 4,000 contact tracers to avoid relying on already overburdened public health workers in a June 5 op-ed in The Arizona Republic. STCHealth has advised federal and international health officials in response to SARS, Hurricane Katrina and other major health events.
 But in a July op-ed published in the Phoenix Business Journal, Freese did not recommend more robust contract tracing because “prolonged wait times for test results and inadequate contact tracing efforts compound over time and directly contribute to exponential spread of the virus.”

My guess is that Paul and Matthew were building something like a stealth Geiger counter. Something that DOE agents could use without furtively hiding it. Something that looked innocuous, that played music, and functioned exactly like a normal iPod. You could walk around a city, casually listening to your tunes, while recording evidence of radioactivity—scanning for smuggled or stolen uranium, for instance, or evidence of a dirty bomb development program—with no chance that the press or public would get wind of what was happening. Like all other electronic gadgets, Geiger counters have gotten smaller and cheaper, and I was amused to run across the Radiation Alert Monitor 200, which looks an awful lot like a classic iPod.

Let’s take the leasing or finance application. As a prerequisite for a fully digital application, customers must identify and legitimize themselves online. Afterwards a credit check by the banking institution is mandatory. For that to work, Captives need to tackle their application process. Due to the nature of this process and the underlying steps, it is among the most time intensive and complex ones. However, an equally onerous process in the banking sector has been digitalized for years – opening a bank account. Thus, setting the example of how to streamline such a complex process. But when interviewing leasing experts, many told us, “the biggest obstacle within the application process is the online identification and legitimization of the customer.” Yet, for each challenge there is a solution. By now, IT companies offer specific products that take over the entire legitimization process. The good thing is that the entire solution can be integrated in the existing IT landscape via APIs. Even better – you kill two birds with one stone, as it is precisely these products that also enable the use of digital signatures to seal contracts online.
