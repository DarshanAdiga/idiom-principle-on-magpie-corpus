“It’s pretty crazy. It’s been shocking to say the least,” Combs said of his entertainer of the year nod, which comes two years after he was named new artist of the year. “You’re kind of up in the big leagues.”
 Carrie Underwood joins Combs and Lambert in the entertainer of the year category, along with Keith Urban and Eric Church. Garth Brooks, who won last year, recently announced he no longer wanted to be nominated for entertainer of the year because it was time for others to win.
 Combs’ nominations include album, single and male vocalist of the year. He’s nominated twice in the song of the year category for his own track, “Even Though I’m Leaving,” and for co-writing the Carly Pearce-Lee Brice duet “I Hope You’re Happy Now.”
 “It’s a dream come true for somebody that writes their own stuff,” said Combs. “Having won that award last year was just really really really special.”
 The CMA Awards will be held Nov. 11 in Nashville.

I don’t believe your moral compass would remain at True North if you had all these powers like they do in other (comics).”
 Amazon is betting that these complex superheroes will yield super ratings as the battle for original streaming content wages. Positioning itself as Prime’s flagship show, “The Boys” may have some help as the COVID-19 pandemic halted or delayed many previously scheduled productions. Season three has already been given the green light.

“There are very serious questions now that only the Russian government can answer, and must answer,” Merkel said, who described what happened to Navalny as “the attempted murder by poisoning of one of Russia’s leading opposition figures.”
 Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Aug 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.
 He was transferred two days later to Berlin’s Charité hospital, where doctors last week said initial tests indicated Navalny had been poisoned.
 British authorities identified Novichok as the poison used in 2018 on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. The nerve agent is a cholinesterase inhibitor, part of the class of substances that doctors at Charite said last week had shown up in Navalny’s system.
 German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the Russian ambassador was summoned to his ministry Wednesday and told in “unmistakable” terms of Germany’s call for the Navalny case to be investigated “in full and with full transparency.”
 “We now know that there was an attack with a chemical nerve agent,” Mass said. “That makes it even more urgent to determine who was responsible in Russia and to hold them to account.”
 The Kremlin remained tight-lipped and said it hadn’t been informed, even though its ambassador in Berlin had been summoned.
 The German government said it would inform its partners in the European Union and NATO about the test results. He said it wants to consult with them in light of the Russian response “on an appropriate joint response.” Germany also will contact the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

An 18-year-old Tyler man will serve 37 years in prison for the death of a Chapel Hill High School senior.
 John Edward Sparks Jr. pleaded guilty to murder on Wednesday for shooting Zane Collier, 17, in April. He then accepted a sentence of 37 years in the 241st District Court, according to online judicial records.
 At a virtual hearing broadcast through the court's YouTube channel, Sparks changed his plea from not guilty to guilty and also waived his right to a jury trial and appeal.
 An arrest affidavit states Sparks shot Collier because he stole marijuana from him.
 Collier was shot twice in his driveway in the 4800 block of Holiday Hills Road just after 3 a.m. April 2. He later died at a Tyler hospital.
 According to the affidavit, Collier and a friend bragged that they had stolen weed from a drug dealer, later identified as Sparks.
 One of the people at Collier’s residence told authorities Collier was shot when he went to his vehicle and that he was unresponsive when they found him, the affidavit states.
 According to the affidavit, Sparks told officers he was angry about his weed being stolen and fired the shots.
 During the investigation, Collier's friend took detectives to the mobile home he robbed. Officers located Sparks inside the home. During a police interview, Sparks was visibly upset when shown a photo of Collier. Sparks told officers after Collier and his friend took the weed, he went to the neighborhood where he thought Collier lived. Sparks found Collier and others smoking weed and "having a good time," according to the affidavit.
 Sparks told police he parked his car down the road and waited two hours for Collier to be alone. Sparks then pointed a handgun at Collier and told him to return his weed. He said Collier was frozen with fear and didn't react as the gun was pointed toward him. Sparks also tried to shoot Collier's friend, but he missed, the document stated.
 Collier had wounds in his left bicep and neck area. Smith County Sheriff’s Office deputies found three used shell casings near Collier’s body and vehicle.
 Sheriff’s office personnel located a firearm that Sparks said he used, according to the affidavit.
 Sparks will receive 154 days of jail credit after being in the Smith County Jail since April 2.
 When Collier died, Chapel Hill ISD Superintendent Lamond Dean said in a statement the district was saddened to hear about Collier’s death. He was going to turn 18 in May.
 “As a father, this is simply unimaginable and my heart goes out to Zane’s family,” Dean said. “When our school community experiences a tragedy, such as the loss of a young life, it impacts us all. This is difficult and challenging to process, and we realize that a tragic event such as this can generate high levels of anxiety and distress in students."
 "Our condolences, our thoughts, and our prayers go out to the Collier family and all of Zane’s friends,” he said. “I know that our entire community joins me in expressing condolences.”

Despite sometimes indulging in sour partisanship, Applebaum remains one of her profession’s rare talents, with a parallel claim to fame as a historian. Before earning a Pulitzer for her bestselling history of Stalin’s gulags, she drew in wide plaudits too for her expertly researched works on Ukraine’s Holomodor and the rise of the Iron Curtain in Central Europe. In a number of ways, she seemed predestined to just this kind of writing career. Her great- grandfather fled conscription in the 1880s under then-Russian emperor Alexander III. Her father is one of big law’s star attorneys on matters of antitrust and trade. And, while her mother curated Washington D.C.’s Corcoran Gallery, the young Anne read history and literature at Yale, attending Wolfgang Leonhard’s famous course on Soviet history, visiting her forefathers’ Belarus in 1985, and eventually crossing the pond as a post-grad Marshall scholar at the LSE. This distinguished career has acquainted Applebaum with the frontiers between the Old and New Worlds, between our fragile democracies and the dark alternatives to them.

“That hurricane hit the Baja Peninsula pretty hard before it turned into a tropical storm,” Desmet said, referring to Hurricane Genevieve. “It eventually moved over Nevada on its way to Idaho.”
 Heavy precipitation from the southwest is common in August, Desmet said, as Idaho temperatures cool heading into fall. However, the intensity of the hurricane, combined with the high-pressure system that’s been sitting over the state breaking slightly, created the perfect conditions for heavy rainfall, according to Desmet.
 “The strong, high pressure system created a wall, kind of,” he said. Once the wall broke, the cold, low-pressure system moved in, bringing large raindrops and strong winds.
 The forecast calls for another round of high heat, Desmet said. After a spatter of precipitation early this week, he said Challis residents should expect a dry period lasting through the weekend.

Comparable store sales increased 12.6% year over year.      Markedly e-commerce sales skyrocketed 332% on the back of high double-digit conversion rates. E-commerce sales contributed more than 20% to total sales in the second quarter compared with less than 6% in the year-ago quarter.      However, brick-and-mortar sales were adversely impacted by COVID-19 related store closures (in early second quarter) and delays in back-to-school shopping (in late second quarter).      Moving on, gross profit margin contracted 310 basis points (bps) to 27.5%. Merchandise margins went down 370 bps, as a percentage of net sales, owing to higher e-commerce shipping costs and increase in adult athletic sales that carry lower margins than non-athletic products. Buying distribution and occupancy costs declined 60 bps, due to leveraging impact from higher sales.      SG&A expenses increased $1.8 million during the reported quarter to $68.2 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses contracted 210 bps to 22.7%.

I can’t remember where I first heard it, but for years I believed a fairytale.
 You see, Women in the American West were largely the first to get voting rights. That part is true, an undisputed fact.
 In Wyoming alone, women have been voting -- and enjoying full political equality, even -- since 1870, 20 years before the territory achieved statehood and 50 years before the 19th Amendment was ratified on Aug. 18, 1920.
 After a number of other Western territorial legislatures followed, granting women in the Utah, Washington and Montana territories the right to vote in the late 19th century, Colorado became the first state to do so by public referendum in 1893.
 But -- and here's the fairytale -- I was told, somewhere along the line, that this was because of merit. I was led to believe that rugged, capable pioneer women of the American West were so respected they were given the right to vote in a move toward equality.
 "That's cute," University of Wyoming history professor Renee Laegreid said when I relayed this nugget of passed-down history to her one afternoon in late July. "I just don't see a lot of evidence for that."
 "There are a lot of arguments for why suffrage occurred (in the West)," Laegreid clarified.
 On one hand, there was a race among the Western territories to make history by being the first to give women voting rights. On the other, some men in the West -- many of whom had fled the post-Civil War South -- warmed to the idea of women's suffrage in at attempt to keep their white voting majority as the adoption of the 15th Amendment, giving men of color the right to vote, neared.
 "Maybe there was an idea that since women were out in the fields they deserved equality. Maybe for some that was a factor, because it was not just one thing that got people to jump on the suffrage bandwagon," she said. "But, really, it gets more to the politics of the era, this idea of, 'Where do women belong?' And really, now, we're still arguing about that."
 As we celebrate a century of women's suffrage this year -- mooning over black- and-white photos of suffragists parading down packed city streets in their "Votes For Women" sashes -- my mind goes, instead, to the dusty pioneer towns and vast swaths of plains and prairies of the American West.
 It was there, after all, that many American women first earned the right to vote.

On Monday, Trump held a news conference. Asked to condemn the killings in Kenosha, he said the shooter acted in self-defense; otherwise, “he probably would have been killed.” Asked to condemn the Portland caravan for harassment, he refused. (Over the weekend, on Twitter, he called them “GREAT PATRIOTS!”) Trump said nothing, in other words, to disprove Biden’s claim that he “looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline” and that he “adds fuel to every fire.”
 It’s not too late. With a little more than two months until the election, the president can still reverse course. But he cannot do so as long as he and his campaign indulge the fantasy that he is blameless and untouched by the crisis in “Democrat cities.”
 The solution is for Trump to disavow the instigators. His trip to Kenosha on Tuesday should include tough words for police officers who insist on using lethal force when it’s not necessary. He should urge police departments to reject the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and military-style equipment against protesters, understanding, as the Kerner Commission report explained in 1968, that “the harmful effects of overreaction are incalculable.”
 Face to face with law enforcement at the site of a terrible tragedy, Trump will have the chance to rebuke both bad policing and the self-styled militias who raised the heat on an already tense situation.

“Democratic mayors don’t govern as Democrats for the most part,” said Elisabeth Gerber, a political scientist at the University of Michigan.
 About 85% of all cities have nominally nonpartisan elections, in which candidates’ party affiliations never appear on the ballot (researchers, however, have ways of sussing out partisanship nonetheless). And in some cities that do have partisan elections, the leading candidates may all be Democrats, making their partisan identities unimportant. Party is less relevant, anyway, to local races that may turn on who can clear the snow fastest, or negotiate with the teachers’ union effectively, or build the most affordable housing.
 “Partisanship isn’t the story either in electoral politics, or in position- taking, or in messaging,” Gerber said. “It’s not like they’re running _as_ Democrats.”
 Cities have been faced with problems far beyond their making. Deindustrialization and globalization wiped out many middle-class factory jobs, destabilizing neighborhoods of blue-collar workers. The federal policy of highway construction enabled both taxpayers and employers to leave cities. Federal housing policies dissuaded or prevented Black residents initially from joining them, cementing patterns of racial and economic segregation that persist to this day.
 The coronavirus pandemic offers another example. Gerber and colleagues found that nearly half of Detroit’s labor force was unemployed at the worst moment of the pandemic this summer, as lower-wage workers were hit hardest by the economic crisis and Black residents were hit hardest by the virus. That pattern isn’t Mayor Mike Duggan’s fault, Gerber said.
 As cities have confronted these problems over decades, Republicans in Washington have cut funding to cities and programs they relied on.
 “Republican administrations have really decided that cities should be left to market forces,” said Marion Orr, a professor of political science and urban studies at Brown University. “And those cities who can survive those market forces are worthy of survival, and those who cannot really find themselves struggling.”

Rubio, a Democrat, is that rare bird in either party, a genuine moderate, pro- business without being hard-hearted.

Column: No reason to not have life-jackets on board


--DocBreak--
A federal judge this week ruled that Initiative 1639 — a host of firearms regulations approved by Washington state voters in 2018 — is constitutional.
 And while we disagree, it’s U.S. District Court of Western Washington Judge Ronald Leighton’s words that hold the weight of law. When he says I-1639 is a constitutional law, it is — at least for now.
 Leighton’s ruling will certainly be appealed, and the final verdict is likely to come from the U. S. Supreme Court.
 But until then, I-1639 is the law and must be followed.
 To this point, some sheriffs in Washington counties contend they won’t enforce the law because, in their opinion, they believe it is unconstitutional. Again, their opinion — like ours — isn’t legally binding. Leighton’s is.
 Leighton said in his ruling that current federal law banning the sale of handguns to people under 21, as well as state laws going back to the 19th century, have imposed age restrictions on weapon purchases.
 “These authorities demonstrate that reasonable age restrictions on the sale, possession, or use of firearms have an established history in this country,” Leighton wrote in the order. “The extension of Washington’s age restrictions” for semi-automatic rifles “is ultimately a distinction without a difference.”
 In a statement Monday, state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said he was “confident that Washington law enforcement officials will carefully review this ruling from a Bush-appointed federal judge upholding the constitutionality of I-1639.” He expects all to enforce the law.
 Adding, “Enhanced background checks will save lives, and the duty to perform these checks is not discretionary.”
 Still, we have opposed I-1639 and urged voters to reject it. However, about 60% of voters statewide approved it.
 Our objection was that the scope of the ballot measure was simply too broad. Initiatives are generally a lousy way to write laws. The ballot proposals are written specifically to represent a single point of view. There is no give- and-take of the legislative process. And, as a result, flaws are often discovered once it becomes the law.
 Beyond that, the way in which the signatures were collected to put the measure on the ballot was seriously flawed.
 State law requires a “readable, full, true, and correct” description of the measure to be printed on the reverse side of the petition, and the text of the I-1639 petition sheets lacked underlining and strikethroughs to explain its changes to existing law. That did not occur. The size of the print describing the intent of the initiative was too tiny to be read, and so, too, was the way the proposed changes were not clearly marked.
 This, in our view, could be enough to invalidate I-1639.
 Whether a higher court agrees is another matter.
 But until a final resolution to appeals comes to fruition, we agree with Ferguson. The voter-approved law must be followed.

--DocBreak--
Based off the comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson from which the show also derives its names, the series follows The Boys, a small group of mercenaries, as they chase a popular and famous ensemble of A-list superheroes called The Seven. The Boys, headed by Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) and Alonso are threaded together by their individual vendettas against the “heroes,” but these aren’t the usual squeaky-clean icons found from Marvel or DC Comics.
 This (very) gory, not-for-kids action show features the superheroes, known as “supes,” as they chase glory often by immoral—and many times illegal—choices. Vought, a powerful and influential company led by CEO Stan Edgar (Giancarlo Esposito) is in full control of their images, marketing them to the public while hiding their dirty deeds. It was revealed that a formula called Compound V is what gives these heroes their powers.
 The Seven comprises an extremely diverse set of characters — some from source material, others altered by Kripke — of different ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations and political ideologies. Not following the typical good versus evil plots, Kripke’s deeper dives this season include today’s issues of systemic racism and capitalism.
 “(In) episode four, there’s an African American teen who gets pulled over by a superhero and it goes poorly,” Kripke said. “I do get asked that question of do we have a crystal ball? And my response is like these were issues a year ago, five years ago, 10 years ago, 50 years ago. (They) just happened to be in the front of people’s minds now.”
 “It’s really cool to explore very, very real issues from this slightly heightened and sometimes not-so-heightened from reality place,” Quaid said. “We don’t have to pretend that the world’s not on fire for our show.”
 Last season featured a #MeToo-Time’s Up storyline as new Seven member Starlight (Erin Moriarty) was coerced into a sexual act with veteran colleague The Deep (Chase Crawford). Starlight revealed her assault on live TV, prompting The Deep’s exile.
 “The world is kind of feeding us a lot of content,” said Moriarty whose character’s romantic relationship with Quaid’s character is a major storyline. “I just feel kind of lucky to be on a show that is of the zeitgeist, frankly, because I don’t like to pretend that the world is in an OK place, which it especially isn’t now more than ever.”
 The first season juxtaposed the concept of celebrity and power with morality while also tackling fascism and corrupt politics. Some of those themes continue this season as The Boys are on the run after being blamed for the murder of Madelyn Stillwell, the Vought vice president, although the culprit was actually Seven leader Homelander (Antony Starr).

Simply put, most gamers just want to play video games and be left alone. If religion was once the opiate of the masses, then entertainment—gaming being one of the most ubiquitous forms of it—has to be its newest incarnation since the decline of Christianity in the West. Tampering with the formula is the best way to awaken those otherwise asleep to the reality of politics in 2020. That’s why controversies like “GamerGate” are events I’d consider a _red pill_ for the politically unaware. It’s best to let sleeping dogs lie, but social justice agitators just can’t help themselves.

Unlike some other reality franchises, _Big Brother _knows that all-stars seasons should be special events. That's why when it was announced that Season 22 would be _Big Brother_ 's second ever all-stars edition, coming 14 years after the first in Season 7, fans were galvanized by the hope that this would secure us a truly great season of _Big Brother_. Unfortunately, almost right away it became clear that these hopes would likely not be fulfilled. We're only four weeks into the 13-week game, and wishing for greatness already feels largely like a lost cause. I'll keep watching, of course, and even keep alive a small hope that things will improve, but _Big Brother 22_ 's fate as a big disappointment feels like it may already have been sealed.
 For one, not everyone playing is an all-star. When the cast was confirmed during the season premiere, there were a few names that immediately stood out as legendary game players, like Janelle Pierzina, Kaysar Ridha, Dani Briones, and Ian Terry, and beloved houseguests like Da'Vonne Rogers. But while we could understand why a few people were included even if they weren't necessarily standout players — after what superfan Nicole Anthony went through last season, she definitely earned a second shot — others seemed more random.
