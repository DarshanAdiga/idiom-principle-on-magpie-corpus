Abington Heights will not participate in contact sports this fall, including football, because of COVID-19 health concerns.
 Following a school board meeting in which he was unanimously granted the authority to do so, school district superintendent Michael Mahon, Ph.D. told The Times-Tribune he is canceling football, boys and girls soccer, field hockey, girls volleyball and cheerleading, effective immediately, while allowing golf and girls tennis, and possibly cross country to compete under strict guidelines.
 “This is absolutely horrible and I do have a sense of it,” said Mahon, who served as an assistant football coach at Scranton Prep for 10 seasons. “I also played high school football, and I missed a year with a dislocated shoulder and another with an injured ankle. But these kids are having it ripped away from them through no fault of their own. But, in the situation we are in, it is necessary.
 “I respect people and families who are upset, but from the chair I sit in it’s the only thing to do.”
 Mahon cited a factor in the decision to cancel, which he called “heartbreaking,” was that in order to allow students to participate in contact fall sports it would force the suspension of any social distancing for the time of the activity, which would put the athletes at risk.
 After having the end of the winter sports season and the entire spring sports season canceled, athletic programs in the state were given permission in June to start voluntary workouts once an area had reached the Green phase of Gov. Tom Wolf’s reopening guidelines and each school implemented strict safety protocols.
 Fall sports programs at Abington Heights were suspended by Mahon on July 31, but not canceled as the administration reviewed future conditions.
 Valley View, Carbondale Area and Forest City have also suspended sports activities indefinitely with decisions about their futures pending this week.
 On Friday, the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association is expected to make an announcement regarding the status of the fall sports season, which is on pause, in the state. If the PIAA moves ahead, the first official day for fall practice is Monday.
 Golf and girls tennis at Abington Heights can move forward with coaches enforcing plans to make sure maximum social distancing can occur, and cross country could continue under special circumstances. Those would include a runner from Abington Heights going off on a staggered start with an assurance that the runner could not catch the runner in front to threaten the social distance guideline.
