I WISH WE HAD TRAVELED MORE WHILE WE COULD'
 All too often, health issues derail people's travel plans, says certified financial planner Serina Shyu of Atlanta. They don't get around to taking that dream trip, or get to see as many places as they'd hoped. Even homebodies regret missed chances to see loved ones.
 "Another version is where the health issue isn't (the retiree's). 'I wish we had gone to see so-and-so,'" says CFP Daniel B. Moisand of Melbourne, Florida. "Sometimes we wait to reconnect with friends or family and that person dies or suffers a stroke or dementia."
 Financial planners can help people get clarity about how much money they can safely spend in retirement. CFP Linda Y. Leitz of Colorado Springs, Colorado, says she's been able to reassure several clients so they could get started on their bucket lists.
 "As they aged and either had health concerns or just didn't enjoy being away from home as much, they all were really glad that they traveled," Leitz says. "They don't mind cutting back in later years because they had done the things that were important to them, early in retirement, while they could enjoy them."
 'I WISH I'D HAD SOMETHING TO RETIRE TO'
 People can be so tired of working, or sick of their particular job, that they retire at the first opportunity without thinking through how they will spend their time. Many struggle to replace the structure, meaning and purpose their work provided.
 "They look back five or six years after they have retired to realize the time has flown by and they have not done anything," says CFP Jonathan P. Bednar of Knoxville, Tennessee.
 CFP Jennifer Weber of Lake Success, New York, counsels her clients to think about "how to spend their days with meaning." That could mean a part-time job, consulting gigs, volunteering or spending more time with friends and family, she says.
 'I WISH I HAD MORE FRIENDS'
 Something else work provides: social contact. People often don't realize how much social interaction their workplace provides, says CFP Patti B. Black of Birmingham, Alabama. Black recommends volunteer groups, clubs and classes as potential sources of new friends.
 "People may feel 'out of the loop' in retirement," Black says. "It takes time and effort to find a new tribe."
 'I WISH WE HADN'T BOUGHT THAT HOUSE'
 CFP Kevin M. O'Brien of Northborough, Massachusetts, says some of his clients' retirement home purchases triggered serious buyer's remorse. The clients hadn't spent enough time in the community before buying, and now wish they lived somewhere else.
 The cost and stress of changing homes is usually significant. Although moving may be the right choice, no one should buy a retirement home in haste, O'Brien says.
 "Retirees should rent in areas they're interested in retiring to before making a major purchase," O'Brien says.

Courrielche explained, "In a nutshell, we recorded a White House conference call where the Obama administration tried to use a federal arts agency -- the NEA -- to create propaganda, all to sell the American people on Obamacare. … The NEA story [was when] we caught the Obama administration trying to turn the National Endowment of the Arts into a propaganda machine. … They encouraged us to create art on health care, on energy and the environment, and they wanted us to bring whatever art network [or] talent that we had to those issues. At the time, some experts claimed that the effort might have violated a law prohibiting federal funds for being used for political activities.”

Rangers striker Jason Cummings started the game ahead of Premiership top scorer Alfredo Morelos
 The visiting support appeared increasingly restless as Ryan Edwards latched on to Sammon's flick and hit the net, only to be flagged offside, although Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald was adamant his player was onside.
 That frustration turned to elation when Rangers produced a goal of stunning quality. Candeias was at the heart of it with a neat flick which Jason Cummings redirected down the line back into his path.
 The Portuguese winger didn't hesitate, slotting a first-time ball across for Windass to finish with confidence. It was a brilliant move that ripped Thistle to shreds in a matter of seconds and delivered the platform for this win.
 Thistle could take heart from their performance to that point and they almost equalised just before half time. Sammon picked up inside the box and fired a low shot across Foderingham that struck the inside of the post.

But after getting nearly everything he wanted during his first legislative session, he might find this year's to be a little tougher, with concerns about his teacher raise proposal and reluctance to pass E-verify. The legislative session begins on Tuesday.
 House Speaker Jose Oliva and Senate President Bill Galvano, both Republicans, have expressed concerns about DeSantis's proposal to raise the minimum teacher pay statewide, which would cost about $600 million.
 While Galvano said raising teacher salaries is a worthy goal, taking a blanket approach to a state as large and diverse as Florida may not be easy.
 "There are districts that have different levels of pay currently, you have different costs of living in certain districts, and when you go through and put it as a one-size-fits-all, then you can create some practical problems as well as some inequities," Galvano said.
 House Democratic Leader Kionne McGhee agrees with DeSantis that teachers need raises across the board, but he thinks the state should go beyond the governor's proposal.
 "Right now the thing I can agree with him on, is this is the year for the teacher," McGhee said.
