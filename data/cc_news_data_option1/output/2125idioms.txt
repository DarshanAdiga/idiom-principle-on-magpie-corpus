Howard Nevin Peters passed away at home on May 28, 2020. Howard was born on June 29, 1938 in Hazleton, PA to Dr.Howard Eugene and Verna Catherine (Miller) Peters, who preceded him in death. He was also preceded in death by his brother, Norman Eugene Peters. On August 24, 1963 in Yonkers NY he married his life's companion Judith (Griessel) Peters. Together they raised two loving children, Nevin Edward (wife MaryBeth Milas) Peters and Elisabeth Anne Peters Prescott (husband Courtney).      Howard graduated from Hazleton High School and earned his B.A. at Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA. He received a National Defence Education Act Fellowship for graduate study at the University of Colorado, Boulder where he earned a Ph.D in Comparative Literature.      In 1965 Howard and Judith moved to Valparaiso IN. to teach at Valparaiso University. Howard taught Spanish language and literature, creating unique ways for his students to grasp the ins and outs of Spanish grammar, and inspiring them to delve deeply into Spanish literature. During his time at VU Howard served in various administrative positions, including Director of the Graduate Division and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, before returning to his first love, the classroom, where he completed his thirty years of dedication to VU.      Howard's area of research and publication was Spanish drama, which took him frequently to Spain, which became like a second home. He travelled there extensively, just recently completing his dream of journeying bit by bit around the entire periphery of the country. His book of philosophical poetry, "Espejo de Son" ("Mirror of Sound") was published in Madrid in 1997.      Howard loved to sing, and his beautiful tenor voice graced his high school quartet, the Gettysburg College Choir, and for many years the choir of Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Chesterton, where he was a long-time member.      Watching baseball was a favorite pastime, and Howard was a life-long dedicated Pittsburgh Pirates fan through thick and thin (mostly thin). He loved to work outdoors on his property, trimming, mowing, digging, planting, and then relaxing and enjoying the view. But no enjoyment compared with time spent with his two special grandchildren, Miller and Augusten Peters, playing baseball, going on expeditions, and working together in the yard. He also gave thanks daily for his two devoted children, Elisabeth and Nevin.      Together Howard and Judith enjoyed travelling, and were privileged to visit many countries in Europe, Africa and Latin American, as well as exploring many of the wonders of the USA.      Howard's smile could, and did, brighten anyone's day and he will be sorely missed by fellow church members, colleagues, friends near and far, and by his family.      A private family burial service will be held, and, at a future date, a celebration of life service. Memorials may be made to Bethlehem Lutheran Church, 2050W 1100N, Chesterton IN 46304 or to Kids Alive International, 2507 Cumberland Drive, PO Box 2117, Valparaiso IN 46384.      Professional arrangements are entrusted to the White-Love Funeral Home, Chesterton, IN. Memories may be shared at: www.whitelovefuneralhome.com.

Provisionally titled In Bed with the Blueshirts, the book is likely to be a much- anticipated publication given Mr Ross’ many and well-publicised rows with Mr Kenny and Fine Gael.
 Mr Ross and Mr Kenny came to blows consistently in the early days and were not helped by Mr Ross’ description of the then acting-taoiseach as a “political corpse” during talks in 2016.
 Mr Ross, who lost his Dublin-Rathdown seat in the February general election, remains an acting minister until a new government is formed and is no stranger to controversy.
 Sources close to the project have confirmed that the book will seek to tell the inside story, warts and all, of life in government with Mr Kenny and Mr Varadkar as part of the now-defunct Independent Alliance.
 “It will deal with how friend became foe, and foe became friend overnight. The unknown battles, the honour and the treachery, the rows and the reconciliations will all feature,” one source told the Irish Examiner.

Open interest and volume in Natural Gas futures markets rose by around 19K contracts and by almost 97K contracts, respectively, on Friday, according to flash figures from CME Group. Natural Gas Prices Forecast Friday's small advance in prices of the commodity was in tandem of rising open interest and volume, which could be supportive of a near-term rebound. In fact, Natural Gas continues to navigate the lower bound of the recent range and at shouting distance from May's lows near the $1.80 level per MMBtu. The potential rebound, however, carries the potential to extend to the key barrier at $2.00, although a stronger catalyst is needed to extend the move further north on a sustainable fashion.

Plunging fleet sales are among the reasons forecasters expect total U.S. sales this year to be about 20 percent lower than the 17.1 million sold in 2019. J.D. Power is forecasting 2020 sales of 13 million to 14.4 million vehicles, down from a pre-virus baseline of 16.8 million.
 However, retail demand has been on the rebound since early April. LMC upped its 2020 forecast to 13.3 million vehicles from 12.9 million because the market has performed better than expected in April and May.
 The full-year outlook does face some risks, said Jeff Schuster, president of LMC's Americas operation and global vehicle forecasts, if production is further hampered by parts shortages or frequent plant shutdowns because of sick workers. He said the industry could get back to 16 million vehicle sales by 2022.
 LMC expects retail sales to be down about 20 percent in May. "Fleet, on the other hand, is another story," said Schuster, who projects a 65 to 70 percent decline in the fleet market. "We're seeing a pretty significant drop."

Next, it's important to consider that office density needs are interrelated to the facility architecture. It is possible to accommodate a higher capacity of workforce in an airy, open office space than in a constrained one. A good rule of thumb is to start by introducing no more than 30% of employees back into the workplace at first. This could be a rolling group model in which the population total remains controlled and constant, but specific individuals vary from day to day. This option is good for a workforce that needs to be together in person but not necessarily all at the same time due to office density concerns.

Philip S. Kline Jr., a physician who practiced radiology for over 30 years in San Antonio, died Saturday following a long battle against dementia. He was 77.Dr. Kline was born in Chicago to Dr. Philip Kline Sr., Surgeon, and Lois Bates Kline on September 30, 1942.After obtaining his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin, he followed the family tradition of practicing medicine and attended George Washington University where he received his medical degree. He completed his residency in radiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. After two years as an Army major, stationed in Denver, he returned to San Antonio in 1978 where he began a long career as a devoted physician. A beloved figure in the hospital, his gregarious demeanor enamored him to staff, nurses and fellow physicians alike.Socially active, Dr. Kline and his wife Deborah were members of the San Antonio Country Club, The Argyle, and the wine tasting club Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin.From an early age, Dr. Kline was an enthusiastic athlete. He was named to the All-State and All-American aquatic teams while at Keystone High School. His aquatic career continued at the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of the diving and swim teams.In 1961, Dr. Kline brushed against history when he was invited to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's ranch. The occasion was a foreign visit by the Pakistani president and LBJ, as part of a large Bar-B-Que he hosted, wanted to show off with Texas flare. In addition to other forms of entertainment, the event requested the University of Texas' newly minted All-Conference diving champions to perform an exhibition at the ranch's pool. After determining LBJ's diving board was too brittle to support their spring, Dr. Kline had the University's board installed to fulfill the request. He described participating in the event as his "proudest moment."If by a pool in later years, he liked to delight friends and family by approaching the diving board and casually executing front one- and-a-half pike dives.Dr. Kline also became a serious runner and marathoner. He formed the San Antonio Marathon Clinic where he helped beginner runners complete their first marathon. He invited guest lecturers to educate runners on diet, health and marathon training techniques. The clinic's own materials were punctuated with Dr. Kline's encouraging advice throughout: "If it's not fun, you're not doing it right," and, "Don't let anyone try to humiliate or harass you out of your body's comfortable pace." He mixed business and pleasure by joining the American Medical Athletic Association.Dr. Kline would run over 30 marathons himself, the Paris and Honolulu races being his favorites. With his longtime friend Dr. Jim White, he participated in multi- day 100-mile races such as the Trans Sierra Ultra Run and the Great Hawaiian Footrace. For Dr. White's 50th birthday, they celebrated by running the 50 miles from Kerrville to San Antonio in a single day. When he retired from marathoning, his "gold standard" was to run 10 miles a day, a habit he continued until late in life.In addition to his professional and athletic pursuits, Dr. Kline was a true renaissance man in every sense of the word. He shared his love of history, music, wine, travel, and learning with friends and family.With his friend Vito Aguilar, he helped design the functionally and aesthetically pleasing wine cellars that would become the center of attention in his homes. Despite the constant 58-degree temperature, they were places that guests liked to congregate. In a San Antonio Express News profile of the wine cellar, his wife Deborah commented, "If people come here to the house, they all end up in this place. I'll be out in the living room…but they all stay here."Imbibing wasn't its only function, as Dr. Kline mentioned, "I've brought the kids in here and made them study…I'll say, 'Put on your coat. We're going into the wine cellar'" where there are no interruptions.Dr. Kline became an accomplished jazz pianist whose hero was Dave Brubeck. As an adult he took weekly piano lessons with Nobuko and then Valery Grokhovski. Dr. Kline's rendition of Brubeck's "The Duke" and "Take the 'A' Train" regularly filled the home.Eventually he and his wife would host parties where his friends, and often his brother Peter on the drums, would perform jazz standards to provide the night's entertainment. These "piano parties" were what he enjoyed most. During the annual King William Fair, Dr. Kline would host public jazz shows on his front lawn.Later in life, his curiosity led him to passionately study the French and Portuguese languages. Traveling frequently to Europe for his beloved biking trips or his wife's native Brazil, he created many opportunities to put his learnings to practice.Dr. Kline's four children fondly remember traveling with dad to Hawaii to surf, Colorado to ski and France to bike. His influence on them is great. His eldest son, Philip III, has been a lifelong athlete, including a roster spot on the Texas Longhorns football team. Chris became a professional musician with a large repertoire of instruments that include the piano. Eric inherited his father's epicurean taste and interest in travel, reading history and writing. Andrea, Dr. Kline's only daughter, followed in his footsteps and became a physician.As Dr. Kline's health declined, he continued to enjoy the activities that made him the man he had become. He continued to prefer being surrounded by good food, wine, music and company. Most of all, his genial personality never abandoned him.Dr. Kline is survived by his wife Deborah; brothers, Peter Brice Kline and his wife Ester, and Timothy Newcomb Kline; his sons Philip Sherwood Kline III and his wife Kelly, Christopher Brice Kline and his wife Micci, Eric Sherwood Kline and daughter Drs.

Last week, in announcing Nissan's worst net loss since Ghosn's first year at the company in 1999, CEO Makoto Uchida said a drastic restructuring is needed to set the company back on a profit path after years of expanding too fast into too many markets in the pursuit of lofty sales volumes."To continue our business and generate a profit under these conditions has been extremely difficult," Uchida said, adding that executives would take various compensation cuts in light of the losses. "For Nissan to overcome this situation, we must admit our mistakes and correct course."
 Ghosn had wanted Infiniti to account for 10 percent of the world's luxury market and rack up annual sales of 500,000 vehicles. Instead, Infiniti's global volume peaked at 249,000 vehicles in 2018, before dropping 24 percent to 188,994 last year.
 Global sales shortfalls left Nissan Motor overstretched and strapped for resources to renew the lineups. In the end, both the Nissan and Infiniti brands were often left flogging outdated vehicles with outdated technology.
 As part of Ghosn's grand vision to establish a global megamanufacturer, he brought Daimler into the Renault-Nissan orbit through a 2010 deal with then- Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche. Daimler took 3.1 percent stakes in Nissan and Renault. The two alliance companies took 1.55 percent stakes each in their new German partner.

Farrell is as busy as he would be any other summer preparing for the new season – whenever that may be – without being able to get any signings over the line.
 The club have furloughed a group of players until the end of this month, after which they will be starting from scratch a few weeks before when the Betfred Cup was due to begin.
 Farrell said: “It’s surreal. I am speaking to players. I still need to do due diligence and it’s not like I can just relax because of the situation we are in.
 “It’s the final piece of the jigsaw that’s the problem – the contractual piece they are looking to gauge against other clubs. We don’t know what division we’ll be in. We don’t have our budget yet. Normally we’d have the existing players agreed then be well down the road looking to sign players.

Last season was the worst the club experienced so far, falling to seventh in the table as defending champions before Covid-19 cut the season short.
 There's been two failed play-off attempts along the way, so asked what he thinks it will take for them to go the extra mile next season, he said: "Last year the teams above East Kilbride all got off to a good start and you need to do that.
 "If you don't get off to a good start in this league, no matter what you have in your squad, you are chasing your tail.
