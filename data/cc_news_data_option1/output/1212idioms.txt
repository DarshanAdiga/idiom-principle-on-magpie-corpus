Yes. I have to say, depending on the day -- the volume could be down depending on the day. But part of the problem is we don't understand, which percentage of the population we are testing were acute versus how many had chronic pain. So, the acute patients probably are getting the blood test versus chronic pain. Maybe they're dealing with it and it's going to be volume, in the future. Also, we don't understand what percentages of the specimens are collected via annual exam. So, it's some of the -- we're still early in this. So, I don't want to make any conclusions just yet, but I'd say that our test is a little bit different than annual exams, screening test. But we do know in certain areas of the country too that elective surgeries are being delayed. So, I think time will tell and we'll get more information. But going into COVID, we were very pleased and even coming out of COVID and a week into COVID, we're sort of in a watch and see mode.

Once you have your honest answers, you're ready to invest in high-quality items that you can wear over and over again. Try to purchase quality items that stand the test of time. Rather than buying four or five similar shirts, none of which fit quite right, you should invest in one quality shirt that fits like a glove. Your personal inventory will help you choose what you want your clothes to accentuate about your body and decide which silhouettes will do the trick. This eliminates frivolous and duplicate purchases you will never wear and acts as a great guide for creating a capsule wardrobe.

We were all caught off guard at the speed of events over the last two weeks. Toilet paper flew off shelves, and then, the next day, there were 2,000 confirmed cases nationwide.
 That’s when the churches started canceling, and then it was 3,000. Schools shut down — 6,000 cases. And then the bars and restaurants shuttered, as COVID-19 crept closer — Watauga County, Lincoln, Catawba — 40,000 cases!
 Our national conversation these days is dominated by concepts we hardly gave a passing thought to just a few weeks ago. It’s easy to get caught up in the madness, and in many ways, it’s responsible. In times like these, we must stay informed and take every possible precaution, but it’s also important to sit back for a moment and take stock of where we are right now.

“It’s nice to be able to check that box off.”
 Smith said the fact that BCSO reached out to him sealed the deal on him wanting to help in this way.
 “I’ve got a new still being built, and the guy who’s building the still called me up and said, ‘I’ve got the sheriff’s department here,’ and I was like, ‘Oh no, my new still’s going to be confiscated.’ But they were looking for hand sanitizer, and he told them to get in touch with me,” Smith said.
 “That’s what really started the whole process. I wanted to, and they contacted me, reinforcing it. It made it hit home, what was going on and the urgency for it. Now that there’s two cases in Burke County, I’m ready to ramp it up and help fight this thing as best we can.”
 Smith said he wants to next supply his hand sanitizer to the local hospital, which is sending a 30-gallon drum to be filled. He’s fielded calls from the U.S. Postal Service in Greensboro and Charlotte, as well, but he has a list of local medical providers and emergency services personnel he wants to get to first, then he wants to offer the product to the public, if possible.
 “I would love to be able to provide it to the public at this time, but I can’t. I’ve got to get these other emergency services personnel and fire departments taken care of in the beginning, give them some supply and get them stocked with a little something. Then, maintain during this crisis. Hopefully we’ll be able to get the public in there because I’ve heard some sad stories of people with medical conditions and such.
 “With what I looked at last night, there’s just a handful of distilleries in North Carolina doing this. But if everybody pitched in, it could help relieve some of people’s fear because they’re accustomed to having something. And when they don’t have it, it kind of puts them in a panic mode, like the toilet paper. This can help ease somebody’s mind a little bit. Put them a little at ease in a serious time.”
 He’s asking people who want to help to donate containers for the hand sanitizer or money to help cover the cost of ingredients.
 “We’re going to keep donating, but we’re going to have to recoup some material cost at some point. We’re asking for donations for some of this. But we’re not really trying to make a profit off of it.
 “The profit is getting this under control.”

Fast-forward to my third year in college, when I hit rock bottom. I had developed an eating disorder in high school, and although I tried to convince myself that I had moved past it, that couldn't have been further from the truth. On the inside, I was devastated—devastated that I was wasting what could be some of the best years of my life and even more so frustrated with myself because I couldn’t figure out how to shake the control food had over me.
 On top of it all, I was too embarrassed to get help. Fatefully and unforgettably, that’s when yoga found _me_.

RALEIGH — The precise course of the COVID-19 outbreak and its medical, social and even political consequences are impossible to know at this writing. But there is at least one thing state lawmakers and other policymakers can take for granted: North Carolina’s economy is in recession.
 Many North Carolinians are already feeling its effects. They’ve been laid off, furloughed or seen their self-employment income dwindle to little or nothing. Although lenders, landlords and others will probably let bills go unpaid for a short time, they lack the capacity to float the economy for long.
 That’s why the Federal Reserve, Congress and the White House are scrambling to come up with a policy response that uses some combination of grants and loans to keep enterprises in business and absorb the temporarily unemployed back into the workforce when the immediate crisis abates. State and local governments in North Carolina, as well as private and nonprofit vendors, will play a major role in administering this aid. Good.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — At first, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker tried to play nice. He limited criticisms of the federal government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and asked for medical supplies through official channels.
 But nothing came, so he went on television. The first-term Democrat blasted the Trump administration Sunday on CNN for failing to help states obtain masks, gloves and other protective gear.
 It got President Donald Trump’s attention. After a Twitter feud and some mudslinging (Pritzker compared Trump to a “carnival barker”), the two got on the phone Monday, and Trump promised Illinois 250,000 masks and 300 ventilators.
 Facing an unprecedented public health crisis, governors are trying to get what they need from Washington, and fast. But that means navigating the disorienting politics of dealing with Trump, an unpredictable president with a love for cable news and a penchant for retribution.
 Republicans and Democrats alike are testing whether to fight or flatter, whether to back channel requests or go public, all in an attempt to get Trump’s attention and his assurances.
 At stake may be access to masks, ventilators and other personal protective gear critically needed by health care workers, as well as field hospitals and federal cash. As Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D-Mich., put it, “I can’t afford to have a fight with the White House.”
 Underlying this political dance is Trump’s tendency to talk about the government as though it’s his own private business. The former real estate mogul often discusses government business like a transaction dependent on relationships or personal advantage, rather than a national obligation.
 “We are doing very well with, I think, almost all of the governors, for the most part,” he said during a town hall on Fox News on Tuesday. “But you know, it’s a two-way street. They have to treat us well.”
 On a private conference call Thursday with Trump, governors from both parties pressed the president for help — some more forcefully than others.
 Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, urged Trump to use his full authority to ramp up production of necessary medical equipment, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by AP. But Trump said the federal government is merely the “backup.”
 “I don’t want you to be the backup quarterback, we need you to be Tom Brady here,” Inslee replied, invoking the football star and Trump friend.
 West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican, meanwhile, was lavish in his praise.
 “We’re just so appreciative, but we really need you,” Justice told Trump.
 California’s Gavin Newsom, usually a fierce Trump critic, is among those who have gone out of their way not to lay the federal government’s failings during the coronavirus outbreak at Trump’s feet.
 Newsom complimented Trump for “his focus on treatments” for the virus and thanked him for sending masks and gloves to California. He said the president was “on top of it” when it came to improving testing and said Trump was aware “even before I offered my own insight” of the state’s need for more testing swabs.
 It’s an approach informed by Newsom’s past dealing with Trump during devastating wildfires. While Trump always has approved California’s requests for disaster declaration following fires, just days into Newsom’s tenure last year Trump threatened the state’s access to disaster relief money.
 Trump has kept a close eye on the coronavirus media coverage and noted which local officials were praising or criticizing him, according to three aides who spoke on condition on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the president’s private deliberations. In conversations, Trump has blasted Whitmer and praised Newsom, they said.
 There’s no evidence that Trump has held up a governor’s request for assistance for personal or political reasons. Still aides say it’s understood that governors who say nice things about the federal response are more likely to be spared public criticism from the White House or threats of withheld assistance.
 Trump approved California’s request for a statewide disaster declaration within hours of Newsom asking on Sunday. Trump also has sent a Naval medical ship as well as eight field hospitals. New Jersey will be getting four field hospitals after a phone call between the president and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has not criticized the president during the crisis.
 Republican governors are navigating particularly difficult waters, knowing that any comments viewed as critical of the president could anger Trump’s loyal fans in their state. Some Republicans spoke out against Trump’s talk of reopening the U.S. economy by Easter in mid-April. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, head of the nonpartisan National Governors Association, called the White House messaging “confusing.”
 GOP Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, who lead on the early action, described himself as “aligned” with Trump, but then also noted the state’s model did not show cases peaking until May 1. DeWine appealed to Ohioans to continue to stay home to limit the spread of the virus.
 Those close to DeWine say he understands the importance of picking his battles.
 “I think he recognizes this unprecedented once-in-a-century situation is bigger than politics,” said Ryan Stubenrauch, a former DeWine policy and campaign staffer.
 It’s unusual to see a president and governors publicly feuding and name- calling while their country teeters on the brink of disaster. In past recent crises, presidents and state leaders have gone out of their way to show that politics plays no role in disaster response, and to project the appearance of cooperation. In 2005, as Republican President George W. Bush’s administration received criticism for its handling of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, there was never a sense he was withholding help for personal reasons, said former Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.
 “I never had to worry that President Bush would be angry with me, personally, so he wouldn’t help the people of my state,” she said. “I knew he wasn’t a petty leader.”
 In this moment, some governors have zigzagged between compliments and confrontation, knowing the president responds to both. When Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., was frustrated last week that Trump had not stepped up the federal response to hard-hit regions, he tried a counterintuitive approach, going on cable news to praise Trump for changing his tone about the severity of the virus.
 In a call to the White House, Cuomo delivered the same grateful message privately, according to two officials with knowledge of the conversation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly talk about the private discussions.
 Trump later expressed happiness to aides and advisers that Cuomo had said such nice things about him, according to two White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing.
 A week later, when Cuomo delivered an urgent, frustrated plea for ventilators Tuesday, he didn’t mention Trump by name. Shortly after, a White House official said 4,000 more ventilators would be shipped to New York.
 But later that day, Trump vented to aides, complaining that Cuomo made it seem like Washington had abandoned him, according to those White House officials and Republicans.
 His anger broke through during the town hall. When Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator for the coronavirus response, was describing testing problems and mentioned New York’s high transmission rate, Trump interjected, trying to push Birx to criticize Cuomo: “Do you blame the governor for that?”

“This is another great example of our community coming together to meet basic needs in times of a crisis,” Burke County Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Larry Putnam said. “I am thankful for the connections, partnerships and friendships that make donations such as this possible. I have known the Rices for years. The fact that the Rices had this connection with The Good Kitchen, a passion for this community and our students and the heart to bring those connections together means young children and their families have a few less meals to worry about this weekend.”
 Chasity Rice said she is happy to be able to bring these forces together to help children and families in Burke County.
 “We saw this as an opportunity to be able to connect The Good Kitchen with Burke County Public Schools and bring these meals here in these uncharted times,” she said. “I am proud of the school system and Dr. Putnam’s leadership and all of the employees and volunteers who have stepped up to help during this time. The teachers are checking in on the kids, and the district is organizing food distribution and offering childcare. I can’t applaud them enough for taking care of our kids. I am happy to be able to connect these dots. Isn’t that what we are supposed to do -- to help each other?”
 “We are incredibly grateful to be in a position to donate meals during this unprecedented pandemic," said Amber Lewis, founder of The Good Kitchen. "We are so thankful for Burke County Public Schools and their ability to execute the distribution of these meals in our home state. So many people are flocking to the grocery store and cooking at home, but those in food insecure areas do not have this luxury. Being able to provide a meal that is healthy and well balanced to children is more important than ever.”
 The meals, which retail for $4.95, come frozen and with instruction on heating them. They can be kept frozen for a year or refrigerated for seven days. They include a protein (such as meatballs or chicken nuggets), a vegetable and a brownie.
 Chasity Rice said she has tried all of the meals and likes them. She has a tip for heating the meals.
 “Take the brownie out before heating so it doesn’t burn,” she said.

Redford's journey leads him from his own power utility in California all the way to Buffalo, New York, which will soon house one of the largest clean energy farms in the country. Along the way, he talks with the VP of environmental policy for Apple, muses over the Navy's new line of fleets that runs on biofuel, and sits in on an emotional plea for fair solar power policy in Nevada. More serious moments are offset by playful snippets of Redford's daily attempts to live a little greener in light of all he has learned.
 The most memorable characters from the film are the politicians working to introduce renewable energy in their communities. Their dedication across party lines instills hope that a greener country isn't so far away. Take Mayor Dale Ross, a Republican who fought to make Georgetown, Texas, one of the first cities to be powered by 100 percent renewable energy.
 "If you make a decision based on facts, it will be a good decision. We'll run out of coal before we run out of wind and sun," Ross said in a panel following the film's NYC premiere. "This is the right thing to do. When you make the economic choice, you also make the environmentally friendly one, it turns out."
 "If we don't have people in legislative bodies making changes, we'll make the same mistakes over and over," added Senator Patricia Spearman, a Democrat from Nevada who is working to make her state a clean energy powerhouse.
 The film aims to be a beacon of hope in a climate discourse that is often gloomy, and it succeeds. As Ross puts it, "We're at a tipping point right now with renewable energy—and we're going to win."
