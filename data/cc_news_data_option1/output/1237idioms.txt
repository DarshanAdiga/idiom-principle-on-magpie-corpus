Eight days after OU announced some student jobs would not be able to continue this semester, OU Housing and Residence Life sent an email to student employees that it would not be able to continue student employment this semester due to reduced campus operations in light of the coronavirus.
 According to the email obtained by The Daily, the employees will receive two- week transition pay, and OU will offer emergency financial assistance that students can apply for with the Sooners Helping Sooners campaign.
 OU Housing and Food Services recommended students living in residence halls move out due to COVID-19 related health concerns early last week, allowing some students to stay who are unable travel home or who do not have other living arrangements.

NORWELL -- After the Pithie family was forced to cancel Vivian's 10th birthday party Saturday, friends and neighbors came together to make sure her day was still special.
 At 10:50 a.m., Vivian's mother sent her down their long driveway to fetch a package from grandma in the mailbox, which had just been surreptitiously wrapped in metallic pink balloons by her older siblings.
 But there was no package. A minute later, a line of cars full of Vivian's friends and family rolled by -- some blowing kazoos and spraying silly string, and others with little heads and hands poking out holding signs and gifts -- all to wish Vivian a happy birthday.
 Before coronavirus reached pandemic levels, Vivian, a fourth-grader at Grace F. Cole Elementary School, had a birthday party planned at an escape room with her friends and family. When her mother, Renee Pithie, broke the news that her party could no longer happen, she was understandably bummed.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to PatriotLedger.com to sign up for alerts and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 "She didn't want anyone to forget," said Renee. "It's 10, double digits. It' a big deal."
 But Renee saw through social media that people were having mini parades to celebrate their loved ones, so she decided she'd plan one for Vivian.
 "It's just one of those things. You try an idea and [my friends] ran with it," she said. "We're so lucky to live in this community. You never know what people are willing to do and I'm so thankful."
 On Friday night, while Vivian's older sisters were giving her a "makeover" for the surprise, Renee made a last-minute request to see if Norwell Police would join. They replied in moments, she said.
 The next morning, three of their police cruisers formed the tail of the parade, ringing their sirens and wishing Vivian a happy birthday over their loudspeakers.
 "I was really surprised and it makes me feel really happy and excited," said Vivian, smiling ear to ear. As the cars turned back around for a final pass, they handed off their balloons and signs for her to keep.
 "I've lived 40 years at this address and I've never seen anything quite like that," said Jason Pithie, Vivian's father. "Mommy pulled it off."
 The 10-year-old planned to spend the rest of her special day decorating cupcakes, opening presents and enjoying Chinese takeout with her parents and three siblings, Griffin, Charlotte and Isabel.
 As her siblings carried signs and presents back to the house, Vivian gave her mom another big hug, thanking her for this special gift.

FARGO, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota officials began outlining worst- case scenarios — including building temporary hospitals in Bismarck and Fargo — after health officials Saturday confirmed the highest number of COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period. The state listed 26 new cases of coronavirus between Friday and Saturday afternoons, raising the total number of positive tests to 94. Gov. Doug Burgum said during a news briefing that the number might be closer to 1,000 cases, applying some models that have been used around the world. “We were very flat in the beginning,” Burgum said. “Now, it appears we are on this climb upward that other states have seen.” Burgum said modeling should become more precise once that state tops 100 cases, but revealed estimates Saturday that showed the state having anywhere between 600 and 1,300 positive tests three weeks down the road. He urged residents to follow state guidelines in order to stay on the low end of that model. Maj. Gen. Alan Dohrman, the state's National Guard commander, said officials have been meeting with representatives from the university system, hospitals and the Army Corps of Engineers about turning facilities at Bismarck State College and North Dakota State University into hospitals. Dohrman also put out a plea to retired health care workers to help “form a pool of human resources.” Dohrman said the state has currently located 408 ventilators, which he said “is pretty good for a state our size.” For the first time in several days, Burgum did not unveil any executive orders. However, State Health Officer Mylynn Tufte issued a confinement order for people coming into the state from out of the country or from 23 states with widespread community cases. Those people must stay at home for 14 days after...

 I want to address the concerns that Ascension Parish is ranked high in the country for having a large per capita number of positive Coronavirus cases. I truly believe the reason is simply that we are ahead of the curve with testing here in Ascension Parish. This is due to the professionalism and organization of our healthcare experts.
 This morning our Administration spent time on phone calls with our medical professionals to help gain insight. I now have a better appreciation for the logic behind the numbers.
 Here is the first reason our numbers are higher than other surrounding areas. The fact is that we have taken a proactive approach to testing our citizens. Some of the surrounding communities have yet to implement community testing. If you conduct more tests you will get more positive cases.
 Also, our testing was not random. Everyone tested in Ascension Parish was screened by a medical professional prior to being tested. The probability of our citizens testing positive will naturally be higher than other communities where screening measures either did not take place or did not rise to the high level of criteria Ascension uses. Therefore, because each community has different protocol for testing you are not exactly comparing apples to apples.
 One other contributing factor is the fact that Ascension Parish is a bedroom community. Most of our residents have family members all over the state that they regularly visit. Being a bedroom community with a robust economy, our community is inherently more mobile, with thousands of people traveling out of the parish to visit family each week, as well as the thousands of people who travel every day into Ascension Parish to work at the many businesses and industries we are fortunate to have here.
 In closing, I can't say enough about our healthcare workers and all essential employees in our region. We are all so concentrated on the positive case numbers that we tend to forget about our fellow residents who are on the front lines helping not only coronavirus patients, but the flu, strep throat, cancers, and heart issues that continue to affect the public every day. How many people are recovering from all these alignments each day? I just don't want to forget our frontline staff who are warriors and helping to save lives and keep our Parish operational. Please continue to follow the Governor's guidelines of staying at home, social distancing and washing your hands to help flatten the curve. I wish for all our residents to stay healthy, stay infomred, and may God bless us all.
 Sincerely,
 Clint COintment

El gobierno panameño autorizó el paso por el Canal de Panamá del crucero "Zaandam", quien se encuentra en aguas del país centroamericano tras la muerte de cuatro pasajeros y el contagio por coronavirus de al menos dos de sus ocupantes.
 "Ante la situación de la embarcación 'Zaandam', los asesores de COVID-19 y el ministerio de Salud, de manera coordinada con la Autoridad del Canal de Panamá (ACP) han reevaluado la medida atendiendo el reglamento sanitario para brindar una ayuda humanitaria que le permita continuar hasta su destino", informó este sábado el gobierno panameño.
 Sin embargo, advierte en la misma nota, que "ningún pasajero ni miembro de la tripulación de esta embarcación podrá desembarcar en suelo panameño".
 La embarcación zarpó de Buenos Aires el 7 de marzo con unas 1.800 personas a bordo, pero la pandemia de coronavirus y los sucesivos cierres de fronteras y puertos sorprendió al barco, que tenía la intención de atravesar el Canal de Panamá para seguir su ruta hacia Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
 Sin embargo, el Ministerio de Salud de Panamá, que es quien debe dar el permiso para que un barco cruce el Canal durante la pandemia, se lo había negado.
 El viernes, la compañía Holland America Line, a cargo del buque, anunció que cuatro pasajeros mayores han muerto en el "Zaandam" durante la travesía --sin precisar la causa-- y otros dos han sido afectados por el nuevo coronavirus.
 Según la empresa, 53 pasajeros y 85 tripulantes reportaron síntomas de gripe al centro médico del buque afectado.
 La compañía comenzó este sábado a evacuar a un grupo de personas desde el "Zaandam" al buque "Rotterdam", que se desplazó desde San Diego, en Estados Unidos, a Panamá, para asistir en altamar al crucero con suministros, personal y kits de prueba del nuevo coronavirus.
 "Ya inició la transferencia de pasajeros asintómaticos del crucero 'Zaandam' hacia el crucero 'Rotterdam' a través de los botes de desembarco de pasajeros", indicó la Autoridad Marítima de panamá en su cuenta de Twitter.
 Aunque el mensaje no dice el número de personas transbordadas, en la víspera, el ministro de Asuntos Marítimos y administrador de la AMP, Noriel Araúz, dijo a la AFP que 401 personas que no dieron positivo en las pruebas de COVID-19, pasarían del crucero "Zaandam" al "Rotterdam".

DETROIT (AP) — As the United States led the world with confirmed coronavirus cases, cities such as Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans grew as hotspots Saturday, while the virus continued to pummel New York City and made its way into rural America.
 Elsewhere, Russia said its borders would be fully closed as of Monday, while in parts of Africa, pandemic prevention measures took a violent turn, with Kenyan police firing tear gas and officers elsewhere seen on video hitting people with batons.
 Worldwide infections surpassed 640,000 with nearly 30,000 deaths as new cases also stacked up quickly in Europe, according to a tally by John Hopkins University. The U.S. leads the world in reported cases with more than 112,000, but five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France. Italy alone now has 10,023 deaths, the most of any country.

The latest landmark came only two days after the world passed half a million infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, showing that much work remains to be done to slow the spread of the virus. It showed more than 615,000 cases and over 28,000 deaths.

Tons of businesses are losing astronomical amounts of money during the current coronavirus outbreak, and one of those companies happens to be Disney.   Since the pandemic, Disney has been forced to close down all of its parks around the world, as well as halt production on movies, TV shows, and their ESPN division has taken a hit with no live sports. It was recently noted that Disney is losing around $20 million a day after being forced to close down its parks, but according to a report from Blog Mickey, there is still one part of the Walt Disney World Resort that remains open in Florida.   The Walt Disney World’s golf course is up and running in Orange County. While Orange County, Florida is currently under a “stay at home” order due to the coronavirus, golf courses are exempt from the order.   For those who don’t know, The Walt Disney World golf course features an 18-hole course, as well as a nine-hole footgolf course – seemingly a mixture of soccer and golf – and is very popular. And for now, it’s still available to the public in the midst of the coronavirus madness that has essentially stopped the world from being able to work.
 Honestly, I’m not sure how smart of a move this is. Typically, golf attracts those who are a little more up there in age, and given COVID-19 has a higher death rate with senior citizens, this has bad idea written all over it. Hopefully people make the smart decision to stay home during this time, but as we know, Floridians were still partying it up on the beach while the virus’ impact was on the rise.   The current stay at home order is in effect until April 9th and although the golf course is open, it does ask that you pay green fees online when your tee times are scheduled. Also, if you plan on paying in person, only credit and debit cards will be accepted, no cash.

The elder Blanchard encouraged his son’s athletic pursuits. At age 13, Doc was put on a train from South Carolina to Bay St. Louis to attend Saint Stanislaus where his father graduated. The motive was to get his academics on the straight and narrow under the guidance of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart but athletics remained his focus. He starred in all sports but excelled in football. He started as a freshman in 1938 and helped lead SSC to an undefeated season, a Gulf Coast Championship and a berth in the Toy Bowl. That season he was teammates with Celestin J. “Pete” Taylor who would go on to become the head baseball coach and athletic director at the University of Southern Mississippi. The baseball park at USM is named in Taylor’s memory and he has since been inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.

 Twenty-third Judicial Circuit Judge Debra McLaughlin had ordered the ballots in question to be counted as part of a recount on Nov. 6, but the decision was immediately appealed.
 McLaughlin had concluded that the four ballots should be included in a recount because the voters’ names were left out of the poll book due to a technical error involving the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles.

Has anyone read Trump’s Big Cuts. Big spending in his White House budget. About time you do. He has set out his policy priorities, should he win the re- election in November. His plan is to eliminate the federal deficit which is on track to top $1 trillion this year for the first time since 2012. It really went up, thanks to his 2017 tax cuts for corporations and the rich. Instead of the rich paying their fair share of taxes, Trump is going to cut Medicare and Medicaid $2 trillion and other entitlements. Broad cuts in state department losing 7.7 percent of its funding in 2021. The EPA - 26.5 percent, education department - 7.8 percent. He wants $2 Billion, a capital B, for his border wall. NASA would get $3 Billion, a capital B, to build a luner and the Pentagon would get an additional funding $18 Billion, a capital B, for the new Space Force. As he wants American dominance in space, only to glorify himself, as he tells you himself, he’s the greatest thing that has ever happen to this country. It’s OK not to take care of the poor and the sick. There are so many Americans that cannot afford health care and depend on Medicare and Medicaid. Americans that have worked all their life. Why is it so much more important to have dominance in outer space that it’s more important than the American people. Cutting spending on the Center of Disease Control in the middle of a Coronavirus epidemic is unreal. The cost of living has overcome wages. Households are spending half or more of their income on housing. Young people simply can’t afford to move to areas where the best jobs are. Health care is higher, higher premiums, deductibles and out of pocket cost, are putting millions in debt. Childcare cost have went up 2,000 percent. In other wealthy countries child care and education are out of government funds for public use. Better start doing some arithmetic folks.

 The top priority of the Community Bankers in Michigan is to protect the health and well-being of our banks, our customers, and every resident of our great state. Banks have taken significant safety and service measures such as expanded drive-thru banking hours and opening more drive through lanes, and keeping their bank lobbies open, but often going to lobby visits by appointment to protect customers and employees. Banks have increased staffing in their call centers and expanded calling hours in many cases. Most have called their business clients, farm clients, and nonprofit/charity/church clients to check on their needs and have contacted local government officials to stay up to speed with the latest developments. We are working with government and regulators to relax rules that will help keep bankers and customers safe. In addition to their responsibility to keep customers and employees safe, community banks are also making special arrangements with customers who still depend on personalized banking services such as the elderly or those dealing with disabilities.
 Customers can help their banks better serve their communities by doing their part. Clean your hands before you go to the bank or handle cash, wipe down ATMs before and after you use them, do your banking electronically, send an email with your request or call your bank. If you have a banking need that requires a lobby visit, make an appointment and please do not visit the bank if you are sick or not feeling well. Businesses can use night deposit boxes, courier services, or armored car services provided by their bank to minimize trips to the bank. Your bank will work with you to accommodate your banking needs -- call them and they will respond.
 Community banks have been working around the clock to implement pandemic protocols, which address not only hygiene and cleanliness for customers and employees, but also testing procedures, checking back-up systems in case any critical system is impacted, and they have also looked at how to accommodate all types of customers so they can maintain access to vital banking services.
 The Community Bankers of Michigan has been in constant communication with our banks, giving them practical advice and access to resources. Our staff has been working long hours and keeping well-connected with our banks to share best practices for keeping customers well served and safe, and for making sure bank employees are informed on the best ways to serve clients while they stay safe and healthy.
 I am very proud of the extraordinary flexibility Michigan banks are extending to their small-business borrowers: farmers, nonprofits, and just recently even local municipal governmental units who are now facing revenue shortfalls. Banks are waiving certain fees or modifying repayment plans, adjusting payment due dates, or extending or increasing lines of credit to ease the pain of temporary layoffs. Michigan community banks are rising to every challenge this crisis presents.
 Banks have plans for major business interruptions and they have activated them. Our Michigan banks are the strongest they have ever been, and they are well prepared to serve the citizens of Michigan in this critical time. Every bank has plenty of liquidity and they are backed by the FDIC, so deposits are safe and sound in the bank. The FDIC Insurance is rock solid, safeguarding our customers' deposits up to $250,000. The wrong thing for you to do would be to withdraw a lot of cash from your bank account simply because you want your cash on hand.
 The best place for your money is in the bank! The banks will be there through this crisis, just as they were there through the last recession. No Michigan resident lost money in a bank deposit during the last crisis, and you will not lose any money on a deposit at your bank in this crisis either. Our banks are even better prepared this time around, and you will once again see just how important your community bank is to rebuild your community and your businesses after this crisis is over.
 Mike Tierney   President and CEO, Community Bankers of Michigan

Owens said they have also been distributing disinfectant to residents for free, having handed out 9,000 gallons to residents of the county on Friday alone.
 They’ve hired De Nora Neptune, a global disinfection company that's been disinfecting frac water in the Permian Basin for over a decade.
 The bleach solution was first developed to be used in the oilfields.
 “It's a mobile bleach factory. So that factory can be taken out to a frac and disinfect large quantities of water,” said De Nora Nepture President Alex Gonzalez.
 Gonzalez is referring to one of the company's 14 Mobile Treatment Units, one of which can make of 25,000 gallons of the bleach solution a day.  
 He said the solution is a low concentration of sodium hypo-chlorite or bleach that’s created by using “food-grade salt, water and electricity.”
 Gonzalez said the bleach disinfectant can be used to spray on surfaces to kill the coronavirus.
 “The CDC has released in all their documentations that an effective method for killing viruses and bacteria is bleach,” Gonzales said.
 This week, a stream of cars lined up at the Val Verde County fairgrounds— residents bringing containers that county crews filled up with the bleach solution.
 “I carry a bottle in my truck. I spray the handles at the gas station, I spray door handles,” Gonzalez said.  “The sodium hypo-chlorite will kill bacteria and viruses on contact. So it's a very effective way to disinfect.”
 Gonzalez said the MTU has also been deployed to Fort Bend County near Houston and will be in Maverick County this weekend.
 “This is so Texan. If you think about the way we're approaching this, we're not sitting back waiting for COVID to come get us,” said Gonzalez. “We're eliminating and killing it before it has a chance to do anything.”
 Owens said bringing the MTU to Val Verde County was unanimously supported by county commissioners. He said the MTU costs the county $8,000 a day.
 “I don't think any of us at the end of the day are going to be completely prepared for this, and we're learning as we go,” Owens said. “Rest assured, the county, the city, we're all doing whatever it's going to take. We will do it to make sure that our citizens are safe.”

Dr. Baldwin explained that this is unprecedented times and there is no road map. He compared this crisis to that of the crisis in 1918, and reminded folks that schools did not close down then, the way we are doing now. As far as learning, teachers are gathering lessons online and in packets that parents can pick up at schools, to provide review and reinforcement. Dr. Baldwin explained that nothing can replace one on one, face to face, interactions with teachers.

Hopefully by the middle of this year, maybe a little later, we are hoping to get our first album released,” Radford said. “I think individually since we will be kind of staying at home, we might be passing ideas back and forth for new songs, as well as doing our own separate recordings to post online because now more than ever a virtual presence is important for a lot of bands.”
