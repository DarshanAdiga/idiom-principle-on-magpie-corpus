 Speaking of anniversaries (though on a considerably smaller scale in terms of human history), congrats to Carl Nolt and the crew at Serranos Coffee in Monument on their 25th. A half-decade after the end of the conflict in Europe and the Pacific, this defector from the Seattle coffee scene set up shop in the space now occupied by Jarrito Loco in the Safeway shopping center.
 25 years later and going on a decade in their own building across the street from the First National Bank (and adjacent to another coffee franchise that shall remain nameless), Serranos is a Monumental institution and a gathering place for kids of all ages … full-strength and decaf. (And no, there’s no apostrophe in the name — it’s the plural of “serrano,” Spanish for person of the mountains, or something to that effect.) “It’s been a good year, all things considered,” says Carl. Here’s to another 25 (at least)!

All we are is dust in the wind,   is an understatement here in Nebraska.   Because here, it’s the dust of   a thousand back country roads,   that keeps the landscape alive.      That same dust was kicked up   by the buffalo and horses   of the Plains Indians.   That same dust found its way   into the cabins of   the first pioneers to tread the land.      It’s the dust of those country roads   that mars and scars the old wood   of the barns, farmhouses, and road signs.   That dust paints a vivid picture   of the distant past, the present day,   and the oncoming future.      Particles of dusty DNA   are carried far on strong winds.   Those same winds once   blew winter storms away,   sent tornadoes howling   and screaming across the prairie.      Wind and dust created a wild dance,   like barroom betties kicking up their heels.   It’s the wind and the dust   that we endure out here in the sticks   of Nebraska.      Because if we can survive that,   we can survive anything.      © Copyright 2019 by Tom Frye

Thousands of LDS members followed Young to Utah in later years. Tensions built during the 1850s as LDS members felt persecuted for their beliefs. According to Hampton Sides in “Blood and Thunder,” “Utah had been seething with tension during the months leading up to the massacre; Mormons had good reason to fear that the U.S. Army was on its way from Fort Laramie to occupy Salt Lake City. All-out war seemed imminent.”
 The wagon train (about 35 wagons and several hundred cattle) originated in northwest Arkansas and was called the Baker-Fancher party after the two leaders. Several groups made their way to Salt Lake City, joined up and headed southwest. In an area called Mountain Meadows, they were attacked on Sept. 7, 1857. After five days of fighting and running low on food and ammunition, the members surrendered to LDS militiamen carrying a white flag of truce. According to a sign at the site, “The militiamen deceived their victims into surrendering weapons and property for protection and safety.” Instead, the emigrants were separated in three groups and killed. Only 17 small children were spared — they were taken in by local families. (Two years later the children were sent back to Arkansas to their relatives.) To add to the horror, the bodies were either not buried or buried hastily and found later scattered and scavenged.

First, let me say that I was a big fan of Dr. Hairston. She appeared on my _Triad Today_ television program multiple times to discuss various policy initiatives, and I can tell you that she was the real deal. Angela didn’t need any on-the-job-training or adjustment period. She hit the ground running, was a good listener, and wasn’t afraid to make decisions. Her proposals didn’t always meet with Board approval, but when extra money was needed for increasing teacher pay, Dr. Hairston successfully lobbied voters to pass a sales tax referendum to cover the cost— not an easy task considering Forsyth County had rejected a similar tax hike just two years before.
 She was also the kind of leader we needed in case the school system was ever faced with a crisis, so when COVID-19 appeared, Angela effectively navigated the school system through state-ordered shutdowns, implementation of online learning, and a confusing set of mandates for re-opening.
 Hairston’s handling of the pandemic was masterful and comforting, yet, as _The Broad Center’s_ report warned, _“It’s problematic if educators adjust to one leader’s vision for the district if that person then leaves as plans are coming to fruition.”_
 Translation? It’s not a good idea to leave your job in the middle of a pandemic, regardless of the reasons.
 Dr. Hairston’s sudden departure is unusual by local standards. In fact, all of the WSFCS superintendents in recent memory have remained on the job for at least three years. Angela’s immediate predecessor, Beverly Emory, served for five years; Marvin Ward, who presided over the system for much of the 1960s and 1970s, served for 13 years; and Don Martin (who preceded Emory), held the post for 19 years. A typical superintendent’s contract runs for two to four years, with the Board offering extensions in one to two-year increments, so no matter how you spin it, Hairston’s leaving was an anomaly.
 Speaking of contracts, in the old days, a superintendent who left the job early was required to reimburse the school board for the money they spent on recruitment. According to the North Carolina School Board Association, the average cost to search for and hire a new superintendent is around $15,000, but that figure is much higher whenever a national headhunting firm is employed. Sources tell me that no such reimbursement clause exists in Hairston’s contract, but it should.
 As much as I admire Angela, and as sympathetic as I am to anyone who wants to return to her roots, there should be a price to pay for abandoning ship just after leaving port.
 Going forward, all local school boards should include a reimbursement clause in every new contract. It costs a lot of money to find the right person, and it costs a lot of momentum when that person leaves early.
 Someone needs to pay for the damages.

Australian all-rounder Shane Watson announced his retirement from all cricket after Chennai Super Kings’ campaign came to an end in the 2020 edition of Indian Premier League.
 Before the announcement came from the 39-year-old, he is reported to have told his Chennai teammates of his decision in an “emotional” speech after their last IPL game on Sunday.
 Watson quit international cricket in 2016 but kept playing in Twenty20 leagues such as the IPL. He retired from Australia’s Big Bash last year.
 He has played more than 700 international and domestic matches, scoring more than 25,000 runs with his big-hitting style and claiming in excess of 600 wickets with his pace bowling.
 The man nicknamed Watto won the inaugural IPL in 2008 with the Shane Warne-led Rajasthan Royals and secured a second with Chennai in 2018.
 “It really does feel like the right time, knowing that I played my last game of cricket ever for my beloved CSK, who have been so incredibly good to me over the last years,” Watson said.

September 8, 1938 - October 27, 2020 Mike R. Vasquez, known as Don Miguel and fondly Mickey, was born on September 8, 1938 in Phoenix, Arizona. He died peacefully at his family home in Corona, California on October 27, 2020 at the age of 82. Born to Mike and Andrea Vasquez and raised in San Bernardino, California, Mike was the oldest of seven children and took on the role of a fatherly figure to his siblings at a young age, working hard to help provide for his family. Road trips were frequent weekend adventures and eating together was a favorite past time. Mike's early career began in carpentry, working in construction with his brothers. One day on a trip to Mexico in 1961, Mike was introduced to Mary Sanchez, and it was love at first sight. The couple continued a long-distance relationship while Mary was living in Central Mexico. After 3 years of courting, Mike proposed, and they married in November 1964. The newlyweds moved to San Bernardino where they lived for 8 years before moving to their forever home in the city of Corona. In 1973 Mike and Mary turned their love of food and family into a business that would eventually become a tradition across Southern California. Taking over an existing restaurant location in Corona, they renamed it "Miguel's" in honor of Mike's grandfather. Mike guided the business operations and Mary oversaw the culinary side of the restaurant concept. Two years later, business was growing, and they leased a fast-food restaurant just two miles down the road and named it "Miguel's Jr." As the company continued a path of growth and expansion, Mike was proud to watch his children take on leadership roles and continue the family legacy that he and Mary built together. Today there are over 20 locations in the family-owned and operated restaurant portfolio, spanning across the Inland Empire and Orange County. Mike had a driven, hands- on, and hardworking approach to business and a larger than life personality, all of which made him a natural leader. He valued working with family and having the opportunity to give back and support the people and places that were most important to him. Philanthropy became a guiding principle of his life and work, and he made a positive and lasting impact on his family, employees, and the community. In recent years Mike stepped back from Miguel's Restaurants' operations, yet continued to visit the restaurants frequently and meet with the employees providing insight and inspiration. He always had a big smile, loved making others laugh and never turned down a homemade meal. He enjoyed working in his yard, watching football on Sundays, helping at his church, and spending as much time with family as possible. Mike was preceded in death by his two brothers Henry and Daniel Vasquez. Mike is survived and dearly missed by his wife, Mary, four sisters, Elizabeth, Virginia, Yolanda and Carolyn, six children Eva, Danny, Michael, Carol, Sylvia and Javier, son- in-law Eric, daughter-in-law Gabriela, and fourteen grandchildren Renato, Melissa, Anthony, Brianna, Michael, David, Danny, Darrell, Alejandro, Lauren, Isabel, Emma, Alyssa and Luke. He will rest in peace at Pierce Brothers Crestlawn Memorial Park and Mortuary in Riverside. A drive-in celebration of life will be held on Thursday, November 5 from 1-3 p.m. in the parking lot at The Shops at Dos Lagos. In lieu of flowers, consider donating to Friends of the Corona Public Library in Mike's name.

The comparisons between Biden and FDR aren’t entirely unfounded.

Despite the appeal of very progressive policies to some, it should be noted that it is not always digestible for many moderate Americans.

“We were seeking out others who were affected and afflicted by oil and fossil fuels, and we were reaching out to those who were making headlines,” he said. “I had Faith on the programs several times. I learned she was going to Standing Rock and she was part of the protest.”
 Satiacum had also learned about Spotted Eagle’s work in building coalitions opposing pipelines in Nebraska as well as the Dakotas. “She showed her leadership skills by bringing together farmers, ranchers and people of different colors,” he said.
 Spotted Eagle’s father had predicted his daughter’s destiny in leading their people in the fight to save their resources. While she was a young girl, they sat on the Missouri River banks where their White Swan community had been located before it was flooded by Fort Randall and the other dams.
 “He told me, ‘Little girl, you need to do something about this,’” she recalled. “I thought, ‘I’m only 12 years old. What am I going to do about it?’”
 However, she would eventually lead a grassroots effort to battle for the natural resources. The battle led to her to Standing Rock, where Satiacum heard her speak at the protest and met her for the first time.
 When it came time to cast his electoral vote, Satiacum felt a strong spiritual message from a Native American flute player who performed just before the casting of votes.
 As he took quill pen in hand, Satiacum prepared to write in Bernie Sanders’ name, but he felt moved to put in Spotted Eagle’s name as a tribute to his Native ancestry and her work in protecting the water and other natural resources.
 “Among Indians, we talk about seven generations down the road. My grandchildren will be able to look it up and see how I voted. I wanted to vote for someone who supported the earth,” he said. “Faith Spotted Eagle is a woman who is a real leader and protector. She is able to join and unify people to amplify the message.”
 Spotted Eagle said the elector vote has given added recognition to the ongoing work.
 “My personal life hasn’t changed,” she said. “One of the reporters from CNN asked, ‘Now that Standing Rock is shut down, what do you do?’
 “I just go back and work on my list of 100 things that I still need to do.”

The United States has assured Italian oil company Eni SpA that efforts to prevent a spill at a floating crude facility in Venezuela would not run afoul of sanctions, the company, and the U.S. State Department said on Monday.
 Images in recent months showing the Nabarima floating storage and offloading facility (FSO), part of the Petrosucre joint venture between Eni and Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, tilting to its side have raised concerns of a potential environmental catastrophe.
 The Nabarima has been idle for nearly two years after Washington sanctioned PDVSA as part of its push to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. It holds some 1.3 million barrels of Corocoro crude.
 "Eni's plan to safely offload the Nabarima FSO received on Thursday, Oct. 29, a green light from the U.S. authorities, confirming that the current sanctions policy does not prevent the company from offloading the cargo and repairing the vessel, Eni, which owns 26% of Petrosucre, said in a statement.
 Eni added that it would proceed with its plan upon approval from PDVSA.
 PDVSA, which owns the remaining 74% of Petrosucre, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PDVSA has been preparing its own plan to offload some crude aboard the Nabarima to its Icaro tanker.
 It is not clear if Eni will draft a new offloading plan, or if the companies will move ahead to transfer crude to a PDVSA-operated vessel. Experts have recommended Petrosucre transfer the crude to a dynamic positioning vessel to minimize risks.
 A spokesperson for the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said the department "conveyed our support for emergency repairs" to Eni, but did not specify a stance on offloading the crude.
 "Eni is under no sanctions risk to begin immediate emergency repairs," the spokesperson said in a statement.

Many students found out that their summer internships were canceled and for others, summer jobs didn’t pan out. High school sports were canceled or put on hold and extracurricular clubs were limited to remote events or none at all. Despite this, high school seniors shouldn’t feel that this limits their college applications. In fact, approximately 300 college admissions deans have signed an open letter promising not to penalize students for their lack of participation in extracurricular activities due to the pandemic. Another change is reflected in the Common App, which now includes a question where students describe how the crisis has affected their health and well-being, safety, family circumstances, future plans and education. Applicants can share what they’ve learned during the pandemic, describe how they have risen to the challenges, and illustrate how their life has changed.
 For some high schoolers, fall has traditionally included campus tours and visits. Since most campus tours have been canceled, applicants are encouraged to participate in virtual campus tours and online forums with current students and admissions staff. There are opportunities for video interviews, virtual information sessions and social media live-chats. All of these can help students during the admissions process.
 Lastly, as the pandemic continues to affect employment, financial aid departments are busier than ever before handling an increasing demand for financial aid while the supply of available funds has decreased. Colleges and universities have reduced the numbers of staff positions and salaries amid increased expenses for battling coronavirus. Financial pressure across the board is evident across the nation. Ithaca College moved up plans to eliminate 131 full-time faculty positions while the University of Akron invoked a clause in their collective bargaining agreement to supersede tenure rules and lay off 97 unionized faculty members. To survive the budget crisis, Ohio Wesleyan eliminated 18 majors, the University of Florida is phasing out undergraduate degrees in education while it retains its graduate program, and dozens of doctoral programs have stopped taking new graduate students.
 The pandemic has changed the way colleges approach education while students have tried to adapt. Are these changes temporary or permanent? Will these changes ultimately improve the quality of higher education in America? Only time will tell.

Another argument being used is that "more people die of cancer", but Prof Clarke pointed out "there are very few cancers you can catch from other people".
 He added cancer can be a "manageable disease" with many treatments than can cause it to go into remission or see patients' lives significantly extended.
 Coronavirus, on the other hand, can kill in a matter of weeks, and treatments are still in their early stages.
 He did say Covid-19 and flu are quite similar in that they both affect people with diabetes badly, which is why diabetics are given a a flu jab every winter.
 However, he did add "most people" who get flu and coronavirus make a recovery, saying the "vast majority" would "just feel unwell".
 He said: "But there are enough people that it is a problem. You have to also bear in mind no one knew anything about Covid before the pandemic. No one knew what was going to happen.
 "It is definitely misguided to think it's no worse than flu."

September 8, 1938 - October 27, 2020 Mike R. Vasquez, known as Don Miguel and fondly Mickey, was born on September 8, 1938 in Phoenix, Arizona. He died peacefully at his family home in Corona, California on October 27, 2020 at the age of 82. Born to Mike and Andrea Vasquez and raised in San Bernardino, California, Mike was the oldest of seven children and took on the role of a fatherly figure to his siblings at a young age, working hard to help provide for his family. Road trips were frequent weekend adventures and eating together was a favorite past time. Mike's early career began in carpentry, working in construction with his brothers. One day on a trip to Mexico in 1961, Mike was introduced to Mary Sanchez, and it was love at first sight. The couple continued a long-distance relationship while Mary was living in Central Mexico. After 3 years of courting, Mike proposed, and they married in November 1964. The newlyweds moved to San Bernardino where they lived for 8 years before moving to their forever home, the city of Corona. In 1973 Mike and Mary turned their love of food and family into a business that would eventually become a tradition across Southern California. Taking over an existing restaurant location in Corona, they renamed it "Miguel's" in honor of Mike's grandfather. Mike guided the business operations and Mary oversaw the culinary side of the restaurant concept. Two years later, business was growing, and they leased a fast-food restaurant just two miles down the road and named it "Miguel's Jr." As the company continued a path of growth and expansion, Mike was proud to watch his children take on leadership roles and continue the family legacy that he and Mary built together. Today there are over 20 locations in the family-owned and operated restaurant portfolio, spanning across the Inland Empire and Orange County. Mike had a driven, hands- on, and hardworking approach to business and a larger than life personality, all of which made him a natural leader. He valued working with family and having the opportunity to give back and support the people and places that were most important to him.

Off the Shelf: Cook Memorial Library November update


--DocBreak--
WESTPORT -- He is 21-years old and is running against an incumbent state representative who has served for the last 10 years.
 For Evan Gendreau, those qualities would be an asset to the communities he would represent: Westport, Fall River, New Bedford and Freetown.
 Gendreau, a Republican and a Westport resident, on Nov. 3 will vie for a seat held by fellow Westporter and state Rep. Paul Schmid, a Democrat.
 Gendreau said he continually fields frustrated comments over how local legislators are voting and representing their constituents.
 Gendreau also notes that the 8th Bristol District has not had a Republican on the ballot since 1996.
 A Umass Dartmouth student majoring in political science, Gendreau said he offers a new and fresh perspective.
 Gendreau is also a research assistant at the Public Policy Center in Dartmouth and in 2018 worked on the campaign of former United States Senate candidate Geoff Diehl.
 "I'm running because our district deserves a new voice at the State House. We are facing unprecedented times with a high unemployment rate and many small businesses in our community that are struggling to remain open," Gendreau said in a recent email.
 "Unfortunately, there are many seats that go unopposed in the state legislature, and the last time a Republican was on the ballot in this district was 1996. The residents of Westport, Fall River, New Bedford, and Freetown deserve a choice in this election, especially with so many pressing issues at stake," he added in the email.
 Gendreau attended Fall River and Westport public schools. Citing his recent experience within these local school districts, Gendreau says he has a unique understanding of their challenges.
 Along with advocating for education, Gendreau says he will also advocate for public safety and small businesses.
 He has said that he will oppose legislation aiming to diminish police personnel. Instead, he will lobby Beacon Hill for more support for police, fire, and emergency medical services.
 "I will stand up for fiscally responsible policies that will help grow the local economy, including a lower tax and regulatory burden to help small businesses and working families. Additionally, I will support measures aimed at increasing government accountability and transparency," Gendreau said.
 Gendreau noted on his campaign page that local aid over the years has been reduced by 40 percent since 2001. That aid, he said, would help with road construction and maintenance, school systems while also promoting economic growth.
 Gendreau said he would actively seek development and growth opportunities.
 "Our community has a lot of potential and, as state representative, I will work to capitalize on these opportunities, particularly with education and workforce development," Gendreau said.

I was just lucky to be BORN into such an amazing world. In his carefree bachelor days, my father surely considered climbing the radio transmitter tower and hurling himself to his doom after hearing one too many heavy- rotation plays of that early “earworm” song “RaggMopp” by the Ames Brothers (“R-A-G-G M-O-P-P RaggMopp!”) I hope Dad was polite when he told the DJ where he could put his “stacks o’ wax.”
 My own connection to radio goes all the way back to my toddler days. I overheard a local radio report of a stranger who was hospitalized after a wreck; I became fixated on him and for the next few years, HE was my imaginary friend. No tiger, no pirate, no dragon. MY imaginary friend was some nondescript fender-bender survivor!
 I was stuck in a rut. A few years later, my first FANTASY GIRLFRIEND labored 21 hours a day in the candle factory and would’ve worked more if not for the tuberculosis. (I wonder if her imaginary one-legged kid brother still sells newspapers with a cry of “Wuxtry! Wuxtry! Read all about it!”)
 I cherish memories of receiving a transistor radio (about one-third the size of a walkie talkie) for my 12th birthday. It meant portability, control and freedom. But as Janis Joplin sang, freedom’s just another word for nothing left to buy the replacement BATTERIES with, so I soon went back to listening to the farm futures market on the family radio, like ALL the cool kids.

Okonkwo is an intelligent young man who speaks five languages - including Igbo, pidgin English, patawa (Jamaican) and a little bit of French. English, which he speaks fluently, is hardly his first language. He and his family lived around many bilingual people during his childhood, so he was able to pick up most of it on the fly.

Pep Guardiola said Manchester City’s consistent qualification from the group stages of the Champions League is not given enough credit ahead of hosting Olympiakos on Tuesday.
 City can move to the brink of a place in the last 16 of Europe’s premier club competition for the eighth straight season with victory over the Greek outfit this week..
 Into his fifth campaign in charge in Manchester, Guardiola has received fierce criticism for failing to get beyond the Champions League quarter-finals.
 But he pointed to the struggles of Real Madrid, who have taken just one point from their opening two group games, as an example of how City’s ability to get through with minimum fuss is underestimated.
 “Qualifying is the most important thing because every year there are important clubs (who do not),” said Guardiola.
 “Today the competition is not like one decade ago when I started as a manager, qualifying was easier than right now.”
 City are sitting pretty in Group C with maximum points from their opening two games against Porto and Marseille.
 And Guardiola is keen to mathematically reach the knockout stages as soon as possible to be able to give some key players a rest in November and December with a brutal schedule already taking it’s toll on his squad.
 “Every game is difficult, people don’t believe it,” added Guardiola. “With this pandemic situation around the world everything is more uncertain for all the clubs.
 “Today it doesn’t matter where you have to do a good game to beat them, it’s a tricky competition.
 “That’s why I am delighted with what we have done so far and why we cannot miss this chance.”
 Guardiola insisted his attention would not be drawn to Sunday’s clash with Liverpool in the Premier League.
 But there was encouraging news ahead of the weekend as he hinted Sergio Aguero may be fit to return, while Gabriel Jesus has also resumed training after six weeks out.

The two parties took wildly different approaches to contacting voters amid the pandemic.
 Democrats stopped knocking on doors in the spring, going all-digital and phone. They resumed limited in-person contacts in September. Republicans continued traditional field work the entire campaign.
 The GOP can point to success in increasing their voter registration in battleground states. Democrats can point to their early voting success, including from notable slices of new voters. But only the final tally will vindicate one strategy or the other.
 WILL VOTING BE PEACEFUL?
 Each major party can install official poll watchers at precincts. It's the first time in decades Republicans could use the practice after the expiration of a court order limiting their activities. So it's an open question how aggressive those official poll watchers will be in monitoring voters or even challenging eligibility.
 The bigger issue is likely to be unofficial "poll watchers" -- especially self-declared militias. Voter intimidation is illegal, but Trump, in the Sept. 29 presidential debate, notably refused to state plainly that he'd accept election results and instead said he is "urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully, because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it."
 In Michigan, where federal authorities recently arrested members of anti- government paramilitary groups in an alleged plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic secretary of state tried to impose a ban on carrying firearms openly at a polling place. A Michigan judge struck down the order.
 WHITHER THE EXURBS AND SMALLER CITIES?
 Trump's reelection depends on driving up his margins in rural areas and smaller towns and cities -- those expansive swaths of red on the county-by- county results map from 2016.
 But acres don't vote, people do, and Biden is casting a wide demographic and geographic net. His ideal coalition is anchored in metro areas, but he hopes to improve Democratic turnout among nonwhite voters and college-educated voters across the map.
 There are places where the competing strategies overlap: exurban counties -- those communities on the edges of the large metropolitan footprints -- and counties anchored by smaller stand-alone cities. Both campaigns will be closely watching places like Forsyth County, Georgia, where 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney won 80% of the vote but Trump's share dropped 10 points, and Montgomery County, Ohio, which flipped from Democrat Barack Obama to Trump.
 A 1968 REDUX? HOW ABOUT 1980?
 Trump spent considerable energy this year posturing as a "law and order" president, seeking to replicate 1968, when widespread unrest in the U.S benefited Republican Richard Nixon as he built his "silent majority." But Nixon wasn't the incumbent in 1968. In fact, the political atmosphere was so bad for President Lyndon Johnson that the Democrat didn't seek reelection.
 Many Democrats and some Republicans are now pointing more at 1980, when Republican Ronald Reagan trounced President Jimmy Carter and the GOP flipped a whopping 12 Democratic Senate seats. Trump's standing in the polls over 2020 has tracked only slightly above where Carter spent much of the 1980 election year, as he battled inflation, high unemployment and the Iran hostage crisis. But what appeared a tight race on paper as late as October turned into a rout. Even Democratic heavyweights like Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh and South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, once a presidential nominee, fell.
 It's a more polarized era four decades later. But the lesson is that Trump would defy history to win reelection amid such a cascade of crises and voter dissatisfaction.
 WHEN WILL THE RACE BE CALLED?
 Absentee voting amid coronavirus has changed the vote-counting timeline, and there aren't uniform practices for counting across the states. That makes it difficult to predict when certain key battlegrounds might be called.
 For example, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- battlegrounds Trump won by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 -- aren't expected to have complete totals for days. Florida and North Carolina, meanwhile, began processing early ballots ahead of time, with officials there forecasting earlier unofficial returns. But those two states also could have razor-thin margins.
 Early returns, meanwhile, could show divergent results. Biden's expected to lead comfortably among early voters, who tend to skew toward Democrats. Trump is likely to counter with a lead among Election Day voters. Depending on which counties report which batch of votes first, perennially close states could tempt eager partisans to reach conclusions that aren't necessarily accurate.
