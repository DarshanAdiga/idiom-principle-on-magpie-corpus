Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivered a new proposal for a stimulus package and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he is circulating among Republicans his own revised plan, which has the backing of President Donald Trump.
 The sudden emergence of fresh plans for pandemic relief indicated a new stage in a monthslong saga that’s so far failed to produce a compromise -- even as the coronavirus continues to spread.
 Neither Pelosi nor McConnell offered any details about their latest proposals. McConnell warned that time is running out to agree on a stimulus before the end of the year and there was no point in passing any legislation that Trump won’t sign before he leaves office on Jan. 20.
 “Waiting until next year is not an answer,” McConnell said. “I’m focused on accomplishing as much as we can” over the next three weeks, he said.
 McConnell spoke just hours after a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House and Senate proposed their own $908 billion compromise in an effort to break the stalemate. President-elect Joe Biden separately urged Congress to act before he takes office.
 Biden’s Call
 Biden called on Congress to pass a “robust package” to deal with the economic crisis wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. He added that any package passed in a lame duck session would likely be “at best just a start.”
 McConnell said he was trying to gauge support among the Republican majority in the Senate before publicly unveiling his plan. He said it could be combined with a government funding bill that Congress needs to pass to avoid a partial federal shutdown after Dec. 11.
 Pelosi said in a statement that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would review the proposal she and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer sent Monday night to their GOP counterparts.
 McConnell has previously supported a $500 billion package, but the White House has indicated that Trump is willing back a bigger bill. Still, any stimulus would have to pass in the Democratic controlled House, where Pelosi has been pushing a $2.4 trillion plan.
 Republicans Coordinate
 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the administration has been in talks with McConnell and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy about a “targeted” aid package. Mnuchin said he spoke with the duo, along with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Tuesday morning.

It is the first day of December and all of a sudden it is wintertime! We are in the second week of the deer firearms season here in the Mountain State and the serious hunters got some snow on the ground that they have been waiting for. Here at my satellite office, the Turkey Track Lodge, it is 28 degrees and the wind is what you might say is brisk. I have decided to keep working and not pursue the whitetail buck today, sacrifices have to be made.
 For those that do follow this column out there, and I really appreciate all seven of you that do, you know usually at this time of year I take stock and see what is going on during deer season. The first week of season was fast and furious for yours truly as I was lucky enough to get to hunt with Makayla and Jesse Scott for a couple of days. Again, those of you that tune in to these pages know of Makayla, the spitfire of a shotgun shooter that I have talked about before. Makayla is now eighteen and has a wall full of shooting trophies and medals, is a writer of some note in the shooting world, is a brand ambassador for CZ-USA firearms, and started the first Scholastic Clay Target Program chapter in the state. O yeah, did I mention she organized the building of a trap and skeet field in her own backyard so young shooters would have a place to be introduced to the sport?
 For all her busy schedule in her shooting career, Makayla is an enthusiastic hunter, and her ten-year-old brother Jesse is following in her footsteps. I was looking forward to going hunting with these two, but was feeling the usual pressure when guiding of being able to put them on game.

Johannesburg [South Africa], December 2 (ANI): In light of the coronavirus pandemic, Cricket South Africa (CSA) will conduct a virtual Women Super League 3.0 draft without players, guests, and media on Thursday.   Coaches of the respective teams will announce the draft picks live on CSA's Youtube page and top prospects will take part remotely.   South Africa's premier Women's T20 competition, with star names set to light up the tournament to be held at Six Gun Grill Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town from December 14 to 16.  
 "The WSL T20 tournament focuses on the development of girls' and women's cricket at a high-performance level. The draft will see the blend of Momentum Proteas, under-19, and top-performing provincial cricket players from all over South Africa coming together for this great spectacle to showcase their skills," CSA said in a statement.   The draft will see 13 rounds in total, each team will select one player per round, thus there are four players drafted per round. The initial pick order for the first two rounds is determined by the team's finishing position at the end of the previous season.   In this case, the Coronation finished in first place last season and thus select first. Picking second are the Duchesses, who were last season's runner's up. Selecting third are the Starlights, with the Thistles taking the final pick.   "WSL 3.0 draft is a perfect opportunity for players who have performed admirably in the last cricket calendar year to be rewarded for their hard work and dreams are realized with their selections in the draft," said CSA Acting CEO Kugandrie Govender.   "Safeguarding the health and well-being of our players, employees, and everyone connected to our game as well as the general cricket community is paramount. With that in mind, we will work diligently with our production team, to create a memorable but virtual event that appropriately honours these accomplished female cricketers," he added. (ANI)

"Ik vind _Lingo_ oprecht een fantastisch spel, het is na al die afleveringen nog steeds leuk: altijd andere kandidaten met een eigen verhaal, mensen die er zin in hebben en een beetje zenuwachtig zijn.

 Versteegh houdt er rekening mee dat hij het niet zolang op televisie zal volhouden. "De kans is natuurlijk klein dat ik net als Paul de Leeuw en Robert ten Brink op mijn zestigste nog televisie kan maken, dus eigenlijk moet ik op zoek naar een plan B, iets dat ik naast televisie maken ook leuk zou vinden", aldus de presentator, die toegeeft nog niet te weten wat hij anders zou moeten doen.

“For 28 turnovers on the game ... it’s tough to win a ball game when you turn the ball that many times, especially 17 times in one half,” said Bluefield State head coach Ryan Bailey.
 After cutting the lead to five, Bluefield State only made one shot over the final six minutes and turned the ball over five times while Lincoln Memorial iced the game with free throws.
 The redshirt junior, Kiser, who is a Graham High School graduate, scored 17 points for the Railsplitters including a trio of 3-pointers and had four steals on the defensive end.
 Flowers led Lincoln Memorial with 21 points while Proffitt had 18 for the South Atlantic Conference squad, which shot 48.1 percent from the field.
 The Railsplitters got to the free throw line 27 times making 22 of them led by a 10-for-12 showing at the stripe from freshman Kassidy Kenny. She finished with 12 points on the game. The Big Blues only attempted five free throws, making three of them and none after halftime.
 Down 14 points at the start of the fourth quarter, the Big Blues cut the lead down to 64-54 after which they brought a full-court press that forced turnovers on the next four possessions. The Railsplitters turned the ball over 22 times but the Big Blues only converted them into 23 points.
 “We definitely tried to get after it a little bit more, tried to turn them over. We just weren’t successful enough when we got some of those turnovers,” Bailey said.
 Bluefield State shot 42.9 percent from the field against the full-court zone defense of Lincoln Memorial that proved to be difficult to break down even though it was expected. Kiser, Flowers and Kenny each had four steals for the Railsplitters.

Auckland [New Zealand], December 2 (ANI): West Indies and New Zealand will be taking the knee in their two-match Test series to show support towards the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.   New Zealand and West Indies are slated to lock horns in the two-match Test series, with the first match getting underway on Thursday. Both the teams had taken the knee before the start of their T20 matches as well.   "Jason and I caught up; we are looking to continue what was done during the T20s and try to continue that awareness around the BLM movement and also the Give Nothing To Racism campaign that New Zealand Cricket are right behind as well. So that will be continued on the first day of each Test match," ESPNCricinfo quoted New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson as saying.  
 West Indies Test captain Jason Holder also shed light on his conversation with Kane Williamson and said he is happy with the support shown towards BLM by the Kiwis.   "It just shows the kind of individuals that New Zealand cricket has. Kane came openly to me and we sat down and had a really good chat around it. It was just mainly him hearing our side of it. Really happy with his support...and New Zealand Cricket have started a campaign too, which is really good," said Holder.   The West Indies will also sport the BLM logo on the collars of their shirts at Seddon Park.   "Us as individuals, we go around the world, we mingle with so many different people -- you never quite understand what some people go through. The more education we put around it, the better off this world will be," said Holder.   The two-match Test series between West Indies and New Zealand will be a part of the World Test Championship (WTC). If the Kiwis win both the Tests, then the side will topple England from the third spot in the points table. (ANI)
