CREIGHTON — Mrs. Laflan had a place on the main street of our town
 it sits right next to the old bakery, we all knew must come down.
 The bakery sat for years and years no one to bring it up to snuff
 the windows broke the roof fell in and all that awful stuff.
 So now the City has to do the job that now one wants to do

Recently in the US, a police officer was caught on camera kneeling on the neck of George Floyd until he couldn’t breath. Floyd eventually died. I think that is the most shabby crime committed by police I have ever seen.
 However, there has been a series of crimes in America committed by police against Blacks.
 The Floyd incident caught the attention of many people both in the US and other parts of the world hence triggering demos against police brutality.
 Some people even called for disbanding the entire police force while others wanted the federal government to stop funding the Force. As all that was happening, President Donald Trump and his supporters did the opposite, they instead called for defending the police and respecting law and order in their country. This is not because they supported the killings of people, but they considered other good work the police do.      I think the world has created a culture that protestors are always right and even when they break laws, they should be protected. In my view, that is like encouraging savagery.
 The truth is that some times they go overboard by confronting police. Most times even the issues for staging protests do not hold water, but the police ignore since we have pushed them against the wall.

This is the fourth in a series that began with Marilynne Robinson’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel set in Gilead, Iowa, but _Jack_ stands alone as a truly remarkable work of fiction. It's the story of a romance between Jack, the prodigal son of a Presbyterian minister, and Della, a Black high school teacher who is also the child of a minister. Robinson is that rare author who commands me to continue even when I think she is rambling on too much. I soon discover that a paragraph ago I missed one of the important twists in the story. Early in the novel, Della and Jack spend a night together in a cemetery. No sex, only an occasional arm on each other or a sleepy head on a shoulder. Soon I am in that cemetery with them, no matter how much I don't want to be there. As Mark Athitakis, critic from the _Chicago Sun-Times_ , says, “Marilynne Robinson is so powerful a writer that she can reshape how we read.” _— Anita Johnson_

Fox said Matagorda County officials are concerned that Thanksgiving gatherings might cause a spike in numbers.
 “We know that more contact among more people increases the odds of transmission, so it’s reasonable for the MRMC COVID-19 Taskforce and our elected officials to be concerned about a potential spike in new cases,” Fox said. “But we’re hopeful that most gatherings were conducted in a manner consistent with reducing the direct and indirect spread of the virus throughout our community and among our most vulnerable populations.”
 More than 13 million Americans have been infected with COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, and over 266,000 have died, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University.
 And now the area is in the middle of the holiday Christmas season where more and more people are out and about shopping and enjoying the season.
 Thames said residents can take care of themselves if they take heed of the recommendations put out by the CDC from the start of the pandemic.
 “There are no new way to protect ourselves,” Thames said. “There isn’t a pill to take, it will take action. It will mean that we can’t do things the way we have always done them. It will mean we have to change our ways, and continue to protect each other and ourselves. The solution is so simple, maybe too simple. It hasn’t changed, follow the guidelines that have been in news.”
 Fox urged residents to just follow all of the CDC recommendations while shopping this holiday season
 “We can support our local businesses in good conscience when we’re intentional and resolute in our commitment to public health safety measures,” Fox said. “Physical distancing, wearing a face mask when less than 6ft from anyone who does not live in our household, washing our hands thoroughly and often, and protecting our high-risk populations are critical components in ensuring both economic and public health.”

Sai Paranjpye is a legend, there's no two ways about it. The 82-year-old director is responsible for pioneering numerous changes in the film industry and the theatre circuit. With her memoir A Patchwork Quilt, Paranjpye charts her journey that saw her stints at All India Radio in Pune, Film and Television Institute of India, a delightful realisation in Paris to creating some of the most memorable movies known to people in the Hindi film industry."I used to have a very vivid imagination. I guess I was born with it," says Paranjpye, who credits her mother for bringing her up with a love for storytelling. Born to a Russian emigre father and an Indian mother, her grandfather was R. P. Paranjpe, the first Indian senior wrangler at the University of Cambridge. "My mother used to tell bed time stories to put me to sleep. One night, she ran out of them and said, 'you tell me a story', so I did and she said 'that's not so bad, who told them to you?' I said no one, I made it up. Then she didn't believe me and I told her another and another."I used to have a very vivid imagination. I guess I was born with it.Thanks to that nightly tete-a-tete between mother and daughter, what transpired was a collection of stories published under Paranjpye's name when she was all of eight years old. Although, she says, "I had to write every day, three to four pages before I was allowed to play. That bit I hated."A memoir for a reader may be a medium to get a peek into a writer's world, but for the writer, it becomes a portal for revisiting past memories. Pleasant and unpleasant in varying degrees, the director swears by her skill for storytelling and absolutely enjoys writing. "I always say, and I've repeated it in my book, and pardon me if I am being immodest, but I am a first rate writer and a second rate director," she quips.French review captivated me. It was quite like our tamasha. It had the same vibrancy and avant-garde feel to it.As has been the case with numerous artistes, Paris holds a special place in the National Award-winner's life. "When I went to Paris and saw the French review, and that captivated me. It was quite like our tamasha. It had the same vibrancy and avant-garde feel to it. I felt it was a really sophisticated kind of tamasha. I thought of them as twins separated at birth. That's how I introduced Marathi tamasha form in Hindi theatre," she says.One look at her filmography and even those who're unaccustomed can point out films like Sparsh (1980), Chashme Buddoor (1981) and Katha (1982) for the importance attached to them and the legacy they left behind inadvertently. But selecting what to write and what not to, for her, was not as hard. I have mentioned some unpleasant memories, too, how I was taken for a ride by the producers, how I was left with peanuts and the producers made king size profits out of the films."Selecting what to say was not terribly difficult because I began with radio, and I am passionately fond of radio. That's my first love. I never had a moment when I had to sit and scratch my head and say, now what shall I do," she says, adding, "I have mentioned some unpleasant memories, too, how I was taken for a ride by the producers, how I was left with peanuts and the producers made king size profits out of the films. Now when I look back, I do not think I will change anything because I enjoyed the making of these films and the writing their stories and putting it all together. I loved doing it. So, that in a sense, was the reward."

By that time, she was well on her way to the next chapter when at 72 years old she became a paramedic. When she could no longer do that, she helped to found the Latch Key Children with the Matagorda United Methodist Church for children whose parents worked and couldn’t be there when the kids got home from school.
 A life-long Methodist, she embodied the principals of Christianity and “Love your neighbor as yourself” in her actions. Many times, she would give a total stranger, a mother and children or some broke down fisherman, the keys to her truck, a signed check or cash to fix whatever crisis they were in and more than once her kids would say she’d never see that again. But just like her faith in God, her faith in man was rewarded time and again when they’d bring her car back or sometimes months later a letter with a check, thanking her for her kindness. She never complained about her life and if anyone around her did, she would simply start singing, “ Count Your Blessings, name them one by one…Count your Blessings see what God has done”…, or tell you to “brighten the corner where you’re at”. She used the hymns humorously too. When her children would get up after sleeping in, they were serenaded with “Christ our Lord has ‘risen today. Hallelujah!”
 This extraordinary woman lived life to the fullest. She loved and supported her children and their children and on and on. She worked hard and ran several successful businesses and selflessly served her community and her church in so many ways. She will be greatly missed but she lived a full life and embraced life in a way that somehow makes her passing less sad. We celebrate Granny Treybig, as she was known to pretty much everyone, and are so grateful we had her as long as we did.
 She is survived by her son, Buddy and wife Gina Treybig and son, Carson Treybig all of Matagorda, who were her faithful and loving primary caregivers in her later years; grandchildren, Chris Wilson, April Deadrich (Ryan), Katie Sterling (Chris), David Sterling, DeWalt Owens, John Rawlings Jr., Steven Rawlings (Nadine), Angela Baker (Greg), Trey Treybig (Emily), Tyler Treybig (Christina), Annette Williams (Aaron), Marty Warnick (Nikki), Robert Warnick (Ashley), Nancy Slotman (Andy) and Katie Aaron; and many great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren.
 Due to limited space, her funeral service will be for family members only. There will be an opportunity for you to pay your final respects at 10:45 a.m. Saturday, December 5, 2020 at the Matagorda United Methodist Church after her family exits. Graveside services will follow at the Matagorda Cemetery.

Sens. Romney and Mike Lee allowing this bill to advance will adversely affect Utahns in a number of ways.
 Federal tribal recognition isn’t just something for checking a diversity box (just ask Elizabeth Warren). Those who have it have the power to tax, imprison and make laws inside of the state where they reside.
 Utah has many unrecognized groups professing native identity. Each of them has every right to go through the process to establish the truth about their heritage, as do the Lumbees. But setting a precedent that allows individuals with ancestry claims as contentious as the Lumbees’ to sideswipe the government’s full vetting process could destabilize law and order within our borders.
 Compounding the problem for Utah is how many groups with federal recognition desire to construct casinos. This group is of no exception. One member of the group recently said that they are perfectly situated to create one, and the Lumbee Recognition Act would provide them the right to do so.
 Utah does not allow gambling of any form out of moral, communal, security and religious concerns. We recognize the dangers that it can bring to neighborhoods, especially when conducted by the wrong set of hands. But our representatives voting for the Lumbee bill would condone opening the door to the rapid expansion of gaming by any group that has a little money, the right lobbyists and the promise of political benefit.
 If there’s a bill out there that’s more against Utahns’ beliefs and values, I haven’t seen it yet.
 Now is not the time for new lame duck surprises. Now is the time to put the interests of constituents first. Here’s hoping the Utah delegation keeps its priorities straight.

They were dark-skinned, almost ‘purple’ you could say. They came very early most mornings and started rounding us up. My old man woke me up in the wee hours of the morning to hide. He was staying put.
 I run to Michael’s home whence his mother hid us under the bed. We must have dozed off, because it was at about 11am when I felt the cold muzzle of the AK-47 in my ribs and heard Michael’s mother shouting and pleading to the soldiers not to kill her children.
 We were forcefully ejected from under the bed and frogmarched to the Stella Bar collection point on Entebbe Road.
 There was an army truck which we boarded and it soon took off for Kibuli where allegedly they had rebel ‘computers’ who would identify the rebels amongst us. As we boarded the lorry, there was a soldier who was smoking.
 I saw him eying Michael and in the blink of an eye he had extinguished his cigarette on Michael’s handsome face. Michael winced in pain.
 I must have peed in my pants. Michael never really recovered from that humiliating incident. He took to alcohol and lost his self-esteem. I could see he was a broken lawyer.
 And that’s how the animosity started. They imprisoned our people, maimed them and killed many. They were the government. Still, there were a few good men who spoke up like the Cardinal.
 These too were sometimes rounded up and we never heard about them. The soldiers (and rebels) raided homes, killed our parents and stole whatever they could take. The good men and women were now very afraid to speak up. All of these activities were in the name of propping up the Obote ll regime.
 Inevitably, the regime fell and we got a new set of liberators. By this time, I was finishing campus and joined the government soon thereafter. We had been liberated, or so we thought.
 Thirty five odd years later, we see the men who ‘liberated’ us, abusing, maiming and shooting the children of the kids they liberated.
 And again the ‘good’ men have gone silent. We see and know who is behind the election violence. But none of us seems bold enough to speak up. It is complicated because some of those maiming and killing are our relatives.
 When violence starts, truth is the first victim. I do remember the late Paulo Muwanga’s word - ensi egulwa mirambo. That was before the Human Rights Commission, when he was trying to explain the loss of sanity in our society.
 But it is not too late. It is time, if there are some good men and women still standing, to say enough is enough. There is no need for this violence. This is our country and we can all live here! Stand up and be counted.

 # Man accused of public sex act in Forsythe Park says he was looking for new dating partner
 Bonnie Bolden
 Monroe News-Star
 A Rayville man is accused of engaging in a public sex at in Forsythe Park in Monroe.
 Caleb Dillard, 27, was booked into Ouachita Correctional Center around 11:30 p.m. Friday.
 Deputies with the Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Office Special Crimes Apprehension Team saw a white man, wearing no pants, masturbating in front of a Nissan Cube around 11 p.m. Friday.
 Multiple people were in eyesight as the man continued to touch himself.
 Deputies contacted the man and identified themselves. According to the arrest report, he said," you are not real cops, that badge is fake," got in the driver's seat of the Cube and began to flee in the vehicle.
 Deputies used lights and sirens to initiate a traffic stop, and the man continued to flee, reaching speeds in excess of 80 mph in residential neighborhoods, forcing multiple vehicles off the road.
 After multiple blocks of pursuit, the vehicle stopped. Deputies ordered that the man get out of the Cube, and he refused. Ultimately, they removed him from his vehicle by force.
 They attempted to place him in restraints, and at this time, he put on inside- out blue jeans. Dillard pulled away as deputies attempted to place him in restraints.
 After being advised of his Miranda rights, Dillard reportedly told deputies, "I was at the park masturbating in order to find a new dating partner."
 Deputies searched Dillard and asked if he had any illegal items on him, and he reportedly said no. At OCC, a search revealed 2 grams of suspected methamphetamine in his pants pocket.
 Dillard was charged with felony counts of obscenity, aggravated flight from an officer, possession of a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance and introducing contraband to penal institutions. He also was charged with a misdemeanor count of resisting an officer.
 Bond has not yet been set.

"Il prestito aveva un valore di 3 milioni, mentre il riscatto di 16 milioni suddivisi in due anni. Un contratto pre-Covid assolutamente gradito a tutte le parti, infatti non è mai stato un vero problema e lo conferma il fatto he oggi non c'è più questa clausola dell'obbligo di riscatto. La Fiorentina mi ha detto che i tecnici non avevano mai avuto indicazioni in tal senso dalla società, ma ultimamente mi sono sorti molti dubbi, i numeri lo confermano: Cutrone infatti ha giocato una media di 16 minuti a partita. Mi sembra strano che in un reparto dove si fatica tanto a segnare non possa esserci spazio".

Finally, to my parliamentary colleagues from all walks of political thought, I suspect there’ll be times when we glance across the room and connect unexpectedly on a value that brings all of us to this place. We have a collective obligation to nurture that. While the reality of politics is our corners and a three-year term—at least for now—the truth of sustainable and significant change requires that we hold on to those moments of connection and construct some political scaffolding around the values and ideas we all need to take root and to grow for Aotearoa.Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.

Sita Arya, 34, who is part of the farmers' protest at the Ghazipur border, wakes up at 4 am and walks nearly two kilometres to use a public lavatory. This has been her routine for the past few days as there are no clean facilities available at the demonstration site.
 "If we use toilets at the protest site, if not of the coronavirus, we will die due to the unhygienic conditions of the toilets," Sita, who hails from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, said, citing instances where women were forced to defecate in the open.
 Sita, who is herself a farmer, is among 50 other women from various parts of UP who have been camping at the border for the last five days along with their male counterparts as part of the protest against the Centre's new farm laws.The uncleaned temporary toilets have forced the protesting women to either use empty plots or agriculture fields nearby.
 The women protestors complained that even though temporary toilets have been set up by the authorities at the border, none of them can be used as they are in a very unhygienic condition and stink because there is no facility to clean them after usage.This has compelled Sita to wake up early morning daily just to use a toilet.
   
   
 She along with two other women walk around two kilometres from the protest site and pay Rs five to use the toilet and Rs 10 to take a bath there.
 The protesting woman said unhygienic toilets and defecating in the open are not the only problems, their safety is also a big concern. They are compelled to spend sleepless night under the flyover, another woman protester said. "Our safety is in our hands," said the women, who take turns to sleep in the night. They said at least three women stay awake all night to ensure that the group of women can sleep in peace.
 "We take turns to sleep at night. We have to look out for our own safety. Since we are under the open, we need to stay extra vigilant especially at night because any outsider can enter the area. "So we take turns to sleep," said Seema, another protestor, who has left her two young children back home at her village to participate in the protest.
 Forty-year-old Jayanti, who along with her husband came from Shahjahanpur district said, "We will continue to protest here until our demands our met. We don't have proper sanitization facilities, lack hygienic toilets, no space to change clothes but still we are ready to fight our battle."
 Sita said the woman have no other option than walking through the empty road early morning to use the toilet. She said "Are we even left with any option? I sit for 'havan' here and without taking a bath, I cannot perform the rituals. "We don't have bathing facilities and the temporary toilets set up here are so unhygienic that once used, it cannot be used again because it is not being cleaned on a regular basis."
 Recalling an incident where a woman had to defecate in an empty plot due to uncleaned toilets, Sita said "Yesterday afternoon, one of our women wanted to go to the toilet. But when she went to the jungle area behind, a man came there and she had to run from there. This is how unsafe it is for women and then our Prime Minister has given the call of 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao'.

Utah has a higher COVID-19 infection rate than nearly any other state in the nation. Its small businesses are preparing for another shutdown that would affect their already fragile bottom lines. Congress shouldn’t ignore these concerns. To protect their interests, it should work toward passing ample relief, like extending the Utah-first tax extenders for Medicare, Medicaid, and the CARES Act that will expire by the year’s end. Unfortunately, many members appear too pre-occupied with entertaining legislative giveaways to care.
 This lame duck largesse isn’t just a distraction from addressing real problems facing the Beehive State. These giveaways will also create their own set of vulnerabilities for those that live here.
 Take, for example, the Lumbee Recognition Act. This legislation, which recently passed the House of Representatives and may soon receive a roll call vote in the Senate, is an example of everything that’s wrong with Washington.
 The bill will have Congress spend nearly a billion dollars to provide federal Native American recognition for a group that calls itself the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina.
 The legitimacy of the Lumbee “tribe” has long been in contention. Congress has declined to pass this legislation many times over the decades over concerns regarding their authenticity and their refusal to go through the full government process that exists to vet recognition claims. Critics point out that they have never had a treaty with the United States, a reservation, or a claim before the Indian Claims Commission. They don’t speak an indigenous language and one genealogist just calls their tribal status “invented.”

In a recent interview with CNN’s David Axelrod, Sen. Mitt Romney said, “The consequences of what’s happening during this lame duck period … are potentially more severe than the consequences associated with a late transition process.” Romney may have been talking in another context; nevertheless, the fear of lame duck legislation has grown greater than ever.
 “Lame duck” is the period between November elections and the start of the next legislative session. When it works well, politicians make good on their campaign promises to the American people. When it doesn’t, they dole out election favors to donors and lobbyists, putting the concerns of special interests above those of taxpayers and consumers. Unfortunately for Utahns, this year’s appears to feature more of the latter than the former.
 It’s a shame because state residents are counting on their legislators to protect their interests now more than ever.

The Uganda Police Force has a basic role of keeping law and order. This means they should be the first institution any one should run to in case of a problem. It should be an institution to pride in when it comes to upholding the laws of the land.
 Second, I understand order means providing a conducive state to everyone be it in their homes, workplace, public places, and so forth. Presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, on Wednesday presented his complaint to the Electoral Commission, a body which is mandated to manage elections in the country.
 And from the issues he raised, it was clear that we no longer observe the rule of law in this country. Mr Kyagulanyi, gave as evidence, pictures of people who were shot at, talked of a teargas canister lobbed into the car he was in, and also his supporter, who was injured to the extent of losing a tooth.
 I have of recent listened to some concerned citizens who say Uganda comes first before any political party or elections. I believe we should embrace such reasonable idea. It should be shameful to police when people seek “law and order” from other institutions such as the Electoral Commission.
 People should be running to police for protection of their lives and property and not the other way round. It is wrong for police to fire live bullets or teargas canisters at people. A security body being reported for causing insecurity is a sign of institutional failure. Police should strive to do the right thing.

Students who need Chromebooks or Wi-Fi hotspots will have those issued to them beginning Monday, Dec. 7. Campus administrators will be coordinating the distribution of technology devices to the students as needed. Tidehaven ISD is fully prepared to move to the online learning platform and provide our students with a quality education as we weather the recent rise in Covid cases.
 Tidehaven ISD has taken this step out of a genuine concern for the safety of our students and staff, and we appreciate the support of our students and parents.
 Final exams for secondary students are cancelled. Teachers may choose to give the semester exam to help students learn the material but a grade will not be recorded for the final exams for secondary students.
 “We ask that parents please communicate with their child’s teacher if you have any questions,” Siegrist said. “All teachers will be communicating with their classes on how they will be providing lessons through the online platforms and so all students should be fully aware of how classes will be conducted. This is a planned transition to the online platform, and we are moving forward with a great deal of careful thought and planning for this transition period. We will resume normal school operations with face to face instruction on Tuesday, Jan. 5th, 2021.”
 “To Go” Lunches will be prepared and served Dec. 14-16 out of the Markham and Blessing campuses as we have done in the past.

TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - As of 10 p.m. December 4th, Tucson’s mandatory curfew went into effect.Mayor and Council approved the 10 p.m.- 5 a.m. curfew on Wednesday, which was originally presented as an 8 p.m.- 5 a.m. curfew.If you’re caught out after the curfew, you will be given a warning first and then if you continue to not comply, you can face a fine of $300. Those going to and from work, caring for others, or taking part in essential activities are exempt.The curfew does not require businesses to close early, however, some businesses are deciding to anyway.“We’re out of here, we have to be home by 10,” said Samantha Gross, an employee at Amy’s Donuts. “We are going to be closing our doors at 7pm no exceptions, we will be doing drive thru until 9pm.”The shop normally stays open until midnight, but decided to air on the side of safety despite losing those busy late-night hours.″I think a lot of people were sad, but they understand for the most part,” said Gross.Closing up shop a few hours early is not a cure-all. The Pima County Health Department said they’d rather have people not be out at all if it’s not essential.“We don’t want to mislead the public that in and of itself that is sufficient. We encourage people to do the voluntary shelter in place and at this point at least in Tucson the mandatory curfew,” said Dr. Theresa Cullen, PCHD Director.During their press conference Friday, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Francisco Garcia said he knows there are some who don’t agree with the curfew, but hopes their numbers are few.“We have to appeal to people’s best instinct and their social mindedness so hopefully that appeal gets through to most folks,” said Dr. Garcia.So having a business like Amy’s Donuts comply is a start. And they’re on board until the curfew is lifted. As they hope it helps bring all of this to an end.″I hope we can just get this over with and we can all get back to normal,” said Gross.Copyright 2020 KOLD News 13. All rights reserved.

Over the past decades, food supply chains have grown increasingly complex and many of today’s food products repeatedly cross national boundaries, creating more opportunities for criminals to practise food fraud.
 Consider this. An average cod can travel 10,000 miles before it ends up on a dinner plate. It may be caught in the Bering Sea, then prepared and frozen in a factory in eastern China, taken by cargo ship for processing in Europe or the US, and undergo one final journey before ending up as, say, a fish finger on a plate in Uganda. The farm-to-fork journey has involved a lot of hands, with a lot of opportunity for criminals to step in and exploit weak links in the chain.
 Along with a growing global population – and as the world becomes ever more complex and interconnected – there is a clear, urgent and compelling need to standardise regulations on an international level.
 Food fraud has become more sophisticated and harder to detect, presenting regulators with an even bigger challenge. The scale of the challenge is huge.
 Supermarkets stock thousands of different food products, and smaller food businesses do not have the resources to “police” their supply chains.
 With a growing pressure to produce affordable food, there is increasing temptation to cut corners on health, safety and quality controls, which in turn puts more pressure on government and food regulators.
 A certification body like Unbs plays a critical role in efforts to improve the safety of food systems. Food certification promises higher standards and transparency, and an effective weapon in tackling food fraud. The Food Safety Management System certification scheme helps companies to produce safe food and gain the trust of customers.
 These standards are designed to provide companies in the food industry with an internationally recognised certification.
 Of course, any conversation on food safety and food fraud has to include the consumer. The role that consumers play is a big issue.
 While standards help manufacturers ensure food safety and uses traceability to guarantee the origin of food ingredients, consumers bear some responsibility for safety after purchase if they fail to handle food properly by allowing cross-contamination and poor hygienic practices and ignoring advice from manufacturers.
 The responsibility of food safety should not be left entirely to Unbs alone, better consumer education and knowledge are key. One challenge for many consumers is understanding the basics of handling food safely at home.

but if you’re really really hungry its like playing hide and seek.
 There ain’t no pun intended but the food truck sure looks sandwiched in
 I wonder if there was a plan before the work began.

Sita Arya, 34, who is part of the farmers' protest at the Ghazipur border, wakes up at 4 am and walks nearly two kilometres to use a public lavatory. This has been her routine for the past few days as there are no clean facilities available at the demonstration site."If we use toilets at the protest site, if not of the coronavirus, we will die due to the unhygienic conditions of the toilets," Sita, who hails from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, said, citing instances where women were forced to defecate in the open. Sita, who is herself a farmer, is among 50 other women from various parts of UP who have been camping at the border for the last five days along with their male counterparts as part of the protest against the Centre's new farm laws.The uncleaned temporary toilets have forced the protesting women to either use empty plots or agriculture fields nearby. The women protestors complained that even though temporary toilets have been set up by the authorities at the border, none of them can be used as they are in a very unhygienic condition and stink because there is no facility to clean them after usage.This has compelled Sita to wake up early morning daily just to use a toilet.She along with two other women walk around two kilometres from the protest site and pay Rs five to use the toilet and Rs 10 to take a bath there.The protesting woman said unhygienic toilets and defecating in the open are not the only problems, their safety is also a big concern. They are compelled to spend sleepless night under the flyover, another woman protester said. "Our safety is in our hands," said the women, who take turns to sleep in the night. They said at least three women stay awake all night to ensure that the group of women can sleep in peace."We take turns to sleep at night. We have to look out for our own safety. Since we are under the open, we need to stay extra vigilant especially at night because any outsider can enter the area. "So we take turns to sleep," said Seema, another protestor, who has left her two young children back home at her village to participate in the protest.Forty-year-old Jayanti, who along with her husband came from Shahjahanpur district said, "We will continue to protest here until our demands our met. We don't have proper sanitization facilities, lack hygienic toilets, no space to change clothes but still we are ready to fight our battle." Sita said the woman have no other option than walking through the empty road early morning to use the toilet. She said "Are we even left with any option? I sit for 'havan' here and without taking a bath, I cannot perform the rituals. "We don't have bathing facilities and the temporary toilets set up here are so unhygienic that once used, it cannot be used again because it is not being cleaned on a regular basis." Recalling an incident where a woman had to defecate in an empty plot due to uncleaned toilets, Sita said "Yesterday afternoon, one of our women wanted to go to the toilet. But when she went to the jungle area behind, a man came there and she had to run from there. This is how unsafe it is for women and then our Prime Minister has given the call of 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao'.
