_Torino, 07 lug 15:04 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- I Servizi Sanitari Nazionali costituiscono i capisaldi essenziali delle comunità, ma le strutture da sole non basterebbero senza l’umanità e la responsabilità di chi vi opera. A nome del Consiglio regionale, poi, voglio anche esprimere un profondo ringraziamento a tutti i cittadini che durante il periodo più rischioso, hanno continuato a operare, dai farmacisti, agli addetti alle vendite di prodotti essenziali, da chi ha lavorato nella logistica alle forze dell’ordine che hanno lavorato sempre, ogni giorno, nell’interesse della collettività”. I primi a ricevere l’onorificenza saranno appunto gli operatori sanitari piemontesi e, con una certa urgenza, su proposta del capogruppo Luv Marco Grimaldi, i 38 della “Brigada Henry Reeve” (21 medici e 16 infermieri), destinata dal Ministero della Salute di Cuba al Piemonte e impegnata nell’ospedale temporaneo delle OGR, che domenica faranno ritorno in patria.

Dubbed "the greatest sports fix of the pandemic" by Mashable’s Kellen Beck, _The Last Dance_ landed at just the right time for those missing games canceled due to lockdown. "Part gift to sports fans with nothing to watch and part attempt to boost ratings during a content drought, _The Last Dance_ has become a haven of normalcy to large swaths of the world who feel lost without sports," reads the review. Tracking the formidable career of Michael Jordan and particularly his last season with the Chicago Bulls in 1997-98, the 10-part miniseries is compelling viewing even for sports n00bs like me. Directed by Jason Hehir and co-produced by ESPN Films and Netflix, _The Last Dance_ blends footage from an NBA Entertainment crew who was allowed to follow the team around for that season, and interviews with former teammates, coaches, managers, and people close to them.

"Whether it's a shirt or a shoe or a hair bobble -- she's always got something in her hair -- she picks one thing and that inspires her outfit for the day and she coordinates around it. It's artsy, it's colorful and it's bold. And she's bold. She has a lot of self-confidence because don't we all wish we could just dress like her? Momona [Tamada] brings a real physicality to the character as well. She's a petite little thing, so we layer her and she isn't overwhelmed by the clothes. We had small tricks, like rolling her pants up to cuff level so we saw more of her ankles. She always had jewelry and it was always big, beautiful, bright and unique looking. It was a lot of jewelry from a company called Konplott, and a lot of vintage jewelry that we mixed in with the new. Her look in a nutshell is unique. Momona was a good four inches shorter than the rest of the girls, so we wanted to use the platform sneakers to give her some height -- and she has the big bun for that reason."

  “Michael is a wise and thoughtful leader, never afraid to do the right thing at the right time," said Kim A. Wilcox, UC Riverside’s chancellor, who served with Drake on the board of the University Innovation Alliance, a group of 11 public universities working to improve college access for low-income students, first-generation students, and students of color.


  Drake takes the helm as the state budget cuts more than $470 million from the UC system, and many campuses have already announced plans for mostly online instruction in the fall.


  “I am confident that Dr. Drake is the leader we need to guide our world-class higher education system through this time of unprecedented challenge," Gov. Gavin Newsom said.


  The announcement also comes as the California State University system is searching for a new leader. President Timothy White announced he would retire in June, but delayed his departure until the fall because of the pandemic.

“It’s been an effort of the whole city,” Maltbie said. “The mayor has come and helped us pull carpet up and haul it off. It’s just been a little bit of everybody here… We weren’t as pushed to hurry and open as we would have been without the shutdowns. It kind of gave us a little time to sit back and say, ‘Hey, let’s not rush this.’”


  Matlbie said the museum plans to house its more formal displays in the front section of the building, which has its entrance on 101 West Main Street, and use the open area of the back section for its larger exhibits that it hadn’t had the room to display in the past.


  “We got some bigger things,” he said, “like an 1840s or 50s weaving loom that they weaved wide cloth with. It’s probably 4-feet wide, 8 feet long; we’ll have room to set it up… We’ll be able to display more large things like that and hopefully come up with some more large stuff.”


  A new bathroom has already been added in the back section of the building and the museum plans to add an general-use activity room for its events and public use. There will also be a records library where anyone can request information on historical topics and pour through the museum’s records.


  “Say you came in [and asked], ‘What do you have on the [a specific] family?’” he said. “We can go back there and pull a folder out, let you have it and you can go back there and sit and read about what we have here. We’ll also have all of our yearbooks and all the history books we have. So, we’re going to have quite a bit of history that is available for in-house reading… We’re pretty excited about that area also.”


  Although he’s proud of the progress they’ve made on the new museum building, which the city reportedly purchased for close to $120,000, Maltibe said there’s more work to be done. The museum hasn’t set a date yet for when they hope to have its grand opening.


  “This building here, I wish we had taken before and after pictures,” Maltbie said. “We have a few but not you wouldn’t believe the difference in this building. It just amazes me, but we still got a long way to go.”

Zoe never took offense.


  Her life story is that of any good family dog. Long walks. Fun times romping in the snow. Ample barking at delivery people and passing dogs.


  In her later years she developed a strange relationship with a rabbit living in our backyard.


  They seemed to have reached a non-aggression pact that gave the rabbit unfettered access to all grass and plants while still allowing Zoe to occasionally save face by chasing the rabbit for about 6 feet before giving up and pretending she had better things to do.


  Whatever ancestral wolf DNA she possessed had been fully overwhelmed by laziness or a tender heart, or possibly both.


  And that was fine. We had no need for a wolf. All we needed was Zoe.


  And that’s what’s amazing about the creatures we’re lucky enough to have in our lives. They are, wholly and completely, themselves. Sure, we train them and help them adapt to our ways of living. But they train us to understand and appreciate them as beings unencumbered by the annoying complexities of humanness.


  That’s what binds us so tightly, I think. Zoe’s inherent goodness made the people who loved her better by helping us see that her way of living — Love people! Love playing! Love food! — almost always made more sense than our own.


  That’s a gift, one that remains long after our noble beasts have gone.


  And it’s worth it. Even for the pain that comes on a hot July day, when you look at your friend and writing partner and know it’s time for her to go. And you hold her as her sweet soul leaves her body, and the humans left behind cry so hard their faces hurt.


  It’s worth it, pain and tears and all.


  My arm feels lighter as I write this, and notably less draped in slobber. There isn’t a bark when the doorbell rings, and there’s a 95-pound space in our family that won’t be easily filled.


  We don’t deserve dogs. But we have them.


  For that, I’m forever grateful.

The Ryder Cup will be postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to an ESPN report published Tuesday night.


  The network reported that an official announcement to postpone the tournament will come Wednesday morning from PGA of America and the European Tour. The Presidents Cup subsequently will be pushed back to 2022 as the events remain on track to alternate every other year.


  The Guardian of London reported the postponement two weeks ago, but no announcement has been made.


  This year's Ryder Cup had been slated to take place from Sept. 25-27 at Whistling Straits Golf Course in Kohler, Wis. The course has held three PGA championships in 2004, 2010 and 2015, with Jason Day claiming the most recent victory.


  Rumours have swirled for months that the Ryder Cup could be cancelled or postponed. The event was set to include Steve Stricker as captain of the U.S. team and Padraig Harrington as captain of the European team.


  Golfers including Paul Casey said the Ryder Cup would not have been the same if fans were kept out.


  "I want a Ryder Cup with full capacity," Casey, of England, said earlier this summer. "I want it with screaming fans. I saw the headlines. …


  "Even as a European, knowing how loud that would be for the American team, that's what I want. We want to play a Ryder Cup in that environment, in that cauldron, and (postponing) is the right thing to do."


  Rory McIlroy also expressed recent concern about participating in the event.


  "The players are the ones that make the Ryder Cup," he said. "If they are not on board with it and don't want to play then there is no Ryder Cup. I see it being pushed back until 2021, and, honestly, I think that will be the right call."


  The Ryder Cup has been interrupted five times previously by global events. It did not take place from 1939 through 1945, spanning four tournaments, because of World War II. The event also was pushed back a year because of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.


  With future editions moving to odd-numbered years, the 2022 event, scheduled for Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Rome, would be moved to 2023. The next U.S. home series after Whistling Straits would occur in 2025 at Bethpage Black in Farmingdale, N.Y. The 2026 event, set for Adare Manor in Ireland, would instead be held in 2027 -- the year of the Ryder Cup's 100th anniversary.

Hofer was golfing in St. George on a cloudy day when it suddenly started hailing. "We were sitting in our golf carts and thinking, 'Oh, this is interesting. This never happens,'" said Hofer, then 38.
 He was on the green when a bolt of lightning struck his back, exiting through his lower extremities and shoes. He remembers an unusual sensation as if he were "frozen in time" during the strike, as well as a smell he likens to burning rubber.
 "The feeling is just incapacitating. It hits you and you can't move, you can't scream, you can't think," he says. "I remember that energy, and I remember falling to the ground."
 Witnesses told him he was conscious for about seven minutes before falling out of consciousness, blood coming out his mouth, ears and burn wounds. He was quickly transported to the Las Vegas hospital.
 "I just remember being perplexed," Hofer says. "It seemed like that was weeks ago that I was golfing with those guys, but then I didn't have any memories in between that, and there I was."

 His condition has improved, but he says he still experiences bouts of nerve pain in certain areas of his lower back, and his left leg and foot remain partially numb.
 "It's definitely something that affects you for the rest of your life," Hofer said. "It's kind of your new normal."
 Lightning strikes cause neurological injuries, Cooper says. As a result, victims most commonly deal with chronic pain symptoms due to nerve damage, along with impacts to the brain comparable to post-concussive syndrome in football players. Memory deficits, learning problems, irritability and distractibility are common, she says.
 "Eventually, many, many people get to the acceptance level," Cooper says. "They say, 'I know I got this, but I can take care of it.' I think those are the people that get better. They accept it; they work with the limitations."
 Copeland, then 23, had relatively manageable physical impacts right after she was struck while rock climbing near Devil's Head Mountain south of Denver on June 29, 2019. Immediately after the strike, she felt "numb and fuzzy" but experienced hardly any pain.
 "Everything went white and I remember the universe being so incredibly loud, like the sound of standing next to a train and a city of screaming people," she says.
 She was treated with steroids and has been giving her injured wrist plenty of rest. But she still suffers from severe anxiety that's most acute during thunderstorms.
 "I've had nightmares. For several months after, I would sometimes see flashes of white light randomly," Copeland says. "Occasionally when I blink or something moves quickly (through) my peripherals, I will still see these blinding flashes."
 Hofer continues to experience bouts of chronic pain and fatigue after prolonged activity, along with what he calls an "irrational fear of weather" and PTSD-like symptoms, particularly during storms. His eyesight is different, too. Sometimes images "linger" in his frame of vision longer than they should, he says.

Most of the budget cuts that Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan has proposed for the Police Department were identified in response to the coronavirus pandemic — before Black Lives Matter protests surged in the city — rather than in response to police defunding demands made by protesters.


  But City Council members will meet Wednesday to continue dissecting the Police Department's budget and discussing additional cuts they could make.


  Durkan proposed about $20 million in cuts to the Police Department last month, among other changes to Seattle's 2020 budget that she said would address unexpected city spending related to COVID-19, account for diminished tax revenues during the economic shutdown and combat racial inequity.


  Many protesters and organizations, including endorsers of the Decriminalize Seattle campaign, have demanded that 50% of the Police Department's budget be redirected as soon as possible to other community needs, citing police killings of Black people and institutional racism.


  Durkan has asked staff to research by the end of July what cuts of 20%, 30% and 50% would look like as she develops a 2021 budget proposal and has vowed to solicit input from community members.


  In the meantime, the $20 million in cuts proposed by the mayor for this year amount to about 5% of the Police Department's $409 million 2020 budget (about $195 million has been spent so far). But a closer look at the potential cuts reveals a more complicated picture.

The retiring of Mississippi's state flag leaves three others that have obvious ties to Confederate banners - and Florida's is one of them.


   


  You may not have paid much attention to what Florida's flag looks like. Do a Google image search. Wikipedia displays the flags of all 50 states plus former flags no longer in use. Notice those of Florida, Alabama and Georgia. And then (separate search) take a look at the various flag designs of the Confederate States of America.


   


  There were three Confederate flags. The 1861 one had three horizontal stripes -- red, white, red -- and, in the upper left, white stars representing the seceded states in a circle on a blue square field. The 1863 version was white with a red square in the upper left bearing 13 white stars on two blue diagonal stripes forming an "X" (it's called a saltire). The 1865 one added a wide vertical red stripe at the right.


   


  A separate Confederate battle flag consisting entirely of a rectangular version of the saltire square is the one commonly displayed as "the Confederate flag" today.


   


  The battle flag became a part of Mississippi's flag in 1894; the people of Mississippi voted in 2001 to keep the design. On June 28 the state legislature voted to replace it.


   


  Georgia's current flag is its seventh. In a 1956 version, the Confederate battle flag occupied two-thirds of the field. In 2003, the state brought back an earlier Confederate flag-based design.


   


  Alabama's flag -- just a red saltire on a white field -- has been in place since 1895.


   


  Florida's original flag, adopted in 1868, was plain white with the state seal depicting an indigenous woman, a colonial ship, tropical flora and the words "In God we trust." In 1887 the seal was superimposed over the red saltire, with the words "Great Seal of the State of Florida" added. Adopted by popular referendum in 1900, this flag had minor changes to the seal in 1985.


   


  Florida's 1889-93 governor, Francis Philip Fleming, a onetime officer in the Confederate army, was a segregationist who signed into law poll taxes and "literacy" tests designed to restrict the voting rights of Blacks. Research indicates that he proposed adding the red saltire to distinguish the mostly white Florida flag from a flag of "surrender."


   


  To many it seems pretty clear that the red saltire added to the Florida flag was inspired by the blue ones of the Confederacy banners. Maybe that was not the case, but the point is, many believe it was -- and still is. When you look at the Florida and Alabama flags and the Confederate battle flag, they look a lot alike.


   


  The Confederate battle flag is widely regarded as a symbol of racism and white supremacy. Widespread protests and demonstrations have led to its removal in many public places.


   


  If that flag is not acceptable as a symbol in our nation today, how can a flag almost certainly inspired by it be acceptable in our state?

“We have some guys who are seeing their first experience (at this level),” Howe said. “It’s a tough spot and nervous spot. Overall, we played pretty well. There were a couple unlucky breaks that hurt us.”


  The first few innings of Tuesday’s game flew by as Manchester starting pitcher Jack Lane, an Arlington alumnus who plays for Castleton, and Rutland starter Griff Briggs, who will attend Arlington this fall, matched each other pitch for pitch.


  Briggs came in confident, having no-hit Bennington last week on the road. That confidence carried over as he handled a tough Manchester lineup filled with kids he’s used to playing with in the Northshire.


  “(Griff) is a competitor. He wants to force the batters to hit his best stuff, which I love as a coach,” Howe said. “I thought he pitched a great game. He could have gone longer, but we have a long week of games.”


  Briggs hadn’t allowed any hits heading the fourth inning, where he finally ran into trouble. Coleman Reece’s lead-off single eventually led to Manchester’s first run on a Morgantini run batted in and two more runs came across on sacrifice flies by Senecal and Lane.


  Lane looked sharp for Manchester all night long on the bump. The only inning to give him trouble was the sixth.


  Jonah Boyea singled and Braden Carleton doubled to put Rutland in business. An error and a walk later, Josh Beayon knocked in two with hard hit single. Briggs also had a RBI in the sixth on a sacrifice fly.


  “I talk to them all the time about staying aggressive and hitting strikes,” Howe said. “We try not to fall behind in the count and we took advantage of some opportunities. In that inning, we had some really good at-bats and those wear a pitcher down.”


  Beayon was the only Rutland player with multiple hits, as he also cranked a triple in the fourth inning. It looked like Rutland would score its first run there, but a beautiful relay and close play at the plate got Aker out.


  Rutland drops to 1-3 and travels to White River Junction Wednesday for a matchup at Maxfield Sports Complex.

The U.S. stock market has been churning over the last month, with big daily moves up and down keeping it roughly in place. It's been a small-scale version of the market's movements since the start of the year, when a nearly 34% plunge on worries about the pandemic-caused recession quickly gave way to a tremendous rally that brought the S&P 500 nearly back to its record level.

Coleman has had a substantial campaign dollar advantage over Moore and the entire field running for this open seat. However, Moore has received a $550,000 gift from an innocuous Washington political action committee that has pummeled Coleman with negative ads. This contribution may make this race close.


  The 1st District Mobile/Baldwin area seat is also up for grabs, literally. This is the seat open by the departure of Bradley Byrne, who opted to run for the U.S. Senate. The two aspirants who wound up in the runoff, are veteran Mobile County Commissioner and businessman Jerry Carl and former Mobile State Senator Bill Hightower. They finished in a dead heat with Carl getting 39% and Hightower 38% of the vote on March 3. This one will be close and interesting. My guess is that Jerry Carl wins this runoff. He received some late important endorsements in the waning days.


  The marquee event will be the GOP runoff for the U.S. Senate between former Senator Jeff Sessions who sat in this seat for 20 years and former Auburn football coach, Tommy Tuberville. This one will also be close. The two conservative gentlemen finished in a virtual tie on March 3.


  The winner may be the one who took the best advantage of the three-and-a- half-month hiatus. They each could have and should have simply used the phone to call every single potential Republican voter in the state.

The retiring of Mississippi's state flag leaves three others that have obvious ties to Confederate banners - and Florida's is one of them.


   


  You may not have paid much attention to what Florida's flag looks like. Do a Google image search. Wikipedia displays the flags of all 50 states plus former flags no longer in use. Notice those of Florida, Alabama and Georgia. And then (separate search) take a look at the various flag designs of the Confederate States of America.


   


  There were three Confederate flags. The 1861 one had three horizontal stripes -- red, white, red -- and, in the upper left, white stars representing the seceded states in a circle on a blue square field. The 1863 version was white with a red square in the upper left bearing 13 white stars on two blue diagonal stripes forming an "X" (it's called a saltire). The 1865 one added a wide vertical red stripe at the right.


   


  A separate Confederate battle flag consisting entirely of a rectangular version of the saltire square is the one commonly displayed as "the Confederate flag" today.


   


  The battle flag became a part of Mississippi's flag in 1894; the people of Mississippi voted in 2001 to keep the design. On June 28 the state legislature voted to replace it.


   


  Georgia's current flag is its seventh. In a 1956 version, the Confederate battle flag occupied two-thirds of the field. In 2003, the state brought back an earlier Confederate flag-based design.


   


  Alabama's flag -- just a red saltire on a white field -- has been in place since 1895.


   


  Florida's original flag, adopted in 1868, was plain white with the state seal depicting an indigenous woman, a colonial ship, tropical flora and the words "In God we trust." In 1887 the seal was superimposed over the red saltire, with the words "Great Seal of the State of Florida" added. Adopted by popular referendum in 1900, this flag had minor changes to the seal in 1985.


   


  Florida's 1889-93 governor, Francis Philip Fleming, a onetime officer in the Confederate army, was a segregationist who signed into law poll taxes and "literacy" tests designed to restrict the voting rights of Blacks. Research indicates that he proposed adding the red saltire to distinguish the mostly white Florida flag from a flag of "surrender."


   


  To many it seems pretty clear that the red saltire added to the Florida flag was inspired by the blue ones of the Confederacy banners. Maybe that was not the case, but the point is, many believe it was -- and still is. When you look at the Florida and Alabama flags and the Confederate battle flag, they look a lot alike.


   


  The Confederate battle flag is widely regarded as a symbol of racism and white supremacy. Widespread protests and demonstrations have led to its removal in many public places.


   


  If that flag is not acceptable as a symbol in our nation today, how can a flag almost certainly inspired by it be acceptable in our state?
