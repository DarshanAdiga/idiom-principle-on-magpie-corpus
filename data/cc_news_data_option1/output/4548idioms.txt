Thanks, Rich. Harry, sorry. It's Frank here. Yeah. Of course we don't yet break out the water utility segment as a stand-alone and you have some of the optimization and holding company costs in there, but the primary driver quarter-over-quarter was the acquisition of the additional Washington and Texas assets that we announced earlier. So that was the driver. I think that we're, we haven't announced any more acquisitions from that point. So what you're seeing there year-to-date is pretty good representation of what's going on. Third quarter is a good quarter for the water business, it's a high usage period, so the year-to-date number in there is representative, I think. There has been a little bit of softening year-over-year on some of the optimization as well and we always because business development cost kind of can go up and down depending on the level of activities we'll see a little bit of volatility in there.

The Notorious B.I.G. was shot to death in 1997 at 24 and in a few years became one of the top voices in rap and pop. He was inducted by close friend and collaborator Diddy.
 "Nobody has come close to the way Biggie sounds, to the way he raps, to the frequency that he hits. Tonight, we are inducting the greatest rapper of all- time," Diddy said.
 Nas said B.I.G. "represents Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, New York City, America, the world and he represents the Black experience." Jay-Z recalled when B.I.G. sent him a demo of "Life After Death," his second and final album that was released 16 days after his death, explaining: "I was a little worried for myself as an artist."
 "It's just really unfortunate what happened after that," continued Jay-Z. "The human side of him came through in his music and I think it moved the molecules in the world. I know for a fact it pointed me in the (right) direction and I'm sure that's happened to millions and millions of people worldwide."
 The Notorious B.I.G.'s son and daughter, C.J. and T'yanna Wallace, accepted the honor. The son of T. Rex's Marc Bolan, who died in 1977 at 29, was also on hand to pay tribute to his father with a touching speech.
 "As I reflect on this incredible honor of my dad and his band being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I think about how I really didn't have a chance to know him very well. He was taken away from all of us so early in his life," Rolan Bolan said. "I discovered his music pretty much the same way you have -- through my eyes and ears."
 The British band T. Rex was known primarily for its 1970s hit "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" and, to a lesser extent, "Jeepster." They were inducted by Ringo Starr.
 T. Rex, Houston, B.I.G. and the Doobie Brothers were inducted after being on the ballot for the first time. The Doobie Brothers' inclusion makes 2020 historic for the band -- it's also their 50th anniversary. The group known for hits like "Listen to the Music" and "Black Water" were supposed to celebrate this year with a tour featuring singer-songwriter Michael McDonald -- who sang with the band starting in 1975 before beginning his own solo career -- but it was postponed because of the pandemic.
 "It seems unreal, but it's been quite a trip and we aren't done yet," Tom Johnston said.
 It's also been a good year for Nine Inch Nails -- their induction comes two months after Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross won their first Emmy for their musical contributions to the hit HBO series "Watchmen." Reznor and Ross are also Oscar and Grammy winners, only needing a Tony to enter the esteemed EGOT club.
 Rick Rubin, Miley Cyrus, Jimmy Iovine, David Fincher, Mark Ronson and others spoke passionately about Nine Inch Nails' influence on them and others.
 "What a disoriented, strange year we find ourselves in. As I've been wrapping my head around Nine Inch Nails being welcomed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I think I was most looking forward to the ceremony itself, where hopefully the whole camp, past and present, was going to get together and have a moment, and we're all stuck in our little boxes here in our screens," Reznor said. "But even now music's always been the thing that keeps me going."
 Oscar winner Charlize Theron inducted Depeche Mode, whose biggest influence came in the 1980s when their post-punk, synthesizer-dominated music made the Brits a favorite of the goth subculture. Theron thanked the band "for being the soundtrack of my life."
 Dave Grohl, Bruce Springsteen, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jennifer Hudson, Adam Levine, Gwen Stefani and Brad Paisley also made appearances during the TV special. Top-notch music manager Irving Azoff and Jon Landau, who manages Springsteen, both earned the Ahmet Ertegun Award.
 The Rock Hall's annual induction ceremony was originally supposed to take place in May at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland, the city where the rock museum is located.

He captured the interaction on cell phone video and noted there was a black couple waiting in line ahead of him.
 “I was sitting there thinking, what do they think that someone saying that their lives matter is getting pulled out of line,” Arias said. “I kind of wonder if he would have had the courage to tell a Black person not to wear that shirt.”
 Arias said he knew he had a right to vote while wearing the shirt. He was soon addressed by what he called a second, more gracious manager, who checked the polling policies and allowed him in to vote.
 The Georgia native, who is White, won’t assume why the first poll worker prevented him from voting. But once the moment went viral, Arias also dealt with criticism from his neighbors.
 “I’m just standing up for my rights. Isn’t that what everybody is saying?” Arias said. “But then I stand up for my rights, and one lady on Nextdoor said she was going to contact the county elections office and have my vote undone. Because I wore a T-shirt she disagrees with.”
 Arias won’t call Forsyth County a racist place, but he believes bigotry exists. He said there’s also a history, noting the county’s infamous 1987 appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show for excluding Black people from the community.
 “I’ve grown up knowing that Forsyth County is a sundown county,” Arias said, meaning you didn’t want to be out after dark if you are a person of color.
 He also admits to his own racist behavior in the past.
 “I grew up here in the South, and you make ethnic jokes and use ethnic slurs, and get a laugh out of people,” Arias said. “I grew up with family that would say, ‘Well you know, them Black people’ this or that. And, ‘You can’t really trust what a Black person says.’”
 Arias said he, like many Whites, took issue with the rise in discussion over “White privilege.”
 “I had that very first White, knee-jerk reaction of, ‘I’m not privileged. I’ve worked hard for everything. No one’s giving me anything because I’m White,’” Arias said.

So when you talk about our long-term business model around subscription, Essential is going to play an important component of that. So from an Essential perspective, that's where we see it kind of playing, across different channels.

Thank you, Dan. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today to discuss our third-quarter 2020 financial results and recent business highlights. I would like to continue to provide an update regarding the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. Oyster Point Pharma continues to monitor the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic and is taking proactive steps to ensure the safety of its employees, maintain business continuity of our operations, and to advance our R&D pipeline.

As I go through the results, please bear in mind that year-over-year comparisons remain a function of the impact of the pandemic, franchise terminations over the last 12 months and the effect from having sold the vast majority of our owned hotels as we transition to an asset-light franchise model. In the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $3.1 million or $0.12 per share as compared to last year's net loss of $3.7 million or $0.15 per share.

The third thing on the content cost, no, we don't experience an increase or a pressure on content cost. We have long - and this is like 3 to 5 years deals with all the major content providers. And these are set deals at set prices. So any price increase we do go to not 100%, but to the majority, big majority of the increase remains with us. There is a couple of content costs, which are variable, and there's also a couple of other third-party costs like technology, et cetera, which slightly variable, but price increases, yes, tend to go straight into our pocket and deliver more than 80% gross margin.

Clients are dealing with increasing worker burnout, unanticipated attrition, and the needs of healthcare professionals to have time off, after months of stress and strain. Similarly, our clients' internal recruiting capabilities are being pushed to the max, and the labor demand pressure has challenged the ability of the healthcare staffing industry to respond. AMN then has been adding resources over the past few months, in response to these increased needs. This environment has further heightened interest for healthcare providers to have strong workforce partners, for which AMN has translated to the addition of many new clients, as well as the expansion and renewal of existing clients. This scarce labor environment also highlights the benefits of a staffing led managed services program, for which AMN is the nation's leading provider.

Kamala Harris sparked a buzz from Twitter tonight before she even uttered a word of her victory speech. The moment she stepped on stage in Delaware--to a Mary J. Blige song, no less--viewers were fixated on her vice presidential attire: a white pantsuit and silky, pussybow blouse. She also traded in her signature Converse sneakers for nude heels.
 The ivory look, reportedly from Carolina Herrera, is being viewed as an homage to women suffragists in the early 20th century, who wore all-white attire while fighting for the right to vote. In recent years, women in politics have made similar sartorial references, like Democratic Congresswomen in 2018, who wore white to the State of the Union address, or Hillary Clinton, who wore a white pantsuit when she became the first female presidential nominee for a major political party in 2016.
 Fashion historian and writer Shelby Ivey Christie also pointed out on Twitter that "monochromatic dressing is the mark of celebration in the Black community," noting another layer of significance in Senator Harris's ensemble.
 Viewers applauded the wardrobe choice.

Finally, the West Africa where the region as a whole continues to struggle, vessel revenues decreased 30% or $6.6 million compared to the previous quarter, the active vessel count was down by further 15 vessels from the previous quarter, which allowed us to increase active utilization from 55% during the second quarter of 2020 to 66% in the current quarter. Average day rates for the region were $9,643, an increase of 5% from where we were this time last year. Vessel operating loss for area was $10.2 million for the quarter compared to an operating profit for the same period last year of $678,000. The decrease is due mainly to the drop-off in revenue coupled with the cost to mobilize vessels at the layup positions. West Africa has been a struggle for everyone through 2020 as we come to terms with the pandemic. That's with the other regions in which we operate. We are starting to see some early green shoots as our clients start to look to open back up. Recovery will probably be a little slower than other areas, but we are fully committed and believe in the region going forward.

TAUNTON -- John-Paul and Peter Thomas had always wanted to own a restaurant in the Silver City.
 Since opening Bar 88 & Grille in 2017, the Taunton brothers looked to create a place with a little flare in the city.
 But when COVID-19 closed down their establishment at 88 Wales St. in March, the duo had to start again from scratch.
 "It was up and down before the pandemic," John-Paul said. "But like everybody else when COVID-19 hit, it took the wind out of our sails. But since coming back it has been very positive."
 Now, the best-kept secret in the city is back and better than ever.
 The restaurant specializes in thin crust, flatbread brick oven pizzas made fresh daily with straight mozzarella in a wood-fired, all natural brick oven outdoors with a temperature set at over 500 degrees.
 This unique, smoky-flavored pizza has many options on the menu, including classic cheese, Caprese, Greek, BBQ chicken, Hawaiian and Mediterranean. You can also build your toppings to satisfy your taste buds.
 They also serve fresh seafood, sandwiches, burgers, appetizers and other tasty entrees. There are 10 beers on tap and they will soon feature a margarita tap.
 John-Paul said he does offer fresh-made Lebanese food but had cut back on that option on their regular menu in July due to COVID-19.
 "We get a lot of people coming in for the first time and they did not know about this place," he said. "We're here. Everybody said 'We did not realize you were here … I did not know it existed'."
 Bar 88 & Grille, which used to be called Anthony's 88, the Red Whippet, Cape Verdean Club and Esprito-Santo, reopened in July and has gone all out to keep diners safe amid COVID.
 Twelve tables on the inside are 6 feet or more apart. The bar area has partitions in place that seats two patrons only. John-Paul and his brother also built and designed one of the nicest outdoor patios in Taunton, with 14 tables set at six-feet apart or more.
 The newly renovated building, which has seven staff members, also has a lot of custom work on the interior. There are two sets of bathrooms inside and 10 televisions, including two outdoors.
 In the middle of the dining area, there is a sliding divider that allows for the creation of a function room.
 John-Paul said they host political functions, weddings, bereavement functions, birthdays, engagements and graduation commencement events
 The main sign on the front of the building was originally on the old Benjamin's on Bay Street. John-Paul had it restored and replaced it with his restaurant's name.
 He re-skinned the walls, the ceilings, redid the bar and changed the floors, which used to be vinyl and rugs. All the floors are now brand new.
 "Now I just need people to sit in the seats and enjoy the place," John-Paul said.
 Maureen Higgins, a neighbor, has been a steady customer to Bar 88 & Grille since it opened. She often helps out when needed and said the restaurant is loved by everyone who comes in.
 "I've seen it grow so much," she said "Now they just need that boost. As a neighbor, you want to support it in the worst of COVID-19. I used to be a restaurant business. I try and see the needs of the business since I was into it. [I] just try to be eyes and ears."
 Bar 88 is currently working to promote and build a website for the restaurant as well as making sure online platforms Grubhub and Doordash are tied to the eatery.
 John-Paul said he appreciates loyal customers like Higgins.
 "We have a lot of great people like Maureen and her husband that ordered food weekly along with a handful of customers," he said. "But it wasn't enough to sustain anything. Maureen has been an awesome neighbor and a good customer."
 Another feature of the restaurant is that there are one or two pieces of acoustic entertainment on Saturdays from 5 p.m.-8 p.m.
 John-Paul said he would like to expand their demographics inside.
 Although it is an adjustment sitting inside, Bar 88 has a beautiful layout to keep their customer's safe.
 John-Paul advised, "I take every precaution necessary. I don't skip out on the guidelines. I like what we have. It's comfortable and cozy. Bar 88 & Grille is where family and friends gather."
 Bar 88 & Grille will also be adding a new fall menu and will soon offer takeout and delivery.
 Due to the new COVID-19 restrictions in place, the restaurant will open Tuesday through Sunday from 3 p.m to 9 p.m. They are closed on Mondays.

Well, so for the time being, so level of shareholding after the merger is not really relevant, because I think that - because of the way the deal is a merger, so the differences in valuation so will drive a very, very short range in the shareholding after the merge. I think that now the relevant part of the process is that - so the final valuation are expected in days. And the very point is that all the deal is based on the fact that this 65% of shareholding limitation will be removed by the EGM.

I think you have covered the key points. I mean, at the end of the day, I think, we have learned quite well how to work in this virtual environment and I think that will -- we will continue to do that to some degree as we move forward and that will drive savings in the areas that you talked about from a travel perspective, as well as from a facility perspective. So those are two key areas.

Thanks, Harry. The RFP was - we received a robust response to our proposed - our RFP back in September, and it's a little too early to announce, exactly where that's going to head as we continue to conduct due diligence on some of the responses we received and negotiate agreements, but we do expect that it will result in some contracts that we execute for renewable natural gas. And in parallel with that we continue to evaluate investment opportunities through SB98 to invest directly in renewable natural gas projects. So we expect over time, we'll end up with a portfolio of some renewable gas purchase agreements and then some direct investments that we make into renewable natural gas. And I think your question around whether or not the hydrogen project was separate or related to our RNG, RFP, it is. They are two separate projects. They are related only in that, they both will have a meaningful impact on our carbon savings goal, but they are two separate projects and workstreams within the company.

Yes. So we've made a lot of really nice progress so far on securing arrangements with some of the OEMs that we build blades for as well as some third parties. We're not going to give specific dollars on it right now. We may give some - a little bit more specificity when we give 2021 guidance. But suffice it to say that we look at this business as fairly high-growth opportunity, higher-margin business than our traditional blade business. So we expect it to become a fairly significant part of the overall picture over time. We'll try to give you a little bit more specificity when we talk in 2021, but, at this point, just suffice it to say that we're really pleased with the progress we've made and what we've got from a backlog standpoint and pipeline moving into 2021.

Thanks, Peter, and good morning everyone. As you update your models with our Q3 results, there are two factors I want to draw your attention to. First, in light of the recent unprecedented and steep runup in North American Benchmark OSB prices, I'll remind you of the inherent lag in our realized prices versus these benchmarks during periods of rapidly changing prices. This lag which cuts both ways of course occurs because of the timing impact of our order files for commodity and value-added products as well as the roughly 25% of our North American volume that goes into specialty end-users where negotiated prices don't move up or down with the commodity benchmarks. And second, while we are optimistic about current market indicators, we also recognize that we are now entering the winter construction period when demand typically slows down.

It's really a bit of everything. Certainly there are permanent nurses that have decided to convert into a travel position. Some of them are even, what we would call lapsed travelers, people who used to work with us. Maybe a few years ago, they went into a permanent role, and now we're recruiting back into the industry. Those numbers are up for us as well. Some are with competitors, but quite honestly, everyone is having difficulty recruiting. More so, we're recruiting from nurses who maybe were in a permanent position. Perhaps they were laid off, or were doing something else and then we're bringing them back into the workforce, but in a traveler or flexible assignment. Some might be in a permanent role today, and they are burned out and overloaded in their current environment, and they want a break. But they do want to and need to continue to work in, and love what they do as a nurse.

So I think at the end of the day, I do expect something like a mix, how we will use the €300 million. But definitely, we stand to what we told everybody before that when we will create or generate a gain out of the investment of Sunrise, we will let the shareholders participate in it.

In Q3, Android Central named our Floodlight among the Best Outdoor Security Cameras of 2020. And Techaeris called it the best wireless floodlight camera they've used yet. In summary, Arlo's Q3 results provide a window for where the business is heading, as we continue our transition to the new business model. The team continued to execute at a high level, as we answer to the challenges from the pandemic and drove innovation while still managing costs. This performance has provided a compelling set of data points that speak volumes about the long-term prospects and trajectory of the business.

Yes. So, yes indeed. So, we always communicate indeed that we would estimate around EUR 400 million. As you can imagine, likewise, with the work we're doing in the workstreams, et cetera. And we're now looking into next year at this point in time, we are already putting that together.

Well, I think there is sort of two things Heather and I would point to, first of all, we have enjoyed this incredibly strong pricing environment because demands really since May or maybe even earlier has been recovering significantly faster than we had anticipated, be it even bringing additional capacity on board in August, it didn't impact that significantly, the reality of OSB demand is that this impacted by seasonal factors, so we would fully expect demand to retreat in the winter months, and so we are at the beginning of that season and so certainly when I look at what we are experiencing, we are now back on time but our shipments no longer well behind like we were, unfortunately, earlier in the season.

Sosa'nın yokluğunda gerçek pozisyonuna dönen Pelkas'ın bence artık alternatif değil asıl oyuncu olması gerekiyor. Savunma anlamında zayıf kalsa da çabukluğu ve hızlı düşünmesiyle bu açığını hücumda kapatıyor. Thiam 1-2 maç ağzımıza bal çaldı. Sonrası ise kocaman bir hayalkırıklığı... Erol hocayı geçen haftalarda uyardım. Sadece kör ortalarla sonuca gidemezsin diye. Daha organize, daha çeşitli ve tabi ki merkezden hücumun planlarını yapması gerekiyor. Rakibin tandem uzunlarının hava hakimiyeti iyiyse yandan yapılan ortaların tehlikesi kalmıyor. Hakem kafasına göre iptal ettiği Fenerbahçe golüyle puan kaybının 1 numaralı sorumlusuydu. Ama kimse kusura bakmasın 2 numaraya da Fenerbahçe teknik heyetini koyarım. Şimdi uzun bir ara ve her takımdan daha fazla süresi var Fenerbahçe'nin... Bu ara uyum dönemi için son şans. Umarım iyi değerlendirilir.

Turning to our dividend, you will have seen that our Board increased the dividend to $0.60 Canadian per share this quarter on the back of record financial results and continued optimism about end-market demand. This is entirely consistent with our variable dividend policy that gives us the flexibility to adjust the payout level up and down as our operating results outlook and balance sheet permit as well as being consistent with our historically balanced approach to capital allocation. It also recognizes the need for resilience and balance sheet flexibility given the significant uncertainty hanging over our positive outlook, which Peter will outline in a moment. In recognition of our strong Q3 financial results and our positive outlook, we have returned our 2020 capital expenditures back to the original target of $100 million. And looking ahead to next year, we have a preliminary 2021 CapEx budget of $150 million. We will focus this higher budget on reducing manufacturing costs, enhancing process safety across our mills, further investments to support the company's industrial sales growth strategy hence continuation of the Chambord ribald and with that, I'll pass the call back to Peter.

Turning to Slide 7. I'll now give you a quick update of our global operations as well as a market update before turning it over to Bryan for a financial update. During the third quarter, we operated at or above capacity in all of our facilities for most of the quarter. As you may recall, our plants in Mexico were still ramping to full capacity at the end of the second quarter and, since the end of, July have been operating near or above our normal capacity. In China, we still expect to deliver more volume than our original 2020 plan as production continues uninterrupted. In India, we are moving full speed ahead with the ramp of the facility, and we are preparing to start-up two lines for Nordex in early 2021. In Turkey, production is at a full pace with, the exception of the transition of lines for Vestas to their state-of- the-art V162 blade as part of the extension of that contract.
