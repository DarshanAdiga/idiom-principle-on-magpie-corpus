And so to answer the second part of your question, sorry, chess came into my life when I went to Brooklyn Technical High School. Now I knew the rules of chess actually, I knew the rules of chess from Jamaica because we played a lot of games in Jamaica. We didn't have television. The TV came on at six o'clock at night and the first thing that came on was the news and it was two channels. So you didn't want to watch that as a kid, so you learned to play games. And I had a very passionate love of games, and it was a lot of board games, whether it was checkers, which we called draughts, whether it was card games, and chess was one of those games that my brother and his friends got hooked into and I kind of played around with it for a bit.

Detroit Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera recorded his 40th career multi-homer game on Thursday night against the Kansas City Royals, and his first since September 30, 2016. He now has 480 homers for his career, putting him in position to top the 500 mark sometime in 2021.
 Cabrera's first home run of the night came on a hanging slider from right- hander Brady Singer, who was making his second career start.

The family affair proved strong for John Esterbrook Jr. and John Esterbrook III, putting them at 4-under 66. Esterbrook Jr.’s three birdies on the front nine put the duo in business. Two more birdies from the elder Esterbrook helped seal a strong score. Esterbrook III had some critical pars on holes Esterbrook Jr. bogeyed to help the cause.
 Gregg Spiro’s five-birdie day was a catalyst in Spiro and partner Kevin Thompson shooting 4-under.
 Rutland Country Club’s Frankie Sanborn and St. Johnsbury’s Devin Knight had a strong qualifying round. The duo put up a 3-under score.
 Sanborn and Knight both birdied holes on the front nine and headed into the second half of their round at 1-under. Knight’s two birdies on the back nine paced the pair. The final of those birdies came on the 18th hole.
 The Country Club of Barre duo of Eric Lajeunesse and Bryson Richards were tied with Sanborn and Knight in the qualifying round.
 Richards birdied twice on the front nine, while Lajeunesse birdied once. A bogey on the second hole was the lone blemish through those holes. A bogey from both guys on the par-5 13th hole hurt them, but they bounced back when Lajeunesse birdied the next hole.
 Seven-time Pierce champions Jody Larson and Mike Dukette were one of three teams to shoot 2-under for the day. Larson’s three-birdie back nine was the catalyst to a strong showing Thursday. A few late bogeys mixed in hurt the duo, but it was more than enough to secure a spot in the championship flight.
 Neshobe Golf Club’s Walker Allen and Freeman Allen and 2019 quarterfinalists Jared Barber and Jeffrey Houle also shot 2-under.
 Rutland Country Club’s Garren Poirier and his partner Evan Russell were solid throughout the qualifying round. Russell birdied a pair of holes on the front nine and Poirier did the same on the back half. A few late bogeys kept the duo from being near the top of the leaderboard at 1-under.
 Poirier’s partner from last year’s Pierce, Bryan Smith, teamed with clubmate Mark Hungerford. They shot 1-under. RCC’s Max Major and teammate Mike Morin were also at 1-under.
 Brian Hill and Dale Patterson shot 1-under. Hill had three birdies, including two to start the back nine. The teams of Michael Morgan and Jack Morgan and Joel Hartwell and Harrison Hartwell also were 1-under.
 Matt Wilkinson and Taylor Bellemare rounded out the 1-under finishers.

Luann and Kerry Seifen, of Canonsburg, started giving out bags of food and clothing to people in need a couple years ago, after Luann had witnessed a woman on the side of a roadway holding up a sign that asked for help.
 “She had a sign that said she was homeless, and after seeing that I thought I’d talk to my husband about what we can do to help people,” Luann said in a recent interview. “It was around Christmastime, and we ended up putting together 25 bags of food and clothing for people.”
 Since then, they’ve given out 75 similar bags, which they distribute in the Canonsburg and Pittsburgh areas.
 “We find people walking on the streets who seem like they’re in need,” Luann said. “I’ll try to pray with them, and we’ll go on our way.”

Hikers in Las Trampas Regional Wilderness are welcome to enjoy the outskirts of the Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site, but otherwise the Tao House is available only online as visits are canceled due to Contra Costa County's shelter-in-place order.
 To provide fans with a touch of the playwright and his peaceful home in the Danville hills, where he lived from 1937-44, the Eugene O'Neill Foundation, Tao House has been filming videos dubbed "Virtual Gene" and posting them at www.eugeneoneill.org.
 In one short video, artistic director Eric Fraisher Hayes talks about the series. He is in the Old Barn theater, standing before remains of a set of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Long Day's Journey into Night," written at Tao House.
 "Using various social media platforms we intend to highlight the beauty and the history of Tao House, the power and the poetry of Eugene O'Neill's words as well as the often overlooked ironic wit of America's first great playwright," Hayes says.
 "In the coming months look for virtual contributions from artists, scholars, the national park service as well as general enthusiasts."
 In another video, he announces upcoming online productions of O'Neill plays.
 "With live performances canceled for the foreseeable future, we've been forced to think of new ways to bring you the plays of Eugene O'Neill," Hayes says. "Earlier this year we were scheduled to present some of his one-act plays, also known as 'The Lost Plays.' As we go virtual, we've decided to stick with 'The Lost Plays' as it seems appropriate to do 'lost plays' in this 'lost year' of theater."
 The one-act plays include "The Web," "Abortion" and "Recklessness." Hayes will work with actors in the Old Barn, which will become an open air studio, he explains. After editing, the performances will be presented virtually in a series of rolling premieres starting in late September or early October.
 Some performances may be filmed in the Tao House courtyard if the sound system permits, Hayes adds.
 "As Tao House has been closed to the public for months, and visitors have been deprived or dispossessed of the opportunity to enjoy its beauty and feel its power, we wanted to share a little bit of it with you," he says.
 Another video features Dan McGovern, president of the Eugene O'Neill Foundation Board of Directors, standing in O'Neill's study inside the Tao House.
 "We want to stay in touch with you and that's why we're making these 'Virtual Gene' videos," McGovern says. "And we want to continue to bring great theater to you."
 Other short films are "A Short Hiking Tour of Tao House" by board member John Barry, and "10 Essential Tips on Visiting Tao House" by Teresa and Dan Morley.
 "Like everyone we are facing new challenges, but I like to think of it as an opportunity," Hayes says.

Except the bar, at least, you can study for, and there's content on there that you have to learn. In chess, you have to deal with the fact that whatever you know, there's somebody sitting across the board, trying to destroy you and prove you wrong. And that's a very different kind of ladder to have to climb. So no Grandmaster wants to be the one that somebody else stepped over to become a Grandmaster themselves. And so it's cutthroat, it's trial by fire. It's amazing. It's like the top black belts in karate, right? You've got your Bruce Lees.

 “I remember explaining this to him and he wasn’t happy as he was scoring a few goals at that stage in his career but I told him he wasn’t speedy enough in those positions to make it in Europe.
 “For me, he was more suited to the mould of a No.6.

Hurt. Angry. Unsafe.
   
 That's how Jasmine Yuan says she felt in March when a stranger in a car yelled "corona!" at her while driving by in a grocery store parking lot in North Austin.
   
 Yuan, 39, said she loves Austin and considers it a diverse, multicultural city, but lamented that she now fears areas of town that used to be part of her everyday life. After the incident, Yuan said she has avoided public places that she feels might put her at risk of being targeted again.
   
 "I feel scared and intimidated. I just don't want to have this experience happen again," Yuan said.
   
 Racist verbal and physical attacks have been reported at growing rates around the country since March, according to people who have started tracking the trend nationally.
   
 And local Asian American community leaders like Hugh Li, president of the education and philanthropy group Austin Chinese American Network, fear anti- Asian attitudes tied to the coronavirus pandemic could stick around long after the pandemic and worsen due to waning U.S.-China relations and economic hardship.
   
 "I think this will naturally put Asian Americans, and particularly Chinese Americans, in a really bad bind," he said.
   
 Li said his organization recently circulated a survey asking its hundreds of members to report incidents of racism they have witnessed or experienced during the pandemic, and it has so far have received two reports.
   
 Yuan, who moved to the U.S. 13 years ago and has lived in Austin with her husband and two children since 2011, responded to the survey. She said she did not immediately report her experience at the grocery store, hoping it had been an isolated incident.
   
 "But if more and more of this happens, this becomes a trend," Yuan said. "That makes me think that I need to stand up and talk about this."
   
 Austin resident Jae Kwon, 35, who is Korean American, said he was the target of several aggressions that he suspects were motivated by race.
   
 Kwon, a University of Texas sociology doctoral student who has lived in Austin since 2015, said something was thrown at him, a woman screamed something inaudible from a car, and a stranger yelled obscenities at him during a six- day span in May while he was running for exercise. On another occasion, Kwon said a person sprayed him with a water gun while driving by.
   
 "It's unusual in the sense that things like this had not happened other times," said Kwon, who also served 12 years in the U.S. Navy. "I can only think that these are unrelated incidents, but it's related in the sense that it happened in this time period."
   
 G. Michael Pendon, 43, a local DJ, reported that a group of men harassed him using anti-Chinese and homophobic slurs while he was riding a bicycle through a neighborhood near the UT campus July 18.
   
 Pendon, whose parents came to the U.S. from the Philippines in the 1960s, said he could not sleep that night.
   
 "I was pissed off. I was tired. I felt like I needed to go down there. I was kind of obsessed about trying to figure this out," he said.
   
 Austin police have confirmed that they are investigating the matter. Pendon said he has also spoken to the UT Police Department.
   
 "I just want to identify these perpetrators," Pendon said.
   
 Resurfacing biases
   
 Experts in the field of Asian American history say racial violence and tensions during events like a pandemic are not a new phenomenon.
   
 Russell Jeung, chair of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, said the pandemic has reignited old, yet lingering anti-Asian sentiments in the West.
   
 "There is a historical stereotype on Asians -- the yellow peril -- that they are a threat that would come dominate the West with their hordes and their diseases," Jeung said.
   
 Jeung helped start Stop AAPI Hate, an online system in which people across the country can report racially charged incidents against Asian Americans through a form that has been translated into more than 10 languages.
   
 "We launched it, and immediately we got flooded with responses, and using the data we've been sharing it with local jurisdictions," Jeung said.
   
 Jeung said that, from March 19 through July 1, the organization received more than 2,120 reports of racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans from across the country.
   
 In more than 500 cases, Jeung said people reported being told to go back to China. One respondent from Austin said they were told to go back to their country by a person who used a racial epithet to describe the coronavirus.
   
 A relatively small number of cases -- 63 incidents -- were from Texas, but reports came from every major Texas city. About 22% of those reports involved physical attacks, more than double the national rate, Jeung said. About 63% of reported attacks in Texas were verbal.
   
 People of Chinese descent are not the only segment of the Asian American population targeted since the pandemic started. On March 14, three people of Burmese descent, two of whom were 2- and 6-year-old children, were attacked in the West Texas city of Midland by a man with a knife.
   
 Jeung said Trump's rhetoric on China makes Asian Americans more vulnerable to racist attacks.
   
 According to Factba.se, an independent online database of words from Trump's speeches, media interviews and tweets, the president used the term "China Virus" or "Chinese Virus" a total of eight times between March and April, not including instances in which he blamed China for the pandemic without using those terms.
   
 In July alone, the database showed that Trump used different variations of the phrase at least 32 times.
   
 "Trump makes the connection that the virus is Chinese, but he also normalizes the hate," Jeung said.
   
 Jeung said the news media's framing of discussions and depictions of the pandemic, especially in its early days, also has eroded the image of the Asian community in the country.
   
 In addition to referring to the pathogen as the "Wuhan Virus," many news organizations frequently ran clips and images of people of East Asian descent wearing face masks, Jeung said.
   
 "We all have implicit biases, and we have fight or flight responses," Jeung said. "During the pandemic people are fearful, and when they're fearful, they automatically respond."
   
 A local group called the Austin Asian Community Health Initiative in May started a reporting system for pandemic-related racist aggressions, and is working with Austin Public Health to track the data. Though the organization has not yet received any local reports, Executive Director Hailey Easley said she believes the tool will be useful in tracking racism well after the pandemic.
   
 "I actually see this opening up," Easley said. "I imagine that this could be helpful beyond COVID-19, and it could be helpful for people of all ethnicities and all races."
   
 Local response
   
 Amy Wong Mok, an established activist in the local Asian community, has been informing Mayor Steve Adler and Austin Police Chief Brian Manley about racist incidents that she has heard about.
   
 In March, Mok, along with representatives from the Asian American Quality of Life Advisory Commission, alerted city officials about rising anti-Asian racism amid the pandemic.
   
 Mok said she heard multiple accounts of people being verbally harassed in March, and more recently, reported that an Asian food supply company had three of its trucks vandalized.
   
 Mok said she will continue to push city leaders to raise awareness and investigate reported incidents.
   
 "No matter how long we've been here, no matter how much we contribute to society, we're still viewed as outsiders," Mok said.
   
 The Austin City Council in April unanimously passed a resolution condemning racism and hate speech against Asian Americans.
   
 Adler told the American-Statesman that city officials will continue working to address anti-Asian racism in the city.
   
 "Austin is no place for hate. We will continue to do all we can -- in every way we can -- to help make sure that all our neighbors feel safe," Adler said in a written statement. "We can't prevent all this behavior but we can shine light on it, condemn and make clear it is not tolerated in Austin."
   
 Alice Yi, president of the Austin chapter of the Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs, said political participation can fight the stereotype that Asian Americans are perpetual foreigners.
   
 Yi said her organization is working to get more people registered to vote in the November elections and has also helped people in the Asian American community fill out the 2020 census.
   
 "If we have a huge amount of representation, maybe we cannot be scapegoated so easily," Yi said. "If we have a larger headcount, we might have more representation politically and have more power to speak out and speak louder."

And I went, fortunately, there was one in my neighborhood. I went to the dojo, and it was really life-changing. It took my game to a totally different level. I just learned to recognize, primarily aikido is defensive, so aikido recognizes the flaws in attacks. And I would say, I'm from Brooklyn, we had a school of chess that said, "You attack. That's how you go." My friend Ronnie Simpson used to say, "Ever forward, never backward." So, he's not backing up, when he's coming after you, you're supposed to die. But you did that against the best players, and somehow they would sidestep your attacks, and bring their pieces inside the gaps that you left behind. And that's exactly what aikido, and many of the soft martial arts are about, is finding the gaps, and letting you get as much of your attack as you want off. But just getting off- center enough that you miss, or you barely hit. But then the return coming at you, is going to come with tremendous force.

"This was another highly unusual quarter, and I couldn't be more proud of and grateful to our employees around the globe," said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement Thursday.
 Amazon said its investment in coronavirus measures during the quarter included funds for purchasing protective equipment for employees and enhancing warehouse cleaning as well as adding family care benefits and paying out bonuses to front-line warehouse and delivery workers.
 In April, Bezos told shareholders to "take a seat" when he announced the company's plan to reinvest billions in coronavirus-related expenses. Analysts said the investments may have been an effort to avoid employee unionization efforts, which would likely cost the company more in the long run. The company previously came under fire after warehouse workers said the company wasn't doing enough to protect their health.

At least one officer named in the Open Vallejo report denied taking part in such a practice. "My badge has never been bent," he told the paper. "That's a lie."
 In a statement released Wednesday, Vallejo Police Chief Shawny Williams said the new information had prompted the inquiry and that it would help him "to understand the culture of the department in a greater way and to take corrective action."
 "If there is credible evidence found, I will expand the inquiry into an official investigation," Williams said in the statement.
 Shortly after Open Vallejo published its story, Lt. Michael Nichelini, the Vallejo police union president, called the story "beyond inflammatory" statement obtained by the Mercury News. He said that he was not aware of the alleged badge-bending practice. "Frankly, it's a ridiculous notion," he said.
 Whitney, a 19-year veteran of the department, learned of the secret ritual in February 2019 following the shooting of a local rapper in the drive-thru of a fast food restaurant, according to his lawyer, Alison Berry Wilkinson.
 "To take pride in that (shootings) is absolutely condemnable in my view," Wilkinson told CNN. "It's highly unethical and it doesn't fit the code of ethics for policing. And certainly, it was something he felt he needed to be ended."
 Citing confidentiality, Wilkinson said she couldn't release more details. But she said Whitney raised his concern with then-Police Chief Andrew Bidou, who instructed him to address the issue at a command staff meeting.
 "During that meeting, Captain Whitney wanted all supervisors to inspect their subordinates' uniforms and collect badges," Wilkinson said.
 She confirmed other details of the Open Vallejo story, including that 10 suspicious badges were eventually put in a cardboard box and brought to the chief's office.
 "When the chief saw how many there were that needed to be repaired, he was concerned it would raise suspicion with the city finance department, and so he then ordered the badges be returned to the officers with an instruction that the officers fix them," Wilkinson said her client told her.

Adelaide United kept up their top-six push with an enthralling 5-3 defeat of Perth Glory in Thursday's A-League clash.
 Kristian Opseth scored one and set up two more as Carl Veart's side made it three games without defeat to move level on points with fifth-place Perth.
 Riley McGree missed a 15th-minute penalty but the home side scored twice in two minutes through Michael Jakobsen and Lachlan Brook before the half-hour mark.
 Kristian Popovic pulled a goal back but Opseth headed in Adelaide's third and teed up Ben Halloran to fire home the fourth before half-time.
 Pacifique Niyongabire scored a fine first A-League goal, twisting and turning in the box before rifling in a shot, his stylish somersault celebration a fitting tribute to a thrilling game.
 Bruno Fornaroli's fine turn and finish made it 5-2 and Juande scored from the spot in the 83rd minute, but Glory will be feeling the heat in the top-six chase after back-to-back losses.

And now games could last between three and a half to six hours. There's no set time because you keep getting time added depending on the number of moves you play and it varies. But like I said, between three and a half to six hours, that gives you ample time to study, to be accurate, to analyze all the moves, to play strategic niceties, nuances, but that's not what we grew up with in Brooklyn. It was all body blows. It just hit him, hit him again, hit him again. I mean, guys had tactics. When I say tactics, I mean moves that were like pyrotechnics, you think, "Where did that come from?" You thought you had the position under control and somebody would drop a move and it would just explode on the board. It's like, "What? That's playable?" So you just had to be absolutely fierce and focused and maintain that discipline all the way through because these guys were true ninjas on the board.

Now, this country is a constant work in progress. We were born with instructions: to form a more perfect union. Explicit in those words is the idea that we are imperfect; that what gives each new generation purpose is to take up the unfinished work of the last and carry it further than anyone might have thought possible.


  John Lewis – the first of the Freedom Riders, head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, youngest speaker at the March on Washington, leader of the march from Selma to Montgomery, Member of Congress representing the people of this state and this district for 33 years, mentor to young people, including me at the time, until his final day on this Earth – he not only embraced that responsibility, but he made it his life’s work.


  Which isn’t bad for a boy from Troy. John was born into modest means – that means he was poor – in the heart of the Jim Crow South to parents who picked somebody else’s cotton. Apparently, he didn’t take to farm work – on days when he was supposed to help his brothers and sisters with their labor, he’d hide under the porch and make a break for the school bus when it showed up. His mother, Willie Mae Lewis, nurtured that curiosity in this shy, serious child. “Once you learn something,” she told her son, “once you get something inside your head, no one can take it away from you.”


  As a boy, John listened through the door after bedtime as his father’s friends complained about the Klan. One Sunday as a teenager, he heard Dr. King preach on the radio. As a college student in Tennessee, he signed up for Jim Lawson’s workshops on the tactic of nonviolent civil disobedience. John Lewis was getting something inside his head, an idea he couldn’t shake that took hold of him – that nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience were the means to change laws, but also change hearts, and change minds, and change nations, and change the world.


  So he helped organize the Nashville campaign in 1960. He and other young men and women sat at a segregated lunch counter, well-dressed, straight-backed, refusing to let a milkshake poured on their heads, or a cigarette extinguished on their backs, or a foot aimed at their ribs, refused to let that dent their dignity and their sense of purpose. And after a few months, the Nashville campaign achieved the first successful desegregation of public facilities in any major city in the South.


  John got a taste of jail for the first, second, third … well, several times. But he also got a taste of victory. And it consumed him with righteous purpose. And he took the battle deeper into the South.


  That same year, just weeks after the Supreme Court ruled that segregation of interstate bus facilities was unconstitutional, John and Bernard Lafayette bought two tickets, climbed aboard a Greyhound, sat up front, and refused to move. This was months before the first official Freedom Rides. He was doing a test. The trip was unsanctioned. Few knew what they were up to. And at every stop, through the night, apparently the angry driver stormed out of the bus and into the bus station. And John and Bernard had no idea what he might come back with or who he might come back with. Nobody was there to protect them. There were no camera crews to record events. You know, sometimes, we read about this and kind of take it for granted. Or at least we act as if it was inevitable. Imagine the courage of two people Malia’s age, younger than my oldest daughter, on their own, to challenge an entire infrastructure of oppression.


  John was only twenty years old. But he pushed all twenty of those years to the center of the table, betting everything, all of it, that his example could challenge centuries of convention, and generations of brutal violence, and countless daily indignities suffered by African Americans.

Of course, you can't be specific. Everybody's going to have their own experiences, but by and large, you're going to go out of school or you're going to go get work. You're going to try to establish yourself. Somewhere along the line, you're going to get a significant other. Eventually, you're going to have children. You're going to go through that father period. Someplace, you're going to have a little age crisis somewhere along the way that your identity is going to shift a few times as you challenge yourself. And then at some point you're going to become settled in who you are. You come to have a different level of acceptance and settle who you are and start to accept the world for what it is and your place in it.

And I wanted to be like the people in the books, I wanted to play at that level. And the only way you could do that was if I left the group or I didn't stay just inside the group and played in the clubs in New York. And I was very fortunate because New York is a hotbed for chess activity and some of the strongest players in the country were living in New York. So I started going to the Manhattan Chess Club, the Marshall Chess Club, and those were the two venerable clubs and playing against the Grandmasters there. And that took my game to another level and it eventually allowed me, in fact, to come back to the Black Bear School and become the president, as we called it.

Trey Olson led the Grizzlies with a pair of hits and three runs batted in during the contest while Cruz Taylor was the pitching hero, keeping the Grizzlies in the game for his six innings on the mound.


  In the second game on Wednesday, the Blackfoot Broncos found themselves playing the South Fremont Cougars for the second time in eight days, having fallen to the Cougars a week ago on Monday by the score of 6-4.


  Tuesday was beginning to look a lot like that game, as the Broncos gave up single runs in the first four innings, two of them without the benefit of a hit. By the time the Broncos got to the bottom of the fourth, they were trailing by a 4-1 score and things were beginning to look a bit bleak.


  That is when the Broncos dug in and made the most of the situation by scoring two runs on only two hits and crept closer. You could feel the momentum changing as it shifted from being squarely on the shoulders of the Cougars to the Broncos’ dugout.


  When starting pitcher Candon Dahle walked the first batter he faced in the fifth inning, a reliever was summoned by coach Zach Reay and in came Nate Goodwin, the team’s starting third baseman.


  All Goodwin was able to do was work through three innings of play without giving up a run. He may have only had a single strikeout, but he made a couple of good fielding plays from the mound and enticed the Cougars’ hitters to hit the ball right at one of his own fielders and the teams went to the bottom of the sixth with the score still 4-3 in favor of South Fremont.


  Leadoff hitter Stryker Wood beat out an infield single and when Kyler Mills was able to turn a sacrifice bunt into a hit, the Broncos had things going their way. By the time they were done, they had scored three times to take the lead at 6-4 and with Goodwin on the mound, it was as good as done.


  Goodwin retired the side in order in the top of the seventh and the Broncos were still alive, moving to a Wednesday afternoon matchup where they played another elimination game.

But not only that, I'm able to very easily check which are his favorite lines. Well, that guy plays everything, but where is his inclination? When does he lose? What kind of things happens to cause him to lose games? What kind of situation am I trying to avoid? So that's when you have to really dig deep into the psychology of the player, through the information you're getting from their games. That was a huge part of our preparation, and you can't do that half-heartedly. You've got to be ready. That's digging, that's note-taking, that's research, at the highest level, and you've got to study your openings.
