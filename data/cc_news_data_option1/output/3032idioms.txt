ELY — The Eveleth-Gilbert Senior Babe Ruth baseball team had a flare for the dramatic Saturday in their playoff opener with International Falls.


  Down 3-2 heading into the top of the seventh inning, the Golden Bears needed to score quickly to stay alive in the 8th District playoffs winners bracket.


  With two runners on base, a single from Brandon Lind that landed just inside the right field line brought home Zach Lindseth to tie the game. Previously reaching after being hit by a pitch, the hit also moved Tommy Schlotec to third base and Eveleth-Gilbert’s third baseman knew it was now or never if he wanted to score with two outs.


  Carter Flannigan at the plate, International Falls pitcher Jett Tomczak released the pitch and Schlotec took off from third. Schlotec had just enough speed as his dive home beat out the tag, scoring the go-ahead run to put his squad up 4-3.


  Eveleth-Gilbert pitcher Brandon Lind closed out his phenomenal complete game in the bottom of the seventh, recording three outs in three at-bats to seal the win for the Bears, setting up a date with top-seeded Ely in the next game.


  Eveleth-Gilbert head coach Jamie Lindseth expected a close game, especially if both teams were playing at their best.


  “It was a good game,” Lindseth said. “We knew it would be close. If everybody is taking care of the baseball and throwing strikes and everybody is trying to put the ball in play, it’s going to be a close game. We had a couple mistakes and any team is going to try and take advantage of those mistakes.”


  On the seventh inning comeback, Lindseth says his squad showed tremendous amounts of leadership to take back the lead for the final time.


  “It starts with your leaders. Zach [Lindseth] came up struggling. He’s been frustrated and then he gets us a base hit to get the inning going. And then it takes a guy like Tommy to make what he did happen. They all did what they had to do. He went and stole home on his own. I can’t take any credit for that.”


  International Falls got the scoring started in the bottom of the second inning after Riley Larson led things off with a single to left field. Next up, Simon Palm drove him home with a double to deep center field.


  A blooper to right field from Owen Wherley moved Palm to third and he was brought home thanks to a sacrifice fly from Blaine Humbert.


  The Golden Bears managed to respond with a run in the top of the fourth after Schlotec reached on an infield single that got caught between the pitcher and the shortstop. Designated hitter Kodi Intihar at the plate, Schlotec made his way to second on a wild pitch and then stole third later in the at-bat to put him 90 feet from home.


  Intihar came up big in the at-bat himself, ripping a single down the left field line to score Schlotec, putting Eveleth-Gilbert on the scoreboard for the first time.


  E-G tied things up an inning later and started things off with a leadoff walk for Andrew Hakly. Lindseth now up at the plate, another wild pitch from International Falls pitcher Joe Talmage allowed Hakly to advance all the way to third. Lindseth flew out for the second out, leaving Hakly at third base.


  He’d score shortly after that, however. Schlotec at the plate, yet another wild pitch from Talmage gave Hakly the time he needed to sprint home for the score, knotting the game up at 2. Schlotec then reached on a walk but Talmage got the third out quickly after to end the inning.


  International Falls had their share of late game success as well, bringing the go-ahead run home in the bottom of the sixth inning.


  With one out, Larson and Palm reached in a single and an outfield error, respectively. Palm, now at third, made his way home after Wherley dropped a single into shallow center field, putting his squad up 3-2 with one inning to go.


  The Bears’ seventh inning response, however, put the opening playoff tilt in their favor thanks, in part, to the pitching of Brandon Lind on the mound.


  “Brandon threw well and it was nice to get a whole game out of him,” coach Lindseth said after the game. “These few days are going to be all about arms. How many do we have and how many can keep throwing. We have probably eight or nine kids that can throw the ball fairly well so it’s nice to have him go out and keep all of our options open for the next few games.”


  Eveleth-Gilbert had an immediate turnaround and shortly after started their next playoff game with the hosting team Ely. That game was still in progress when this edition went to press.


  Now officially in playoff mode, Lindseth says his squad has everything they need if they want to keep succeeding.


  “It’s tough mentally to be out here playing a lot of games in only a few days but our guys are just glad to be out here. I told them that they have the keys to the bus now and they have to drive it now. I can’t do anything more for them. But we’re excited about the opportunity to keep going.”


  Eveleth-Gilbert lost 12-4 in their second game Saturday and will play at noon in an elimination game. Their opponent had not been determined as this edition went to press.

Before signing Cam Newton to a one-year deal worth up to $7.5 million, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick wanted to do his homework on the veteran quarterback.
 The Patriots were familiar with the 31-year-old who has played nine seasons in the NFL. In fact, Newton has beaten Belichick's New England teams the two times they've faced one another. This summer, however, the Patriots coach wanted to learn more about the eccentric former NFL MVP.
 On Friday, Belichick spoke to the local media for the first time since April. He revealed that the Pats did a lot of homework on Newton. That included meeting with the quarterback and talking to people who knew him to see if he would be a fit for New England.
 As it turns out, the reports on Newton were all positive and Belichick seemed eager to get the veteran into training camp, which starts on Saturday with a ramp-up period of strength and conditioning.
 "Things worked out," Belichick said. "We spent quite a bit of time with Cam. He spent quite a bit of time with us. I think it was a mutual interest.
 "We spent quite a bit of [time with] a number of different people and a number of different conversations just trying to see how the fit would be. It was very positive on our end and I'm glad it worked out."
 For the first time in Belichick's career in New England, the coach heads into the summer with a true quarterback competition after Tom Brady signed with Tampa Bay in free agency. You'd have to go back to 1992 (the year before Drew Bledsoe was drafted) to find a time druing which there was any uncertainty in camp as to who would start at quarterback for the Patriots. That year saw four quarterbacks start -- Hugh Millen, Scott Zolak, Tom Hodson and Jeff Carlson.
 Now, the Patriots head into camp with four quarterbacks -- Newton, Jarrett Stidham, Brian Hoyer and Brian Lewerke. Unlike most offseasons, the Patriots' coaching staff hasn't seen any of these players throw the ball. In the past, there would have been organized team activities, or OTAs, and minicamp -- totaling about 10 practices -- for players to get a feel for the playbook and to get to know their teammates. Because of the pandemic, those practices were canceled and players engaged only in virtual meetings.
 Newton signed with the Pats after the virtual meetings ended, but that hasn't stopped him from playing catch-up. Newton has worked out with several Patriots players in California. In New England, Newton had a workout with receivers Julian Edelman, N'Keal Harry, Jakobi Meyers, Damiere Byrd and Gunner Olszewski. He's also worked out with Mohamed Sanu and Devin Asiasi.
 Of course, Stidham still has a chance in this competition. He had a solid summer last year when he beat out Hoyer for the top backup job. When he was asked if it was hard to judge how much Stidham has developed, Belichick said that all players are truly in the same boat.
 "Everybody missed those. That's what it is. It's the same for everybody," Belichick said. "That's the way it went this year and that's the way it went in 2011 [during the lockout]. Some years are different than other years. There's nothing we can do about that. We can't change it. We just try to make the most out of every opportunity we get going forward. That's all we can do."
 When it comes to scouting the quarterbacks on the roster, the Patriots won't have games to judge their play since the preseason has been canceled. When he was asked how that will change things for the Patriots and analyzing their own players, Belichick said it'll be like college, where teams practice and hold scrimmages up until their first games.
 Belichick made it clear that he wouldn't comment too much on the quarterback competition. When he was asked if the team would change its offensive playbook to fit a certain quarterback's style, the coach said the Patriots will do what they've always done since 2000 -- teach all players the "certain fundamentals and basics in our offensive, defensive and special teams systems that need to be taught."
 As it pertains to the quarterback competition, the Patriots coach says it's simple.
 "That spot is the same as all the other spots on the team. We have a long way to go and we'll see how things turn out.
 "I can't control how players perform. That's up to them. We'll give everybody an opportunity and see what happens."

BRYANT, Mildred Mildred Kathleen Bonner Bryant passed away at the age of 98 on July 22, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Mildred was born on October 26, 1921 in Clovis, New Mexico. She was the daughter of Thomas and Mildred Bonner. She grew up in Clovis, where she attended high school. After completing high school, Mildred attended Eastern New Mexico College in Portales, New Mexico and then Baylor University School of Nursing in Dallas, Texas. It was at Baylor that Mildred met her husband, Dr. David Bryant. Mildred and David were married on November 6th , 1943. They shared 55 years together, for the most part living in Bridgeport, Texas where Dr. Bryant practiced family medicine. Together, Mildred and David raised three children. Not only was Mildred a devoted wife and mother, she dedicated much time to civic duties in Bridgeport. She served on the school board for 13 years, was on the board of the Bridgeport Chamber of Commerce in addition to being very involved in the First Presbyterian Church. Perhaps what people will remember most about her is her passion for dogs; and her involvement in the sport of purebred dogs. She established Milbryan Kennels in 1958 and began breeding and exhibiting dogs, focusing on Cairn Terriers, Lhasa Apsos, Sealyham Terriers, Dachshunds and Doberman Pinschers. During her time as a breeder, she enjoyed much success in the show ring as owner or co-owner of 89 champions. She served twice as president of the Cairn Terrier Club of America and was a past delegate to the American Kennel Club. She was a member of the Ft. Worth Kennel Club and charter member of the North Texas Terrier Club. "Milly," as she was often called, began her career judging dog shows in 1969 and at that time stopped breeding and exhibiting in order to focus on judging. Mildred's judging assignments took her all over the United States and included international assignments in Mexico, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Argentina and Colombia. Mildred will also forever be known for her love of turquoise jewelry, a nod to her New Mexico upbringing. She always had turquoise on no matter the occasion. She loved to needlepoint and play bridge. During their 55 years of marriage, Mildred and David travelled the world. Their travels included Europe, the Greek Islands, sailing on the Amazon River, and visiting the Great Pyramid at Giza. She loved to spoil her three grandchildren, who affectionately called her "Big Mama." They adored her magnanimous personality and always knew they could depend on their "Big Mama" for laughter and fun times- and sometimes for things their parents said "no" such as a new dog. Mildred is preceded in death by her husband, David, son Dr. David W. Bryant, II, and daughter Karen Sue Bryant White. She is survived by her daughter, Cindy Bryant Elder, son-in-law, Dr. William Elder along with grandchildren Allison Elder Dickey and her husband Cullen, David Austin White and his wife Ana and Lexie Elder Aderhold and her husband Cullen. Mildred had three beloved great grandchildren, Warren Dickey, Tripp and Lou Lou Aderhold. The family would like to thank The Good Samaritan Village in Denton, Texas and The Forum in Dallas, Texas for their good care of Mildred during her last years. A graveside service is planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests any memorial donations be sent to the American Kennel Club's Take the Lead Program or their Canine Health Foundation.

While the first steps of the journey to Alabama's 2020 football schedule is complete, there is still some distance to cover and, as always, it's a trip the Crimson Tide must make carrying the burden of history.


   


  Alabama knows how many games it will play (10, all from the Southeastern Conference) and when they will start (September 26). The dates for specific games that were on the previous schedule may stay more or less the same, but Alabama and Georgia, who can clearly no longer remain on September 19, has to move, maybe to a date a week later, or maybe somewhere deeper in the schedule.


   


  There are two vacancies to fill with two new East Division opponents and that's where the questions begin, possibly untainted by politics and possibly not. One idea that had been in fairly wide circulation had been to simply have each team add the next two teams upcoming on their SEC rotation -- for Alabama, that would mean Florida and Vanderbilt. That method would be based on a rotation determined years ago and while it might not be entirely equal, it would at least be devoid of political and competitive bias.


   


  It wouldn't make everyone happy, though. No model is going to make everyone happy. Greg Sankey said on Thursday that various models are being considered, but all models are only as good as the data that goes into them.


   


  Alabama's particular problem is two-fold. The first is, going into 2020, the Crimson Tide is once again the preseason favorite to win the league and none of the five East Division teams (Kentucky, South Carolina and Missouri in addition to Florida and Vandy) are going to like that very much.


   


  The second is the idea, strongly held in some parts, that the league office "favors" Alabama. Entire books have been written on the Alabama/SEC bias in Louisiana alone, some even in English. So no matter what the SEC ultimately decides, if it can in any way be perceived as "favorable" to Alabama, there will be billboards purchased and columns written among the low grumbling.


   


  Alabama already has the East Division favorite, Georgia, and an improving Tennessee team on its schedule. The popular perception would be that Florida is in next team in the hypothetical pecking order and pairing the Crimson Tide and the Gators would please everyone except, of course, Dan Mullen and the Gators, who are already set to play LSU and Ole Miss.


   


  The solution to that knotty problem would be easier to discern if one knew what the priority for the SEC would be. If the goal is NFL-style parity scheduling, where everyone ideally finishes at .500 or a bit above, you'd simply have the best teams add the other best team from the other division. The problem there is that the NFL determines a champion with a playoff system that a team at 10-6 or even 9-7 has a reasonable chance to participate in. The SEC needs a clearly dominant champion -- not undefeated, perhaps, but better than 8-3, to make the College Football Playoff in the current four-game format. So if you stack the schedule of your best contenders -- if you throw LSU into Georgia's slate to go with Alabama and Auburn, for example -- are you helping yourself? Do you try to make teams happy to get to 6-4, if 6-4 doesn't pay off in the postseason.


   


  The final schedule will not make all 14 teams happy. That's a certainty. What will be interesting will be whether a certain philosophy prevails, or naked politics.

Opt for family health reasons instead.


  It means there will be more burden for Adam Gase and Sam Darnold to raise the Jets and assist defensive coordinator Gregg Williams' troops.


  No one can or should bother him, even when Jets fans complain that for a $ 85 million free agent, for $ 51 million guaranteed, Mosley has been on the field wearing his Jets 57 jersey for five quarters. He was owed $ 6M in base salary after receiving a $ 10M list bonus in March.


  For someone who loves the game as much as Mosley, you know it must have hurt to leave his team and teammates behind.


  "When you go through something you love so much, it's like learning to ride a bike," Mosley told ESPN in May. "You just don't want to stop."


  C.J. MosleyAP


  Unlike Jamal Adams, Mosley wanted to be part of the solution and he was like that with the Ravens long before he was paid.


  What makes Mosley, as quiet as Adams is loud, a bigger loss to the Jets in some ways than Adams.


  There is no argument that Adams was the team's best player, but Mosley was the brains behind Williams' defense.


  While Adams is an ardent leader on the field, Mosley provides professional leadership on and off the field. No wonder why the Ravens tried to convince him to stay. The boy was a four-time Pro Bowler in his five seasons in Baltimore.


  He is a tackle machine. He and Panthers ILB Luke Kuechly were the only two players in the NFL with 500 tackles, eight sacks and eight interceptions since 2014 when he joined the Jets.


  Gase was more excited about Mosley's signing than Le'Veon Bell's.


  "He wanted me to be the centerpiece of the defense to have a leadership role on and off the field," Mosley once said. "So I feel like my five years in Baltimore put me in this position to be a leader on and off the field and I'm excited to start this new journey."


  Mosley may have been a free agent signed by former general manager Mike Maccagnan, he may very well have been too rich for the pragmatic blood of current general manager Joe Douglas, but it cannot be argued that he is one of those tough, smart and selfless players. They can mean everything to a healthy, if not winning, culture.


  When Douglas was hired, he defined for me his idea of ​​his type of soccer player: "Rugged, he loves soccer, he has a burning passion for soccer, he is capable of handling criticism, he can come back from defeat, very smart, he can think under fire, able to keep his balance under fire. "


  That describes C.J. Mosley.


  Then Bradley McDougald replaces Adams. Perhaps Avery Williamson, who missed last season with a ripped ACL that suffered in the trash of the pointless preseason game, can replace Mosley.


  The Jets are lucky that Williams knows how to defend himself. And Quinnen Williams should have a bigger impact in his second season. Gregg Williams will continue to show his boys pictures of lions in the socially distant meeting rooms and make sure they roar out.


  Douglas had an excellent run for Adams. But Mosley choosing not to participate after Adams' launch to Seattle is an instinctive 1-2 hit that makes you think even more that 2020 will be a rebuilding season with more space available now in 2021. Gang Groan, earlier than usual.

HIBBING — If it is their last game, the Hibbing Babe Ruth Team No. 1 can at least say they won a game.


  The Hornets got some timely hitting and good pitching en route to a 9-8 victory over Hermantown Friday at Al Nyberg Field.


  Cole Mammenga picked up the pitching win, tossing seven innings of nine-hit ball. He struck out five and walked three.


  Hermantown pitcher Nick Harju was just as effective as he went six innings, giving up nine hits. He fanned eight and walked four.


  The Hornets finally put a complete game together.


  “It was a back-and-forth game between two comparable teams,” Hibbing coach Adam Schafer said. “Early on, we gave them some free runs, but I commend our guys for their resiliency.


  “They stayed in the game for a full seven, so that was the biggest thing, seven innings of focus. They got the job done. I was proud of that effort, and I’m happy they can end their season with a win.”


  That win wouldn’t come easy as the Hawks would jump on the board first as Harju singled with one out and stole second. Eli Hedin laced a double to the left-center field gap to make it 1-0.


  Mammenga stranded runners on first and third by getting to pop outs.


  Hibbing responded in its half of the first as Noah Vinopal, who would finish with four hits, singled, and Ryley Lund singled. Will Durie laced an RBI base hit, then Mammenga bombed a three-run home run over the left-field wall and it was 4-1.


  Hermantown would take the lead in the third with four runs led by an RBI singles by Ian Ritchie and Sam Plante. One run scored on an error and the other on a balk.


  Trailing 5-4, the Hornets opened their half of the third with back-to-back walks to Durie and Mammenga. Codieh Powers singled to load the bases. Dan Rusten drew an RBI walk, then Ethan Lund hit an RBI fielder’s choice ground ball.


  After a walk to Brody Niskanen, Isaac Erickson hit a sacrifice fly, then Vinopal singled home a run to give Hibbing an 8-5 lead.


  Schafer liked the way his team handled themselves after falling behind twice in the game.


  “They were resilient, and they knew they were hitting the ball hard,” Schafer said. “Their kid threw well, but we were squaring him up. We had a lot of good barrel contact. They knew that three or four down, that they were on the kid, and they had an opportunity to stay in the game.


  “I liked the resilience they showed.”


  Hermantown wasn’t finished as it scored twice in the fourth, one crossing the plate on an error, and the other on a fielder’s choice ground ball hit by Ritchie.


  The Hawks tied it the game 8-8 in the fifth as Wyatt Carlson singled, then Plante singled him to third. Josh Summers hit an RBI fielder’s choice ground ball to even things up.


  “That’s been the story of our summer,” Schafer said. “We get a lead, then it goes back the other way. We didn’t get to a point of mentally breaking down and not finishing. That was the resilient part of it.


  “We made sure we stayed on them for seven innings. That was good to see.”


  Mammenga had a one-two-three sixth inning, then with the top of their order coming up, the Hornets took a one-run lead heading into the seventh.


  Vinopal doubled to start the inning. Lund would get an infield single, and when the ball was thrown down the right field line, Vinopal scored the go- ahead run.


  “Noah had a great game at the plate,” Schafer said. “It was one of those things where the top of the order being the table setters. He started it off with the double, then the guys behind him did their job, moving him over and getting him in.


  “It was good timely baseball. That’s how you draw it up, and it worked out. That was exciting. I’m happy for the guys.”


  It looked like Hermantown might tie the game in the top of the seventh when Ritchie doubled, but his pinch runner was picked off second for the first out of the inning.


  Mammenga then got a pop out and ground out to preserve the win.


  Vinopal led Hibbing with those four hits, including two doubles and triple. Lund had two hits. Plante had three hits for the Hawks. Hedin had two doubles. Ritchie had two hits as did Carlson.

In the days of our 2020 quarantine when so much came to a halt, an uncanny silence became notable. Flights overhead were rare. Traffic on roadways and rails nearly ceased. It was the perfect moment for an amazing symphonic crescendo in the avian world. Songs and calls in the woods and across expanses of acreage stood out quite notably. I remarked to Karen about our good fortune in having both cover and open space around us. I was ushered back to my earliest life memories with birds.


  Many of my early boyhood summer nights were spent sleeping on my grandfather’s screened porch. His small coastal farmstead was graced with grand oaks and tall pines. Early to bed meant the evening transition as some birds headed for their roosts and nests while dusk introduced the nocturnally gifted along with other woodsy chatter. It was a wondrous way to get a restful night. Dawn brought an early excitement to the new morning as the wooded areas came alive with activity, song as well as call among the birds I’d begun to regard as my special friends. This spring and summer have connected me with those early years of observation and listening. One of our Hill Country gifts that bring so many surprises with the seasons is the rich variety and rotation of the birds that share life near our rivers and creeks as well as in the canopied cover near and far. Several have nested and displayed their offspring with caution nearby. Others have come and gone this way in seasonal migratory journeys.

I do believe that many people now understand that reading is fundamental. Learning how to break down words in order to pronounce them correctly is so very basic. Carver's premier high school English teacher, Ms. B.T. Webb, drilled all of this into your head. You were not going to get by her staunch insistence that you speak well and pronounce words as they were meant to be pronounced; pause when there was a comma; and have some inflection in your voice when reading aloud.


   


  Ms. Webb is surely spinning in her grave if she can see or hear the current occupant of the White House read the teleprompter. There is no voice modulation. It is flat, hollow and dull. Words are mispronounced and sentences are continuously repeated. It is tortuous to witness as you hope that some important information will be revealed. It does not help that he did not write the words, nor does he believe what he is reading in the latest changes in his rhetoric about the coronavirus and the upcoming convention.


   


  I am a huge proponent of education. Kindergarten through 12th grade provides the foundation for things yet to come in a young person's life. Teachers live on in the lives of those whom they taught during those years. I know computers and their offspring have produced a different kind of learning. I respond by saying that reading, writing and mathematics still form a necessary basis for whatever choice a young person makes for a lifetime career.


   


  A good, decent, basic education doesn't mean preparation for a four-year college experience. I see great value in the trades. When your automobile refused to cooperate, you did not seek out a doctor or a lawyer. When your air conditioning refused to let you be comfortable in the Southern heat, I doubt that my law degree could help you. What if your plumbing decided that it did not care if your home was flooded, or that you could not access the water that you pay dearly for?


   


  I could give you a litany of those things that you know that you have experienced. I am not the only one; these things stay in my mind because two different people who came to my rescue talked to me about how tradespeople seem to be given no respect for what they do. One was Caucasian and the other was African American. They were smart, thoughtful men.


   


  Educators, elected officials and parents are faced with some difficult choices. Choosing a trade does not forego the need for a basic, good education. You must be able to communicate well. I have to be able to read the bill that you leave me.


   


  There is a school crisis, virtual or in person. It is one of the worst decisions that anyone would have to make. Teachers, school employees and children all have the right to be safe. During this pandemic, what happens in a school does not stay there. It is carried to the rest of the family. The coronavirus does not discriminate when it comes to finding a host.


   


  The debate over returning to school or working on the job site or at home, closing businesses, job losses, overruns on the health care industry and fear over the future rages on. However angry or frustrated you become, place the blame where it belongs. The United States would not be in this hideous position if in January or February of this year, action had been taken based upon science and the great disease specialist that America has. If this disease had not been tagged a "Democratic hoax" or "fake news," and literally ignored for months, we would be ahead of the curve.


   


  With the demand to open schools and the economy at any cost, where do the administration proponents of this concept send their children to school? Most are in upscale private schools, or the parents can afford private tutoring. Education is critical. With short cutting of words in tests and other communications, many people (not just children) cannot spell, nor can they read. What happened to reading labs? A 6-year-old child should already know how to read upon entering first grade. Suffice it to say that my contemporaries could read when we started first grade. Ms. Ethel Mae's Kindergarten ensured that we could read, write and spell. That was our Head Start program.


   


  The sad part about all of the "fully open the schools," "fully open the economy" and "send federal troops without a plan to major cities," they are born of an attempt to bolster ratings in the polls. No feel for anybody or anything, just a need for a rating increase. Let's appeal to the worst in our base.

He said the protests were breeding grounds for the virus that were being allowed to take place with no limits, shutting down streets and neighborhoods. He said right-wing protests have not been given such free rein.


  He condemned violence “from all sides” at the start of his remarks before tearing into the media he has long viewed as hostile toward him.


  Also at the Cabinet meeting, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who is the country's “alternate” prime minister under a power-sharing deal, said the protests must be allowed to take place with protesters shielded from violence.


  “The right to protest is the lifeblood of democracy and violence is the erosion of the foundation of democracy,” he said.


  Netanyahu's tirade came as his son Yair Netanyahu was summoned to a Jerusalem court after tweeting the names, addresses and phone numbers of prominent protesters, calling his followers to demonstrate outside their homes “day and night.” The court granted the 28-year-old Netanyahu an exemption from appearing in court. Protesters said they received threatening calls after the tweet.


  Throughout the summer, thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets, calling for Netanyahu to resign, protesting his handling of the country’s coronavirus crisis and saying he should not remain in office while on trial for corruption charges. Though Netanyahu has tried to play down the protests, the twice-a-week gatherings show no signs of slowing and Saturday night's Jerusalem gathering drew more than 10,000 people.

Wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt over a shirt he ordered to say "Equality," and as all the other coaches and players around him knelt, Leonard stood up to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" the Saturday before the Heat. . He opened his season facing the Denver Nuggets at Walt Disney World.


  "Some of the conversations that I've had in the last three days have literally been the most difficult," Leonard told The Associated Press before the game. "I am with the Black Lives Matter movement and I love and support the military, my brother, and the people who have fought to defend our rights in this country."


  Leonard dealt with anxiety and insomnia for several days as he agonized over the decision. He explained his reasoning before Saturday to his current teammates and several exes, almost all black, and then stood about halfway down the court, giving him his heart, as the song played.


  "I am a compassionate human being and I really love all people," said Leonard. "I cannot fully understand how our world has literally and figuratively become black and white. There is a line in the sand, so to speak:" If you are not kneeling, you are not with us. "And that is not true.


  "I will continue to use my platform, my voice and my actions to show how much I care about African American culture and for everyone," he added. "I live my life to serve and impact others in a positive way."

  The goal of this restarted NBA season, interrupted for more than 4 and a half months by the coronavirus pandemic, has been to continue to illuminate the need for racial justice and an end to police brutality. NBA teams kneel, often joining arms, over the prerecorded national anthem along a side line where "Black Lives Matter" is painted.


  Orlando Magic forward Jonathan Isaac, who is black, defended the anthem before his team's game on Friday and chose not to wear the "Black Lives Matter" shirt that players and coaches have donned at Disney for the pre- ceremony. to the game.


  Later on Friday, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich and Spurs assistant Becky Hammon performed the anthem. Popovich, a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, stood with his arms at his side. Hammon placed his arms on fellow assistant Will Hardy and Spurs guard Patty Mills.


  "I felt like they were taking a little weight off me when they did that," Leonard said. "Each of those individuals had their own personal reasons, just like me."


  Heat striker Andre Iguodala, a member of the executive committee of the National Basketball Players Association, said he respected Leonard's choice.


  "On the one hand, we are saying," We want them to see things from our perspective, "" Iguodala said. “But in saying that, I also have to see things from his perspective. And I can see where it comes from. "


  Heat captain Udonis Haslem had multiple conversations with Leonard in recent days about his decision. Haslem has made several things clear; Originally he wanted to see Leonard kneeling, but after those conversations he came out understanding and promised that the Heat would support his teammate.


  When the song ended, Haslem was the first to fist with Leonard.


  "The fact that he is there with us, like our brother, continues to show strength, continues to show unity, continues to show that we are uniting for a common cause," Haslem said. "People will ask themselves, 'Why aren't you doing it your way? "Well, he's by our side. He's supporting us. He's with us."


  Haslem has seen Leonard's commitment to help others. Leonard raised $ 180,000 in April by streaming himself playing video games online; That money went to causes like Feeding South Florida, a group that Haslem and the Heat worked closely with.


  And on Saturday, Leonard said that he and his wife will donate $ 100,000 to a fund that helps pay the fees that Floridians who leave jails or prisons must settle before they can restore their voting rights.


  "As I have heard Udonis and am constantly inspired by him, each of those dollars will go to Overtown and Liberty City, where he grew up," said Leonard, referring to two of Miami's historic black neighborhoods. "Those two parts of Miami were the most affected by COVID-19 and voter suppression."


  Heat striker Jimmy Butler also tried to make a statement on Saturday, walking onto the court in a shirt with no name on the back. He unsuccessfully pressured the NBA to play on a jersey with only one number, and he had to change to a jersey with his name before the game could begin.


  Former teammates have warned Leonard that he can deal with criticism, possibly from other NBA players. His eyes filled with tears many times in the past few days as he worked on the decision, his reaction was so strong that he trembled as he explained his choice to the Heat teammates.


  It was not an easy decision. It may not be popular.


  But on Saturday morning, a few hours before the hymn, Bailey Leonard, the former Marine, texted his brother and said, "Be true to yourself. Stay the course. I love you. Your family loves you. Your community loves you. "


  If Leonard had any doubts, he evaporated there.


  "I know he is proud of me," said Leonard. "And if he is proud of me, and if my brothers on this team are with me, then I know this is what I have to do."

Indigent defense in the United States is a state-by-state system with no national standards. Criminal defendants are often forgotten when it comes time to trim a state budget, and indigent defense services most often feel the pinch. A recent report on Michigan’s indigent defense services found a system that is wholly incapable of upholding a defendant’s Constitutional right to adequate defense counsel. The report, prepared by the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, found: _“ … judges handpicking defense attorneys; lawyers appointed to cases for which they are unqualified; defenders meeting clients on the eve of trial and holding non-confidential discussions in public courtroom corridors; attorneys failing to identify obvious conflicts of interest; failure of defenders to properly prepare for trials or sentencings; attorneys violating their ethical canons by not zealously advocating for clients; inadequate compensation for those appointed to defend the accused …” _

Natick Police Chief James Hicks wishes more people understood that television police procedural dramas don't accurately reflect his profession.


  "'Chicago PD,' you see police officers who are skirting the rules, and it's OK because at the end of the day, they look like heroes, and they save the day," he said. "(Actual officers) have to have the highest of integrity … and they have to understand they're totally under the microscope, as we should be."


  Moved by state and nationwide demands for reform following the deaths of people of color at the hands of police, Massachusetts lawmakers have proposed new legislation in recent weeks. Key to state reform is the idea of accreditation - creating a set of standards all police departments will have to follow.


  "I think, in general, Massachusetts police leaders are very progressive and very innovative," said Brenda Bond-Fortier, a National Police Foundation research fellow and Suffolk University professor of public administration. But she also said current policies might not hold water in departments with less progressive leaders.


  Moving to a national accreditation agency, such as the Virginia-based Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, could allow for more specificity, as well as nationwide consistency, she said.


  Local police say their departments already have access to an accreditation system. Police chiefs have kept the formerly state-run Massachusetts Police Accreditation Commission operating since 2004, when the Legislature cut its funding just eight years after its creation. As of this past year, 211 municipal and college police departments are either accredited by the nonprofit, or have begun the process, including at least 15 in Greater Milford and MetroWest.


  "The chiefs continued it on our own," Hicks said. "The rhetoric that's coming up now, it doesn't take into account we do a lot of these things that they ask for … for years with no support."


  There should be reform, Hicks said, but police should be at the table as it's crafted.


  "That's an insult," Hicks said, of police not being a core part of the reform process, "because we've been doing it for years … without any support from the Legislature. I think our record is good."

Framingham, Holliston, Marlborough, Northborough, Southborough and Upton are all accredited through the nonprofit, and nine more Milford and MetroWest towns, plus Framingham State University and Weston's Regis College are listed as working toward the designation.


  A Daily News record request found that department policies in Greater Milford and MetroWest, particularly codes of conduct, ethics and lists of what officers can be punished for and how, closely mirror one another. Local police chiefs say that's at least in part because of the accreditation process.


  "Accreditation is a goal for pretty much every department in the commonwealth," Hicks said. "I say 'goal' because it takes a while to get there."


  Most local policies include the code of ethics adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which is written in the first person and includes the familiar promise to protect and serve, as well as thorough language about being a good person and good role model.


  Backing up the code


  Bond-Fortier warned against such broad language in police policies, when not backed up by specifics and consequences.


  "We would want to see policies that are grounded in some kind of standard or best practice. … Sort of generally being a good person is not enough," she said. "I think the vagueness allows for a lot of discretion for police."


  In Greater Milford and MetroWest, that code of ethics is echoed throughout departments' codes of conduct, and specific offenses are laid out, along with consequences. Officers are held accountable for their on- and off-duty behavior; are required to be as courteous as the situation allows; cannot smoke on or off duty or be late for work; and must be careful about even the appearance of conflicts of interest or using their influence to benefit themselves.


  "Being a positive role model is very important to being a good police officer," Marlborough police spokesman Sgt. Zachary Attaway said. "That carries over, obviously, both on and off duty for us."


  Uniform requirements include about a page on allowed hairstyles specific to men and women, proper care and wear, and whether officers can wear earrings - men, no; women, studs only.


  A catch-all offense, "conduct unbecoming an officer," can be used when no defined rule has been violated, but the officer clearly acted against the spirit of the policies and intention of the profession.


  Policies repeatedly warn officers not to do anything that reflects poorly on the department.


  "Believe it or not … there's very strong peer pressure to do the right thing," said Ashland Police Chief Vincent Alfano. "If you tarnish the badge, or you taint the badge, that's everyone else's badge."


  Additionally, Alfano said, a department's good reputation is important to officers' jobs.


  "If (residents) don't respect the people who are in charge of protecting you or enforcing the law … you cannot effectively do your job," he said.


  The code of conduct isn't just a stack of paperwork in Massachusetts. Basic standards are drilled into aspiring officers in mandatory state-run academies, and new recruits must undergo background checks, plus an interview with department brass and other leaders in local government.


  "Different parts of the country have different standards, as far as their police hiring process, their screening and their training," Alfano said. "In Massachusetts, it is very difficult to become a police officer."


  With so many ways to violate the code of conduct, the system is set up to catch bad behavior early and either correct it or kick the person out of the academy or off a department.


  Depending on the severity of the violation, consequences range from counseling to warnings to suspension, then termination.


  "Working in society and working with communities is complex, because it's so diverse," Hicks said. Of people aspiring to be police officers, "They need to be ready for that. Some are not, and we're able to weed them out during the process."


  Good people are an important part of the process, too. The written policies and procedures reinforce responsible hiring and ethical decision-making, but departments and municipal leadership have to make the final call on a person.


  "(Police) have the ability to take people's liberties, they have a right to arrest, they have the ability … in the right circumstance, to take a life," said Hicks. "That's a huge responsibility. We need to ensure we have the right people in place."


  Discipline happens


  The Daily News' record request found that between 2016 and 2020, members of local police departments were disciplined 163 times at 16 departments in Greater Milford and MetroWest. Most of those disciplined were police officers, but at least one town provided data for non-sworn members of the department.


  Offense categories are wide-ranging. Officers can be disciplined for violations of the policies as obvious as breaking the law or excessive force in an arrest, as well as being late for a shift, rudeness or reading on the job. Additionally, discipline isn't restricted to serious repercussions like suspensions or terminations. It includes the full spectrum of addressing an issue, such as "verbal counseling," meaning an officer's superior could have explained the importance of being on time, or how to avoid coming across as rude during a traffic stop.


  In the 16 towns and cities that responded to the Daily News' request, offenses in the time period requested ranged from "unbecoming and criminal conduct" for an off-duty car crash to "insubordination," to "reporting late for duty." Westborough did not report any discipline in that time period.


  "It makes me cringe, when I hear members of the Legislature (saying) 'we have Black and brown people laying in the street who are shot and killed by a police officer.' It makes me cringe, because it's not happening in Massachusetts," Hicks said. "But I'm also one of those saying, 'It's not happening here, but it could happen tomorrow.'"


  Offense categories are also broad, however, meaning it can be difficult to tell if "offense unbecoming an officer" or the even broader "policy and procedure violation" is a minor or major transgression.


  Increased apprehension


  People are naturally apprehensive around police officers, chiefs said, because officers typically show up when something bad has happened. When that apprehension crosses the line into fear, it's the job of the police to fix that, Hicks said.


  "That's hard. It's difficult work," he said. "It takes a lot of effort, and it takes the right mindset to do that, and you have to train that to all your members."


  Officers have to learn to walk the line between being respected enough to encourage citizens to follow the law, and approachable enough for residents to feel comfortable coming to them for help.


  "That's why we stress so much with our police officers, and we actually look for personality types … people with good communication skills," Alfano said. "Communication skills can help us more effectively deal with what we do."


  Attaway said he goes out of his way to interact with people, especially children, who appear nervous around police.


  "We (try) to show people we are people, too," he said. "We're dads, moms and we're coaches as well."


  Community policing, when officers get into their communities without a negative reason - from toy drives to "positive tickets" for children caught doing good, to the school resource officer, to just talking to citizens - is a huge part of making people comfortable with their local police force.


  "We're the most visible part of government," Alfano said. "(Residents) don't know who their legislators are … but they sure know who their police officers are. We have to understand that our actions are always going to be judged."


  Alfano called community policing "a power that can be used for good."


  "There's a need for reform. There definitely is, and there has been for years," Hicks said. "From the law enforcement perspective, the time was 10 years ago to be talking about this."


  Police departments and their chiefs do not operate in isolation, Bond-Fortier pointed out. Talk of reform should also hold municipal leaders, from mayors and town administrators to city councils and select boards, accountable.


  "I think it's important to really stress that there's very little talk about the role of municipal leaders," she said. "Municipal leaders should be expected to be as active in this conversation about police reform, because they're involved around a lot of the decisions."

BRYANT, Mildred Mildred Kathleen Bonner Bryant passed away at the age of 98 on July 22, 2020 in Dallas, Texas. Mildred was born on October 26, 1921 in Clovis, New Mexico. She was the daughter of Thomas and Mildred Bonner. She grew up in Clovis, where she attended high school. After completing high school, Mildred attended Eastern New Mexico College in Portales, New Mexico and then Baylor University School of Nursing in Dallas, Texas. It was at Baylor that Mildred met her husband, Dr. David Bryant. Mildred and David were married on November 6th , 1943. They shared 55 years together, for the most part living in Bridgeport, Texas where Dr. Bryant practiced family medicine. Together, Mildred and David raised three children. Not only was Mildred a devoted wife and mother, she dedicated much time to civic duties in Bridgeport. She served on the school board for 13 years, was on the board of the Bridgeport Chamber of Commerce in addition to being very involved in the First Presbyterian Church. Perhaps what people will remember most about her is her passion for dogs; and her involvement in the sport of purebred dogs. She established Milbryan Kennels in 1958 and began breeding and exhibiting dogs, focusing on Cairn Terriers, Lhasa Apsos, Sealyham Terriers, Dachshunds and Doberman Pinschers. During her time as a breeder, she enjoyed much success in the show ring as owner or co-owner of 89 champions. She served twice as president of the Cairn Terrier Club of America and was a past delegate to the American Kennel Club. She was a member of the Ft. Worth Kennel Club and charter member of the North Texas Terrier Club. "Milly," as she was often called, began her career judging dog shows in 1969 and at that time stopped breeding and exhibiting in order to focus on judging. Mildred's judging assignments took her all over the United States and included international assignments in Mexico, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Argentina and Colombia. Mildred will also forever be known for her love of turquoise jewelry, a nod to her New Mexico upbringing. She always had turquoise on no matter the occasion. She loved to needlepoint and play bridge. During their 55 years of marriage, Mildred and David travelled the world. Their travels included Europe, the Greek Islands, sailing on the Amazon River, and visiting the Great Pyramid at Giza. She loved to spoil her three grandchildren, who affectionately called her "Big Mama." They adored her magnanimous personality and always knew they could depend on their "Big Mama" for laughter and fun times- and sometimes for things their parents said "no" such as a new dog. Mildred is preceded in death by her husband, David, son Dr. David W. Bryant, II, and daughter Karen Sue Bryant White. She is survived by her daughter, Cindy Bryant Elder, son-in-law, Dr. William Elder along with grandchildren Allison Elder Dickey and her husband Cullen, David Austin White and his wife Ana and Lexie Elder Aderhold and her husband Cullen. Mildred had three beloved great grandchildren, Warren Dickey, Tripp and Lou Lou Aderhold. The family would like to thank The Good Samaritan Village in Denton, Texas and The Forum in Dallas, Texas for their good care of Mildred during her last years. A graveside service is planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests any memorial donations be sent to the American Kennel Club's Take the Lead Program or their Canine Health Foundation.

A discovery master is a lawyer or retired judge who all discovery disputes are brought before instead of trying to get in front of the judge hearing your case. They can be an invaluable tool. Yes, they charge fees, but the cost is less than going to court. Given the state of the court system in light of the pandemic where many judges are still not hearing anything that is not an emergency, a discovery dispute can stop any forward progress in the overall case. You cannot get to the step of a pretrial conference or trial dates if you do not first engage in discovery. You need someone who can be easily accessed to make her engage.

George Floyd’s killing at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer recently settled into a three-word manifesto to “Defund the police.” Like all good slogans, it packs many meanings into small space, and might yet reduce police resources. And while this reform was triggered by one kind of plague, another — COVID-19 — seems poised to catalyze change in the U.S. military.
 Cops and troops, of course, aren’t the same. But both are high stakes providers of protection — one local, one global — and the tinder-awaiting- spark of systemic change similarly surrounds the U.S. military.
 COVID-19’s killed many more Americans than the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq combined, and generated massive unemployment triggering comparisons to the Great Depression. It’s hard to imagine status quo sticking at the Pentagon.

 Trump's duty to send agents to Portland
   
 In reference to the July 30 letter, "Troops in Portland violating Constitution," the president has a sworn duty to protect the people of the United States and federal properties. President Donald Trump sent Department of Homeland Security agents (not troops) to Portland to protect the federal courthouse.
   
 The president does not require state approval to protect federal assets. A fence was erected around the federal courthouse. The rioters tore down the fence and attempted to burn the courthouse.
   
 The DHS agents came out to remove the trespassers and were attacked. A number of agents have been injured and three of them may be permanently blinded by rioters' laser lights. On one occasion, a wall of mothers joined the rioters to protect them. The rioters attacked the agents from behind their shield.
   
 Why is our president being attacked for defending property that belongs to all of us? Why is our local paper publishing a false headline and letter?
   
 I think that most of us are aware of the proven cases where the media has fed us false or misleading information. I hope that everyone will take the time to investigate reports and not just jump on the bandwagon of the first report that coincides with their opinion.

 Don't forget children warehoused in camps
   
 President Donald Trump is a master of distractions. For every outrageous thing he does, he then manages to distract us by doing or saying something even more egregious, hoping we'll forget the past.
   
 I, for one, am not forgetting about the sad children wasting away their childhood, warehoused in his child concentration camps, the children he stole from the parents who came to the U.S. believing they would find a better life for their families.
   
 Separating them was a heartless, pointless thing to do. These children are in their formative, learning years. Are they receiving any education? Are they learning about love, kindness and trust?
   
 I think they are learning that power is king, that lying, bullying and brown- nosing are the ways to get ahead. As they reach adulthood, will these traumatized young people, from no-man's-land, be dumped back on their birth countries, or become fodder for our prisons?
   
 Thinking ahead is not a strong point of the Trump administration. What is the plan here, President Trump?

 Partisan politics infect race for School Board
   
 I firmly believe that partisan politics has no place on the School Board. The School Board should always be working in the best interests of the students, teachers and staff, and the community.
   
 The School Board election is supposed to be nonpartisan just for that reason. I decided to run in this year's election because of the chaos and divisiveness last year, which was caused in part by the partisan politics on the board.
   
 Now partisan politics has infected the 2020 School Board election.
   
 Like many of you, I am a proud polling place voter. I find going to my polling place and making my voice heard fills me with pride.
   
 I have voted in many elections over the years. However, I did miss the March 2018 election, when a school referendum vote was held. Since then, I request vote-by-mail ballots, and I recommend that you do, too. I will always be able to cast my vote no matter what happens now.

Pune The coronavirus situation has forced the shift towards online classes. Is online education the best way to assess a child's academic progress? What are the pros and cons of brick-and-mortar and virtual classrooms? Readers share their take on the 'homebound' form of education...Redesign entire systemCovid-19 has given us time to rethink and redesign our education system. What is important for our kids nowadays, what they have to learn or understand for survival. The online education can be a substitute for a few days but can't be a reality as it impacts on an individual in different ways. For living a healthy life, not only food but our surroundings and environment are equally important. Online classes will never be a healthier or fruitful option for human beings as it will somehow stop our thinking and understanding ability. It will affect our nature and behaviour as well. The kids in the future will never be caring, sharing or supportive. Never understand the value of happiness, sadness, fighting and friendship. For being a good human, we need to understand others. And that can't be possible without meeting each other and when kids are stopped from going to school due to this pandemic. How can we all assure that they are learning the right things or we are nurturing them in a proper manner is the main issue? It will create more depression in our upcoming generation which will affect our future and at the same time our country's progress. As per my understanding, virtual schools can be a part of our life for some time but never be a reality. Reshu Aggarwaal An alternative, not a normOnline education may be one of the alternatives but shouldn't be made mandatory. It is not possible for a single family to arrange smartphones or computers for every child in the family. Online education may only give expertise in technology but will reduce the practical, moral and physical movements of the body. Online studies will bring a lot of restrictions on everyone. As a small kid, it is very difficult to cope with such methods of studies. Also, we cannot exclude the fact that the internet is a privilege for many students. So just like there are provisions for minimum ration, a minimum data allowance for everyone should be mandatory. It should be made sure that technology reaches every village and every household if we are thinking about normalising online education. Rohan Shetty Maintaining class decorum a problem With the Covid-19 situation still bothering us, we feel helpless but have moved on with Work from home for adults and online classes for kids. But the only question that arises here is how much are we really benefitting from all this? Though we have come up with ways to keep the kids occupied, online classes seem to be taking a toll over the kids. They are exposed to screen time which parents would avoid as it might affect their eyes. Burning sensation in the eyes and watering of eyes are a few common symptoms. Teachers are also struggling as dealing with children virtually does make much sense, especially for children who are poor in academics. Internet connectivity issues, power cuts are the other problems we have to deal with. Maintaining class decorum is not possible in a virtual situation but the children are adapting themselves to the situation. Definitely it's going to be difficult to assess the child's academic progress because most teachers find parents prompting the children with the correct answer when it comes to online classes. The child is just learning without understanding the concepts thoroughly. So yes, in a way virtual classes are a boon and bane as well. Teachers are also stressed to find new methods to engage the attention of the student since being at home the child's concentration is diverted. With time and new technology, we will be able to do a better job. Once the initial teething stage is overcome hopefully there will be a vast improvement. Till then do the best with what you have. D Fernandes - ShewaleOnline tech not bad, balance is key In a normal situation, before the pandemic, we let technology take over our daily routine quite gradually, but perpetually. It did not occur to us before today, that we have a zillion apps explaining concepts to students, or informing parents about their ward's progress, that we're escalating so quickly in this domain- we have the wings of technology to fly. But right now, it's all happening in our absolute focus. It's no more peripheral. Virtual classrooms are the future. But is it thoroughly bad? I don't think so. Yes, the screen time will increase and you can never replace the good old socializing between students in person. But learning might become convenient, with the children comfortable in their own space. Constraints of long learning hours can be replaced with interspersed learning and self-exploration. Yet, the role of a teacher is indispensable. Virtual classrooms can be a challenge for teachers who aren't used to technology, but choosing technology over their share of experience and expertise cannot be called development. Hence, the focus should be on teachers' training, not on their replacement. What is 'normal' today was not normal yesterday, and hence, we cannot expect tomorrow to be like today either. Change is the only constant, and we have to strive to maintain a balance between technology and older values. Ankita Singh Teacher-student interaction missing As the Covid-19 pandemic has caught us all off-guard, I agree that the situation and time we are dealing with, there is a need to opt for virtual learning class. But, as per my opinion, classroom teaching is preferred over the virtual classes. As daily interaction between teachers and students help them not only to complete their syllabus easily but also helps them to learn another aspect of life such as moral, discipline and this further teaches them how to deal in real life with the people in a society. Adding to this, classroom learning will always remain the key priority as it helps one to be in a disciplined life and it is the best way to impart and share knowledge and education. Wherein, virtual learning provides a good substitute for classroom learning in the current situation where everything is shut due to Covid-19 pandemic. But, along with this, it comes with other distractions as well, as children also try to surf other sites once they are done with the class, and this might have bad impact on their eyes due to continuous gaze on a computer or phone screen. Both virtual learning and classroom learning have their own importance, as the current situation is the best example where students are still learning without hindrance or gap in their education. Shalini Sharma Kids' screen time has increasedVirtual classes are here to stay for a while till the schools reopen. I am a mother of a 15-year-old and can see how these virtual classes are affecting my child. I do understand that at times like these this is the only option and as a parent we too want our child to be safe at home and don't want to worry about them, hoping it normalises soon as it's taking a toll on them. My child is in class 10 and has board pressures so it gets further tricky. He spends the whole day in front of the computer screen. He has his school classes and then his tuitions all are virtual. He complains of his eyes hurting, backache and at times eats his meals in front of the computer. The discipline of the day has taken a back seat as there is no scheduled time for bath, food or relaxing or any other routine. Since they aren't going out of the house they have started to get hooked on to the games on the computer and phones. When they aren't studying they join their friends playing games on the screen. One can say the kids are 90 per cent of their time stuck to the screen. If this goes on for a longer time we will have the same physical and mental problems that an adult has who works on computer full day . Saroj SoparkarSchedule online classes for class 5 and aboveI agree that online classes should be taken but only from class 5 to class 10. Online classes are not that helpful for children till class 4 and parents have told kids not to use phone and other electronic gadgets because it is harmful to eyes. How we can force them to study for hours on mobile or tablet. Many schools are only taking online study to take heavy fees from parents. Atul JainHealth is wealth, safety first The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to begin online teaching. In the interest of students' health, we shifted to online teaching. I feel in order to keep our students safe, it's best they are at home and we continue with online teaching. There are pros and cons to the virtual classroom. As a teacher, I feel we have lost the personal touch. At the end of the day, we do not enjoy job satisfaction, which we did earlier. From a student's perspective, they began online learning enthusiastically, but now they are losing interest. and become moody at times. All said and done, the need of the hour is to be safe and health is wealth. Anita D'Cunha

Alonso went 1-for-5 with two strikeouts, and lost six running backs as his batting average dropped to .200. The current N.L. The Rookie of the Year now only has one hit in his last 11 at-bats and has not homered in the past five games, leaving the all-time rookie home run record of 53 hitting a home run for the season. Last year, Alonso had five home runs in his first 10 games.


  "He wants to do a lot out there, and you know how much he cares," said Mets manager Luis Rojas. "He has been working very hard and he really looked good before in practice and everything, a little calmer, without a lot of moving parts, (then) it's not the same in the game." … It came out of the rhythm it had. "

  After starter Michael Wacha was marked by five runs in the first two innings, the Mets quickly found an opportunity to sneak in in the third, following consecutive walks by Brandon Nimmo and Jeff McNeil. Then, Alonso hit in a double play at the end of the inning.


  Alonso returned to the plate in fifth with Nimmo and McNeil coming on board, but fell short again, chasing a 3-2 shot by Luke Jackson out of the box for the first out. After a strikeout in the seventh inning, Alonso hit his bat on the bench multiple times.


  "It is definitely something that needs to regroup immediately," Rojas said of Alonso. "You have to prepare mentally and physically for (Sunday)."


  Although Alonso will be given the opportunity to overcome his difficulties, Céspedes no longer has the luxury of a long strap due to J.D.'s attractive replacement options. Davis and Dominic Smith.


  In addition to a couple of home runs, including the opening day game winner, a double and a pair of singles, the 34-year-old DH, plagued by injuries, looked like someone he hadn't played in two years.


  After Saturday's 0-for-4 effort with two strikeouts, leaving five men on base, Cespedes now has the team's worst batting average of .161 while hitting 1 of 13 on the road.


  With the Mets down 5-0 in the fourth inning, Michael Conforto and Robinson Cano opened the box with consecutive singles. Then came Cespedes, who struck out on three pitches. After Cano's sacrifice flight in the fifth, Cespedes ended a possible rally by landing two Mets on base.


  A week earlier, Cespedes said: "I will be that player again from then on."


  Now, it's unclear how long the former All-Star, in the final year of his contract, will have that opportunity.

That the “news” itself should be subordinated to such ideological constructs and misleading generalizations is distressing, to say the least. It hardly needs to be said that not every “Black” person is a noble victim, and not every “white” person is a sadistic brute…but, from now on, to make that point in the pages of most newspapers, or in most news broadcasts, will be tantamount to “hate speech”. Indeed, to speak of “Blacks” in any negative sense, or “whites” in any positive sense, might even become a _non sequitur_ , because, for leftist journalists, the English language has been effectively purged of the terminology one would use to express such (odious) ideas.
