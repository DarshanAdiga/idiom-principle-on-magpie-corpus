The editorial took some scathing digs at Sood and further also mentioned how he will soon be meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Raut launching his attack on BJP stated that Sood seems to be their publicity tool for the moment and that he may soon even become a celebrity manager for the party and promote it. It will be interesting to see if Sood responds to this scathing attack on him.

it’s not like she tweeted “I don’t think pineapple should be on pizza” Jon, she tweeted that trans women aren’t women. that’s not an “opinion” it’s transphobia and nobody should tolerate it

The idea that women like me, who’ve been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship because they’re vulnerable in the same way as women - ie, to male violence - ‘hate’ trans people because they think sex is real and has lived consequences - is a nonsense.

The tweet immediately went viral on social media. People are calling Rowling’s comment ‘anti-trans’ and ‘transphobic’ as they pointed out that transgender people, non-binary people and gender-nonconforming people can also menstruate. In the follow-up tweets, Rowling criticised the idea that someone’s biological sense is not real. She hinted that trans people are ‘erasing the concept of sex’ attempting to justify her stance by using it to support ‘same-sex attraction.’

GLAAD, an organisation for LGBTQ+ rights, stated that Rowling’s comments targeted trans people and the author aligned herself with an ideology which ‘distorted’ facts about gender identity and trans people.

People who menstruate.’ I’m sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?

Her tweets seemingly ignore the difference between gender and sex, a difference that is backed by science and the existence of intersex individuals, who are born with reproductive or sexual anatomy, but does not fit the typical definitions of the female and male sex. Rowling added that she respects trans people’s right to live comfortably, but struck out at people calling her a TERF—Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist.

If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth.

JK Rowling continues to align herself with an ideology which willfully distorts facts about gender identity and people who are trans. In 2020, there is no excuse for targeting trans people.

Her series of tweets have come amid the June Pride Month 2020 celebration, which is significantly celebrated in the United States and by LGBTQ+ community across the world. This is not the first time that Rowling has drawn criticism on social media on her opinions on gender and sex. According to reports, last year in December, she faced backlash while supporting author, Maya Forstater, who was fired from a think tank for saying that men could not change into women.
