With respect to the second point, the amendments by Calfrac to the original Management Transaction have confused the situation somewhat (which may have been Calfrac's intention). Calfrac now clearly states that it intends to "pivot" to a CCAA proceeding if they cannot obtain CBCA Court approval of the Amended Management Transaction. Moreover, coercively, and in a classic "carrot and stick" approach, they now propose to retract the modest enhancements they offered to the original Management Transaction in any CCAA proceeding.

Economist at UOB Group Barnabas Gan reviewed the latest measures by the Thailand government to support the economy. Key Quotes "As of 2Q20, the Thai Cabinet has approved a total of THB2.4 trillion (15% of GDP) of support measures to combat the negative effects of COVID-19. The measures included three stimulus tranches, including THB400 billion on 10th March, THB117 billion on 24th March, and THB1.9 trillion on 7th April." "Since then, more stimulus measures have been introduced to revitalise the tourism industry, encourage domestic consumption, improve the job market, and alleviate economic hardships especially for the low-income earners. Collectively, we estimate that around THB176 billion (1.1% of GDP) has been announced since the third stimulus tranche in April. This will bring Thailand's total fiscal COVID-19 response to 16.1% of GDP." "Despite the massive stimulus measures seen year-to-date, Thailand's economy remains in a recession. The Bank of Thailand in its latest Monetary Policy Meeting, pencilled a GDP contraction of 7.8% in 2020, up from a prior forecast of -8.1%. This compares to our full-year GDP outlook of -7.5%." "With monetary policy space running low given BOT's benchmark rate already at a record low of 0.5%, more fiscal stimulus measures may be on the cards. The Thai authorities will reportedly meet on 7 October 2020 to mull over more measures to shore up growth and encourage domestic consumption."

Si el Ejecutivo y el Gobierno Regional de Arequipa no liman asperezas y se ponen de acuerdo para destrabar Majes-Siguas II en los siguientes 44 días, la paralización de ese proyecto podría llevar a su vez a la postergación de inversiones por US$ 3,150 millones en Arequipa, vinculadas en forma directa a ese futuro complejo de irrigación. El Ministerio de Agricultura ha estimado que, de no haber acuerdo entre las partes en ese plazo y, en consecuencia, concretarse el anunciado retiro de Cobra como concesionario del proyecto, su reactivación se podría retrasar por tres años. Sin embargo, Gestión supo que, de resolverse el contrato de concesión, retomar la ejecución de Majes-Siguas II podría tomar no tres, sino hasta diez años, considerando las diversas etapas que se tendrán que dar, a partir de que se concrete la salida de la empresa concesionaria. En ese primer escenario, la empresa podría iniciar un proceso de trato directo –que tomaría cuando menos seis meses– para que el Estado le reconozca las inversiones realizadas en los últimos años en el proyecto, más el perjuicio económico que se le habría causado, y que, en conjunto, podría sumar hasta US$ 100 millones. Pero, de no haber acuerdo en un trato directo, el consiguiente proceso de arbitraje ante el Ciadi (para determinar si la empresa cumplió todos los procedimientos para llevar a cabo la caducidad del contrato) podría tomar en resolverse hasta tres años y medio. A continuación, el Estado tendría que convocar a una licitación para volver a adjudicar y entregar en concesión la continuación de las obras y futura operación del proyecto a un nuevo operador, lo cual podría tomar otros seis años. Es decir, diez en total. Eso significa que en ese periodo corre el riesgo de paralizarse no solo la inversión de US$ 650 millones que demandará toda la construcción de Majes-Siguas II, sino además de los proyectos de construcción de las centrales hidroeléctricas de Luz del Sur, vinculadas a la futura irrigación, por cerca de US$ 1,000 millones, y que ya habían sido aprobados por el Gobierno Regional de Arequipa. A ello se suman las inversiones estimadas en US$1,500 millones que, se calculó, demandará el preparar las 38,500 hectáreas de nuevas tierras de cultivo que pondría a disposición Majes-Siguas II. Es decir, se podrían paralizar un total de 3,150 millones que se preveían ejecutar con un 70% de componente local en los siguientes ocho años. Hasta el momento, Majes- Siguas II tiene un avance del 20% con 800 metros de túnel construido, una tuneladora paralizada y una inversión ya realizada por la empresa, estimada en US$ 70 millones. Se supo que una alternativa viable para evitar que el proyecto se paralice, sería que el Gobierno nacional otorgue la garantía que se requiere para financiar los US$ 104 millones necesarios para aplicar el cambio de tecnología que permita asegurar una mayor provisión de agua al proyecto, pero hasta ahora, el MEF no estaría de acuerdo con ello. El gerente de la Autoridad para el Desarrollo de Majes-Siguas II (Autodema, dependiente del Gobierno Regional de Arequipa), Napoleón Ocsa, señaló a gestion.pe que buscan sostener una reunión con el concesionario a cargo del proyecto para tomar una decisión final entre las partes, “en concordancia, y no por presión”. Por lo pronto, dijo que ya quedó descartado el pase de la titularidad de Majes-Siguas II al Minagri, y que en Autodema van a ir por el “plan B”, que es lograr que el Congreso apruebe el otorgamiento de la garantía soberana (por US$ 104 millones), para el cambio de tecnología para la irrigación del proyecto. Dijo que, si se aprueba antes del 30 de octubre, se podría prorrogar la fecha para la caducidad del contrato de concesión con Cobra.

The new Motormen boss has moved to bring in both Brad Bennett and Ayub Kadiri on dual registrations with Isthmian North side Tilbury, while also recruiting Jack Chawner on a dual registration from his former club Aveley.
 “We said when coming in we didn’t want to make wholesale changes and have to bring 10-plus new faces in,” added Christou, who succeeded Micky Wetherall.
 “Just a few lads have come in to help the core we had here and give us quality in depth. I think with games coming thick and fast you need quality within a squad, not just 11.
 “We’ve only had one proper training session as a squad before Friday so it’s really pleasing that the new boys have come in and gelled so quickly.”
 Redbridge are without a match this weekend having already been knocked out of the FA Cup, but they return to league action on Tuesday evening when they host West Essex.
 They will be determined to build on the start they’ve had under the new management team since taking over last week.
 “West Essex are a good side who have players who can hurt anyone in this league, so we need to be switched on from the get-go. Our boys have got some confidence back so we are looking forward to it,” said Christou.

Ironic because it has a picture at the ten-second mark of Biden standing behind a podium with a "BUY AMERICAN" sign on it.  This is ironic in light of what he has done for China in the recent past.  About Buy American: "In fact, when it comes to one of the most attention-getting provisions of the Biden plans -- greatly expanding the use of federal Buy American requirements to boost demand for manufactured goods, tightening enforcement, and narrowing or eliminating loopholes -- similar measures were _actively opposed_ [emphasis mine] by Obama during the worst of the Great Recession of 2007-09."  I guess Biden thinks the economy is strong enough now to implement what his boss opposed twelve years ago.  But wait!  Biden recently accused Trump of causing a depression.  Since a depression is worse than a recession, I guess Biden thinks it's OK to implement economic sanctions Obama opposed.  I find Biden's plans ironic and sad.

  In the ODI rankings, India (121) and England (119) have lost four points each, while clinging on to their second and third positions respectively.


  Six-time world champions and winners of both editions of the ICC Women's Championship, Australia's stellar display during the rating period saw them win 20 of 21 ODIs, increasing their tally by eight points to 160.


  Their massive lead of 39 points over second-placed India is the largest by any team (men or women) in any form of the game.


  It comes on the back of 3-0 series wins over India, Pakistan, New Zealand, England, West Indies, Sri Lanka and an earlier 2-1 victory over England in 2017.


  At the fourth spot is South Africa (107), who enjoy a 13-point lead over New Zealand (94), with the West Indies (85), Pakistan (77), Bangladesh (61) and Sri Lanka (47) following in that order.


  Three teams -- Denmark, Belgium and Qatar -- have lost their place on the rankings table. Denmark and Belgium have not played any matches since October 2017 while Qatar have played fewer than the required six during the period.


  The biggest improvement in rankings has been registered by Brazil, who are up 11 places to 27th, after a gain of 15 rating points, while the biggest ranking fall has been for Malaysia, who are down from 31st to 38th.


  The rankings which exclude results from the 2016-17 season, are based on the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons at 50 per cent and the 2019-20 matches at 100 per cent.

Chavez, who works for L.A. Unified, is one of 10 educators who were named a Los Angeles County teacher of the year on Thursday. Though most were nominated by their schools before the pandemic even hit, their outstanding skills have been put to task since March, when schools were shut down and they were forced to adapt to distance learning overnight.


  Their experiences illustrate how even the best are mightily challenged during this crisis in education.


  Across the board, the teachers said that maintaining a connection with students through a screen — though not impossible — has been their biggest hurdle.

NASCAR set aside all the old ways of doing business.


  “We said back in 2019 ... 2021, you were going to see some really bold changes from NASCAR,” said Steve O’Donnell, NASCAR’s executive vice president. “We believe we’ve delivered on that. We are excited for our fans, it’s an historic schedule, the most changes since 1969.”


  NASCAR will visit three new venues: Road America in rural Wisconsin, which will host the Cup Series for the first time since 1956; the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas; and Nashville Superspeedway, a visit that was previously announced.


  Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee will fill its 0.533-mile bullring with soil for the first Cup race on a dirt track since Richard Petty won at State Fairgrounds Speedway in Raleigh in 1970.


  Next year’s schedule was the first time NASCAR could make big changes since 2016, when it entered into unprecedented, five-year sanctioning agreements with race promoters. That meant no changes, even as fans begged for something new as the racing often settled into the monotonous.


  The best NASCAR could do was wait for the contracts to expire.


  Making the changes meant walking away from Chicagoland Speedway, owned by NASCAR and once a shining example of racing’s expansion into major markets a generation ago. The track in suburbn Joliet was nothing special and its land became more valuable than its spot on the Cup calendar.


  Also closed was Kentucky Speedway, the track that began its quest for a Cup race through a federal lawsuit filed against NASCAR. Michigan and Dover Raceway in Delaware will go from two Cup races a year to one.

  # COVID-19 case confirmed at Mount Markham Elementary


  Donna Thompson


  Times Telegram


  Mount Markham Elementary School students and staff will shift to remote instruction Friday after a positive COVID-19 case was reported in the school in West Winfield.


  Citing privacy laws, Superintendent Joe D’Apice said he could not discuss the identity of the individual or provide many details about the case other than to say the district is assisting Herkimer County Public Health with contact tracing. Either Public Health or the school district will contact families if it is determined that their child was in close proximity of the individual who tested positive, he said.


  “Closing the building tomorrow (Friday) will allow our custodians and cleaners to engage in a rigorous and comprehensive deep cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting regimen over the next 48 hours,” D’Apice said in a statement Thursday afternoon.


  He added the confirmed case only impacts a particular cohort of students at the elementary building. All non-quarantined elementary students may return to in-person instruction on Monday.


  The middle school and high school will remain open Friday and those students should report to school unless they were affected by the positive case. Anyone who does not receive a call from the school or Herkimer County Public Health may return to school as usual, as can all BOCES, VP TECH, and CTE students, according to D’Apice.


  D'Apice said the district received word Thursday afternoon from the parent of the individual who tested positive and the district contacted Herkimer County Public Health.


  The superintendent said the district was not told to close the building Friday, but added, "We wanted to err on the side of caution."


  The district contacted all of the families of students who were in the cohort affected prior to putting out an all-call regarding the situation.


  "We were able to give each student a device and a hot spot before they left," D'Apice said.


  The district was prepared for this, he said. "This was a good test of our procedures."


  Thursday’s announcement at Mount Markham was the third case in a Herkimer County school district.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — After two decades of the same left turns at the same tracks over and over again, NASCAR finally upended its stagnant calendar with a 2021 schedule that is as radical as the sport has ever seen.


  Three new venues. A dirt race for the first time in more than 50 years. And a whopping six road courses for the elite Cup Series in an overhaul unveiled Wednesday that dumped some of the cookie-cutter oval tracks right off the list.


  It is a true shakeup after a lack of imagination created the most predictable schedule in sports, one that favored new speedways — 1.5-mile ovals that not only all looked the same, but raced the same, too. Not since Indianapolis Motor Speedway was added in 1994 had a Cup race been awarded to a track that was not part of an ownership group for an active speedway.

Burgess said there was a one-week time frame to submit the ticket, but she missed an email about being a winner and by the time the office called her, she only had days to get the ticket post-marked.


  “That’s why you chose certified mail,” Burgess told the station. “With Covid, I understand the mail is a little bit slow. But for safety sake, certified mail usually has priority.”


  Lottery officials told WFLA the claim was never received at the headquarters.


  The claims department told Burgess to contact the postal service to find out what happened to the letter. The postal service said they are investigating what happened.


  In a statement to the station, the postal service offered an apology to Burgess for any “inconvenience.”


  If the package arrives, lottery officials told the station that they would bend the rules and pay Burgess the $1,000 if it was postmarked by the original deadline.


  “Ms. Burgess’ situation is an unusual circumstance and, to our knowledge, no other winner has experienced a similar issue,” the lottery said.

Before building a structure designed to last 100 years, Treyger and Jensen turned to the Danish Maritime Institute to find out how tall the tallest container ship would likely become. The answer — 203 feet from the waterline — established the first requirement for their bridge.


  They would give it a 205-foot clearance, 50 feet — or six stacked shipping containers — taller than the old bridge.


  They also wanted to situate the primary supports for the bridge — its two towers — 1,000 feet apart, almost five times greater than the width of the channel below. If the port wanted to expand that waterway, it could.


  With these dimensions, they settled upon building what is known as a cable- stayed bridge, which gave them three advantages.


  Unlike a suspension bridge — the Golden Gate, for example — a cable-stayed bridge does not require giant concrete anchors on the ground that support the two main cables slung over the top of the towers. The real estate on either side of the towers could be used for other purposes.


  The construction of a cable-stayed bridge does not require a temporary structure rising from the ground to support construction of the roadbed. That would impede traffic under the bridge, and the business of the port needed to continue without interruption.


  Lastly, the design would be elegant, “a postcard bridge,” Kenagy said.


  “The community had input in this planning,” he said, describing early public forums. “Residents indicated that they wanted a bridge that would accentuate the skyline of Long Beach.”

The coronavirus has battered the economy and cost many people their jobs, but for dozens of Los Angeles Fire Department employees assigned to COVID-19 test sites, the pandemic has delivered a bonanza in overtime pay.


  “There are guys making more in a month than a teacher makes in a year,” said an LAFD official who questioned the exorbitant payouts at a time when Mayor Eric Garcetti, who has taken bows for providing free COVID testing at several city locations, has told top city managers to prepare for possible layoffs and other cost cutting.


  “The numbers are shocking,” said the official, who reached out to me but requested anonymity. He directed me to city records showing that numerous LAFD personnel have repeatedly been credited with 10, 16 and even 24 hours a day of overtime since they started pulling COVID duty shifts, even though test sites are generally open only from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.


  Of course we all appreciate the heroic work of firefighters who routinely risk their lives, especially when half of California is in flames, and a lot of them aren’t pulling any COVID duty. Also, the payroll records don’t show whether all the overtime paid out to the firefighters the source named was for COVID work. But in my cruise through city payroll records, I found staggering payouts to LAFD personnel whose primary role when they work at testing sites is to open the facilities, close them, deliver results to a lab, replenish supplies and keep tabs on the equipment.

Most recently, scammers pretend to be from the IRS or other government agency. The scammer says that you owe money for taxes, bail money, debt collection and any other reason. To avoid arrest they will instruct you to pay them with gift cards.


  Another scam is when they try to convince you that a family member is in trouble. The scammer tells you that they need to be paid in gift cards in order to remedy the situation and may deter you from contacting the family member to verify the claim.


  Please DO NOT believe them, and never buy gift cards for them or provide them with any gift card codes. Federal, state and local agencies will not request gift cards for payment to resolve legal problems.


  Scammers are always changing the ways they trick people. If anyone asks you for a code, it could be a scam. Especially if they provide you directions on how to avoid suspicion from the checkout clerk! Never use gift cards to pay for fees or bills. Never share the code on the back of the gift card with anyone.

Manchester United (@ManUtd) October 2, 2020


  "I think the 11, 12, 13 players who really played and really played well deserved to play. When you don't play, you don't get the fitness or sharpness you need to knock on the door to get into the team.


  "It's a different scenario now after two games. I've seen a lot of the other players who didn't play too much last season performing very well."


  Indeed, Solskjaer added that "results" are "the only way to affect the mood in the club".


  But the United boss still hinted at a desire to see arrivals in the coming days, although he said his thinking was not impacted by big spending at Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Everton.


  "Of course, the transfer window is still open for a little while," Solskjaer said. "The club has been working and they know my view. We're here to strengthen it in the long term as well.


  "I'm not going to say what's acceptable for other clubs and teams in this difficult period. We'll tell you when and if something happens."


  Despite his defence of United's work, Solskjaer took no issue with former team-mates - including Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Neville and Darren Fletcher - criticising the club's failings in their new roles as pundits.


  "Patrice, Rio, Gary, Fletch have always been welcome here to talk to me instead, but they're doing their jobs," the manager said. "It's their jobs, so we can allow them to do their jobs.


  "We're all wanting Man United as high as possible. It's my job. That's what I'm working with."

Sofia Coppola should cast Bill Murray in all of her movies. There's something about her writing, his acting that clicks so marvelously. And while their latest collaboration, the father-daughter charmer "On the Rocks," is hardly in the same league with their Oscar-winning "Lost in Translation," it's no less an unexpected treat.
 Set mostly in Manhattan, "Rocks" is precariously constructed around the thinnest of premises: A suspicious wife, Rashida Jones' Laura, teaming with her suave, playboy dad, Felix (Murray), in a creaky attempt to prove her workaholic husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans), is cheating on her with a gorgeous office mate, Fiona (Jessica Henwick). That's it; hardly what you'd deem riveting.
 Yet what "Rocks" lacks in narrative heft is more than atoned for via a decisively romantic twist on a platonic father-daughter team knowing exactly how to push each other's buttons. Laugh-out-loud funny, it's not. Charming and knowing, yes! And the source of most of that endearment is Murray, turning the Murray pizzazz up to 11. He even revives a bit of his classic "SNL" lounge- singer bit, accompanied by Paul Schaffer, just like the old days. It's his chemistry with Jones, though, that ultimately gets "Rocks" off.
 It opens with a black screen with Murray on the soundtrack overheard telling a teenage Laura that until she marries, she belongs to him; and once she IS married ... she still belongs to him. Swoon, right? Yes, definitely. Cut to an adult Laura running off with Dean during their wedding reception for a little skinny dipping at the club's indoor pool. Clearly, they are hot for each other. Now, move ahead a half-dozen or so years. Laura, an author, is struggling with a twin case of writer's block and suspicions about Dean's extra-curricular activities. Their spontaneity has cooled considerably. Having two busy preteen daughters will do that to a marriage.
 Then comes the night Dean returns home from his latest business trip to London. It's after dark and Laura is asleep, but that doesn't stop Dean from climbing on top of her to deliver a passionate kiss. Then, bam, he backs off and falls asleep, as if he's just realized he's kissing his wife and not his sexy mistress. Laura freaks, tells her art-dealer dad, and Felix being Felix, jumps instantly into action, calling on his endless network connections to help them spy on Dean wherever he goes.
 OK, that part is every bit as rote as it sounds. Patience, my fellow movie buffs. Coppola is about to tap into her uncanny gift for penning mellifluous dialogue. As the not-so-deft father-daughter detectives stake out Dean's comings and goings, they engage in what at first seems like throwaway conversations. You know the kind, where the father and daughter toss cynical darts back and forth like they're having a catch. Luckily, it's riveting. There are about a half-dozen such scenes, which Coppola smartly allows to play out for extended periods. It's not only fun to watch them spar, but bask in the finely nuanced examination of what it is between fathers and daughters that enables them to call BS so easily on one another. And with Laura, there's plenty to rag on concerning her father, a relentless schmoozer who broke her mother's heart back in the day with his wandering eye.
 There's a particularly terrific scene late in the movie on a trip to Mexico, where they've tailed Dean. Talking over drinks, the subject turns to Felix's mistress, Holly. Laura flat asks, "Why did you do it"? With Coppola's camera fixed tight, Murray displays his magnificence by letting his face tell you everything you need to know about how deeply Felix feels the hurt after realizing how profoundly his selfish trysts have disappointed Laura. It's really something, too.
 And Coppola knows it, wisely building her entire scenario around the study of what makes Felix tick, from his shameless flirting, to his easiness with his two granddaughters, to his disarming manner; the latter coming in handy when talking a New York cop out of issuing him a speeding ticket. Jones, who doesn't always get her due as an actress, proves a compelling brawling partner for Murray, tantalizingly making you wonder how much better or worse she would have been had she gotten the Scarlett Johansson part in "Lost in Translation," a role she was originally considered.
 Oh, and while you're at it, keep an eye out for Milton native Jenny Slate in a wasted part as Laura's lovelorn singleton best friend, and Barbara Bain as Felix's disapproving mother. But make no mistake; this is Murray's showcase through and through. And with an able assist from Jones, he joyously lives up to fulfilling his place as Coppola's extraordinary muse.

EAST TEXAS (KLTV/KTRE) - The Texas crop and weather report says peanut harvest is underway, and producers are expecting lower per-acre yields than last season. Peanut harvest should ramp up over the next few weeks and wrap up toward the end of October, according to a Texas A&amp;M Agrilife extension service expert. Here in East Texas, rain from the recent tropical storm swept through the region and some areas received as much as 7 inches. Sabine county reported bottomlands were too wet for hay harvesting, but many upland areas were well drained and being cut. Panola County reported producers were looking forward to a late October hay cutting for an already above- average production season. Pasture and rangeland conditions were listed as good and subsoil and topsoil conditions were listed as adequate. The report says fly numbers were still high and producers continue monitoring for armyworms.To stay up to date with all the local Ag News. Click over to ETXAgNews.com.Copyright 2020 KLTV/KTRE.

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.


  Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.


  In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

The Motormen gave Christou a winning start with a 2-0 victory away at local rivals Woodford Town on Friday evening. A goal in each half from Craig Hall and Terry Amoafu was enough to secure the points although it could have been many more with the Motormen missing a series of good chances. On Tuesday evening, a Craig Hall hat-trick, along with a Abdishakur Farah goal, secured a 4-0 victory over Enfield at the Oakside Stadium in the former Aveley Reserves manager's first home match in charge. "I'm really pleased with both performances. We had a game plan and the boys stuck to it and we got rewards from it," Christou said. "Our striker Craig Hall is scoring goals and we are keeping clean sheets so it's a very good start but we know there is room for improvement." The new Motormen boss has moved to bring in both Brad Bennett and Ayub Kadiri on dual registrations with Isthmian North side Tilbury, while also recruiting Jack Chawner on a dual registration from his former club Aveley. "We said when coming in we didn't want to make wholesale changes and have to bring 10-plus new faces in," added Christou, who succeeded Micky Wetherall. "Just a few lads have come in to help the core we had here and give us quality in depth. I think with games coming thick and fast you need quality within a squad, not just 11. "We've only had one proper training session as a squad before Friday so it's really pleasing that the new boys have come in and gelled so quickly." Redbridge are without a match this weekend having already been knocked out of the FA Cup, but they return to league action on Tuesday evening when they host West Essex. They will be determined to build on the start they've had under the new management team since taking over last week. "West Essex are a good side who have players who can hurt anyone in this league, so we need to be switched on from the get-go. Our boys have got some confidence back so we are looking forward to it," said Christou.

SWANTON — Kevin Priest’s love for the game of baseball began in East Hampton, Massachusetts.
 “When I was four or five years old, I lived in a veteran’s project, and right next to us was a field, and a farmer let the parents build a baseball field on it,” said Priest.
 “I grew up playing with the neighborhood kids, and when school was out, we’d invite kids from other parts of the town to play with us.”
 Priest got his first taste of the Big Leagues in 1953 when his cousin brought him to see the Red Sox play at Fenway Park.
 “In the 50s, I grew up watching the Yankees on CBS TV in Western Massachusetts,” said Priest.
 “The Yankees were on TV Saturday and Sunday. I’d come home and watch the Yankees after church on Sunday afternoon.”
 In 1961, the year Roger Maris hit his 61st home run, Priest, a good friend, and his friend’s family took the train from Springfield, MA, to watch a game at Yankee Stadium.
 “It was a doubleheader against Detroit. Frank Lary was one of the pitchers that beat the Yankees,” said Priest.
 “Maris had a home run in both games, and Mickey Mantle, Johnny Blanchard, and Clete Boyer all had home runs for the Yankees runs. That was a strong Yankees team.”
 Priest remained a faithful Yankees fan until 1964 when the organization fired Yogi Berra.
 “If the Yankees were going to do that to Yogi, I wasn’t going to be a Yankees fan. I still appreciate the Yankees,” said Priest.
 In that same year, Red Sox games were televised in his hometown, it was also Carl Yastrzemski’s rookie year, and t was the year Priest decided to be a Red Sox fan.
 Priest’s early love for baseball translated, and since that first foray into a major league park, Priest has been to many games.
 “I’ve been to four or five Major League games a year ever since, and I go to spring training for two weeks every spring,” said Priest.
 Priest went on to play ball in high school and in college; after college, he played in men’s league teams.
 The years he was in the service, 1967 to 1969, were the only two years Priest hasn’t played baseball since he was four years old.
 In 1974, Priest and his family moved to Swanton, where he was quickly tied into the athletic scene through Jack Eldridge and the Swanton Recreation board.
 In 1975, Priest began coaching Little League Baseball. During his tenure with Swanton Little League, Priest coached his son Kevin and had the opportunity to work with Bert Berthiaume, Richard Raliegh, Bob Raliegh, and Rich McVicker.
 “Kevin was on the mound when we won our first Little League championship in 1978,” said Priest.
 He also coached Matt Raliegh, who’d later go on to be an integral part of the legendary MVU three-peat state championship teams.
 “It was incredible to watch Matt go up through and see who he turned into as a player,” said Priest.
 “As a nine-year-old, Matt was probably one of the best pitchers in the league at the time, and he could always hit. You couldn’t throw a fastball by him. He was a smart player.”
 After four years with the young fellows, Priest took on a Babe Ruth team with Rich McVicker as his ‘sidekick.’
 “He was with me until Jay Hartman got hold of him and kept him,” said Priest, chuckling. “Rich is a great friend.”
 In Babe Ruth, Priest and McVicker coached the Royals while Richard Raleigh coached the Expos. Priest has been coaching Babe Ruth since 1978. In 1983, while coaching Babe Ruth, he also established a summer softball team where he coached his daughter Kim and Kerrie.
 “These guys were always playing Wiffle ball or shooting hoops. They didn’t stop after the game,” said Priest.
 Coaching has been a passion of Priest’s for decades.
 “I see the youngster that doesn’t have the skill but has the desire,” said Priest.
 “It doesn’t matter how big or small you are. If you have the spunk inside you and want to play, there’s a place for you in baseball.”
 When it comes to sports, baseball is Priest’s longtime favorite.
 “I love soccer and basketball, but baseball is the hardest game there is. There are nine guys out there trying to get you out, and you’re not going to be successful most of the time,” said Priest.
 “It’s the mental part of the game that turns kids off. They don’t want to face losing or making a mistake. It’s the coach’s job to let kids know that they are needed.”
 Regardless of ability, the mental game is in play on the diamond.
 “The mental part of the super athlete’s game is always in play, too. You can’t let him get too high or too low,” said Priest.
 “I like working with the different dimensions of a player’s personality, and you see it at all levels of the game.”
 Priest’s passion for the game has remained with him, whether he’s coaching or playing.
 “I’ve been fortunate to be healthy through high school, college, and right up until today,” said Priest.
 “I’ve always been able to hit the ball, I’ve got a good eye, and I’ll walk. I led our men’s league in walks and hit by pitches until Todd Beauregard beat me a few years ago.”
 Priest’s Swanton men’s league team competes in an over 40 league that plays by baseball rules with a catcher, leads, and stealing.
 After playing men’s league softball, Priest joined men’s league senior baseball in 1992. Since 2012 he’s played Men’s Senior Baseball League in Phoenix, AZ, and Roy Hobbs World Series in Fort Myers, FL (men’s league ages 65 and 70 years old and from New England.)
 When asked about some of the great men’s league players he’s shared the field with, it was Steve Martell who came to Priest’s mind first.
 “Steve is the most competitive and best all-around person I’ve ever played with. He could get a single anytime he wanted,” said Priest.
 “Dave Parady, who plays for us now, is a left-handed pitcher with a good pickoff move.
 “Todd Beauregard can catch and pitch and play the outfield. He’s our perennial MVP for the last few years, and he talks to everyone when he’s in the batter’s box.”
 Priest also noted the prowess of Jim Daly who even hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher, Bill Lee; he spoke of Gary Lawton, who could always get a hit up the middle.
 Priest has been leading baseball teams since he was a kid, serving as the athlete coach of his 7-10 and 10-12 Little League teams. Priest was also selected as the player-coach in Legion, and in his freshman year at Johnson State College.
 “We used to be the ones calling everyone up and coaching ourselves. I’m still doing that today,” said Priest, smiling.
 “I find it hard to stay away from the game. My wife’s still waiting for me to get older so we can spend some time together.”

BOSTON -- Senate President Karen Spilka told local officials in her district this week that action on the overdue annual state budget is unlikely to happen in the Legislature until after the presidential election, a softer target than the more ambitious goal articulated earlier in the week by the Senate's budget chief of making decisions on how to spend billions in tax dollars by the end of October.
 Spilka also said that Gov. Charlie Baker may file an updated version of the pre-pandemic fiscal 2021 spending plan he put forward in January, which would become the jumping off point for the House and Senate to craft their own budgets for the fiscal year that began on July 1.
 "Currently the state budget has been delayed, as you know," said Spilka, D-Ashland, appearing before the Holliston Board of Selectmen and the town Finance Committee on Tuesday night. "We are waiting on certain factors."
 "We will also know more after the election. If the feds have not done anything with a stimulus package, a second one, before that, we'll have a better idea as to how to interpret that with the election," Spilka said, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by the News Service.
 The comments made by the Senate's top Democrat add to the uncertainty of how Beacon Hill intends to proceed in the development of an annual state budget as legislators continue to wait for any clear signs from Congress about the prospects for additional federal aid.
 On Monday, Senate Ways and Means Chairman Michael Rodrigues said his goal was to have a budget passed and on Gov. Baker's desk by the end of this month when a three-month, $16.5 billion interim budget expires.
 "Our idea is to get it done by the end of October. I'm here today. I'm here every day. We are working," Rodrigues said from the State House.
 Rodrigues told the News Service on Thursday that he didn't mean to imply it had to happen by the end of the month, and that his goal is to finish the fiscal 2021 budget and turn his attention to the fiscal 2022 budget "as soon as possible." He acknowledged that was different from what he said three days earlier, and said he could have been more careful in choosing his words.
 After learning of the News Service's reporting, Spilka reached out to say she felt her comments were not incompatible with what Rodrigues has been saying, and that everything from the timeline for budget to the amount of money lawmakers will have to spend remains uncertain.
 "We would all love to get the budget done and focus on FY22. But our need is to do it right. We need more clarity," she said, pointing to renewed talks in Washington over relief spending. "This week alone it's changed at least three time what they're doing or not doing."
 A rare post-election budget debate would mean that scores of major decisions about spending would be made in part by a lame-duck Legislature featuring some lawmakers who are retiring and others who won't be returning in January because they lost their elections.
 Spilka told Holliston officials another interim budget is "very possible," and suggested the Legislature was inclined to wait a little longer to see if Congress will deliver another stimulus package with aid for states and municipalities.
 "There are people saying we can hold out for months. I'm not so certain. Eventually, we are going to need to do a full-year budget," Spilka said. "We need to have a balanced budget and we need to get it done, I would say hopefully before this year is out, this calendar year."
 Spilka went before the board with state Rep. Carolyn Dykema, D-Holliston, to update the town on the status of the state budget as local officials try to plan their own finances for the year.
 Next Wednesday, the Ways and Means committees have invited economists and other fiscal experts to offer updated projections for tax revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year. The hearing falls about a week before the annual Oct. 15 deadline for the administration to make adjustments to annual revenue projections that were agreed to by the administration and the Legislature in January.
 "The administration is required to certify revenues by Oct. 15 and they may be filing another budget, a revised budget from what they did last January. We're not certain," Spilka said.
 A spokesman for Administration and Finance Secretary Michael Heffernan would not say whether Baker intended to file another budget, only that the administration was working with legislative leaders. But officials in both the House, Senate and administration told the News Service that a new budget from Baker is on the table as an option, and that votes in the Legislature were unlikely until after Nov. 3.
 Holliston officials were particularly concerned that Beacon Hill's promise to level-fund unrestricted local aid and Chapter 70 school aid, with a $107 million boost for inflation, might get broken if Congress doesn't come through with additional relief.
 Spilka assured them that would not happen.
 "We have given our commitment. The Senate, the House and the governor. You don't get much better than that in this business," Spilka said.
 Spilka said the $3.4 trillion Heroes Act passed by the House would mean $10 billion for Massachusetts, but the latest talks have revolved around a significantly smaller package of aid.
 Asked about taxes if the federal government doesn't come through, Spilka said there are "other ways and other ideas."
 "We have options, but we don't want to start going down the path of one option if we're going to end up getting a decent amount in the federal stimulus," she said.
 In addition to the $3.5 billion "rainy day" fund, Spilka said legislators could employ an accelerated sales tax collection schedule that has been discussed for years, and would offer a one-time shift of hundreds of millions in sales taxes from one fiscal year to another.

Using federal coronavirus relief funds that were disbursed by Travis County, Bee Cave has launched a small business grant program.


   


  Through the CARES Act, federal funds were distributed to certain cities and counties with populations over 1 million residents. Based on its population, excluding Austin, Travis County received over $61 million. Austin was not included in the calculation because it received more than $170 million directly.


   


  However, smaller cities in the county, including Bee Cave, Lakeway and West Lake Hills, were not eligible for individual funding based on their populations but have felt the economic downturn of the pandemic.


   


  The city approved a contract with the county, which was one of the requirements to receive funding, Tuesday allowing it use a portion of its funds toward a small business assistance grant program.


   


  In May,16 mayors of small cities petitioned the Commissioners Court for a share of more than $26 million of the county's $61 million cut from the CARES Act to help their struggling economies.


   


  Every city within the county (except Austin) was eligible to apply for funds, county officials said.


   


  The Commissioners Court on June 2 approved a basic structure of $55 per person based on population, which is similar to state guidelines. Bee Cave was allocated just over $372,000.


   


  Assistant City Manager Lindsey Oskoui said the city's grant program is structured similarly to one the city's economic development board had but is relaxed in some of the requirements needed for funding.


   


  "We did relax a few of the requirements that were stumbling blocks for some businesses," she said, "mainly having to pay sales tax and the shortening the length of time the business would have been in operation."


   


  To qualify, Oskoui said, the business would have to demonstrate a 25% loss in revenue for the first two quarters of 2020.


   


  Businesses can receive up to $15,000 in funding from the city. At $15,000 a piece, city officials said up to 24 grants are up for grabs. The deadline to apply for a grant is Oct. 7. Funds are expected to be issued Oct. 26.


   


  As of Tuesday, the city had received two applications, but neither had qualified. Oskoui said if the city does not receive applications for the program, the city plans to use the funding to offset costs it incurred for coronavirus-related expenses such as teleworking and purchasing videoconferencing system Zoom.

The governor’s declaration that the sale in California of new fossil fuel powered vehicles would end in 15 years has been met with much fear and loathing including much ideologically motivated misunderstanding. Much of that is coming from sectors that depend on the economic support of fossil fuel extraction, production and distribution, and those who take comfort in the notions and practices of the past. But now the chickens have come home to roost and, indeed, roost with a vengeance.
 In the progress of civilization from the advent of steam power in the 1830s to the introduction of the private automobile in the 1880s all were met with resistance. Then arguments included notions that speed would cause nosebleeds to various emerging technologies weren’t “Scriptural.” This even included the development of radio and the telephone, the latter faced resistance from some like today’s technophobes who refuse to use cell phones or computers.
 What many have failed to notice is the direction leading manufacturers in the auto industry itself is now taking. For the last 10 years the industry has been preparing a transition from fossil fueled vehicles to electric, including hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles. Volvo Cars, as one example, has committed to putting one million electrified cars on the road by 2025. Tesla, a rare newcomer to the automobile industry, has long been a leading producer of high quality, highly desirable electric vehicles. Battery technology itself is improving on a daily basis. Infrastructure for facilitating public charging is increasing and building codes now require installation of a electric vehicle charging junction box in new residential construction.
 Ideological notions aside, this speaks to the future of private transportation and the inevitable transition away from dependence on sources of carbon pollution. This matter is one that must be addressed in the realm of science, not ideology, politics and fear.
 In addressing science, we should not give credence to that tiny handful of scientists who have tossed their professional integrity for a payday from such ideological lobbyists as the so-called Heartlands Institute, who insult their credentials by affirming the notions of those who deny the facts of climate science.
 We now face new and different economic challenges. Evidence provided by sound research from our leading scientific institutions, including NASA and NOAA, demonstrate a clear connection between atmospheric carbon buildup, a warming Earth and its long predicted increasingly violent weather. Denial of our changing climate and its causes is, as Dan Rather put it, “willful ignorance.” Such denial and claims that climate change, its causes and effects, are a hoax insults the professional integrity of our leading scientific institutions.
 With major oil producing regions in the world, including Kern County, the desire to protect the status quo is compelling. No one likes disruption. Yet, the need to take the next step in progress is also compelling.
 Like jobs in the oil patch, sustainable carbon free energy won’t happen without employees. When it comes to facing the realities of the effects of carbon based energy, in making such changes, we can either be leaders running ahead of the curve or be dragged kicking and screaming behind the curve pretending that change and the need for change isn’t happening. The choice is ours. The results are real.

  “This whole situation has definitely made me think outside the box and really be creative,” Dent said. “This is not what we want to be doing, but the kids still deserve the best possible education I can give them.”


  One of the most rewarding moments for Chavez was when, ahead of a three-day weekend, a student asked if he could log onto Zoom on Monday and say hi to the class, anyway.


  “Through all the challenges and the sleepless nights and wondering when we’ll get back, just that comment right there made me realize I’m doing a good job,” she said. “The kids want to be there.”

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.


  Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.


  Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

En este sentido, mencionó distintos obstáculos y dificultades para ubicar la producción automotriz en el país hermano. Según sostuvo, hay restricciones administrativas que en cierta medida se deben a las dificultades de divisas que tiene Argentina. «Son barreras no arancelarias pero que complican porque si hay una industria que necesita trabajar justo a tiempo, es la industria automotriz, es una línea de ensamblaje de procesos que requieren que los insumos le lleguen cuanto antes y esto se empezó a complicar estos últimos meses».

"As an actor, you go on so many auditions, but it was one of those things where you're just like, 'Oh God, it would be so awesome to get this.' But then I read the scene and it was one of those -- and I've only had this happen a couple of times, maybe with Gretchen Wieners -- where I read the scene and it was almost I was memorized already," Park says. "I felt so genuinely in tune with the thought process of the character. I'm never like, 'Oh, this one's my part. I'm going to get this part. I'm going to do that.' But I remember after auditioning going off to do this play and I talked to my mom on the phone and was like, 'I think I'm going to be moving to Paris.'"

Calfrac has failed to protect its Shareholders. Calfrac agreed to a transaction with its chairman and a self-selected group of unsecured creditors that would transfer tremendous shareholder value to those parties, and see Shareholders left in the cold. Only after Wilks decided that enough was enough, and made the Premium Offer, did Calfrac respond. And their response has failed. The Premium Offer provides $0.18 in cash per Calfrac share, a significant premium to market and to the $0.12 of likely consideration offered under the Amended Management Transaction.
