After the fall, there was no penalty but there was a face off. The East Ridge center won the face off and sent the puck to Claughtery.
 She slapped the puck towards the net and the goalie saved it. After that shot, she knew something was wrong with her shoulder as tears started to form under her helmet.
 Claughtery stayed out there for the next face off with the puck coming to her once again. She took another slap shot towards the net and after that shot, she was done. Claughtery knew it was something more than just a nagging injury.
 “After the second shot, I remember her coming off the ice and saying, ‘something is moving,’” McClintick said. “Once she said that, I said you’re done and she sat for the rest of the game. Then, you see her standing there with a bag of ice on her shoulder and your heart breaks for her.”
 After the game finished, Claughtery and her parents went to the emergency room and had X-rays done on her shoulder. Claughtery said the first diagnosis was that the collarbone was partially broken.
 About three days after the first X-ray, Claughtery said the new results showed the collarbone was completely displaced and she was required to have surgery.
 “We scheduled the surgery three days later and I came in with pneumonia, and they said they couldn’t do the surgery,” Claughtery said. “Everything was going downhill, so I finally got the surgery done two weeks later.”
 After the surgery, it was an odd feeling for Claughtery because she couldn’t do the little things she enjoyed like puck shooting or ice skating or many of the hockey activities.
 For McClintick, this was her first year as the East Ridge head coach and she was still getting to know the players. She wanted to give Claughtery her space after the surgery, but she also wanted her to know that she was there for anything she needed. It was tough for McClintick to go through because she never wanted to see one of her players go through an injury like.
 “It was strange because when I was watching the games, I realized how much it meant to me,” Claughtery said. “I actually realized how much I love this sport.”
 ## Uncommon healing leads to quick turnaround
 Once Claughtery had surgery, McClintick thought she was done for the year since the season only had a couple more months left. Claughtery had other plans.
 When she started physical therapy, she could already put her arm above her head and do stretches that the therapist wasn’t expecting. By the second session, Claughtery was using her stick and gloves which wasn’t supposed to happen for another two or three weeks.
 “The physical therapist was shocked to see that I could do everything at the beginning and they had to change plans because of my improvements,” Claughtery said. “They told me that this never happens. It should’ve taken two to three months to fully heal and it took me two to three weeks.”
 McClintick said she was shocked to see her cleared for practice only two to three weeks after her first physical therapy session, but she was excited to have her back for the postseason.
 The Raptors knew they could make a strong run to the state tournament and they wanted all of their players ready to go for sections and state. Claughtery came back with a couple games left in the regular season and helped East Ridge win the section title and advance to the state tournament.
 She shined in the state tournament with some strong performances and that confidence carried into the 2019-20 season. She became the leader and captain during her senior year and she’s shown it both on and off the ice.
 “She’s a perfect leader for this team because she’s taking these younger girls under her wing,” McClintick said. “It’s great to watch and I’m so proud of what she’s accomplished on the ice and off it too.”

Although women have traditionally not led Orthodox services, “partnership minyans” have begun to take root in Israel and the U.S. These services allow women to participate within the limits of Orthodox religious law, leading parts of prayer services or reading from the Torah. Brander said mainstream Orthodoxy is in the “embryonic stages" of embracing female theologians.

Numerous city office holders took their oaths, with New Haven Mayor Steve McMichael also in attendance. McMichael was sworn in the day before with more than 100 people in attendance at the New Haven Community Center. In addition, New Haven’s new clerk/treasurer Natalie Strock and the members of the city’s City Council also received the oath of office.
 Lana Keesling, city clerk of the city of Fort Wayne, administered the oath to McMichael, who is New Haven’s seventh mayor. Outgoing Mayor Terry McDonald welcomed the crowd and announced that “my level of stress has gone down dramatically the past couple days.” He assured the audience that the city is in good hands and that a lot of good things are on the horizon. “Steve is more than ready and has been working tirelessly since the election at City Hall and he’s a lot more prepared than I was when I became mayor 20 years ago. The transition has gone very smoothly.” He closed his remarks by saying “it is a tremendous honor to be Steve’s friend. God Bless New Haven.”
 McMichael told the gathering that he’s going to work very, very hard to make the community an even better place than it already is. “Great things are ahead for us,” he added.
 In an interview after the ceremony he said “we’ve got a million things going. A lot of initiatives are in the works and residents can keep abreast of what’s happening on our Facebook site (@NewHavenIn).” On a personal note, he said he will be stepping back from the day-to-day operation of his real estate firm, Imagine Real Estate. In fact, he said he has hired a manager to run the company.

The stock currently trades on a P/E ratio of 11 and offers a dividend yield of 4.8%. While dividend growth and a return to a higher share price seem unlikely in the short run, the company has a strong position across a number of markets. Its margin of safety and the prospect of a revised strategy could lead to improved performance that boosts market sentiment and delivers a higher level of return for investors over the long run.

Claughtery has helped this young Raptors team stay at a .500 record this season including some big conference wins against teams like Forest Lake. She’s also put on a spectacle individually, being one of the top goal scorers in the state.
 As of Jan. 5, Claughtery has scored 26 goals, putting her tied for third in the state. She’s tied for being the top goal scorer in Class AA as the other two girls are playing in Class A.
 For her, the secret is simple.
 “I keep my eyes up and I’m looking everywhere,” Claughtery said. “If I see a good shot, I’ll take it. Otherwise, I’ll find my teammates for better shots. My teammates are the reason why I’ve reached that many goals this season, so it definitely takes a team to reach this achievement.”
 Her focus is centered on making a strong run to end the regular season and try to get back to the state tournament. She knows this team is capable of many good things and they just need to keep working at each aspect in practice.
 After the season is over, Claughtery needs to make a decision on her future. She hasn’t committed to a college yet because she wasn’t sure if hockey was something she wanted to do in the future.
 After this injury, Claughtery said she’s soaking in each moment she can. McClintick has helped her with providing her feedback and past experiences of college hockey so she can make a good choice for her when the time comes. As for area of study, she enjoys chemistry and thinks something in the medical field.
 “I know she’s going to do great things when she graduates from East Ridge and I can’t wait to watch her journey,” McClintick said. “She’s not only a great hockey player with a strong IQ and skills, but she’s also a great person and that’s going to take her far.”
 Claughtery said she’ll take many fun memories with her from the five years on varsity, but her favorite moment will be during her sophomore year as a Raptor. East Ridge played at Stillwater on December 9, 2017, and the Raptors were down 3-2 in the third period. In the last couple of minutes, Claughtery took a shot at the goal and connected to tie the game at 3-3 and send it to overtime.
 About five minutes into overtime, Claughtery had another good shot at the net and took it. It went past the goalie and East Ridge won the game 4-3. The win meant a lot to her because it was a win against a team she grew up playing with and a rivalry she holds close to her heart.
 “This sport has taught me so much and during my time at East Ridge, I’ve started to love this sport more and more,” Claughtery said. “I just want to finish my senior year strong and do the best I can because this program did so much for me.”

She was the leading scorer by 19 goals — one of her peaks in her varsity career.
 “I think my big year came in my sophomore year because I went from nine goals as a freshman to over 30 goals as a sophomore,” Claughtery said. “I continued to learn more about the sport during that season and I think it built me into a leader as an upperclassman.”
 ## One heartbreaking hit
 Claughtery started off her junior year strong even though most eyes were focused on the large senior class for the Raptors during the 2018-19 season. Then, she faced the lowest low of her career on Dec. 8, 2018.
 East Ridge hosted Stillwater, but for Claughtery it meant so much more. For her, the Ponies were her rival and she wanted to win that one more than any other game in the season.
 The game started off well for her as she scored a goal in the first period and recorded an assist in the second. That strong start vanished in the middle of the game.
 Claughtery stole a puck from the Ponies and broke away for what looked to be a goal opportunity. When she got closer to the Stillwater goalie, she brought her stick back to hit a slap shot.
 In the midst of her shooting, she was knocked to the ice by a Stillwater defender. When Claughtery hit the ice, she landed awkwardly on her shoulder.
 “I knew something was wrong, but I was too scared to think something actually was wrong,” Claughtery said.

In 2019, while serving as chairman of Business Roundtable (BRT), an association of America’s leading companies with $7 trillion in annual revenues and 15 million employees, Dimon and the BRT issued a statement that redefined the purpose of a corporation as to promote “an economy that serves all Americans.”
 The statement, which goes well beyond the previous corporate focus of maximizing profits and share prices, includes compensating employees fairly, dealing ethically with suppliers, supporting communities, and protecting the environment. It was signed by 181 chief executives of America’s largest corporations.
 The best run companies do more than work to generate profits and return value to shareholders, said Tricia Griffith, president and CEO of Progressive Corporation. “They put the customer first and invest in their employees and communities.” Let’s hope all American companies heed her advice, which in the long run will benefit all parties — even the companies themselves through improved performance.
