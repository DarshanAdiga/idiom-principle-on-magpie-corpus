Vortex generators, added to the forward or main wings, may provide some benefit if installed correctly. A Davenport-type coil spring shimmy damper on the nose gear is much preferred over the plans version damper, according to Terry Schubert. Not all Long-EZs have a boarding step to assist in climbing over the side, which would seem worthwhile. An electrically powered nose gear extension system, versus the standard manual crank, adds some weight, which is always the enemy of structural safety and performance. Most, but not all, Long-EZs will have a cabin heating system of some sort (exhaust muff, oil radiator, electric socks), depending on their region of origin.

"They are in the 10-15 range so we certainly are watching to see what happens," Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said Tuesday. "I think it's not by accident that if you look in the last week where are we seeing in Chicago some of our highest percent positivity, some of our highest cases, they're down in the zip codes that border Indiana, where we know that right over the border percent positivity is much much higher, number of cases per population is much higher. It's a risk, but we chose that cutoff for a reason and people will go on and off that list when or if they either hit or come off that cutoff."

This is reflected by the World Bank’s Doing Business 2020 report where Ecuador received an extremely low rating, ranked 129 out of 190 countries, indicating that it remains a risky jurisdiction for foreign energy companies. It is Ecuador’s high levels of state interventionism that were identified as a key hazard.

Canopy latching is critical; there should be a warning system to alert you to an unlatched canopy before takeoff.
