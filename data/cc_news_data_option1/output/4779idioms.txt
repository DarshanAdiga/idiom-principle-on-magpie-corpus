In Valhalla, you’ll be playing as Eivor - who canonically fits in as either gender you pick, or you can allow ‘the Animus’ to change their gender depending on your choices as you play and the events you encounter. You and your adoptive elder brother Sigurd set out from the fjords of Norway to start life anew in England, your hearts set on raiding the four kingdoms and establishing a Norse settlement with your clan. Along for the ride are a pair of assassins (‘Hidden Ones’ really, the precursors to the legendary brotherhood we know and love), whose interests align with your own: they are seeking to take down the Order of the Ancients (also precursors to the Templars) in England, and considering the Order tend to mingle around those in power, your targets are the same. This sets the stage for a grand saga, sending you to each kingdom to usurp the power of the Order while turning your settlement into a thriving hub for your clan.

The Carencro Bears held off Westgate 31-23 Thursday night in a matchup of two of the top teams in what is probably the toughest Class 4A district in the state.
 While his team wanted to win, there were still a lot of positives for the Tigers, who finish the regular season 5-3 overall and 2-2 in district. WHS looks to have wrapped up a first-round playoff game at home for the second straight year. According to the unofficial power rankings at GeauxPreps.com, Westgate will be the No. 15 seed in Class 4A with the top 16 teams at home in the first round.
 On Thursday, the Tigers left a lot of points on the field, Antoine said.
 “I think we let the game get away,” he said. “We were outmatched size wise and strength wise, but our guys held up and played hard.”
 A safety resulted from a blocked punt, but Antoine said the Tigers had a chance to fall on the ball for a touchdown and didn’t. Westgate was penalized for hitting a defenseless player on their first drive into the red zone. In the second half, Westgate scored to take the lead and went for an onside kick but didn’t recover, and Carencro scored on the next play, Antoine said. Giving up a couple of big plays he felt the Tigers shouldn’t have hurt, but overall Antoine was pleased with the effort.
 “We played hard,” Antoine said. “We played with a lot of effort.”
 Sophomore Dedrick Latulas played well, the coach said. Dylan Bourque is doing a good job kicking, one of the issues the coaches were concerned about early that seems to be settled. Defensive linemen Bradley Lewis and Daniel Herron also played well, Antoine said.
 “Guys are playing well,” he said. “We’re in the playoffs now. Everything matters and everything counts.”
 Playing a good team like Carencro (7-1, 3-1) doesn’t leave room for mistakes, though. The Bears look to enter the playoffs as the No. 2 seed in 4A.
 “Playing a good team like that, you have to take advantage of those opportunities, and I felt like we had our chances to win it and we didn’t,” Antoine said.
 WHS lost quarterback Brennan Landry in the first half, with Danny Lewis stepping in to that role. Lewis had a couple of timing issues with his receivers from not having thrown to them a lot in practice, but played well given the circumstances, Antoine said.
 “Those are some of the things that we’ll clean up and we’ll be ready to go whenever we play next week,” he said.
 Landry is waiting on an MRI, and Antoine said the Westgate trainers feel it will be a day-to-day on whether he can play and probably will be a gametime decision. Lewis and Ja’Quailen Allen will get the reps all week as the Tigers will prepare for the game as if Landry won’t be available, the coach said.
 “We’re going to prepare for him not to be there, and if he’s there, that’s a bonus,” Antoine said.
 Antoine said the Tigers will be ready for whoever the playoff opponent will be.
 “More than likely, the way it’s looking right we should have a home game, and whoever we play is who we’re going to play,” he said. “I don’t know what the situation is going to be with the COVID, but I’m pleased with the year we had with our guys. They played their tails off. We battled some injuries early and kind of got over the bug.”
 Westgate played a couple of 5A teams and is in a district featuring Carencro, likely Division II No. 2 seed St. Thomas More (7-0, 4-0) and likely Division II No. 8 seed Teurlings Catholic (4-4, 1-3).
 “We feel our district is the toughest district in the state,” he said. “The teams that we play, we don’t back away. I think everybody in the district except maybe Northside is going to the playoffs. Game in and game out, our guys have got to be able to play. It’s a testament to our kids and to our program to be in the playoffs. This senior class has gone to the playoffs every single year, and now we’re going to host a playoff game two years in a row. The program’s going in the right direction. I’m proud of that, proud of the staff, proud of the kids. Now we’ve just got to keep on rebuilding and keep reloading.”

Alas, you’ll probably notice this is turning into a lengthy review. That’s because there is just so much going on in Valhalla, so much so that I’m having to skip some pros just to fit in the cons. The scale of the game is immense, and I found early on that even with 35+ hours of playtime I had barely made a dent in the main story. Considering each area has its own level of enemies, curious exploration led to me quickly overpowering my area and forcing me to rush the quests if I wanted to have an actual challenge in the next zone. This level scaling has been an issue since Origins, and for an RPG it’s necessary to sort out, as completionists or even those just looking for some extra loot can feel punished when they finish clearing a province only to find out they’re now far too overpowered for the next one. The size can be good, of course: those wanting their money’s worth will get it, there’s more than enough to do even if you miss a few things, and it really is hard to get tired of travelling up the rivers and raiding the countryside when the environment is so vibrant. A balance is yet to be found, however, and the length of the game could prove offputting to more casual players.

Hill isn't a bad option as a rusher, either. His career yards per carry bests both Kamara and Murray, so at least for the change-of-pace, Hill is worth rushing a few times a game, although probably not in the red zone.
 It's as a passer where Hill's role should probably totally be nixed. While it's a small-sample size, it doesn't make sense to take the ball out of Brees' hands on pass plays for a quarterback with a scattershot arm.
 And while we said we wouldn't get into it, that certainly doesn't sound like a $16-million player. But the contract is already signed, so that's mostly irrelevant. Overall, it makes sense for Payton to continue using Hill to some extent — the Saints' head man just needs to make sure his creative uses of Hill don't take away from the higher probability Kamara, Murray, Brees or Michael Thomas have of dramatically altering a game in the Saints' favor.

Wall Street’s Dulles Brothers who together ran the CIA and the State Department had made several major efforts to sabotage Kennedy’s “new frontiers” initiative that gripped the imaginations of young and old alike. Kennedy’s program was driven by large scale infrastructure at home and advanced scientific and technological progress in the Developing sector abroad. Attempting to break that trajectory, Allen Dulles had prepared the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba months before Kennedy entered the scene which was a near disaster for the world. Just days before Kennedy’s inauguration, Allan Dulles ensured that a pro-Kennedy ally who had just recently gained power in the Congo named Patrice Lumumba was assassinated in cold blood knowing that JFK would be blamed, and every effort was made to back up the French fascists trying to stop the Algerian independence movement behind JFK’s back. Both the Cuban invasion and the assassination of Lumumba have been blamed on Kennedy to this day.

Going back to the iPhone 12 world, new details have emerged about Apple's MagSafe Duo charger — it doesn't support 15W charging. I have some thoughts here. First off, the price for this travel-focused charger is a little high, and the fact that it doesn't even support 15W like the regular MagSafe charger? C'mon now. The report also says that the maximum supported output for the MagSafe Duo charger is 14W, so just 1W short of the 15W that the regular $39 MagSafe charger has. And to top it off, the MagSafe Duo needs a 27W charger to reach the maximum 14W output, which Apple doesn't even make. The next closest thing is the 30W charger, which is $50. Since the MagSafe Duo charger, like the iPhone 12 and MagSafe Charger before it, does not come with a power adapter, you're looking at spending about $179 minimum to use this travel charger (and we aren't even traveling like we used to).

MYETTE POINT — All the scenarios in Jason Jones’ bid to win his first Angler of the Year title in the Coteau Bass Hustlers fell in his favor Nov. 14.
 While Jones finished eighth in the nine-team regular-season finale, neither Gerald Frederick, his nearest challenger, nor Joey Trahan won the tournament in the Atchafalaya Basin.
 The margin of victory was three points, thus making attending, or missing, the last meeting of the year the difference between winning and losing AOY. Jones did and finished, after dropping his worst tournament, the last contest, with 858 points and Frederick didn’t and finished, following his own drop, with 855.
 Meeting attendance is worth five points.
 “It can come into play and it did this year. I don’t like to win like that but I’ll take it,” Jones said.
 “I feel bad for Gerald. He moved back last year (from Texas) and this is the first year he fished all of the tournaments. He was the most consistent out of anybody. He did real good.”
 A bass club spokesman noted if there was no “drop” tournament, Jones and Frederick would have finished tied at 890.
 Like Jones said, he’ll take it.
 “I’m just happy. It’s something I’ve been going after for a while. I was close last year … took the lead for a short time and lost it at Sam Rayburn. I just don’t do well there in October,” Jones said.
 “It really hasn’t sunk in yet. I’m happy. I’m competitive. It’s satisfying to compete against all of my friends and come out on top.”
 And he’ll have bragging rights for a year. Jones, a salesman for Alamo Hydraulics of Louisiana, welcomes the prospect of friendly smack talk.
 After setting his goals high this year, he’s already thinking about next year. Jones decided he won’t be as competitive in nature.
 “Now I’ll just enjoy fishing,” he said.
 Following Jones and Frederick in the Top 10 were Marlin Hebert, 831; Joey Trahan, 824; Keith Altazin, 823; Brandon Sellers, 783; Steve Doumit, 756, Doyle Louviere, 741; Robbie Mayer, 736, and Tim Sturm, 729.
 The bass club’s one-two finishers in the final standings fished a tournament together and won on June 13 at Lake Fausse Pointe. Jones and Frederick’s limit weighed 10.34 pounds.
 That was Jones’ first of three straight first-place finishes. He’s proud of that streak.
 “That’s what kind of helped me out, that three in a row,” he said.
 One of those wins was his most satisfying tournament, he said, noting he fished with Steve Doumit, a first cousin by marriage, in the Atchafalaya Basin. They won with 13.85 pounds.
 “We had a good day. Everything fell into place. We scouted and everything came together,” he said about the seventh tournament, which is when he took over first place.
 He fared better in the nation’s last great overflow swamp than he has before, Jones said, adding, “It’s not my strongest point.”
 “This year I got to fish the Basin more. I did a lot more scouting. We (Jones and Doumit) put a lot of work in the Basin, caught a lot of bass. It paid off,” he said.
 He focused on improving his one-dimensional bass fishin’. Before this year he relied on soft plastics and a finesse style presentation.
 “To be honest, I started fishing a little different this year. I switched to crank baits and Whopper Ploppers. Those were my go-to baits. They make me a more versatile fisherman. That’s what the guys in the club are like, so versatile,” he said.

Anxiety was the rope that fastened us to The Weather Channel and other forecasters.
 Almost two months ago, after the meteorologists confirmed that Hurricane Delta would likely strengthen and make landfall in south Louisiana, L. and I remained glued to the different stations awaiting every update. We watched with concern as the track kept shifting westward. Every movement towards us was a reminder of that other beast, Laura, and what it had recently done to Cameron and Lake Charles.
 About three days before Delta hit, the storm moved even more toward the central and western parishes. Seeing its unpredictability in both direction and strength as well as the fact that our house was almost surrounded by older trees, I decided that it was in our best interest to evacuate.
 But where to go?
 I wanted a location away from the hurricane’s strongest winds yet close enough to return home within a couple of hours in order to assess what kind of malicious calling card Delta might leave us and immediately start cleaning up...or making repairs.
 We chose Thibodaux.
 After some calls and some quick packing we hit the road after first topping off our SUV’s gas tank.
 Our motel was an attractive lodging that appeared to have recently been refurbished. To my surprise I saw that it was almost completely occupied. After unpacking and, of course, setting the TV to one of the local stations, I walked around the place. Some kids played ball near the pool and an elderly couple sat nearby on a bench.
 Everything was calm but I felt a certain uneasiness within me. L. and I were in a place we didn’t want to be, but had to for our safety. However, my thoughts kept returning to our home and how well it would bear up to Delta.
 The couple in the room next to ours occasionally came out to smoke. They looked edgy and exhausted. After a while we introduced ourselves and got into a revealing conversation.
 Brad and Elma were from Jennings. He explained that during Laura much of his roof had been ripped off by the wind. He was still in the process of making repairs when Hurricane Delta’s approach forced them to flee.
 “Right now we feel lost.” Brad confessed. “We only have half a house and we don’t know what we’ll find when we return. But whatever happens...it’s where we want to stay.”
 Although stressed out, I felt that they both possessed a deep reservoir of both courage and perseverance. Their spirits, although subdued, were far from shattered.
 Brad continued, “We won’t abandon our home. We fixed it once and if necessary...we’ll do it again.” Elma put her arm around her husband’s waist.
 The storm passed and we went our separate ways. After arriving home there was a broken limb leaning against our house but no damage to the dwelling. The next day a chain saw easily took care of it.
 I thought of Brad and Elma and hoped that if they had any hurricane problems they’d be very minor ones.
