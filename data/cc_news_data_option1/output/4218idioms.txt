But a judge found Jackson Williams not guilty of intending to commit a sexual offence. The 21-year-old was found guilty in the County Court of Victoria on Tuesday of assaulting a stranger on the morning of October 28, 2018 – captured in its entirety on CCTV. He was found not guilty of his second charge, with judge Mandy Fox finding the 21-year-old’s state of the mind at the time could not be proven. “He did not say or do anything consistent with robbery, but nor did he say or do anything consistent with an intent to commit a sexual assault,” she said. She said the Westmeadows Tigers player’s attack lasted 37 seconds, from the time he grabbed the victim by the neck from behind and pulled her into an alley to when an off-duty cop heard the woman screaming and ran to help. The 39-year-old nurse was wearing a long padded coat and listening to music as she headed for her 7am shift at a hospital. Her headphones were knocked out and her glasses fell on the ground during the attack, which started when Williams suddenly jumped up from the step where he was smoking, put her in a headlock and forced her from Little Lonsdale Street into Brights Place. She stumbled over and he pressed his body onto her and covered her mouth as she attempted to free herself, Judge Fox said.The victim told the court Williams was “really strong”. “She tried to fight and grab him and push him away,” Judge Fox said.“She was really frightened and scared.“Her body was lying on the ground, her face was up, and she kept screaming.”A New Zealand police officer who was staying in Melbourne on a family holiday happened to walk past, heading with his partner and two young children to catch an early bus to Phillip Island. He handed his daughter, who was in a backpack on his back, to his partner and ran into the alley, shouting “oi!”, the court heard. The CCTV footage shows Williams looking up and then jogging away into nearby Healeys Lane.He later told police he got home about 7am and went to bed. He had spent the night at nightclubs in Essendon and the CBD and told police he had been drunk and couldn’t remember the attack.Prosecutor Stephanie Clancy argued Williams could not be seen in the CCTV footage trying take the victim’s backpack or her mobile phone, and he did not make any threats or demands.“When a man pulls a woman off the street and into a deserted laneway … it strains credulity to think he could have any other purpose except a sexual one,” she said.But Judge Fox agreed with the defence that he also could not be seen trying to touch the victim in a sexual manner or trying to remove either of their clothing. “There is no direct evidence as to the accused’s state of mind,” she said.“I must not guess, speculate or jump to conclusions.”Williams remained on the Westmeadows Tigers line-up – part of the Essendon District Football League – as of 2019, with the 2020 season suspended due to COVID-19. His trial was judge alone rather than being before a jury. Williams had pleaded guilty to assault but Judge Fox ordered the charge also proceed to trial along with intent to commit a sexual offence, to which he had pleaded not guilty.He will be sentenced at a later date.

Now Bastian Schweinsteiger has joined fellow former Bayern and Germany players Didi Hamann and Lothar Matthaeus in calling for Mueller to be reinstated."If I was national coach, Mueller as well as Boateng would be in the national side," Schweinsteiger, 36, told Monday's edition of German magazine Kicker.Schweinsteiger helped win the 2014 World Cup in Brazil alongside Mueller, who knows he still has plenty to offer Germany after 100 internationals and 38 goals for 'die Mannschaft'."Everyone can see that I am in good form. Let's just see what happens," Mueller told broadcaster ZDF on Saturday, yet Loew has so far showed no signs of reversing his decision.Last month, Mueller became the most successful German footballer of all time -- surpassing Schweinsteiger's record of 26 titles -- when Bayern won the German Super Cup as he lifted a trophy for the 27th time in his career.After an early season plagued by tired legs and defensive wobbles, Bayern will need Mueller's creativity against an Atletico side who have conceded just one goal in four games so far this season.Bayern, who won their first ever European Cup against Atletico back in 1974, will begin their Champions League defence behind closed doors.Kimmich returnThe Bavarians have a perfect record at home against Diego Simeone's side, having twice beaten them in Munich in 2016.  Yet Atletico knocked Bayern out of the semi-finals in 2015/16 and the German side remain wary of their Spanish opponents.Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer warned that Atletico are a "strong team" who were "uncomfortable" to play against."The good thing is that the game is on Wednesday, so we have an extra day to prepare," said the Bayern captain.After having less than a month between last season's Champions League final and the first Bundesliga weekend, Bayern's relentless schedule has continued apace.  Wednesday's game will be their third in six days, while further Champions League fixtures against Salzburg and Lokomotiv Moscow mean Bayern have midweek and weekend games in each of the next three weeks.The physical strain and the need to rotate has led to a few early-season hiccups.Bayern suffered a shock 4-1 defeat to Hoffenheim last month, and needed a late Robert Lewandowski penalty to seak a 4-3 win over Hertha Berlin before the international break.On Saturday, Flick criticised his team for a poor second half performance, after individual errors led to a goal for Bielefeld and a red card for Bayern's Corentin Tolisso.They can ill-afford a repeat against Atletico.Others have also noted Bayern's lapses in concentration at the back, which has seen Neuer let in five goals in four league games so far.Matthaeus has accused the champions of being "passive" and "vulnerable" at the back this season.Joshua Kimmich should bring more stability to Bayern's midfield, with the Germany midfielder expected to return after he missed last weekend's game to be with his wife, who is expecting the couple's second child."Joshua is very important for us against Atletico. I hope he can play," Flick told Sky.",

"articleBody": "Thomas Mueller can further fuel appeals for him to be recalled by Germany when Bayern Munich launch their Champions League defence at home to Atletico Madrid on Wednesday behind closed doors. Having managed a record 21 assists in the Bundesliga last season, Mueller has continued his sparkling form by scoring five goals and creating four more so far in 2020/21. The 31-year-old netted twice in a 4-1 win at Arminia Bielefeld last Saturday when Robert Lewandowski also grabbed two goals for Bayern. His latest eye-catching club performance has prompted fresh hopes of a Germany recall for Mueller, who was dropped by Joachim Loew from the national set-up in 2019 alongside Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels.

Experts agree that the climate crisis's most destructive manifestations, on display in a particularly difficult year for the US, barely scratch the surface of the catastrophes to come. Yet the president appears unmoved by the enormous wildfires, devastating hurricanes, widespread water problems and persistent air pollution that disproportionately blights black and Latino communities. His administration has scrapped climate regulations, rolled back clean water rules and loosened pollution standards. Protections for public land and threatened species have been shrunk while new oil pipelines and coal mining have been encouraged.
