KELLOGG, Idaho (AP) — Officials at a northern Idaho ski resort say they have recovered the body of a second skier who was killed in an avalanche that also injured five skiers. Silver Mountain Resort spokesman Gus Colburn said all the skiers in the area of the avalanche Tuesday morning are now believed to be accounted for. The avalanche happened about 11 a.m. on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficultly level. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area with dogs and probes. Five people with minor injuries were found during the day, a sixth skier was discovered under about 10 feet (3 meters) of snow and the final skier was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. The names of the skiers have not been made public. “Silver Mountain extends our deepest condolences to everyone affected, and out of respect to the families, no further comments will be released at this time,” the resort said on Facebook.

MADRID (AP) — Spanish maritime authorities say a dead newborn baby has been found on a boat of migrants as the vessel headed for Spain's Canary Islands from the west coast of North Africa. Spain's maritime rescue service said one of its planes spotted a rubber boat carrying 43 passengers on Wednesday 15 nautical miles east of the Lanzarote island port of Arrecife. The Spanish service said a rescue crew tried to revive a lifeless baby on board without success. Migrants on the boat told authorities the child was born at sea as they attempted to reach the European islands. The Canary Islands' emergency services tweeted that two women and another child from the rescued boat were taken to the hospital on Lanzarote.

SHAHEDSHAHR, Iran (AP) — A Ukrainian passenger jet carrying 176 people crashed on Wednesday, just minutes after taking off from the Iranian capital’s main airport, turning farmland on the outskirts of Tehran into fields of flaming debris and killing all on board.
 The crash of Ukraine International Airlines came hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers, but Iranian officials said they suspected a mechanical issue brought down the 3½-year-old Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ukrainian officials initially agreed, but later backed away and declined to offer a cause while the investigation is ongoing.
 The plane carried 167 passengers and nine crew members from different nations. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said that there were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians on board — the Ukrainian nationals included two passengers and the nine crew. There were also 10 Swedish, four Afghan, three German and three British nationals, he said.
 Airline officials said most of the passengers were en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, transiting through there to other destinations. Staff at the Boryspil airport in Kyiv, told The Associated Press that passengers on this flight are usually Iranian students coming back to Ukraine after winter holidays.
 Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy extended his condolences to the families of the victims. His office said he had cut his visit to Oman short and was returning to Kyiv because of the crash. The country’s Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk confirmed the casualty toll.

"What did you say?" said my husband. "You think I need to get my meerkat net?"      "No. I said, 'I think you need to get your hearing checked!'" I sighed.      "My hearing is fine," he argued. "You were mumbling."      I shook my head. I am not a mumbler. Nor am I a soft-talker or a dog- whisperer. If anything, I'm typically whisper-challenged ... which is why I knew the issue was my husband, not me.      "Just go to the audiologist," I said.      "Why do I need an archeologist," he wondered.      I just stared at him and then left the room, muttering under my breath. Now if he didn't hear me at least there was good reason.      I, myself, had recently been diagnosed with an issue called Hidden Hearing Loss, which is really just a problem hearing conversation in a crowded room. On a side note, I also suffered from Silent Reflux and Phantom Knee Pain, so apparently, all my problems were secret ones. My husband, however, had a hard time hearing me clearly all the time. It was pretty obvious, at least to me, that there was nothing phantom about his hearing issues, although he may have had some not-so-hidden denial about it.      "I hear everything I need to hear," he said      "So, you have Selective Hearing Loss," I said.      "I dunno. Maybe," he replied.      "Which means you have elected not to hear me," I said.      He shrugged. "I probably can't hear my mother, either."      Eventually he went to get his hearing checked just to prove me wrong, and was surprised when the audiologist gave him her diagnosis.      "You have 'Spousal Hearing Loss,'" she said confidently.      "What does that mean?" we asked.      "You are tuning out the frequencies of your wife's speech," she said to my husband.      "Just me?" I wondered.      "Maybe his mother, too," she said. Clearly, she'd been around the block a few times with this topic.      "So, this is really a thing?" I asked her.      "Not officially," she replied. "But I do see a lot of it."   When we got home, I wondered if my husband would be able to hear me if I spoke an octave higher or lower. I decided to try out some different frequencies when talking to him to see if my theory worked. I am typically an alto so I had a wide range of other vocal ranges I could try.      "What do you want to do about dinner?" I sang in my highest operatic soprano. My husband was in the next room, so I thought it was a good test of our theory. I wasn't sure if he would hear me, but there was a good chance I might get a female solo in the next Met performance of La Traviata. At the very least, I knew at that pitch the dog could hear me.      "Yeah, I think you look a little thinner," he replied when he walked into the kitchen.      So, clearly going an octave higher didn't help.      "How about some fish," I asked, dropping my voice down to a tenor.      "Yes, honey," he said, coming behind me and wrapping his arms around my waist. "You are definitely a dish."      I smiled. Maybe this hearing loss issue wasn't such a bad thing.

One big plus point for and from us on this is the willingness of staff to help with allergies – an issue with dairy means that the DD’s companion asked for the paradox of a vegan burger but with meat in it. Not only were they helpful but they were very attentive, as they were to make sure that our milk-allergic two-year-old was found something that he’d a) like and b) not have a flare-up after. And given that we had turned up for lunch before most people get out of bed at the weekend, the staff were kind/sympathetic in allowing us to have a burger each even though the kitchen was still officially on breakfast menu. Full marks for that, and also for service that in general was friendly and efficient.
 A couple of weeks later, we were in Gunwharf again and thought we’d give it another go. This time, trying but failing to experiment beyond a burger, the DD opted for a bacon cheese (does what it says on the tin, £9.95), and more chilli cheese fries, because you just can’t not. Again, spot on.

Israel, which has criticized the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, has been quiet about the drone strike aside from a brief statement of praise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seemingly disinclined to escalate an already volatile situation between its closest ally and its sworn enemy. Trump’s first face to face meeting with an ally came Monday with the Saudi deputy defense minister, Khalid bin Salman. But he didn’t confirm it until a day later, after the prince revealed it in a tweet.
