In his dissent, Justice O’Donnell noted that after the Court issued the one- page rejection of the DP&L rate plan the PUCO removed the disallowed rate stability rider and ruled its action constituted a “modification” of the company’s ESP and that it allowed ESP II to be withdrawn. Justice O’Donnell’s dissent pointed out that the PUCO was not exercising its discretion to permit a modification, but rather the commission acted pursuant to an order of the Ohio Supreme Court that directed the PUCO to account for the $285 million windfall collected by DP&L. The PUCO allowed DP&L to replace the withdrawn plan but never accounted for the $285 million.

Această nouă măsură ar putea tensiona şi mai mult relaţiile dintre Washington şi Beijing.
 În acest caz precis, autorităţile americane afirmă că şi-au dat seama că Huawei a reuşit să ocolească restricţiile impuse din 2019. Huawei şi 114 filiale fuseseră plasate atunci pe o listă neagră, care le obliga să obţină o licenţă pentru a putea exporta produse americane.
 "Totuşi, Huawei a continuat să utilizeze programe informatice şi tehnologie americană pentru a dezvolta seminconductori, subminand prin aceasta securitatea naţională a SUA şi obiectivul diplomatic al listei (respective), comandandu-şi producţia in străinătate de la uzine care utilizează echipamente americane", acuză ministerul.
 "Nu aşa trebuie să se comporte o companie de talie mondială care se vrea responsabilă", a denunţat secretarul american al comerţului Wilbur Ross.
 "Trebuie să ne schimbăm regulile exploatate de Huawei şi HiSilicon (o filială a gigantului de telecomunicaţii care fabrică semiconductori) pentru a nu permite ca tehnologii americane să servească activităţilor răuvoitoare contrare intereselor securităţii naţionale ale SUA şi politicii lor externe", a insistat Ross.

Between 1970 and 1999, the flow of molten, magnetic material in Earth's outer core changed. Because of these changes, the researchers say, the magnetic blob lurking beneath Canada slowly elongated in the early aughts, weakening the corresponding magnetic intensity on Earth's surface.
 Eventually, the blob of molten material beneath Canada split in two and the stronger one slowly shifted toward the blob beneath Siberia. This spurred the magnetic north pole to slip closer and closer to Siberia, where the magnetic intensity was stronger.
 In 2017, the magnetic north pole fell within 240 miles of the geographic north pole. The movement has been so rapid that the British Geological Survey and U.S. National Geophysical Data Center, which update the World's Magnetic Model, had to accelerate their process in order to keep up.
 The scientists generated a series of models of Earth's core in an effort to understand how it might move in the future. "Our predictions are that the pole will continue to move towards Siberia, but forecasting the future is challenging and we cannot be sure," the study's lead author, geophysicist Phil Livermore of the University of Leeds, told _Live Science_.
 These shifts have major consequences for global navigation systems. Anything or anyone that uses a compass--from ships at sea to the smart phones in our pockets--is impacted by this magnetic game of tug-o-war.

When Red Sox fans picked up their Sunday Sun Chronicle on the morning of Sept. 3, 2011, they may have been disappointed that the Yankees still held a half- game lead in the division, but all was still right in the world. After all, the Sox were 84-54 for the third-best record in all of baseball, but also held a nine-game lead over the third-place Tampa Bay Rays, and at worst, a wild- card berth was virtually clinched.
 In reality, somebody had figured out that the odds for Boston to reach the postseason stood at 99.6 percent on Sept. 3. Its bats led the majors in OPS, and its collective team batting average stood at .280, which was second-best in baseball.
 What could go wrong?
 Spoiler alert: plenty.
 In a nutshell, the Red Sox won only six games the rest of the way, while losing 18. Still, on the final night of the regular season, a Rays’ loss to the high-flying Yankees, or a Boston win over the last-place Orioles, would clinch the wild-card berth for Boston. Easy — until it wasn’t.
 But first, how those gagging Red Sox blew such a big lead and turned a promising season into a collapse for the ages.
 On Sept. 3, Lackey and reliever Felix Dubront coughed up nine runs in five- plus innings in a 11-4 home loss to Texas. A day later, the potent Boston bats went silent in a 1-0 loss to a pitching-weak Toronto team that was hovering around .500.
 The next night, the Sox’ ship seemed to have righted itself with a 14-0 pasting of the Jays, with ace Lester spinning the three-hit gem and Boston pounding out a season-high 20 hits. The offense continued to roll the next night, as Boston took an 8-6 lead into the bottom of the eighth, but Daniel Bard proceeded to give up five runs on just one hit (along with three walks) and Toronto came away with an 11-10 victory, followed by another Jays’ victory a day later.
 What happened next was the defining point of the season, when the Sox went in to Tropicana Field and dropped three straight to the surging Rays, getting outscored 22-8. When the series was over, Tampa Bay’s deficit behind Boston was already down to just three-and-a-half games. A week later, when the Rays came to Fenway and took three of four from the Olde Towne Team, the wild-card lead was down to just two, and Boston had dropped 11 of 14.

Regular readers of this page will know that every month for years a letter of mine has appeared on these pages. But this letter was not printed.
 I have no entitlement to have a letter printed here each month. But when a longstanding pattern is broken, you kind of wonder why.
 Every day since your editorial, and since my rebuttal was not printed, the pattern of enhanced risk for African Americans — and even greater enhanced risk for Native Americans — has become clearer. Every day it has become clearer that these communities, with their own members in the lead, must get the substantial resources they need to keep people alive.
 It is definitely true that “Some politicians in the United States tend to seize upon anything in attempts to woo voters.” Yes, and some editorialists tend to support them. Today, some politicians and editorialists have “seized upon” the idea that the pandemic is not real bad, and have chosen to ignore the plain fact that it does harm some communities more. They want us to ignore the realities that risky plans to “re-open” will especially benefit those who live safely with millions to invest, and will especially harm those of us, like me, who are elderly, and those of us who will actually be put at face-to- face risk in low-paying jobs.
 I agree that biases have no legitimate role in science. I wish they had no role in politics, including the policies of editorial pages.

Carp are wide open for both regular anglers fishing dough bait and bowfishermen sticking them in the shallows. The carp are congregating in the shallows for the spawn.

WINCHESTER — After working the night shift, Philip Swanson and Lucky Orndorff had a longstanding tradition of meeting for post-work beers. But the coronavirus outbreak put a halt to that.
 On Friday, though, that sense of normalcy started to return as businesses began to open up under Gov. Ralph Northam’s Phase One plan.
 Swanson and Orndorff joined other friends at an outside table at Macado’s on the Loudoun Street Mall on Friday and shared laughs and smiles around a table of beer mugs, shot glasses and appetizers.
 “This was kind of our thing for awhile before the virus, where we’d meet up after working night shift and grab a beer. So, we said let’s have a beer and see if we can’t normalize in some of this stuff that’s going on,” Swanson said. “We’re being smart, of course.”
 Most of the group explained they were essential personnel and had been working throughout the pandemic, so they said they appreciated the opportunity to step away from work for a bit.
 “It’s nice to have a place to get off work and have a beer,” Orndorff said.
 “Seeing people and being around people hasn’t been anything new for us,” added Jenni Massie, who brought her dog along for the outing. “We’re already out and about. It sucks that people are scared to come out, but it makes sense that people that don’t have to be out aren’t out.”
 Places like the Loudoun Street Mall weren’t as busy as they are on a typical 80 degree spring day, but the folks who did venture out seemed to have no issues as the state begins its reopening.
 In the first phase of the governor’s plan, restaurants, beverage services, farmers markets, brick and mortar retail shops, fitness and exercise facilities, personal care and grooming services, campgrounds and summer camps, and religious services were given guidelines on catering to needs on a limited basis.
 Apple Blossom Mall reopened on Friday, although some stores chose not to reopen yet.
 All businesses reopening were given guidelines for physical distancing, enhanced cleaning and disinfection and enhanced workplace safety practices, which can be found at www.virginia.gov/coronavirus/forwardvirginia.
 Restaurants and bars were encouraged to continue take-out and delivery options with the option to open outdoor seating. Businesses are required to post signage at the entrance of the establishment prohibiting entry for those with a fever or symptoms of COVID-19 or known exposure to COVID-19 within the last 14 days. Signage is also needed to promote social distancing and to remind patrons of rules about gatherings and options for high-risk individuals. Those who are sick are encouraged to stay home.
 Outdoor seating occupancy is limited to no more than 50% of the lowest occupancy load allowed at the establishment and a minimum of 6 feet is to be kept between individuals as much as possible, including parties at tables. No more than 10 patrons are supposed to be seated at the same table, even if multiple tables are pushed together unless marked with 6-foot divisions. Bar seating is supposed to be off limits for seating options.
 Before patrons started showing up for lunch on Friday, Brewbaker’s owner Laura Vaughn and her staff were busy making final swoops to re-sanitize and make sure the seating options were up to par on the Loudoun Street Mall.

Today the US and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals are capped at 1,550 nuclear delivery systems each by the limits set forth in the New START Treaty. While both sides recognize the desirability of additional reductions, the insistence on the part of the Trump administration that any future arms control agreement on strategic nuclear weapons must include China has thrown a monkey wrench in an arms control process which for decades has been governed on the basis of US-Soviet/Russian bilateral agreements. Even something as simple as extending the existing New START treaty for five years in order to buy time for the complexities of transitioning bilateral arms control structures into a new trilateral reality is unacceptable to Washington.

Johnny Washington, Case, 1977
 On March 7, 1977, that day after John McGuire won his sixth state championship for St. Catherine’s, Park hosted 19-0 Case, the state’s top-ranked team, in a WIAA Class A regional in a packed fieldhouse.
 Behind Washington, a 6-1 forward who joined St. Catherine’s Harvey Knuckles as a first-team AP All-State selection that season, Case was favored. But after losing to the potent Eagles twice during the regular season, Park coach Tom Sager used a slow, deliberate offense and pulled off a stunning 41-39 victory.
 That doesn’t detract from Washington’s career. He averaged 14.5 points as a senior on a balanced Case team — teammates Kevin Berryhill and John Geshay also earned first-team All-County honors that season — and went on to greater things.

We carry a very nice level of backlog. We’re improving our margins, growth profitability margins and operationally, we continue to invest in our future. You just saw a taste of what we do right now in this turbulent period and our technological offerings. So the company is not just in business, it’s executing a midterm, long-term strategy. So the valuation is indeed problematic. The cash, the stock repurchase program is something that we discuss internally. We also have this subject raised, and we understand why during the recent investor’s calls, we are – it’s one of the things that we are looking at. It’s definitely one of the things that could be done. However, at our current stage, we do everything to stick to our midterm and long-term goals, which includes execution of M&A transactions in a significant – relatively significant volumes and magnitude to boost the business inorganically. We invest in technology and in organic growth as well and added this to the high uncertainty that we currently see in the industry and the market, I mean, economic environment. This is not – at the moment, this is not the leading option. But this is something that is on the table and we review it.

(CBS News) - Last month, a 2-year-old girl who had been in foster care for 700 days was finally adopted by her family in Jacksonville, Florida. Even though social distancing guidelines are preventing people from getting together, Isla's adoption by the Moody family received a special celebration from their community. Isla's mom, Cayela Moody, told CBS News she and her husband, Evan, had submitted paperwork for the adoption before the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. However, when stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines were put in place, courts had to shutter their doors.So, they were surprised to get the call that courts had reopened after more than six weeks, and Isla’s adoption hearing was scheduled for just a week later.Isla, her parents, their children, Nolan, Harrison, Margaret, and Evelyn and another foster child in their care gathered for a Zoom adoption hearing on April 30. That day, Isla officially became a Moody – the family she’s been with since she was seven days old. Moody said she is very involved in a foster care community in Jacksonville called Fostering Hope. “I thought we would plan a party to thank everyone who loved her after social distancing restrictions were limited,” Moody told CBS News. “But, I also knew that they truly wanted to be a part of the day.”So, community members decorated their cars with balloons and banners and drove past the Moodys' house to congratulate Isla. "We were blown away at how this group has loved us so well along our journey!" Moody said. "Because Evan is in the military, we sadly do not have family close. So, the parade consisted of a lot of Fostering Hope members, other foster families we have walked alongside, and some of our church members as well," she continued.The Fostering Hope community got right back to work after celebrating Isla’s adoption, because there are other foster kids in their area that need support. “We delivered two dozen ‘Bags of Hope’ to local foster families and prepared over 100 freezer meals to be delivered. So, we celebrated, and then we hit the ground running!” Moody said. The group has helped her family with child care, meals – and comfort. "They sent cards and showed up with coffee on hard days," she said. "They loved our foster children and welcomed them as a part of our family," the mom said. "We need great families coming alongside these children and their parents to support them during very challenging times."Moody said May is Foster Care Awareness Month, and she wants to use this time to remind people that “foster children need people that are willing to raise their hands and say, ‘I can be forever.’” Now, the Moodys are Isla’s forever.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said the monetary policy committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points to eight percent as the inflation outlook improved further in light of the recent cut in domestic fuel prices and could fall closer to the lower end of the previously announced ranges of 11-12 percent this fiscal year and 7-9 percent next fiscal year.
 “While easier monetary policy can neither affect the rate of infection transmission nor prevent the near-term fall in economic activity due to lockdowns, it can provide liquidity support to households and businesses to help them through the ensuing temporary phase of economic disruption,” the SBP said in a statement. “In particular, the successive policy rate cuts and sizeable cheap loans provided through the SBP’s enhanced refinancing facilities have helped maintain credit flows, bolster the cash flow of borrowers, and support asset prices. This has contained the tightening of financial conditions that would otherwise have amplified the initial necessary contraction in activity.”
 State Bank slashed its benchmark policy rate by 525 basis points to 8 percent since March 17 in an emergency effort to offset economic impact of the novel coronavirus.
 SBP said the swift and forceful monetary easing of 525 basis points in the two months since the beginning of the crisis. There were three key developments since the last monetary policy committee meeting on 16 April, 2020. The government significantly reduced petrol and diesel prices by 30-40 percent in response to the continued fall in global oil prices, which improved the outlook for inflation. Most countries, including Pakistan, have begun easing lockdowns, which should help provide support to economic activity. The initial volatility observed in domestic financial and foreign exchange markets has somewhat subsided in recent weeks due to timely policy actions and international assistance, although global financial conditions remain considerably tighter than before the coronavirus outbreak.
 “Recent supportive developments have helped to restore the SBP’s foreign reserves position to close to pre-coronavirus levels of over $12 billion,” it said.
 SBP said the inflation outlook is subject to two-sided risks.
 “Inflation could fall further than expected if economic activity fails to pick up as expected next fiscal year,” it said. “On the other hand, there are some upside risks from potential food-price shocks associated with adverse agricultural conditions. Price pressures could also emerge if the economy gains greater momentum in the second half of FY21.”
 State Bank said activity in service sectors and consumption, which form a large part of the domestic economy, could remain subdued for longer in light of preliminary evidence from China and other countries that eased lockdowns earlier than others.
 The central bank said there are potential downside risks given the economic difficulties across the world, especially in oil exporting countries, while remittances have so far remained resilient.
 “Despite challenging global conditions, the outlook for external sector broadly remains stable,” it said. “The current account deficit should remain bounded and the recent fall in portfolio inflows will be offset by official flows committed by the international community, such that Pakistan’s external position remains fully funded. Together, these developments, buttressed by the flexible exchange rate regime, should continue to support a steady build up in the SBP’s foreign exchange reserve buffers.”
 State Bank said the substantial fall in economic activity since March has significantly affected tax revenues. After rising by 17.5 percent year-on-year during July-February FY20, tax revenues declined sharply by 15 percent year- on-year in both March and April. “Moreover, given the needed increase in spending to support healthcare, businesses, households and more vulnerable segments of society, the fiscal deficit is expected to widen substantially in Q4.”

While we wait for the Major League Baseball Players Union to collectively decide whether it’s going to agree to the shortened-season terms set out earlier this week by MLB’s forces that be, let’s take a break from two straight weeks of focusing on the 2004 Yankees’ ALCS collapse, and instead turn the tables and look at another classic collection of choking dogs: the 2011 Boston Red Sox.
 In spring training, the Boston Herald trumpeted that squad as potentially “The Best Team Ever!” Admittedly, it was a really good team, coming off a somewhat- disappointing 89-73 campaign in 2010 but having added superstar Carl Crawford via free agency and slugger Adrian Gonzalez through a trade with the Padres. The Sox already had holdovers Dustin Pedroia, David Ortiz, Kevin Youkilis, Jacoby Ellsbury, and J.D. Drew from a team just four years removed from its second World Series of the decade. In the rotation were Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, John Lackey, Tim Wakefield, and Clay Buchholz, and the bullpen was still anchored by Gronk-esque closer Jonathan Papelbon. This team was truly loaded, and expectations were high.
 Yet the Yankees were still a talented team as well, and had celebrated their most recent championship just two seasons earlier. The two teams played leapfrog for most of the season for supremacy in the AL East.

The ruling party’s unstated but palpable advantage is its dominant position in the two parliamentary chambers. Nonetheless, the ruling party should not use its dominant position to push opposition politicians and parties into a Hobson’s Choice of accepting all its political positions without dialogue and compromise.

Ferreira, who grew up in Attleboro but recently bought a house in Seekonk, says the “crew” is about 25 deep and includes both women’s friends and family.
 Before the virus, the friends would get together once a month to celebrate birthdays, have a themed party, play games or enjoy a simple barbecue. Ferreira and her husband, Richard, had just started planning their birthday party for April when the virus shut down life as we know it.
 Now the friends have been taking part in group chats and trying to stay as connected as possible.
 “This is the longest time I haven’t been able to see Nicole in 20 years,” Ferreira said.
 To keep busy while she isn’t working, hanging out with friends or able to see her other best friend, her mother, Beverly Gaboury of Attleboro, Ferreira is making masks, turning her dining room table into a sewing factory.
 “I’ll do anything to help people stay safe,” she said.

Locals proffer advice on what they see as necessities and add a few delicacies on the open pages of Pat’s ideas notebook. Within 24 hours, they’re invariably on the shelves. From sellotape to sherry.
 “I've a bit of a thing for 'Catch' bars and within two days they were on the shelf,” confirms Heather Groves-Sugrue from nearby Gortagullane. “They stock everything from Castlegregory carrots to the daily papers.”
 That so many of his suppliers are native to the parish not only accelerates delivery but accentuates the reassuringly indigenous feel of this unlikely success story.
 The old glass bottles of milk and cream from Chris Maloney’s Ballymac Dairy, ‘real’ honey from the O’Sullivans and the McNultys, freshly-made coleslaw and creamy pasta from Con Leen Salads, Kay’s Scones, Dan’s bakery, Pa Walsh’s fruit and veg. Local eggs and jam joust on the shelves with briquettes, stamps and apple tarts.
 Mass cards signed by the parish priest alongside reusable cotton facemasks, manufactured locally and selling out at €4 each. The sheet of prayers and parish news from lock-downed church masses in Ballymac and Clogher greet visitors at the door.

While COVID-19 outbreaks are generally localized within countries, most governments have taken a shotgun approach of issuing blanket restrictions. So even though most gold mines are largely self-contained remote operations far from civilization, they’ve been hammered by countrywide orders to stop work. Gold miners still operating today may be forced to suspend operations tomorrow, and vice versa.
 The Canadian province of Quebec has been a great example of the inherent unpredictability of all these lockdowns. In late March its government mandated a province-wide COVID-19 shutdown which forced Quebec’s major gold-mining industry offline. But just a few weeks later in mid-April, provincial officials changed their minds and reclassified mining as _essential businesses!_ So Quebec’s gold mines spun back up.
 Quebec claimed it exempted miners from its lockdown because their commodities are critical in medical-equipment supply chains. That may be true, but I suspect the real reason was restarting the big lost tax revenue from mining. Unlike the US Federal Reserve, most governments simply can’t print the equivalent of _trillions of dollars_ to paper over their lockdown-imposed economic catastrophes. So they are reopening mines.
 Gold-mining operations are ideally suited for social distancing to retard COVID-19’s spread. Being way out in the sticks, mining employees are relatively isolated. They either live in small local towns near the mines or in man camps working for multi-week shifts onsite. One thing Quebec ordered is that fly-in shifts be extended from 14 days to 28 days to minimize infection exposure. Gold mines won’t stay closed for long.
 While wading through the GDX top 34’s quarterly results, it was interesting to see the managers of gold-mining companies are as angry as everyone else about governments killing their businesses by decree. But they have to be politically-correct, trying not to make local officials mad who could hinder their return to operational status. First Majestic Silver (AG) exemplified this, even though it hadn’t reported Q1 by Wednesday.

"We appreciate the challenges that our customers and our community are facing. This is an opportunity to help our customers and provide a lift to the Maryland economy when it is needed most," said Carim Khouzami, CEO of BGE. "Prior to the pandemic, we had been designing a forward-looking energy infrastructure investment plan as part of the state's multi-year plan pilot. In light of the economic challenges created by the pandemic, we have been able to structure the plan to provide both near-term relief for customers and longer-term stimulus for the Maryland economy. The energy infrastructure investments we make translate into service benefits for our customers and communities and steady employment and financial assurance for the more than 900 supplier companies who provide equipment and services to BGE. It is at times like this when the value of continued investments in the critical energy systems our customers depend on are most apparent, reliably powering homes, hospitals, first responders and other essential services when energy is most crucial."

An automatic wasn’t added until the BF arrived in late 2005. Although the flaws in the BA F6’s original clutch are well documented and FPV undertook a full recall, the upgraded AP-Racing unit is relatively bulletproof – good for more than 400kW at the wheels. If there’s any problem, you will notice it during a test drive; it might pop out of second gear if it’s had a particularly hard life.

A new option is to redeem Virgin Atlantic Flying Club miles for Air France/KLM flights. This would be a flight from Zone 7-West U.S. (using Los Angeles as a starting point), to Zone 4-Central Africa, which would cost 110,000 Flying Club miles each way, off-peak per person in business class. This is considerably higher than the miles required for Qatar, Turkish or Swiss so I would only be looking through KLM if there was no award space available on the other three airlines.

“When we went into quarantine, one of the first things I thought about was these kids who don’t have access to the art classroom at school anymore,” she said.
 In April, Gomez and her board of directors realigned priorities and created “Arte Libre in the Time of Corona,” a program that distributes free art kits to kids in need. The Museum of the Shenandoah Valley jumped on board and agreed to sponsor four weeks’ worth of the home art kits for 90 students at Virginia Avenue Charlotte DeHart Elementary School in Winchester. Fremont Street Nursery in Winchester heard about the art kits and ordered some for its students as well.
 Each weekly kit includes an art project and everything needed to complete it — crayons, markers, paper, paint, glue, mechanical pencils, molding putty and so on — plus written guidance and suggestions from Gomez.
 “In the first few weeks of the art kits, I’ve had five different artists create coloring pages,” Gomez said. “It inspires the youth to see something that was created by someone who looks like them or thinks like them.”
 Gomez hopes to expand the number of weekly kits and support the artists involved in their creation through crowd-funding initiatives offered via Nonprofit Matching-Fund Initiative and Ioby. Area residents can also help by buying art kits for $15 each from Arte Libre VA. For every kit purchased, the nonprofit will donate another kit to a local youth of color.
 Gomez said she hopes to continue offering the at-home art kits and expand Arte Libre VA’s mission long after the pandemic is a distant memory.
 “From the response we’ve gotten so far, this is something a lot of people feel is necessary,” she said. “There hasn’t been anything quite like this here before.”

Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. I will be brief. I hope you and your families, employees, everybody is great at Magal. As you guys probably know and many of the listeners, Mr. Willis, Mr. Liddy, Mr. Rebotsky, et al, we are collectively long-term holders. I think Mr. Willis expressed the frustration that we all have share. Of course, with your 40% holder, I don’t think the fear of a takeover would – is all that imminent. However, one thing I do wish to point out, I did on the last call and for a few years, is that we want to get the valuation up, not merely just so that everybody feels better, which is true, but the – that the shares themselves can become a vehicle as a currency for you to use for future acquisitions. That’s primarily how I see it. Irrespective, I believe you guys are aware of this, and I don’t mean to be patronizing in any manner. But realistically, putting in place a very small stock repurchase program sets a floor price, meaning what Mr. Willis was suggesting in terms of the dollar amount, buying – putting in that floor price. You don’t name a price, you put in the small percentage buyback and you never really have to execute it. It just sets a floor. It’s like having an imaginary put option for not just your shareholders, but for confidence in the marketplace that there is a price below which we will be unwilling to let this stock sink. And the reason – once again, it has nothing to do with my personal ambition, it has to do with the ability to utilize the stock down the road as a currency. So I just wanted to point that out that by putting in a small buyback, you don’t name a price, it’s a percentage and you choose when to execute it, if indeed you ever do. And it shows confidence to the marketplace. And that is one of the things I think you should consider when you are considering it the next time it comes up, that these are not mandatory, but they do set floors and they do boost confidence. And that’s what we’re looking for in terms of using the stock as a currency down the road. I have no objection to the store of capital that you have accumulated. The company since the last secondary offering, like 4.5 years ago, the value, I think, was about $3.80 and change, not the stock price, but the value of the price of those additional shares, plus or minus. I don’t have the numbers in front of me. So at cash value, for example, say, $2.35, even notwithstanding that you’ll probably draw down some of that in the next 3 months plus due to the COVID response and your R&D spending, etcetera, even at $2.20, in other words, the floor should be something that you guys pick in your mind that you do not have to speak to the public or to – we – or should to us, as shareholders, but by just putting in place the program, you are instilling confidence in the marketplace. And that, I think, would be something for you to consider. And that’s it. I didn’t mean to hog the line here. I hope everyone is well. And I think you’re doing a great job navigating, and good luck with the new product. I think you should push it. It sounds like a great way for companies to get back to reopen faster with some security. And I await any comments you have.

Aside from the protagonist switch, "Korra's" structure is a bit more fast- paced than the slow burn of "Avatar." While the original series featured an easily identifiable antagonist who served the show's narrative focal point, "Korra" switches things up between each season, rotating through a cast of villains with different ideologies and motivations. While Team Avatar's three- season campaign against the Fire Lord allowed the series to take its time with character development, "Korra's" quick pace works just as well by exposing its characters to a set of challenges that become more and more insurmountable.

Yes. Destiny. That's actually -- it's really exciting the way I look at this. We've really digitized if you will our go-to-market model and some of this was in the works prior COVID. One of the things that we've always looked at with this business is over time getting hospitals self-sufficient on doing the Pure-Vu procedure once we've come in and done all the training and are no longer at the site on a daily basis we want to be able to provide the appropriate tools to allow them to do cases without us there. So what I would say is the silver lining here with COVID is it accelerated our time and effort in these areas. So as I mentioned earlier we have been as you'd imagine utilizing some of the standard tools like Zoom and webinars. We also created this virtual training room which I think is going to be very interesting where you can call in and see a live demonstration without having to have a sales rep there.

“We’ve been revamping safety and sanitation protocols and looking at how the restaurant itself is set up,” she said. “We’ve been seeing what things we have to do to deter our guests from doing their same old habits.”
 Brewbaker’s closed in mid-March and just recently reopened a little over a week ago. Now, going from just pick-up options to seating guests again, it almost feels like opening a new restaurant, Vaughn said.
 “It’s a whole new situation in a new environment,” she said, “so it’s exciting but also nerve-wracking.”
 It wasn’t just restaurants that were finding smiling faces on Friday, though. Those who have been itching for haircuts were finally allowed to go back to their stylists. Travis Eagan, who owns Eagan & Company Barber Shop at 219 Weems Lane in Winchester, said he was happy with the amount of business they had and how well his crew adapted.
 Those adaptations included things like “getting behind the ears” with a mask on.
 “We are having the customer hold the mask in place while we go around their ears,” Eagan said. “Additionally, we have suspended straight shaves and beard trims per the governor’s order and have implemented an appointment system. All staff are wearing masks as well as customers. As per normal we are disinfecting all tools, chairs and surfaces between each customer. Our customers are waiting in their car until we call them for their appointment. Children under 12 are accompanied by one adult and the adult has to remain in a waiting chair by the front door. We have set up chairs outside for customers to wait in if they choose. Our barber chairs were already 6 feet apart, so we didn’t have to move them.”
 Whether it was catching up with friends or supporting a local business or just wanting some fresh air, those folks who were out seemed to have few reservations about COVID-19. Some wore masks, others didn’t, unless they were required to. Some shopped alone, others traveled in small groups together.
 One group of four high schoolers were waiting outside of El Centro Mexican Restaurant on the Loudoun Street Mall until it opened.
 It was prom weekend for Maggie Heishman, who attends James Wood High School, and she and her friends had missed each other and missed their favorite food spot.
 “We decided to get dressed up, take pictures and come out,” she said. “We’ve just been waiting for it to open. Supporting small businesses is big for me, so we thought it’d be cool.”
 “We used to go like every two weeks,” her friend and Millbrook High School student Mandi Clark said, “and since they didn’t offer take-out, we haven’t had it almost two months.”
 Others took the opportunity to do some late-morning shopping and get back home before the lunch and dinner crowds hit.
 “I knew there would be a lot of people out and about,” said Melissa Tusing, who was perusing Polka Dot Pot on the Loudoun Street Mall with her daughter Natalee. “So we wanted to get some things to do at home away from that.”

The quarter-on-quarter contraction is "the worst since the financial crisis" in 2009, federal statistics office Destatis said.
 The agency also revised its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for the final quarter of 2019 from zero growth to a contraction of 0.1 percent, meaning Germany has now experienced two consecutive quarters of contraction -- the technical definition of a recession.
 German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier last month warned that the country was facing "the worst recession" in its post-war history as the pandemic batters the global economy.
 Like other European countries, Germany closed factories, shops and restaurants forced many workers to stay at home to curb the outbreak from mid-March.
 Export-reliant Germany is also hard hit as international trade and travel are curtailed.
 "Private consumption, exports and investments in equipment shrank considerably as a result," the German economy ministry said in a statement.
 The second quarter is likely to show an even bigger slump before a recovery gets under way, it added.
 State consumption and the construction industry were the only growth drivers in the first three months of the year.
 "Two weeks of lockdown as well as supply chain disruptions on the back of lockdown measures elsewhere brought the German economy to its knees," said ING-Diba economist Carsten Brzeski.
 Some experts have predicted that the German economy could contract by around 10 percent between April and June.
