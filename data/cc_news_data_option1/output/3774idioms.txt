"articleBody" : "The new Herbert Hoover High School campus beginning to take shape near Elkview, W.V., "is an excellent example of planning with foresight," said Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) chief Pete T. Gaynor, who observed earth-moving work under way at the school's construction site Sept. 10. "This is what disaster mitigation is all about &mdash; you build back smarter, not the way it was before, to create something resilient for the community," Gaynor said. He made his remarks after touring a hillside cut-and-fill site preparation for the school being performed on a 246-acre tract between Interstate 79 and U.S. Highway 119 by Doss Enterprises, from Jane Lew, W.V. He was accompanied by Kanawha County Schools Superintendent Tom Williams, West Virginia Division of Emergency Management Deputy Director Mike Oakley and FEMA's Region III administrator, MaryAnn Tierney. The old high school was damaged beyond repair in June 2016 by some of the worst flooding in West Virginia history. The flashfloods across the state were generated by a series of powerful thunderstorms. With their school building destroyed, Hoover students have been attending classes in portable classroom trailers in Elkview while waiting for a new school to be funded and a site selected for it. FEMA is paying for at least $52 million of the new school's $70 million price tag. "I am pleased with the progress being made so far," Williams said. "This community has suffered a terrible loss," but will end up with a campus that is "state of the art, and something that will last at least the lifetime of its first students." Site preparation began in January, after the $19.7 million contract was awarded to Doss Enterprises. The work involves moving 2.3 million cubic yards of earth, grading and compacting the site of the new building and athletic fields, construction of an access road and utility corridors, and installation of stormwater controls. That work is now about two-thirds complete and is expected to end by late 2020. The finished Hoover High School is expected to open on time for the Fall 2022 semester. ",

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - The mother and niece of a popular restaurant owner who was shot dead by law enforcement have filed a lawsuit against LMPD, the Kentucky National Guard and several officers.David “YaYa” McAtee was shot and killed in the doorway of his barbecue restaurant in west Louisville back in June.McAtee, 53, was cooking for friends at his restaurant just after midnight on June 1. That was the Monday morning following the first weekend of Breonna Taylor protests, some of which turned violent.Minutes before McAtee was killed, LMPD and National Guard officers were called to the area of 26th Street and Broadway to disperse a crowd, law enforcement officials would say later.According to the lawsuit filed by McAtee’s mother, Odessa Riley, and niece, Maychelle McAtee, officers “blocked the intersection and yelled at a crowd at a food mart to leave, pursued and fired upon those leaving, shot into the door of the restaurant kitchen striking Mr. McAtee’s niece, Maychelle, and shot and killed David McAtee inside the kitchen of his business and home.”The day after the shooting, LMPD released two videos -- one from inside McAtee’s restaurant and one from across the street -- that the department claimed showed McAtee fired at officers first. The video did show McAtee firing a gun, but it’s difficult to say who fired first.J. Michael Brown, Gov. Andy Beshear’s executive cabinet secretary, said at a news conference eight days after the shooting that it appeared McAtee fired first and the officers “were returning fire.” Brown also said on that same day that the deadly shot was fired by a National Guardsman, not an LMPD officer.The 20-page complaint, which makes no mention of McAtee firing his gun, names LMPD officers Katie Crews and Austin Allen, other unnamed LMPD officers and unnamed Kentucky National Guard soldiers. The Guard has not released the names of its soldiers who were involved in the shooting. The lawsuit also claims the National Guard members “were out of control," and that after things had quieted in downtown Louisville earlier that evening, “officers were still amped up, armed to the hilt, and still spoiling for a fight.”Hours after the McAtee shooting, when it was determined that the LMPD officers had not turned on their body cameras, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer fired LMPD Chief Steve Conrad, who had announced just days earlier that he would retire at the end of June in part because of the department’s deadly raid on Taylor’s apartment in March.Louisville attorney Steve Romines is representing Riley and McAtee in the wrongful death lawsuit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages and also alleges assault, excessive use of force, negligence, trespassing and emotional distress. Brown said on Aug. 3 that the state’s investigation was “substantially complete,” adding that he had turned his files over to both the Jefferson County Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office and the FBI for their review.The McAtee family suffered another loss over the weekend. McAtee’s nephew, Marvin McAtee, was shot dead early Saturday morning not far from where his uncle died.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News. All rights reserved.

During both the impeachment proceedings against Governor Rod Blagojevich and the disciplinary proceedings that led to the expulsion of State Representative Derrick Smith (D-Chicago), the Illinois House was able to call witnesses. But because of ongoing federal investigations in both instances, the U.S. Attorney limited what some of those witnesses could be asked. Governor Blagojevich had been charged with multiple felonies and Representative Smith had been caught on audio accepting a cash bribe.
 “We couldn't call certain witnesses because we couldn't ask them anything but their name,” explained an attorney who worked on both cases.
 Last week, the House Republicans informed a Chicago newspaper that U.S. Attorney John Lausch had granted permission to call witnesses to the special House committee taking a look at whether disciplinary proceedings should be started against House Speaker Michael Madigan over his alleged role in a bribery scheme detailed in ComEd's Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The company, you certainly know by now, agreed to pay a $200 million fine for its alleged role, although it has entered a plea of “Not Guilty” for the time being.
 Not so fast, said the committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Chris Welch (D-Hillside). The US Attorney, Welch claimed, “requested we refrain from seeking any materials or testimony related to [ComEd's deferred prosecution agreement] that is still confidential or anything in the possession of the federal government.”
 In other words, Welch said, “We can call witnesses, but we can't really ask them any questions.”
 The committee's next step was to draft a letter memorializing the conversation with Lausch and then send it to Lausch's office for a co-sign.
 Representative Welch accused the House Republicans of playing political games. The Republicans were shocked, shocked that someone would ever suggest such a thing. Drafting a bipartisan response, therefore, proved impossible.
 So, the two parties, evenly-divided 3-3 on the committee, each drafted their own, conflicting letters.
 U.S. Attorney Lausch responded to the two letters shortly thereafter.
 “We hope this clarifies the positions we described in our September 14 call,” Lausch wrote to the committee.
 Nope. Not even close.
 The House Republicans issued an immediate statement claiming that Lausch's response had given the committee “the green light to pursue all avenues of the investigation, including testimony and documents, that were articulated in the petition.” The petition forcing the creation of the committee was filed by House Republican Leader Jim Durkin and focused mainly on ComEd's deferred- prosecution agreement.
 Welch, the committee's chairman, a successful attorney and a strong ally of House Speaker Madigan, claimed his read of Lausch's letter was that “information underlying the deferred-prosecution agreement beyond what is already public could be met with objection by federal investigators, and any further information collected by the federal government that informed that agreement is explicitly off limits.”
 Lausch did reserve the right to object to specific testimony or documents. But he also said his office didn't object “generally” to the committee's “pursuit of testimony or production of documents,” even if the parties had shared the same information with the feds. The witnesses just couldn't say whether they shared that information with the government or what they learned from federal investigators.
 “The feds say we can ask our own questions as long as we don't ask 'Did you tell the feds XYZ?’” is how one Republican put it.
 So, I assume the Republicans could ask Speaker Madigan if he ever tried to get anyone appointed to ComEd's board of directors, or if he was aware of anyone in his ward applying for a ComEd internship program, or if he knew that people were being hired on contract with ComEd's money to do no-show jobs (the DPA alleges that all this and more was done to secure the powerful Madigan's favor). But would he answer the questions or even appear?
 “If the GOP's objective is to get Madigan sitting in front of them unable to answer questions, then they won that one,” said one attorney close to the House Democrats. “If the objective is to actually do an investigation, then they lost.”
 We'll see.
 In the meantime, Welch set the next hearing for September 29 in Springfield. He also said he sent letters requesting testimony from Speaker Madigan and everyone on the House Republicans' witness list.

UAE's Norwegian sprinter Alexander Kristoff won the first stage but after that they rode in the shadow of Roglic and Jumbo-Visma.
 Jumbo's stellar squad, which included former Giro d'Italia winner Tom Dumoulin, German veteran Tony Martin and Strade Bianche champion Wout Van Aert, controlled the peloton like a swarm of bees in their yellow and black livery. They finished with four riders in the top 20 of the overall standings.
 Behind Pogacar, who was making just his second Grand Tour appearance after winning three stages at last year's Vuelta a Espana, UAE's next best finisher was fellow Slovenian Jan Polanc in 40th. Fabio Aru, who with six stage wins was the team's most successful rider in major tours, dropped out on stage nine. That stage ended with Pogacar winning to leap from ninth to second as Roglic took the overall lead.
 Jumbo were repeating the formula used by Team Ineos, formerly Sky, most recently last year when Egan Bernal, at just 22, won with the support of 2018 Tour winner Geraint Thomas, experienced Jonathan Castroviejo and highly- respected Luke Rowe.
 Riding with weaker support, Pogacar clung to Roglic and the Jumbo swarm until the time came to race alone on the time trial. Then he pounced on the ride up La Planche des Belles Filles to climb to the summit of cycling.
 In celebration, the world's tallest building, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, was lit up late on Sunday with the image of Pogacar wearing his historical yellow jersey.
 On Monday, after three relentless weeks in the saddle, he could enjoy his birthday cake.
