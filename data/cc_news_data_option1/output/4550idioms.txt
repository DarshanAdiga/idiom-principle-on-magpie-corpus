 “In normal circumstances we would be preparing very soon to travel out to the location in Mallorca to get the villa ready but clearly that’s now out of the question.
 “We are very sorry for fans of the show but making it safely is our prime concern and Love Island will be back stronger than ever in 2021. In the meantime Love Island fans can still enjoy all six series of Love Island on BritBox.”

As have opportunists even further to the right, exploiting the vacuum of interest in the immiseration of the working class under neoliberalism from nominal progressives to feed them scapegoats and paranoid, totalitarian conspiratorial poison. In the face of these developments, identity reductionist liberal capitalists continue to turn a blind eye to the oppressiveness and injustice of class hierarchies _per se_ , with all that follows in willing blindness to the consequences. Leaving the door open for every far right demagogue to come piling in (which they do), liberal capitalists still have the gall to act surprised when the working class doesn't support them at the ballot box. They should perhaps not. As the experience of the Republicans under Trump and the far right his administration has emboldened suggests, the abandonment by liberal capitalists of class politics, and the working class along with it, is the seed of the rot of fascism.

On Tuesday, Montana voters gave the GOP unified control of state government, electing a Republican to the governor’s office for the first time in 16 years, Republican candidates to all statewide offices, and expanding GOP majorities in the state House and Senate.
 Even so, while at least one written policy agenda draft has been circulating in Republican circles, the party’s legislative leaders say they’re still working to define the priorities the party will bring to the Capitol when lawmakers meet this winter to craft a budget and debate changes to state law.
 “We’re very early in,” said Rep. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, last session’s Speaker Pro Tem, who was re-elected Tuesday. “I think we’ve got a lot of just nuts and bolts to get through before we can really start crafting some hard policy stuff in which direction we want to go to in this first session.”

 Collier Township has come a long way, and the housing developments, thriving businesses and busy roadways stand in stark contrast to the way the area looked back in the late 1880s. Who founded this community, and how did it get to where it is today? Three writers with roots in the region are about to print their third book on Collier’s history and its “forgotten people.”
 In 2018, cousins Rand Gee and Gene Czambel wrote “Forgotten Mines and Coal Towns of Thoms Run Road, 1880-1940.” Their great-grandfather, Edward Webster, built the Hotel Hickman in 1884 and started the town of Hickman on Thoms Run Road. The book is a history of the coal era on Thoms Run Road, where more than half the mines in Collier Township were located. Another cousin, Debbie Pelkey of McDonald, came on board for the second book last spring titled “Forgotten People of Collier Township, 1880-1940,” which focuses on the many people who built the township into the community it is today.

Australia's decision to take part in Malabar Exercise has outraged China, who has warned Canberra of "economic pain" if it continues to be part of US administration "roughneck gang".
 In an editorial piece, Communist party mouthpiece China Daily chided the Australian government for 'aggressively sending warships to China's doorsteps' as part of Exercise Malabar, UK Daily Mail reported.
 The first phase of the Malabar naval exercise has culminated recently in the Bay of Bengal with the participation by Indian Navy, United States Navy, Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force, and Royal Australian Navy.
 The 24th multinational maritime naval exercise, which started on November 3, was restricted to sea phase and conducted in "zero contact" format considering Covid-19 pandemic.
 "Although Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has declared that his government's approach to foreign policy is defined by 'strategic patience and consistency', particularly regarding China, his government's rash participation in the US administration's attempts to contain China belies that," the editorial said.
 "Canberra should realize it will get nothing from Washington in return for its collusion in its schemes, while Australia will pay tremendously for its misjudgment," it added.
 Chinese and Australian relations have deteriorated after Canberra called in April for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus without first consulting Beijing.
 Beijing has since imposed a large anti-dumping duty on Australian barley, banned beef exports from five abattoirs and instigated anti-dumping and subsidy investigations into cheap Australian wine in China.
 Another Chinese state media outlet, the Global Times recently warned Australia will pay an 'unbearable price' for 'sabotaging' bilateral relations and criticising the regime post-Covid.
 Recently, it was reported that importers across Beijing are expected to brace for a possible round of sanctions on copper ore and copper concentrate as well as sugar this week.
 The General Administration of Customs of China (GACC), last week, issued a notice to exporters claiming that it had found a pest in imported log timber from Queensland and has banned all log exports from the Australian state.
 The Chinese customs agency further claimed that it had found contamination in barley shipments from Australian grain exporter Emerald Grain as well.
 The propaganda publication accused Australia of prejudicially fueling anti- China sentiment and baselessly sanctioning Chinese companies, such as Huawei, who were shut out of the national 5G infrastructure grid on the grounds of national security.
 It also warned Canberra to 'steer clear of Washington's brinkmanship with China before it is too late'.

 And then, you voted. You delivered a clear message.
 You chose hope, unity, decency, science, and, yes, truth.
 You chose Joe Biden as the next President of the United States of America.
 Joe is a healer. A uniter. A tested and steady hand.
 A person whose own experience of loss gives him a sense of purpose that will help us, as a nation, reclaim our own sense of purpose.
 And a man with a big heart who loves with abandon.
 It’s his love for Jill, who will be an incredible First Lady.
 It’s his love for Hunter, Ashley, his grandchildren, and the entire Biden family.
 And while I first knew Joe as vice-president, I really got to know him as the father who loved Beau, my dear friend, who we remember here today.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said Sunday that ties between Kabul and Washington are expected to deepen in areas of counter-terrorism and building peace as he congratulated Joe Biden on his election victory.
 "Afghanistan looks forward to continuing/deepening our multilayered strategic partnership w/ the United States -- our foundational partner -- including in counterterrorism & bringing peace to Afghanistan," Ghani wrote on Twitter.
 Biden's victory was also welcomed by ordinary citizens, who thought he might slow what some see as a too-hasty withdrawal of US troops.
 US President Donald Trump's administration signed a deal with the Taliban on February 29 that agreed to withdraw all American forces from Afghanistan by May 2021.
 "Biden will also finish the war, but he wants to bring the war to a responsible end, not rushing like Trump," said Mohammad Dawood, a garment seller in Kabul.
 "He will slow down the withdrawal from Afghanistan and will keep some troops here, which is good news."
 The withdrawal of troops has been a cornerstone of Trump's plans to end America's longest war.
 His administration agreed to fully disengage in exchange for a commitment from the Taliban to stop trans-national jihadist groups such as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State from operating in Afghanistan.
 The US military has already shut several bases across the country and pulled out thousands of troops as agreed.
 Timor Sharan, a lecturer at the American University in Afghanistan, said on Twitter that the incoming Biden administration will have a "more tolerant" approach to peace talks, as Washington's deal with the Taliban was "terrible" and gave no leverage to the government.
 That excluded the Afghan government from negotiations, however, and also saw almost 6,000 Taliban prisoners released -- much to the displeasure of authorities.
 Days after the release of prisoners, peace talks between the Taliban and Afghan government to end the war were launched in the Qatari capital.
 The talks, which commenced on September 12, have failed to make any significant progress so far.
 Violence, however, has surged across the country, including in Kabul, with the Taliban stepping up daily attacks against Afghan security forces.
 Scores of people were killed in two attacks in the capital targeting educational institutions within days of each other.
 Both attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group, but officials have blamed the Taliban.
 "Joe Biden's election as president is good news for Afghanistan," said Ahmad Jawed, a university student in Kabul.
 "I think he will not repeat mistakes committed by Trump. I think Biden will even reconsider the US-Taliban deal and then somehow keep some troops in Afghanistan."

Pakistan's pace legend and former captain Wasim Akram has backed white-ball skipper Babar Azam to also take over Test captaincy from the tour of New Zealand and urged him to be more assertive. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is expected to announce a new Test captain on November 11 to replace Azhar Ali, who will however remain a part of the 35-member jumbo squad for the New Zealand tour, where the national team will play two Tests and three T20 Internationals.
 "You ask me as a former player, yes, I back Babar to become Test captain because he is our future and he can continue for a long time," Akram said on YouTube channel 'Cricket Baaz'.
 "If the PCB appoints him they should for a proper time so that at least there is no confusion as to who is in charge in the dressing room."
 One of the game's greatest fast bowlers, Akram has also led the national team during his glorious international career, which included a World Cup triumph and plenty of individual accolades. "I back Babar because I don't want to see those days when I was playing and there were around four to five captains in our dressing room.
 "He is our best player and people who say that making him Test captain will affect his batting, don't buy that because he is a batsman and it is his job to score runs. "Aren't Virat Kohli or Kane Williamson also captains and top batsmen," the former fast bowling great asked.
 Akram said that the experiment to make Misbah-ul-Haq head coach and chief selector has not worked as Pakistan cricket has not seen any improvement in recent times. "At times I get the feeling they are still stuck in the 90s mindset. I get the feeling, at times, some are only playing for their runs. This doesn't work anymore and you just need to look at other teams to realise this."
 He said Pakistan cricket badly needed consistency in selection and continuity in captaincy. He also advised Babar to take more control as captain and implement his decisions. "He has to get rid of this feeling in the social media that it is Misbah who is taking all the decisions behind the scenes.
 "I see Babar as the best choice because I am optimistic that in time he will learn a lot, he is a good learner, he will improve and he will become a good captain and leader and we should have stability in captaincy when the 2023 World Cup is held.
 "Even when I came into cricket I took years to change my personality and groom myself. Babar will also groom himself."
 Akram also said that he didn't believe that to be captain it was necessary for Babar to speak English. "There is no shame if he converses in Urdu, he should be good at conversing in Urdu."
 Akram said that Babar will learn to express himself better and interact confidently with the media and other people as captain in a few months' time. "I have always supported the policy of having someone young as captain because it ensures he will serve for at least five to six years time.
 "When South Africa appointed Graeme Smith as captain after the 2003 World Cup he was, I think, only 22 and look where he went." Akram also didn't agree with suggestions to make Mohammad Rizwan the captain or vice-captain.
 "Look how many matches has he played? I know he will be upset with me for saying this but he has to first establish himself in the team to be considered as a candidate." Asked about his role in the PCB's cricket committee, Akram bluntly said it was serving no purpose.
 "First of all cricket committee, we haven't had a meeting for a long time now except for a brief meeting before COVID-19. No one has called or invited us. There is no use for it. I don't know why I am there because there is no point in me being there because nothing is happening."

The last game before the final will be played on Sunday. The virtual semi-final will see Sunrisers Hyderabad take on the Delhi Capitals for a chance to qualify for the final of the Indian Premier League 2020. With the season almost coming to an end, both DC and SRH lock horns at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium looking for a chance to have a crack at the title. Delhi Capitals will be hoping to reach their first-ever IPL final while SRH will look to play their second one in three years. Before the start of the pivotal game, former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar talked about the match. Bangar maintained for both teams two players will play an important role in their success. For DC, Bangar said that Dhawan will be the main player as he knows SRH in and out. READ| 'To gift him to one of the strongest teams, is extraordinary,' Tom Moody not happy with DC's decision to trade Trent Boult to MI"He's a big match player, ….World Cup, ICC Championship, whenever he is required he has always fired for the team, which he has played for. He knows what is the state, he knows the SunRisers Hyderabad in and out, because he has played for them, he knows how to tackle Rashid Khan and he goes after him. So, I believe, Shikhar Dhawan is going to be a brilliant brilliant player, if Delhi Capitals have to win this game," Bangar said on Star Sports' show Game Plan.While for Hyderabad, Bangar feels that Kane Williamson will be crucial if they intend to continue their winning run in IPL 2020."He's gone be equally important for SunRisers Hyderabad….how a David Warner is important right at the top, but you saw in the previous game, his temperament, the ability to soak-in pressure and then put the pressure back on the opponent is a crucial quality, which not many people have. So, I believe, he's going to be a crucial element, if SRH have to continue their march of winning five games in a row. So, he is going to be critical."DC take on SRH in the Qualifier 2 on Sunday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. The winner will play Mumbai Indians in the final.

If you were to take a walk around Rotary Park in the mornings, you’ll most likely see a group of elderly folks playing a pickup softball game on one of the fields. These softballers are part of the Havasu Senior Softball League, which includes members who are 50 years of age and older.
 The league has been around for approximately 30 years and one of its longtime members, David Moore, has been involved with league for 22 years since he moved to Lake Havasu City. Moore plays catcher in the league and serves as the public information officer of Havasu Senior Softball.
 “It gives us something to do,” Moore said. “We’re retired, so it gives us something to do and these guys love to play ball. We’re not all good, some are very good, but everybody gets to play. Everybody has a good time and we enjoy being out here even in the summer time.”
 The league plays throughout the year, but for eight weeks from January to February, the league plays with at least six teams with numerous winter visitors joining in the fun. Each game is nine innings.
 The league is always looking for new players women are also welcomed to join. The league currently has only has one woman playing. Havasu Senior Softball also operates batting cages at SARA Park as a 501(c) non-profit organization, which will open on Nov.14.
 The youngest member is 52 while the oldest is 88. Members are either retired or semi-retired and have worked in various occupations such as ministers, firemen, policemen, and as an Air Force general.
 Moore said the league has about 25 to 30 local residents play throughout the year and during a normal winter that number increases to approximately 80.
 “With that, we’re able to have six teams and play our league,” Moore said. “This year we might only have four of five teams because a lot of the winter visitors even from the Midwest aren’t coming out or from Washington or Oregon.”
 Moore doesn’t expect many winter visitors as usual this year, especially those from Canada, because of the covid-19 pandemic.
 League president Tom Stark said they had had shut down the league for 8 to 9 weeks due the city’s covid-19 regulations. Stark also expects to have less members and fewer teams this winter.
 Moore said there hasn’t been one member infected with the coronavirus from playing in a game, but one person did contract the virus at a hospital and that person has recovered.
 “We had to implement some guidelines like no after-game handshakes and minor things to keep some social distancing in mind and to keep everybody safe,” Stark said. “It is a high-risk group being a senior league. It’s an over-50 league so we had to implement things and there’s a National Senior Softball Association and they put out some recommendations on guidelines and we followed some of those.”
 Stark, who usually plays in the outfield, is currently serving his first year as president of Havasu Senior Softball and has been affiliated with the league since he moved to Havasu. Stark moved to Havasu from Torrance three years ago. The league also has seven board members and each team has at one member of the board on their team. The board members are elected from within the league.
 Pickup games usually take place at Rotary Park on Mondays and Thursday at 9:30 a.m. and are free. For those who are interested in joining this winter, there’s a $50 fee and the deadline to join is Nov. 30. To join you could contact Moore through phone either at 928-855-2727 or 928-706-0164.
 “It’s a lot of fun,” Stark said. “We usually go out and have a burger after the game and there’s a lot of friendships that are created. It was a great way to get acquainted with the community and meet people in the community and get involved.”

On May 4, 1926, Thomas Gaetano DiLorenzo was born in Bristol, Pa. as the seventh child to Gaetano DiLorenzo and Maria Giuseppina (Ferrelli) DiLorenzo, both were immigrants from Capracotta, Abruzzo, Italy. On Thursday, Oct. 22, 2020, Tom passed on at age 94 to meet his loving wife, Ellen (Patterson) DiLorenzo, who predeceased Tom on Sept. 24, 2001. Those of us who knew and loved Tom believed he wanted to be with Ellen on her birthday of October 23rd.      Thomas DiLorenzo was the last of his generation and he will be sorely missed by those he leaves behind. His six siblings, Carmella Esposito, Pasquale DiLorenzo, Edith LaCava, Daniel DiLorenzo, Julia Bergfield and Yolanda Conti, all predeceased him.      At age 18 in 1944, Tom joined the U.S Army Air Corps, served for six years and earned the World War II Victory Medal and Good Conduct Medal. Upon completion of his initial service, he re-enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1950 and served another three years and four months, being honorably discharged at age 27 in May of 1953 as a Staff Sergeant. His military service included over two years serving abroad, as well as service in Louisiana, Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska.      After his military service, Tom went to work for General Electric and while with GE, he met the love of his life, Ellen Patterson. Tom and Ellen were married at St. Mark's Church in Bristol on May 17, 1958. His nephew, Dr. Pasquale DiLorenzo, served as his best man, and over 350 of his large family joined Tom and Ellen for a traditional raucous "Italian Wedding" at the American Legion Hall on Pond Street in Bristol.      Tom and Ellen settled into a home at 310 Jefferson Ave., where they lived happily while Tom started his new business, Thomas DiLorenzo's Refrigeration Company, after "retiring" from GE. Tom could never sit still. He was one of those neighbors everyone wanted nearby because he was always eager to help. His garage was converted into a tool shed, where Tom had every tool imaginable. He worked constantly on his inventions, and although his family didn't realize it at the time, and thought he was just "tinkering," he truly was an impressive inventor. Tom holds two issued U.S. Patents, which he invented while servicing ice machines and refrigeration equipment in restaurants through his Refrigeration Company. Tom noticed that most restaurants had mold and mildew growing in their ice machines and beverage dispensers, and consequently, loads of bacteria. He came up with methods of introducing ozone into the water supply and air supply of the ice and beverage machines, and held U.S. Patent Nos. 2007016, and 2007021 "Ice Making and Dispensing Method and Apparatus with Increased Sanitation."      Tom is also listed as a co-inventor on U.S. Patent Application No. 2011015 "Air Removal Chamber for a Cell Expansion System and Method of Use Associated Therewith," Co-Inventor of U.S. Patent Application No. 2012008 "Methods and Systems of Growing and Harvesting Cells in a Hollow Fiber Bioreactor System with Control Conditions," Co-Inventor of U.S. Patent Application Nos. 2011015 "Air Removal Chamber for a Cell Expansion System and Method of Use Associated Therewith," and Co-Inventor of U.S. Patent Application Nos. 8399245 and 2013015 "Rotation System for Cell Growth Chamber."      Tom and Ellen did not have children, but they were aunt and uncle to nieces and nephews, all of whom became their "children," including Carmen Esposito, Pasquale DiLorenzo, Rosemarie DiLorenzo Puchino, Louis Thomas Conti, Dr. Thomas G. Bergfield, Dan DiLorenzo, Karen DiLorenzo-Thames, Maria Conti Tuohy, Robert Esposito and Richard Esposito from Tom's side of the family; and Eileen Miller, Pauline Sohenuick, Marlene Ridge (deceased), Martin Ridge, Patrick Ridge, Robert Ridge, James Sohenuick and Jennifer Sohenuick from Ellen's side of the family.      Tom was very close to the aunts, uncles, and cousins in the Deon and Ferrelli families spread throughout Bucks County, Pa. and Burlington County, N.J., including his first cousins from those families: Charles Deon, Pat Deon, Anna Deon Bakelar, Carrie Deon, Lillian Deon Cocci, Frank Deon, Pat Ferrelli, Dominick Ferrelli, Tony Ferrelli, Joe Ferrelli, Daniel Ferrelli, Edith Ferrelli Sodano, and Maggie Ferrelli Marter. Through the years, the DiLorenzo, Deon, and Ferrelli families would celebrate most family gatherings at the home of Edith, Hank, Frank and Fran Sodano in Penndel, with its mature fruit trees, large inground swimming pool, and wide open field for horseshoe tossing, bocce ball, softball, football, or soccer games. Tom would be the "never stop" worker at these gatherings, always doing everything he could to help other members of the family, no matter how busy he was at home or in his refrigeration business.      Later in life, Tom made plans to move to Denver, Colo. to be with the huge families which had grown from his nephew and niece, transplanted Bristolians, Dr. Pasquale "Pat" DiLorenzo, and his sister, Rosemarie DiLorenzo Puchino. Pat and his lovely wife, Janet "Jan," settled in Denver after Creighton University Medical School and residency in Hawaii; they had five children, Pasquale Jr., Gregory, Thomas, David, and Francis "Fran." Coincidentally Rosemarie and Michael Puchino followed Pat and Jan to Denver, and also had five children, Maryjo Puchino Conkey, Michael, Pasquale, Victor, and Thomas. As of today there are over 50 family descendants as part of the "Colorado clan." Regretfully, Tom never made it to live with Rosemarie and Michael Puchino in Denver to be part of the Colorado clan.      It isn't easy to summarize Thomas DiLorenzo, but he was one of those few who gave, and gave more, and never asked for anything in return. He was scrupulously honest, caring, moral, and always available for anyone who needed help. He loved and respected everyone, and all who came to know Tom felt the same about him.      Tom was a man who, as President Abraham Lincoln said so eloquently, "listened to the better angels of our nature," every day of his life. He will be missed terribly by all of us.      A burial will be conducted by Molden Funeral Home at 12 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 11, and a celebration of his life with family and friends will be held in the Spring.      One of our Uncle's lifelong missions was to honor his fellow military members by donating to various organizations that assisted the military men and women that needed assistance entering back into civilian life. In lieu of flowers, Mass Cards and the like, please consider honoring Uncle Tom's last wishes by a contribution to Fisher House, 12300 Twinbrook Parkway, Suite 410, Rockville MD 20852 - fisherhouse.org, or Fidelco Guide Dogs Foundation, Inc., 103 Vision Way, Bloomfield, CT 06002 - fidelco.org/donate.

By ANITA SNOW, DAVID GOLDMAN and LISA MARIE PANE Associated Press      Chanting "This isn't over!" and "Stop the steal," supporters of President Donald Trump protested at state capitols across the country Saturday, refusing to accept defeat and echoing Trump's unsubstantiated allegations that the Democrats won by fraud.   From Atlanta and Tallahassee to Austin, Bismarck, Boise and Phoenix, crowds ranging in size from a few dozen to a few thousand — some of them openly carrying guns — decried the news of Joe Biden's victory after more than three suspense-filled days of vote-counting put the Democrat over the top. Skirmishes broke out in some cities.      In Atlanta, outside the state Capitol in the longtime Republican stronghold of Georgia, chants of "Lock him up!" rang out among an estimated 1,000 Trump supporters. Others chanted, "This isn't over! This isn't over!" and "Fake news!" The streets were awash with American flags and Trump banners.   No immediate violence was reported, though at one point, police moved to separate Trump opponents from supporters. Biden held a slim lead in Georgia, which hasn't gone for a Democrat since 1992.   Jordan Kelley, a 29-year-old from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, drove three-plus hours to Atlanta to attend the pro-Trump rally.   "There's election fraud going on here," said Kelley, claiming that voters in Georgia, a state with a GOP governor and secretary of state, had improperly counted the ballots to put Biden ahead. "Even though I live in Tennessee, I'm an American, and I want to make sure Americans have a voice in the election."   He planned to make the 10-hour trip to Washington next week to demonstrate on the steps of the Supreme Court, where Trump and his lawyers have vowed to eventually make his case.      Underscoring the hard feelings on both sides of the nation's deep political divide, anti-Trump protesters in Washington booed, yelled obscenities, shouted "Loser! Loser!" and gave the finger to Trump's motorcade as the president returned to the White House from a golf outing Saturday.   Two signs posted in front of Trump's Washington hotel read "Don't be a sore loser" and "Face Reality."   For his part, Biden pleaded for unity and reconciliation in a televised address Saturday night, saying it is time for Americans to "put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature" and "stop treating our opponents like enemies."   "Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now," he said.   Contrary to the claims of Trump supporters, there has been no evidence of any serious vote fraud. And some Republican elected officials around the country began to distance themselves from Trump and urge him to accept the outcome gracefully.      The utter rejection of Biden as the legitimate president by Trump and his supporters appears to represent something new in American political history, said Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.   "We typically haven't had a leader who loses the presidency who then tells his followers, 'This is false. This has been stolen from us,'" Perry said. "Incumbent presidents have been mad, so mad they didn't go to the inauguration, but not like this, where they are leading those people to say this is fraudulent."   A couple of thousand Trump supporters gathered at the Pennsylvania Capitol in Harrisburg. Pennsylvania played a crucial role in Biden's victory.      "If we don't stop this today, it'll all be over," Bruce Fields, 66, said of news organizations declaring Biden the winner. "Otherwise we can kiss freedom goodbye."   About two dozen heavily armed men, some wearing camouflage, joined the rally.      At the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix, a crowd swelled to more than 1,000 within hours. Biden won Arizona on his way to victory in the Electoral College.   "It's very suspicious that President Trump, with the red wave we've been seeing in Arizona, is struggling," Kelli Ward, former state senator and chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party, told boisterous pro-Trump demonstrators. "I want to know if there is any discrepancy with the numbers coming out of the machines."   More than 1,000 people gathered at the Texas Capitol in Austin, with police keeping Trump and Biden supporters on opposite sides of the street. Several hundred demonstrators turned out in Salem, Oregon, for a "Stop the Steal" rally.   Even in a place that wasn't close, Trump supporters gathered in droves to express support for him and vent frustration over the outcome of the election. Outside North Dakota's Capitol in Bismarck, the state's all-Republican congressional delegation joined chanting, sign-carrying protesters.   A few skirmishes broke out between Trump backers and pro-Biden and Black Lives Matters demonstrators, with one BLM supporter attempting to handcuff himself to a Trump supporter. The two men began wrestling on the ground.   An officer escorted the Black Lives Matter supporter to a squad car. It was unclear if he had been arrested.      In Lansing, Michigan, about 50 Trump supporters and a smaller group of marchers carrying Black Lives Matter flags converged on the state Capitol, where they pushed, shoved and shouted at one another in a tense standoff. But within moments of the race being called, a few from both sides broke into prayer, and at least one pair hugged.   Frank Dobbs, 40, of Henderson, Nevada, brought a bullhorn and a Trump 2020 flag that he wrestled with in a stiff wind during a rally outside the Clark County registrar of voters office in North Las Vegas.      "It's not over until it's over. There's still the courts. If ever there's ever a time to expose widespread fraud, this is the president to do it," Dobbs said. "The media doesn't decide who wins the presidency. The legal voters of this country decide."

On Sunday, Grenier will mark her 20th year working at the HRDC. During her tenure, Bozeman has gone through massive changes — most notably, the population boom that is likely to put Bozeman over the 50,000 mark once the 2020 Census is wrapped up.
 Those changes haven’t come without growing pains, many of which Grenier and the HRDC work to address, like housing and food insecurity. Those issues have all become more complicated over the last two decades, but the growth isn’t all doom and gloom, Grenier said.
 “It really is a big hill we have to climb, but the growth is also bringing in new partners and new people who can help work on a lot of those community issues too,” she said. “There’s nothing that we, as an organization, have done in the last 20 years that we’ve done independently. It’s always been with the partnership of many other people.”

As the radical historian Rudolf Rocker noted in the years prior to WWII, the promise of equality before the law under liberal democracy was shipwrecked on the rocks of class society, a fact that has only become truer in the post-war period, as the United States acted as midwife for the rise to power of a transnational corporate empire in the midst of its own rise to global dominance as geopolitical hegemon. With the rise of transnational corporate capitalism, the limitations of liberal capitalism are becoming too conspicuous to safely sweep under the rug. Politicians are bought and paid for before they even reach office thanks to corporate campaign donations, as are the national committees of two-party duopolies, and this is only the beginning.

From its beginnings out of the European Enlightenment, liberal capitalism was based on a promise of progress through justice predicated on equality before the law. In light of the fact that the Enlightenment ran alongside the European Witch Hunts, the ideological foundations of liberal capitalism have always been something of a thought experiment, since the political democracy of liberal capitalism has tended to turn a blind eye to the class war characteristic of the Witch Hunts. This is doubly true of the class war of societies dominated by class hierarchies, such as every society that a liberal democracy has ever operated within. The fact that the Enlightenment did take place alongside the Witch Hunts might perhaps be considered indicative of a pronounced cognitive dissonance; the failure amongst liberal capitalists to perceive any could likewise be considered telling.

Australia's decision to take part in Malabar Exercise has outraged China, who has warned Canberra of "economic pain" if it continues to be part of US administration "roughneck gang".In an editorial piece, Communist party mouthpiece China Daily chided the Australian government for 'aggressively sending warships to China's doorsteps' as part of Exercise Malabar, UK Daily Mail reported.The first phase of the Malabar naval exercise has culminated recently in the Bay of Bengal with the participation by Indian Navy, United States Navy, Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force, and Royal Australian Navy.The 24th multinational maritime naval exercise, which started on November 3, was restricted to sea phase and conducted in "zero contact" format considering Covid-19 pandemic."Although Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has declared that his government's approach to foreign policy is defined by 'strategic patience and consistency', particularly regarding China, his government's rash participation in the US administration's attempts to contain China belies that," the editorial said."Canberra should realize it will get nothing from Washington in return for its collusion in its schemes, while Australia will pay tremendously for its misjudgment," it added.Chinese and Australian relations have deteriorated after Canberra called in April for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus without first consulting Beijing.Beijing has since imposed a large anti-dumping duty on Australian barley, banned beef exports from five abattoirs and instigated anti-dumping and subsidy investigations into cheap Australian wine in China.Another Chinese state media outlet, the Global Times recently warned Australia will pay an 'unbearable price' for 'sabotaging' bilateral relations and criticising the regime post-Covid.Recently, it was reported that importers across Beijing are expected to brace for a possible round of sanctions on copper ore and copper concentrate as well as sugar this week.The General Administration of Customs of China (GACC), last week, issued a notice to exporters claiming that it had found a pest in imported log timber from Queensland and has banned all log exports from the Australian state.The Chinese customs agency further claimed that it had found contamination in barley shipments from Australian grain exporter Emerald Grain as well.The propaganda publication accused Australia of prejudicially fueling anti-China sentiment and baselessly sanctioning Chinese companies, such as Huawei, who were shut out of the national 5G infrastructure grid on the grounds of national security.It also warned Canberra to 'steer clear of Washington's brinkmanship with China before it is too late'.

For more than 30 years Plymouth South athletic trainer Carol Petrell has made sure that high school athletes in Plymouth always get the best care when they need an ankle taped or a bump on the head checked out.
 "I'm there to help out the coaches the best that I can. Being an athletic trainer is still fun for me. I love being around the teams and helping the kids," this week's 50-for-50 profile said. "You never want to see an injury happen, but I want to be there to help out if something should pop up."
 The 56-year-old joked that she was "a child of double-sessions" while attending Plymouth-Carver in the early-1980s, sometimes practicing in the morning with the rest of the underclassmen while some of their teammates were in classes. During that time there were also many Saturdays spent back at the high school playing games.
 "I loved playing sports, so it got to be kind of natural for me. That's just the way things were back then," Carol said. "Because of double-sessions some of us were practicing in the morning and some others were in the afternoon, but we did our best to make it all work."
 She played three seasons each with the basketball and softball programs at P-C. Petrell usually took the fall season off from sports but made an exception for her senior year when she was part of something historic.
 In the fall of 1980, Athletic Director Henry Cryer approached boys JV soccer coach Dennis Azevedo with a proposition. Cryer had a goal of beginning the town's first high school girls soccer program and he wanted Azevedo to coach the team.
 Azevedo accepted the offer of leading the brand new team in 1981. And soon enough Carol was on board with him.
 "I was at a basketball camp during the summer before that first season and a couple of girls said they were going to go out for the team. They wanted me to join the team with them, and I told them the only way I would do it is if I got to play goalie, because I'd be able to use my hands," Carol said.
 A deal was struck and Carol became one of the 44 players who were part of Plymouth's first girls soccer team. She won the starting goaltender spot and was elected a team captain along with Karen Reinhart and Patty Heanue.
 "That season was a blast," she remembered. "I have a competitive edge to me, and the chance to be a part of something new was really exciting to me."
 Azevedo agrees with Carol's assessment of her competitive nature.
 "I've known Carol over the years on a lot of levels. As a student, a player on my team, as a colleague and now as a personal friend," said Azevedo, who is the godfather to Carol's daughter Meghan. "One thing I can tell you is that she's always had a competitive streak to her, no matter what she is doing."
 As Carol was getting ready to leave Plymouth-Carver with the Class of 1982 she took some advice from her old coach about exploring the possibility of athletic training. Carol followed that road, graduating from Bridgewater State in 1989 with a Physical Education degree and a certification in athletic training.
 "I saw Carole's work ethic and her love of athletics, and I thought that a career in something like athletic training would be a great way for her to stay connected to the game. I thought she'd really take to the profession," Dennis said.
 They say timing is everything. At the same time Carol was leaving college in 1989, Dr. R. Scott Oliver was working on a project to get an athletic trainer into the local school systems. Carol took the spot and she worked for Rocky Gomes and Cryer in both Carver and Plymouth that first year before focusing just on the Plymouth schools starting in 1990.
 Carol's also worked full-time as a physical education teacher at Norwell Middle School for the last 20 years, starting her day at that school before heading back to Plymouth for any afternoon or night games.
 "My two daughters (Katelyn and Meghan) pretty much grew up on the sideline at Plymouth North," Carol said. "It was great working with the athletes each day and having my two kids right there with me."
 When Meghan (Class of 2010) and Katelyn ('12) got to Plymouth North they were both starting defenders on the school's varsity girls lacrosse team during Meghan's senior season. Carol stepped away from her athletic training duties that year so she could watch her two daughters play together.
 "That chance wasn't going to happen again, and I didn't want to miss the opportunity. Watching them play together is my fondest memory from all my years of being around Plymouth sports," Carol said. "Time goes by quickly, and I really felt like I needed to be there to support the both of them and enjoy the moment."
 She wasn't out of the game for long, through. Carol would soon come back to be the athletic trainer for Plymouth South, and she's still there today, ready to lend a hand wherever she's needed.
 "Carol has been a great ally for all the coaches and athletes over the years," Plymouth South Head Coach Scott Fry said. "When I was the head football coach I always knew my players were in good hands when Carol was working with them."
 Fry added, "She has a great way of forming strong relationships with kids, and they respond to her because she tells them the truth. It's amazing how many athletes come home from college and stop by the high school just to say hello and check in with Carol. It's a great thing to see."
 Carol said she was pleased to see how the role of an athletic trainer has changed over the years.
 "The need has always been there to have an athletic trainer around to help out with the athletes, and I think the town of Plymouth has done a great job of protecting its athletes over the years. Schools have come a long way over the years to get to the system we have in place now," Carol said. "There is very good communication between trainers. If something happens at an away game I'll usually get a message telling me to look out for something if one our athletes had an issue."
 Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

 "I am a woman of my word in life and in business and I've drained my own savings to ensure that I can pay my staff and make up the furlough money for them and keep them in work.
 "I'm a working, single mum and I'll keep supporting my staff for as long as I can but I can't do it forever, however much I want to.
 "I've always prided myself on being able to create work for people in the community, for mums who need flexible shifts and employment. I will be doing everything in my power to keep to my word. Since the pandemic, when we have opened we haven't made money but I was doing it to make sure I created some work, that I gave a bit of hope and normality to our staff. We're like a family.
 "But I lay awake at night and I can't sleep. All I have on my mind is my staff, The Sandon and how we can make this work. I'm struggling for answers. It isn't just about the money, it's about the people that are affected by this."

Pakistan's pace legend and former captain Wasim Akram has backed white-ball skipper Babar Azam to also take over Test captaincy from the tour of New Zealand and urged him to be more assertive. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is expected to announce a new Test captain on November 11 to replace Azhar Ali, who will however remain a part of the 35-member jumbo squad for the New Zealand tour, where the national team will play two Tests and three T20 Internationals."You ask me as a former player, yes, I back Babar to become Test captain because he is our future and he can continue for a long time," Akram said on YouTube channel 'Cricket Baaz'."If the PCB appoints him they should for a proper time so that at least there is no confusion as to who is in charge in the dressing room." One of the game's greatest fast bowlers, Akram has also led the national team during his glorious international career, which included a World Cup triumph and plenty of individual accolades. "I back Babar because I don't want to see those days when I was playing and there were around four to five captains in our dressing room. "He is our best player and people who say that making him Test captain will affect his batting, don't buy that because he is a batsman and it is his job to score runs. "Aren't Virat Kohli or Kane Williamson also captains and top batsmen," the former fast bowling great asked.Akram said that the experiment to make Misbah-ul-Haq head coach and chief selector has not worked as Pakistan cricket has not seen any improvement in recent times. "At times I get the feeling they are still stuck in the 90s mindset. I get the feeling, at times, some are only playing for their runs. This doesn't work anymore and you just need to look at other teams to realise this." He said Pakistan cricket badly needed consistency in selection and continuity in captaincy. He also advised Babar to take more control as captain and implement his decisions. "He has to get rid of this feeling in the social media that it is Misbah who is taking all the decisions behind the scenes."I see Babar as the best choice because I am optimistic that in time he will learn a lot, he is a good learner, he will improve and he will become a good captain and leader and we should have stability in captaincy when the 2023 World Cup is held. "Even when I came into cricket I took years to change my personality and groom myself. Babar will also groom himself." Akram also said that he didn't believe that to be captain it was necessary for Babar to speak English. "There is no shame if he converses in Urdu, he should be good at conversing in Urdu." Akram said that Babar will learn to express himself better and interact confidently with the media and other people as captain in a few months' time. "I have always supported the policy of having someone young as captain because it ensures he will serve for at least five to six years time. "When South Africa appointed Graeme Smith as captain after the 2003 World Cup he was, I think, only 22 and look where he went." Akram also didn't agree with suggestions to make Mohammad Rizwan the captain or vice- captain. "Look how many matches has he played? I know he will be upset with me for saying this but he has to first establish himself in the team to be considered as a candidate." Asked about his role in the PCB's cricket committee, Akram bluntly said it was serving no purpose."First of all cricket committee, we haven't had a meeting for a long time now except for a brief meeting before COVID-19. No one has called or invited us. There is no use for it. I don't know why I am there because there is no point in me being there because nothing is happening."

The White House will have a new occupant shortly. What does this mean for India? The Modi government's connection with President elect Joe Biden goes back to the days when External Affairs S. Jaishankar was Indian Ambassador to US during the Obama administration and present Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu was his deputy. The two have kept in touch with close advisors of President elect Biden ensuring that US maintains its bipartisan consensus towards India.As far as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is concerned, he runs foreign policy on a personal touch with Indian interests as a top priority. He only gives up on a country or an institution after the latter shows duplicity in bilateral relations. No marks for guessing the countries in that category.While the Indian foreign policy will indeed have to recalibrate its approach towards the incoming Biden administration, New Delhi knows that president-elect is a collegial guy, who was more approachable to Republican adversaries as a vice president than the president during the Obama years. A quintessential politician who stayed more than half his life in Washington and knows the wrangling at Capitol Hill.Unlike President Trump who hid his strategy behind a brash style, the incoming President will be more predictable in dealing with the world. He is expected to be tough yet not confrontational with China, will mend fences with Europe and be slightly rough with Russia. Even though the Chinese experts are gloating over President Trump's defeat, the US system now firmly believes that Beijing is not only an adversary but also a threat to future. So one should not expect bombastic statements against the Communist Party of China during Biden-era but US policy on China has turned full circle and there should be a build-up on the Asia pivot that was promised but not delivered in the Obama administration. Trump, on his part, may be down but not out and will campaign for the Senate run-offs in Georgia to remain politically relevant in Republican party.China's all weather ally Pakistan also heaving a sigh of relief at the exit of President Trump but New Delhi believes that incoming administration will be tough on terrorism, particularly after the recent Islamist attacks in Europe by migrants. The president-elect will continue with past policy of exiting from Afghanistan but that won't be easy as the US intelligence agencies and Pentagon (Trump dismissed their advice) have been reporting the escalation of Taliban violence with the backing of Haqqani network and Quetta based Shura with direct involvement of Pakistan deep state. As president-elect is expected to work with expert advice on Afghanistan, then the role of British, who are tied up with Pakistan, may diminish in the near future. Islamabad's double play in Afghanistan is now known to its former friends like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia with proof. Pakistan's problem in fact may multiply with president-elect Biden having a very poor opinion about Islamabad's newfound ally Turkey. Iran's belief that US sanctions may be lifted by incoming Biden administration's hitching back with Europe on nuclear deal with Tehran may come true as the new administration will move towards multilateralism, which was scorned by the present Trump administration. With the US expected to seek accommodation with Europe on global issues like Climate Change and health due to on-going pandemic, frayed ties with Germany will be on the mend. The US ties with Russia are expected to decline further under the incoming administration.While New Delhi will wait till January 2021 for formal engagement with the new administration, it appears most confident in dealing with the new occupant of the White House.

Harmony Homes has long been referred to as the “tiny homes” project, and had originally been sited at Maple Square, located at 2 E. Lodi Ave.
 Della Monica said the site did not pass muster after the city conducted several sound studies and found noise from the train would be disruptive to potential residents.
 The city had also considered placing the project at Chapman Field on North Washington Street as part of a proposed homeless “sanctuary” project that incorporated the Armory.
 Although the site had never been officially approved for the project, backlash from neighbors and youth sports leagues that utilize Chapman Field squashed any plans.
 Funds for the project come from a $1.25 million Homeless Emergency Aid Program grant, as well as a Permanent Local Housing Allocation grant.
 The homes will be pre-manufactured with one bedroom, and Della Monica said the city hopes to have them ordered by February. The project should be completed by September, he said.
 Once complete, Harmony Homes will be managed by the Housing Authority of San Joaquin.
 Della Monica said this is the first of many projects the city hopes to implement in an effort to provide affordable housing for residents.
 “We are very hopeful of continuing our efforts to provide assisted living,” he said. “We are going to be working as a community on affordable housing. We are dramatically short on what is required of us as a municipality, so we are making great efforts to plan for that, to work into our development standards and reach those goals”
 The city is inviting the Lodi community to provide feedback through an online survey at www.lodi.gov/1013, and to virtually attend the Lodi Improvement Committee meeting at 6 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 10 at www.lodi.gov/agendacenter. The project will be considered by the Lodi City Council at its Dec. 2 meeting.

“I’m very excited to get back to the state tournament,” Birch said. “I think we can do very well and I’m excited to get a good seed. It would be amazing to win another state title, especially since we played a lot less games this year.”
 Earlier in the regular season, the two teams met with Woodrow earning a hard fought 2-1 victory on October 21, one of only three losses on the season for GW. It was all Patriots, though, in the rematch on Saturday in the Regional Final.
 In the first set, both teams went back and forth early on. GW led 20-15 when Woodrow battled back and cut the lead to just two at 23-21. A Birch successful block gave the Patriots a point, and then they closed it out with a 25-21 victory to take a 1-0 lead.
 The key second set came down to the wire with the Flying Eagles holding onto a slim 21-19 lead looking to even the match at 1-1. GW, though, would score the next five points to lead 24-21, one point away from victory.
 Woodrow got a point back but once again, Birch made a big play for the Patriots. The senior hit a winner to close out the second set 25-22, and give GW a commanding 2-0 lead over the Flying Eagles.
 “I was just excited, I wanted to kill it so bad and win it for the team,” Birch said. “It was a big difference going up 2-0. We wanted to come out strong, and we did. We just needed to calm down. We didn’t have much pressure on us at that point. We just wanted to take it point by point.”
 With all the pressure off, the Patriots jumped out to a 5-1 lead early on in the third set. They extended the lead to 10-2, and then 15-3, before finally closing out Woodrow 25-12 to win the match.
 “That 2-0 set lead is huge,” Smith said. “To be down and come back speaks a lot of where we are playing right now. I like our heart and guts. We don’t think we are out of any set. We had the momentum and then had a fast start in set three.”
 Harris led GW with 11 kills, followed by 10 for Birch. Also for the Patriots, Ella Hall had 21 assists, and Caroline Demers also was in double digits with 17 assists.

Australia's decision to take part in Malabar Exercise has outraged China, who has warned Canberra of "economic pain" if it continues to be part of US administration "roughneck gang".
 In an editorial piece, Communist party mouthpiece China Daily chided the Australian government for 'aggressively sending warships to China's doorsteps' as part of Exercise Malabar, UK Daily Mail reported.
 The first phase of the Malabar naval exercise has culminated recently in the Bay of Bengal with the participation by Indian Navy, United States Navy, Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force, and Royal Australian Navy.
 The 24th multinational maritime naval exercise, which started on November 3, was restricted to sea phase and conducted in "zero contact" format considering Covid-19 pandemic.
   
   
 "Although Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has declared that his government's approach to foreign policy is defined by 'strategic patience and consistency', particularly regarding China, his government's rash participation in the US administration's attempts to contain China belies that," the editorial said.
 "Canberra should realize it will get nothing from Washington in return for its collusion in its schemes, while Australia will pay tremendously for its misjudgment," it added.
 Chinese and Australian relations have deteriorated after Canberra called in April for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus without first consulting Beijing.
 Beijing has since imposed a large anti-dumping duty on Australian barley, banned beef exports from five abattoirs and instigated anti-dumping and subsidy investigations into cheap Australian wine in China.
 Another Chinese state media outlet, the Global Times recently warned Australia will pay an 'unbearable price' for 'sabotaging' bilateral relations and criticising the regime post-Covid.
 Recently, it was reported that importers across Beijing are expected to brace for a possible round of sanctions on copper ore and copper concentrate as well as sugar this week.
 The General Administration of Customs of China (GACC), last week, issued a notice to exporters claiming that it had found a pest in imported log timber from Queensland and has banned all log exports from the Australian state.
 The Chinese customs agency further claimed that it had found contamination in barley shipments from Australian grain exporter Emerald Grain as well.
 The propaganda publication accused Australia of prejudicially fueling anti- China sentiment and baselessly sanctioning Chinese companies, such as Huawei, who were shut out of the national 5G infrastructure grid on the grounds of national security.
 It also warned Canberra to 'steer clear of Washington's brinkmanship with China before it is too late'.

The issue of linking various forms of hierarchical oppression to class hierarchy and acting on the basis of class solidarity against all forms of oppression shouldn't be that hard to understand; ditto critical analysis of forms of nominal leftism that fail to make such linkages. If unreconstructed leftists want to fly off the handle over attempts at constructive self- criticism that is of course their choice, but it does beg the question as to whether their priorities are greater understanding, or reinforcing liberal orthodoxy against any intrusion of intersectional class politics. It is no one else fault but their own if they refuse to make a distinction between being criticised and being attacked, and invoke precisely the kind of single-issue politics being criticised on the basis of an 'if you question my judgement the enemies of social equality win'-type logic to silence further discussion of the topic. The irony there is not hard to discern. The left in general has a strong tendency to confuse rejection of its principles and ideals, and rejection of its often hideous praxis—which often seems to involve behaviour approximating everything it alleges to oppose in the right on the basis of an 'ends justifies the means' kind of mentality. Of course means have to be consistent with ends, since the one determines the other—not the other way around.

 DUBAI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Gulf stock markets were muted on Sunday after Joe Biden's U.S. election victory, reflecting expectations that his administration will not bring radical changes to the region's struggling economies.
 In Saudi Arabia, the stocks index declined 0.2% at market open but posted some gains in early trading and was up 0.3% at 0725 GMT. Other Gulf markets were mixed.
 Expectations of moderate oil prices and a weaker U.S. dollar under a Biden administration could add pressure on Gulf government's budget deficits, analysts say, accelerating the need for reforms.
 "Long-term, low global interest rates, low oil prices, and a weaker U.S. dollar matter most and are generally negative for the Gulf," said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Tellimer.
 "But, ultimately, the waning strategic interest of the U.S. in the region and the general disinterest of the U.S. electorate in most aspects of foreign policy is the same under Biden or his predecessor," he said.
 Biden's focus on climate change may not bode well for the oil-rich Gulf countries, which have been trying with limited success to diversify their economies and are now facing a severe economic contraction amid the twin shock of the coronavirus crisis and lower crude revenues.
 "Structural challenges faced by Gulf Cooperation Council economies including the energy transition are likely to be amplified," said Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
 Shares of Saudi oil giant Aramco were up 0.3% in early trade on Sunday, but a Saudi banker said that was partly due to expectations of dividend payments soon.
 During his election campaign Biden pledged to reassess ties with Saudi Arabia, demand more accountability over Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi´s killing in Riyadh´s Istanbul consulate in 2018, and end U.S. support for the Yemen war. Still, a radical reset of the U.S. approach to the Gulf region is viewed as unlikely.
 "A Biden presidency is not going to make or break Gulf economies," said Robert Mogielnicki, resident scholar at Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute.
 "The most consequential decisions for the overall health and sustainability of Gulf economies will be smart spending and implementing economic reforms within the region." (Reporting by Davide Barbuscia Editing by Mark Heinrich)

Yes, friends and neighbors, boys and girls and deer hunters around the world, it is that time. Time for your annual report on the season in the deer world known as “the rut.” This time, as we all know is for deer hunters THE event of the calendar year. If you are a deer hunter it is the Super Bowl, Mardi Gras, Christmas, your birthday and getting your tax return all rolled into one. This annual report on the rut has become something of a phenomenon in the outdoor writing world as hundreds of you out there have been asking for weeks when it would appear in the papers (OK, I might have stretched that one a little).
 For those who may not be that familiar with the deer in general or the rut season (or if you are reading this and thought you were checking on your horoscope), the rut is the mating season for the deer family. All cervidae have a rutting season and it is usually in fall (axis deer have their party in spring and early summer). So elk, deer, moose, caribou and others all have a time known as the rut.
 Deer hunters live for this season as it is the time of highest activity for those big, craggy-horned bucks that many of you seek (I know the correct term is antlers, not horns, on a buck’s head; sometimes I just like to say that because some of the finicky deer aficionados get uptight about it). As has been noted here before, dyed-in-the-wool deer hunters will sacrifice all manner of job security and domestic bliss to be in the woods, sitting up in a tree during this sacred time. Again, it is because wise old bucks throw caution to the wind and run around the country in search of available doe deer. Red-eyed, exhausted bucks are chasing does, rubbing antlers on every tree and bush, and fighting with any other buck that will take their challenge. The does, meanwhile, are running around the woods making a spectacle of themselves and playing it coy with the bucks (think of a singles bar on a crowded Saturday night before Covid-19).

In digging deeper, we find that the revolving door between transnational corporations and the state builds and sustains old boy networks and creates institutional linkages with private, unaccountable power; private security outnumbers state armed forces in most countries these days, private prisons create demand for draconian sentencing laws, and Amazon aids both the CIA and NSA by storing their copious surveillance data on its cloud servers. Public choice theorists sponsored by the Koch brothers propagandise jurists and policymakers behind the scenes to protect corporate power from democracy by conflating individual freedom and extreme class privilege. This and various other forms of totalitarian mischief are enabled by the legal fiction of corporate personhood—one that stands, not because of any clear judicial ruling that can be pointed to as a cogent argument as to why corporations should have the same rights as human beings, but as a series of _fait accomplis_ perpetrated in the closing decades of the 19th century, beginning with _Santa Clara County v.

Biden's Medicare concession was an important step in building trust between the wings of the party. The relationship was further solidified after Biden agreed to form several policy committees that featured high-profile figures from opposing factions.   Among the participants on Biden's climate committee: former Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Sanders' most vocal supporters. Biden didn't issue the invitation to Ocasio-Cortez personally, but was fully on board with bringing her onto the panel.   She'd go on to become a consistent advocate for the 77-year-old establishment figure's election, a stark contrast to the 2016 dynamics Clinton faced from the left flank.

Trump, on his part, may be down but not out and will campaign for the Senate run-offs in Georgia to remain politically relevant in Republican party.
 China's all weather ally Pakistan also heaving a sigh of relief at the exit of President Trump but New Delhi believes that incoming administration will be tough on terrorism, particularly after the recent Islamist attacks in Europe by migrants. The president-elect will continue with past policy of exiting from Afghanistan but that won't be easy as the US intelligence agencies and Pentagon (Trump dismissed their advice) have been reporting the escalation of Taliban violence with the backing of Haqqani network and Quetta based Shura with direct involvement of Pakistan deep state.
 As president-elect is expected to work with expert advice on Afghanistan, then the role of British, who are tied up with Pakistan, may diminish in the near future. Islamabad's double play in Afghanistan is now known to its former friends like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia with proof. Pakistan's problem in fact may multiply with president-elect Biden having a very poor opinion about Islamabad's newfound ally Turkey.
 Iran's belief that US sanctions may be lifted by incoming Biden administration's hitching back with Europe on nuclear deal with Tehran may come true as the new administration will move towards multilateralism, which was scorned by the present Trump administration. With the US expected to seek accommodation with Europe on global issues like Climate Change and health due to on-going pandemic, frayed ties with Germany will be on the mend. The US ties with Russia are expected to decline further under the incoming administration.
 While New Delhi will wait till January 2021 for formal engagement with the new administration, it appears most confident in dealing with the new occupant of the White House.

Thanks. And thanks for your question, Ron. Obviously, there’s been a fair amount in the public domain about Coursera, given where they, where it is in size, where it is in its saturation. And there’s been articles written about that may or may not go public. So to the degree that we comment, we comment simply what’s in the public domain, which – what’s in the public domain, leads the investment public to believe that they will contemplate upon – they’re headed towards a public offering.

Pakistan's pace legend and former captain Wasim Akram has backed white-ball skipper Babar Azam to also take over Test captaincy from the tour of New Zealand and urged him to be more assertive. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is expected to announce a new Test captain on November 11 to replace Azhar Ali, who will however remain a part of the 35-member jumbo squad for the New Zealand tour, where the national team will play two Tests and three T20 Internationals.
 "You ask me as a former player, yes, I back Babar to become Test captain because he is our future and he can continue for a long time," Akram said on YouTube channel 'Cricket Baaz'.
 "If the PCB appoints him they should for a proper time so that at least there is no confusion as to who is in charge in the dressing room."
 One of the game's greatest fast bowlers, Akram has also led the national team during his glorious international career, which included a World Cup triumph and plenty of individual accolades. "I back Babar because I don't want to see those days when I was playing and there were around four to five captains in our dressing room.
   
   
 "He is our best player and people who say that making him Test captain will affect his batting, don't buy that because he is a batsman and it is his job to score runs. "Aren't Virat Kohli or Kane Williamson also captains and top batsmen," the former fast bowling great asked.
 Akram said that the experiment to make Misbah-ul-Haq head coach and chief selector has not worked as Pakistan cricket has not seen any improvement in recent times. "At times I get the feeling they are still stuck in the 90s mindset. I get the feeling, at times, some are only playing for their runs. This doesn't work anymore and you just need to look at other teams to realise this."
 He said Pakistan cricket badly needed consistency in selection and continuity in captaincy. He also advised Babar to take more control as captain and implement his decisions. "He has to get rid of this feeling in the social media that it is Misbah who is taking all the decisions behind the scenes.
 "I see Babar as the best choice because I am optimistic that in time he will learn a lot, he is a good learner, he will improve and he will become a good captain and leader and we should have stability in captaincy when the 2023 World Cup is held.
 "Even when I came into cricket I took years to change my personality and groom myself. Babar will also groom himself."
 Akram also said that he didn't believe that to be captain it was necessary for Babar to speak English. "There is no shame if he converses in Urdu, he should be good at conversing in Urdu."
 Akram said that Babar will learn to express himself better and interact confidently with the media and other people as captain in a few months' time. "I have always supported the policy of having someone young as captain because it ensures he will serve for at least five to six years time.
 "When South Africa appointed Graeme Smith as captain after the 2003 World Cup he was, I think, only 22 and look where he went." Akram also didn't agree with suggestions to make Mohammad Rizwan the captain or vice-captain.
 "Look how many matches has he played? I know he will be upset with me for saying this but he has to first establish himself in the team to be considered as a candidate." Asked about his role in the PCB's cricket committee, Akram bluntly said it was serving no purpose.
 "First of all cricket committee, we haven't had a meeting for a long time now except for a brief meeting before COVID-19. No one has called or invited us. There is no use for it. I don't know why I am there because there is no point in me being there because nothing is happening."

One thing that has aided states in their planning so far is the fact that, by and large, scientists involved in the vaccine program—both in the government and at pharmaceutical manufacturers—have united in an unprecedented show of support for established scientific criteria for evaluating vaccine candidates. But it won’t be easy for the Biden Administration to persuade the public to get vaccinated if and when the COVID-19 shots are available. “I’ve heard from people all over the country who say they won’t get ‘the Trump vaccine.’ But it should not be ‘the Biden vaccine,’ either,” says Frieden. “The point is that it’s the COVID vaccine—it’s not a political vaccine.”

The White House will have a new occupant shortly. What does this mean for India? The Modi government's connection with President elect Joe Biden goes back to the days when External Affairs S. Jaishankar was Indian Ambassador to US during the Obama administration and present Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu was his deputy. The two have kept in touch with close advisors of President elect Biden ensuring that US maintains its bipartisan consensus towards India.
 As far as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is concerned, he runs foreign policy on a personal touch with Indian interests as a top priority. He only gives up on a country or an institution after the latter shows duplicity in bilateral relations.
 No marks for guessing the countries in that category.
 While the Indian foreign policy will indeed have to recalibrate its approach towards the incoming Biden administration, New Delhi knows that president- elect is a collegial guy, who was more approachable to Republican adversaries as a vice president than the president during the Obama years. A quintessential politician who stayed more than half his life in Washington and knows the wrangling at Capitol Hill.
   
   
 Unlike President Trump who hid his strategy behind a brash style, the incoming President will be more predictable in dealing with the world. He is expected to be tough yet not confrontational with China, will mend fences with Europe and be slightly rough with Russia.
 Even though the Chinese experts are gloating over President Trump's defeat, the US system now firmly believes that Beijing is not only an adversary but also a threat to future. So one should not expect bombastic statements against the Communist Party of China during Biden-era but US policy on China has turned full circle and there should be a build-up on the Asia pivot that was promised but not delivered in the Obama administration. Trump, on his part, may be down but not out and will campaign for the Senate run-offs in Georgia to remain politically relevant in Republican party.

Gee and Czambel’s collaboration started with what they thought would be a 10-page document on Thoms Run Road’s history. It wound up as a 360-page history that launched at the Collier Township Community Center. When Pelkey came on board, the next book’s focus was not a chronological reporting of events but a profile of the community’s people.
 “The value that we hold is that all people in the township built the community and should be celebrated for their contributions,” Gee says. “Some farmed, some made horseshoes, some mined, some ran stores, some worked on the railroad and so on. They were all important, but until our work started, most had been forgotten and were unrecognized.” They then worked to identify as many people as possible who lived in the villages across Collier Township. “Obviously, we couldn’t document every one of the 17,300 people named in the 1880-1940 census data,” says Gee, “but we did a great job recording the history and facts that we uncovered.”
 Gee is proud of their work, being the first to document Collier’s history in considerable detail. “We have recorded the history and stories that the current generation born in the 1940s know from their grandparents and will be lost with their deaths.” They chose the words “Forgotten People” because so few current residents know much about the rich history and the families that came before them. “Very few people talk about the hard life that most families had in the rural and impoverished coal towns,” Gee says. “No plaques or historical markers are identifying who lived where. There are no celebrations for fifth and sixth generation families. Those who started small businesses aren’t known or remembered. There were hard-working, family-oriented people in the villages that wanted a better life for themselves and better opportunities for their children. We didn’t want the history and the people to be forgotten or overlooked.”
 Gee says he is amazed at what he has learned about their history and hard work. What does he imagine they would think about Collier Township today? “Given what they had and how they lived, they would be agape,” he says. “There are about the same number of people in the township, but they drive everywhere and have such freedom. I think the people would be amazed at how much easier living is today but how much people are distraught with stress.”
 The trio is preparing to launch a third book called "Memories of Collier Township," which Gee says will be a pictorial history of the township. They're targeting a Dec. 1 print date, and you can find their books at lulu.com.

The warrants are justified in similar cases — which are not frequent, but real.
 No-knock entry, however, should be barred absent case-specific assertions establishing a danger to police and real risk of evidence destruction. Even then, where searches won’t yield evidence of violent felony crime or prevent imminent public harm, a cost-benefit analysis should bar no-knock entry. Moreover, the “war on drugs” should not justify no-knock warrants and militarized SWAT teams to bootstrap nonviolent narcotics offenses.
