KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — In the Kansas City Chiefs' regular-season finale, that must-win game against the Los Angeles Chargers that helped them secure a first-round playoff bye, there was a play late in the third quarter that caused Andy Reid to laugh. The Chiefs coach watched from the sideline as Terrell Suggs, their recently acquired ageless wonder, dominated the woebegone offensive tackle assigned to block him and put some pressure on Philip Rivers. The Chargers quarterback moved in the pocket right into the arms of Frank Clark, the Chiefs' other defensive end, who cleaned up the sack. “He was right there to take him,” Reid said, “and then 55 got the sack. He could've just gone, ‘Well, you know.’ But he laughed about it. He goes, ‘Man, I worked all of this through and my man here gets the sack? Well, good for him.’” Good for the Chiefs, too. The late-season addition of Suggs has only helped a Kansas City pass rush that had been humming along most of the season, and one that could prove pivotal in its divisional round matchup against Houston. The veteran of 18 postseason games has helped to cover for the loss of Emmanuel Ogbah and Alex Okafor to season-ending injuries, and he proved with that pressure of Rivers — and a sack later in the game — that he can still get after the quarterback. That might not bode so well for the Texans, who gave up an astounding seven sacks to the Buffalo Bills in their overtime victory in last weekend's wild-card round. Not only that, quarterback Deshaun Watson was hit 12 times during the game. Now, the Bills have one of the best defenses in the AFC, and their 44 sacks this season put them just outside the top 10 of all teams league-wide. But flying under the radar and just ahead of them in the pecking order was Kansas City, which piled up 45 sacks despite losing...

AUSTIN, Texas -- Retired state employees Vickey Benford, 63, and Joan Caldwell, 61, are Golden Rollers, a group of the over-50 set that gets out on assorted bikes -- including trikes for adults they call "three wheels of awesome" -- for an hour of trail riding and camaraderie.      "I love to exercise, and I like to stay fit," said Caldwell, who tried out a recumbent bike, a low-impact option that can be easier on the back. "It keeps me young."      Benford encouraged Caldwell to join the organized rides, which have attracted more than 225 riders at city rec centers and senior activity centers. The cyclists can choose from a small, donated fleet of recumbent bikes, tandem recumbents and tricycles.      "With seniors, it's less about transportation and more about access to the outdoors, social engagement and quality of life," said Christopher Stanton, whose idea for Golden Rollers grew out of the Ghisallo Cycling Initiative, a youth biking nonprofit he founded in 2011.      But that's not all, according to brain scientists. They point to another important benefit: Exercising both body and brain can help people stay healthier longer.      The new thinking about aging considers not just how long one lives, but how vibrant one stays later in life.      "If you're living, you want to be living well," said Tim Peterson, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. "Most people who were interested in life span and were studying genes -- which control life span -- switched to 'healthspan.'"      "Healthspan," a coinage now gaining traction, refers to the years that a person can expect to live in generally good health -- free of chronic illnesses and cognitive decline that can emerge near life's end. Although there's only so much a person can do to delay the onset of disease, there's plenty that scientists are learning to improve your chances of a better healthspan.      The work takes on special resonance in light of a new report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that life expectancy in the United States has decreased in recent years. A rise in midlife mortality (ages 25 to 64) has dragged down the overall expectancy.      "The idea is to make people productive, healthier and happier longer and more capable taking care of themselves," said Andreana Haley, a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who is among this breed of researchers working to understand healthspan. "We now live a long time with a lot of chronic diseases, and it's not fun. It's costly -- in terms of productivity, caregiving responsibilities, cost of health care."      Haley, who collaborates with exercise physiologists, nutritionists, behavioral neuroscientists and physicians, said researchers from many other disciplines are also studying healthspan, such as nurses, speech pathologists and pharmacists.      Their work is inspired by an aging U.S. population with changing needs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 10,000 people a day turn 65, the nation's fastest-growing population segment.      "We have a lot of people who will need to be taken care of in the next 50 years," she said, "and fewer young people to do the care."      Haley, with UT's Aging and Longevity Center, focuses her work on midlife, which she defines as ages 40 to 60, a time when health choices can have a big impact on older years. She's especially interested in brain health.      Her team is collaborating with UT's Human Laser Lab to pilot the use of low- level light therapy to increase brain energy and improve cognitive performance.      Because of this close brain-body connection, any degeneration in the brain affects not only cognitive function but also areas that control weight, appetite, personality, mood and blood pressure.      Online games and brain-training exercises have become popular as another way to keep the brain sharp.      However, research on brain training reflects mixed results, including a study published last year in the journal Neuropsychologia, which "calls into question the benefit of cognitive training beyond practice effects."      Still, aging experts urge people as they age to work to keep mentally active, as well as physically active, to lengthen their healthspan.

A key part of the administration's proposal centers on whether agencies must consider the cumulative environmental effects of things like pipelines, which have attracted protests by climate activists across the country.
 Under the new limits, federal agencies would only need to consider effects that are "reasonably foreseeable" and have a "close causal relationship" to the project. That could mean simply the impact of building the pipeline.
 Environmental groups say agencies should also consider the impact of the oil and gas that would flow through it, to help the country plan for limiting the carbon dioxide emissions that warm the climate.
 Mary Neumayr, chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, says the average times for agencies to complete an environmental impact statement is 4 1/2 years, and it is even longer for highway projects, which average seven years.
 This delay, she says, "deprives Americans of the benefits of modernized bridges and roads that enable them to get home to their families."
 Industry groups say streamlining NEPA regulations would lead to more and better-paying jobs, as long-delayed projects could be built. In a letter to the administration last year, they said every $1 billion spent on infrastructure leads to 13,000 jobs.
 Environmental groups also criticize a proposed two-year time limit for agencies to issue comprehensive environmental impact statements and restrictions on public comments, including topics covered and how quickly they have to be submitted.
 The proposal would also give federal agencies more power to resolve disputes that could delay a project and limit the projects that are subject to NEPA review. For example, it would exempt "non-federal" projects with little government funding.
 In another controversial change, companies could essentially conduct their own environmental reviews.
 "This is a clearly a conflict of interest," says Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president at Center for American Progress. She was a managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality during the Obama administration.
 "It's baffling that the Trump administration thinks handing the keys of environmental review to big polluters is going to pass muster," says Goldfuss.
 The White House CEQ will collect public comments for at least 60 days before making the rule final. But there are hurdles that could keep it from taking effect.
 For one thing, if Trump loses his re-election bid, it's likely that the next president will drop the revised rules. Even if he wins, environmental groups are expected to file legal challenges. And experts point out that the actual underlying law remains the same.
 "The law require federal agencies to report the environmental impacts of their actions that significantly affect 'the quality of the human environment,' " says Bruce Huber of Notre Dame Law School. "If the regulations announced today drive agencies to diminish the extent or quality of their reporting, federal courts may very well conclude that their reports do not comply with the law."

He said that while all types of soybeans that had SCN resistance yielded better than those without, there was a variety that stuck out. The more common resistance source, PI88788, did not perform as consistently well as Peking resistance, which is only found in about 5% of soybean varieties.
 Tylka said the genes found in the PI88788 variety have been around for 25-30 years. He compared this to using the same herbicide on weeds for a long period. Over time, the weed develops resistance and is more difficult to keep at bay.
 “What we are seeing every year, more and more, is the varieties with Peking resistance yielding higher and higher in the overall rank of things,” he said. “And that’s nothing to do with the genetics of the soybean varieties, and everything to do with the nematode becoming resistant to resistance.”
 Over the last five to seven years, the soybeans with Peking resistance have become one of the more consistent top yielding varieties, Tylka said. The results in their southeast Iowa location showed just how drastic the difference could be in some scenarios.
 “We had 67 varieties with PI88788 and two varieties with Peking resistance, and those two Peking varieties finished as the top two,” Tylka said. “Those two Peking varieties yielded 73 and 71 bushels per acre, and the next highest yield, the top yielding PI88788, was 58.7 bushels per acre. That’s 14 bushels less.”

The dramatic blast of more than a dozen missiles caused no casualties at the two bases, although U.S., Canadian and British officials said Thursday that evidence showed that an Iranian anti-aircraft missile probably downed a Ukrainian jetliner near Tehran just a few hours after Iran launched its attack on the Iraqi bases. They said the strike, which killed all 176 people on board, could have been a mistake.


  Investigators from Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization offered no immediate explanation for the disaster. A preliminary Iranian investigative report released Thursday said that the airliner pilots never made a radio call for help and that the aircraft was trying to turn back for the airport when the burning plane went down.


  Even though U.S. and Iraqi officials said there had been no casualties, Iranian state TV claimed that some 80 U.S. soldiers had been killed in the air strike at the bases — a death toll repeated Thursday by a top Iranian military general.


  At the White House, President Donald Trump said Iran “appears to be standing down," while Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei described the missile attack as “a slap” against America.


  Across state media, the Iranian government is positioning its retaliatory strike as a victory.


  The hard-line Kahyan newspaper proclaimed Iran's missiles damaged U.S. dignity, while another hard-line daily, Javan, said it was America's first admission of failure in its history.


  The reformist daily Aftab Yazd led with the headline: “Iran's slap makes Trump withdraw and declare peace.” Another reformist daily paper, Arman Melli, called it “A dark night for Americans.”


  Despite Tehran's claims that the strikes killed Americans, Iranians have access to other sources of information. Although social media sites like Twitter are blocked, Iranians are able to access it and others through virtual private networks, or VPNs.


  Ali Azimi, a 41-year-old engineer, said Iran's retaliation was “excessive.”


  “We shouldn't have taken revenge because they could have hit and destroyed us,” he said.


  In somewhat mixed messages Thursday, President Hassan Rouhani warned of a “very dangerous response” if the U.S. makes “another mistake,” but a senior commander vowed even “harsher revenge.”


  Mohammad Taghizadeh, a 30-year-old resident of Tehran, described the Iranian actions as a “good start.”


  “As the supreme leader said, it was a slap. It was not satisfying and bigger things should happen,” he said.


  He also echoed a familiar refrain of deep suspicion toward Washington.

 Scientists have trained cuttlefish to wear specialised 3D glasses to investigate how the cephalopods determine the best distance to strike moving prey.
 The research, published in the journal Science Advances, revealed cuttlefish use stereopsis - the perception of depth produced by the reception in the brain of visual stimuli from both eyes in combination - to perceive depth when hunting a moving target.
 Cuttlefish catch a meal by deploying their tentacles and, to be successful in their strike, they must compute depth to position themselves at the correct distance from the prey. If they are too close, the prey may be spooked and escape while if they are too far, the tentacles will not reach, according to the researchers from the University of Minnesota in the US. To test how the cuttlefish brain computes distance to an object, the team trained cuttlefish to wear 3D glasses and strike at images of two walking shrimp, each a different colour displayed on a computer screen at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, US.
 The images were offset, allowing for the researchers to determine if the cuttlefish were comparing images between the left and the right eyes to gather information about distance to their prey. The process of comparing the images is called stereopsis, and is the same way humans determine depth. Depending on the image offset, the cuttlefish would perceive the shrimp to be either in front of or behind the screen.
 The cuttlefish predictably struck too close to or too far from the screen, according to the offset. 'How the cuttlefish reacted to the disparities clearly establishes that cuttlefish use stereopsis when hunting,' said Trevor Wardill, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. 'When only one eye could see the shrimp, meaning stereopsis was not possible, the animals took longer to position themselves correctly.
 'When both eyes could see the shrimp, meaning they utilised stereopsis, it allowed cuttlefish to make faster decisions when attacking. This can make all the difference in catching a meal,' said Wardill. Through this process, the researchers also found the mechanism that underpins cuttlefish stereopsis is likely different from humans due to the cuttlefish successfully determining the distance from anti-correlated stimulus.
 It means the left and the right eye images have the same pattern, but are reversed in luminance, the researchers said. Humans cannot do this reliably, they noted. 'While cuttlefish have similar eyes to humans, their brains are significantly different,' said Paloma Gonzalez-Bellido, assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. 'We know that cuttlefish brains aren't segmented like humans. They do not seem to have a single part of the brain - like our occipital lobe - dedicated to processing vision.
 'Our research shows there must be an area in their brain that compares the images from a cuttlefish's left and right eye and computes their differences,' Bellido said. Cuttlefish have the ability to rotate their eyes to a forward- facing position, a unique trait that sets them apart from their cephalopod relatives such as squid and octopus. It is possible that cuttlefish are the only cephalopods with the ability to compute and use stereopsis, the researchers said. Mantids are the only other invertebrate species known to use stereopsis, they said.

Such homespun details in an artwork appealed to Councilmember Margie Mohler. “Thinking through the concepts of handprints, I think it’s very meaningful to Yountville and all the past students,” she said, adding that a piece honoring the school should be more than a monument and include an interactive element to engage passers-by.
 The council supported forming a committee of school leaders, arts commissioners and two council members to help settle on an artist, design and site for a tribute piece.
 “This is a great idea and there will be no shortage of ideas what it should look like, what it should be made of, and where it should go,” said Mayor John Dunbar, who predicted a committee can more quickly sort through different art types and concepts for the installation.
 A Yountville Elementary tribute would become the town’s third prominent outdoor artwork in the past three years, following the 2017 debut of “The Memory of a Tree” double mural at the Highway 29 underpass at California Drive and the dedication of “Faces of Freedom,“ a monument honoring U.S. service members, for Veterans Day 2018.
 The site of Yountville’s earliest school is uncertain but may have been on a 5-acre tract east of Yount Street, where an existing one-room schoolhouse received an addition in 1881, according to a 2015 article by the Napa County Historical Society. Classes moved around 1920 into a tile-topped Mission Revival structure, which was converted into the seat of government after Yountville Elementary moved into a new building next door more than half a century later.

Orr farms with his parents Jeff and Peggy Orr. His dad is in charge of the row crops — soybeans and corn — and Orr takes care of the cow-calf operation and hay sales. He grows prairie hay that he feeds to all his own cattle, and he grows alfalfa hay that he sells to neighbors.
 “If I had the manpower, I could sell more alfalfa,” he said.
 The Orr Farm started in 1945 when Orr’s grandfather first leased the ground. Orr shared a unique story of how the family ended up settling in the Platte Valley district. It goes back to his mom’s dad.
 “Grandpa ran away from home when he was about 13 years old and ended up in the Platte Valley,” Orr said. “He worked for Charles Frye, one of the bigger farmers in the Hershey area. Then Ethel Hood, daughter of one of the railroad workers (Boss Hilbert Waechter) needed a young renter.
 “My grandpa had a good reputation in the valley and he eventually had the opportunity to buy the farm.”
 While many farmers and ranchers were eager to see 2019 go, it was a good year for Orr.
 “Corn and soybeans were up for us across the board,” he said. “We were very fortunate. Didn’t get the large rains other parts of the state received.”
 His farm benefited from windows of rain with enough dry weather to complete planting and other field work.
 “It was a cool and wet spring by Mother Nature, but it was right on schedule and a good growing season for us,” Orr said.
 He knows he’s always at the mercy of Mother Nature, but also juggles time management and optimizes resources on his family’s farm to cut costs.

In 2015, the PATH Act required 501(c)(4) organizations to notify the IRS of their existence within 60 days of being established. The PATH Act also provided for the assessment of penalties on late filers and nonfilers and, in some cases, on the officials responsible for filing the notification. Implementation of the new notification requirement meant the IRS had to develop new forms and changes to its information technology systems, along with new guidance to help taxpayers comply with the notification requirement.
 The new report from TIGTA found the IRS hasn’t done enough to identify noncompliant 501(c)(4) organizations, even though it has various sources of information that would allow it to do so. Once an organization notifies the IRS of its existence, the IRS can use the information to enforce filing compliance of the required annual return.
 “TIGTA identified 9,774 organizations that were potentially required to file a notification but did not,” said the report. “These organizations and their responsible officials were potentially subject to assessment of more than $48.4 million and $47.5 million in delinquency penalties, respectively. However, many of these organizations may not have understood or even been aware of the notification requirement because many of them filed other documents that informed the IRS of their existence.”
 TIGTA noted that the IRS recently began assessing delinquency penalties on organizations that don’t file their notifications in time, but it didn’t assess such penalties prior to February 2019. TIGTA identified 1,719 organizations that didn’t file notifications in time before the IRS started assessing the penalty. These organizations and the responsible officials could have been subject to more than $4.8 million and $3.1 million in delinquency penalties, respectively. However, TIGTA acknowledged that some of the organizations could have reasonable cause for filing untimely notifications and might not be subject to the penalty.
 TIGTA recommended that the IRS’s Exempt Organizations function determine the feasibility of working with state governments to identify new organizations that are required to file a notification with the IRS. The IRS should also do research on the organizations already identified by TIGTA for its report and determine if any compliance actions are necessary, the report suggested. TIGTA also recommended the IRS use the available information to enforce compliance of notification requirements and determine if the untimely filers had reasonable cause for filing untimely or if assessing the delinquency penalties was warranted. The IRS should also update its notices and procedures to fully implement the law, TIGTA suggested.
 In response to the report, IRS management agreed to use the available information to enforce compliance and update its notices and procedures. However, the IRS didn’t agree to work with state governments, take actions to bring organizations identified by TIGTA into compliance, and determine the applicability of penalties for untimely filers. For its part, TIGTA said it believes the actions it recommended would improve the detection of noncompliant activity and ensure more consistency in how the IRS enforces the law for similar organizations.
 The IRS also disagreed with some of TIGTA’s estimates: “Beyond overstating the universe of potential non-filers, the report’s estimates of associated penalties are theoretical,” wrote Tamera Ripperda, commissioner of the IRS’s Tax-Exempt and Government Entities Division, in response to the report. “TIGTA acknowledges that reasonable cause exceptions may apply, and penalties on managers would be possible in the first instance only if the organization did not submit the Form 8976 within a specified period after a demand was issued.”
 Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, also responded to the report. "“The watchdog report issued today shows that thousands of nonprofits eligible to engage in political activity have failed to properly disclose their existence, and the IRS isn’t doing enough to identify noncompliance or enforce penalties," he said in a statement Thursday. "The IRS is once again asleep at the wheel on enforcing rules for politically- active nonprofits, and this comes at a time when illegal dark and foreign money threatens to influence the 2020 election. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is working to finalize regulations that would eliminate donor reporting requirements for dark money organizations. It’s a one-two punch to election integrity.”

The Essex Police Department (EPD) advised the public this past week that there have been traffic signal changes for a couple intersections along the heavily- traveled Susie Wilson Road.
 The changes specifically affect the crosswalks spanning Pinecrest Drive and Joshua Way on the Lowe’s side of the street.
 When using the push buttons to traverse across Susie Wilson Road, pedestrians will still be in a “protected walk phase” and have traffic stopped at that particular intersection for a brief period of time. However, if walking along Susie Wilson Road and traversing either Pinecrest Drive or Joshua Way near Lowe’s, pedestrians will be doing so in a “concurrent phase.”
 With this new format, pedestrians will have a “leading pedestrian interval” before the Susie Wilson Road traffic is given a green light--meaning that people crossing Pinecrest Drive or Joshua Way will have a “head start” to get through the crosswalk. However, they will still need to be cautious and alert for all vehicles making turns through the intersection once the light changes from red.
 Motorists who are turning during this phase are required to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk, but EPD encourages pedestrians to be vigilant and aware of automobiles that are intending to drive across those walkways.
 Part of the new system includes separate push buttons which have been installed for each crosswalk. Pedestrians need to push the button that has the arrow pointing in the direction they intend to travel in order to activate the proper walk signals.

MILTON - Samantha Bevins walks briskly into the local Starbucks, her hair still wet from showering after hockey practice. She wears Milton Academy sweatpants, a T-shirt and her hair in a messy bun -- an unlikely uniform for someone who helped draft state legislation.
 In addition to playing varsity ice hockey and tennis at Milton Academy, Bevins, 17, has spent the last year lobbying on Beacon Hill. Her goal: To be able to vote in March's presidential primary, even though she won't yet be 18.
 Bevins' bill, which is before the Legislature's Joint Committee on Election Laws, would allow 17-year-olds to vote in preliminary and primary elections if they will be 18 by the time the general election is held.
 Her quest began when she attended an event for U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in New York with her mother last winter.
 "A lot of people were talking about how they had just made this a law in Iowa and how it was a big deal," said Bevins, who will turn 18 in October, just in time to vote in the Nov. 3 general election. "A few weeks later, I Googled it and realized Massachusetts wasn't one of the states that had this law."      After doing research and composing a seven-page document, Bevins called her state representative, Joan Meschino, D-Hull, who was immediately on board with the idea. Meschino assigned one of her college interns to work with Bevins and compile a final report, which Bevins completed over the summer.      "I thought it was really incredible because even though I am 17, they let me proofread and draft everything," Bevins said. "They've really kept me present in the whole process, which has been really important to me."
 Meschino was impressed by Bevins.      "This young woman is terrific, smart, very self-motivated, very bright," Meschino said. "Her sort of generation, they're very engaged."
 Almost 20 percent of Massachusetts 18- and 19-year-olds voted in 2018, according to data collected by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.
 Almost half of U.S. states -- including Connecticut, Maine, Vermont and Maryland -- allow 17-year-olds to vote in preliminary or primary elections if they will be 18 years old by the corresponding general election.
 Meschino and state Sen. Patrick O'Connor, R-Weymouth, filed bipartisan bills in late 2019 that would add Massachusetts to that list. Both bills were referred to the Committee on Election Laws.
 Massachusetts isn't the only state where lowering the voting age for primaries is up for debate. In Texas, similar legislation is sitting in committee, while in California the measure was approved by the state assembly and might appear on the November ballot.
 "There is so much importance in the primary process, especially now," said O'Connor. "I think before, both parties put up more of the establishment picks in the '80s and '90s. Now, you're seeing fields of 20-plus candidates on both sides … so the choice has become more important."
 Bevins said people her age want a say in choosing who appears on the ballot in November.
 "High schoolers definitely know what's going on. Just being able to check the Democrat or Republican box on general election day isn't enough," Bevins said.
 She said she has been politically engaged most of her life, following in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother, both of whom worked in the Clinton administration.      "They've taken me to political events since I was a kid and they've just taught me it's important," she said.      In addition to sports and schoolwork, Bevins has started her own political blog and Instagram account. On the latter, which has more than 800 followers, she posts "Instastories" as well as traditional posts to appeal to her peers.      "In general, that's kind of how I get my news," said fellow Milton Academy student Eliza Hartnick, 16, who set notifications on her phone to alert her every time Bevins posts. "It's so helpful. She's just such a role model for me, and it's so impressive how much she knows."
 Bevins said she hopes the law is enacted before Super Tuesday on March 3, the day of the Democratic primary in Massachusetts. Meschino, however, can't promise that the deadline will be met.
 "It's a late file bill, but I felt that it was important even if the timing didn't work out well enough," Meschino said. "Any advocacy we do now puts us further down the path for next session."
 The elections committee is expected to have a hearing on the proposals this month. Bevins doesn't know when, but she is ready and excited, having written her oral testimony almost two months ago.
 Until then, she'll continue working on her art project and math homework, watching the news with her mother in the evening and playing pingpong with her brother, Wesley, on the new table they got for Christmas.
 "This whole process. … I've proved to myself that, yeah I'm 17, yeah I'm in high school, but I can stand in front of a group of adults and talk about what I'm passionate about," she said. "Even if it can't pass before Super Tuesday, if it can pass to the generations behind me, that means a lot."      Bevins is accepting support letters for bills H.4161 and SD.2623 at Samantha_bevins21@milton.edu.
