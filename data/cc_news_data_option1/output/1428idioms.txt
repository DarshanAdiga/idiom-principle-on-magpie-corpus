Dozen of new, quicker tests are already under development or coming onto the market. The best approach would involve testing at home, Bedford said. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is seeking federal approval for home delivery of nasal swabs that would be sent back to a central lab for processing.
 The next step would be the use of digital tracking, via cellphone data, to almost instantaneously alert people who were exposed to someone newly diagnosed as positive. Digital tracking was a powerful tool in controlling the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, in China, South Korea and other Asian nations — but at a cost to privacy many Americans would never tolerate.
 In South Korea, where 5 percent of the population was tested, cellphone alerts about potential exposures were often uncomfortably detailed, including age and gender of the infected person. In Taiwan, anyone who tested positive was required to download a phone app monitored by health officials to ensure compliance with quarantine — and the country never had to close businesses or order people to stay home, said Chunhuei Chi, director of the Center for Global Health at Oregon State University.
 “That detailed tracking of every single case is the reason people in Taiwan feel safe to go to bars or restaurants,” Chi said.
 Bedford and others recently launched and are seeking funding for a project called NextTrace that would allow people who opt in with their cellphone data to anonymously register if they test positive. Alerts would go out automatically to others in the network who might have come close enough for exposure. Several similar programs have been launched across the country, and on Friday, tech heavyweights Apple and Google said they are introducing new tools for contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and phone apps. How well the programs work will depend on how many people enroll.
 Blood tests that detect antibodies to the virus will be another important component of the long-term control effort, Halloran said. Several versions, including finger-prick tests, are in the works, but only one has been approved by the FDA for emergency use.

The first photo shows a section of cliff just west of Agia Galini, where I was staying (in a hotel full of cats!). To my inexpert eye, it seems to show an interesting series of distinct phases of sedimentation. At Preveli, a westerly current has helped build the beach into a dam across the stream that flows through the gorge, causing that stream to turn abruptly west at its mouth, with a lagoon behind it. (Similar features can be seen at Seaton and at Mudeford on the south coast of England.)

Like with so many families, closure escaped Nichols. Both she and her daughter, Qunia Roberts, were hospitalized in Albany, Ga., three weeks ago after being infected with COVID-19. But while Nichols, 48, recovered and left the hospital with an oxygen tank, Roberts, 27, died Monday.
 Brand-new summer sandals, in shades of orange, yellow and gold, were stacked inside her daughter’s closet. Roberts had been excited just a few weeks ago to usher in spring with a pedicure.
 “You don’t expect a young person to die,” she said as she slipped Roberts’ glossy wigs and long eyelashes into a trash bag and packed up her work laptop, crocodile and snakeskin purses and floral 2020 planner.
 Nichols said her first-born had no medical conditions.
 The young software implementation specialist for a healthcare IT consulting company was lighthearted, a free spirit who loved watching “The Golden Girls” and Maury Povich’s show.
 Just a few days before she got sick, Roberts changed her Facebook profile to a shot of her spraying a can of Lysol.
 The last thing Roberts said to her mother, over the phone when she arrived at the ER, was “Mama, I love you. We ain’t gonna let this corona kills us.”

I started reading Jessica Pennington's _Meet Me at Midnight_ on an empty beach in Florida, near where I live on the Space Coast. There are rarely many people at the Canaveral National Seashore, and I thought it would be a fitting place to celebrate a new "summer at the lake" title. That beach is closed now. Looking back, this book and that sand feel like they happened a lifetime ago, in a different world. But that doesn't make _Meet Me at Midnight_ less wonderful in any way!


  The tale of Sidney Walters and Asher Marin is the bitingly hilarious enemies- to-lovers story I've been waiting for. It's a bit slow to start, as halcyon lazy summers sometimes are, as we get to know our dueling protagonists. Sidney and Asher are high school seniors. They are both swimmers. Their mothers were college roommates. Every year since they were 14, their families have summered at the lake together — and they love to hate each other, so much so that they've raised pranking to an art form.


  Sidney is a classic overthinker, but a brilliant strategist. Asher, on the other hand, has always secretly liked Sidney — but is terrible at communicating his feelings. Each summer is 56 days of exquisite torture for them both, and the book counts as we go along. There are a few unwritten rules about the pranks — for instance, they draw the line at physically hurting one another, but everything else is pretty much fair game. From Kool-Aid showers to fights over the "unicorn chair" to awkward family dinners, the animosity increases in intensity until Sidney takes a prank one step too far and the families get kicked out of their neighboring cabin rental properties. Happily, the Walterses and Marins solve the problem by securing a house on the lake large enough for them all. That's right, Sidney and Asher are forced to move in _together_.

But lockdowns can’t go on indefinitely, either. President Donald Trump, who extended federal social distancing guidelines through April, is now pushing to restart businesses by early May or even sooner.
 Keeping the virus under control in the long term will require an ambitious strategy that one Seattle scientist calls “the Apollo program of our times.”
 The basic approach is no different than for any other epidemic: Identify those who become infected, as well as those who have been exposed, and isolate them. But that would mean a massive scale-up of testing and contact tracing, at a time when even nursing homes still can’t get enough test kits and public health agencies are swamped.

There is, however, a true deal-breaker for the gaming side of things, and that's the space bar. When typing both hands are focused on the keyboard, thumbs on space bar, and it works exactly as you'd want. The problem is that pressing close to the middle, as you do for standard typing, works every time, while pressing the extreme ends of the bar doesn't register. The contact point is right in the center, and if you press on the left side (as you would in a WASD configuration) then what happens is one side remains up while the side you pressed goes down and the center switch doesn't make any kind of contact. Play an FPS with the jump button on the space bar? That's going to be hit and miss at best. I tried to reach out asking after this, thinking maybe my keyboard was defective in this one specific area, but with no response I've got no way to know otherwise.

India has decided to extend a strict nationwide lockdown imposed last month to stop the spread of the coronavirus, a top official says.


  On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with state ministers, and many of them urged the government to prolong the measure.


  Delhi's chief minister said Mr Modi had agreed to extend the lockdown, due to end on Tuesday, without giving details.


  There are concerns about how the curbs are affecting the poor and the economy.


  The spread of the virus has been varied in India with some states seeing bigger jumps in cases despite the shutdown. Millions of migrant workers have been left jobless with the poorest suffering most.


  India has confirmed 7,600 infections and 249 deaths, according to a tally by US-based Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. The true figures, however, are thought to be far higher.

We have no vaccine — and, barring a miracle, we won’t until next year. We have no effective treatments, although that may, with any luck, change. We have only very porous defenses — social distancing — which amount to a drastic, utterly unsustainable shift in how we live from day to day. And that’s it. We don’t know how contagious this virus is, how exactly it may mutate, how widespread it already is in the population at large, and even if it can reactivate in those who have recovered from infection.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — About 70 Alaska tribes have implemented travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, limiting incoming air, land and water traffic in remote villages scattered across the state.


  Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has given communities regulation leeway through their councils and other governmental entities, so travel restrictions vary throughout the state, Indian Country Today reported.


  Essential workers and their necessary travel are still permitted.


  “But the less mixing we have going on at this point, the more we slow the virus down,” Dunleavy said. “Right now they are (helping out), but if there are issues or incidences where folks, let’s say go overboard, then we can have that discussion with them.”


  Residents of the Northwest Alaska Inupiat village of Kivalina, population 379, who want to leave must notify the tribal administrator of departure and return dates, the reason for the trip and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return, community leaders said.


  Those rules apply to travel by flights and snow-machine from neighboring communities, since the village is not connected by road to any other community, leaders said.


  Alaska had reported about 250 known cases of COVID-19 and seven related deaths as of Friday. Most are in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and other communities connected by road, but there no confirmed cases in any small off-road villages.

And yet we carried on, scanning the horizon for a pharmaceutical breakthrough, which kept disappearing from view.

The Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has upended daily life throughout the city. The waste and recycling industry's essential services continue, but for frontline workers it is no longer business as usual.


  For Pune-based Swach (Solid waste collection and handling- a cooperative of self-employed waste collectors) which has a team of 3,500 sanitation workers on ground, less number of safety kits containing masks,gloves and other essential items, is a major worry.


  According to Harshad Barde, director, Swach, the organisation has 95 per cent of its staff on ground. Though the access to sealed areas is limited, garbage collection from other areas is fully functioning.


  "The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has provided us with 6,500 gloves, masks and soaps and are also making arrangements for additional 35,000 soaps (10 per member). We also have 7,000 gloves and scarves (2 per member) which we received from another organisation.However, these resources are not sufficient," said Barde.


  In the coming months, Swach members will need six gloves per member, that is 21,000 gloves, 70,000 soaps (2 per member) and 7,000 scarves (2 per member) in order to remain safe, according to Barde.


  Though the PMC is trying to procure more safety kits, Swach has appealed for assistance from individuals and groups too for gloves and masks.


  The masks that the Swach workers wear are washable. For Mangal Gaikwad who works in Kotbagi lane in Aundh, mask is a new thing,however, she wears it duly without fail. "Earlier, we used to wear gloves, but now ever since Cvoid-19, we have been told to wear the mask as well. We have received two of these. Initially it was uncomfortable, but since we have no choice and I don't want to fall sick, I have to wear it,' she said.


  Kalyani Patil, who oversees the operations across PMC, said, "It is difficult for us to train the waste pickers about Covid-19 in such a short time. We trained the Prabhag (ward) coordinators with help of pamphlets and distributed the same to everyone explaining them the proper ways of sanitising and the importance of wearing masks and gloves. Initially, a lot of them were averse to the idea of masks, but with neighbours and the areas they visited all following protocol, they all began wearing a mask or even a scarf or handkerchief without any complaints."

Missouri and Kansas appear on the doorstep of restoring their gridiron rivalry.


   


  Missouri athletic director Jim Sterk wrote in an email to donors Thursday morning that "a four-game football series is being contracted as of this writing."


   


  No specific dates, venues or terms have been announced, but mutual interest to renew the football matchup has existed since last year. Sterk said in October the schools were getting closer to finalizing a football series, with Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City a possible host site for the relaunch of the Border War.


   


  Games in Columbia and Lawrence could also be part of the agreement.


   


  The schools officially announced a six-game men's basketball series last year that is scheduled to start this December at the Sprint Center in Kansas City.


   


  Two games in the six-year annual hoops series will take place at the Sprint Center, with the other being the final contest agreed to as of now in 2025. A pair of games at Mizzou Arena and Lawrence's Allen Fieldhouse, respectively, are scheduled from 2021-24.


   


  Missouri and Kansas haven't faced off in football or men's basketball in an official capacity since the Tigers departed the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference in 2012.


   


  The Jayhawks defeated the Tigers in a men's basketball preseason exhibition in 2017 in Kansas City.


   


  "Hopefully this renewal on the hardwood will lead to more opportunities down the road in other sports, too," Sterk said of the rivalry in October. "Rivalries make college sports great, and there is no question that when Missouri and Kansas face off in any sport, it's important to a lot of people."


   


  The last gridiron showdown between the schools was Nov. 26, 2011 -- a 24-10 Missouri victory.


   


  The football teams met for 91 straight seasons from 1919 to 2011, as the 1918 flu pandemic canceled the game that year. Missouri and Kansas played on the gridiron every year from 1891 to 1917 as well.


   


  Missouri leads the all-time football series 57-54-9.


   


  "It goes back for generations and it's going to continue to go to generations forward," former MU football coach Barry Odom said about the rivalry. "It's something that I think would benefit our student-athletes, the experience that they have in college, and it also would be great for both fan bases. ... I mean, you live in Missouri, that's what you want. I'm sure you talk to the people over there, that's what they want."


   


  Missouri football has its schedule completely filled through 2025, with games tentatively set for as late as 2035. Plans could always be moved around, but multiple nonconference games have been announced for each season through 2032.


   


  Missouri is scheduled to face former Big 12 foes such as Kansas State and Colorado over the next decade.


   


  The Tigers are also primed to face Illinois eight times between 2026-35.


   


  Arguably the most notable football meeting between Missouri and Kansas was dubbed "Armageddon at Arrowhead" in 2007, when the Tigers defeated the Jayhawks with both teams ranked in the top three in the country.

But trust can't happen overnight — it must be earned, especially between two people who have such a complicated history.


  The summer ends, but Sidney and Asher's story doesn't. There are still too many unresolved issues, too many loose ends still untied. Will their paths cross again in college?

  The number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the country has crossed 8000 with 259 fatalities so far.


  However, it remained unclear whether the board will formally announce the postponement before April 15, the date till which the event was pushed back last month.


  "Three states Punjab, Maharashtra and Karnataka have already said that they are extending lockdown. It is implied that IPL can't happen for the time being. But it will certainly not be cancelled. It will be postponed indefinitely," a BCCI official told PTI on the condition of anonymity.


  The IPL was originally scheduled to be held between March 29 and May 24, but was postponed initially till April 15 due to the coronavirus outbreak.


  "We can't cancel IPL as it means losses to the tune of Rs 3000 crore. The BCCI will work with all stakeholders to find a solution but for that normalcy needs to return. It's not possible for BCCI bigwigs to commit that IPL can happen at which particular slot," he added.


  As of now, there are two options -- organising it in September and early October before the World T20 in Australia or hosting it at the expense of the World T20 if the ICC, Cricket Australia and other stakeholders agree.


  "There are lot of ifs and buts at the moment. You can only have a meaningful discussion when things normalise. Till then, nothing can be said."

When Africa's first case of coronavirus was detected in Egypt in February, the rest of the continent prepared for the brunt of a pandemic that has engulfed Europe and spread to the United States, infecting more than 1.6 million worldwide.Health experts warned of the devastation the deadly virus could cause in Africa, where most hospitals are desperately short of equipment and trained staff. Coronavirus has since spread to 52 African countries, but despite a steady rise in the number of confirmed cases, the continent continues to lag behind the global curve for infections and deaths.Still, the World Health Organization last month warned Africa faced a dramatic evolution of the pandemic even as governments imposed restrictions to help curb the spread. The continent appears poorly equipt to manage a major health crisis and is struggling to test enough to monitor virus cases. Where does Africa stand?To date the novel respiratory disease has infected more than 12,800 people on the continent and killed at least 692, according to a tally compiled by AFP. Only the Comoros archipelago and the tiny kingdom of Lesotho have not yet detected any cases.South Africa is the worst-affected country, with over 2,000 confirmed cases and 24 recorded deaths so far -- well behind the more than 871,000 cases and 71,000 deaths counted in Europe to date. Experts, however, warn that the tide is rising."During the last four days we can see that the numbers have already doubled," said Michel Yao, the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa's emergency response programme manager."If the trend continues... some countries may face a huge peak very soon," Yao told AFP.WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti echoed the concern, adding that the spread of COVID-19 outside major cities opened "a new front in our fight against this virus".Are numbers underestimated?Possibly the greatest question mark in analyses of coronavirus in Africa, compounded by a global lack of testing capacity.Despite a donation of more than one million coronavirus testing kits by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, most African countries lack the equipment needed to detect the disease.South Africa -- which has the most advanced healthcare system in sub-Saharan Africa -- has so far only managed to test around 73,000 of its 57 million inhabitants. "This is way too low for the kind of challenges South Africa is facing," said the country's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, who is aiming to scale up to 30,000 tests per day.Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, has only carried out 5,000 coronavirus tests to date for a country of 190 million people."The testing system is quite overloaded," admitted a doctor working at a private clinic in Lagos, who asked not to be identified."It takes time for... the results," he added. "And are they accurate? We don't know."Inability to test for the virus has forced several countries to work with vague and sometimes misleading estimates. Kenya, for instance, has predicted its number of coronavirus cases to reach 10,000 by the end of April.Ten days into the month, the number of detected infections remained lower than 200."The reason is we have not gone to do community-based testing," explained the Director General of Kenya's health ministry, Patrick Amoth."So we still stand by our earlier projections. We don't know what is going to happen."The head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, admitted that Africa's coronavirus statistics were far from "perfect"."We just lack the means," he told AFP.But Nkengasong also dismissed claims that a high number of infections had slipped under the radar, pointing out that hospitals "would be flooded with people" if that was the case. Have lockdowns, curfews worked? The delayed spread of coronavirus gave African countries some leeway to roll out the same measures implemented in Europe to stem the disease. Governments across the continent reacted ahead of time, closing borders and imposing lockdowns and curfews when just a handful of cases had been detected. Those measures have been tricky to enforce in impoverished and densely populated neighbourhoods, where houses are overcrowded and most survive off informal work -- making it almost impossible to remain home.The WHO's Moeti cautioned that it was "too early to say" whether anti-coronavirus measures were slowing the epidemic in Africa.Meanwhile, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said earlier this week that there was "sufficient evidence" to show that a nation-wide lockdown was "working"."In the two weeks before the lockdown, the average daily increase in new cases was around 42 percent. Since the start of the lockdown, the average daily increase has been around 4 percent," Ramaphosa said on Thursday, as he announced an extension of the 21-day shutdown. Has Africa had enough time to prepare?The time gained by African governments could be offset by a lack of means."There is a severe shortage of treatment facilities for critical cases of Covid-19," said a WHO statement. There are barely five intensive care unit beds per one million people in Africa, compared to 4,000 in Europe, according to the organisation.Public hospitals only have 2,000 medical ventilators between them to serve the whole continent. Still no one dares make any predictions on the proportions the novel coronavirus could reach in Africa.The WHO noted that 31 countries on the continent had less than 100 confirmed cases and believed "containment was possible".Yet the threat remains."Covid-19 has the potential to cause thousands of deaths," said the WHO's Moeti. "To also unleash economic and social devastation."

Pune The Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has upended daily life throughout the city. The waste and recycling industry's essential services continue, but for frontline workers it is no longer business as usual. For Pune-based Swach (Solid waste collection and handling- a cooperative of self- employed waste collectors) which has a team of 3,500 sanitation workers on ground, less number of safety kits containing masks,gloves and other essential items, is a major worry.According to Harshad Barde, director, Swach, the organisation has 95 per cent of its staff on ground. Though the access to sealed areas is limited, garbage collection from other areas is fully functioning."The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has provided us with 6,500 gloves, masks and soaps and are also making arrangements for additional 35,000 soaps (10 per member). We also have 7,000 gloves and scarves (2 per member) which we received from another organisation.However, these resources are not sufficient," said Barde.In the coming months, Swach members will need six gloves per member, that is 21,000 gloves, 70,000 soaps (2 per member) and 7,000 scarves (2 per member) in order to remain safe, according to Barde.Though the PMC is trying to procure more safety kits, Swach has appealed for assistance from individuals and groups too for gloves and masks.The masks that the Swach workers wear are washable. For Mangal Gaikwad who works in Kotbagi lane in Aundh, mask is a new thing,however, she wears it duly without fail. "Earlier, we used to wear gloves, but now ever since Cvoid-19, we have been told to wear the mask as well. We have received two of these. Initially it was uncomfortable, but since we have no choice and I don't want to fall sick, I have to wear it,' she said.Kalyani Patil, who oversees the operations across PMC, said, "It is difficult for us to train the waste pickers about Covid-19 in such a short time. We trained the Prabhag (ward) coordinators with help of pamphlets and distributed the same to everyone explaining them the proper ways of sanitising and the importance of wearing masks and gloves. Initially, a lot of them were averse to the idea of masks, but with neighbours and the areas they visited all following protocol, they all began wearing a mask or even a scarf or handkerchief without any complaints."

The first official Fishing Tourney in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is going on right now and can be expected to reoccur regularly throughout each season. So what exactly does this first exciting event entail? Unlike past entries this isn't a contest about catching the rarest, largest or most valuable fish. Instead it's a contest that can be continually completed for multiple rewards along the way. Speaking with C.J. in the plaza will begin the event, wherein players have 3 minutes to catch as many fish as they can. The bare minimum goal should be 3, as that earns good points right off the bat. After the 3 minutes are up, returning to CJ will reward points and the ability to sell the fish if desired in the cooler.

  The almost 3 mile long Ocean City Boardwalk is the perfect place to go for a walk or a bike ride, never failing to entertain. From 1900, there has been some form of Boardwalk in Ocean City. The original Boardwalk was lifted at the end of every summer, and, like the boogie boards and beach towels of today, put away until needed the following year. By 1910, the Boardwalk was permanent, running just five blocks but expanding to 15th street by the 1920's.  Visitors continued to enjoy the Boards through the following decades, and in the '40's and '50's, dressing up to promenade along the narrow boards was something of a tradition. On hot days, it was possible to sit underneath the raised Boardwalk to shelter from the sun, and many a local child would spend their evenings looking for lost change at the end of the day, under the Boardwalk. The Boardwalk fell victim to the great storm of 1962, but it was rebuilt to the Boardwalk we recognize today, which now ends at 27th Street.

Truth be told, I seriously doubt whether colleges will even open for the fall semester—at least with students in attendance. People seize onto any sign that the end is in sight: the news last night mentioned "the light at the end of the tunnel". But I see not an iota of evidence for that, only a lot of wishful thinking. I hope I'm wrong, but what I see are futile attempts to restart the economy, more flareups of the virus, more subsequent lockdowns (perhaps local ones), and a recurring cycle that will sap the strength and will of not only business people, but of all of us.

The US embassy in China issued a security alert on Saturday for African- Americans living and working in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou after several reports said members of the large black community in the city were being targeted and harassed amid Covid-19 fears.


  Diplomats from several African countries have also taken up the matter of their citizens being harassed with the Chinese embassies.


  Reports of Africans being targeted in Guangzhou comes in the backdrop of rising number of imported Covid-19 cases in China.
