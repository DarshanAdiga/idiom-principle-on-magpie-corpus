The shopping period can likely make or break Q4 GDP, but there’s more to it than simply buying gifts. With travel expected to be way down because of the virus, other parts of the economy like airlines, cruise ships, casinos, and restaurants could continue to sputter even if people spend more on presents. And the real reckoning might come in mid-January when consumers start to get those credit card bills in the mail, especially if there’s no government stimulus by then.

The ballot counting process is transparent. Many states live-streamed the rooms where ballots were being sorted, verified and counted. As vote counts are certified from now until Dec. 10, Americans can take heart in knowing the results are accurate.
 It was also obvious from results here in Minnesota and across the country that voters continue to pursue independent and vote-splitting trends. Despite a strong victory here for Joe Biden and Sen. Tina Smith, Republicans not only held their ground in legislative races, they picked up seats in the State House as well as flipped a Congressional seat. The predicted “Blue Wave” did not happen. Yet no one is questioning those results as inaccurate.
 Certainly, there can be issues – a worker making an innocent mistake perhaps, or the rare actual intent by someone to defraud. In Minnesota since 2015, a total of 10 cases of illegal voting were upheld, according to the election fraud database of the conservative group The Heritage Foundation. These tiny numbers do not change the course of any election and uphold our belief that our system is reliable. (For comparison, California with its much larger population had 22 since 2015 and Republican stronghold Texas had 26.)
 We need to trust the process – and the people who conduct our elections – and when all is done, we should all take comfort that every legal vote has been recorded and any fraudulent ballot has been eliminated. Some will remain disappointed their candidate did indeed lose; others will celebrate victory.
 Our friends and neighbors will come through again – and another lawful, accurate and trustworthy election will be in our rearview mirror.

As well as throwing into turmoil the vacation plans of many British families, the government's sudden changes have rocked the travel industry.
 Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the industry association Airlines U.K., said the announcement on a shorter quarantine period provided “light at the end of the tunnel” for the aviation industry and people wanting to go on holiday.
 Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the travel trade group Abta, said the new testing scheme should make overseas travel “more attractive and manageable for both holidaymakers and business travelers.”
 The government also announced new financial support for English airports and ground handling firms beginning in 2021.
 “This new package of support for airports, alongside a new testing regime for international arrivals, will help the sector take off once again as we build back better from the pandemic," said Treasury chief Rishi Sunak.

Her fictional characters stay at The Palace Hotel, enjoy coffee at Café Dawn, shop at J2 Softwear and get haircuts at Bangs Salon, among other places.
 While the book and characters are purely fictional she almost has you watching out for her very realistic characters on the streets of Salida.
 Folks like Dylan Cox, the Chicago detective who comes to Salida to investigate the disappearance of six-year-old Trip Stewart, the son of Cox’s egotistical artist cousin, Nate Stewart, who owns a local gallery.
 Some of the characters you quickly come to love – others you want to slap upside the head.
 The series centers around sightings of a sasquatch who is believed, at least by some, to be responsible for several deaths in Salida and possibly the disappearance of young Trip Stewart.
 The town is divided with the sasquatch believers and non-believers at odds over the likelihood the beast really exists.
 While the book is set in Salida, the author has a personal rule that bad things like death and other harm can’t happen in real places so you may notice a few places that don’t exist.
 Her character development is excellent, with the reader quickly feeling he/she “knows” these people.
 In reviewing Ditchkus’s books, I intended to read the first and stop there but the writing is so well researched and descriptions and plots are so excellent that I was quickly drawn into the second book and now the third. A fourth is in the works.
 I would compare the writing of L.V. Ditchkus to that of my literary hero, Stephen King and that says a lot.
 Chapters are short but each one ends in a cliffhanger, leaving the reader turning pages and going on to the next and the next.
 Is there a sasquatch in Salida? Or is is some other unworldly thing – or maybe even something human – terrorizing this peaceful valley? I don’t know. But I plan to keep on reading and find out.
 The Sasquatch Series is available at The Book Haven and on Amazon.com and sells for $16 per book.

The thrill of plummeting to earth from 70 feet high, being twisted upside down at high speeds, and the sweet scent of cotton candy and baked pretzels can be experienced only at a great American Theme Park.  There is truly nothing I enjoy more than a full day of exhilarating rollercoaster rides, screaming while travelling rapidly in multiple directions, my stomach churning with fear and excitement.
 The one and only good thing about this despicable virus, is that theme parks can only operate at a limited capacity, which means little or no lines for rides. A true dream for a thrill seeker! Over the summer, I ventured across state to Hershey Park for a day trip. Whilst driving into town you can smell hints of chocolate in the air, which makes for a fantastic start to the day. Once parked, it was a breeze entering into the Park and making our way to the first ride, which was only a ten-minute line wait. The limit on people in the park is fantastic, although it does cut down on the hub of energy. One some rides, once you step off, you can get back on after a couple of minutes. That used to be unheard of! Masks have to be worn at all times in the park, which makes screaming on rides not as enjoyable. However, at the Waterpark, masks are not needed, and everyone is playing in close proximity to each other in pools and on slides as if there was no virus. That was probably the scariest part of the park. After a short terrifying trip to the water park, I was determined to fit in a few more rides to end the day. The rapid drop at Skyrush and the crazy twists and turns at Fahrenheit had me holding on for dear life; the fear makes you feel so alive. To top it all off, I was in the land of chocolate, therefore as an extra treat to end the day, I bought a bunch of candy and fudge so that the memories and joy could last past one glorious day.
  I wanted to take my next theme park excursion on Halloween, where I envisioned trick or treating around the park, and scary creatures popping out of bushes in the spirit of the holiday. Unfortunately, trick or treating was cancelled this year, and besides one scary clown at night, there weren't any dressed up staff at Six Flags in Maryland. I was so excited for this Halloween adventure that I dressed according to theme, in a scary clown costume and put on my make up for the part. Little did I know that I was the only one of my friends to dress up. It was too cold to not wear my coat the whole time, and when we arrived at Six Flags, I was told to my dismay that I had to take off the makeup on half my face for reasons unbeknownst to anyone. Nevertheless, the sun was shining, and I strode with my half face into the park.
 We started off on the baby rides, which are just almost as amusing as the big boy rides. We joined little babies with their parents on the Merry Go Round and got a few stares from children and parents when we screamed on the baby rollercoaster. After the child's play was over we scurried towards the larger rides, where we went in a continuous loop, dropped from hundreds of feet high, flew through the air at speeds over 60mph and became queasy from whirling around in tea cups.
 After many rides, and the sun fading, I still wanted to experience the best ride saved for last, the Superman. There was only one trolley very the line moved so slowly, and it was starting to get cold and dark quickly, but I was sure the deadly drop would be worth the frigid wait. As soon as I reached the ride, I hopped on eagerly, ready for the most exhilarating minute. I could hear the chatter of excitement and fear behind me as the wheels of the trolley rolled high up and came to a complete stop. Silence. For one short breath nothing could be heard at the top. I looked down to see my friends hundreds of feet below, pointing and staring up. And then, in the blink of an eye, they were out of sight and I was flying down rapidly. I could feel my body drift slowly up from my seat as I gripped the handles tightly. My long hair was flying in the gush of wind blowing upwards. I brushed it aside and looked down at the track and pavement below. I heard the screams of the passengers sitting behind me and along with them I started to shout as well, lifting my arms from the handlebars. The speed of the trolley grew faster as we plummeted downwards headfirst. Then suddenly the trolley turned abruptly upwards and twisted. I was hanging upside down for a split second, completely off my seat, only held together by a hard plastic restraint. Before I could take a breath, the cart flew back down sideways and upside down. And then, as quickly as the trolley dropped, it came to a halt and turned horizontally back on the ground. Perfect end to a whirlwind of a day.

“Concern remains that we could exceed (intensive care unit) capacity if people increase their contact with others during the next few weeks over the Thanksgiving holiday and beyond,” Dr. Jonathan Samet, dean of the Colorado School of Public Health wrote. “This is not the year to celebrate with extended family or friends – stick close to home and spend the holiday with those in your own household.”
 While COVID-19 numbers in Chaffee County held steady Monday, 16 cases were reported during the weekend, bringing the county’s pandemic total to 573.
 Colorado Department of Corrections reported 30 additional cases of COVID-19 among inmates at Buena Vista Correctional Complex, bringing the pandemic total to 261. At this time, 33 inmates are listed as active cases.
 CDPHE currently lists the correctional complex as an active outbreak site.
 Statewide, the number of COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic topped 200,000 Monday as the total hit 202,289 cases with the addition of 3,519 new cases.
 With the recent upsurge in the number of cases across the state, a major concern is hospital capacity as more cases potentially means more hospitalizations and the threat of exceeding hospital capacities.
 Monday Gov. Jared Polis issued an executive order authorizing Colorado public health “to order hospitals and freestanding emergency departments to transfer or cease the admission of patients to respond to the current disaster emergency due to COVID-19 in Colorado within the requirements of federal law.”

According to the Small Business Administration, when you shop locally, 70 percent of spending stays in the local economy, whereas only 40 percent remains when shopping non-locally. This means if you spend $100, your community keeps $70.
 This increases local tax revenues used to support schools, police, fire stations, roads and more.
 Local businesses also utilize other local businesses such as marketing, accounting and printing, further impacting the local economy.
 “The main foundation of it all is that when you shop local, small businesses thrive. And when small businesses are thriving, a number of things happen: Number one, the obvious thing, is that when you’re giving your money to a local business, those dollars stay in the community and they recycle, so to speak.
 The small business owners then invest in other local businesses and the dollars don’t disappear to some big corporation halfway across the country,” said Jon Frykholm, who owns Little Elk Trading Company on East Main Street with his wife Annie.
 The Frykholms also create the furniture and artwork sold in their store.
 “Then, when you invest in small businesses, they go and create local jobs,” he said.
 Little Elk moved from Summit County to Main Street a little more than a year ago and since then, Frykholm said the Buena Vista community has welcomed them “with open arms.
 “We have felt tremendous support from the community through this year. There have been many people who have been deliberately shopping local, and that’s been huge for us to help keep us in business,” Frykholm said. “When things really finally turn around and get going again, we’re going to be hiring more help, because we see the potential.”
 Keeping locally-owned small businesses thriving also helps ensure that your local business community is, well, local, and the town keeps a unique, independent identity.
 “More entrepreneurs are drawn to the community, and it begins to offer an unique character for our community,” Frykholm said.
 Contrary to early concerns, once state stay at home orders were lifted, Buena Vista experienced a busy, lucrative summer season.
 “If you just look at the numbers on paper, this was an incredibly successful summer, and talking to other businesses, if they were able to figure out a strategy to safely remain open, they did extremely well,” said Matt Wells, co- owner of Black Burro Bikes in Buena Vista’s South Main.
 Now that the golden leaves are long gone from the aspens and the nights are growing longer, the time of the year has come for Buena Vistans to support one another.
 Traynham said the chamber is also preparing to launch websites created in partnership with the Chaffee County Visitors Bureau “that will list all the food service options in the county, as well as a retail page for local businesses to promote during the holiday season,” Traynham said.

"There's a disconnect in the community, where we're seeing people at bars and restaurants, or planning Thanksgiving dinners," said Dr. Kelly Cawcutt, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. As health workers, she said, "we feel kind of dejected." All told, COVID-19 has claimed more than 256,000 lives in the United States. The virus' mortality rate has dropped as doctors have learned more about the disease, and vaccines developed by Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and others could hit the market early next year. In the meantime, smaller hospitals say they are employing the same drugs - such as remdesivir and dexamethasone - that big-city facilities do, but don't have the same access to ICU equipment or specialized expertise.

As our country works to rebound, we're helping you manage the pressure as the pandemic is shifting caregiving responsibilities.
 More millennials are taking on this responsibility now. They're becoming a greater percentage of what's known as the "sandwich generation." Those are people who are caring for both their own kids and their aging parents.
 New numbers from insurance company New York Life show a third of millennials are doing this now.
 “We're not replacing the typical 49-year-old woman who's the family caregiver. She's still doing it, but the need is so great that more and more young people are called into the role as well and that's going to continue well after the COVID pandemic,” said John Schall, CEO of the Caregiver Action Network.
 Nearly half of the so-called "sandwich generation" expect to be a caregiver in some capacity for six or more years.
 The added financial strain is one concern. Schall says out of pocket expenses can be about a thousand dollars a month.
 More than half of these caregivers say they're spending more than usual per month to care for others as a result of the pandemic. That means they're contributing less to their savings and their retirement.
 There's also the concern about the mental toll.
 “With millennial generation caregivers, you may not be thinking about depression, you know, at that age, but the fact is the sheer stress of the role of being a family caregiver increases that risk of depression twice as often,” said Schall.
 If you are feeling overwhelmed, the caregiver help desk from the Caregiver Action Network can be one place to turn. You can call them free of charge at 855-227-3640.

ARLINGTON, Va., Nov. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The DLBA Division of Gibbs & Cox is excited to announce that we will be supporting DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO) on their revolutionary No Manning Required, Ship (NOMARS) Program. The program will design, build, and field test an unmanned surface ship that can operate autonomously for long durations at sea with no human interventions or underway maintenance. Our team was selected by DARPA to explore the trade space for clean-sheet vessel designs developed without any provision for crew on board. The intent of this effort is to create a paradigm shift in the design of marine surface vehicles as we transition from manned to unmanned platforms, while leveraging newly established and developmental technologies to increase capability, increase reliability, and reduce total ownership cost.

 Roby said: “Jammer hasn’t changed - he was always big, aggressive and angry and what you see is that you get. He always stood out as a youngster, he was always the star player when we played against them and we knew we had to get stuck into him.
 “He carried that all the way through his junior years, and getting to know him when we growing up, he’s just a fantastic bloke and a little bit different as well.
 “He has a unique blend - he’s a scouser but his dad’s Cumbrian and it all adds to his personality. It’s been a privilege and an honour to play alongside him.”

Gulliford has made an impact on both teams since her freshman year. As a sophomore, Gulliford earned all-state honorable mentions in both sports. Last year as a junior, she earned all-state second team in both sports.
 “Koy has made an impact since her first game her freshman year,” Thornton said. “With her height and skills, teams have to account for her at all times. She impacts a game at both ends of the floor. Her defensive presence forces teams to think twice before going inside, and she can shoot from anywhere on the floor so they have to come out on her. Koy’s 20 rebounds in our state game against Briggsdale were huge and prove the impact she can have.”
 To do that, however, she also put in a lot of time that most people didn’t see.
 “Koy’s work ethic and team first attitude is what makes her such a special athlete,” Thornton said. “She is also a natural leader. She’s at every open gym in the off season, and every practice during the season. She stays late to work on her skills. Koy doesn’t care about personal stats. She wants to win above all else and is willing to sacrifice to reach that goal. Koy just loves to play and compete.”
 And now she’ll get to continue playing and competing.
 Gulliford received a scholarship that is pretty much a full ride, covering her tuition, fees and books. She also earned an academic scholarship.

The general themes of their Thanksgiving plans are adapting, making the best of a challenging situation, and remembering to be thankful.

Pornhub is once again getting in on Black Friday by offering a lifetime membership deal.
 Starting Thursday, Nov. 26 at midnight ET, adult content enthusiasts can grab a Pornhub LifePlan for $200. That's better than last year's $299 offer, and a pretty good deal overall given that Pornhub Premium usually goes for $9.99 a month or $95.88 a year.
 Pornhub said it will only offer a limited number of these lifetime memberships, and as more people purchase them, the price will go up in increments of $25 to $500.
 “Thanksgiving is a time to come together and give thanks for all the wonderful things that have happened during the year, but 2020 has been a challenging year, to say the least,” said Corey Price, VP, Pornhub. “No matter what other surprises 2020 throws our way, having Pornhub Premium for life is the best way to guarantee your year has a happy ending.”
 With Pornhub Premium, subscribers get access to more than 500,000 premium porn videos in addition to the standard Pornhub library. There's also 4K content, video experiences designed for VR headsets, and the video streaming itself promises to be faster. Buyers can also gift a subscription to a friend.
 If you don't want to commit to $200, Pornhub is offering a free, one-week trial for its $9.99-per-month plan, plus 40% off four months of Premium at $4.99 per month.
