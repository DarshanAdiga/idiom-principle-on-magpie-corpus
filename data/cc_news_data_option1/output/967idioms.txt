But many of the more prominent players remain split on the issue, some of them totally adamant about declining the proposal and returning back to the drawing board to look for more revenue concessions. Those players are, seemingly, the vocal minority.

  DETROIT (Reuters) - Joe Biden hopes to take a big step toward the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday when six states cast votes, while Bernie Sanders aims for an upset win in Michigan that would keep his White House hopes alive.


  Biden, who claimed the position of Democratic front-runner with a sweeping series of wins last week in Super Tuesday nominating contests, could build a formidable lead in the race to pick a challenger to President Donald Trump with another round of decisive victories.


  The biggest showdown between Biden and Sanders will take place in Michigan, a political battleground where Sanders sprang a stunning 2016 upset over Hillary Clinton that ensured a long nominating fight - something Biden hopes to avoid this time.


  With 125 delegates, Michigan is the largest prize of the six states voting on Tuesday, when a total of 352 delegates to July's Democratic nominating convention will be up for grabs.


  Missouri, Mississippi, Washington, North Dakota and Idaho also hold nominating contests.


  Since last week's romps on Super Tuesday, Biden has roared into the national lead in polling and delegates, knocked out his remaining viable rivals except Sanders and swept up another wave of endorsements from prominent Democrats and former rivals such as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.


  Democrats who were worried that Sanders' democratic socialist proposals to restructure the economy would doom the party to defeat in the November election have rushed to rally behind Biden, the former vice president under Barack Obama.


  Biden has a double-digit lead in the four most recent polls taken in Michigan. But Clinton held a similar lead in Michigan polls over Sanders, a senator from Vermont, before the 2016 primary, making predictions of the outcome this time even less reliable than usual.


  Like his resounding win in South Carolina that was powered by overwhelming support from African Americans, Biden was again lifted in Super Tuesday contests by strong support from black voters.


  In 2016, about one-fifth of Democratic primary voters in Michigan and Missouri, and an overwhelming 70% in Mississippi, were black.


  VIRTUAL KNOCKOUT OR LONG PRIMARY FIGHT?


  In Michigan, Sanders has pressed his criticism of Biden's past support for global trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade pact is unpopular in Michigan, where it is blamed for costing jobs.


  Biden has countered by recalling the Obama administration's decision to bail out the auto industry, an economic pillar in Michigan, and help its biggest city, Detroit, navigate a municipal bankruptcy.


  Biden is "viewed pretty favourably here. So, it does have that different element compared to 2016," said Steven Rzeppa, the mayor of Trenton, Michigan, an auto industry community south of Detroit, who added Sanders had a stronger organiSation in the state.


  A Biden breakthrough in Michigan, and big victories in Missouri and Mississippi, where he is heavily favoured, would put him in prime position to strike a virtual knockout on Sanders in next week's March 17 contests, when the big states of Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Arizona all cast votes.


  If Biden retains a significant lead in delegates after next week's voting, Sanders will be out of realistic possibilities to catch up. By the end of March, about two-thirds of the delegates up for grabs in the race will be allocated.


  Heading into Tuesday's voting, Biden leads Sanders by 628-545 in pledged delegates, according to Edison Research. A total of 1,991 is needed for the nomination.


  The other big state where Sanders hopes for a win on Tuesday is Washington, which has 89 pledged delegates. Sanders beat Clinton there in 2016, when the state held caucuses, but it has switched to a primary this year and recent polls show a close race.


  Idaho and North Dakota, with 20 and 14 delegates respectively, also held caucuses in 2016 that went for Sanders. Both states are expected to be more competitive this time.


  Idaho has switched to a primary this year, and North Dakota's contest is called a caucus but functions as a primary, allowing voters to show up at polling sites during an eight-hour window during the day.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Tuesday a 2016 migration deal with the EU needs to be updated in light of the crisis in northern Syria, as tensions continued to flare on the Turkish-Greek border after Ankara said it would no longer to stop migrants trying to cross.


  In an interview with state-owned Anadolu news agency, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that European Union visa liberalisation and an update of the country's customs union with the bloc must be implemented to help solve the migrant issue.


  Late on Monday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan left meetings in Brussels with EU and NATO leaders without issuing a joint statement nor appearing at a joint news conference, as had been planned.


  Erdogan made the trip to Brussels as a dispute deepened over the fate of tens of thousands of migrants trying to enter EU-member Greece. Ankara decided last month to encourage the migration to extract more European support and funding in its military effort in Syria's Idlib region.


  Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian migrants and has stemmed migration to Europe under the 2016 deal in return for billions of euros in aid. But it has become frustrated with what it regards as too little European support over the war in Syria, where its troops faced off against Russian-backed government forces.


  The pact also envisaged the EU taking in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from camps in Turkey, rewarding Turks with visa-free travel to the bloc, faster progress in EU membership talks and upgrading their customs union.

  OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Weary passengers aboard a cruise ship idled at sea for days by a coronavirus outbreak erupted in cheers on Monday as the vessel sailed into San Francisco Bay en route to the Port of Oakland and the next, unexpected phase of their voyage - two weeks of quarantine.


  The 2,400 passengers, who have been largely confined to their staterooms since Thursday, were to begin disembarking on Monday for transport to quarantine stations or hospitals, depending on whether they are well or need immediate medical attention.


  Except for those with acute illness, the 1,100 crew members are to remain aboard the Grand Princess, which will depart the Port of Oakland as soon as possible to be quarantined for two weeks in an as-yet undisclosed location outside San Francisco Bay, officials said.


  Video footage shot by one of the arriving cruise guests and shared with Reuters showed jubilant passengers cheering from their stateroom balconies and open windows, some shouting, "We're home!" as the vessel passed beneath the Golden Gate Bridge into the bay.


  Twenty-one people aboard the ship, mostly crew, tested positive on Friday for coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19, in an initial round of diagnostic screenings performed on about 45 people with symptoms.


  The remaining passengers are to be tested and monitored for signs and symptoms of the illness that can lead to pneumonia once they reach their designated quarantine sites.


  Denise Stoneham, 52, a Bay area resident on the cruise with her husband, seemed to take the ordeal in stride as she spoke to Reuters by Facetime while the ship glided into the port.


  "It hasn't been too much of a hardship for us; it's just been more of an inconvenience, I guess," she said. "We're just anxious to get home."


  Princess Cruises, owner-operator of the ship, announced that passengers would receive a full refund for the price of the cruise, including air travel, hotel, ground transportation and pre-paid shore excursions.


  The company also offered patrons credit for a future cruise equal to the fare paid for the voyage.


  But at least one couple aboard the Grand Princess were seeking more than a refund.


  In what was believed to be the first civil case stemming from the cruise outbreak, Ronald and Eva Weissberger of Broward County, Florida, sued the cruise line for more than $1 million, saying they were traumatized by the fear of developing coronavirus.


  Parent company Carnival Corp, the world's leading cruise operator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


  LINKS TO PREVIOUS CRUISE


  The Grand Princess was first denied entry to San Francisco Bay on Wednesday as it sailed back from Hawaii after state and local health authorities learned that some passengers and crew had developed flu-like symptoms, and that guests from an earlier cruise to Mexico aboard the same ship later tested positive for coronavirus.


  Health authorities have said at least two, including a California man who died, probably contracted the virus aboard the vessel. Since then, a total of 12 coronavirus cases have been linked to the previous Mexico trip.


  California Governor Gavin Newsom had insisted the current cruise be halted and the ship kept at sea until individuals aboard who were sick could be tested, and diagnostic kits were flown to the ocean liner by helicopter on Thursday.


  But it took federal, state and local authorities until Sunday to decide on a return-to-port strategy and quarantine plan for the ship, and to work out logistics of keeping the ship and everyone board isolated from the general public.


  The U.S. Coast Guard flew medical teams to the vessel on Sunday to assess the health of passengers and crew ahead of their arrival.


  Under plans announced on Sunday, California residents were to go to two existing quarantine sites near Sacramento and San Diego. Out-of-state residents will be transported to two quarantine stations in Texas and Georgia.


  Newsom said on Sunday the government was arranging to repatriate foreign cruise passengers by charter flights to their home countries. He said they would be ferried on special buses to a non-commercial terminal at Oakland International Airport.


  The Port of Oakland, located across San Francisco Bay from the vessel's home berth, was chosen because it was one of the few in the region able to accommodate a large cruise liner and was deemed relatively easy to seal off while passengers are unloaded and moved elsewhere, Newsom said.


  Princess Cruises also owns the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined off Japan in February and was for a time the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside of China, where the outbreak originated. About 700 people aboard that ship became infected, and six have died.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday the government would soon announce a package to stimulate an economy hammered by the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, but did not give financial details of the plan.


  "Our objective is this - keep people in jobs, keep businesses in business, and ensure we bounce back stronger on the other side," Morrison said at the Australian Financial Review conference in Sydney.


  "We must favour measures that will lift productivity to enable the Australian economy to sustain an even stronger growth trajectory than we were on prior to the crisis."


  The prime minister said the impacts from the coronavirus outbreak were "potentially greater" than the global financial crisis of 2008, and the stimulus package would be geared to meet the "unique nature" of the challenge from the virus outbreak.


  A report in the Australian newspaper on Monday said the Australian government was planning measures worth about A$10 billion (5.04 billion pounds) to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus, abandoning plans for a budget surplus in the current fiscal year.


  The coronavirus has killed about 3,900 people across the globe, with three deaths in Australia. Stock markets have plunged, prompting central banks to ease monetary policies.


  The virus has wreaked havoc on the tourism and education sectors, both big money spinners for Australia, with the Treasury department estimating that the epidemic will cut 0.5 percentage points off economic growth in the first quarter.


  Morrison also said big businesses in the country should step up and assist the government in its economic recovery efforts.


  "We need you to support your workers by keeping them employed. Whenever possible, support them. Full-time, part-time, casual, including with paid leave if they need to take time off during the course of the virus," he said.

In a massive setback for the Congress, its prominent youth leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party and appeared set to join BJP Tuesday amid a rebellion in Madhya Pradesh by his supporters, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse. A shell-shocked Congress, in a largely symbolic move of no consequence, expelled Scindia, the party general secretary and scion of the erstwhile Gwalior royal family, on charges of anti- party activities.


  On Tuesday morning, as much of India was celebrating Holi, Scindia met senior BJP leader and Home Minister Amit Shah, following which he called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence. There was no official word on what transpired at the meetings. However, BJP sources asserted that the decision of the party's top two leaders to hold long deliberations with Scindia underlined the importance they attach to him. In the resignation letter dated March 9 to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Scindia said "it is now time for me to move on" as he was unable to serve the people of the country while remaining in the party.


  The Congress party said his letter was received at Sonia Gandhi's residence only at 12.20 pm on Tuesday. With Scindia quitting the party, the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh appeared headed for a collapse as the former Guna MP has the support of at least 17 legislators.


  The Congress has a wafer-thin majority in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly whose current effective strength is 228. If the resignations of the 17 MLAs is accepted, the strength of the Assembly will fall to 211. The magic number for retaining the majority then will be 106. The Congress, however, will be left with 97 seats while the BJP has 104 seats. The Congress has the support of four Independents, two BSP and one SP MLA, but is unclear if they will continue to support Congress or go with BJP Noting that the events of the day had been drawing themselves out for a year, Scindia, in his letter to Gandhi, said it was now best for him to look at a fresh start. "Having been a primary member of the Congress party for the last 18 years. It is now time for me to move on. I am tendering my resignation from the primary membership of the Congress and as you well know this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year," Scindia wrote in the letter. "While my aim and purpose remains the same as it has always been from the very beginning, to serve the people of my state and my country, I believe I am unable to do this anymore within this party," Scindia said in his resignation letter posted on Twitter. "To reflect and realise the aspirations of my people and workers I believe it is best that I now look ahead at a fresh start," he said.


  The former Guna MP also thanked Gandhi and his other former Congress colleagues for "providing him with a platform to have served the nation". Soon thereafter, a statement from AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the Congress president has "approved the expulsion of Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Indian National Congress with immediate effect for anti-party activities." Meanwhile in Bhopal, 14 Congress MLAs loyal to Scindia sent their resignations to Madhya Pradesh Governor Lal Ji Tandon, Raj Bhavan sources said. Scindia, once considered a rising star of the party, has long been at loggerheads with Kamal Nath who belongs to the old guard. After narrowly winning the state Assembly elections in December 2018, Kamal Nath took over as chief minister.


  But trouble started brewing recently when Scindia's supporters in the government were side-lined, and it appeared that his ambitions to be the state Congress president were also thwarted. It was also clear that the central leadership was not ready to listen to his grievances. This weekend, Scindia and six ministers in the Kamal Nath Cabinet went to Bengaluru and became incommunicado. It then became clear that a rebellion was brewing in the party and Kamal Nath would lose the support of the six ministers as well as other MLAs loyal to Scindia. Kamal Nath on Tuesday wrote to Governor Tandon seeking immediate removal of six ministers who belonged to Scindia's camp. The outcome of the political drama being played out on Holi day goes beyond Madhya Pradesh, which itself is important for both the BJP and the Congress. MP was one of the three major states where the Congress evicted BJP in the series of Assembly elections before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. With the imminent loss of Madhya Pradesh, it will become clear that the Congress leadership has failed to keep a cohesive united front and has been unable to control the conflicting ambitions of its many regional leaders. Continued infighting is likely to further debilitate the party, which is already a pale shadow of its former greatness at the national level. Regaining Madhya Pradesh will greatly enhance BJP's strength in the Hindi belt, and Congress will have only Punjab and Rajasthan, where again it is beset with factional feuds, as the major states under its control. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said joining hands with BJP at a time of "national crisis" speaks volumes about Scindia's "self-indulgent" ambitions. He added that people like Scindia prove they cannot thrive without power, and the sooner they leave the better.


  Another Congress leader, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, also slammed Scindia, saying it "is sad news for the Congress party". "He had been entrusted with important jobs by the party. But now the situation had come to such a pass that he found it more convenient to switch over to the other party," Chowdhury told PTI.


  "Some sort of allurement, enticement offered by the BJP had convinced him for switching over," Chowdhury said. "Now he has become the asset of the BJP party." PTI SKC MPB VJ VJ.

Sources said 20 Congress MLAs from Scindias camp have sent in their resignations -- 19 by email to Raj Bhavan and one, Bisahulal Singh in a hard copy letter.The Congress has a wafer-thin majority in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly whose current effective strength is 228. If the resignations of the 20 MLAs is accepted, the strength of the Assembly will fall to 208. The magic number for retaining the majority then will be 105. The Congress, however, will be left with 94 seats while the BJP has 104 seats. The Congress has the support of four Independents, two BSP and one SP MLA. Even with their support, Congress will fall sort of a majority, and it is anyway unclear if they will continue to support Congress or go with BJP Noting that the events of the day had been drawing themselves out for a year, Scindia, in his letter to Gandhi, said it was now best for him to look at a fresh start. Having been a primary member of the Congress party for the last 18 years. It is now time for me to move on. I am tendering my resignation from the primary membership of the Congress and as you well know this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year, Scindia wrote in the letter. While my aim and purpose remains the same as it has always been from the very beginning, to serve the people of my state and my country, I believe I am unable to do this anymore within this party, Scindia said in his resignation letter posted on Twitter. To reflect and realise the aspirations of my people and workers I believe it is best that I now look ahead at a fresh start, he said.The former Guna MP also thanked Gandhi and his other former Congress colleagues for providing him with a platform to have served the nation. Soon thereafter, a statement from AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the Congress president has approved the expulsion of Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Indian National Congress with immediate effect for anti-party activities. Meanwhile in Bhopal, 14 Congress MLAs loyal to Scindia sent their resignations to Madhya Pradesh Governor Lal Ji Tandon, Raj Bhavan sources said. Scindia, once considered a rising star of the party, has long been at loggerheads with Kamal Nath who belongs to the old guard. After narrowly winning the state Assembly elections in December 2018, Kamal Nath took over as chief minister.But trouble started brewing recently when Scindias supporters in the government were side-lined, and it appeared that his ambitions to be the state Congress president were also thwarted. It was also clear that the central leadership was not ready to listen to his grievances. This weekend, Scindia and six ministers in the Kamal Nath Cabinet went to Bengaluru and became incommunicado. It then became clear that a rebellion was brewing in the party and Kamal Nath would lose the support of the six ministers as well as other MLAs loyal to Scindia. Kamal Nath on Tuesday wrote to Governor Tandon seeking immediate removal of six ministers who belonged to Scindias camp. The outcome of the political drama being played out on Holi day goes beyond Madhya Pradesh, which itself is important for both the BJP and the Congress. MP was one of the three major states where the Congress evicted BJP in the series of Assembly elections before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. With the imminent loss of Madhya Pradesh, it will become clear that the Congress leadership has failed to keep a cohesive united front and has been unable to control the conflicting ambitions of its many regional leaders. Continued infighting is likely to further debilitate the party, which is already a pale shadow of its former greatness at the national level. Regaining Madhya Pradesh will greatly enhance BJPs strength in the Hindi belt, and Congress will have only Punjab and Rajasthan, where again it is beset with factional feuds, as the major states under its control. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said joining hands with BJP at a time of national crisis speaks volumes about Scindias self-indulgent ambitions. He added that people like Scindia prove they cannot thrive without power, and the sooner they leave the better.Another Congress leader, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, also slammed Scindia, saying it is sad news for the Congress party. He had been entrusted with important jobs by the party. But now the situation had come to such a pass that he found it more convenient to switch over to the other party, Chowdhury told PTI.Some sort of allurement, enticement offered by the BJP had convinced him for switching over, Chowdhury said. Now he has become the asset of the BJP party. PTI SKC MPB VJ VJ.

In a massive setback for the Congress, its prominent youth leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party and appeared set to join BJP Tuesday amid a rebellion in Madhya Pradesh by his supporters, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse. A shell-shocked Congress, in a largely symbolic move of no consequence, expelled Scindia, the party general secretary and scion of the erstwhile Gwalior royal family, on charges of anti-party activities.On Tuesday morning, as much of India was celebrating Holi, Scindia met senior BJP leader and Home Minister Amit Shah, following which he called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence. There was no official word on what transpired at the meetings. However, BJP sources asserted that the decision of the partys top two leaders to hold long deliberations with Scindia underlined the importance they attach to him. In the resignation letter dated March 9 to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Scindia said it is now time for me to move on as he was unable to serve the people of the country while remaining in the party.The Congress party said his letter was received at Sonia Gandhis residence only at 12.20 pm on Tuesday. With Scindia quitting the party, the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh appeared headed for a collapse as the former Guna MP has the support of at least 17 legislators.The Congress has a wafer-thin majority in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly whose current effective strength is 228. If the resignations of the 17 MLAs is accepted, the strength of the Assembly will fall to 211. The magic number for retaining the majority then will be 106.

Whirling, spinning, reaching, grasping - Japanese wheelchair dancer Kenta Kambaras emotive performances are wordless testimony to artistic passion and possibility. Born with spina bifida, a disorder that paralyzed his lower body, Kambara aims to perform at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics opening or closing ceremonies, seeking to send a message to disabled and able-bodied people alike its OK to be different.If you cant walk with your legs, its OK to walk with your hands. If there is something you want to do but cannot, its OK to find another way, Kambara, 34, a computer systems engineer and father of a two-year-old daughter, told Reuters. These days, people use the keyword diversity but not many people have experienced it themselves, he said. I want people to understand by seeing me dance that its precise because my body is different than it is interesting. Then that will become a trigger to accept other peoples differences.I also want them to think, Wow, thats cool Kambara was in third grade at elementary school in Kobe, western Japan when his mother told him he would never walk.It was a huge shock and I remember crying, he said. But that was the trigger to think about how to confront my disability and find different ways to achieve my goals. Kambara, whose upper body is well-developed from propelling himself with his arms since childhood, began dancing five years ago and less than a year later, performed at the Rio Paralympics closing ceremony.The self-taught Kambaras repertoire includes handstands on his wheelchair, serpentine moves of his lean, muscular arms and slender fingers, and dizzying spins on a collapsed wheelchair, itself an integral part of his performances. Id already come to terms with my disability before I began dancing so its not as if dancing saved me. But before I started dancing, I often felt my wheelchair was cumbersome in my daily life ... But when it comes to dancing, I feel my use of a wheelchair makes it unique, he said.Disabilities have a negative image, but when it comes to dancing, this is something only I can do. Although he had long tended to hide his paralyzed legs out of embarrassment, that feeling changes when he dances.What I had been hiding becomes something unique that moves peoples hearts, he said. Kambara also performs and lectures at schools, where youngsters are impressed.I thought it was amazing that someone born with a disability could do such an intense, cool dance, said eight-year-old elementary school student Konatsu Matsuo. Before I thought being in a wheelchair was tough, she said. Now I think that life with a wheelchair can be fun.Besides aiming for the Paralympics ceremonies, Kambara harbors a bigger dream - to dance at the Olympics closing ceremony as a way to boost interest in the Paralympic Games. There shouldnt be a division such that if you are disabled, you can only perform at the Paralympics, he said but noted that in contrast to the Paralympics, there are no open auditions for the Olympics ceremonies. The results of the Paralympics auditions are expected by the end of March.Speculation, denied by organizers, is swirling that the Games might be canceled due to the global spread of the novel coronavirus, but Kambara said he was not discouraged. Even if the Games are canceled, I will have another chance to stand on a world stage, he said.

Mr. Tsikata, continued working very hard despite the rejection, to ensure that Zambia got the deal before he retired, just like his home country had done, but all to no avail, until he retired. The economic merits of the deal were just as compelling then, as they are today,but for some reason, Zambia rejected the deal. And today, we are going cap in hand for the same. Zambia‚Äôs economic problems today, are largely a result of politics driving economic policy and people with little knowledge about the economic consequences of certain decisions influencing and/or taking decisions. There is just too much uninformed decision making taking place in our country resulting in unforced errors or own goals to use the tennis and football metaphors, and its the innocent citizens that are suffering the resulting hardships.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The city of Berlin will take in 80 to 100 children from Greek refugee camps, the German capital's senator for interior affairs told broadcaster RTL on Tuesday.


  European politicians are struggling to agree on what to do about tens of thousands of migrants trying to enter EU-member Greece since Ankara said last month it would no longer keep them.


  German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition parties said on Monday they were ready to take in several hundred children from Greek camps together with other EU countries. They said they would target children who were sick or younger than 14 and unaccompanied.


  Asked when the children could arrive in the Berlin, interior affairs senator Andreas Geisel told the broadcaster: "It now depends on how quickly the German government implements this decision. I think it's more like today than tomorrow."


  Turkey wants more European support for hosting some 3.6 million refugees from Syria which it agreed to in 2016 in exchange for billions of euros in aid under a deal with the EU to keep a lid on migration to Europe.

Cardoso explained that the common practice of feeding an acidified diet prior to calving forces the cow to manufacture and redistribute calcium from her bones.


  This activation of internal calcium production carries the cow through to lactation, when she resumes consuming calcium in her diet.


   


   


  Producers commonly feed negative dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) diets in the weeks before calving, usually supplemented with a small amount of calcium (1% of dry matter).


  The practice is typically enough to avoid full-blown milk fever, or clinical symptoms of calcium deficiency, he said.


  But Cardoso added there has been little guidance on how much to acidify the diet to remobilise the optimal amount of calcium and avoid excretion in the urine.


  He also said no one has tested the effects of adding different concentrations of dietary calcium to the fully-acidified DCAD diet.


  ‚ÄúCalcium is important for many cellular processes," he explained, "Without adequate calcium concentrations, tissues don‚Äôt work optimally and are subject to inflammation and susceptible to disease.


  "We wanted to test whether an increased amount of calcium ‚Äì 2% of DM ‚Äì added to an acidified diet during the last month of pregnancy could prevent those issues and lead to more favorable reproductive outcomes,‚Äù Cardoso added.


  His team fed 76 Holstein cows one of three diets in the month before calving: a control, non-acidified DCAD diet with no added calcium; an acidified DCAD diet (-24 milliequivalents per 100 grams of dry matter) with no added calcium; and an acidified DCAD diet (-24 milliequivalents) with added calcium at 2% of dietary dry matter.


   


   


  The DCAD formulation was mixed with typical forages and corn silage in prepartum diets. After calving, all cows were switched to a typical postpartum diet with 1% of dietary dry-matter calcium.


  The researchers then monitored changes in the blood, uterus, ovaries, and pregnancy status at two and four weeks post-calving.


  ‚ÄúThere was a tendency for cows fed the negative DCAD + calcium diet to get pregnant at a higher rate than cows fed the control diet, but we need to test that in a larger population to be sure of that result,‚Äù Cardoso explained.


  He said that cows fed the diet with added calcium took less time to ovulate and had lower levels of uterine infection than cows on the other diets.


  This was likely due to the fact that cows on the calcium-added diet had more tight junction proteins in the uterine lining; these proteins bind adjacent cells, preventing a ‚Äúleaky‚Äù tissue that could allow pathogens to enter the bloodstream during calving.


  ‚ÄúOurs is the first study showing tight junction proteins even exist in the uterus of the dairy cow, and also clearly indicates that added calcium improves their number and function,‚Äù Cardoso said.


  Cows fed the calcium-added diet also had more favourable disease-fighting antioxidants in the blood and more glands in the uterine lining, which keep the organ clean and produce hormones that can kick-start ovulation. ‚ÄúThat could be why we saw better pregnancy rates,‚Äù he added.


  He points out that many producers have been using a negative DCAD strategy for decades, but aren‚Äôt acidifying the diet enough, taking it to only -5 milliequivalents and not adding calcium, or adding it at only 1% of dietary dry matter.


  ‚ÄúWe are saying that you need to go to -20 milliequivalents and up to 2% of dietary dry matter for calcium,‚Äù he said.

It is crystal clear that IMF is playing hard ball. One gets the feeling that the Fund is punishing Zambia for what happened in the past especially the perceived arrogant statements and actions of our leaders which included the rejection of an offer in 2015 and the expulsion of the IMF country representative, Dr. Alfredo Baldini, almost two years ago, who has not been replaced yet. There can be no IMF bailout without a Resident Representative. Zambia is well advised to prioritise the lobbying for the replacement of the Resident Representative.In the current circumstances, I would advise the Zambian government to do two things. First, Zambia should immediately embark on an informal behind the scenes economic diplomacy with the IMF by sending a team to Washington. The President of the Zambia should quietly appoint a team of about 5 or 6 imminent, independent, economic Zambian experts outside the government bureaucracy, who are respected in the corridors of power in the IMF, having worked there or dealt with them at the highest level and who have high level contacts there.

Of course, conventional doesn't always mean boring, and if you hurry, you can get a blazing fast 60W 2-port power brick compatible with both iPhones and Android handsets at a massive 35 percent discount equating to 19 bucks. This absolute beast is only one of a number of items available for 24 hours at a lower than ever price, as the same goes for a portable power bank duo comprised of the PowerCore Fusion 5000 and PowerCore 26800, for instance.


    As the name suggests, the PowerCore Fusion is more than a straightforward portable charger capable of getting Samsung's hot new Galaxy S20 Ultra from 0 to 100 percent battery capacity on the fly, as it can also hug a wall to juice up two mobile devices at once using the good old fashioned non-portable method.


    Meanwhile, the non-Fusion Anker PowerCore 26800 is just a charging monster you can carry around for weeks on end without worrying it'll ever get depleted. On sale at 28 bucks less than usual, that bad boy comes with a grand total of three USB output ports equipped with state-of-the-art PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technologies guaranteeing high charging speeds for three phones (or tablets) at the same time.


    Speaking of high-speed charging, we should mention the universally praised 36W 2-port USB-C Anker car charger is currently marked down by a decent 26 percent, and the 3-in-1 multi-device wireless charging station available at 40 percent off its list price is also no pushover, supporting up to 10 watts wirelessly and a 12W total output as far as its two USB-A ports are concerned.


    If you want to rely entirely on wireless charging, the affordable PowerWave Pad is even cheaper than usual after a 41 percent discount, supporting 10W speeds for compatible Android devices and capping off at 7.5 watts as far as modern iPhones are concerned. At the other end of the spectrum, you can get a power strip with three AC outlets and three charging ports totaling 18W USB output at a 30 percent discount.


    Last but not necessarily least, we all know you can never have too many charging cables, so you might as well purchase a Lightning or USB Type-C to USB-A 3-pack with varying sizes at 30 and 31 percent off list respectively. You can thank us later.

PRINCETON -- Fieldcrest started this game tentatively, cautiously. By the end, it was confidence and poise that carried it to the Class 2A sectional title on Friday at Prouty Gymnasium.


  Fieldcrest beat Sterling Newman 65-62 and won its first boys basketball sectional title since 2012, which also came on this floor.


  "A magical place for us," said Fieldcrest coach Matt Winkler, the only coach this school has known.


  Bryce Nordstrom had 17 points, Matt Lorton had 14, Cory Land had 12, Garrett Nix had 11 and Jaxson Cusac-McKay had 11 for Fieldcrest.


  "A team that will never be outworked," Winkler said. "Love each other. They play for each other. A joy."


  Fieldcrest is 27-6 on the season.


  The game didn't even end with a full buzzer, just a blurt from the scoreboard as Newman's last possession went out of bounds as time expired and the scorekeeper tried to stop the clock. Fieldcrest's fans streamed onto the court in celebration.


  Newman's season ends at 27-5. Devon House had 20 points and Marcus Williams had 19.


  Newman led 31-23 at halftime, but by then, Fieldcrest had ceased being choosy on offense.


  "Love the third quarter flow," Winkler said. "That was our pace."


  Fieldcrest led 47-44 to start the fourth.


  The fourth quarter was played freely, with both teams driving to the hoop or working for 3-point shots. Lorton buried a 3 from the top of the key, tying the score at 58 with 1:20 left.


  The biggest play belonged to Cusac-McKay. His driving layin at 58.1 seconds drew a foul. He added the free throw and it was 61-60.


  Lorton made two free throws and Fieldcrest led 63-60. House drove to the lane for a layin with 19.5 seconds left to pull within one, 63-62.


  Fieldcrest will play Tuesday in the Dekalb Supersectional against Elmhurst Timothy Christian, an 89-78 winner over Rockford Lutheran at Genoa-Kingston.


  In that game, Timothy Christian finished the game on a 7-0 run, and four players scored 14 or more points for the Trojans, led by Josh Harris' 25-point night and Matt Owens' 23-point game.

In a massive setback for the Congress, its prominent youth leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party and appeared set to join BJP Tuesday amid a rebellion in Madhya Pradesh by his supporters, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse. A shell-shocked Congress, in a largely symbolic move of no consequence, expelled Scindia, the party general secretary and scion of the erstwhile Gwalior royal family, on charges of anti- party activities.


  On Tuesday morning, as much of India was celebrating Holi, Scindia met senior BJP leader and Home Minister Amit Shah, following which he called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his 7, Lok Kalyan Marg residence. There was no official word on what transpired at the meetings. However, BJP sources asserted that the decision of the party's top two leaders to hold long deliberations with Scindia underlined the importance they attach to him. In the resignation letter dated March 9 to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Scindia said "it is now time for me to move on" as he was unable to serve the people of the country while remaining in the party.


  The Congress party said his letter was received at Sonia Gandhi's residence only at 12.20 pm on Tuesday. With Scindia quitting the party, the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh appeared headed for a collapse. Sources said 20 Congress MLAs from Scindia's camp have sent in their resignations -- 19 by email to Raj Bhavan and one, Bisahulal Singh in a hard copy letter.


  The Congress has a wafer-thin majority in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly whose current effective strength is 228. If the resignations of the 20 MLAs is accepted, the strength of the Assembly will fall to 208. The magic number for retaining the majority then will be 105. The Congress, however, will be left with 94 seats while the BJP has 104 seats. The Congress has the support of four Independents, two BSP and one SP MLA. Even with their support, Congress will fall sort of a majority, and it is anyway unclear if they will continue to support Congress or go with BJP Noting that the events of the day had been drawing themselves out for a year, Scindia, in his letter to Gandhi, said it was now best for him to look at a fresh start. "Having been a primary member of the Congress party for the last 18 years. It is now time for me to move on. I am tendering my resignation from the primary membership of the Congress and as you well know this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year," Scindia wrote in the letter. "While my aim and purpose remains the same as it has always been from the very beginning, to serve the people of my state and my country, I believe I am unable to do this anymore within this party," Scindia said in his resignation letter posted on Twitter. "To reflect and realise the aspirations of my people and workers I believe it is best that I now look ahead at a fresh start," he said.


  The former Guna MP also thanked Gandhi and his other former Congress colleagues for "providing him with a platform to have served the nation". Soon thereafter, a statement from AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said the Congress president has "approved the expulsion of Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Indian National Congress with immediate effect for anti-party activities." Meanwhile in Bhopal, 14 Congress MLAs loyal to Scindia sent their resignations to Madhya Pradesh Governor Lal Ji Tandon, Raj Bhavan sources said. Scindia, once considered a rising star of the party, has long been at loggerheads with Kamal Nath who belongs to the old guard. After narrowly winning the state Assembly elections in December 2018, Kamal Nath took over as chief minister.


  But trouble started brewing recently when Scindia's supporters in the government were side-lined, and it appeared that his ambitions to be the state Congress president were also thwarted. It was also clear that the central leadership was not ready to listen to his grievances. This weekend, Scindia and six ministers in the Kamal Nath Cabinet went to Bengaluru and became incommunicado. It then became clear that a rebellion was brewing in the party and Kamal Nath would lose the support of the six ministers as well as other MLAs loyal to Scindia. Kamal Nath on Tuesday wrote to Governor Tandon seeking immediate removal of six ministers who belonged to Scindia's camp. The outcome of the political drama being played out on Holi day goes beyond Madhya Pradesh, which itself is important for both the BJP and the Congress. MP was one of the three major states where the Congress evicted BJP in the series of Assembly elections before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. With the imminent loss of Madhya Pradesh, it will become clear that the Congress leadership has failed to keep a cohesive united front and has been unable to control the conflicting ambitions of its many regional leaders. Continued infighting is likely to further debilitate the party, which is already a pale shadow of its former greatness at the national level. Regaining Madhya Pradesh will greatly enhance BJP's strength in the Hindi belt, and Congress will have only Punjab and Rajasthan, where again it is beset with factional feuds, as the major states under its control. Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said joining hands with BJP at a time of "national crisis" speaks volumes about Scindia's "self-indulgent" ambitions. He added that people like Scindia prove they cannot thrive without power, and the sooner they leave the better.


  Another Congress leader, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, also slammed Scindia, saying it "is sad news for the Congress party". "He had been entrusted with important jobs by the party. But now the situation had come to such a pass that he found it more convenient to switch over to the other party," Chowdhury told PTI.


  "Some sort of allurement, enticement offered by the BJP had convinced him for switching over," Chowdhury said. "Now he has become the asset of the BJP party." PTI SKC MPB VJ VJ.
