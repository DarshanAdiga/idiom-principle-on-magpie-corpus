The number of refugees being resettled from Kenya had already slowed to a trickle even before COVID-19; now it has almost completely stopped. Returning voluntarily to Somalia, where insecurity is widespread and the health system is deeply stretched, seems even less of an alternative for most camp residents. As of August this year, UNHCR had reported no returns from Kenya to Somalia. The promise of local integration for refugees has also gradually dissipated as initiatives to extend state services to refugees remain stalled.

The relationship therapist has been helping her clients cope with mental health challenges brought on by the pandemic such as panic attacks and anxiety disorders
 Allen-Wilson has also observed that some of her clients are dealing with a huge amount of grief around losing loved ones to the coronavirus and the loss of their regular lifestyles.
 “I think that people are struggling with the loss of lives that they knew, the loss of rituals and quite frankly, the loss of human contact because the very thing that we were socialized to do, which is to socialize, was kind of stripped due to this COVID-19,” she said.
 “This was a huge undertaking for people to wrap their arms around living a different lifestyle and not knowing how long. I feel like that if anything people became more open to the process of therapy because they recognize that they had to do something — that we’re not in normal times. People need help. They need to process all that has changed in their life.”
 When the pandemic hit in March, Allen-Wilson quickly shifted from holding in- person therapy at her Wynnefield-based practice to offering online sessions for her clients.
 Allen-Wilson has more than 20 years of experience as a relationship therapist. She has worked as the director of Clinical Training at Drexel University’s Couple and Family Therapy Department, an assistant director of Training for the Post-Master’s Certificate Program, co-director of the Anger Management program and a full-time clinical practitioner at Council for Relationships.
 She earned her bachelor’s in psychology from Howard University and a doctor of philosophy degree in couple and family therapy and master of family therapy degree from Drexel University
 When Allen-Wilson started her practice in 2009, she named it F.A.I.T.H., which stands for Family and Individual Therapeutic Healing, because she regarded therapy as a healing tool.
 “A lot of African Americans and people of color are sometimes fearful of therapy and they tend to have a stigma that is attached to it – that if you were to go to a therapist or engage in therapeutic intervention, you’re crazy,” she said.
 She acknowledged that many African Americans have a cultural distrust of the mental health system.
 “When we have engaged in the clinical process sometimes it has not served us very well,” said Allen-Wilson, who is also a radio and television personality.
 “We have not been understood. We have often times been mistreated and devalued so it makes sense that people of color don’t trust this process.”
 “We have not had the best relationship as people of color with therapeutic intervension and what I realized early on was that I was committed to helping anybody that came through my doors, but particularly committed to people of color because I feel like we get the short end of the stick,” she said noting that African Americans have dealt with 400 years of slavery, systemic racism, social unrest and social inequities.
 “All of that has permeated our history on this soil and we need a safe environment to process all that pain,” Allen-Wilson said.
 She has built a thriving brand and is often called upon share her expertise for radio and television appearances.
 The Philadelphia native juggles running her clinical practice with working on Connections Matter, a business entity she that co-founded in 2015 with her husband, Morgan Wilson.
 They recently produced an online show titled “Quarantine Talks,” which offers people a safe space to talk about how they are feeling during the pandemic and strategies on how to interact with their families and partners.
 Allen-Wilson has authored a book titled Courageous Conversations Connect: A Pathway to Reset Your Mindset with Intentional Thoughts From the Inside Out and does media appearances and speaking engagements at colleges, universities and businesses under the umbrella of Connections Matter.
 “Part of the whole Connections Matters piece is engaging with corporate America,” Wilson said.
 He said they are helping businesses address issues of racism, bias and microagressions occurring in workplaces so that their staff and people of color can have a safer environment.
 “In the diversity and inclusion space we’re trying to bridge that gap and come into that void,” Wilson said.
 “We’ve been having webinars and workshops with companies and major corporations and helping them piece together what its like to have those conversations within their organizations (and) how does the executives in the C-suite create a safe environment to have those conversations.”
 Allen-Wilson views her work as a labor of love.
 “It leaves me with gratitude that even in the midst of a pandemic that our business is flourishing because we’re helping people on all different levels,” she added.

“You want somebody that’s going to lead these guys and make sure they’re doing what they’re supposed to do on and off the field and we felt that was Tony Coaxum,” said Price.
 Bringing back the football team was part of a vision Capehart and the rest of the administration have for Bluefield State with them seeing Coaxum as someone who can be a key player in helping that be achieved.
 “He brings the integrity, the heart and the passion it takes to embrace our vision of the future of Bluefield State and provide outstanding leadership in pursuing that vision,” Capehart said.
 For Coaxum, he is now tasked with building a roster of players and a coaching staff that fits the character he wants the Big Blues to have of being the best possible people in the classroom and community while playing like ‘maniacs’ on the gridiron.
 “I cannot wait to get our players in here and get this coaching staff and go out in the community and represent Bluefield State,” Coaxum said.
 The addition of all of the sports, especially football, will help change the atmosphere around the campus.
 “One of the things it will do is it’ll bring a new spirit to the campus both among the students, the alumni,” Capehart said.
 Football is one of 12 sports that are set to be added for the 2021-22 school year as the college looks to expand what it offers to prospective students.
 “We want more opportunity for students to come here, take advantage of our high quality education but also play the sport that they love,” Capehart said.
 Filling the rosters on those teams will bring around 250 new students to Bluefield State and to do that head coaches have to hired which they are in the middle of doing. Getting the football coach sorted out was the priority for the college.
 Bringing the 12 teams to Bluefield State are part of a plan that the college is undertaking led by Capehart including having on-campus housing for the first time in 52 years.
 “I feel safe to say that Bluefield State College is headed in the right direction. We have great leadership, we have great support, the city of Bluefield is right behind us,” Price said.

I'd never heard of the 1984 book "The War with Grandpa" by children's author Robert Kimmel Smith. I only knew that Robert De Niro played the grandfather in the film and that it was a comedy.      Yes, Robert De Niro does play the grandfather. It's not very funny. I have no plans to read the book.      A Google search showed that age recommendations for the book are 9-13. I'd lower those ages for the film, probably from 6-12, but no younger because the content is a little dicey when it gets around to kids pulling dangerous pranks.      Those 6- to 12-year-olds will probably lap up the shenanigans on display. But I just couldn't cotton to any of it (save a good De Niro performance). Some of the story is fun and, OK, some of the slapstick bits are funny. But there are far too many that aren't, and too many border on being cruel (not funny).      The protagonists are 12-year-old Peter (Oakes Fegley, terrific in "Wonderstruck"), and his grandpa Ed (Robert De Niro, darn good in "Taxi Driver"). Ed is a recent widower, now living alone is a house filled with memories. He's convinced by his daughter Sally (I didn't recognize it was Uma Thurman till halfway through) to move in with her, husband Arthur (Rob Riggle), Peter, and his younger and older sisters - cute Jenny (Poppy Gagnon) and boy-crazy Mia (Laura Marano).      The seeds of the tale of conflict are found in the parents' decision to put Ed in Peter's bedroom, and consign Peter to the unfinished attic. Peter is not thrilled. In fact, since he's 10, and maturity hasn't quite set in, he's angry - selfish without realizing it.      His friends at school, upon finding out about the dilemma, persuade him to go to war with grandpa, with the goal of getting his room back. Peter slips a scrawled Declaration of War under grandpa's door (the spoils of it being his room). At the same time, Ed's local longtime pals Jerry (Christopher Walken) and Danny (Cheech Marin) are shown the Declaration, and convince him that he must "respond to this sort of aggression."      That's the whole movie. Peter is a nice kid, Grandpa is a nice guy. Peter becomes incensed at the unfairness of the situation and stops being nice. Grandpa tries to calm him down. Peter won't be calmed.      Bring on the pranks, initially small-time innocent stuff like an alarm going off at 3 a.m., which escalates to booby traps that toss grandpa up in the air and down on the floor. The antics go back and forth, and are joined by pratfalls, forced overacting (except for De Niro, who manages to keep some dignity in his role), mood swings that turn on a dime from resentment to adoration on the part of Fegley, and the pointless presence of the annoying older sister who, I've since been informed, isn't even in the book.      There's also the question of what the heck Jane Seymour is doing in the film, as a new friend of Ed. It's a thankless part that gets her involved in a "winner takes all" seniors versus kids trampoline dodgeball game, with Pete's bedroom as the prize. I somehow made it through the tortuous, slo-mo, knockabout sequence and then, for you, dear reader, backed it up and watched it again, this time with a stopwatch. It lasts six long minutes, plenty of time for a bathroom break.      Things get serious. Ed orates a message to Peter: "War is no game. Only kids and fools and generals think that. War hurts and wounds and kills and causes misery. We've gotta end this somehow."      They do, but not before the film dips into a predictable and vanilla birthday party sequence for little Jenny, and then conveniently but unconvincingly ties up all of the story's problems in a big bow.      "The War with Grandpa" opens in theaters on Oct. 9.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "The War with Grandpa"   Written by Tom J.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a new form of waste that is not easy to handle. Take masks, which are made up of three elements – the “fabric” part, the metal strip for pinching on the nose, and the elastic bands. Here lies the first complication, as the different materials cannot be recycled together. What is more, the protective part is not actually made of fabric, but of a plastic called polypropylene. As for the gloves, at best they are made of natural latex; at worst they are also plastic and give rise to the same problems as masks as they decompose.
 ## Visible pollution
 Environmental groups have been sounding the alarm for several months now. In February OceansAsia published the first shocking pictures of beaches strewn with pandemic-related debris near Hong Kong.
 In Europe, teams from Opération mer propre (Operation Clean Sea), founded by diver Laurent Lombard, were the first to find signs of this pollution on the French Mediterranean coast. The association continues to publicize the growing ecological impact of the coronavirus crisis.
 Last month, volunteers who turned out to clear rubbish from Lake Geneva for World Cleanup Day collected piles of protective masks. Non-governmental organizations such as Earth.org and Greenpeace are also trying to draw the authorities’ attention to the problems posed by PPE.

By REBECCA SANTANA and STACEY PLAISANCE   Associated Press  
 LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) — Ripping tarps from already damaged roofs and scattering debris piled by roadsides, Delta inflicted a new round of destruction on Louisiana as it struck communities still reeling after Hurricane Laura took a similar path just six weeks earlier.
 Delta hit as a Category 2 hurricane, with top winds of 100 mph (155 kph) but rapidly grew weaker. By early Saturday, it dwindled to a tropical storm with 60 mph (95 kph) winds. Still, forecasters warned of danger from storm surge and flash floods across much of southwestern Louisiana and parts of neighboring Texas.
 Delta made landfall Friday evening near the coastal town of Creole — a distance of only about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from where Laura struck land in August, killing 27 people in Louisiana. The earlier storm damaged nearly every home and building in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Piles of moldy mattresses, sawed-up trees and other debris still lined the streets.
 Mayor Nic Hunter said tarps were flying off homes across the city.
 “I’m in a building right now with a tarp on it and just the sound of the tarp flapping on the building sounds like someone pounding with a sledgehammer on top of the building,“ Hunter said as he rode out the storm downtown. ”It’s pretty intense.”
 In Lake Charles, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from where Delta came ashore, water leaked through the ceiling of Ernest Jack's bedroom as he tried to sleep Friday night. Jack said the tarp cover the roof damage caused by Laura hadn’t blown off. His windows were covered to protect against flying debris.
 “It’s raining real hard; it’s flooding; the wind is strong,” Jack said Friday night. “I’m OK. I’m not worried about nothing, just praying that everything goes well.”
 In the town of Lake Arthur, Delta's winds peeled shingles off the roof of L’Banca Albergo Hotel, an eight-room boutique hotel in what used to be a bank.
 “I probably don’t have a shingle left on the top of this hotel,” owner Roberta Palermo said as the winds gusted outside.
 Palermo said the electricity was out and she could see pieces of metal coming off the roof of a 100-year-old building across the street. Unsecured trash cans were flying around the streets.
 “There is a lot of power lines down all over the place, there’s ... really deep water in certain spots,” said hotel guest Johnny Weaver. He had been out in the weather with his friends earlier and the friend’s car was stranded in the water.
 Delta's reach stretched as far west as Galveston, Texas, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from where the storm struck Louisiana. Two homes under construction were toppled by winds, as were some trees and signs in the area. Beach dunes flattened by earlier storms allowed storm surge to reach beneath some of Galveston's raised beach houses.
 Power outages in Louisiana and neighboring Texas neared 600,000 homes and businesses early Saturday, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us. Almost 40,000 outages were reported in Mississippi.
 Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, made the record books when it struck the Gulf Coast. It was the first Greek- alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental U.S. And it became the 10th named storm to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a century-old record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.
 The storm’ was projected to move into northern Mississippi on Saturday and then into the Tennessee Valley as a tropical depression.
 Delta was the fourth named storm to strike Louisiana in 2020. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip just three days before Laura struck. And Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.
 Some who rode out Laura chose to hunker down again with Delta. In Lafayette, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Lake Charles, Jeanne-Marie Gove could hear debris hitting the front door of her apartment Friday night and her patio gate banging open and shut.
 “The wind is much worse than what Hurricane Laura brought,” Gove said in a message on Twitter.
 The roof from a trailer at the mobile home park behind her apartment was torn off and being tossed down the sidewalk.
 “The wind gusts are making the glass from our windows bow inward,” Gove added. “It’s pretty scary.”

“He was just the perfect fit for us,” said Bluefield State College President Robin Capehart.
 Even though there have not been players putting on Bluefield State jerseys since 1980, there is a lot of history on the gridiron for the historically black college.
 The college, then known as the Bluefield Colored Institute, won the Black national championships in 1927 and 1928 going undefeated for 21 consecutive games.
 “Today Bluefield State College makes history, again. Today Bluefield State College has come back to its roots. Today is a renaissance to excellence on and off the field of play,” said Reverend Garry Moore, Chairman of the Bluefield State College Board of Governors, during the press conference.
 Games are planned to begin next fall for the Big Blues as Coaxum has a lot of work to do before then with his focus on making sure to integrate himself in the community and build a team as good off the field as on.
 “We’re going to make Bluefield, West Virginia, proud of the team we’re going to put together,” Coaxum said.
 The Charleston, South Carolina, native comes to Bluefield from the University of Northern Colorado where he was in his first year as the special teams coordinator and defensive backs coach.
 The West Point graduate won a Super Bowl ring in 2016 as an assistant coach for the Denver Broncos. He spent seven years as an assistant coach at Army prior that with a year being an assistant with the Baltimore Ravens sandwiched in between those two places.
 What stood out about Coaxum during the hiring process for the search committee was not only his vast experience coaching at all three levels of the game but his qualities off the field.
 Coax sees his biggest strength as a football coach being a leader and with his background Capehart and Derrick Price, interim Athletic Director and head men’s basketball coach, feel he can implement the discipline needed to get the program restarted on the right foot.

She represented Bihar as one of the speakers at SEE Talks held at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai and was among the nine panellists selected by the National Institute of Rural Development, government of India, at the consultation workshop for mainstreaming gram panchayat development plan. She is Ritu Jaiswal, a woman mukhiya, who is now a candidate from Parihar assembly constituency on the ticket of RJD, a party often blamed for accommodating wives of musclemen as proxies and paratrooper candidates. Ritu has earned fame by her work in the panchayat, a rarity for a state that has often seen woman enter politics as proxies for their husbands, which is mere tokenism to the cause of giving representation to capable women in politics.Her husband, Arun Kumar, an IAS officer who took voluntary retirement when he was posted as commissioner in the chief vigilance commission few years ago in 2018, is assisting her and is happy with her commitment.Though fighting election was never on her mind, her visit to her in-laws village Narkatiya, under Raj Singhwahini panchayat in 2013 was the trigger for Ritu to take to public life. She soon left her job in a Delhi-based public school and decided to work at the grassroots level despite the initial discouragement from villagers, who felt she would not be able to survive in the rough and tumble of politics. But she continued. "Later, the people, especially the women, wanted me to contest mukhiya election and I won it. Today, my panchayat is connected with a road, has solar water pumps and tanks, it is fully open defecation free (ODF) and all households and even the streets are well illuminated with lights. During Covid-19, the entire panchayat united to help me extend help to the needy," she said, adding she would like the same spirit to continue. "When I look back, I feel I took the right decision. Politics needs a new meaning and it can happen if more spirited women and men join it. I was preparing as an independent candidate and I am happy RJD has selected me. My focus is on changing Parihar, whichever way I get an opportunity," she said.

It's taken Mahindra a decade to bring out a new generation of the Thar and in that time, the company has been able to get its strategy in place. There of course are a lot of expectations from the SUV in India and our review told you how, it has lived up to it. But there are a lot of boxes to tick and providing accessories right from the word go. But this time around there's a clear demarcation on what is on offer.

Using Morgan-Jones' books, Peter Welfare, a HammondCare chef, created a chicken drumstick satay and a pureed fruit salad for a 51-year-old mother of two with early onset dementia. She was living on ice cream, custard and fruit, and was facing a possible feeding tube because of her difficulty eating. The pureed chicken was molded into the shape of drumsticks; similarly, the pureed fruit was set on yogurt and sculpted to look like the fruits themselves. "It was a smashing success. She ate it all," reports Welfare.

MINERSVILLE — Backyard braggin’ rights — and the trophy that goes with them — belong to Nativity.
 The Green Wave trounced Minersville 42-7 on Friday night at the Battlin’ Miners Veterans Memorial Stadium in the third “Battle in the Backyard” to take home the trophy for the first time.
 Nativity did it with a dominating defensive effort and the legs and arm of junior quarterback Cody Miller.
 The Green Wave scored five times and racked up 322 yards in the first half while holding Minersville scoreless with 91 total yards to take a 35-0 halftime lead and invoke the mercy rule for the entire second half.
 “I think our defense is getting progressively better and better and better week by week,” said Nativity head coach Pat Mason. “Every week it’s somebody different.”
 Offensively, Miller scored two touchdowns on runs of 64 and 5 yards. He also passed for three scores: a 60-yarder to Dylan Schreffler to open the scoring; and TD passes of 51 and 24 yards to Stephan Spolski, who had three catches for 86 yards.
 After taking that 35-0 lead at the half, Nativity senior running back Jacob Hoffman (10 carries, 72 yards) put the icing on the cake when he took a handoff on the first play from scrimmage of the second half and ran it in for a 46-yard score to make it 42-0.
 Hoffman’s TD run was set up by a 34-yard kickoff return by Marcus Vaupel.
 Nativity substituted freely from that point on, but Minersville’s only score came on a 46-yard interception return of an Augustus Warke pass by junior defensive back Jared Graeff, who also led the Miners in rushing with 36 yards on 10 carries.
 “I’ll never be disappointed in the effort from my kids,” said Minersville head coach Justin Frantz after the game. “They fly around the field and we said from day one we’re going to be playing freshmen and sophomores, and we’ll live with their mistakes but we have their effort and I’m proud of them.”
 The Green Wave mobbed Mason and the trophy after their big win, but the game meant more than the trophy to Mason.
 After noting that to his knowledge this was the first time Nativity had beaten Minersville in roughly 30 years, Mason took time to take stock of his team’s season.
 “The trophy’s great, but we’re sitting at 4-1 right now and we got things rollin’ pretty good. To me, this was a win for the program and the school and the players who do what I ask them to every single day. It’s something we’re looking to build off of.”
