Currently at 6-2 overall, the Bills are in the driver's seat in terms of their playoff future and chance of winning the AFC East title. Buffalo hasn't won the division since 1995, but the reason the Bills might have to start playing their best football now is that their remaining eight games are among the NFL's toughest schedules left, according to Tankathon.

The surprise activation of rookie defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos from the injured reserve list yesterday should help. He was getting pressure at an astounding rate before his high ankle sprain. While he was out, Brian Burns become a world-wrecking pass-rush force who now has to be in the best- defensive-end-in-the-NFL conversation. Assuming Gross-Matos is in the lineup and these two can get consistent pressure on Mahomes, it will help limit Kansas City's potent offense a great deal. They have to be smart about it, though. Mahomes is most-dangerous when he's outside of the pocket improvising. Burns and especially Gross-Matos have to maintain their edge discipline and not allow No. 15 to slip out and do his Houdini on the run routine.

On election night, everything went off without a hitch from their perspective. Trump's “red wave” crashed into most battleground states but was then pushed back by the “blue wave” supposedly resulting from the millions of mail-in ballots that the mainstream media wants everyone to believe were almost entirely for Biden. Not only is so statistically unlikely as to practically be impossible, but it also followed a suspicious suspension of the ballot count for at least several hours in the election-deciding states that had yet to declare a winner. As expected, Trump condemned this blatant fraud, thus conforming to the role of a corrupt lawbreaker and wannabe dictator who will stop at nothing to cling to power like many were preconditioned to wrongly believe. Even if Trump somehow pulls off a legal victory and ends up winning the race, his legitimacy is now in dispute.

Hendrickson said that nonprofit experience will come in handy as the county continues efforts it has begun in recent years to address homelessness in Gwinnett.
 “The nonprofit experience has given me into what some of the challenges are of our indigent community, like what does poverty look like to people who are experiencing poverty, what are the challenges with some systemic issues that have created poverty, homelessness, food insecurity and really just looking at it from a policy lens,” she said.
 Hendrickson said she plans to use her background in social work and social welfare policy to find ways to “leverage local, state, federal opportunities” to tackle issues related to poverty in Gwinnett County.
 “So I think nonprofit gives me that lens to better address those challenges because they’re here and COVID has exacerbated some of that and we’re going to need to address it,” she said. “We can’t ignore it because it’s going to create a deeper divide and that’s just not what we need.”
 And, Nash said the county government and nonprofit parts of Hendrickson’s background should help her as she transitions into the role.
 “Ms. Hendrickson’s experience with Gwinnett County, and with the Gwinnett Coalition, have given her a head start with building relationships across Gwinnett and beyond,” the current chairwoman said. “Those relationships will be valuable as she advocates for Gwinnett.
 “Her time with Gwinnett as an employee also means that she likely begins with a level of trust from employees across the county organization, which will be helpful as she steps into her leadership of the organization.”
 One of the first things Hendrickson will have to look at is the county’s budget. It will be an unusual situation because of the way Gwinnett’s financial year works. The financial year is synced with the calendar year, so the budget is being prepared now by Nash, but it won’t be voted on until Hendrickson’s first meeting as chairwoman.
 The proposed budget will be unveiled by Nash later this month. Traditionally, time is scheduled with members of the board to review it with staff, ask questions and make suggestions after it is unveiled.
 “So, we’re coming in adopting a budget that had been vetted by the previous board, but it is what it is,” Hendrickson said.
 Nash pledged with work with Hendrickson and fellow new commission members Kirkland Carden and Jasper Watkins III over the remainder of the year to get them up to speed on the budget and other aspects of county government before they take office. The new commissioners, all Democrats, will also have two fellow Democrats, Ben Ku and Marlene Fosque, who are already on the board, and who helped create the goals the budget was based on.
 But there will also be some one-on-one time between Gwinnett’s current chairwoman and its incoming chairwoman to work on the transfer of power..
 “I expect to spend time with chair-elect Hendrickson focusing specifically on responsibilities that are unique to the chair position as well as more general topics like finances and infrastructure,” Nash said. “Many of these activities include representing Gwinnett externally at the regional level.”
 After all, next year, Hendrickson will be the one building and presenting the county’s proposed budget.

Hendrickson will be the first Black person to serve as county commission chairman, who is the elected head of county government. It is the first elected office she will have ever held.
 She said she feels she’s inheriting a county that is well-positioned for future growth — which is is something she sees as one of Gwinnett’s top issues to deal with.
 But, who is Nicole Love Hendrickson?
 While the 40-year-old mother has no elected experience, she is not coming into the job totally green when it comes to county government. She was the county’s community outreach director for about five years before leaving that job to run for commission chair.
 “I know the leadership structure,” Hendrickson said. “I know all of the department heads because I’ve worked with them. I understand how decisions on policy are made. I’ve attended Board of Commissioners meetings, so I know how they work, so yes, I have a strong basis of where I’m starting from.
 “It’s not I’m starting from scratch, just out of thin air.”
 One of the more well known programs created during during her tenure with the county was the Gwinnett 101 program where residents can learn about how county government works. She also oversaw the county’s youth commission and cultural outreach programs.
 A lot of that work has entailed bringing people from different backgrounds together, she said.
 “I think that gives me a unique experience and perspective on how we move forward to address some of our challenges because it’s going to take a lot of bipartisanship to start advancing some of the things we want to do, it’s going to take a collective effort,” Hendrickson said.
 “I realize there are Republicans that did not vote for me, there’s constituents who did not vote for me, but I realize that in order to address the real challenges, it’s going to take a collective effort. I have experience bringing people to the table, and building consensus and building community and building a platform where voices can be heard and people can have a seat at the table, and we can work toward a unified vision.”
 She was also familiar with the Gwinnett County community before she joined the county government. She previously worked with the Gwinnett Coalition for Health and Human Services as an associate director for seven years before joining the county government.

As far as the Chiefs defense goes, there's not a whole lot of help to be found. The champs have a strong secondary led by Tyrann Mathieu and lethal pass rushers both inside (Chris Jones) and out (Frank Clark). If there is a weakness, it's their linebacker corps, which can be exploited in coverage. McCaffrey and Davis are both excellent receivers, so it's worth seeing if they can win one-on-one against Damien Wilson and Anthony Hitchens. This would also be a good time to get the tight ends more involved. Ian Thomas and Chris Manhertz may be disappointing as receivers but targeting them would be a tendency breaker. Brady needs to pull out all the stops and use as many of those as he can get.

The intention behind that claim was to precondition the public into expecting that Trump would resort to an illegal power grab if he lost the election fair and square, the latter scenario of which people were made to believe since the Democrats spent four years insincerely portraying themselves as the guardians of America's electoral integrity via their now-debunked Russiagate and Ukrainegate crusades. All of this was meant to preemptively deflect any suspicions that they were preparing to carry out what's arguably the largest electoral fraud in American history, though the means through which they planned to do so unexpectedly changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which presented an entirely new opportunity for them. That was the prospect of a massive influx of mail-in ballots into an electoral system that obviously wasn't prepared for it.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden used his first national address as president-elect to vow to heal a deeply divided nation, declaring it was time to “let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end” and reaching out to the millions of people who voted against him to say, “Let’s give each other a chance.”His calls for reconciliation at a Saturday evening victory celebration came even as President Donald Trump continued to argue that the election had been stolen from him, an indication that the divisive politics that have gripped the U.S. over the past four years are far from over.It also suggested that even as Biden seeks to build out a government during his transition to the presidency, the president has little interest in helping him do so.“For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment,” Biden said during a drive-in event in Wilmington, Delaware. “It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again.”Biden heads into his first full day as president-elect on Sunday with key staffing decisions to make as the coronavirus rages. The always-frenzied 10-week transition period before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 already has been shortened by the extra time it took to determine the winner of Tuesday’s election.The second Catholic to be elected president, Biden planned to attend church at St. Joseph on the Brandywine near his home in Wilmington, as he does nearly every week. He began Election Day with a visit to the church and the grave of his son, Beau, a former Delaware attorney general who died of brain cancer in 2015.His top priority in the transition is expected to be quickly naming a chief of staff. Biden suggested during the campaign that his first call after being elected would be to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, but his advisers have not said whether the two have spoken yet.Biden said Saturday that he would announce a task force of scientists and experts Monday to develop a “blueprint” to begin beating back the virus by the time he assumes the presidency. He said his plan would be “built on bedrock science” and “constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern.” A former surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, and a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, David Kessler, will lead the task force.This coming week, Biden will launch his agency review teams — the group of transition staffers that have access to key agencies in the current administration to smooth the transfer of power. The teams will collect and review information such as budgetary and staffing decisions, pending regulations and other work in progress from current staff at the departments to help Biden’s team prepare to transition.Biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million, a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted. He made Trump the first incumbent president to be denied a second term since Republican George H.W. Bush lost to Bill Clinton in 1992.His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, used her first address as vice president-elect to showcase her history-making place as the first Black woman to become vice president, an achievement that comes as the U.S. faces a reckoning on racial justice. The California senator is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency and the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government.“While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,” Harris said in her speech Saturday night.To win, Biden successfully unified different wings of the Democratic Party around their universal loathing of Trump, garnering support from progressive insurgents and establishment moderates alike.“The party came together to defeat Donald Trump,” said Brian Lemek, a longtime progressive fundraiser and executive director of Brady PAC, which invested $6 million on 2020 candidates supporting gun violence prevention efforts and voting rights. “His main job right now, we all think, is to heal the nation.”Biden senior adviser Ted Kaufman said the transition team will focus on the “nuts and bolts” of building the new administration in coming days. He said Biden plans to speak to legislative leaders and governors from both parties.Biden may not make top Cabinet choices for weeks. But he built his presidential run around bipartisanship and he has spent the days since Tuesday’s election pledging to be a president for all Americans. That suggests he could be willing to appoint some Republicans to high-profile administration positions.Many former Republican officeholders broke with Trump to endorse Biden’s campaign. His selection of some of them to join the new government could appease Senate Republicans, who may have to confirm many of Biden’s choices for top jobs. The GOP could retain control of the chamber after two special elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.Still, too much across-the-aisle cooperation could draw the ire of progressives. Some already worry that uncooperative Senate Republicans could force Biden to scale back his ambitious campaign promises to expand access to health care and lead a post-pandemic economic recovery that relies on federal investment in green technology and jobs to help combat climate change.“I think there will be a huge misuse of the word ‘unity’ to imply that we need to water down the ideas that Joe Biden just campaigned on,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. He said the country was more united around bold solutions to big problems than small-scale efforts.Biden’s efforts at bipartisan reconciliation, meanwhile, could still be derailed by Trump’s refusing to concede the presidential race. It wasn’t clear if Biden and Trump would meet in coming days, as is the modern tradition. Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told CNN late Saturday that there’s been no contact between Trump’s team and Biden’s.Symone Sanders, a Biden campaign spokeswoman, said “Donald Trump does not get to decide the winner of elections.”“The people decide, voters in the country decide,” Sanders said. “And voters have made their choice very clear.”Trump started his Sunday morning by retweeting support from a prominent legal expert calling for review of the balloting.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said Trump had a right to pursue recounts and legal challenges. But he noted that those efforts will unlikely change the outcome and he urged the president to dial back his rhetoric.“I think one has to be careful in the choice of words. I think when you say the election was corrupt or stolen or rigged that that’s unfortunately rhetoric that gets picked up by authoritarians around the world. And I think it also discourages confidence in our democratic process here at home,” Romney told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”___Associated Press writers Alexandra Jaffe in Wilmington, Delaware, Steve Peoples in New York and Aamer Madhani in Chicago contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
