A popular Iowa college town offers visitors a peaceful, quiet visit with interesting things to do and great pizza.      Grinnell is home to Grinnell College, which adds to the comfortable and inviting feel of this city of just over 9,000 residents. It is a place where visitors can walk the streets, shop, eat and enjoy the friendly, laid-back atmosphere.      Grinnell is known as the Jewel of the Prairie, as it is loaded with some of Iowa's best independent restaurants and unique shops. It has been named as one of the Top Ten Coolest Small Towns in America by travel journalists.      History   A visit must include spending some time admiring the Merchants' National Bank building, one of the eight Midwestern "jewel box" banks designed by Louis Sullivan, an architecture legend and mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright.      The jewel box banks are made of brick. For the Grinnell bank, Sullivan chose a variety of brick colors, giving the 1914 building a reddish-brown appearance. The building has a jewel box or strongbox look with an ornamental interior and cathedral-like exterior.      The building is open to the public. It is currently the Grinnell Area Chamber of Commerce and visitors center. It is open year-round Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call ahead for a weekend visit. Docents are often available to answer questions. For more information call 641-236-6555.      Art   Grinnell thrives in arts and culture. The Grinnell College Museum of Art, formerly known as the Faulconer Gallery, is in the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts and is worth a stop. The museum offers major exhibits from international and national artists. The museum encompasses a print and drawing study room that offers students and faculty a place to see original works on paper from the museum's collection, including some by Pablo Picasso and Rembrandt van Rijn. The museum has more than 6,000 items.      It is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday except for major holidays, but is currently closed due to the pandemic. Check the website for opening information or contact wrightl@grinnell.edu. The museum is also offering virtual tours and information from the artists at grinnell.edu/campus-life/arts-culture/museum.      Unique stay   There were probably times, as a student, you might have fallen asleep in class, but this unique, fun hotel offers visitors a chance to sleep in a classroom and not get in trouble.      Hotel Grinnell is a 1921 former junior high building with a variety of modern hotel rooms. Although the rooms are modern, they are also retro, and the design incorporates school items such as benches and the original hardwood floors. Rooms, in general, are half classroom and proved to be quiet and peaceful.      The hotel uses a bit of humor. An example is the necktie visitors hang on the door to not be disturbed. Rooms are not all the same as the former locker rooms are now bunk rooms. Each room also has a chalkboard. One of guests' favorite amenities are the complimentary bikes to get around town.      Different artwork is displayed in each room. The halls have been kept looking like a school, yet with a comfortable setting of a modern hotel.      The Periodic Table bar takes on a gymnasium look with an operating scoreboard on the wall. Owner-Operator Angela Harrington said the bar specializes in craft cocktails and mocktails. They have suspended food service at this time to encourage guests to dine around town.      The hotel is currently open with touchless check-in and has suspended daily cleaning services to minimize the exposure to others of each room. However, there are always housekeeping services available when needed. Visit hotelgrinnell.com for more information.      Pizza   There are a variety of great restaurants in Grinnell, and one that pizza seekers stand in line for is Pagliai's, known for their fresh made dough. They have been serving up pies since 1957. They also offer made from scratch dishes passed down from generation to generation. It won't disappoint and is within walking distance of Hotel Grinnell. Visit pagliaisgrinnellia.com for hours and new on when dine-in reopens.      Grinnell is a gem of a town located between Des Moines and Iowa City. It is well worth the short venture off I-80 to enjoy a day, a weekend, or to kick back for a few days and enjoy a peaceful walkable community adventure.      If you travel soon, make sure to check online or with the places you plan to visit to see if they are open, or have new hours, etc.

Peaceful Nelson, Nevada, offers visitors a step back in time to the vibrant mining days of Nevada, the Silver State, an escape from daily life.   This ghost town is off the beaten path, and while standing among its historic buildings one would not think they were just a 45-minute drive from the bright lights of Las Vegas. Those traveling from Vegas on Route 95 will also pass Eldorado Canyon and "the monument," Nevada Historical Marker 9.      After an enjoyable ride through the valley travelers will come upon several original buildings from the 1700s. Originally, Nelson was called Eldorado, named by the Spaniards. They were the first to find gold in the mountains. About 100 years later the miners and prospectors developed the Techatticup Mine, which stands today in Nelson. The mine has a clouded reputation of killings that resulted from labor and management disputes. However, in 1861 the mine was considered to be the most important in the canyon as it produced millions of dollars of gold ore. The mine, a short distance from the Colorado River, was served by steamboats. The name Techatticup came from two Paiute words meaning "hungry" and "bread."      This now ghost of a town produced millions of dollars of copper, silver and gold until the mine closed in 1945.      Today mine tours are offered by stopping at the General Store in Nelson to sign up for the Eldorado Canyon Mine Tours. The buildings offer a historic tour of collectables from the area. Canoe and kayak rentals are available for those wanting to take an adventure on the beautiful Colorado River.      Inside the General Store is a small museum with pictures and information on the filming that takes place at Nelson, along with memorabilia and historic information. All ages will enjoy exploring the museum and walking around outside finding old cars, trucks and airplanes. The planes were used as props for the movie "3,000 Miles to Graceland." This ghost town is a popular area for use in movie backdrops, photo shoots and music videos. The National Geographic Channel's "Brain Games" was filmed in Nelson, as were the movies "Eye of the Beholder" and "Breakdown."      Do not get your hopes up when you travel downhill and see the Texaco sign standing tall among the historic buildings of Nelson. It is also historic. There is not a gas station or place to eat here. However, the General Store offers snacks and drinks. Fill your tank before setting out to visit Nelson.      Once you have completed the exploration of Nelson, continue to the end of the road where a spectacular view of the Colorado River awaits. Pack a picnic and find a rock, bring chairs, or sit in the car and enjoy what nature has to offer. Visitors can walk down to the river from this area.      Coming back uphill from the river, continue past the general store and on the left will be a few houses and a dirt road, Main Street. Turn left and follow it for a desert drive. If it is raining or has recently rained, better go back the way you came. If you are short on gas or time, do not do it! However, if you do continue, it is a climb to the top where big eared jackrabbits might be seen. Keep your camera ready as road runners are fast but you might get a picture, and the burros are much slower -- they will pose longer.      The road will take desert adventurers back down to Highway 95. A left turn goes into Searchlight, another mining town which, in its heyday around 1902 was more populated than Las Vegas. Today about 500 residents call this town home.      A few buildings are left from the mining days. Searchlight has modern structures, too -- gas stations, places to get a drink and some food, including McDonalds. Las Vegas is one hour from Searchlight and 30 minutes from Laughlin.

TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly higher Friday after meandering on news about economies reopening, mixed with worries about the prolonged health risks from the new coronavirus. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 recouped earlier losses to finish at 20,037.47, up 0.6%. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.2% to 1,927.88. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 1.4% to 5,404.80. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was little changed, falling less than 0.1% to 23,811.51, while the Shanghai Composite inched up 0.2% to 2,875.59. “Bright spots in the markets and the economy should not breed complacency about being out of the woods,\" Riki Ogawa of Mizuho Bank said. “Fact is, even as economies prepare to emerge from varying degrees of lockdown, restoration of ‘normalcy’ is a much longer road.” Parts of Japan are gradually easing requests for people to stay home and for some businesses to stay closed, while worries deepen over case numbers rising. The Keidanren, which represents more than 1,000 Japanese companies and regional economic groups, released guidelines for safer work, including instructions on having office workers coming into the office just three days each week to minimize commutes, and adapting workplaces for social distancing. Overnight, Wall Street rallied back from a sharp morning drop. The S&P 500 climbed 1.2% to 2,852.20 in another scattershot day of trading, with many stocks flipping from the bottom of the leaderboard to the top following a few sharp reversals in momentum. Wall Street has been wavering for weeks as it digests gargantuan moves the market made earlier this year, first down more than 30% on worries over the coming recession and then up more than 30% on hopes for a relatively quick rebound.

In the southern state of Karnataka -- whose capital Bengaluru is India's hub of information technology -- the government pushed out P. Manivannan, principal secretary of the Labor Department earlier this week. At his behest, the department put on notice companies that had not paid salaries for April in the wake of the lockdown. In response, the Karnataka Employers' Association shot off a letter to the chief minister of the state, stating that the notice was akin to a threat from the government.
 Karnataka's chief minister is slated to amend acts governing factories, industrial disputes and labor laws this week. The state has already amended an act to allow companies to buy land from farmers. Until now, companies could only buy agricultural land through a government agency.
 On the other hand, states such as Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Goa and Bihar exempted factories and industrial units from the earlier cap of eight hours of day and 48 hours weekly. According to the changes, the units can force employees to work 12 hours a day, with payment for overtime and a mandatory break of at least 30 minutes after every six working hours. In any case, the working hours should not surpass 72 hours a week, according to an Odisha government notification.
 Arun Kumar, economist and professor at the New Delhi-based Institute of Social Sciences, noted that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party wanted to revert labor laws to 2014 right after inserting Modi as prime minister. He said the BJP had started modifying laws, such as allowing fixed-term employment in all the sectors, but had to slow down owing to criticism it was favoring industrialists and ignoring the working class.

At present, the regular January 2021 $80 calls are selling for approximately $6 per contract. That is an extra 8.5% yield (over 9 months) based off the current share price. Yes, there is risk that shares would be called away, but what one is doing here is merely locking in a guaranteed profit in an environment of elevated uncertainty. The risk in a covered call is losing one's shares. Downside risk is in no way enhanced when selling call options against long stock. In fact, the extra premium received reduces the overall cost basis of the shares. Reducing risk is a good practice, especially in the present environment.
 Therefore, to sum up, the decision by Jacobs Engineering to keep on paying the dividend, keep staff on board as well as to not pay down debt leads us to believe that a suitable course of action at present in this stock is to hedge. One can do this by using the high implied volatility evident in this stock to sell call options against long positions. Let's see what the third quarter brings.

Someone is stealing plants from Apalachicola's community garden.
   
 Not just the vegetables, or the leaves, or the stalks, but the whole thing, and they want to get to the bottom of.
   
 "We have had at least five boxes vandalized, some multiple times," said Sabrina Fornes, a spokeswoman for the garden. "Whole plants including bell pepper, okra, cucumber and others have been taken. It doesn't make sense. It's not just the vegetable, it's the whole plant.
   
 "We've had one garden box that has had 14 whole plants taken at different times, and another garden box that had eight plants taken at separate times," she said.
   
 The decade-old garden, on City Square, at 8th Street and Avenue F, across from Chestnut Cemetery, now features the work of about 40 gardeners, who tend 28 boxes, plus an orchard, pollinator garden and in-ground plot.
   
 "Many of our boxes are gardened by two people," said Fornes. "Currently, we are growing tomatoes, squash, beans, cucumbers, peppers, eggplant, corn, okra, pumpkin and herbs in our garden boxes."
   
 Fornes said one gardener had only one plant pulled up in nine year, "but this year she's had multiple plants taken. She regretted she didn't get her peppers the day before they took the whole plant.
   
 "People start this from seeds," she said. "These are the little babies. They watch them get up to maturity and someone just yanks them out."
   
 Fornes said it is possible that hunger is the motive, but she's skeptical.
   
 "If they were hungry they would take just the vegetables," she said. "They're pulling up the whole plant and they take it with them, and a lot of time it's even before the vegetable is ready. We really think this is vandalism."
   
 The gardeners have brought in surveillance equipment to see who may be behind the thefts, which are happening mainly on the west side of the garden, directly across the pavilion on Avenue F.
   
 "During this time it really provides gardening therapy for people, to be out in their gardens and to grow their own food," Fornes said. "We have such an older population and they're not having to go to the grocery to get their vegetables.
   
 "If people are hungry, people were willing to help. There are other options we have," she said. "I get it that people are hurting. There are other avenues and we'd be more than willing to donate stuff if people are in need."
