But unluckily for me, I was assigned a middle seat at check-in despite there being scores of open window and aisle seats open. I couldn't help but feel American was once again punishing me for booking a basic economy ticket by assigning me that seat, even though we're in a pandemic.

Unlike Delta, there were few reminders of the airline's commitment to passenger safety and peace of mind on board. Tiny messages were shown on the information screen that read "We've enhanced our cleaning procedures for your safety" and "face covering required on board" but that was about it.

“I really love UVa and when this opportunity arose, it seemed like one that I could not pass up,” she said. “I also began crew this season and immediately loved the sport. I love volleyball and I love CNU, but when I had the opportunity to stay close to home and compete at a Division I level, it seemed like something I couldn’t pass up.”
 A two-sport standout for Western Albemarle in volleyball and basketball, the opportunity to join the Cavaliers' rowing program was very unique.
 Back in December, Driver was named to the Daily Progress Holiday Hoops Classic all-tournament team. After the game, she went out to eat dinner to celebrate. That celebration turned into the opportunity of a lifetime.
 “The way this happened is a pretty crazy story,” Driver said. “We went out to Qdoba, and while there, Coach [Kevin] Sauer came up to me and introduced himself as the UVa rowing coach. He asked me if I had ever rowed or thought about rowing. I replied that I had not, but after talking with him, I realized that it might be a sport that I would like to try.”
 Driver joined the crew team at Western Albemarle and quickly found her new calling.
 “I fell in love with the sport and now I cannot wait for the season to start,” she said. “I have a lot to learn, so I know that I am going to have to start by working really hard. I began working with Coach Craig [Redinger] at Western on my technique and he helped me learn how to do a lot of things.”

When the coronavirus pandemic began to spread through Colombia, creeping its way to the town of Uribia, the only information Angela Montiel could get about Covid-19 was from her neighbors.
 They told her a deadly virus "like a whooping cough" was gripping the country and had even hit the nearby city of Maicao. But she was skeptical it was so close to home. "I don't know if this is true," said 38-year-old Montiel, who is part of the country's largest indigenous group, the Wayuu.
 As much of the world locked down at home in recent months, billions watched the coronavirus crisis unfold through a seemingly universal window: the internet. But billions of other people don't even have access to the internet. Montiel is one of them.

It took less than 100 years for the institution of slavery to stamp out the notion of equality in the American south and replace it with racism. You know what happened next -- a civil war that pitted democracy against autocracy. Where a racist institution was strong, it supported a racist society. Where it was weak, ideas about racial injustice were able to take root and then thrive thanks to the conscious, concerted actions of a small-then-growing number of people committed to anti-racism.
 ## We can do this because we've done it before
 Of course, people who want to perpetuate racism know all about how it is passed down and around through institutional power. It is why they've always fought to keep blacks and other minorities _out_ of institutions, or to create their own separate racist ones. Those institutions have similarly had to be confronted with anti-racist action. They have no legacy of fixing themselves.
 In 1971, racist Evangelical Christian leaders fought hard to keep their segregated private schools tax exempt -- an effort to pass racism down to another generation. They lost that battle because of anti-racist action that resulted in the Supreme Court case Green vs. Connelly,  which was filed by a black Mississippi family that was justifiably angry that tax benefits were being given to a racist institution.
 Yet again a racist institution was only changed through sustained, concerted anti-racist actions -- the continuance of an ongoing struggle to diminish the influence of racism in our education system.

Other bugs found by Mayhem include one discovered earlier this year in the OpenWRT software used in millions of networking devices. Last fall, two interns at the company scored a payout from Netflix’s bug-bounty program after they used Mayhem to find a flaw in software that lets people send video from their phone to a TV.
