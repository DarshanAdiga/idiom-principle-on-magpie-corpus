Los detalles del estudio se publican hoy en la revista Proceedings of the Royal Society B.


  'El objetivo era estudiar una amplia gama de terópodos, dinosaurios carnívoros de dos patas, para entender patrones más amplios de crecimiento y evolución del grupo', explica Tom Cullen, autor principal del estudio en el Museo Field de Chicago y actualmente en el Museo de Ciencias de Carolina del Norte.


  Saber cómo un animal se hace grande es sorprendentemente difícil. Los mamíferos (también los humanos) suelen pasar por un período de crecimiento extremo en la juventud y después permanecen prácticamente en el mismo tamaño al llegar a la edad adulta, pero en otros grupos de animales, no siempre es así.


  'La tasa de crecimiento varía mucho; no hay una talla única para todos. Las aves tienen grandes picos de crecimiento y llegan al tamaño adulto muy rápido, mientras que los reptiles como los caimanes y varios lagartos y serpientes tienen un crecimiento prolongado. En ellos, si un individuo es muy grande, probablemente también será muy viejo', relata Cullen.


  Los distintos patrones de crecimiento son importantes porque pueden marcar la diferencia en la supervivencia: Crecer rápido puede ser una ventaja competitiva que facilita la caza y dificulta ser cazado pero, también, un crecimiento acelerado exige mucha energía y recursos.


  De hecho, 'la cantidad de calorías que el T. rex necesitaba para crecer era ridícula, como la de un adolescente que come dinosaurios en vez de enormes bocadillos', bromea Cullen.


  Para determinar cómo fue el crecimiento de estos icónicos dinosaurios, y dado que están extinguidos, la única manera de estudiarlos es usando el registro fósil, analizando el interior de los huesos que contienen pistas que revelan los patrones de crecimiento.


  'A medida que un animal crece, en el interior del hueso surgen unas marcas como los anillos de árboles que registran aproximadamente la edad del animal y cuánto crece cada año, entre otros factores', explica Cullen.


  Los investigadores seccionaron huesos de decenas de fósiles de animales, desde perros a avestruces, hasta llegar a 'Sue' el T. rex, más grande jamás descubierto (y uno de los mejor conservados del mundo), actualmente expuesto en el Museo Field de Historia Natural de Chicago.


  También analizar los huesos de una amplia gama de terópodos, entre ellos una nueva especie de carcharodontosaurio gigante de Argentina, el contrapunto directo a T. rex.


  Para analizar a Sue, los investigadores usaron un taladro con punta de diamante para cortar un pequeño cilindro del hueso y obtener así una muestra con líneas como los anillos de árboles que mostraban dónde había crecido el hueso nuevo año tras año. A continuación, cortaron muestras microscópicas del fragmento y las examinaron.


  El análisis descubrió que Sue vivió 33 años, lo que le convierte en el T. rex más viejo que se conoce.


  Además, Sue alcanzó su tamaño adulto a los 20 años pero para lograrlo, tuvo que aumentar su peso unos 20 kilos cada semana durante su adolescencia, mientras que sus primos más lejanos, los alosauroides, podían alcanzar tamaños casi tan grandes como el T. rex, pero crecían lentamente a lo largo de toda su vida, concluye el estudio.


  En cuanto al carcharodontosaruio argentino, el estudio determinó que alcanzó el tamaño de Sue pero no hasta la edad adulta, a los 30 o 40 años.


  Este ejemplar vivió hasta los 50 o más, convirtiéndose en el terópodo más antiguo del que se tiene constancia -aparte de algunas aves como los loros- y pese a su avanzada edad, solo dejó de crecer 2 o 3 años antes de morir, concluye el estudio. EFE

“Unfortunately, a lot of folks take for granted the small things that matter. I used to be one of those people. I have been at rock bottom, and I have been pretty close to what I consider "the top”. My dad said something to me a long time ago that I didn't really pay attention to when he said it. But he said, "if you got, give it, and it'll make you feel good" Again when he said it, it didn't sink in. He's gone now, but I get it now that I'm older. And it does…it makes you feel great to give to those in need. And not just the little bit of happiness buying something nice brings you. It's the true kind of joy that warms your heart and sticks to your soul! I donate what I can when I can to honor what my dad said, but also, I do it to show my children how to give. I hope the little bits that I'm able to give is enough to brighten someone's day, even if it is short lived,” Bradley said.

Writer-director-producer Alan Ball has never been one to shy away from trying to make people laugh or make them grimace or shudder or think or get caught up in emotional chaos. He also has great command of dialogue. For TV, he created and wrote "Six Feet Under" and "True Blood." His film writing credits include "Towelhead" and "American Beauty" (for which he won an Oscar).      With "Uncle Frank," he's conjured up all sorts of ways to have his characters and their story affect viewers, and he scores on just about every one of them. The film is being plugged as a coming of age story, but taken the way most people think of that term, it's an inaccurate description. Yes, the protagonist is 18-year-old Beth (Sophia Lillis), who has gotten away from the grip of her "proper" South Carolina family and headed to college in 1973 New York, where she can start exploring life - start "coming of age." But there's a second principal protagonist, Beth's Uncle Frank (Paul Bettany), a 46-year- old gay college professor who is trapped in a secretive way of life due to family-related events from his teen years. Frank is an adult who is still struggling to get past all of that and finally come of age.      Bookended by busy family gatherings at the big old Southern house - the opening one is for a birthday, the closing one is for a funeral - "Uncle Frank" tells many stories. The main ones are about the relationship between Beth and Frank ("Nobody else in my family ever seemed interested in me," she says in a voice-over), and the one between Frank and his partner Wally (Peter Macdissi), a happy, caring and loving man who managed to escape homosexual persecution in his native Saudi Arabia. To a lesser degree, but of equal importance, are glimpses of and bits of insight on different members of Beth's family: well-meaning but backward thinking younger brother Mike (Steve Zahn), sensitive mom (Margo Martindale), short-tempered homophobe dad (Stephen Root), and others.      Featuring both stern and shocking revelations as well as sparklingly funny scenes, Ball's script has conversations that allow some characters to understand how others tick. It shifts into road trip mode when Frank's complicated father dies and he must head back to South Carolina - and the family that doesn't know his secret (don't worry, he has company). And it unwaveringly delivers the message that you need to be who you are, no matter what anyone else thinks.      It's hard to pick out a "best performance" in the film. Sophia Lillis ("It") plays Beth with a wide-eyed curiosity and sense of adventure. Within the wonderful couple of Frank and Wally, Paul Bettany's Frank blends feelings of being relaxed and in turmoil, and Peter Macdissi's Wally is sweet and supportive, but also suggests, in a moment of seriousness, that there was once a line between him and Frank that must never again be crossed. In an unfortunately short amount of screen time, Stephen Root, as Daddy Mac, once again masterfully displays why he's such an in-demand character actor.      Any lightness in the film is obliterated by long-ago thoughts in Frank's head that are now brought to the fore by his return to the family home, and some of those scenes, presented in flashback, are traumatic to watch. As are some of the goings-on in the house, especially during the reading of Daddy Mac's will, where the film's dramatic impact approaches being overwhelming.      But Ball's skill with words and storyline and direction, and his ability to balance all of that into a thoughtful, poignant, searing, and unconventional story, make "Uncle Frank" a real treat, recommended to everyone with an open mind.      "Uncle Frank" premieres on Amazon Prime on Nov. 25.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Federal authorities say a South Carolina man has pleaded guilty to a terror charge for plotting to bomb or shoot up sites including the White House and Trump Tower in New York City in attacks inspired by the Islamic State group. Kristopher Sean Matthews pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge to provide material support to IS during a court hearing in San Antonio on Tuesday. Matthews admitted he conspired with 22-year-old Jaylyn Christopher Molina of Texas to share bomb-making information for the purposes of domestic and foreign attacks on behalf of IS. Matthews faces up to 20 years in federal prison when he is sentenced March 4.

But against this, our current expectation is that recurring revenue growth in FY '21 will be in the region of 3% to 5%. Given the profile of FY '20, we expect this growth to be weighted towards the second half of the year. Other revenue is expected to continue to decline in line with the strategy. And organic operating margin is expected to be up to 3 percentage points below last year, depending on the level of additional investment that we decided to make. And looking beyond FY '21, we expect margins to trend upwards over time as the investment drives recurring revenue growth and operating efficiencies. So to conclude, the business performed well in FY '20 with strong profit and cash generation. We've made continued progress on our strategic priorities, building a higher quality and more resilient business. And with Sage well positioned for further growth, we are confident for the future.

The one team many thought would pose a serious challenge, Haverford, battled for a little while but ultimately succumbed to the Jags' power running game and fast and furious defense. Garnet Valley is the Central League king and it will take a Herculean effort to unseat them Wednesday night.
 Marple Newtown, step right up.
 "It's something we've talked about a lot as a team, how we were going to deal with adversity this whole season and how important it was to stay focused on our goals," said Shane Reynolds, who has flourished at running back and linebacker this year for the Jaguars. Reynolds and senior Brian Bradley have paced a run offense averaging 6.6 yards per carry and 280 yards per contest.
 "We've dealt with social distancing, staying home when all you wanted to do was go out and practice," he added. "I know it's going to feel really good once it pays off."
 GV's success starts with the development of quarterback Kevin McGarrey, who has been the rare Garnet Valley QB finding consistent success throwing the football. Garnet Valley is known best for running the football, but McGarrey has shown he can do both. He has thrown for 473 yards and seven touchdowns.
 "Kevin has a great understanding of what we're trying to do on offense and he's done a great job running the offense and being the leader," GV coach Mike Ricci said. "He's just a very unselfish player who gets what we're trying to do and distributes the ball and keeps everyone involved."
 It's a shame that Wednesday evening is the end of the road for Garnet Valley. The Jags would have been a force in the District 1 Class 6A playoffs in a normal year. But the only thing that matters now is the Central League championship. A 25th straight league win would be the perfect coronation for the program.
 "It's the first time in a long time any of us has played the final game of the season knowing that it's a championship game and it's for all the marbles," McGarrey said. "It's win or go home and it's a great feeling."

Miami fans have seen 1st hand in the last two years how important a top HC to a team's success. I'm not going to predict Lawrence won't be a top QB, but the better odds are he'll be a top QB with a bad HC. Look at Miami and every 'bad' team this century. All of them have made multiple attempts to find 'the' HC and, for the most part, failed.
