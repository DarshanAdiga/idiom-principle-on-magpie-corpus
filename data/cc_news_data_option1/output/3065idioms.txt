Jackie uses her platform to advocate for Black women. Although she partners with tons of beauty and fashion brands, she doesn't think twice about calling them out about issues like lack of diversity, lack of advocacy, and inappropriately capitalizing off of the black dollar. After the murder of George Floyd, Jackie took to her Twitter account to call out brands like FashionNova and Pretty Little Thing for their silence on Black issues. More recently she cut ties with a beauty brand for continuing a partnership with a known racist.

You can't fault the NFL players who have decided to opt out of the 2020 NFL season. The reasoning is clear -- those players wanted to protect themselves, their parents, their children and, in a couple of cases, their unborn children from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Patriots have had a league-high eight opt-outs with Dont'a Hightower, Patrick Chung, Marcus Cannon, Brandon Bolden, Matt LaCosse, Dan Vitale, Marqise Lee and Najee Toran all deciding to take that route. But even for the players who opted to play, they admit the decision wasn't easy.
 On Sunday, four Patriots captains explained why they are playing this year. They admitted the choice to play wasn't easy, but they're heading into the season trying to remain optimistic. One of those players is David Andrews.
 No one would have been surprised if the Patriots center opted out. Last year, he missed the season due to blood clots in his lungs. He said after discussing his choices with his family and doctors, he is all-in for 2020.
 "My choice has been made," Andrews said. "Talking with doctors and my wife -- it's something we feel comfortable with. I'm just excited to get the chance to go out there and compete again."
 Andrews' situation is a rare one, but he isn't the only player who's dealt with health issues. Cannon is a survivor of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. When he opted out, it wasn't a surprise. Although it's a blow anytime you lose your right tackle, having Andrews back at center will help the Patriots move forward.
 Matthew Slater also has his own medical condition and reasons that would have made it understandable if he chose to opt out. The 34-year-old deals with asthma and has three small children at home. It was reported by the NFL Network that Slater nearly opted out. Slater's wife, Shahrzad, is a Providence-based doctor and he admitted the choice to play was really difficult after speaking with her.
 "With my wife having the background that she does as an MD, I think that she knows a little bit more and it made the conversation a little bit tougher," Slater said. "Obviously, my parents have their own concerns. I have a young family that I'm trying to raise. … It's been difficult. You want to make sure you're hearing from the Lord and doing what he wants you to do. You don't want to be selfish. You don't want to be just acting just on the spur of the moment or off emotions, whether it be fear or excitement, whatever it might be. We tried to be as prayerful about this as we could. We feel at a place of peace now. I think it's just a matter of us moving forward, continuing to pray and continue to support my family at 1 Patriot Place, continue to support the Slater family. There is no easy decision for this."
 Having the captain and Pro Bowl special-teamer back is important for the Patriots. The same goes for James White and Devin McCourty. White's wife, Diana, gave birth to their first child last season and she's currently pregnant again. McCourty and his wife, Michelle, have two children under 4.
 White is one of the best receiving backs in the NFL. After losing Chung, McCourty's services are certainly needed in the Patriots secondary. The team is certainly happy they're playing, but both recognize that the decision wasn't clear cut.
 "It's definitely not an easy decision," White said. "Little one at home, my wife is pregnant, so definitely a lot of consideration. It's definitely not an easy choice like Slate was saying. I don't want to be selfish knowing you love and want to play the game. But we want to protect our families at home, our teammates and coaches and everybody. Definitely a difficult choice, but I feel like we're trying to take the right steps and follow the precautions at the stadium.
 "We'll trust in one another to do the right things outside the locker room so we don't bring any unnecessary things into the locker room. At the same time, we all can do the right things and stuff still can happen. Just have to be as cautious as possible. Just keep everybody trusting in one another so we can all be safe."
 Players have a deadline to opt out (the date is Thursday) and anyone could change their mind.
 "I'm still out here having fun and figuring things out," McCourty said. "So, we'll see how we go."

Early Saturday morning, July 25, 2020, at MorningStar Assisted Living, Jack McNutt, loving husband, father/stepdad, grandfather and great grandfather, very peacefully passed away of natural causes at age 97.
 The only child born to Goldie and Ernest McNutt in San Francisco in March of 1923, at age three Jack’s family relocated to Long Beach, Calif. and then later to Los Angeles. After high school, he served in the Army Air Corp, mainly in the Aleutian Islands during WW II.

In 1992, he co-authored “Thriving with Reps,” a comprehensive guide for maximizing sales via manufacturers’ representative sales channels.
