But also this moment in Marie Curie’s life, when she was closer to Monica Lewinsky than Albert Einstein, when she was brutalized in the press, diminished, and this radical cruelty that she survived.”

It has gotten cold.
 Maybe it will have warmed up a bit by the time you read this, but when I woke up Thursday morning it was downright cold. I looked outside and the street was white, not from snow but from frost.
 A single set of tire marks bore witness to some brave soul who had already ventured out into the cold air.
 I was not far behind. For the second morning in a row I scraped ice off my windshield and windows before setting out.
 Yes, it has turned off cold.
 For those not familiar with the phrase “turned off cold,” it’s one I used to hear fairly often — mostly from older people — 35 or 40 years ago.
 Living in rural area of North Carolina during that time, I found myself using the phrase myself from time to time. It seemed then like a fairly routine, if somewhat quaint, way of acknowledging the change in the weather.
 Now it feels sort of nostalgic, a leftover from a bygone era when I had not heard of COVID-19, sports were played in their normal seasons, and people like Mickey Gilley, Don Williams and Dan Fogelberg were on the radio on a regular basis.
 I have sometimes wondered about the meaning or origin of “turned off cold.”
 I’m not sure precisely how it came about but for me it seems like a reference to turning off a path or road, and indicates a change of direction that could be subject to changing back on fairly short notice. You might turn off the path, but can return to it if you need to or want to.
 It shouldn’t seem surprising to me that it’s cold in November, but then again I was swimming in the ocean at Kitty Hawk just 10 days ago.
 So it seems sudden to me whether it is or not.
 And I figure the cold might not linger long. Often it comes quickly and just as quickly goes.
 I’m OK with that. I have chosen to live in a place where it sometimes gets cold but only rarely stays cold for any considerable length of time.
 I know there are some of you who love snow and maybe you’ll see some before Christmas.
 Or maybe you won’t. After all, weather predictions are tentative in this part of the world.
 I’m no big fan of snow but I’ll be as happy as anyone else if it snows at Christmas.
 I can only remember one or two white Christmases in North Carolina in my lifetime but it always feels extra special.
 Even a close call, say a snowfall that comes a week or so before Christmas and melts before Christmas Day gets here, is not too bad.
 But I’m still not packing my shorts away for the winter. I know it will be in the upper 70s at least within a couple of weeks.

On September 29, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and UN Environment Programme observed the first-ever International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste. They urged everyone to take action to reduce food loss and waste across the entire agricultural value chain.      This is a timely message. Today, in a world where food worth more than $1 trillion is lost or wasted every year, more than 800 million people are hungry. And the COVID-19 pandemic has only made the problem worse.      According to the FAO, one-third of food produced for human consumption worldwide is annually lost or wasted along the chain that stretches from farms to processing plants, marketplaces, retailers, food-service operations, and our households. And there are many factors that contribute to food loss including limitations on crop production and other resource-saving agricultural techniques, inadequate transport and storage infrastructures, changing climate and excess purchases and portions.      Surprisingly, the proportion of food produced but not consumed within developing and developed nations are similar. However, the reasons for food waste in developed and developing countries are significantly different.      In developing countries, food waste happens during food production and is mainly due to climate-induced crop failures and inadequate infrastructures to transport food to the market and to store it once it is produced. By contrast, in the developed world, food is wasted mainly due to consumers buying or cooking more food than they need. In addition, according to a 2016 survey by the Harvard Food Law and Policy clinic, many consumers throw away perfectly good food because of confusing expiry date labels.      Despite most of the wastage taking place at the very end of the value chain, developed countries contribute significantly to global food waste. In the US, approximately 36 million tonnes of food - between 30-40 percent of the food supply - is wasted every year. In the UK, households waste 4.5 million tonnes of food each year. In Australia, nearly 7.3 million tonnes of food is wasted.      Associated with food waste are the economic costs that arise from the resources used to produce food. Farmers, for example, use 1.8 billion pounds of nitrogen fertiliser and 1.5 billion pounds of phosphorous fertiliser annually to grow wasted crops while applying more than 750 million pounds of pesticide to protect food that often ends up wasted. According to FAO, "direct economic consequences of food wastage (excluding fish and seafood) run to the tune of $750bn annually".      All these depressing statistics can lead people to think individual actions would not make a difference. In the fight against food waste, however, everyone's contribution matters.      So what can individuals, businesses, organisations, and corporations do to stop food waste?      In developed countries, where consumers are responsible for most of the waste, every single person can play an important role in turning the tide. Simply by not buying more food than they can eat, consumers in the developed world can help significantly reduce food waste in their countries. Buying locally produced food, which does not face the risk of being spoiled during transport, can also help. Repurposing leftover food - especially after big celebrations like Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl and Eid - can also have a huge effect.      Individual consumers can also help the fight against food waste by sharing their concerns with the restaurants they dine in or the markets and shops they buy their groceries from. If consumers start to choose establishments that take action against waste over others, more businesses will implement policies to prevent food waste.      Businesses themselves can do a lot to prevent food waste. They can encourage their customers to take leftovers home, and they can donate any excess produce to those in need. There are organisations in most developed countries helping businesses repurpose surplus food. In the US, for example, Feeding America partners with farm owners, food manufacturers and businesses to rescue food that would otherwise go to waste and send it to food banks, food pantries and meal programmes.      Fighting food waste also makes business sense. In 2017, a study evaluating financial cost and benefit data from 700 companies in 17 countries, found that for every $1 companies invested to reduce food loss and waste, they saved $14 in operating costs. The savings that can be made by avoiding food waste is also very high for private households. So advertising the financial benefits of taking action against food waste too can speed up change.      In developing countries, where most of the food goes to waste because of climate-induced failures, meanwhile, efforts geared towards helping farmers access resource-saving agricultural techniques and climate-smart practices to ensure all planted crops are harvested will go a long way. Investing in new technologies that expand the shelf life of fresh produce can also help reduce post-harvest losses. Campaigns to increase awareness about the issue can also pressure governments to invest more money in food waste reduction. And while consumers have a relatively smaller effect on food waste in the developing world, individuals can still help the fight by making sure that their household is not wasting food.      In short, there is something we all can do to ensure tonnes of food do not go to waste while millions are struggling with hunger across the world. While collective action is crucial, especially in the developed world, individual consumers and businesses can also make a big difference simply by changing their habits and practices.

Despite orchestrating another envy-worthy season, Regis football can’t help but leave 2020 wondering what could have been.
 “It was probably the most difficult ending that we ever had,” Ramblers coach Bryant Brenner said.
 That end came early for Regis when the district shut down fall sports activities on Oct. 28 amid rising quarantine numbers at the school. That wiped out the Ramblers’ final two regular season football contests of the year, games against Fall Creek and Durand, as well as a chance to compete in this year’s two-week playoff format.
 Brenner, in his 13th season as Regis head coach, said everyone involved in the program is dealing with the ensuing emotions in their own way. A few weeks out from the decision, he’s personally coming to terms with it.
 “Each day it gets a little bit better,” Brenner said. “I think for me, it helps seeing the kids each day in school, to see their faces and talk to them a little bit. It was tough the way it ended and then being virtual for two weeks.”
 When Regis did play, the Ramblers were a force to be reckoned with. In a year with a normal playoff format, they certainly would have been considered a serious contender.
 Brenner’s crew went 5-0 in a new-look Cloverbelt, opening the year with a trio of impressive victories against Elk Mound, Mondovi and Stanley-Boyd before taking care of business in one-sided affairs with Neillsville/Granton and Osseo-Fairchild. Pretty good considering Brenner entered the year wondering what he should expect out of a somewhat inexperienced bunch.
 The rest of the Cloverbelt coaches were confident the Ramblers would figure things out, and they did quickly.
 Offensively, Zander Rockow fit right in after transferring from Thorp, leading a talented group of rushers with 448 yards and eight touchdowns. In total, five Rambler rushers reached the century mark this year, with Rockow joined by Peyton Mayer (313 yards, 6 TDs), Gus Theisen (299, 4), Drew Goettl (210, 2) and Aaron Haselwander (114, 2).
 Bennett Seelen commanded the offense under center for a second year, completing 11 passes for 222 yards and two scores.
 The defense kept teams under 14 points in every game. Payton Kostka, who led the team with 65 tackles, was named the Cloverbelt’s co-defensive player of the year last week. Rockow, a defensive lineman, and defensive backs Aaron Haselwander and JP Wolterstorff all earned first team all-conference recognition.
 “I thought we were really tough to run the ball against,” Brenner said. “Although we did give up some pass yards, we didn’t give up a lot of touchdowns.”
 The Ramblers graduate a 13-player class, including some notables at the skill positions. From an offensive perspective, Regis loses Mayer, Goettl and Aaron Haselwander in the backfield, the team’s second, fourth and fifth leading rushers, its QB Seelen and top receiver JP Wolterstorff. Many of the same players were leaders of the defense, which also needs to replace its top dog Kostka. David Haselwander rarely came off the field no matter if the offense, defense or special teams were being called upon.
 Also graduating in a class that helped Regis to a Division 6 state championship game appearance last year are RB/DB Alex Nunez, linemen Mac Lokken, Aiden Ritger, Matt Mauer and Jeremia Belden and OL/LB Kevin Byrne.
 Brenner gave credit to the seniors for stepping into leadership positions, helping carry the group when there were some growing pains early on.
 This season didn’t bring the postseason memories Regis players have gotten used to, but it wasn’t without signature moments. That included a bit of history, when Regis played its first ever game on school grounds against Stanley-Boyd. The Ramblers traveled to Mondovi in Week 2 and earned a shutout victory against the Buffaloes, fresh off a trip to the Division 6 semifinals, that served as early proof of this squad’s ability to shine in big moments.
 “A lot of those guys have witnessed really good football and they were hungry this year to take ownership of it, take ownership of the team,” Brenner said. “They did a great job of that. The last four years that those guys have been in school we haven’t lost too many games. When you take the sting of this season ending away and you look at their football career, they’ve had a really solid career.”

The NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority inquiry into the company’s suitability to operate a gambling business at its new $2 billion plus Barangaroo development heard the bombshell admission from Crown on Wednesday that evidence of money laundering had indeed been found in its bank accounts. But it came long after banks closed various accounts over their concerns, which chief executive Ken Barton was aware of. The scandal was aired in the media last year, including explosive leaked footage of a huge amount of cash being exchanged for gambling chips in a room dedicated to VIP high rollers. “What we saw was a person bringing hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash in a shopping bag into a casino in the middle of the night wrapped in elastic bands, wrapped in cellophane and handed over in wads,” counsel assisting Scott Aspinall told the inquiry on Friday. “In my submission you wouldn’t really need to see more than that to be able to reasonably suspect that it’s proceeds of crime – it speaks of someone trying to exchange ill- gotten cash.” Mr Barton had been shown at the inquiry in July the accounts were “riddled” with suspicious transactions and only conceded it was a worry afterwards. Mr Aspinall asked why information received from the banks was not taken seriously and why Mr Barton had to be “led by the nose” to an “obvious” and “irresistible” conclusion. “The concession that money laundering took place in those accounts was resisted by Crown month after month after month until the 18th of November,” Mr Aspinall said. “That says more than the fact that money laundering actually occurred in those accounts. “What is says is that this company is unable to govern itself because it cannot see the obviousness of money laundering when it is put before it and will not concede and co-operate with the regulator to agree to that proposition when it is as plain as a pikestaff that money laundering had occurred.” Crown had failed to enforce internal controls, and while it now argues improvements in that respect mean it is suitable to hold the licence, Mr Aspinall is far from convinced. He said the regulator would want to be sure Crown was “significantly strong to resist that maelstrom” of dodgy types targeting their venue for money laundering. “The policies are all very well, but what a regulator would need to see is a commitment and evidence that they are going to be enforced – it’s a cultural issue.” He said it was “commendable” Mr Barton now acknowledged the serious issues. “But that fact does not change the problem of how the regulator going forward could have any confidence that when faced with future problems, which will no doubt arise, that Mr Barton will be able to detect and act appropriately.” After this week’s admission, ILGA delayed the planned opening of Crown Sydney next month while the inquiry continued its investigation, with findings due to be handed down in February. Crown, whose biggest shareholder is reclusive billionaire and former director James Packer, says it will in the meantime focus on non-gaming parts of the business, such as restaurants.

Okay. Yes, I will start with that – with the commentary, Tommy, on the numbers and then Vic can add some qualitative comments. So I will start the test that was the least impacted in ‘20. So therefore going into ‘21, we anticipate that will be the least impacted. So that one really isn’t a contributing factor to the growth we see. So, let’s just set that one aside. On the A&D side, we see two things, one, the daily passenger boardings, the stabilization of the build rates, when we are at the back half of ‘20, there was so much uncertainty, Boeing and Airbus were freezing lines shutting things down this and that. So, it was a crapshoot trying to guess what build rates were and passenger miles were in the tank. And so now there is a lot more visibility, because obviously for them to maintain a supply chain with some level of substance, they have to give some guidance. So, we have pretty good level or deep level of guidance on build rates, so that helps a portion of it. And then the anticipation of passenger miles, we just kind of form an opinion based on the trends that we have seen over the last 6 to 8 weeks and kind of extrapolated as we go forward and that’s consistent with a lot of the things that we see in the consulting literature, whether it’s airline monitor and the TL report and things like that. And on the utility side, one more thing on the defense side, so the orders that we have booked into the Virginia Class, the percentage of completion or its cost across and as we ramp up in the first half, on the Block V, you really gain all the momentum in the second half of the year. So the correlation of the back half compared to the front half of ‘21 as a lot more Navy business that’s really easy to predict within that scenario. So on A&D, I’d say the most visible is the submarine business. Next is the stabilization of the build rates. And third is a reasonably conservative extrapolation of going forward of TSA boardings. On the utility side as we looked at Q4, it almost bought to a tie and so if you look sequentially from Q3 to Q4 in fiscal ‘20, you see a nice rebound. We are not declaring victory on that part, but we think that based on RFPs we have in front of us, based on things that Vic mentioned that new products, those will be coming into the market sometime in February and March. So they will benefit the back half of the year. And the most critical part of the service side is you can’t defer this maintenance forever, so they are pushing themselves around compliance structure such that they have to get something done in the field or they are going to be out of compliance with some of the things in their risk factors increase of outages and things like that. So, the visibility across the utility side is coming from new products, site visits increasing and the mere fact that they have to spend money, their utilities make money by spending money. And we are seeing that through the evidence of RFPs. The other thing that’s important from an EPS side is these cost actions that we took, especially in the USG side to restructure the footprint, if you will. We unfortunately had to take some people out. That will benefit the bottom line faster than the top line, because those fixed costs are gone and the variable costs are better aligned with the revenue. And so that’s what gives us confidence. And I think stylistically, we tend to be reasonably conservative. So we are not stretching ourselves outside the realm of reasonableness. So that was a relatively short answer for you.

_New York, 20 nov 02:00 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Joe Biden giovedì promette che non imporrà una chiusura a livello nazionale come parte del suo sforzo per controllare la diffusione del coronavirus. Lo riporta il sito "The Hill". "Non ho intenzione di chiudere l'economia, punto. Chiuderò il virus", ha detto Biden. "Lo dirò d Il presidente eletto ha detto che c'è un ampio accordo su come ottenere un aiuto economico per gli Stati, fornire un vaccino gratuito a tutti e fornire ulteriori finanziamenti per la Guardia Nazionale. Biden ha anche detto che c'è il sostegno per rendere obbligatorio indossare la mascherina a livello nazionale. "Abbiamo discusso l'attuazione di un mandato nazionale con la maschera - 10 governatori, democratici e repubblicani, hanno imposto requisiti e riconosciuto la necessità di un mascheramento universale", ha detto Biden. "Nord, sud, est e ovest". Non è una dichiarazione politica. È un dovere patriottico". (Nys)

United States Space Command (USSPACECOM or SPACECOM) is a unified combatant command of the United States Department of Defense, responsible for military operations in outer space, specifically all operations above 100 kilometers above mean sea level.
 The Space Command is the newest of 11 unified commands in the Department of Defense. Space Command increases the ability of the Joint Force to project power and influence, reduces decision timelines for space operations, and brings focused attention to defending U.S. interests in space.
 Proponents of the bid say Selfridge would amply meet the security, data transmission, and space requirements for the approximately 1,400 military and civilian personnel working in the new headquarters. In addition, the base has more than 111,000 square-feet readily available in four vacant buildings that could be used during an initial mission standup phase or as supplemental space when a new building is constructed.
 It was the second straight loss for the county in landing a military installation.
 In April, the Air Force decided against stationing a fleet of F-35 Lightning II aircraft at Selfridge, instead opting for locations in Alabama and Madison. Wisc.
 Still, Hackel remained upbeat about the future of Macomb County and its "hometown Air Base."
 "We now have some political clout with our Democratic senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow, our Democratic governor and now a Democrat in the White House," he said. "That is going to make things favorable for us.
 "I can't say much about it now, but we've got something big in the works."

BEIJING, Nov 19: Beijing on Tuesday praised a British diplomat who was filmed diving into a river in southern China to save a drowning student, a rare warm moment between two countries at loggerheads over human rights.   Britain's mission in the southwestern city of Chongqing said Monday that Consul General Stephen Ellison leapt into action at the weekend to save a woman who had fallen into a river coursing through a nearby tourist town.   The video on Chinese social media -- viewed more than 170 million times in China -- shows Ellison pulling off his shoes and jumping in to rescue the woman, who was floating face down.   "I think he should be commended for his act of bravery. I'd like to give him a big, big thumbs up," said foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a routine briefing Tuesday.    -AFP
