MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin's partial presidential recount entered its fourth day Monday, with very few changes in vote totals as President Donald Trump's attorneys appeared to be focused on a legal challenge seeking to toss tens of thousands of ballots, including the one cast by an attorney for the campaign.
 Democrat Joe Biden won the state by about 20,600 votes and his margin in Milwaukee and Dane counties was about 2-to-1. Those are the only counties where Trump paid to have a recount.
 Trump's attorneys have objected to counting any absentee ballots where voters identified themselves as “indefinitely confined;” where information on the certification envelope is in two different ink colors, indicating a poll worker may have helped complete it; and where there is not a separate written record for it having been requested, including all in-person absentee ballots.
 All of those ballots were being counted during the recount, but could be targeted as part of a Trump legal challenge.
 Discarding ballots as requested by Trump's campaign would result in Trump’s Wisconsin attorney, Jim Troupis, having his ballot not count, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Troupis, a former Dane County judge, voted early using the state’s in-person absentee option along with his wife. They were both listed on exhibits Troupis presented to the Dane County Board of Canvassers on Sunday that the Trump campaign argued had voted illegally.
 Troupis did not immediately respond to a text message Monday seeking comment.

 In 2015, the LDF emerged victorious only in half the 44 wards but managed to save face and come to power with Independent support. A rebel-plagued Congress held on to 12 seats, while the BJP, which last won a seat here in 2000, not only scooped up five wards, but finished a close second in 14.
 This time, the LDF is confident it will secure a comfortable majority to retain the municipality and be able to provide continuity in governance.
 With a seasoned leader like former CPI(M) area secretary P.K. Rajmohan in the forefront, the LDF hopes to capture at least 32 seats and cement its hold on the council. The presence in the fray of five party area committee members, including former municipal vice chairperson K.K. Shibu and CITU national council member V. Kesavan Kutty, is reassuring.
 The problems that have bogged down the State government recently will not have much of an impact here for people’s concerns are development at the local level, says CPI(M) area secretary Sreekumar T.
 Two rounds of campaigning are over, and a convention of LDF candidates in 44 wards will be followed by ward-level conventions and family meetings, says Mr. Sreekumar.
 The Congress is contesting all 44 wards this time. Though tight-lipped about the frontrunners for the chairperson’s post, the party is projecting DCC general secretary J. Jose Franklin and former municipal chairperson S.S. Jayakumar as its main candidates. The name of Leader of the Opposition in the past council A. Lalitha is doing the rounds as a possible vice chairperson candidate.
 The party has completed a couple of rounds of campaigning, and is set to distribute door-to-door a ‘charge sheet’ containing unkept promises of the LDF-ruled council, says Neyyattinkara block Congress committee president Venpakal Avaneendrakumar.
 A former councillor from Chundavila A. Prabha has left the Congress and joined the NDA to contest the polls, but Mr. Avaneendrakumar downplays it saying the candidate's loyalties were questionable. He also claims it is after long that the party is not facing rebel trouble.
 The BJP is optimistic it will improve its tally to 24 seats and bag the majority in the council. R. Rajesh, BJP Neyyattinkara Assembly constituency president, says they not only won five seats last time, but lost out the top spot in 14 wards by less than 20 votes. Taking that into account and the work done by the party in these five years, the party has reasons to feel confident.
 The BJP is contesting in 42 wards.,The BJP's poll plank is the 'failures' of both the LDF and the UDF on the development front, particularly town development, indoor stadium, refreshment centres for travellers, electric crematorium project, and waste management.
 However, the BJP is facing rebel trouble with former party councillor from Nilamel V. Harikumar contesting as an Independent after he was denied a ticket in Alumoodu ward in favour of Manchathala Suresh, Karshaka Morcha district general secretary. The party hopes to extend the olive branch to Mr. Harikumar and persuade him to backtrack, says Mr. Rajesh.
 While R. Lekha of the CPI(M) has joined the Congress to contest from Ooruttukala ward, rebel trouble has reared its head in a couple of wards. The LDF though is not too perturbed, saying they are faring much better than their opponents.

"I'm thrilled to also say that he explains the truths in our language, which is Anishinaabemowin," Talaga said.
 "I'm just really excited to bring our language to a wider audience."
 Talaga said Achneepineskum was the survivor of three residential schools and has been an important figure in her life, helping her learn about her ancestral history.
 He was also the cousin of Chanie Wenjack, a 12-year-old Ojibwe boy who died while trying to escape an Ontario residential school in 1966. Wenjack's story inspired late musician Gord Downie's multi-platform "Secret Path" project.
 Talaga talks about her life and her relationship with Achneepineskum in the first episode, which is about the teaching of love.
 In the episode on "truth," Talaga looks at the case surrounding Barbara Kentner, a First Nations woman who died after being hit by a metal trailer hitch thrown from a moving car in Thunder Bay in January 2017.
 The trial for the man accused in the killing, Brayden Bushby, recently began in Thunder Bay with a decision expected on Dec. 14. He admitted to throwing the hitch that hit Kentner, and pleaded guilty to aggravated assault. But his lawyer has argued Bushby is not guilty of manslaughter.
 The episode features Kentner's sister Melissa, who was walking with her when she was hit by the hitch, and journalist Willow Fiddler.
 "It's an episode of what I see as an Indigenous woman, what I see about Thunder Bay, what I see about Canada, and how the country still has a long way to go in recognizing what our truths are, accepting our truth, in order for change," Talaga said.
 Every instalment of "Seven Truths" features people from communities in the north and explores their lives. Other guests include prominent lawyer Julian Falconer, whose work has focused on Indigenous-side representation.
 "I feel that this series is something different," Talaga said. "You're not going to hear storytelling like this anywhere else, I don't think."

 It is the culmination of years of planning, including a seven-month restoration by special effects and makeup artist Greg Nicotero.
 The shark is expected to be a major draw for the museum, which plans to open its doors to the public on April 30 2021.
 Super fans know that the Jaws crew started calling the shark Bruce after Spielberg’s lawyer Bruce Ramer.

They were able to remove the rose-colored glasses in the post-championship fog and take real stock of their weaknesses as a roster, and for all the crowing about criticism of the team's construction being over the top last season, this front office clearly recognized there was legitimacy to some of it. They needed more playmaking and added Schröder to the backcourt and Gasol to the frontcourt. They had to let a veteran 3-and-D wing go to make the Schröder deal happen and managed to pick arguably the best one up off the free agent market in Matthews. Howard's presence last year was terrific, but he wasn't as versatile as they'd like to be able to play against every team and so they let him walk to Philadelphia and landed Gasol, who won't be the shot-blocker Howard was but gives them the aforementioned playmaking and shooting Howard couldn't.

One player that will be able to help fill that void down low is another returnee who got some reps in the starting lineup last year in junior Nick Mundy. He emerged to have a fantastic sophomore campaign and is somebody Ryan will be expecting to take on an even bigger role this season — showing the ability to be one of the Bluejackets' best scoring options and will often be asked to guard the opponent's best player.
 The rest of the minutes will be up for grabs within a large junior class that includes Connor Fields, Andrew Shepherd, Juan Arroyo-Asbury and Rayce England. All of them played mostly JV in 2019-20 but will have a chance at making a bigger splash at the varsity level this year.
 After seeing the makeup of this Mitchell team last year while serving as an assistant coach at PLAC rival Orleans, Ryan realizes it will be difficult to make up for the production of those now-departed seniors from last season. But he also believes his players can build off what the former players and coaches left behind for this program.
 "Doug did a great job with this team last year and from watching them at Orleans, I thought the kids always played hard," Ryan said. "They had a lot of talent last year and had a lot of kids that could really score with Michael Bell and Bear and Edric and Luke LaFevor played his hind end off every night. But for us, it's not going to just be one guy. It's going to be by committee. In the first week of practice, we really tried to challenge our seniors, not necessarily with scoring or anything that specific, but just building a culture and an energy and an enthusiasm to be in the gym."
 The season hasn't even started and Ryan and his players have already been through quite a bit of adversity.
 But through this difficult period, Ryan and his coaching staff came up with the phrase, "win the wait," to encourage the players to make the most of their time alone and away from the gym.
 Even though the Bluejackets are back to practicing, there's still a bit of a waiting period before they can step out on the court for their first game after the recent schedule changes.
 And that means there is still time to learn and get better from these obstacles that have gotten in their way so far.
 In Ryan's eyes, that's how his team can still "win the wait."
 "It's all about challenging the kids," Ryan said. "For some of them, this could be their last year and tomorrow's not guaranteed. So whatever we get, whether that's one game or 20 games, we have to make the most of it. There's stuff, not just this, but stuff in life that you can't control, so you just have to control what you can control and get better as much as you can. That way, when we are able to be in the gym, we're that much more prepared."
 Mitchell is currently scheduled to open the 2020-21 season at home against Crawford County on Dec. 4.

 Dallas responded with its best game on the ground this season, and Dalton was sacked just once, with the quarterback taking the blame because he said he held the ball too long.
 Safety Donovan Wilson, who forced two fumbles against the Vikings, didn’t start until Week 5 at a position the Cowboys have had trouble solving.

David Bass continued his recent good run in the saddle after Bannixtown Glory completed his second double in the space of three days with victory at Kempton
 The 32-year-old again demonstrated he is riding at the top of his game with an enterprising front-running victory aboard the Donald McCain-trained 12-1 chance in the Listed Racing TV Mares’ Hurdle.
 Despite facing a host of challengers late on in the extended three-mile prize, the six-year-old rallied gamely under Bass before defeating recent Hereford scorer Getaway Totherock by a length and three-quarters.
 McCain – who won the race in 2009 with the smart Whiteoak – said: “There were plenty of question marks over a lot of them regarding the trip, but one thing you can rely on with her is that she turns up every time and the ground and trip were fine.
 “We were hoping to get a little bit of black type and between the last two I thought we would be hard done by if she didn’t get it, but she got more than we hoped for and is set for life.
 “I would imagine Charlotte (McCracken) will breed from her and that makes a big difference to her CV. She deserved that win, as she is as tough as nails.”
 Kim Bailey equalled last season’s total of 32 winners after Ajero (10-11) – who is a half-brother to the yard’s Grade Two winner Charbel – got the ball rolling for Bass when getting the better of Captain Morgs by a length in the EBF Stallions “National Hunt’ Novices’ Hurdle.

Phil has created this lush orchard by diverting water from the mountaintop -- and if you don't think thoughtless exploitation of the environment isn't going to come back and hurt him later, welcome to the world. When he and Hope aren't condescending to the Croods, they're scheming to get Eep out of the picture so that Dawn can get together with Guy.

Bruce, the fiberglass shark made from the “Jaws” mould, is ready for his close-up. The 1,208 pound, 25-foot-long, 45-year-old shark, famous for being difficult to work with on the set of Steven Spielberg’s classic thriller, on Friday was hoisted up in the air above the main escalator of the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles where he will greet guests for the foreseeable future. And this time, he co-operated.
 It is the culmination of years of planning, including a seven-month restoration by special effects and makeup artist Greg Nicotero. The shark is expected to be a major draw for the museum, which plans to open its doors to the public on April 30, 2021.
 Super fans know that the “Jaws” crew started calling the shark Bruce after Spielberg’s lawyer Bruce Ramer. They’ll also know that the Bruce that will greet guests in the museum wasn’t technically in “Jaws.” He's a replica and it’s the last of his kind. The three mechanical Great Whites designed by art director Joe Alves were destroyed when production wrapped. But once the film proved to be a box office phenomenon, a fourth shark was made from the original mould. For 15 years he hung at Universal Studios Hollywood as a photo opportunity for visitors until he wound up at the Sun Valley junkyard he would call home for the next 25. Nathan Adlan, who inherited his father’s junkyard business, donated him to the museum in 2016.
 But Bruce wasn’t quite camera ready. A quarter century in the California sun, plus all the years of being re-painted at Universal had taken its toll on the poor creature, who badly needed care and attention. Nicotero, who has worked on “Day of the Dead” and “The Walking Dead,” said he got into the business because of “Jaws” and volunteered for the task of bringing him back to life.
 “One of the great things about being the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is that we have access to Academy members in all craft areas of the industry,” said Academy Museum Director Bill Kramer. “We can call on our members and other members of the film industry who have either worked on the film that the artifact is from or know enough about the provenance and work that had been done to help us restore it. We’re in an incredibly privileged position.”
 Restoration was one thing, but loading Bruce into the museum proved to be another ordeal. Pritzker Prize-winning architect Renzo Piano made sure to account for large-scale objects in his restoration of the Saban Building, which was originally the May Company department store. But Bruce is their biggest piece to date and everyone soon realized that he wouldn't be able to get into the building with his fins attached.
 Last week Bruce was transported from a storage facility on a 70-foot flatbed to the museum at Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard where engineers, construction workers and art handlers removed two panels of glass three stories up to get him into the building. Once inside with fins reattached and a final touching up, Bruce was hooked onto five cables, each of which could hold his weight if any were to fail, and hoisted up on a truss by remote control to get into position in the building’s “spine” where he faces East and is visible from Fairfax.
 Shraddha Aryal, Vice-President of Exhibition Design and Production, described the years of painstakingly detailed modeling and work that went in to preparing for this moment, including full scale mock-ups and light tests to ensure that all of Bruce’s 116 teeth would be visible to tourists.

Public health officials in Kern and San Bernardino counties said they had not received notifications.
 Other documents showed facility leaders refused to cooperate with public health authorities. In an email exchange May 19, San Diego Public Health Department epidemiologist Adriana Villasenor recommended to Assistant Warden Joseph Roemmich that all Otay Mesa Detention Center staff get tested.
 Villasenor said the California Department of Public Health “is more strongly urging facilities with outbreaks to employ this to get a good baseline of asymptomatic staff and residents (to help mitigate spread).”
 Roemmich responded, “Just so we’re clear — at this point we have no intention to mass test our staff.”

If it all shakes right, they'll be prohibitive favorites once again no matter what else happens with the Clippers and Bucks and the rest, but questions certainly persist. If Schröder's shooting uptick from last year is real, he's a massive upgrade in the backcourt. If not, he's not really an upgrade from Rondo. If Harrell's playoff issues were the result of his absence and not a referendum on him as an 82-game player compared to a 16-game one, he'll inject some much-needed life into the bench unit. If not, he might find himself on a shorter leash than Doc Rivers provided a year ago. If Gasol's shakiness at times in the Celtics series was simply a bad seven-game stretch and not signs of decline, he's a delightful fit alongside LeBron as two of the great modern basketball savants. If not, Lakers fans will be pining for Howard's athleticism as Gasol plods along.

The Amazon Prime series, Made In Italy, includes an episode focusing on another important chapter in his career promoting Italian fashion as a system, his organization of Idea Como, which he engineered as a place for designers and textile makers to meet.
 Giorgio Armani recalled their early days in Milan, both as outsiders, Armani having arrived from the Lombardy province of Piacenza and Beppe from the neighboring Piedmont region.
 “This perhaps gave us more enthusiasm, a desire to invent a life and a job that we tried and tested, day in, day out,” Armani said in tribute. “Beppe dealt with public relations with the elegance and taste that everyone has always appreciated, but also with a different organizational and, I would say, political vision. A system had to be organized: the pret-a-porter system, and he did it so well that it still bears his mark today.”
 Modenese was also remembered by conductor Riccardo Muti, who wrote in a tribute published in Corriere della Sera, that he got to know the fashion protagonist during the two decades that Muti was music director of La Scala, which Modenese frequented with his partner Piero Pinto.

The inquiries by Boebert, who runs Shooters Grill, come as guns remain a passionate issue for both parties, fueled by images of demonstrations by armed Trump supporters, conservative pushes to ease state gun restrictions and recent years' mass shootings.
 Even so, prospects for significantly changing federal gun laws seem scant as a new, narrowly divided Congress takes office in January alongside President- elect Joe Biden.
 Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki did not respond to a reporter’s questions about the department’s communications with Boebert and the number of lawmakers who carry firearms.
 The agency's officials did not answer directly when Democrats on the House Committee on Administration asked in 2018 how many lawmakers carry firearms in the Capitol. The officials said in a written response that they've “been made aware” of inquiries about carrying weapons.
 “There is no standing requirement” that lawmakers notify them when they carry a firearm in the Capitol, the officials wrote. Regulations require safe storage of weapons, but “that responsibility resides with the Member,” they said.
 A 1967 regulation says no federal or District of Columbia laws restricting firearms “shall prohibit any Member of Congress from maintaining firearms within the confines of his office" or “from transporting within Capitol grounds firearms unloaded and securely wrapped."
