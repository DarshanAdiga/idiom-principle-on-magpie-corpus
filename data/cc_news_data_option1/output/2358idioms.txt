As a citizen of Mount Vernon, I am writing this unconditional letter of support for the Mount Vernon police and Skagit County sheriff's departments.
 I participated in and completed the Mount Vernon Police Department Citizens Academy. It provided an extensive and transparent look into police operations, policies, personnel and community networking. Officers at every level of the department provided classes. That weekly face-to-face interaction also provided an opportunity to get to know our officers and volunteers on a professional and personal level. These officers are sons and daughters of local families, parents of children who go to our schools, and they are our friends and neighbors.
 Clearly, our city resources are always a work in progress. Times change, and so does our culture. However, there are some necessary ingredients to a thriving, healthy, safe and free community. One of those is an efficient, empathic, understanding and community-based policing component.
 Unfortunately, a small portion of our population, for a variety of issues, pose a risk to that sense of community that the vast majority of our population expects and treasures. The dedicated officers and volunteers of our police and sheriff’s departments provide 24/7 support and heartfelt commitment to ensure a peaceful community. Our community-based departments have long been models for the rest of the nation.

Another debate that has emerged in the protest movements is about some of the historical figures linked to slavery, racism, colonialism and oppression. There had been some demolitionsand vandalism of their statutes in several countries. Even some of the reasonable progressive leaders have expressed the view that those monuments should be kept as they are historical figures. It is acceptable that most of these historical figures may have both positive and negative traits. However the protesters ask why their statues are kept in public,if not to justify racism, slavery, colonialism and oppression? They further argue that those statutes/monuments obviously could go to Museums, and their role to history books. Even if these arguments are correct vandalism or violence probably is not the way to go about it.

BYRON Shire Council asks independent consultants to conduct a community survey to measure residents’ views every two years.
 The 2020 survey results are back and residents are more satisfied overall, and across more areas, than in 2018.
 According to a report that will go before the council’s ordinary meeting next week, levels of community satisfaction with the council have “improved significantly over the last two years and have returned to above 2013 levels”.
 The biggest issues for residents this year were the condition and maintenance of roads (18 per cent listing this in their top two priorities), affordability and availability of housing and land (16 per cent) and managing development (11 per cent).
 When viewed against other regional LGAs, Byron Shire residents place a “comparatively higher level of importance” on bikeways and bicycle facilities, public transport, recycling services, sewerage management services and parking.
 But locals are less bothered about sporting facilities, parks and playgrounds, swimming pools and public art than residents in other areas.
 “Overall, the 2020 results are positive but there is always room for improvement and, based on the results, the report recommends future focus on a number of key areas,” council staff said in their report.
 Micromex Research, the firm that completed the survey, recommended the council keeps engaging with the community “about the future of the area”, “clarify service level expectations regarding infrastructure in the area, and continue to address the issue of
 roads” and “understand resident needs in terms of the affordability of housing in the area”.
 Mayor Simon Richardson said the survey was a great tool to check in with the community.
 “We want to keep improving and are committed to pushing ourselves hard as an organisation to do our best, and we know we sometimes fall a touch short, but it is pleasing our efforts are being noticed and appreciated as more than three quarters of residents, 78 per cent, are somewhat to very satisfied with council,” Cr Richardson said.
 “This is a significant improvement on the 2018 results when only 64 per cent of people said they were satisfied with council’s performance.”
 In 2020 residents were more satisfied with 37 out of 39 services provided in the Byron Shire including parks and playgrounds, quality of town centres, community consultation and the processing of development applications.
 “In 2018 residents told council they wanted more investment in upgraded community infrastructure and so we did major work on Railway Park, Waterlily Park, Gaggin Park and the Bangalow Parklands; we’ve upgraded skateparks in Brunswick Heads and Federal and have started work on Mullumbimby,” Cr Richardson said.
 “We’ve delivered five new bridges in the Bangalow area, built new fish- friendly causeways and bridges and we’re refurbishing the magnificent South Arm Bridge at Brunswick Heads.
 “Levels of resident satisfaction with local roads slightly improved over the last two years but there’s still a long way to go.
 “With current record levels of investment going into local roads, we hope to see the improvement in satisfaction with roads continue to increase over the next two years.”
 The 2020 Community Survey Report is available on the council’s website.

In the case of Chhattisgarh, the catchment of a major dam is at stake which could put water security of the state at risk in the long run, environmentalists say. The opencast mining as proposed in almost every block of the area could not only wipe out 50% of the forest but also advance the silting speed of the dam, minimising its live storage capacity year by year, they say.

It's always a challenge to figure out how to begin a movie, to choose what the very first shot should be. That task is handily and appropriately and endearingly accomplished in this documentary about fathers. It opens with 39-year-old video footage of its director - Bryce Dallas Howard - being born, and her dad - Ron Howard - right there in the delivery room, getting it on tape.      For her first time as a feature director - she's previously done shorts and episodic TV - Howard maintains a refreshing approach to her subject, while at the same time playing it relatively safe. The idea was to interview a bunch of dads, in separate sessions, all being asked the same or at least similar questions. For instance, "In simplest terms, what is a father?" Or, "Do you remember the first time you held your baby?" That's the playing it safe part. Even though there's a variety of answers, it's the repetition of those sorts of questions that keeps the film running smoothly on-track.      The refreshing approach is that Howard who, by being in show business, knows a lot of people in show business, fills the film's roster with celebrity dads, among them Judd Apatow, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O'Brien, Will Smith, and her own dad. They each stand in a large empty space, in front of a colorful blank wall, answering the questions being asked by her, off-camera.      She ups the ante and makes the film more accessible by slyly turning those instantly recognizable, familiar men into something like background characters. She keeps cutting back to them as they answer questions, make comments, smile, and laugh and, in a couple of cases, shed a few tears. But she keeps the main focus on a gaggle of everyday, non-celebrity dads from around the world. They also answer questions and make comments. But they're not on a soundstage; they're at home, interacting with their kids, both as they're being interviewed and in a plentiful supply of their own home movies.      There's Glen Henry, who explains how much fun it is as well as how difficult it is to be the father of three kids. There's Robert Selby, a single dad whose son has had major health problems since birth, talking about and showing us how close they are. The same-sex couple of Rob and Reece Scheer discuss the wild ride it's been since they adopted four kids in six months. The most compelling segment, in Tokyo, features Shuichi Sakuma, who became a late-in- life father only after overcoming his own health issues.      These unknown guys are the meat and potatoes of the film, and they provide the most insight to the subject. But Howard's structure has things regularly jump back to the well-known folks for some candid frosting on the cake: Judd Apatow admits that upon finding out his wife was pregnant, he wasn't the least bit prepared for what was to come. Conan O'Brien adds, "We're all making this up as we go. There's no school for this." Neil Patrick Harris brings up that fatherhood has increased his sleep deprivation. Ron Howard, comically and unexpectedly letting a couple of curse words slip out, talks about how wonderful the early years are, "up till about 12." Will Smith is excitable and hilarious. Howard's younger brother Reed, whose wife's due date is a month away, is seen grappling with the installation of a car seat.      These are all deeply caring people. Some of them wonder and worry if they're around their kids enough and even if they're around them too much. Some of the answers are very sweet, but are matched up with an awareness of responsibility. To her credit, Howard has balanced everything to make the film both funny and profound.      "Dads" is available on Apple TV+ starting June 19.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Dads"   Directed by Bryce Dallas Howard   With Judd Apatow, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O'Brien, Ron Howard, Will Smith   Rated TV-14

Resale value is another reason to steer clear of extra-long car loans. If you plan on selling your vehicle when it is paid off, a 5-year-old car is more desirable and more valuable in the used car marketplace than one that's 7 years old. On average, a 5-year-old car will have lost about 48% of its value when new. A 7-year-old car will have depreciated by about 59%. Put another way, the new vehicle in our example will be worth roughly $19,240 after five years. It drops to $15,170 at the seven-year mark.

Guitarist Jim Robitaille was having a busy year, with the release last October of "A View From Within," which featured him playing with saxophonist Dave Liebman and members of Liebman's band, and the April 24 release of "Space Cycles" with Robitaille's own trio. And of course that was all squeezed in between teaching at UMass-Dartmouth, where his work on the faculty includes teaching jazz guitar and leading jazz ensembles, which often allow the students to jam with visiting jazz luminaries.
 Robitaille lives in New Bedford, so it's natural he's on Whaling City Sound, the superb jazz label that Neal Weiss founded several years ago. The other members of the trio are also area natives, with bassist Bill Miele living in Providence, and drummer Chris Poudrier a Lakeville resident.
 "I had met Neal years ago, and knew him as a fan of the music long before he started the label," said Robitaille from his New Bedford home. "Anybody in the New England area and beyond knew Neal for that. It's great having Whaling City right here and everything they do all comes from his passion and love of music."

 Robitaille had been looking forward to a tour of Europe for three weeks in April, including a recording date in Vienna where he'd be accompanying a jazz trumpeter. All of those dates were canceled or postponed and he was devoting himself to promoting the new record. The trio had the foresight to make a couple of videos during their sessions, so Robitaille was working with media and radio stations to offer those videos and do all the usual work to get the word out.
 But as April turned into May, Robitaille's world encountered more upheaval as his mother contracted COVID-19 and died near the end of the month. That forced him to cancel a couple of online appearances and since his last live performance was March 13, he said he's eager to get back in the action.
 "I had a nice month or so of pre-promotion for the April 24 album release but then the last month has been crazy," said Robitaille. "I think we've all been writing a lot and trying to get back to regular life. The ensembles are a big part of what I do at the college and those are not happening the rest of this term or in the fall. There are a lot of cuts and concentration on the mandatory classes needed for degrees, so the pandemic has affected a lot of things."
 While Robitaille has played with a variety of artists in a wide array of formats over the years, the trio is one of his most comfortable settings. That's evident on the new record, where the threesome displays that sort of musical telepathy that proves they are simpatico in every way.
 "I've been working with Bill and Chris way longer in other settings, with different artists over the years," said Robitaille. "We had done a lot of work in a quartet with a pianist that was booked a lot. But at the jam sessions at UMass-Dartmouth, I encourage the students to come up and jam and a lot of those sessions are done with my trio. This record has kind of come out of that, but the truth is that we've known each other long before that.
 "This album came out of concerts and club dates we'd played," Robitaille said. "We do have something special, where, when you're in the music you feel like you're tapping into each other. Everybody is in tune collectively, so that the music is conversational, reactionary in a way. You feel like you know where somebody is going next. We've had a lot of time developing that feeling."
 The new album certainly showcases how much variety a talented trio can deliver, from the bright and enticing "Natural Selection" where the fluidity of Robitaille's playing is just magnificent, to a lightly swinging cover of "Baubles, Bangles and Beads," to the mid-tempo canter of "February 12th," where the trio takes us on a subtle melodic trip, anchored by Robitaille's sterling chords. "Transitions" is a remarkable piece and not just because the liner notes tell us it travels through all 12 keys, but more because its sprightly melody carries it along so effortlessly those technical aspects are secondary.
 "That's how I really meant that song to turn out," said Robitaille. "You never really compose from a technical standpoint and I think all of that is working in the background. What's guiding 'Transitions' is the melody, which is actually very simplistic, almost sing-song. But the guiding force for me is always melody -- it all comes from a lyrical element, because I sing all of this stuff when I'm composing. I think it's an involuntary response -- it's impossible for me to hear music and not get to sing."
 The title cut, "Space Cycles," begins with tentative notes, two- and three- note chords, with the drums percolating underneath. A bass solo is the catalyst that propels it into a gliding jazz-fusion melody that is utterly transporting.
 "'Space Cycles' has two main movements; the first is very tight, with the rhythm section delivering funk in a different way, and then the second part is more contrasting that," Robitaille noted. "But then we have bass and drum solos, so really it has four sections. But there is a kind of life force to it -- sometimes when writing, the challenge is just to get out of the way. I had written that first section really fast, but probably had about six versions of the second part, because I never was satisfied with them. This one is the version we had been playing live most often, and we have finally settled on it."
 The album's two ballads, the romantic reverie "When We Passed" and the whimsical "Never Never Land," have Robitaille playing on his nylon-stringed acoustic guitar, yet with the kind of understated majesty that marked Wes Montgomery's best.
 "I have studied classical guitar, and I always had a love of Brazilian music," Robitaille said of the acoustic tunes. "It can be tricky playing with drums and acoustic guitar, because you can only get so loud. We can make it work in the studio but it is hard to do it live and find that balance."
 Probably the most commented on number is Robitaille's cover of the Beatles' "Here There and Everywhere," where the melody is recognizable, but the trio performs it in such a way as to let it breathe, in an open-ended, soaring kind of jazz take.
 "We did that in one or two takes, and there's no real arrangement -- it's just how we felt," Robitaille explained. "I think it helps if you bring in some pop, or standards. It helps if you can introduce music fans to a tune that might be more universally known or sound familiar to more people. You're widening the scope of the jazz repertoire for your audience. If they like that, they might start to think about your other tunes that they might not know. We almost want to obliterate the idea of genres, and appreciate it as just music. And especially on an album, you want to have your own originals dovetail with stuff like that, so it all flows."
 Robitaille's different voicings on guitar are more incredible when you remember he doesn't use much in the way of effects, or added electronics, yet he can sound like keyboards or horns, and always has impeccable touch.
 "I'm probably in the middle there," he said, laughing. "I know some players just go straight into an amplifier. I do use reverb, and an in-and-out modulation delay -- kind of like a sustain effect. And I usually use an overdrive -- I think early Charlie Christian or Wes Montgomery always have that when they're digging in. But I look at it like a saxophone reed. I use it to get a more reedy sound, not really distortion, but more for sustain. My sound is constantly evolving, because I think your sound is most important; your listeners' response and emotions are all triggered by that sound."
 Robitaille said he is hoping to take part in some streaming online shows soon, and one of the venues that's been discussed is Weymouth's Article 15 brewery.
