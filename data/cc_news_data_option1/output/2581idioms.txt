For 21 years, Lewis spent his life behind bars, incarcerated for a murder he didn’t commit. But last year, at age 40, he finally walked out of a Chester County prison after a judge ruled that he had been denied due process during his original trial.

“I’m from New York and he’s from Massachusetts,” she continued. “We love our breakfast, and there’s no good breakfast joint around here.”
 When the couple purchased the county Route 23 property nearly three years prior, its deed designated it for residential-agricultural use, Andy said. They were granted a special-use permit, but were issued a cease-and-desist notice just eight months later when code enforcement officials realized the property was zoned exclusively for residential use.
 “We bought it on the assumption a business could go there,” Andy said.
 Many setbacks later, plans are still in the works to open the cafe, Niki said, but the process has been “extremely frustrating.”
 Brown said that the deeds for many properties throughout the town could be 100 years old or more.
 “The town’s zoning map is dated. It doesn’t even show Interstate 88,” he said, adding that Sidney Center’s zoning has not been updated since 1989.
 Addressing suspicions that the proposed zoning changes were motivated by the town’s desire to develop three empty residential lots it owns along county Route 23, Sidney Town Supervisor Gene Pigford said that the proposal had been “a long time in the making.”
 “Sidney Center residents have wanted to facilitate appropriate commercial development in the area,” he said. “We want to look at development without it being at the expense of the ambiance that has made this community the wonderful place it is to be.”
 He promised to more actively engage residents of the hamlet in a continuing dialogue concerning its future, starting with Zoom meetings as early as next week.
 “We care about this community and we want what’s best. We want to understand what you need, what will work for you and to work toward it,” Pigford said. “It has to be the right time with the right kind of controls. I’d like to see the right kind of small business in this community.”

Most mercury pollution comes from small-scale gold refining and coal burning. It rises into the atmosphere, circulates globally and then falls again in rain and snow. When mercury reaches low-oxygen environments, such as wetlands and lake beds, bacteria convert it to a toxic form called methylmercury that can accumulate in plants and animals. In humans, exposure results in the highest risk to fetuses and young children, who can experience developmental problems.

  Depay, 26, moved to Lyon from Manchester United and has found success with the French club.


  His form in Ligue 1 has caught the eye of Mikel Arteta, with the Arsenal boss believing Depay could be an adequate replacement for Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang or Alexandre Lacazette, should either leave the Emirates this summer.


  The report claims that Arteta is not only impressed with Depay’s technical ability but also his character.


  Depay had a difficult time at Manchester United before moving to Lyon, with his struggles at Old Trafford difficult for former boss Jose Mourinho to explain.

PROVINCETOWN -- Robert Anthony and Louise Venden were re-elected to the Select Board at Tuesday's annual town election, which was postponed this year due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Anthony and Venden beat challenger Austin Knight with 646 and 548 votes, respectively. Knight received 330 votes. There were 234 blank votes. The two Select Board seats are each for three-year terms.
 Out of the 3,001 registered voters in town, there were 888 ballots cast in Tuesday's election, according to the unofficial results emailed to the Banner after midnight on Wednesday.
 Additionally, voters approved spending $325,000 to pay for a replacement ambulance. More than 600 voters approved the question but the measure will have to pass at a future town meeting as well. The average estimated property tax impact of the new ambulance is $18.56 in the first year if the measure passes with a two-thirds majority vote at the town meeting.
 Voters did not approve spending an additional $64,500 in real estate and personal property taxes to increase the Select Board members' stipend. The question came from a petitioned article. For the article, there were 293 votes in favor and 563 against.
 Currently, the total annual Select Board stipend is $10,500, with the chair receiving $2,500 and other board members getting $2,000.
 Voters also approved a question placed on the ballot by an activist group that has opposed the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. The Plymouth site was permanently shut down in May, 2019. The group asked voters in each of the towns in the county to direct Gov. Charlie Baker and state legislators to require that the radioactive waste be stored in "better quality" dry casks than those planned for use. Additionally, the group asked that the casks be protected by earthen berms or within enclosures with heightened security.

And a chubby 6-year-old boy named Richard Woodruff, a huge fan of the new burger, walked into the place one day, and Wian greeted him with, “Hello, big boy.” Inspiration struck, and thus was born the name of the new hamburger.
 The rest, as they say, was history.
 Bob’s Pantry became Bob’s Big Boy, and its signature dish became the basis of a franchise with scores of restaurants across the country under different names – Shoney’s, Frisch’s, Azar’s. A plaster statue of the chubby little boy, tray with double-decker held joyfully aloft, has graced the entrance to every one.
 Including the Azar’s on Bluffton Road, serving up comfort food since 1964 and one of my indelible memories of Fort Wayne. Whenever I flew back to Fort Wayne, seeing Big Boy on the way from the airport let me know I was back home.
 Come to think of it, that location meant every visitor who flew to Fort Wayne and went downtown could take a special memory of the statue away with them. New York might have had its Statue of Liberty, San Francisco its Golden Gate Bridge, Paris its Eiffel Tower, but Fort Wayne had its goofy icon of greasy, gastronomic delight.
 Until, alas, last week.
 The statue had disappeared periodically for short times – those high school pranks, you know – but this time it left for good. It was taken down and put into a waiting truck and hauled away.
 In early April, all restaurants had to close because of the COVID-19 virus. Azar’s was one of the ones that didn’t make it back. Owner George Azar said in an interview something about “the ongoing impact on public psychology.” Some 30 percent of the restaurant’s sales were from breakfast and salad bars, which we are not likely to see again in this lifetime.

Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar on Wednesday played down reports about confusion regarding valuation of Second Pre- University and the Secondary School Leaving Certificate exam papers.
 "Creating confusion has become a habit. There was confusion before the exam, during the exam and now confusion about the valuation of the exam papers," Kumar told reporters in Ramanagara when asked about the confusion over the valuation of answer sheets.
 He had gone there to inspect a few centres where the SSLC or the 10th standard exams are underway.
 The minister reminded people not to speak about the abilities of the students with contempt.
 "Our students have toiled hard and are enthusiastically appearing for the examination. They are eligible for the marks they will score. So we should not speak about our children with disrespect," Kumar said.
 The Education Minister said he had spoken to many leaders including former chief ministers Siddaramaiah and H D Kumaraswamy on conducting the examinations.
 "Kumaraswamy had insisted on postponing the examination. I personally spoke to him and apprised him about the steps taken by us. I told him that we will work with more sincerity to ensure the safety of the children," Kumar said.
 The SSLC exam was scheduled to take place from March 27 but due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown it was postponed.
 While the CBSE and a few other states either decided to give marks based on the students' performance in the previous examinations such as quarterly and half-yearly exams, or gave general promotion to the students, Karnataka went ahead to hold the exam.
 According to Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board officials, around 8.5 lakh students have enrolled this year for the SSLC examination.
 The exams are being held at 2,879 exam centres across the state.
 Prior to the SSLC examination, the last exam of the Second PUC was also conducted on June 18, which was also put on hold due to the lockdown.

 Families with children at home were also more likely than the average population to say they will try to use less petrol. Nearly a fifth (18%) of households generally will make an effort to use less petrol, rising to 22% among families with children at home.
 The research found families with children at home were more likely to have dipped into their savings and taken on more debt during the Covid-19 lockdown. Some 28% have dipped into savings, compared with 23% of households with no children at home.

Where did the Big Boy go? That’s what people are asking on our neighborhood social media app. Speculation ranges from “into a warehouse” to “on Craig’s List” and “at another restaurant somewhere.”
 I had my own notion for a time.
 I hoped the city of Fort Wayne had acquired the icon and was holding it in a secure location somewhere, ready for emergency stand-in statue duty.
 I think we all know that the days are numbered for the statue of Mad Anthony Wayne in downtown Fort Wayne. There have been plenty of complaints over the years about honoring someone who was, by today’s progressive standards, on the wrong side of history in the country’s war with indigenous populations.
 Today, with the campaign against statues having moved from Confederate generals to include any imperfect person from the tainted past – that is to say, everyone – the time is right for those complaints to finally bear fruit.
 But they can’t just leave a hole where the statue used to be. And what better replacement memorial for a bloodthirsty military thug than an innocent little boy, holding food up to the sky on a tray, as if to thank the universe for our sustenance. Surely, no one would find controversy there?
 But I soon realized that my idea was badly flawed.
 I did a little more research and discovered that Richard Woodruff, the inspiration for Big Boy, died in 1986 at the age of 54, from the effects “of a long illness.” His obit didn’t say what the illness was, but he weighed 300 pounds at the time, so we can probably guess. He would likely be objected to as a bad role model not only for judgmental vegetarians but picky health- conscious eaters as well.
 So, scratch that, one more indigestible item on our modern menu of unpalatable ideas.
 I just had a sudden vision of Mad Anthony and Big Boy together in the park. Mad is astride his prancing horse, sword held to his side, ready to be wielded. Big is holding the hamburger tray up to him, as if imploring. Will the general cleave the burger, so that it might be shared? Or will he smite the chubby boy as a troublesome indigenous icon?
 The perfect question for our frazzled times because, frankly, it could go either way.

Mt. Pleasant soon will part ways with its very first director of parks and recreation.
   
 Thomas Kenney will leave his post for another position after four years of establishing and expanding the local program as its first full-time director, the city announced this week.
   
 Mt. Pleasant Commissioner Bedford Smith will step down from his role on the city board to take a position as the city's director of parks and recreation.
   
 Smith formally leave his post in public office July 13 in preparation of Kenney's departure who will serve his final day as the director of the local parks and recreation program on July 24.
   
 The commission likely will appoint a commissioner to temporary fill the role until a candidate is selected during the November election. That candidate will then complete the remaining two years of Bedford's four-year term.
   
 Three additional seats on the city's five-person board will also be up for election in November.
   
 City Manager Kate Collier said the Smith was offered the position after a competitive application process.
   
 Smith was appointed to the local board in late 2018.
   
 At the same time, commissioners Bill White and Delores Blankenship were named the new mayor and vice mayor of the city, launching a new era of leadership for the community of about 6,000 southwest of Columbia.
   
 Kenney departs the role to take on a new position as the manager of a recreation program on a U.S. military base in Puerto Rico.
   
 He was named the city's first director of parks and recreation in July of 2016 and expanded the department providing a period of growth and expansion to the community.
   
 The son of a father in the U.S. Army, Kenney grew up across the United States and spent a large portion of his youth in Germany.
   
 Kenney said he left a position in the corporate world to help build the city's new parks department and to spend more time with his wife Sharon and three sons, who are enrolled in Mt. Pleasant's public schools.
   
 During his four years in the position, he expanded the park system's public offerings from establishing exercise classes to hosting an ongoing series of teen nights and community gatherings at the city's community center.
   
 The launch of a spin program has been one of the director's most popular accomplishments.
   
 In 2018, Kenney secured a $31,150 grant to launch a spin class with the city's parks and recreation department and was funded by the Maury Regional Health Care Foundation.
   
 A spin class is a high intensity workout using a stationary bicycle in which an instructor leads a group of participants by guiding the riders through varying intervals of intensity.
   
 With the funding secured Kenney purchased 18 bikes, an audio visual system and marketing materials for the program that continues to offer classes to the public at the Mt. Pleasant Community Center.
   
 The studio is also equipped with a 60-inch flat screen television, lights and a sound system fit for a crowded house party.
   
 "We want to reach out to the community, all of Maury County, to get some exercise and live a healthy lifestyle," Kenney previously told The Daily Herald. "We are trying to offer something that is different, something that is fun. Spinning will wear you out. It is a great workout."
   
 The program continues with volunteers, including Kenney himself, leading the classes that are held on a daily basis and free to the public.
   
 The outgoing director also took a leading role in establishing the city's ongoing community concert series.
   
 The Mt. Pleasant Music Concert Series was first launched in the summer of 2017, promising to bring a major addition to the city's growing arts scene and first organized by Mt. Pleasant Parks Director Thomas Kenney, former TJ Smawls owner Jim Tjofalt and experienced music industry veteran and local business owner Michelle Morgan.
   
 Last year, the series returned to the city's downtown square after a brief hiatus.
   
 Kenney also took a leading role in the revival of the Thunder Over Maury car show and aviation event held just outside of the city at the Maury County Airport.
   
 "This is a beautiful airport, and we want to show people that we have a great airport right here in Maury County," said Kenney, as he served as the event's head coordinator last year.
   
 With its 6,000-foot lighted runway, seven enclosed hangars and an AWOS weather station, the regional airport attracts a variety of users, from the flight enthusiast to corporate, military and medical transports.
   
 Like many events across the state this year's show, originally scheduled for May 16, has been postponed in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 "I'm a people person," Kenney previously said during an interview in his office at the city's community center at 501 Gray Lane. "I am about going out there and finding what is going to be fun. We are trying to bring a change in culture."

 The phone has been buzzing and ringing off the hook since he accepted the position, from congrats to division one college coaches reaching out to start a connection with the head coach.
 ​
 Stepping back to step forward as the new Easton coach put it, saying his 26 years at Liberty prepared him for this moment. Karam is also eager to work with coach Jordan Kutler and the newly formed girls wrestling team.

Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar on Wednesday played down reports about confusion regarding valuation of Second Pre- University and the Secondary School Leaving Certificate exam papers.
 "Creating confusion has become a habit. There was confusion before the exam, during the exam and now confusion about the valuation of the exam papers," Kumar told reporters in Ramanagara when asked about the confusion over the valuation of answer sheets.
 He had gone there to inspect a few centres where the SSLC or the 10th standard exams are underway.
 The minister reminded people not to speak about the abilities of the students with contempt.
   
   
 "Our students have toiled hard and are enthusiastically appearing for the examination. They are eligible for the marks they will score. So we should not speak about our children with disrespect," Kumar said.
 The Education Minister said he had spoken to many leaders including former chief ministers Siddaramaiah and H D Kumaraswamy on conducting the examinations.
 "Kumaraswamy had insisted on postponing the examination. I personally spoke to him and apprised him about the steps taken by us. I told him that we will work with more sincerity to ensure the safety of the children," Kumar said.
 The SSLC exam was scheduled to take place from March 27 but due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown it was postponed.
 While the CBSE and a few other states either decided to give marks based on the students' performance in the previous examinations such as quarterly and half-yearly exams, or gave general promotion to the students, Karnataka went ahead to hold the exam.
 According to Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board officials, around 8.5 lakh students have enrolled this year for the SSLC examination.
 The exams are being held at 2,879 exam centres across the state.
 Prior to the SSLC examination, the last exam of the Second PUC was also conducted on June 18, which was also put on hold due to the lockdown.

He and co-workers found that yellow perch that hunted at night contained more mercury than yellow perch that fed during the day. Mercury concentrations also varied among the species of zooplankton, tiny invertebrates that drift around the lake. But the researchers couldn’t fit these puzzle pieces together until years later, when University of Regina postdoc Richard Vogt looked closely at one of the zooplankton, called _Leptodora_.

I thought, as I ran over this stretch of tragedy-soaked American soil, that we Americans so often strip our national story of its pain and arduousness. We view it as a march of triumph. We see the American Revolution as an accomplished fact, rather than an ongoing, even unending challenge.
 The truth is that our history is a hard scramble up a steep hill. Over and over, we think we’ve reached the top, only to find that we’ve been stopped or even sent tumbling back, as we argue, even fight, again and again and again, over the meaning of the freedom that defines us as a nation.
 We’re locked now in another debate about how we should remember the people who killed those three Hoosier boys so long ago.
 As valiant warriors?
 As traitors?
 It’s appropriate, even altogether fitting, that we have that discussion – because it is the one essential American conversation. If we cannot come to terms with our past, we cannot do right by the present.
 The founders of this nation were far-from-perfect exemplars of the principles they set forth, but they did establish the terms by which they themselves – and we – could be indicted. America, they said, was to be judged by how far and how completely we Americans extend the blessings of liberty.
 In other words, our task, as Americans, is to keep scrambling up that steep hill.
 No matter how many times we get stopped.
 No matter how many times we get knocked down.
 There’s a reason my thoughts these days have drifted back to that long-ago run when the spirits of those long-dead Hoosier boys strode with me.
 That run took place on a special day.
 It was the anniversary of the day Vicksburg fell and made the Union’s victory all but inevitable.
 It was the Fourth of July.

The House and Senate passed the resolution on June 9, stating that Wolf abused his emergency powers by failing to consult lawmakers on business shutdowns. More than 20 Democrats voted to approve the measure.
 “We express no opinion as to whether the Governor’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes wise or sound policy. Similarly, we do not opine as to whether the General Assembly, in seeking to limit or terminate the Governor’s exercise of emergency authority, presents a superior approach,” Wecht wrote.
 Earlier Wednesday Wolf expanded his mask-wearing order to include anytime anyone leaves home. The original order signed in April only required mask- wearing in businesses.
 “This mask-wearing order is essential to stopping the recent increase in COVID-19 cases we have seen in Pennsylvania,” he said in a press release. “Those hotspots can be traced to situations where Pennsylvanians were not wearing masks or practicing social distancing — two practices that must be adhered to if we want to maintain the freedoms we have in place under our reopening.”

And if enough players break enough rules, the league could have a big problem on its hands, and fast.

“We were doing workouts by time, you know? You have to reserve a time. I wasn’t interacting with a lot of people there,” Moncada said of his sessions in Florida. “The last couple of weeks I started lifting a little bit. I was hitting with limitations that we had during this situation. But I feel good. I’m ready to go.”
 Much like other clubs, the White Sox intend to split their 60-man roster into two groups, one working out in the morning and the other in the afternoon. All players will have their temperatures checked multiple times each day, observe increased social distancing and get accustomed to stringent safeguards that MLB has put into place for the season.
 “That’s going to be different to see and feel as a team,” Moncada said. “We’ll have to wait and see Friday how it goes.”
 The Yankees won’t hold their first full-team workout until Saturday, even though manager Aaron Boone said players began intake testing Wednesday. That’s when he plans to address the team for the first time — also in waves.
 “We’ll have to get creative with how we communicate,” said Boone, who plans to make the same speech three or four times.
 Faced with the prospect of playing 60 games in 66 days, time-consuming safety protocols, the responsibility to remain diligent health-wise off the field and the general anxiety of working amid a pandemic, Boone believes focus and toughness can be as important to a team this season as baserunning or bullpen management.

 PROVINCETOWN -- Robert Anthony and Louise Venden were re-elected to the Select Board at Tuesday's annual town election, which was postponed this year due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Anthony and Venden beat challenger Austin Knight with 646 and 548 votes, respectively. Knight received 330 votes. There were 234 blank votes. The two Select Board seats are each for three-year terms.
 Out of the 3,001 registered voters in town, there were 888 ballots cast in Tuesday's election, according to the unofficial results emailed to the Banner after midnight on Wednesday.
 Additionally, voters approved spending $325,000 to pay for a replacement ambulance. More than 600 voters approved the question but the measure will have to pass at a future town meeting as well. The average estimated property tax impact of the new ambulance is $18.56 in the first year if the measure passes with a two-thirds majority vote at the town meeting.
 Voters did not approve spending an additional $64,500 in real estate and personal property taxes to increase the Select Board members' stipend. The question came from a petitioned article. For the article, there were 293 votes in favor and 563 against.
 Currently, the total annual Select Board stipend is $10,500, with the chair receiving $2,500 and other board members getting $2,000.
 Voters also approved a question placed on the ballot by an activist group that has opposed the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. The Plymouth site was permanently shut down in May, 2019. The group asked voters in each of the towns in the county to direct Gov. Charlie Baker and state legislators to require that the radioactive waste be stored in \"better quality\" dry casks than those planned for use. Additionally, the group asked that the casks be protected by earthen berms or within enclosures with heightened security.

Edge saw his comeback tour with the WWE hit a serious roadblock back at _Backlash_ when, while taping the "Greatest Match Ever" with Randy Orton, he suffered a torn tricep. Little was known about when the injury actually occurred during the match, though the bruising on Edge's injured arm had already started to form by the time Orton delivered a Punt Kick and picked up the win. During an interview on The Hall of Fame Podcast with Booker T on Wednesday night, the "Rated-R Superstar" explained what happened.


  "I did a springboard into the second RKO. I went 'ooh.' I got the cold sweats and I feel like I'm going to throw up. That's usually a sign, that's where it popped," Edge said.


  "I thought, okay, I think I have a little bit more in the tank to finish this out," he added.


  One night after the match aired, WWE confirmed the injury and stated Edge had already undergone successful surgery. Edge discovered after the fact that his tricep was already partially torn walking into the match.


  "By the time I got the surgery, the surgeon said 'you probably went in with it partially torn because the tissue was already very diseased.' And my elbow had been bugging me for probably about a month," he explained. "But it would only bug me when I did chest or triceps (workouts). Here's what I learned going forward -- I need to listen to those signs."


  He then said the injury actually worked out well.


  "I am happy, going in with it partially torn, that I made it 45 minutes through the match before it finally went so that I was able to finish it out. Because if that had started two minutes in, it would've been hard to finish the match.

  The 11-time world champion then talked about his goals for the rest of his run.


  "I want to finish it on my terms. I'm really stubborn on that in this run, I guess. I really want to, with this, try and show that selling still sells," he said. "I feel like that's been lost. Don't get me wrong, I'm guilty, too. You can watch the TLC matches and say 'but, but, but!' And I get it. I was young and I was there and I did it. I was always told by the Steve Austin's, by the (Undertakers) of the world, 'hey man, if you just slowed down and tried this and that, and this and that.' When I started doing that, that's when I started making real money. I see stuff and I'm like, man, everybody is so athletic, so gifted, doing stuff that I couldn't even fathom. I just want to try and show that if you did a quarter of that with all of those little things in between, now you're painting masterpieces that will be able to be around for a while because you'll have longevity this way."

North Carolina families will have to wait a little longer to find out what school is going to look like next school year.
   
 Gov. Roy Cooper had originally set Wednesday as the deadline to inform school districts which of three reopening plans were permissible when K-12 lessons resume Aug. 17.
   
 But Tuesday night Cooper announced that he would not address reopening plans for the 2020-21 school year Wednesday.
   
 "Let me be clear. We want our schools open for in-person instruction in August," the governor said during a Wednesday afternoon press conference, noting that parents, students, teachers and school staff are anxious for some clarity.
   
 Cooper said he should have a decision "within the next couple weeks."
   
 "We want to make sure we get this right," he said, noting that getting students safely back into the classroom remains his administration's No. 1 priority.
   
 Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, the Republican candidate for governor, criticized the Democratic governor's decision.
   
 "School starts in just six weeks," Forest said Wednesday. "Schools need certainty, but more importantly, families need certainty. This is not the leadership North Carolina needs."
   
 Forest and other state Republican leaders have attacked Cooper's reopening plans, which include options for districts to conduct in-person instruction in shifts or to completely forgo traditional physical lessons and exclusively teach remotely.
   
 "Our schools should be full of students, not fear," Forest said in a June 11 statement.
   
 On Wednesday, the state's largest educator advocacy group came out in favor of Cooper's decision to postpone releasing reopening guidelines.
   
 "COVID information is changing on a daily basis, and the health and safety of all of our state's educators, students, and their families is at stake," said Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the N.C. Association of Educators. "It is far more important to get this decision right than to get it done quickly."
   
 Three possible plans
   
 Earlier this month, state health and education officials released reopening guidelines which mandated school districts develop three plans, varied in degrees of restrictiveness. Plan A calls for all students to attend school at the same time. Plan B limits schools to 50% of their maximum capacity, as students may alternate attending schools for portions of the day, week, or month. Plan C is exclusively remote learning, a system many families have grown accustomed to since mid-March, when school buildings first closed amid COVID-19 safety concerns.
   
 The guidelines will be a baseline; any of North Carolina's 115 school districts and charter schools may choose a more restrictive plan though none may chose a more lenient option.
   
 Most district leaders are awaiting Cooper's decision before sharing reopening specifics.
   
 "I think we are too far away from the opening of schools to make a decision that will stick when the data seems to change every three weeks or so," said Bill Nolte, superintendent of Haywood County Schools. "So, it was not a surprise to me that he's delayed the decision."
   
 Cooper's delay comes as North Carolina has seen a recent spike in COVID-19 cases, reporting 66,513 cases as of noon Wednesday -- an increase of 1,843, the highest one-day jump to date.
   
 An Elon University Poll of 1,410 North Carolina residents conducted June 24-25 found a fairly even divide among the three reopening options, with 34% of respondents supporting a full return to in-person instruction, 38% supporting a partial return to in-person lessons, and 29% backing a fully remote start to the school year.

PARAMEDICS are asking parents to ensure their children wear adequate safety protection and are well supervised, after a nine-year-old boy broke his arm at Boyne Island skate park this morning.


  A Queensland Ambulance Service spokeswoman said paramedics attended the skate park just after 9am and treated the young boy for his injuries.


  “He was taken to Gladstone Hospital by ambulance in a stable condition,” the spokeswoman said.


  Gladstone Ambulance Station Officer in Charge, Leia Spencer said now health restrictions had been lifted, many families would be out and about, which could result in a spike in injury numbers.


  “To minimise any chance of children injuring themselves on scooters, bikes or skateboards we want to ensure they have properly fitted helmets that are always worn,” she said.


  “Children should be warned to always stay away from the roads and wear additional safety gear if they have it.


  “We are going to see more children and families getting out and using our footpaths and skate parks, especially during the school holidays.


  “We can expect, that with them out and about, that accidents are going to start occurring.


  “Parents should keep a watchful eye on their kids, as a moment of inattention is all it takes for an accident to happen.”


  During school holidays, unfortunately paramedics attend a wide range of incidents involving children, from minor to life threatening.


  “It could be as small as falling off and scraping a knee, to serious incidents with cars and bikes being involved,” she said.


  “During school holidays and on weekends, now that skate parks are open, they will be definitely places we go to, but accidents can happen anywhere and everywhere.”


  For families travelling this holidays, please be vigilant to ensure you get home safely.


  “Be careful with speeding, intoxication, make sure your wear your seatbelts, be aware of driver fatigue and distractions,” Station Officer Spencer said.


  “Be mindful of others on the road and pedestrians, so everyone gets home after the holidays safe and well.”

Passengers should keep possession of their boarding passes. Instead of handing their boarding pass to a TSA officer at the travel document podium, travelers should place their boarding pass (paper or electronic) on the boarding pass reader themselves. After scanning, travelers should hold their boarding pass toward the TSA officer to allow the officer to visually inspect it. This change reduces the TSA officer’s need to touch a passenger’s boarding pass, thus reducing potential for cross-contamination.
 Travelers should separate food for X-ray screening. Passengers should place their carry-on food items into a bin. Food items often trigger an alarm during the screening process; separating the food from the carry-on bag lessens the likelihood that a TSA officer will need to open the carry-on bag and remove the food for a closer inspection. It is recommended to pack the food in a clear plastic bag and place the clear bag of food into the bin. This requirement reduces the TSA officer’s need to touch a person’s carry-on bag and container of food and reduces potential for cross-contamination. TSA PreCheck™ members do not need to remove items from their bags.
 Passengers may bring one liquid hand sanitizer container, up to 12 ounces per passenger, in carry-on bags. Passengers are required to remove the large hand sanitizer from their carry-on bag and place it in a bin for additional screening. Passengers should expect that the screening of a large container of hand sanitizer is likely to take some extra time. Other liquids, gels and aerosols in a carry-on bag continue to be limited to a maximum of 3.4 ounces per item and all of those items must fit into a one clear quart-size bag.
 If a carry-on bag is found to contain a prohibited item, passengers may be directed to return to the divestiture table outside of security with their carry-on bags to remove the item and dispose of the item. The passenger may also be directed back outside of security to remove, items that should have originally been divested (such as laptops, liquids, gels, and aerosols, and large electronics) and resubmit their property for X-ray screening. By resolving alarms in this manner, TSA officers will not need to touch the contents inside a carry-on bag as frequently, reducing the potential for cross-contamination.
 Beyond TSA checkpoint area changes, many airlines and airports are providing specific COVID-19 and summer travel season related guidance. Travelers should check with their airline prior to their trip to determine if the airline has made any changes to procedures.
 As passenger volumes continue to rise, TSA recommends that travelers arrive to the airport early since new procedures, such as social distancing, may add time to the pre-flight experience. This practice ensures adequate time for checking bags, completing security screening and getting to the departure gate on time.

Nearby officers heard the shots and took cover, according to court documents.
 Dorsey said she was not given any evidence to review prior to the hearing, but that based on the criminal complaint alone, the allegation of assault on peace officers is unfounded because officers retreated when they heard a firearm and were not in immediate fear of harm.
 One of the negligent use of a deadly weapon charges is based on Elliott's impairment on alcohol or drugs, according to court documents. Dorsey said Elliott was arrested during a "high risk" traffic stop, but he was not subjected to a sobriety check. No charges of driving of driving under the influence were filed.
 A spokesman for the District Attorney's Office did not return an email Wednesday seeking comment on the case.
 In addition to the standard conditions of release, Marlowe also required Elliott to undergo a mental health screening and verify with the court that he is not in possession of any firearms.
 "I think that at this early stage in the investigatory process, it is important that the public remember that we have a constitutional presumption of innocence for a reason and a person like Mr. Elliott who has been a well respected member of out community for more than 20 years deserves to have that presumption apply for him specifically just as much as anyone else does," Dorsey said.

Holding an event at the fairgrounds requires the submission of plans to, and approval of, the South Heartland District Health Department.
 A plan also must be submitted to the fairgrounds office, letting Laux know whether there’s anything she needs to work on with the event so it will succeed.
 Kool-Aid Days representatives were in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting and said they are still planning to hold their event.
 A motion was made during Tuesday’s meeting not to hold the rodeo this year, which failed 3-5.
 Board member and Oregon Trail Rodeo chairman Scott Hinrichs said it’s especially important this year to hold the rodeo.
 “It’s just good family entertainment, especially this year when we’ve been shut down,” he said. “If there’s any feasible way of making it work we need to try. We’re just going to have to hit the streets and find out if the sponsors are still on board or not, instead of making a decision without talking to them.
 “It’s all sponsorship driven, the rodeos. We don’t use any taxpayer money for the rodeos. We can’t.”
 Phase 3 of reopening, which began June 22, allows for 75% of capacity for outdoor activities, which would make holding the rodeo feasible.
 “Safety’s first,” Hinrichs said. “That’s our number one priority. We’ll follow the guidelines to a tee with everything they tell us. Even at 75% capacity. We think it’s feasible if we can get sponsor money up there.”
 He said Tuesday he is negotiation with a TV network that might pay to broadcast the rodeo.
 “There are things up in the air that are huge,” he said.
