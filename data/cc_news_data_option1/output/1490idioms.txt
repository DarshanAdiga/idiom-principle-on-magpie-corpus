 Niantic - Samuel Peretz ,80, formerly of Niantic passed away in Plymouth, Mass. April 7, 2020, after a brief illness. Sam graduated New Britain High School in 1958 and Central Connecticut State University shortly after before embarking in a municipal career with the city of Annapolis, Md. followed by moving to the Town of East Lyme. As the East Lyme Parks and Recreation Director for 33 years, Sam's vision and passion paved the way for the creation of Bridebrook Park, vast improvements to the town beaches and numerous athletic fields. In 2013 he was inducted into the East Lyme Sports Hall of Fame for all of his efforts in providing activities, programs and facilities for town residents to enjoy. Sam's face and compassionate personality were known unanimously throughout town, always garnished with a bucket hat, cigar, and maybe some Dunkin Donuts' munchkins. As a testament to his character and dedication to the town, Bridebrook park was renamed as Samuel M. Peretz Park in 2004. Sam married his childhood sweetheart, Donna Peterson in March 1959. They celebrated 51 years together before her passing in 2010. He is survived by their four children and spouses, Robin and Paul Neff, Karen and Michael Rak, Kim and David Mok, and Todd and Denise Peretz. Also surviving are nine grandchildren, Shauna Nocery, Kathleen Collins, Naomi Zrenda, Maija Shank, Hadlai Neff, Kaz Rak, Caleb Rak, Chandler Mok, and Tyler Peretz; as well as seven great-grandchildren. Many nieces and nephews, in- laws, and countless friends will also remember Sam fondly. In light of all the news today and all of the uncertainties in the world, it's people like Samuel Peretz who have established a foundation of community for us all to fall back on. Sam not only created a world of sports and outdoor recreation for the children of East Lyme, but also gave the first job to many, a career break for some, and life-changing compassion to all. Sam, we hope to make you proud. A celebration of life will be held at a later date.

West Brom earned a hard-fought point with a goalless stalemate against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Saturday, with his team defending stoically under pressure from the hosts.
 And Pulis, who has never been relegated as a manager, stressed the importance of maintaining their momentum – West Brom have lost just once since his arrival at The Hawthorns – as the season enters its final third.
 "I've been involved in relegation fights a few times and you can never take your foot off the pedal," said the Welshman.
 "It's going to be nip and tuck until the end of the season.
 "We've got 12 games to go and we have to glean as many points as we can - we're in the scrap with eight or nine other teams, and everybody is fighting for their lives."
 Sunderland dominated proceedings throughout, with the visitors having to settle for sporadic counter-attacks.
 However, the hosts were ultimately unable to beat Ben Foster, though Adam Johnson did have a goal erroneously disallowed late in the first half.
 "We've played really well recently and we started well today but fell away, but the great thing is even though we didn't play well, we got something from the game," added Pulis, delighted with his team's resilience.
 "We went off the boil and it was all Sunderland, but we defended resolutely, and that's important for a team in our position.
 "If we don't play well in possession, then we have to put every effort into stopping the other team scoring, and we did."

ATLANTA — Even during a pandemic when we’re under government orders to not tempt fate and venture out, when we’re being told to stay at home and avoid an indiscriminate virus, in the midst of it all, we still have to buy groceries.
 For some of us that means going to a big-box store, where brave but worried stock people try to keep produce and meat bins filled; where cashiers, barely 6 feet away from customers, try to keep checkout lines running smoothly. Some of us might have groceries delivered, but leave the bags outside for a while, just in case the delivery person coughed as they set them on our doorsteps.
 Then there are people like Tina Fernandez, 47, who still want to pick out lettuce and eggs on their own, but for whom the idea of a trip to a big-box grocery store fills them with dread.

“People are still at the beach building camp fires, and to put them out, they cover them with sand and we’ve had in the outpatient clinic, they’ve seen two or three patients that came walking along and stepped in the sand and their feet went into the hot coals and got some really nasty burns,” Ryun said.
 Ryun said now is as important as ever to practice fire safety to prevent burn injuries. He has some tips, like to wear gloves while cleaning.
 “We’ve had at least one person who got chemical burns on their hands from cleaning countertops,” he said.
 If there’s a grease fire, he said don’t try to run out of the house with it or try to extinguish the fire.
 “The best thing to do is just put a lid on in, over the top of it, turn the heat off and let it extinguish itself,” Ryun said.
 He also said to keep a close watch on children near stoves, don’t use gasoline to start a fire, and don’t overload electrical outlets.
 “I know that the unit has been full and seems like we send somebody out and we get somebody back in, so it has been a pretty steady flow in the unit,” Ryun said.
 A spokesperson for Portland Fire & Rescue said it’s a good time to practice fire safety while at home. He said it’s a good idea to keep a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, have an escape ladder if you have more than one floor, and make sure smoke alarms are working.

Alison Boyd, who manages Macmillan's information and support centre, has volunteered to work in the family liaison and support team, helping those who have been diagnosed with Covid-19. She is expected to spend four to six weeks at the temporary hospital, which has been set up at the ExCeL to cater for up to 4,000 patients at a time. "I want to apply the same skills I use daily to support people with cancer like treating people with compassion and warmth to now help patients affected by Covid-19," Alison said. "Families and patients will still need the same kind of understanding and care, perhaps even more so since some patients are not allowed to see their family or loved ones. So clear and kind communication will be hugely important. "As I can't currently see patients in the cancer information centre, I wanted to play my part as a nursing professional. "I don't know what to expect to be honest, I just want to offer the same skills and compassion." Alison, who qualified as a nurse from Kings College University London in 1996, has worked with patients with respiratory illnesses earlier in her career before specialising in oncology. She has been working at the cancer charity's information centre at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since 2018. A team of volunteers will be continuing to offer support to cancer patients while Alison takes on her temporary role at the Nightingale Hospital. She is due to have her first shift this week and has praised the colleagues she will be working alongside. "I do know that it will be a unique environment, and that every single person working at the Nightingale will be a skilled professional in their own right," she said. "I know it will be an exceptional team. Everyone wants to provide outstanding care in what will be a challenging time and colleagues from the NHS, military, St John Ambulance and the London Ambulance Service are pulling together, want to do their job to the best of their ability, and have the upmost respect for patients, each other and the work we are about to undertake."

SINGAPORE/TOKYO -- Oil edged higher on Thursday following sharp losses in the previous session on hopes that a big build-up in U.S. inventories may mean producers have little option but to deepen output cuts as the coronavirus pandemic ravages demand.
 With official data showing U.S. inventories surging the most on record, WTI fell on Wednesday to its lowest since February 2002, with Brent slumping more than 6%.
 Brent crude was up 36 cents, or 1.3%, at $28.05 a barrel by 0502 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was up 10 cents, or 0.5%, at $19.97.
 Concerns about crumbling demand kept a lid on gains with both contracts having traded over 2.5% higher earlier in the session.
 Energy Information Administration data also showed large U.S. refined fuels stock builds despite refiners operating at 69% of capacity nationwide, the lowest since September 2008.
 "The massive storage build, as counterintuitive as it sounds, did provide some price support as the build foreshadows that more wellhead closures are just around the corner, which effectively trims U.S. supply," said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp.
 The figures followed a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that forecast oil demand would fall by 29 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, to the lowest in 25 years, and just below 30% of global demand before the coronavirus outbreak.
 That number is well above production cuts in the pipeline. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers including Russia, a grouping known OPEC+, have agreed to reduce output by 9.7 million bpd, while hoped-for cuts of another 10 million bpd from other countries including the United States could lower production by 20 million bpd.
 Last week, the EIA said U.S. production is expected to slump by 470,000 bpd.
 "Given the scale of demand destruction this quarter, OPEC+ cuts will fall short of bringing the market to balance anytime soon, and this is reflected in the price weakness seen since the OPEC+ deal," said ING bank in a note on Thursday.
 Some countries have also committed to increasing purchases of oil for their strategic stockpiles, but there are physical limits to how much oil can be bought.
 The "use of strategic petroleum reserves in China, India, South Korea, and the U.S. could add about 200 million barrels of temporary storage, but this only buys a few months of wiggle room," said Innes.
 Further cuts to production will be required "to avoid another collapse in oil prices," he said. (Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick and Roslan Khasawneh; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Lincoln Feast)

The Uruguay international has come in for criticism in recent weeks, and has netted just twice in his past 10 Ligue 1 appearances.
 There have been recent reports of a spat between Blanc and the player, but the former France boss has come out in support of his forward.
 "We have to maintain our trust in him. I am sure he will score goals, even when it seems a little complicated," Blanc said.
 "I'm sure it's a guy who will score goals. He is in a difficult period. Let's help him. Also help the team.
 "We must also think about the team. We must allow this individual reflection for Edi and collectively for the team."
 PSG host Nantes in the last 16 of the Coupe de France on Wednesday, and Blanc hopes his squad can cope with a busy schedule as they maintain their search for success on four fronts.
 "It's not very difficult to have the motivation to win matches," he added. "If we do not, the players need to change profession. And the coach too. What is difficult is accumulation of matches.
 "The recovery is complicated. Even if we win, sometimes we do not have the means to do so. I think, as you said, PSG has a large squad, quality squad. For now, we played four competitions with happiness. We are still qualified in each.
 "We will try to stay in the race until the last moment. I hope the squad will go well, there will be no injuries. I hope we will not have too many suspensions.
 "Because if it is, in fact, there will be choices to do. For now, despite a busy February, a busy January, we try to play games to earn them. Whatever the team on the pitch."

You can visit the individual reviews for more details—particularly those for the Razer Blade 15 and the Dell XPS 15 (7590)—but the takeaway is that Dark mode could be the chocolate to OLED's peanut butter. Using it delivered a noticeable improvement to battery life in our tests. OLED really does use up more juice displaying white pixels, and even pumping up the brightness to the max in Dark mode has much less of an impact than it does with white screens. Using Dark mode and watching videos with a lot of black or dark scenes could add up to hours of additional battery life. (Hello, Game of Thrones reruns!) Generally, OLED is a power saver, and this aspect only adds to the potential savings.
