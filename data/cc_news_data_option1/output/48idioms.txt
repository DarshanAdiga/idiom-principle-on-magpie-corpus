The Iraq AUMF has been on the books since 2002, when it was enacted to empower the administration of George W. Bush to depose Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who is long gone. It is supplemented by an earlier AUMF, passed shortly after 9/11, which authorized the U.S. government to go after those responsible for the attacks of that day and any “associated forces.” But the version of al- Qaeda responsible for 9/11 is long gone, too, even if the name lives on. Also gone is the principal actor behind the attack, Osama bin Laden, killed by U.S. forces and buried at sea. Conversely, the Tehran-backed militias (Kata’ib Hezbollah et al.) causing havoc in Iraq today — and killing Americans in the process — did not exist in 2001 or 2002. And if either AUMF was meant to include the Iranian state, then that certainly was not made explicit in the relevant texts.

The Irish warmed up for the meeting with Scotland by drawing with England
 If O'Neill is reluctant to actually use the dreaded 'must-win' tag, there is a general acceptance here that that is an accurate description.
 "I think it is a game we have to win," RTE's football correspondent Tony O'Donoghue told me at the team's training ground on the outskirts of Malahide, to the north of the capital.
 "If we lose any more ground on Scotland, Poland had such a good start and we all expect Germany to finish at a canter and if home advantage is to mean anything, we really have to pick up the three points.
 "There's going to be more difficult games - the last time Germany were in Dublin they beat us 6-1 so we would expect them to come here and win.
 "So if we don't pick up the maximum against Scotland, I think we're out of contention."
 Scotland's victory over the Irish in November has changed the complexion of the group, certainly, but O'Neill is quick to underline his own team's credentials.
 "They [Scotland] are pretty confident within themselves," he said. "Scotland now have got a bit of momentum but I think we've only lost one in the last seven or eight games, so we've got a bit of momentum ourselves.
 Much of the focus from the local media is on the role of Robbie Keane in the team.

The cause of California’s biggest 2019 wildfire, the Kincade fire, is still officially under investigation. But PG&E has said a high-voltage transmission line that was not powered down during a late October blackout experienced problems near the origin of the blaze, which destroyed 374 structures.
 The Kincade fire erupted in the hills of Sonoma County at the beginning of an unusually long stretch of red flag days in the region, which at one point was buffeted by winds gusting to 90 to 100 mph. Statewide, October was the 10th driest on record.
 Were it not for the electricity outages, Wara argued, damaged power equipment could have sparked numerous other wind-blown blazes across Northern California at the same time as the Kincade fire. That would have overwhelmed firefighters in a replay of the 2017 wine country conflagrations.
 “The Kincade fire was successfully fought by Cal Fire in part because it was the only fire,” he said.
 Though downed power lines have caused many of the state’s wildfire disasters, human ignitions run the gamut.

He vowed to change that against North Branch, and that’s what he did.
 Holmes got into the flow of the game early, then he went on to score 29 points, including a resounding dunk, as Hibbing defeated the Vikings 76-48 Saturday at the Lincoln Elementary School Gymnasium.
 After an emotional win over the Tigers on Friday, how were the Bluejackets going to bounce back against the Vikings?
 “We came ready to play, and we came out with a good win,” Hibbing senior Isaac Colbaugh said.
 Holmes said it was a big win, too, but he knew his team had bounce back against North Branch, including getting his game back on track.
 There was one change Holmes had to make to perform better.
 “It was all about not forcing shots like I did Friday,” Holmes said. “I had to get into a rhythm. I had to let the game come to me. I was too ancey. I was all over the place. Today, I relaxed a little bit.
 “I didn’t force the shots that I had. I was getting my feet set.”
 Holmes scored 11 of Hibbing’s first 17 points, so he knew he was on his game right away.
 “The first couple of shots I took felt good,” Holmes said. “I started shooting more, and they started going in.”
 Hibbing would take a 46-20 lead into the half. That was all based on one thing — strong defensive play.
 “We had to limit their penetration and kicking it out to their shooters,” Colbaugh said. “We had to keep their shooters from getting going.”
 That’s the one thing the Vikings didn’t do against Holmes, who finished with 23 points in the first half.
 Holmes knew the Vikings’ coaching staff would some adjustments on him in the second half, so he adjusted his game as well.
 “I knew they were going to over commit, so I had to look for open people,” Holmes said. “There were open spots everywhere. They were overplaying.”
 The Bluejackets ball movement in the second half kept the Vikings off balance, and although North Branch tried to make a run, it never got any closer than 20 points the rest of the way.
 “We passed the ball well,” Colbaugh said. “We were finding open guys for layups and open threes. We kept going. We didn’t let them catch up at all. We put the hammer down.”

Many factors contribute to the ease by which we attack each other, but one could be social isolation, which can negatively affect our physical and emotional health. How we use social media and other technology plays a big role here. For example, instead of going out to the movies, or to work, or to shop, or even gather with friends, more of us stay home on our computers, Prime or Hulu or Xboxes or FB or texts or whatever. This makes it easier for us to experience loneliness, anger, and lose sight of the humanity of others. Face to face communication is so much more than words. It is the felt presence of a breathing being, and texts, written words, even images cannot replicate that.

And if we thought that the Borough Council’s difficulties with children and education were bad, the news that a private Academy Trust was citing the funding crisis as the reason for pulling out of running the troubled Northern House School - leaving pupils in limbo. Already branded “Inadequate” by Ofsted, the trust said that “The funding system, over which we as a Trust have no control, does not provide enough funding and it is not reliable. It just doesn’t work for a small Trust like ourselves whose schools are dedicated to pupils with special needs”. Taken with other quotes from the academy, it typifies all that’s wrong with the Academy system of education - which isn’t under Council control until it’s time for the Council to pick up the pieces when a ‘Trust’ can’t make enough money to deliver on their obligations.
