This final tip is an important one. I learned quickly that real estate can be a tough, demanding and mean business to work in. It’s not an easy career. It’s a highly competitive business, and competition can often create space for people to be mean and derogatory to each other.

 "So they contacted the rangers and began an investigation and we've been actively searching for the mother since that time. We have both aerial search going on and our dive team as well.
 "Indications are that we believe she did go in the lake. At this point it's still a search and that's what we know up to this point.

Tsingtao Brewery's flagship Tsingtao brand accounted for approximately half of the company's sales volume in FY2019, and Tsingtao is the second most popular brand of beer in China with a 8.7% market share, after China Resources Beer's Snow brand which has a 22.8% market share. Tsingtao Brewery's other notable brands include Laoshan, Hans and Shanshui, which have market shares of 2.9%, 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Anheuser-Busch InBev's flagship Budweiser brand is the best-selling brand in the premium segment with a 4.0% share of the overall Chinese beer market.
 ## Company Engineered A Turnaround Starting In 2018
 Tsingtao Brewery has been steadily growing its market share in China's beer market in the 2010-2014 period, which saw its market share increase from 13.8% in 2010 to 15.9% in 2012, before expanding further to 18.0% by 2014. In contrast, Tsingtao Brewery's market share stagnated in the 2015-2017 period, as its market share of the Chinese beer market declined from 18.0% in 2014 to 17.3% in 2017.
 Tsingtao Brewery witnessed negative revenue growth in both FY2015 and FY2016, prior to delivering a marginal +0.7% YoY top line growth in FY2017, in contrast with double-digit revenue growth historically. This was attributable to both a slowdown in the growth of the overall Chinese beer market and Tsingtao Brewery's market share loss as highlighted above.
 In addition, Tsingtao Brewery's profitability also declined in tandem with the company's slower pace of revenue of growth. Between FY2009 and FY2015, Tsingtao Brewery's net profit margins were consistently in the high-single- digit range. The company's net profit margins were in the 4%-5% mid-single- digit range in the FY2016-FY2017 period.
 Tsingtao Brewery has only been valued by the market at below 20 times consensus forward P/E twice in the past 15 years, and that happened during the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis and the 2015-2016 period when the company was experiencing market share loss and depressed profitability. The key reasons for Tsingtao Brewery's poor performance since 2015 were the company's failure to capitalize on the premiumization trend in the Chinese beer industry and its "1+N" (one main Tsingtao brand and a number of other supporting brands) product strategy which lacked focus.

It seems a simple idea, as pseudoscience often does. It's tempting and convenient. You just have to design a basket of consumer good. You just presume that these goods are a proper and representative measure of the things people buy. Nevermind that even the advocates of this approach do not agree on which goods should be included and which excluded.
 Also, you ignore when, say, horse-drawn buggies are replaced by cars and hence there is no more need for buggy whips. Plus don't mention improvements in the goods themselves. A 1980 car is not remotely comparable to a 2020 car. The 1980 car was before even that beacon of mediocrity known as the "K Car".
 Anyways, pay no need to this cognitive mess. And heed not your third grade math teacher, who said that you cannot add apples to oranges. Instead, be mesmerized by modern monetary magicians who insist that you absolutely can, if you're making an index which includes apples and oranges and fuel and cars.
 You just need to take a weighted average of the prices of the arbitrarily- chosen goods. Oh, by the way, you have to assume that consumer goods have constant real value. This is necessary to make the next Grand Canyon leap to the notion that consumer goods prices can be used to adjust the unit of measure of value itself.
 Oh. Sorry. We forgot one more assumption: that monetary debasement is a scalar; that is, there is only one dimension. One way that debasement affects the dollar. And therefore we need only look at one variable. Consumer prices.
 Don't worry, boys and girls, we are doing science!
 With those unwarranted assumptions and bogus inferences behind us, we have a consumer price index (CPI). We're ready for the part of the science experiment that is guaranteed to amaze the parents and younger siblings of any 8-year old with a science experiment kit. He dips a white strip of paper into a glass containing clear liquid, and… presto chango abracadabra… the strip turns blue!
 We look at the year-on-year change of the CPI, and adjust the dollar accordingly. For example, if CPI doubled between 2021 and 2022, then the 2022 dollar is adjusted to be worth half of the 2021 dollar.

LONDON (AP) — Johnny Depp is back in the witness box for a third day at the trial of his libel suit against a tabloid newspaper that called him a “wife- beater.” Depp is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that said he’d physically abused ex-wife Amber Heard. He strongly denies ever hitting Heard, but has faced tough questioning at the High Court in London from The Sun’s lawyer. Depp acknowledged Wednesday that he may have done things he can’t remember while he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Heard is due to give evidence later in the trial.
