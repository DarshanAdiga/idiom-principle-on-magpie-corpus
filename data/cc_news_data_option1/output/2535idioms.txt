Sólo la recaudación del IEPS a los cigarros cayó 51.5 por ciento a tasa anual, lo que implicó 645 millones de pesos menos para las arcas públicas.
 En tanto, la captación de impuestos por la venta de alcohol así como de cervezas y bebidas refrescantes disminuyó 15.4 y 17.4 por ciento, respectivamente.
 La recaudación de impuestos a juegos y sorteos también disminuyó en abril, 32.1 por ciento en comparación con el mismo mes de 2019.
 La falta de convivencia social debido al confinamiento es una de las principales causas detrás de estos resultados, según la consultora Kantar.
 Tan sólo en cuestión del alcohol, la firma análisis de mercados dijo que realmente es poco lo que llega a los hogares, siendo una de las razones la sana distancia y la falta de reuniones.
 “Viendo en general, el consumo de bebidas alcohólica sí cae en abril, como la cerveza, enfocándonos en esta es por la disminución de hogares compradores”, respondió Kantar a El Sol de México.
 Según la firma los hogares que siguieron adquiriendo esta bebida incluso tuvieron un ligero incremento, menor a uno por ciento.

Farming is not famed for its predictability. Every season, farmers and ranchers brace for the unknown: unforeseeable weather, difficult growing conditions, volatile markets, and a multitude of other challenges that can deliver a windfall harvest, or 12 hard months of barely scraping by. But even when accounting for the unpredictability that naturally accompanies growing crops, milking cows, and raising cattle, Idaho farmers and ranchers today face a level of market disruption that has not been seen in living memory.
 As Idaho continues its reopening of the economy, life is beginning to resemble something closer to “normal.” But even as restaurants welcome back their customers, the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to reverberate throughout farming communities. During a season that should have been characterized by favorable weather and high yields, Idaho’s farmers and ranchers instead watched helplessly from the sidelines as restaurants shuttered, supply chains buckled, and their successful harvests were suddenly left with no place to go. But even amid this crisis, we have seen inspiring acts of kindness from farmers and ranchers across the state.

NEW DELHI (AP) - Governments were stepping up testing and warily considering their next moves Monday as the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases surges in many countries. India reported 20,000 new cases Monday, while the U.S. confirmed more than 40,000 new infections for the the third straight day.As infections rise along with summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere, many governments are stepping up testing and mulling more aggressive moves such as renewed lockdowns to stem fresh outbreaks. India's 20,000 new infections was a new daily record. Several states reimposed partial or full lockdowns after the total number of cases jumped by nearly 100,000 in one week to 548,318. While some states have tightened precautions, in the worst-affected regions of Maharashtra, which includes India's financial capital, Mumbai, and Delhi, home to the federal capital of New Delhi, most restrictions have been eased, with restaurants, shopping malls and parks reopened, and public buses and shared-ride services back on the roads.The United States, the worst affected country, reported 42,600 newly confirmed infections as of Saturday, with the total surpassing 2.5 million, or about a quarter of all of the more than 10 million confirmed cases worldwide, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the actual numbers, both in the U.S. and globally, are likely far higher due to the large number of apparently asymptomatic cases and issues with testing.Beaches were closing and beer was going untapped as Florida, Texas and other states backpedaled on their pandemic reopenings, ordering mandatory use of masks in public places and closing down restaurants and bars in hopes of stemming a resurgence in cases. Nearly 8.3 million people out of some 21 million have undergone testing in recent weeks in the Chinese capital after an outbreak centered on a wholesale market. The country had 12 new cases Monday, including seven in Beijing, down by more than half from the day before, the National Health Commission reported.South Korean authorities reported 47 new cases as they struggled to curb outbreaks that have spread from Seoul to other regions. Widespread testing and contact tracing helped contain South Korea's initial outbreak in which it was finding hundreds of new cases a day in late February and early March. Most of those cases were in the area surrounding city of Daegu, where many were linked to a single church congregation with thousands of members.Tracing recent transmissions in the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about about half of the country's 51 million people, has proved to be more difficult. South Korean health officials have said they are ready to implement stronger social distancing measures -- including banning all gatherings of more than 10 people, shutting schools, halting professional sports, and restricting operations of non-essential businesses — if the daily increase in infections doubles more than two times in a week. Health authorities are using what they describe as a world-first saliva test for coronavirus in Australia's second-largest city, Melbourne in the state of Victoria, where the disease is spreading at an alarming rate.Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said Monday that 75 people had tested positive in the state in the latest 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to 2,099.Brett Sutton, Victoria's chief health officer, said the outbreak could surge out of control as pandemic restrictions ease elsewhere in Australia."l think it's a genuine challenge now. I think we're right at the edge in terms of being able to manage it," Sutton said.In the Philippines, local officials were under fire for allowing a street parade and dance during a weekend religious festival to honor St. John the Baptist despite quarantine prohibitions against public gatherings. Performers in native wear and face masks danced during the night procession, which drew a large crowd in Basak village on Cebu, in the central Philippines. The Philippines remains a Southeast Asian coronavirus hotspot with more than 35,000 confirmed infections, including 1,244 deaths. Restrictions have been eased in many places to help salvage the ailing economy, but Cebu resumed a strict lockdown this month after new cases spiked. Some governments are pushing ahead with reopening travel, particularly between countries where outbreaks of the virus appear to be contained, though the changing landscape of the pandemic suggests the process will be complicated and subject to change. The European Union is preparing a list of 15 countries whose nationals will be allowed to visit the bloc beginning Wednesday, Spain’s foreign minister, Arancha Gonzalez Laya, told the Cadena SER radio network. The resurgence of cases in the U.S. means Americans may not be on that list. Gonzalez Laya said countries will be chosen according to their coronavirus status and the reliability of their data, she said. "This is not an exercise to be nice or unfriendly to other countries, this is an exercise of self- responsibility," she said. She confirmed that Spain will reopen its borders with Portugal despite rising infections there. Meanwhile, civil aviation authorities in the United Arab Emirates announced they had suspended all flights to Pakistan until a "special laboratory" could be set up to conduct coronavirus tests for people traveling from the country to the UAE.The UAE's state-run WAM news agency issued a statement late Sunday from the country's General Civil Aviation Authority announcing the decision.Pakistan resumed international travel earlier this month even as its critics said the airport precautions were limited and ineffective. Last week, Pakistani media reported 27 passengers traveling from Pakistan arrived in Hong Kong and tested positive for COVID-19. The passengers had transited through the UAE.___Kurtenbach reported from Bangkok. Associated Press reporters from around the world contributed to this report. Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Mac Donald observes that many teachers not only are failing to help their students distinguish between real and imagined threats, they are rationalizing the use of force to stifle speech. For instance, during the setup for the Yiannopoulos event, “black-masked anarchists beat and pepper-sprayed [would- be] attendees and hurled explosive devices at police officers,” after which the administration canceled the speech (21). Déborah Blocker, associate professor of French, attempted to justify their violence in an e-mail stating, “They attacked property but they attacked it _very sparingly_ , destroying just enough University property to obtain the cancellation order for the MY event and making sure no one in the crowd got hurt” (22). Mac Donald makes clear that the “rioters’ [and their enablers’] nauseating sense of entitlement to destroy other people’s property and to sucker punch ideological foes” is an assault on the principles of free and civil society (22).
