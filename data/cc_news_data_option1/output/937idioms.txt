Cruise ships hit by coronavirus outbreaks have quickly found themselves with no ports for thousands of passengers as countries on four continents have quarantined vessels or kept them at sea for days.

Keeping all the passengers on board instead of letting them disembark on land is a strategy that can backfire, however, according to experts, because the ventilation systems and close quarters of cruise ships make them ideal places for illness to jump from one person to the next.

Verma is only 16 years old and yet has been one of the most threatening - and feared - batters this T20 World Cup has seen. Being compared with Sachin Tendulkar, her basic instinct is to whack the ball over the rope. The opener only debuted for India in September last year, but in her 18 international matches to date, has hit 58 fours and 21 sixes. That aggressive stroke play and instinct has elevated her in the world rankings, and earlier this week she became the newly crowned world No 1. T20 batter in the ICC player rankings. When India beat Australia in the World Cup's opening game on February 21, Verma smacked 29 runs off 15 balls (including five fours and one six) at a strike rate of 193, the best of any batter in that game. For the four games she played (India's semi-final was a washout and automatically qualified for Sunday's final thanks to their four group wins), she's hit 161 runs, with a 161 strike rate - the best of the entire tournament.

Jim Alexander is an Inland Empire native who started with his hometown newspaper, The Press-Enterprise, longer ago than he cares to admit. He's been a sports columnist off and on since 1992, and a full-time columnist since 2010. Yes, he's opinionated, but no, that's not the only club in his bag. He's covered every major league and major sports beat in Southern California over the years, so not much surprises him any more. (And he and Justin Turner have this in common: Both attended Cal State Fullerton. Jim has no plans to replicate Turner's beard.)

Ryan at Engadget says they've been chatting up one of the divinely chosen to lay eyes on the second-gen iPhone, and they're claiming a couple details we haven't heard before, as well as the by-now familiar: 3G and real GPS-- expected, and hoped for. Metal backing out, glossy black is in, with chrome volume buttons, which should help with signal issues. It's also a little fatter (probably cause of GPS and battery, which still isn't removable) but you can toss your stupid headphone adapter. The screen is the same size and res (we'd heard they were trying to move to plastic, but doesn't seem to be the case). He's guessing it could ship in July. [Engadget]
