Rather, Wise’s choice reflected an unfortunate human quality found among some leaders of Jewish organizations in every generation -- the tendency to get stuck in familiar patterns of behavior, to resort to the same old sermons and press releases and slogans; the inability to think outside the box, to recognize new realities, and to respond in ways previously unimagined. Elderly, ailing, and utterly unwilling to share his power with younger colleagues, Rabbi Wise proved to be the wrong man at the wrong time to stand at the helm of American Jewish leadership.

PLYMOUTH -- The Plymouth & Brockton Bus Company is still not running its service amid the coronavirus pandemic and low levels of travel across the state.
 The independent bus company, which runs routes from Cape Cod and the South Shore to Logan Airport in Boston, suspended its bus routes in March and it is unclear when they will resume again.
 "The ridership just isn't there," said Win Sargent, the company's chairman and chief executive in a phone interview this week. "Our primary concern when stopping service was safety of our riders and safety of our customers."
 The company said in a statement that many of its riders are working from home and not traveling.
 "We are eager to resume bus service; however, a restart date will be based on the health and safety of our passengers and employees, various transportation metrics, and status of the COVID-19 pandemic," the statement said. "Many of our passengers are still working from home and many employers are still developing reopening schedules that will be staged over several months. We continue to monitor the situation and will resume bus service as soon as possible."
 Sargent said his company is at the mercy of when people get back to work. He said he wasn't sure when his company would be able to run buses again.
 Plymouth & Brockton received between $1 million and $2 million dollars in loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program.
 The loans of up to $10 million charge just 1 percent interest, but can be forgiven if the businesses mostly uses the money to continue paying their workers. The loans are made by banks and other lenders and backed by the federal government. The program was meant to stanch the economic devastation wrought on small businesses by the coronavirus.
 Data from the federal government said the loans to Sargent's company were able to protect 62 jobs. Sargent said that was initially the case, but that he had to layoff bus drivers once the company paused service.
 Sargent said the bus company company hadn't used the money yet, and will use it when the company begins running buses again. He said the the liquidity from the loans will help jump start the bus service. Sargent said the company was in compliance with the program.
 The shutdown of bus service has left some riders upset.
 "It's so frustrating," said Michael Thomson.
 Thomson said he would regularly take the bus from Hyannis to Boston for work as a consultant. Without it, he has been left to drive himself or carpool. He said he's frustrated by the lack of information about when the service will resume.
 Sargent, of Pembroke, said the company recently invested in a new fleet of buses to improve rider experience and he's revamping the Plymouth-based business, which he said would be poised for success once they are able to feasibly begin operating again. Sargent acquired the Plymouth and Brockton Street Railway Company last year from the Anzuoni family along with Brush Hill Transportation, based in Randolph, and McGinn Bus Company in Lynn.
 In addition to running buses to Logan and T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island from the Cape via Fall River, Plymouth & Brockton Bus also ran a route to Provincetown on Cape Cod.
 Brush Hill Transportation, which provides charter bus services and tours, and McGinn, which runs a bus from Peabody to Logan and offers charter services, have also both shut down for the time being. Both companies received federal paycheck protection loans of between $150,000 and $300,000.
 Other private bus lines have started running again.
 Springfield-based Peter Pan Bus Lines, which received between $5 million and $10 million in federal paycheck protection loans, has resumed many of its routes after mostly stopping them due to the coronavirus. The company also runs a route from Hyannis to Logan, which they restarted in June. Throughout its entire network, Peter Pan's ridership is at about 15 percent of normal. The Cape is even farther behind, at about 10 percent, Frank Doherty, the bus line's vice president of operations said last month.
 Logan has not yet rebounded to its usual traffic. Logan saw 80 percent fewer passengers fly out of Boston in August as compared to last year, dropping from 409,000 to almost 76,000.
 Other transportation options have also not seen many passengers.
 The MBTA's commuter rail trains, which provide service from the suburbs to Boston, have taken a major hit. The MBTA reports commuter rail trains are at about 11 percent of usual ridership.

 # Area Fishing Report: Bass tournaments must follow requirements
 By Gary Simpson
 Outdoors Columnist
 Like many anglers, I have long enjoyed competing in bass tournaments. When you have a competitive sporting nature and you’re pretty good at catching fish, the on-the-water contests get in your blood.
 But among lovers of the sport, fishing tournaments evoke varied opinions.
 A sizable contingent feel that the tournaments must have been created in the pit of hell … and the detractors can recite a list of their perceived evils. While they pose some valid points, most of these folks are unaware of the degree to which major tournament organizations — let alone the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission — are committed to protecting tournament- caught fish (most especially, black bass). To boot, tournament anglers tend to care more about their finny targets than anyone. I don’t even know a serious tournament basser who would harvest a bass for dinner.
 All of this tournament talk has arisen since last weekend, when three contests were held out of the boat ramp at Orange Lake’s Marjorie K. Rawlings Park. Wally Grant and I fished in one of the two Saturday events … the eighth qualifier in the Lochloosa Division of the Xtreme Bass Series. Catches were good, by the way, but that’s not the point today. Another bass club (from somewhere ‘down south’) arrived with about 15 boats to launch and weigh in at the same time. That afternoon after weighing in, at least three of their teams were seen to dump their catches back into the canal at the launch site.
 As this is a big no-no, several of the Xtreme participants admonished the less-experienced club-level fishers from parts unknown. Fortunately, the fishermen in this visiting club had not caught many fish. We all shrugged it off, figuring little damage had been done.
 The bigger trouble started the next day, when yet another bass club launched at Rawlings Park. This group, too, was seen chunking their catches back in at the ramp. And this club was known. Now, FWC requires any group hosting a bass tournament to apply for and be granted a ‘Black Bass Tournament Permit’. In order to put on a legal bass tournament in Florida, a number of requirements listed thereon must be followed. One of them, Rule 13, is the strict directive that “Fish are to be live released in open water.”
 On Monday, a number of largemouth bass were seen in the Marjorie Rawlings boat ramp access canal, either struggling at the surface or dead. And that’s when the stuff hit the fan.
 Oddly, the offending club we rebuked Saturday could not be identified as no local in attendance had recognized any of its members — and, this club had evidently not even applied for a tournament permit.
 The Sunday group had a permit, but violated the open water release rule. They were located, cited and fined. The club’s Tournament Director acknowledged and apologized for the misstep.
 FWC Regional Fisheries Administrator, Allen Martin noted that weather conditions couldn’t have been much worse for the terms of the permit to have been broken, and explained part of the scientific reasoning behind Rule 13.
 “Dead end canals often have poorer water quality than lakes due to a lack of water flow within the canals. This is especially true in summer months as the water is really hot. Due to its physical properties, the hotter the water, the less dissolved oxygen it can hold. Therefore, in summer these canals have reduced oxygen levels to begin with.”
 “When you get several days of cloudy weather like we had at the end of last week and over the weekend, algae stops producing oxygen and starts consuming oxygen. Additionally, the high amounts of algae that grew during sunny conditions are not able to survive without the intense sunlight. The algae starts dying and decomposing and the decomposition process also uses oxygen.”
 Hence, the dead bass.
 For the last 40 years, Florida bass clubs have been passionately serious about caring for their catches. This attitude needs to continue. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s Black Bass Tournament Permit creates the possibility for an activity that would otherwise not be allowed. If conditions of the permit are found to be unmet many more times, we anglers with a competitive nature could lose the privilege.

As my fellow state attorneys general and I discussed with the President and the Attorney General earlier today, there are troubling instances of ‘fact checking’ by major social media outlets like Twitter that amount to selective censorship at worst and inconsistent application of terms of service at best. Social media sites like Twitter should be a forum where divergent opinions can meet and freedom of speech is protected, not a forum where certain opinions are valued over others. They can allow political debate and enjoy Section 230 protection, or they can promote some views and silence others without Section 230 protection. They can’t have it both ways. I will continue to work with other state attorneys general to explore our options to ensure that social media companies aren’t stifling freedom of speech.”

 “The RFL did a tremendous job again in getting that over the line. So there is a glimmer of hope that it does swing in our favour.
 “However, it would be very naive to start planning for that and hope is not a strategy so we need to plan and budget accordingly.
 “It’s so disappointing because the support we’ve had from our supporters and our partners has been absolutely tremendous. We’ve had over two-thirds not ask for any sort of refund on the season tickets, so we wanted to get a game on in front of them to pay them back, to say thank you.”

To delve deeper into astrocytes' role in sleep, she and her coauthors used a rodent model to record astrocytes' calcium activity throughout sleep and wake, as well as after sleep deprivation. They used a fluorescent calcium indicator that was imaged via tiny head-mounted microscopes that looked directly into the brains of mice as they moved around and behaved as they normally would. This indicator allowed the team to see calcium-driven fluorescent activity twinkling on and off in astrocytes during sleep and waking behaviors. Their one-of-a-kind methodology using these miniature microscopes allowed the team to conduct the first-ever study of astrocytes' calcium activity in sleep in freely behaving animals.

Villa are said to be targeting a No.8 for Dean Smith's squad and they can lean on the relationship built between Loftus-Cheek and their assistant head coach John Terry, who is a legendary player for the Blues.
 Meanwhile, West Ham would give Loftus-Cheek the chance to stay in London, with his only other previous loan spell coming at Crystal Palace in the 2017-18 season.
 Antonio Rudiger is another Blues player unsettled by the spending at Chelsea having dropped to fifth in the pecking order following the signing of Thiago Silva from Paris Saint-Germain.
 Barcelona have been offered Rudiger, while Roma and AC Milan are said to be interested in the defender who played in the Italian capital before his move to London in 2018.
 "The situation with both is that they weren’t in the squad," Lampard said as he explained why Loftus-Cheek and Rudiger weren't involved in the 6-0 win. "I had a similar answer from the other day; they just weren’t in the squad. That is just a choice at the moment.
 "Again, with the centre-halves I can’t have them all in the squad. I keep getting asked about the size of the squad. There might be movement, we know that, but nothing is concrete so don’t read too much into those selections at the minute.
 "It will have to be right for the club, the individuals and me in terms of what happens in the next couple of weeks."
 Villa are also interested in Ross Barkley but the Blues are reluctant to let the midfielder go after his resurgence under Lampard.
 Callum Hudson-Odoi, meanwhile, played the full 90 minutes in the 6-0 cup win over the Championship side on Wednesday but is understood to be unhappy at being further down the list in terms of Lampard's options.
 There has been no indication of how the Blues will handle the 19-year-old and his future but they have him tied down to a lucrative four-year contract despite interest building over a loan move.
 Bayern Munich, who tried to sign Hudson-Odoi 18 months ago, are said to be interested in making a temporary move for the youngster.
 The signing of Ben Chilwell means that Emerson Palmieri is on the market this summer, with the west Londoners asking for at least £22m ($28m) for the Italy international.
 The only club in the running to sign the defender so far are Antonio Conte's Inter, although they are cautious about making a move at that price.

Vivar and other supporters will be outside Mary Cheney Library at 2 p.m. Saturday handing out literature about their issues with 5G and ways people can contact their representatives.
 Vivar called his event a peaceful protest and said he is advocating for safe technology, rather than a ban across the board.

It's already Apple's most affordable iPad, but for a limited time, you can score it for less than $300: Both Amazon and Walmart have slashed $30 off the 32GB 10.2-inch iPad that just came out, bringing the price down to $299. (The same model is $329 on Apple's site.)

Sarà capitato a tutti di lavare un nuovo utensile da cucina, oppure un altro oggetto per la casa, e ritrovarsi alle prese con un’etichetta ostinata? Non si stacca del tutto, e se lo fa, lascia una macchia di colla che anziché svanire si fissa. Per non parlare di quando la colla finisce su un tessuto o sul tavolo di legno.

Because of its proximity to Madison and Dane County, the School District of Lodi went fully virtual to open the 2020-21 school year. Puls understands how it would then be hypocritical for the Blue Devils to play this fall.
 In the meantime, Puls is staying in touch with his team as best he can. While they aren’t playing, the Blue Devils are staying busy trying to remain in shape in the weight room. However, with the start of the new school year, Puls has tried to keep his distance, for the time being.

If Justice Ginsburg's family did not follow Jewish tradition by delaying her burial, in other respects they honored that tradition to the hilt. For example, the wooden casket lying in repose at the Supreme Court and in state at the Capitol remained firmly shut. And in keeping with Jewish practice, there was no public viewing of her body and, apparently, no embalming. Far from preserving the body, Jews believe, following the book of Ecclesiastes in the Hebrew Bible, that "the dust returns to the earth as it was" -\- the sooner the better.

Erin Eiselein, a shareholder at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck whose clients include hospitals, providers and large medical groups, said billing for telehealth services has been a significant point of change during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, for example, physicians couldn’t bill for physical therapy provided remotely. A temporary waiver because of the pandemic allowed doctors to provide physical therapy services using telemedicine, but the waiver was amended soon after its issuance to say it only applied to medical doctors — and then amended again to apply to providers across the board. Providers understanding how to correctly comply with the sudden changes is important, Eiselein said, because incorrectly billing for medical services can result in fraud charges.

 Pearson has grave concerns \- (Copyright PA Archive)
 Pearson’s words came after chancellor Rishi Sunak laid out his plans to further help the economy during the pandemic, and struck a slightly different tone to those of Warrington chief executive Karl Fitzpatrick.
 While also severely concerned and describing the decision to scrap pilot crowds in Super League as a “hammer blow”, Fitzpatrick said he remained confident the game could see out the crisis caused by coronavirus.
 Fitzpatrick’s club have already staged five matches behind closed doors at the Halliwell Jones Stadium – it is also the venue for this week’s round-13 fixtures – and were gearing up for the return of fans, initially restricted to 1,000.
 However, that all changed after the Government announced a tightening of restrictions to combat a rise in infections and Rugby Football League chief executive Ralph Rimmer has hinted that both major finals this season may now be played without crowds.
 “It was a hammer blow,” Fitzpatrick said. “We were all geared up ready to welcome crowds back.

He is also excited that he’ll get to play as the Huskies’ new facility, Elliot Ballpark.
 “UConn is definitely the place that I want to be,” Kron said. “Coach Penders and his staff did a great job recruiting me. They’ve put UConn back on the map and turned it into a powerhouse in the Northeast. I wanted to be a part of it.”
 Kron plans to major in business. He finished his sophomore year at Xavier on the Headmaster’s List, meaning he had a year-end grade-point average of at least 3.75 with no course average below a B.
 His father Ken played college baseball at Bentley while his sister Gretchen was an All-State soccer and basketball player at RHAM before settling on college soccer at Quinnipiac, where she is now a junior. But he wasn’t interested in following his sister to RHAM where she led her team to the Class L soccer tournament final and the Class L basketball tournament title as a senior.
 “I didn’t want to go to a public high school,” Kron said. “When I was in eighth grade it was either East Catholic or Xavier. Ultimately, the final decision came down to the football program. Xavier has a long history of winning and success and is a great program, very similar to UConn baseball. When I visited the school and met the people Xavier for the first time, I knew it was the right fit for me.”
 Kron won Xavier’s quarterback competition as a sophomore and completed 58.6 percent of his passes (116 for 198) for 1,518 yards and 13 touchdowns as the Falcons finished 5-5. He also rushed 86 times for 581 yards (6.8 yards per carry) and seven touchdowns.
 But like the spring, COVID-19 has cost him his football season though he’s hopeful the CIAC will approve a spring 2021 campaign.
 “It was upsetting last spring when we found out because we were so looking forward to it,” Kron said. “We’d be a young team but we had three great captains and it would have been a big development year for us. It was awful that we missed it.
 “In the summer with football we had started lifting and running and beginning to get into the swing of things. We thought we were going to have a season and then all of a sudden it was taken away. There are still a lot of ideas going around. We’re still practicing. Maybe we’ll have something in the spring or we’ll be a club team.”
 Whatever happens he’ll look to be at his best.
 “It’s hard, it’s hard for a lot of us,” Kron said. “This is my first year without football and that’s coming off baseball. But we’re in it together and we’re going to do what we can to stay positive and keep working hard.”

Nottingham Forest boss Sabri Lamouchi says his side “need to wake up and start our season” as they prepare to face fellow strugglers Huddersfield in the Sky Bet Championship on Friday.
 Forest have gone eight league games without a win following their 2-0 home loss at the hands of Cardiff last weekend.
 That defeat has increased the pressure on Lamouchi after Forest slid out of the play-off places last year before beginning the current campaign with three successive defeats in all competitions without scoring a goal.
 Forest have boosted their squad this week with the signings of Harry Arter and Scott McKenna, but head coach Lamouchi is now concentrating all his energy on Friday’s trip to the John Smith’s Stadium.
 “I am more focused on the game against Huddersfield,” Lamouchi told the club website.
 “The transfer window is open so we had this opportunity to sign some players.”
 He added: “But I am focused on the game against Huddersfield because we need to wake up and start our season. We know the season started two weeks ago, so we need to absolutely be at 100 per cent focus on this game.

Unlike car buyers, who are snapping up older vehicles, investors only seem to have eyes for things that are shiny and new these days.
 Longstanding used-car retailer CarMax recorded a year-over-year revenue increase of 3.3% in the quarter ended Aug. 31. That was a better result than the flat performance analysts had expected and a big improvement from the preceding quarter’s 40% drop. Used-car dealers across the board have had trouble replenishing their inventory, partly because fewer people traded in vehicles or returned leases...
