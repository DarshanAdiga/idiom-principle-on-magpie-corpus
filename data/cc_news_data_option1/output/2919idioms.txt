“We literally went from $400,000 gross sales to over a million in one year,” he says. “The second year, it doubled again.”
 During that period of explosive growth, the staff expanded from 12 to 25 to 40 employees, and rewarded their new employers with loyalty. More than 60 percent of the current staff has been at the Oasis for at least 20 years, and 10 percent for more than 30 years.
 “We’re blessed,” Marie says.
 The Oasis benefited from another unintended PR boom after an untrue rumor went “viral” in the early ’90s before social media was even a thing.
 The story started after Jane Fonda and Ted Turner dropped into the restaurant one night without a reservation and were unable to wait for table. The Westphals don’t know who embellished what happened and started talking about it, but before long, broadcasters across the county began telling listeners that Scott himself had come out of the kitchen and thrown the couple out of the restaurant, refusing to serve Fonda because of her anti-war activism during the Vietnam conflict.
 Though Westphal has always told anyone who asked that the story was completely unfounded, people still believed it because they wanted to, he says. Vietnam veterans from all over the U.S. flocked to the Oasis to show their appreciation, and those who didn’t visit sent letters.
 “People traveled far and wide, and we easily received over a million letters, cards and phone calls over a period of 10 years,” Westphal says.
 Close to home, the Oasis remains a popular destination for diners wishing to enjoy an authentic Montana steakhouse, homemade salad dressings, hand-cut potatoes, and the friendly and efficient service of the restaurant’s dedicated staff. While the Westphals flirted with the idea of selling the business a few years ago, the transaction fell through, and now they say it isn’t a good time to market a restaurant and bar for sale. The Oasis may remain in the Westphal family in perpetuity, however, as their son has expressed interest in taking it over someday.
 In the meantime, the Westphals continue to meet expected and unexpected challenges as they continue their lives’ work and think back over the past 40 years.
 “It’s been wonderful,” Scott says.

The legality of keeping chickens in Belgrade is now entirely up to citizens, after the city council voted Monday not to consider the matter for the fifth time in 10 years.
 During the public comment portion of this week’s meeting, two people asked the council to reconsider an ordinance that would permit residents to keep as many as six hens in their back yards. The council voted down the same proposal in December 2018, in keeping with former council decisions to deny chickens in 2014, 2010 and 2009.
 Prior to Monday’s vote, Mayor Russ Nelson suggested it would be better to let the community at large make the decision than for the council to take it up yet again.
 “If citizens bring enough signatures, we could put it on the ballot,” he said. “It will allow both sides to go out and campaign.”

Scott Westphal says he hasn’t really had a day off in 40-some years.
 Even so, the owner of Sir Scott’s Oasis in Manhattan decided against taking a break when he had the chance earlier this year. After restaurants in Montana closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Westphal, his wife Marie, and their staff spent the end of the Oasis’s 40th year in business extensively renovating the restaurant’s kitchen and bathrooms and reviving the décor in the building’s dining area, lobby and bar.
 By the time the Oasis’s official 40th anniversary date of July 1 rolled around, Sir Scott’s was once again open to customers, and business has been brisk ever since, Westphal says. Though there are fewer tables set up in the main dining area in order to comply with physical distancing regulations, those seats have been full and the restaurant’s to-go business has been brisk. Diners who choose to eat in are enjoying the freshened up interior, all of which has been completely finished for the first time in 20 or 30 years.

We attended the city council meeting this past Monday, July 20, with the purpose of asking for a public hearing on allowing backyard chickens in Belgrade.
 I would like to note that this now has been denied a fair chance for the fourth time, twice with a tie vote break by the mayor! They refused us a public hearing and require us to obtain 15% of Belgrade resident signatures to put it on the ballot. While we are taking measures to do this, we also deem it irresponsible of the city council considering the current risks affiliated with Covid 19 and exposing ourselves to thousands of people to obtain these signatures.
 All we asked was for a public hearing on the matter. However, their response was simply that they didn’t want to take the time to do a public hearing so we have to beat the pavement to get it on the ballot, which we are willing to do. They also mentioned that this could cost up to $5,000 to do so.
 We are hoping to get the word out about our petition. By signing this petition, you are signing for the right of the people to be able to vote to own back yard chickens. The ordinance is even more strict than our neighboring cities of Bozeman and Manhattan, but has yet to be met with an open mind. We would be happy to inform anyone about this current proposed ordinance and we are hoping to be able to spread the word and our cause.

Wayne K. Muenster      Seymour - Wayne Karl Muenster, 76, of Seymour, WI, passed away peacefully in his very well-deserved sleep Wednesday evening, July 15th, 2020. His church was outdoors in the woods and on his farm. His religion was nature and caring for the land and the animals. His heart was shared generously with those closest to him. His palette enjoyed the occasional sip of Crown Royal.      Through his selfless actions, tireless work ethic and through a great deal of strain on his body, he provided his wife of 54 years, Gin (Virginia) and his sons, Matt and Andy, with all they needed to build and provide for the rich lives they all lead today. A man of few words but a wealth of knowledge, he had a kind, guarded and deliberate soul. Often, his actions spoke louder than his words. To his wife, his sons and their spouses, Kate Walthour & Heather McDonald Muenster, and his very special and beloved grandsons, Jackson Andy Muenster & Rhys Avery Wayne Muenster, he made his love crystal clear. They were his true pride and joy.      Wayne is also survived by his sister Jean Errington and Judy Gonnering, sisters-in-law Donna Matenear, Carole Willems and Mary Lou Melchert, brothers- in-law Ron Kressin and Gary Melchert, as well as countless cousins, nieces, nephews, great-nieces, great-nephews, friends and neighbors.      He was greeted in heaven by his parents Clarence and Laura, Father and Mother- in-Law Walter and Ruth Melchert, brother Glenn, sister Carol Kressin, brothers-in-law Bill Errington, Ves Gonnering and Mike Willems.

Also at stake this year for the first time in two decades is another seat in Congress. As Montana gains residents and other states lose population, the census will determine if Montana needs more representation in the House of Representatives. That is important in determining if Montana gets its fair share of funding and other federal resources.
 The count inspires friendly competition. While at a redistricting conference last year, a census expert from Minnesota mentioned to me that his state may “lose” a congressional seat to Montana. Yes, I thought to myself. We have Bobcats and Grizzlies. Minnesota has … Gophers. We should have another seat at the table.
 It shouldn’t be a competition. An accurate count nationwide is in everyone’s best interest. However, if response rates are better in some states than others, the states with uncounted residents will get short shrift over the next decade.
 The Districting and Apportionment Commission that I chair relishes the opportunity to divide Montana into two districts so that residents from all corners of our vast state can more easily access their representative.

In other business, the council on Monday:
 • Scheduled a public hearing for Aug. 17 on a resolution to change the land use designation in the Bolinger 220 Plan from “future growth” to residential high density (R3) zoning, and to incorporate the plan into Belgrade’s Growth Policy. The 220 plan pertains to 220 acres of property north of the current city limits, just north of new elementary school currently under construction on Bolinger Road. The parcel is identified in the Belgrade Growth Policy as an area for future residential growth. Planning Director Jason Karp told the council developers intend to follow the current residential growth pattern of neighboring subdivisions, and will begin the process to annex, zone and subdivide the property, all of which much be approved by the Belgrade City Council. The Belgrade City-County Planning Board voted unanimously last month to recommend adopting the plan as an
 amendment to the Growth Policy, and recommended that the city and Gallatin County Commission follow suit. On Tuesday this week, the county commission approved the recommendation unanimously. The city council is expected to vote on the matter after the hearing on Aug. 17.
 • Scheduled a discussion to hear from fireworks vendors and fire department and police representatives about possible changes to the city’s fireworks ordinance. Council members and staff said they heard complaints from many citizens about the length of time they had to endure noise and nuisance from fireworks in the city in late June and early July this year. During Monday’s discussion, council members and police Chief E.J. Clark agreed more fireworks were detonated over a longer period of time this year than in the past. The council batted about ideas for shortening the timeline for legal sale and detonation of fireworks and/or tightening restrictions on the types of devices permitted. Mayor Russ Nelson said hearing from interested parties and stakeholders on Aug. 17 may help the council decide whether changes to the city’s current ordinance should be considered.
 • Approved agreements with Northwestern Energy to install new streetlights in the school corridor along Jackrabbit Lane and Spooner and Crown roads, as well as along Main Street.

NAMPA — Dressed in a brand new suit and ready to get on the bus to her first tournament, Kasey Moulton didn’t yet know what she was getting into.
 “If I could tell 14-year-old Kasey getting on that bus, that you're not just going to like this, but you're gonna love it, and it's gonna become everything you do … I wouldn’t have believed myself,” Moulton said.
 In the four years since, Moulton, who graduated from Columbia High School this spring, has qualified for nationals every year — one of only 90 students in the country to do so, according to the Nampa School District. She ranks in the top 25 nationally for competition points and GPA, and this year was recognized by the National Speech and Debate Association with the All American Award. She was chosen for the award from almost 200,000 student-members of the association’s Honor Society.
 “I set some almost unrealistic goals, starting my freshman year,” Moulton said. “And it's really crazy for me to say that I hit every one of them, even though I didn't expect to. And one of those goals was to make the top 25.”
 Moulton “hit the ground running” her freshman year, Nampa School District speech and debate coach Jeff Stoppenhagen said. “I think it was because of her success her freshman year that motivated her to do it for all four years.”
 Moulton this year was the top debater in Idaho with 3,055 competition points and a 4.15 GPA.

The eyes of the nation are on Glacier as climate change takes a visible toll on the park. While some early climate change models predicted that all of the park’s glaciers would disappear by 2030, Fagre said this might not be the best predictor of what will actually happen.
 “That model did not account for things we’ve learned since then so the glaciers may have a little more time,” he said. “Other recent models show glaciers gone by 2050 or later. But what we can say for certain is that these glaciers have been around 7,000 years, and they’ll be gone in just decades. Not centuries, just decades. The exact date that they’re all gone isn’t as important as the fact that they’re disappearing.”
 As a leading member of the Climate Change in Mountain Ecosystems (CCME) team, Fagre collects and analyzes data about the glaciers in Glacier National Park. Part of the team’s glacier monitoring project includes comparing records of glaciers in Alaska and Washington, as well as Sperry Glacier inside the park. While the other glaciers have records that stem back to the 1950s and ‘60s, Sperry has only been observed this way since 2005.
 “We don’t have as long a track record, but we’ve got to start sometime. We intend to follow Sperry until it is no more,” Fagre said.
 Mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to temperature changes because they are generally cooler to begin with,and less year-round snow increases heat absorption, Fagre said. Several species of insects that were recently added to the Endangered Species list experience the direct effects of climate change on glaciers and snow.
 “They’re highly dependent on cold water,” Fagre said. “So when you have your snowpacks becoming a little more erratic and not as large, and you have the glaciers disappearing as well as part of the same phenomenon, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to see that the environmental requirements that they need are changing in a negative way.”
 Sensitive organisms are feeling the impacts now and are likely to decline in the near future, while others may take a long time to show impacts, Fagre said. “The story is that there are always animals that gain ground. There are animals that will benefit from climate change.”
