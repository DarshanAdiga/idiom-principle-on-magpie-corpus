Chiou rejected Tatung’s attorney Lai Chung-chiang’s (賴中強) remark that disputes regarding voting rights are part of a firm’s self-governance.

It was sad to see a public company use “innovative measures” to disrupt corporate governance, he said.

“That statement clearly indicates that Tatung knew it had no right to cancel the voting rights of its shareholders, so it needed to apply for an injunction,” he said.

“We still have to evaluate our budget, the use rates of the current program and other factors, but it will not take too long,” she said.

Although Taiwan has largely been spared the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused great economic repercussions elsewhere in the world, the nation’s export-dependent economy was still affected by the global slowdown in consumption, Wang said.

“What Lin Kuo did was wrong and hence we do not think it was a fair election,” Chiou said.

In the past few days, President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) have touted the convenience of buying the vouchers at convenience stores.

Although it is the Ministry of Economic Affairs that decides whether to accept Tatung’s registration of its new board members or demand that it holds a new election, the center can do its part by filing the lawsuit, Chiou said, adding that although it might not resolve the situation swiftly, as a decision from a court would take a while, sooner or later Lin Kuo would pay for what she did.

“We do not represent any side in the dispute over Tatung’s management, but we are here to defend the rights of regular shareholders,” he said.

The government is launching the Triple Stimulus Voucher program to stimulate the economy amid an economic slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We have seen companies take possession of the ballots or make some votes invalid to win elections, but what Tatung’s management did was something we had never seen before — directly taking away shareholders’ voting rights,” he said.

Wang said that while paper vouchers offer more security, digital vouchers are more convenient and are suitable for younger, tech-savvy consumers.

“Gogoro scooters are designed and made in Taiwan,” Luke told the news conference. “They are the perfect complement to a program designed to stimulate the Taiwanese economy.”

People can purchase NT$3,000 of vouchers for NT$1,000, and aid is available for low-income households. The NT$50 billion program is not open to foreign residents unless they have a Taiwanese spouse.

So far, most people have claimed the vouchers at post offices or convenience stores, with only 20 percent claiming them digitally, Wang said.

Shareholders should be able to execute their rights unobstructed, he said.

“Unfortunately, it looks like the virus really never went away in many countries and will remain with us through the fall,” she said. “However, economies are reopening and we look forward to gradual gains.”

Asked about the possibility of there being more government stimulus measures, Wang said that there would be news soon.

Chiou said he was shocked and frustrated after Tatung held the election on Tuesday evening last week, as he could not imagine that something like this would happen in Taiwan.
