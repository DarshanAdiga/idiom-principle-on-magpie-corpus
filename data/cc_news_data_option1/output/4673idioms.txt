"I am thankful for the option of distance learning, but I do think there are many drawbacks! In my opinion, distance learning just can't compete with in- person," she said. "With in-person learning I can walk around the room and catch mistakes as they are happening. I can teach mini lessons as I see the need. I learn so much about what students need as I walk around. I can't see what distance learners are doing as they are doing it. Also, relationship building and just getting to know the students happens so much more naturally. The advantage to distance learning is that students have the opportunity to have access to a teacher when they can't physically be in school."

When he did start wrestling again, Taylor received only three more matches on Smackdown television, the first being the battle royale for the vacant World Heavyweight Title that was won by the Great Khali on July 17, the second being a singles match against Kane on July 24, and the third being a tag team battle royale on November 6. Though he was not doing much on television, Taylor remained active on the house show circuit, teaming with Paul Burchill against the Major Brothers on some shows and Jesse & Festus on others. He also briefly had a tag team with newcomer Drew McIntyre, including one notorious dark match against the Nasty Boys on on the November 20, 2007 in which the Nasties are alleged to have taken some liberties with the U.K. team. For what it's worth, Taylor has downplayed this in subsequent shoot interviews.

 Pigeon breeding demands constant attention, every single day of the year. Those demands had turned away many modern folk, once sending the sport into a decline.
 "To be the best, it has to be your life's work. For some, it may seem boring. Day in, day out. Winter and summer, always those pigeons." he said.
 Once bitten though, many remain committed for life. And the news that a pigeon can sell for $1.9 million could prompt new challengers to enter the sport. Bodengien welcomed that development but urged patience and a reality check.

Matthew Arnautovic — the son of Dragan ‘Machine Gun Charlie’ Arnautovic — was sentenced to 13 months jail with seven months non-parole in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday. He has already served about seven months waiting the outcome of his charges. The 32-year-old was told to “grow up” by magistrate Hayley Bate, who was unimpressed with Arnautovic’s “disturbing pattern of abuse”. “Your behaviour needs to change,” she said. “Domestic violence is not just prevalent, it is rife.“Our community demands there be a strong denunciation to this behaviour.” When Arnautovic’s girlfriend was taken to hospital by police on April 8 this year she had “extensive and significant bruising to her entire body,” the court heard. Police observed her “black eye, (and) bruising around the neck and jaw area” when they spoke to her at a hotel that evening. The court heard CCTV of the Eastland Shopping Centre car park captured Arnautovic’s scary actions towards his partner about 7.45pm. He pushed her onto the ground, stood over her in a threatening manner and then chased her when she ran away from him, prosecutor Jordan O’Toole said. The court heard after being arrested and remanded into custody, Arnautovic tried to pressure the woman into lying.It heard he called his mother from jail who then conference-called the victim — despite phone conversations out of prison being recorded. Audio of the conversations captured Arnautovic dictating what he wanted the woman he bashed to tell police. “Matt never hurt me or assaulted me in anyway whatsoever,” he told her to say. “I was drunk and he was trying to get me home safely.”Ms Bate characterised this as a “planned and calculating furtherance in his attempts to control his partner”. He pleaded guilty to five charges including assault, intentionally cause injury, and harassing a witness. The repeat offender landed his TV star and singer-songwriter former girlfriend in hot water in July last year. Bonnie Anderson was caught lying to police in an attempt to help him get out of a dangerous driving charge and pleaded guilty to failing to give information. She was put on a good behaviour bond but not convicted. The actress, who plays Bea Nilsson in the soap and was also the winner of this year’s The Masked Singer, is now dating model and tradie Brenton Goldsack. Arnautovic’s dad, Machine Gun Charlie, is a notorious heroin and ice dealer, also known for his hard-and-fast style in the boxing and kickboxing ring.

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.
 Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.
 In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

While Djokovic isn’t perfect, it would be shortsighted to not appreciate the value of an external voice at the table brings. After working as the President of the ATP Players Council for four years and attempting to bring about change internally, he took a leap of faith and advocated for changes to the pay gap by branching out on his own. Some may call the PTPA a power grab by Djokovic, but, with no backing from a majority of top-20 players, it's hard to make that argument. While Nadal and Federer may tweet out sweet nothings about “stand[ing] united” and “working…together,” the lack of action to confront these problems is what speaks volumes. Both players quit the council in 2012 and 2014 respectively and only rejoined in 2019, after a falling out that caused three other players to resign mid-term.

The first WCW television taping with the Eaton/Taylor version of the Blue Bloods occurred on January 18, 1996, and that was the exclusive version of the team until Regal returned from his surgery, at which point they began working in a variety of combinations, though interestingly they never did a six man tag match with Regal, Eaton, and Taylor all together. One notable match that the team had occurred on a July 21, 1996 house show in Greenville, South Carolina, with Eaton and Taylor losing to the makeshift team of Eddie Guerrero and Robert Gibson. The latter team was formed at the last minute because Ricky Morton, Gibson's regular partner in the Rock n' Roll Express, was taken off the show due to his father suffering a heart attack. According to the July 29, 1996 _Wrestling Observer_ , Guerrero did Ricky Morton's act to a tee, and that, combined with the presence of Gibson and Eaton, allowed the match to be wrestled like an old Rock n' Roll Express/Midnight Express match, much to the delight of the South Carolina crowd.

South Australia has seen a surge in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks.

Everyone who participated in the Sheffield Shield have been asked to self-quarantine. Players and support staff hailing from Tasmania, Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria all returned home from their Sheffield Shield hub in Adelaide last week.
 Among the players asked to self-isolate is Australia's Test skipper Tim Paine. As per guidelines, state governments have asked all players and staff to quarantine themselves if they returned home from Adelaide after November 9, ESPNCricinfo reported.
 "Like all people who have travelled from South Australia to Tasmania in the last seven days, the Tasmanian Tigers Sheffield Shield squad are self- isolating as we wait for further advice from Public Health. Players and staff have Covid-19 swab tests scheduled for later today," ESPNCricinfo quoted a Cricket Tasmania spokesperson as saying.
 India and Australia are set to square off against each other in the first Test of the four-match series in Adelaide. The match is still one month away, but there are people who have started getting worried about the cluster of cases reappearing in South Australia.
 The first Test match is scheduled to be played at Adelaide Oval from December 17 and this will be a day-night contest.
 The India squad and the Australia players who were at the Indian Premier League are currently undergoing 14 days quarantine in Sydney.

Senate Finance Chairman Craig Blair said Friday he is the likely next president of the state Senate.
 Blair told MetroNews’ Hoppy Kercheval Friday he had unanimous support from both the Republican and Democratic caucuses to take the orderly helm of the state Senate in January.
 The Republican from Berkeley County said he plans to keep Sen. Tom Takubo, R-Kanahwa, as majority leader, and name Sen. Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, to replace him as Finance Chairman.
 When first elected as a Republican to the House of Delegates in 2002, Blair said he had no way to know the state would come to elect Republican supermajorities in both legislative chambers, let alone become a Senate President in-waiting.
 “We’re still very early in the process of shaping [our priorities] up, but our goal will remain the same as it’s always been: To make West Virginia the best place to live, work, and raise a family,” Blair said in an email to the Gazette-Mail Friday. “One of the key elements to that is building our broadband infrastructure — especially in light of the ongoing pandemic — and I think you’ll see us focus on that pretty strongly this upcoming session.”
 Blair, 61, is projected to replace current Senate President Mitch Carmichael, R-Jackson, who lost his primary election in June.
 Takubo and Senate Education Chairwoman Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, had been mentioned, along with Blair, as potential successors to Carmichael. On Friday, Blair said he expects Takubo and Rucker to remain in their current leadership positions, saying they both were “amazing senators” and either of them could have easily done the job of Senate President.
 Blair’s ascent to the President’s podium wasn’t entirely sealed up Friday, as the Democratic and Republican party caucuses will meet in early December to formalize their legislative leadership plans. The next Senate President will not be officially named until the Senate elects Carmichael’s replacement on the first day of the 2021 legislative session, Feb. 10.
 Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, said leaders in the House were excited to work with their colleagues, new and old, in the 2021 legislative session.
 “Senator Blair’s long history of legislative service has certainly prepared him to step into Senate leadership,” Hanshaw said. “We look forward to a strong and productive working relationship if he is elected Senate President in January.”

First off, many important players in the squad who were already older simply retired or moved on in their careers. Team captain Philipp Lahm, as well as Miroslav Klose and Per Mertesacker, retired from international duty following the 2014 World Cup. Lahm retired from football in 2017, Klose in 2016 and Mertesacker in 2018. Several other players visibly saw age catch up to them as well. Benedikt Howedes retired from football this year and has not played a match for Germany since 2017 and Roman Weidenfeller last played for Germany in 2015 before retiring for good in 2018. Lukas Podolski retired from international duty in 2017 and has since been winding down his career with clubs in Japan and Turkey. While it definitely hurt the national team to lose players of this quality, it was inevitable and expected given their age.

On the other hand, the polls show how the media and Big Tech have changed American society.

The likes of Nate Silver know that the likes of Jeff Zucker and Jeff Bezos aren’t interested in what the public thinks. They are intent on telling the public what to think. The pollsters’ questions and polling samples did just that by predicting the desired results.

Only a decade ago, the record price for a pigeon stood at one-tenth of New Kim's price. And the current price of gold stands about 26,000 euros ($30,350) per pound.
 As so often, globalization has made the difference.
 With the rise of business wealth in China came also conspicuous consumption and a new venue for gambling. Somehow, pigeons fit the bill. China often features one-loft racing, where pigeons all get used to one coop for months and then are released many hundreds of miles away to make their way back with their unique sense of orientation and special speed training. Prize pots can reach into the tens of millions of euros.
 For breeding, though, there is no place like Belgium. This is where, little more than a generation ago, the national weekend radio news was followed by announcements on whether pigeons were released in faraway places in France or even Spain and what weather conditions the birds were facing.

Las casas del abuelo se caen en la inmensa mayoria de los concellos del rural. Este tipo de inmuebles se ha convertido durante la pandemia en uno de los principales atractivos para quienes quieren huir de la ciudad en busca de la tranquilidad que ofrece la aldea. Pero el lugar elegido para la nueva morada requiere de unas infraestructuras y unos servicios que no todos los ayuntamientos pueden garantizar en la actualidad; y estas carencias al final frustran la ansiada captacion de poblacion y la creacion de empleo en los pequeños ayuntamientos. El sector inmobiliario de la comunidad quiere dar un vuelco a la Galicia vaciada con un plan que frene el desmoronamiento de viviendas porque sus propietarios se resisten a reformarlas o porque las trabas administrativas acaban frustrando cientos de proyectos de rehabilitacion.
 Con el objetivo de optar a las partidas de la UE para reactivar el rural gallego, la patronal inmobiliaria en la comunidad prepara un proyecto que remitira a la Xunta que persigue fomentar la rehabilitacion y comercializacion de propiedades en los ayuntamientos del rural y, en consecuencias, fijar poblacion en el rural y recuperar el patrimonio arquitectonico. Para ello, la Federacion Gallega de Empresas Inmobiliarias (Fegein) propondra la creacion de una plataforma digital online en colaboracion con los municipios de menos de 20.000 habitantes, un total de 291 -el 93% del total- con el objetivo de dinamizar la economia de las empresas del sector y las actividades vinculadas a el.
 Ante la paralisis en la construccion de edificios, la patronal gallega pone en el punto de mira la rehabilitacion de viviendas, una actividad que da trabajo a pequeñas y medianas empresas que emplean a mas del 70% de los trabajadores del ladrillo.
 Como prioridades, los empresarios inmobiliarios fijan cuatro puntos. En primer lugar, defienden la creacion de una ventanilla unica digital para los tramites sobre rehabilitacion con el objetivo de reducir la burocracia con las diferentes administraciones. Ademas, propone la constitucion de convenios de colaboracion con ayuntamientos y con colegios de arquitectos y de abogados para simplificar la documentacion. En tercer lugar, plantean la elaboracion de una revista digital en la que se recoja toda la oferta de propiedades y asi poder comercializarlas en Internet y en ferias inmobiliarias, tanto nacionales como internacionales. Y por ultimo, apuestan por dar apoyo a los concellos en convenios de colaboracion publico-privado con soporte fisico y digital.
 "La importancia, no solo de dinamizar este sector, sino con el toda la economia auxiliar, es vital para que muchas pequeñas y medianas empresas conserven sus cuadros de personal", apunta el presidente de Fegein, Benito Iglesias.
 La creacion de una ventanilla unica que permita telematicamente desde cada ayuntamiento tramitar el papeleo y las gestiones de cada rehabilitacion es una vieja reivindicacion de la patronal inmobiliaria. Este modelo evitaria el "farragoso" proceso de acudir a los distintos departamentos implicados en la reforma de un inmueble ( Concello, Patrimonio, Instituto Galego de Vivenda e Solo...) que acaban "eternizando" el proceso. Para ello, el sector hace un llamamiento a los concellos de menos de 20.000 habitantes para sumarse al proyecto.
 La puesta en marcha de esta plataforma digital, segun apuntan desde Fegein, permitiria "promocionar" el rural gallego, aproximaria el proyecto a todos los segmentos de edad, "sobre todo al colectivo de menores de 35 años", que es el que busca vivienda pero que en el actual contexto economico no cuenta con demasiados recursos para acceder a un inmueble.
 Una vez finalizada la redaccion del proyecto, la patronal lo remitira a la Xunta con el objetivo de que la iniciativa se haga con financiacion de la UE.

The Dragon capsule carrying three Americans and one Japanese is due to reach the orbiting outpost late Monday and will remain there until spring. The astronauts named their capsule Resilience in light of the coronavirus pandemic and other hardships of 2020. SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk was sidelined by the virus himself. He says he “most likely” has a moderate case of COVID-19.

New Kim is worth her weight in gold and then some -- actually much, much more.
 A wealthy Chinese pigeon racing fan put down a record price of 1.6 million euros ($1.9 million) for the Belgian-bred bird, saying a lot more than merely what kind of money can be made in the once-quaint sport, which seemed destined to decline only a few years back.
 During a frantic last half hour Sunday at the end of a two-week auction at the Pipa pigeon center, two Chinese bidders operating under the pseudonyms Super Duper and Hitman drove up the price by 280,000 euros ($325,000), leaving the previous record that Belgian-bred Armando fetched last year well behind by 350,000 euros ($406,000).
 Super Duper got the hen, and behind the pseudonym is said to be the same wealthy Chinese industrialist who already had Armando, allowing for breeding with the two expensive birds.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden's scientific advisers plan to meet with vaccine makers in coming days even as a stalled presidential transition keeps them out of the loop on government plans to inoculate all Americans against COVID-19. President Donald Trump's refusal to accept that he lost the election means that the Biden team lacks a clear picture of the groundwork within the government for a mass vaccination campaign that will last the better part of next year, says Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain. “We now have the possibility ... of a vaccine starting perhaps in December or January,” Klain said. “There are people at HHS making plans to implement that vaccine. Our experts need to talk to those people as soon as possible so nothing drops in this change of power we’re going to have on January 20th.” A lack of coordination between outgoing and incoming administrations would be especially problematic in a worsening public health crisis, said the government's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. “Of course it would be better if we could start working with them,” said Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been through multiple presidential transitions during 36 years of government service. He likened the process to runners passing on the baton in a relay race. “You don’t want to stop and then give it to somebody,\" he said. “You want to just essentially keep going.” The president-elect's outreach to vaccine manufacturers comes as the coronavirus pandemic in the United States has entered perhaps its most dangerous phase. The seven-day rolling average for new daily cases stood at 145,400 on Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That means the U.S. is adding about 1 million new cases a week, and deaths...
