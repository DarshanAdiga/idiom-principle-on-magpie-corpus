 JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Brown-robed Franciscans stride through a shuttered and deserted Jerusalem to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the global focus of the most important festival in the Christian calendar - but in a city bereft of Easter pilgrims.
 Among them is Father Francesco Patton, 56, the custodian of the Holy Land for the Roman Catholic church, responsible for protecting its sacred sites.
 "We are living in strange days. Usually at this time the Old City was full of ...pilgrims coming for Holy Week," he said after his group prayed outside the locked door of the church that is their base.
 The Franciscans' ceremonial walk along the Via Dolorosa marks the journey that Christians believe Jesus took to his crucifixion and resurrection.
 This Easter the route bears new bronze reliefs depicting that journey, a gift from Verona sculpted by Italian artist Alessandro Mutto. But there is no-one to see them.
 "Now it is a little bit sad to see that ...nobody is able to walk (it). But we know that at this moment so many people are walking a personal Via Dolorosa, when I think of those who are in the hospital and in their houses fighting with coronavirus," Patton said.
 COVID-19 has infected more than 8,600 in Israel, with 52 fatalities. Residents are locked down in their homes for all but essential activities, which do not include religious ceremonies.
 So the Christian denominations that share custody of the Holy Sepulchre face closures unprecedented in living memory, as do Jewish and Muslim leaders in a city that has sites sacred to all three faiths. Passover, Easter and Ramadan all fall this month, with Catholics celebrating Easter on April 12.
 Like other clergy, Patton's Franciscans conform with social distancing guidelines as they say prayers along the Via Dolorosa, stopping at the 14 Stations of the Cross that mark events leading up to Jesus' burial.
 When they arrive at the Sepulchre, they pray for the sick and the dying around the world, and the medical staff treating them - as Patton's predecessors treated the sick in medieval times.
 "A small Franciscan community started to live in the Holy Sepulchre in 1333, so you can imagine what it means for us, this place," Patton said.
 "...The responsibility to pray in the place in which Jesus conquered death, to pray for all those who are, in this moment, very (much) in the face of death."

"articleBody" : "Police have thanked vigilant rural communities for managing to help recover stolen quad bikes within hours of their thefts.In the space of two days last week, three people were arrested in the Yorkshire Dales in connection with stealing quads in two separate incidents.North Yorkshire Police praised the countryside community spirit of the small village of Burnsall following one of the incidents.Witnesses called police with a report that a quad bike and a car had been driven at speed through Burnsall, heading towards Bolton Abbey, near Skipton on 26 March.The bike, a red Honda, was followed by a silver Ford Fiesta. Quick-thinking local residents had used a WhatsApp group to share the suspicious circumstances with each other, and as a result contacted the police with information.A short time later, police officers on the A65 stopped a Ford Fiesta and asked the two occupants about their journey – considering the current government instruction to avoid non- essential travel.Given the circumstances, the two people in the Fiesta, a 21-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman, were both arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary. The man was also arrested on suspicion of drug driving, and possession of cannabis. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.The following day, on 27 March, a witness reported that he had seen a suspected stolen quad bike being ridden through Burnsall.The quad bike subsequently crashed into a hedge near Addingham, and the rider was detained by members of the public until police officers arrived.A man was subsequently charged with theft of a motor vehicle, driving without a licence, and driving without insurance, and has already appeared in court.And in a third incident, on 29 March, a red Suzuki King quad bike was stolen from Langthorne, near Bedale.Although no one has been arrested in connection with this incident, an appeal for information on social media has already prompted a good response from members of the public.Inspector Matt Hagen, of North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce, said that due to the community spirit, police arrested three suspects and two bikes recovered last week."With the vast majority of people doing their bit to help stop the spread of coronavirus, it’s almost beyond belief that thieves would continue to prey on rural areas, targeting quad bikes and other high-value equipment," he said.“With lambing season in full swing, many farmers rely on their quads for their work at this time of year. And with restrictions in place due to coronavirus, it’s more important than ever that farmers can keep working to put food on our tables."We’ll continue to target thieves who come to North Yorkshire looking to steal quads, and I’d ask people to continue to contact us with information about suspicious activity."Enquiries are ongoing for the third incident, and anyone with information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 12200051898.",

A steady progress in the development of autonomous vehicles is being witnessed with some of the renowned car manufacturers collaborating with the technology leaders for it to be conceptualized. Autonomous vehicles have evolved on the platform built by ADAS. Companies like Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Tesla, Mercedes, Honda and other major manufacturers have been investing billions of dollars in the research & development of these cars. Also, technology giants like Apple, IBM, and Intel have further collaborated with the leading auto manufacturers to remain competitive. In the next few years, it is anticipated that the autonomous cars would hit the roads and be commercialized. One of the key enabling technologies required in the autonomous vehicles is the presence of sensor fusion, whose function would be of integrating data from an array of sensors to make quick and appropriate decisions. Fusion sensor allows manufacturers to use inexpensive and less powerful sensors, and also save battery life of the car whereas provide maximum functionality.
