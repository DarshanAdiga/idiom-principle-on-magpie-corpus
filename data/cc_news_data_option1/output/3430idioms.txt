Starring Channing Tatum, Matthew McConaughey, and a crew of other talented, eye-catching actors, 'Magic Mike' is set in the world of stripping. The film follows the story from the perspective of someone who has spent a lot of time in the business, and another from the point of view of someone who is only starting to get a taste of it. The story takes many twists and turns in their lives, and in between this, we also get to see the action on and off stage at a strip club. If you want to know where the movie has been filmed, here's the answer.

Wrongfully-convicted Tampa man finally freed after 37 years behind bars


--DocBreak--
One person was shot and killed in Portland, Oregon, as a large caravan of Donald Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters clashed in the streets, police have said. It was not clear if the shooting was linked to fights that broke out as a caravan of about 600 vehicles was confronted by counter-demonstrators in the city centre.Police said the caravan had left the area at around 8.30pm local time on Saturday, and officers heard gunshots at about 8.46pm, according to a statement.Officers arrived at the shooting scene &ldquo;within a minute&rdquo;, police said, but the man who was shot did not survive. An Associated Press freelance photographer heard three gunshots and then observed police medics working on the victim, who appeared to be a white man.The freelancer said the man was wearing a hat bearing the insignia of Patriot Prayer, a right-wing group whose members have frequently clashed with protesters in Portland in the past.Police previously said the man was shot in the chest.He was not immediately identified and it is unclear who shot him.Portland has been the site of nightly protests for more than three months since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Many of them end in vandalism and violence, and hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested by local and federal law enforcement since late May.In the two hours following the shooting, protesters gathered in the city centre and there was sporadic fighting and vandalism, police stated.Some gave speeches in Lownsdale Square Park before the protest petered out.Ten people were arrested, police said.The caravan had arrived in the city centre just as a protest planned for Saturday was getting under way.The chaotic scene came two days after President Trump invoked Portland as a liberal city overrun with violence in a speech at the Republican National Convention as part of his &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; re- election campaign theme. The caravan marked the third Saturday in a row that Trump supporters have rallied in the city.Mr Trump and other speakers at this week&rsquo;s convention evoked a violent, dystopian future if Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden wins in November and pointed to Portland as a cautionary tale for what would be in store for Americans.The pro-Trump rally&rsquo;s organiser, who co-ordinated a similar caravan in Boise, Idaho, earlier in the week, said in a video posted on Twitter on Saturday afternoon that attendees should only carry concealed weapons and the route was being kept secret for safety reasons.The caravan had gathered earlier in the day at a suburban shopping centre and drove as a group to the heart of Portland.As they arrived in the city, protesters attempted to stop them by standing in the street and blocking bridges.Videos from the scene showed sporadic fighting, as well as Trump supporters firing paintball pellets at opponents and using bear spray as counter-protesters threw things at the Trump caravan.The shooting happened several hours after the caravan began arriving in Portland. The Black Lives Matter demonstrations usually target police buildings and federal buildings.Some protesters have called for reductions in police budgets while the city&rsquo;s mayor and some in the black community have decried the violence, saying it is counterproductive.Early on Saturday morning, fires set outside a police union building that is a frequent site for protests prompted police to declare a riot.An accelerant was used to ignite a mattress and other debris that was laid against the door of the Portland Police Association building, police said in a statement.

Wenn Corona der Plan der Eliten ist, warum sollten sie ihn dann öffentlich machen oder nicht auch einen Plan B haben? Plan A wäre, die Totalitäre Weltdiktatur über die Pandemie zu errichten. Plan B, den Schwindel auffliegen zu lassen und dem Volk die Mittel in die Hand zu geben, selbst die Mauern einzureißen, aus deren Trümmern dann wieder ein lenkbares System entsteht. Und nebenbei bemerkt, die Investoren aus dem fernen China werden sich ihre Beute egal von welcher Regierung nicht freiwillig aus der Hand nehmen lassen. Dann gibt es vielleicht noch einen Plan C, von dem niemand etwas weiß. Ganz sicher aber haben die meisten der Frustrierten keinen Plan und wollen am Ende für irgendjemanden stimmen, der die Sache wieder in Ordnung bringen soll. Wer könnte das sein? Jesus Christus, der Mahdi, Buddha oder doch wieder nur irgendeine Politsekte mit einem gekauften Anführer?

TRIMMER, Lola


  Lola passed away on Tuesday, August 18, 2020 with family by her side. She was our strong, loving, strikingly beautiful wife, mom, sister, Nanas, and friend. Her signature jet black hair, fiery red lips, and always "dressed to the nines", will never be forgotten. She had an unforgettable personality that lit up any room she entered. Lola and Carl were married on March 26, 1960 and together they raised five children, Tom (Paula) Trimmer, Rick (Lila) Trimmer, Debbie (George) Carlson, Lori (Dwayne) Myers and Kim (Brian) Gardner; 13 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. Lola and Carl made lifetime memories, with Lola's famous tamales on Christmas Eve, and Sunday BBQ's on the patio. Memories include watching her dance in the arms of the man she loved for more than 60 years, sitting by his side as they drove away in her '59 Ford Fairlane. Lola was Carl's number one fan as he raced his way to Victory Circle over 700 times in his career. Lola will be missed by Carl, their beloved kitty, Ginger and her family including two brothers, Tony (Helen) Esquivel and Ignacio Esquivel. We take comfort knowing that she is reunited with her parents, sisters, brothers, friends and her precious granddaughter, Vicki Lynne, all who left this world before her.

Two-time ISL champions Chennaiyin FC on Sunday announced the appointment of experienced Csaba Laszlo as their head coach for the 2020-21 season.
 It will be the 56-year-old Hungarian Laszlo’s first stint in Asia. He has more than two decades of coaching experience at club and international level.
 The Romania-born Laszlo had coaching stints in eight countries, including two national teams – Uganda and Lithuania.
 Laszlo replaced Owen Coyle, who took the team to the final in the 2019-20 ISL season. Coyle recently moved to Jamshedpur FC as their head coach.
 “I am incredibly proud and happy to become the Head Coach of Chennaiyin FC. It is my privilege to join the club on its completion of six successful years. I believe Chennaiyin is a close-knit family-like club that chases excellence with absolutely passionate fans by its side at all times,” the Hungarian was quoted as saying in a media release.
 “And I’m so happy now to be a part of this family. Together with my coaching staff, we will do everything possible to take Chennaiyin to greater heights.”
 Chennaiyin FC co-owner Vita Dani said Laszlo has the credentials to bring success to the club.   “We are excited to bring Csaba onboard as Head Coach and believe he has the perfect credentials to bring success to our club. Along with his experience of coaching at the highest level in various leagues and countries,” Dani said.
 “Csaba also possesses proven expertise in unearthing and nurturing youngsters. Promoting budding Indian talent is at the forefront of our objectives at Chennaiyin, and Csaba fits the mould perfectly in that regard as well,” she added.
 CFC had recently announced the retention of 11 Indian players from last ISL season’s squad, apart from retaining the services of Brazilian duo of defender Eli Sabiá and creative midfielder Rafael Crivellaro.
 A central midfielder himself, Laszlo’s playing career comprised a host of clubs in Romania, Hungary and erstwhile West Germany before he was forced to retire due to a knee injury at the age of 27.
 His early coaching career included a spell at the Borussia Monchengladbach B team, where he oversaw the discovery of several future stars, most notably German international and Fifa World Cup bronze medalist Marcell Jansen.
 He worked as assistant to German World Cup-winning legend Lothar Matthäus at the Hungary national team.
 Laszlo also became head coach of Hungarian giants Ferencváros and he won the 2005 Hungarian Coach of the Year award. He then assumed the role of Ugandan national team boss, whom he took from 167 to 97 in the Fifa world rankings. He has also served as head coach of the Lithuanian national team.
 Laszlo then made the switch to Scottish top-flight side Heart of Midlothian (Hearts) and helped them finish third in the standings and secured qualification to the inaugural Uefa Europa League.
 Subsequently, he coached clubs in Belgium (Charleroi), Hungary (MTK Budapest), Slovakia (Dunajská Streda) and returned to Scotland with Dundee United in the 2017-18 season. His last coaching stint was with Romanian club Sepsi OSK.

My article today is about another era — the “Band Era” of the United States. Would you believe the tray in my picture is from 1957, and definitely depicts an era full of of popular big bands and many different kinds of music. I feel that this is a fun little keeper and reminds me of the days we sat around the TV on a Saturday evening and would watch this band and its music director perform “golden oldies,” as well as the latest music of the time. I have to admit, during the 1950s we were able to actually understand the words of the songs as well as dance to their music. It reminds me of many Saturday nights sitting on the floor watching the show with Mom and Dad — if Dad had come out of the field early or he was finally caught up with feeding cows and farm work, he would be there in the front room with Mom.


  The ’50s was a time when all kinds of different music had hit the headlines as more people had television sets by that time. Naturally, this happened to be one of the more fun shows to watch as they had a special couple who would dance on stage — and they definitely knew how to “cut a rug.” I probably just showed my real age by using that phrase. But, it is the truth — there was beautiful waltzes and polkas, two-steps and many others played out on stage. And, the best part: Everyone was enjoying themselves and all who were watching would do the same. As Mr. Welk would always start the music with his magic wand and a “one and uh two and uh three,” if I remember right! It was always done in a very respectful mood as well as presentation, for sure. Maybe this little article this week will bring back a few memories for others as this tray did for me when I found it a while back. The tray has the special words printed at the bottom “The Champagne Musicmakers!”


  I learned how to dance with everyone, all ages, in a neighbor’s barn at their fun barn dances many years ago. I was probably around 8 or 9 years old, and they had them for several years — and maybe a few other North Platte natives might remember the beautiful dances held in the Hotel Pawnee’s Grand Ballroom during the winter months. It was so fun to watch my parents and so many other couples having a good time and dancing to all kinds of music in front of a band. Many times it would be local people or music teachers from the high school or surrounding towns who actually completed the band. All kinds of music that fit everyone’s style — and kids were allowed to go also. Again, that is when you learned how to dance with everyone, young or old — what wonderful memories this tray has brought back to me and I hope it does for you, also.

Bite expert Howard Carter, who invented his own mosquito repellent, told Daily Star Online there was set to be a “feeding frenzy” until November.


  And with millions of holidaymakers opting for staycations this year, mozzies will have plenty of targets.


  He said: “With the mosquito outbreak and you’re going to see more of them throughout September as the forecast is lots of sunshine that means there is going to be a feeding frenzy until November.


  “They will take her final meal to take diapause for the winter. We are going to have a lot unless there is a really terrible winter - and there will be huge amounts next year as well.


  “And the warm weather means they fly faster - the hotter it is, the faster they can fly to a certain degree.

Greater Nebraska hometowns across the state already exhibit the safety and security young Nebraskans seek. The state’s crime rate is consistently lower than many others in the United States and recent Nebraska Crime Commission reports have found decreasing crime rates in Nebraska communities with fewer than 100,000 residents.


  Additionally, NCF’s affiliated funds have equipped more than 250 Nebraska hometowns with the tools to provide additional amenities youth desire. For decades, volunteers across the state have worked together to unleash the abundant assets of their communities, building the capacity to create the types of places where schools thrive, neighbors collaborate toward a brighter future and families build the lives they want.


  “The qualities young Nebraskans most value in a community — low crime rate, good schools, proximity to family — are characteristics Nebraska is already offering in spades,” said NCF President and CEO Jeff Yost. “Adults and local institutions should strive to make those qualities apparent by engaging our youth and offering them the opportunity to make their hometowns their own.”


  The results of the Youth Survey reveal the priorities, values and desires of young Nebraskans as well as factors that may influence their decision to return to or remain in Greater Nebraska in the future. The hope is that these data may serve as a resource for Nebraska Community Foundation’s network of 1,500 community volunteers, as well as other organizations and entities that share an interest in people attraction.

But, garage and yard sales have been abundant — estate sales, too, sad to say — but still all is a part of our lives and our memories hold so dear. With the new shop opening in North Platte, CR Rustic, on the bricks (and the bricks are coming very soon, I hear) we all are excited about the traffic we have already seen and hoping this fall we will have even more. That shop seems to change every few days. New old items are being brought in on a daily basis as there are 20 different dealers involved. Rob and Corey are doing a tremendous job with their latest creation of the shop downtown and I do know from experience how much time it takes to actually run a shop like this.


  We had a shop called “The Antique Place” if some of you folks might remember — it was located where the beautiful Swan’s Furniture store is today here in North Platte. We loved that store and I loved seeing the people drop in to browse or just to stop and have a cup of coffee with me and maybe a cookie if I had baked recently. Yes, they were actually home baked goodies part of the time — then I got too busy to even do that after awhile. But, awfully good memories of everyone stopping by to say, “Hi” and a quick walk through to see what we might have brought in. We started with four couples. We took turns working — and it was so much fun. Then, we stayed open seven days a week — and wow that was hard even though we were sharing working hours. But we still had fun along with the many hours of work. I miss it — and I guess that is why I am so excited about this beautiful shop opening right on main street in downtown North Platte. We will have many walk-ins that maybe they did not know the new/old antique shop was even there until the street gets opened up after the bricks are laid.


  Memories of other days, how they seem to creep into our thoughts in late evening hours. And that is one of my main reasons why I still enjoy writing my column for the Telegraph. I hope these bits of typed words thrown all together will bring back a few memories for you, as well. And, I hope that the photos will bring back even more memories of grandma and grandpa’s things and/or an aunt or uncle’s items that you may have seen in their homes throughout your childhood or maybe just recently. Our antique shops in town will help you relive those good times from your childhoods, and be a special place to bring your own young families to show them some of the things that you played with as a child or how we cooked back in your earlier days. It is such a mechanized world today that I truly believe we need to stop — take a few moments to realize and definitely appreciate how far we have come from the 1800s and early 1900s. Unbelievable when we look back how fast the time does seem to roll by us, and keep rolling along without a single moment of hesitation which would allow us to keep up with the changes all along.


  Time is something we cannot stop, but we can embrace it and move with it — even though sometimes it seems we have lost a few important things in our lives because we are on a “fast track” and cannot seem to slow down. But, by just taking a few moments to read this newspaper or sit with a cup of coffee in the early morning hours before you begin the hassle of the ordinary day, you too, will have a moment to remember yesterday and take just one more moment to be thankful we have another day to appreciate our families and our homes and our daily lives.


  Please take a moment today to think about the yesterdays you once knew and the extra special times spent with loved ones for holidays, birthdays and many other special moments. Sometimes just a cute 9-inch-by-14-inch metal tray with a melody portraying our younger years makes us realize how much time has passed and the world is still moving very fast. Stay safe and be careful out there, and don’t forget all the shops in our beloved North Platte. If you want to keep a hometown in business, then we need to patronize it as much as we can. Be safe and be careful. Hope to see you soon browsing our local stores. Have a good week, everyone!

Positano, Amalfi , Ravello un agosto da record , ma non fa testo in questa estate balorda per il Covid. Settembre miracolosamente tiene . Abbiamo visto che a Ravello in Costiera amalfitana danno i numeri, insomma fanno parametri su entrate, ingressi, tipo Villa Rufolo, turismo e cose varie, come se fosse un’estate normale.
 Questo agosto, a causa del coronavirus covid-19, è da record, a Positano forse sono raddoppiate le entrate per alcune attività, come i parcheggi o alcuni ristoranti, ma non basta a sopperire i problemi di questa estate dimezzata per molte categorie, tipo gli NCC. Insomma è davvero fuori luogo fare dei paragoni, un non sense, e questo vale per una parte e per l’altra , è un’estate anomala.
 La cosa buona è che molti dicevano che le attività sarebbero chiuse a fine agosto, invece settembre anche miracolosamente tiene. Alcuni chiuderanno a fine settembre, come Palazzo Avino, ma Santa Caterina ad Amalfi e il Caruso sempre a Ravello potrebbero ancora rimanere aperti, come pure a Positano.
 Il problema sono i lavoratori, visto questo super agosto si potrebbe almeno venire incontro a qualcuno di loro, molti hanno lavorato a turno, due mesi per uno , per esempio, altri non hanno lavorato proprio. Ed è questo il vero problema .
 Dunque gli italiani scelgono il mese di agosto per le vacanze. A causa della paura del coronavirus, in molti hanno scelto di posticipare il più possibile il momento per andare in vacanza attendendo un miglioramento delle condizioni epidemiologiche.
 La pandemia ha accentuato la tendenza, tutta nazionale, di concentrare le vacanze nel mese di agosto che, con ben 21,1 milioni gli italiani che lo hanno scelto, è di gran lunga il più gettonato dell’estate ma anche – sottolinea la Coldiretti – quello che fa segnare il calo minore (-11%) delle presenze dopo i crolli di giugno (-54%) e luglio (-23%).
 In ogni caso quest’anno il 93% ha deciso di restare dentro i confini nazionali – sottolinea la Coldiretti – con ben 1 italiano su 4 (25%) che ha scelto una destinazione vicino casa, all’interno della propria regione di residenza. La maggioranza degli italiani in viaggio – continua la Coldiretti – ha scelto di riaprire le seconde case o di alloggiare in quelle di parenti e amici o in affitto, ma nella classifica delle preferenze ci sono nell’ordine anche campeggi con i camper molto gettonati, mentre sono in sofferenza gli alberghi , ma non ad agosto.
 Poi anche le notizie di contagi dall’estero, la quarantena per chi viene dall’estero, fa ben sperare anche in settembre. Ma è tutto un flusso anomalo che il solo pensare di analizzare rapportandolo agli anni precedenti non ha senso ne logica.
 Speriamo bene nei nostri lavoratori, a voi Positanonews pensa, alle famiglie.

  OXFORD, Maine (AP) -- Most big events have been canceled this summer in Maine but the pandemic isn't stopping the Oxford 250.


   


  It's going to be different, though.


   


  Only 200 people are going to be allowed in the grandstands for the state's biggest summer stock car race on Sunday at the Oxford Plains Speedway, said race track owner Mike Mayberry. Others will be able to watch the race as a pay-for-view event, he said.


   


  It'll be the first Oxford 250 since the passing of former Oxford Plains Speedway and New Hampshire International Speedway owner Bob Bahre.


   


  Bahre, who passed away early on July 24 at age 93, created the Oxford 250 and was grand marshal of the 2019 Oxford 250. He made a final lap around the track in a hearse at his funeral on July 30.


   


  Under Baher, the Oxford 250 became a big event, and there's a dedicated following for the track's marquee event.


   


  Rain could be a factor in Saturday's races at Oxford Plains, but good conditions are expected for the marquee event.


   


  This year's event is expected to feature handful of former race winners, including three-time and defending winner Travis Benjamin, another three-time winner, Mike Rowe. They're both seeking to make history as the first four-time winner of the race.


   


  Others include two-time winners Eddie MacDonald and Ben Rowe and three others who've won once: 2018 winner Bubba Pollard, 2017 winner Curtis Gerry and 2002 race winner Scott Robbins.

  The coastguard said a patrol boat dispatched from the southern Italian island of Lampedusa had taken 49 of "those considered most vulnerable" among the 219 migrants onboard the migrant rescue boat, called Louise Michel.


  The rest were transferred onto another vessel, the German-flagged Sea-Watch 4.


  "Louise Michel no longer has guests on board, but the struggle of the survivors is not over," a Twitter account for the rescue ship wrote on Sunday.


  The Sea-Watch 4 now has about 350 people on board, including people saved in previous rescues, the ship said. Over two dozen of the migrants have been at sea for over three weeks.

  # 'Music helps us through all things': Metallica rocks virtual concert at drive-in theaters


  Patrick Ryan


  USA TODAY


  FARMINGDALE, N.Y. — Only in 2020 would you see Metallica at an abandoned amusement park.


  On Saturday night, the raging heavy-metal icons broadcasted a show to hundreds of drive-in and outdoor theaters across the U.S. and Canada, as part of the Encore Drive-In Nights series, which has also aired performances by country stars Blake Shelton and Garth Brooks this summer.


  We watched the concert special at Adventureland, a fairground-style Long Island staple that's temporarily closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Two small screens were erected in the park's expansive parking lot, where a shuttered roller coaster and Ferris wheel loomed overhead. Pint-sized train cars that normally circled the park now sat dormant, as dozens of people in Metallica T-shirts lined the train tracks waiting for restrooms. Occasionally, you'd walk by pictures of cartoon animals and superheroes peering through the darkness, giving the whole event a somewhat apocalyptic feel.


  The show itself was similarly surreal. Parking was staggered out so there was one parking space between you and your neighbor, and you could listen to the show through your FM radio or over the drive-in's faint, faraway speakers. Most people tailgated outside their vehicles, many with fold-up chairs and red Solo cups, while others opted to stand in empty parking spaces and nod along to the music.


  The majority of concertgoers didn't wear masks as they hovered by their cars, although everyone we saw maintained safe social distances. The vibe was fairly easygoing and subdued, save for a woman head-banging through her sunroof and people throwing "rock on" hand signs outside their car windows.


  Metallica, too, genially embraced the unusual nature of the show. They recorded their 1 ½-hour set two weeks ago on an empty stage with a picturesque mountain backdrop and flashing green lights. Throughout the concert, which was opened by hard-rock band Three Days Grace, Metallica frontman James Hetfield urged fans to honk their horns and put their phones up, which many people did eagerly and frequently.


  "It feels good to play again," Hetfield said, turning to his bandmates midway through the show. "We're not sure what everyone out there has been doing, but I know they've been listening to music and they've been praying and praying for something live they could grasp onto. Because music helps us through all things, including this."


  The 16-song set included popular Metallica hits including "Seek & Destroy," "Nothing Else Matters," "Fade to Black," "Master of Puppets" and "Enter Sandman," which closed out the night. The band brought fierce musicianship and high energy to the virtual show, which for obvious reasons, couldn't replicate the visceral experience of seeing live music. But like most other things during a global pandemic, you've gotta make do with what you have.

KILGORE — On June 30, Kilgore bar owner Tee Allen made national news when she helped start a lawsuit against Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) for closing bars.


  This week, she plans on filing a new lawsuit to help bars who cannot afford to have a kitchen in their establishment to stay open.


  On Saturday at the Machine Shed Bar and Grill, Allen invited the media to a press conference inside to explain the next steps. Allen said the bar would rather patrons not wear masks so they can be identified and checked for intoxication, but exceptions are made if someone wants to wear one.


  “TABC has once again changed the rules. Why change the rules again? Initially, they said you could not catch corona(virus) if you served food at a bar from a commercial kitchen, you have to get a food and beverage license and you have to pay $776 because ‘kingless’ Abbott has not stopped the fees on people who are jobless?” said Allen, whose name in the lawsuit is Tonia Allen Parker, though she goes by ‘Tee.’


  She said she is the co-owner of Machine Shed Bar and Grill.


  Allen talked about the original rule stating an establishment must have more than 51% of food sales to stay open, saying, “Because without eating a hot dog in a bar, you will catch corona(virus), so shut them down now.”


  She said 6,600 bars in Texas had to close and many have reopened by paying a $200 kitchen license fee and a $576 surcharge, but added that you also have to have or build a commercial kitchen, show the state proof and a menu. After all of that, the $776 is not refundable, she said.


  “The state collected the revenues and said, ‘Thank you.’” Then they came running back and said, ‘You need to close, you are selling 52 percent alcohol.’ No sir, I am not closing. I am going to keep working,” said Allen. “I know some bars that literally built a kitchen, one in Longview spent $10,000 to build a kitchen. But what about the bars who got denied or could not open a kitchen? You need to be fair to everyone or close us all across the board and give us a relief package.”


  Allen said the lawsuit is not about her bar, but the other bars that cannot afford to open. She also said the state law allows for loopholes to try to serve a few dishes off a grill from home, and she said that is not safe for patrons.


  So, let all bars open or close all of them and give them a relief package, she said.


  She said next Sunday the bar will hold a Trump rally at 1 p.m. and the main speaker will be Texas Republican Party Chairman Col. Allen West, along with others.


  Len Swanson of Houston, who said he is the founder of the People’s Alliance Against Tyranny and commander of the Veterans Militia, also talked to the press at the bar on Saturday.


  Swanson said after the lawsuit is filed on Tuesday, another press conference will take place.


  Swanson said using the “Freedom of Information Act, we have gotten (papers) from the governor’s office that will show he has done executive overreach. Everything about COVID-19 has been nothing but a social experiment to see how far Americans would be willing to relinquish their constitutional and civil rights.”


  He also feels the governor has benefited financially from the pandemic, but stopped short of details.


  “What they didn’t count on was Texans like myself saying ... ‘Really? Are you kidding me?’ What part of (BS) is still (BS) at the end of the day. I guess (BS) isn’t acceptable, so it’s BS,” said Swanson, who added Abbott went against the Republican Party by not allowing an in-person Republican National Convention in Texas. “The only reason we didn’t have an in-person convention is Abbott is in charge of Harris County, or the (former) party chairman, James Dickey, to do a virtual convention ... sabotage. Because it was based on us wanting an in-person convention only. We were denied that under state constitutional law.”


  Swanson explained, “I’m 67, I have a proper education. When we went to school, we had history, we had civics. We were taught to be good citizens. Our school system has been taken over by socialists. They are sheep holes at the end of the day and bow down and follow their new masters because they say so. This is not a pandemic.”


  Half of Swanson’s 12-minute press conference was hard to hear, as a profanity-laced song was played on the jukebox, which had been silent during the first part of his speech.


  Odessa bar owner Jami Burleson came to Kilgore for support along with Johnny Rice, known as the ‘Trumpeter for Trump.’ He blew a Biblical trumpet after leading a prayer at the press conference.
