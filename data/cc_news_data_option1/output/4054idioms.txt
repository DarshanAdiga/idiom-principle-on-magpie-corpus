The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes of California, revealed last month that Trump and his campaign aides might have been swept up in U.S. surveillance of foreign targets during the presidential election. What's more, he charged, the White House may have inappropriately asked intelligence agencies to reveal the identities of the Trump aides so that the Obama team could keep tabs on them.

I was disturbed that I lost my temper. I was afraid that my caste had been given away in the class. I was sure students would not interact with me about caste because they thought anything they said would 'offend' me. I hit myself on the head for letting an idiot get the better of me. But that's what caste does. My emotions rage all over. I'm unbelievably kind and stubbornly arrogant at the same time. My friend finds it very amusing. She tells me, "Divya, it's amazing how you can be so kind but hardly ever take credit for it. You brush it under the carpet and carry on with your sarcasm. You hardly ever say the words 'I love you'. But I feel your love all the time."

Once a student said "Ma'am, caste system doesn't exist. I have friends belonging to a lower caste and they've never told me about their caste or experiences." I smile. "Have you broached the topic of caste with them?" "How can I? If I do, then you'll say I'm being casteist for trying to know their caste with some ulterior motive!" I laugh so hard inside. Outside- deadpan face. "Two things, if you've never spoken about caste with them, how do you expect them to share their experiences with you? Secondly, how do you know their caste if they haven't told you?" The highly eloquent student squirms in the seat. "So, you never really know if you're casteist. Your intention doesn't matter. You'll always be branded a casteist." I stay quiet for him to understand what needs to be understood only through silence. Triggered, he continues- "Maybe you're also casteist. That's why you're talking about caste in a class that doesn't discriminate based on caste. Maybe you're talking for the Dalit while you're saying that the Dalits must be allowed to speak for themselves". The blood pressure level rises rapidly. "How are you sure I'm not Dalit?" I ask. "How are you sure I'm not Dalit?" he asks me. Voice is louder than expected as words come tumbling out "I know it for certain. If you want to know-how, meet me outside of the class because I don't want to disturb the class just to attend to your bruised ego." He never met me outside and I never could tell him how I knew. I knew because he was eloquent, intelligent, proud, confident, respected by his peers, and intentionally trying to intimidate young female teachers who didn't bow down to his superiority complex. Dalits come in many different shapes and sizes but we work towards each of these qualities with people insulting us throughout. It doesn't come as easily as it does for most Savarna people (mostly those who tell you that Brahmins are intellectually superior because it's in their genes and give you faulty statistics to prove their irrelevant point). The sexism is just the icing on the cake for this student.

I took my time to understand that. I remember deleting every message where I said "I love you" to her, immediately after she saw it. It was all in fun but why did I do that? What am I afraid of? I thought for a long time and realised I'm absolutely terrified of being loved. I realized I push people away because I think my family loving me is enough. Today, I see that I'm really afraid of being loved because I don't see why anyone should love me unless they have no choice but to love me (family). If someone doesn't 'have to' love me, they definitely won't. Because, once in a while, an idiot will remind me that if I lay my emotions bare, they will be used against me and I'll be pushed back into the dingy corner that I tried so hard to crawl out of. You are blinded by sudden light when you crawl out of dingy corners. You may go on to be a superstar but your fear of the dingy corner never leaves. Dalits carry this fear, either by living there or by remembering their ancestors lived there. At some point, our ancestors' experiences become our own. That's how I knew he wasn't Dalit.

Extending intra-day gains, equity benchmark Sensex surged over 300 points in the afternoon session on Friday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left benchmark rate unchanged but decided to maintain an accommodative stance.
 The central bank's Monetary Policy Commitee's decision implies rate cuts are possible in the future if the need arises to support the economy hit by the Covid-19 crisis.
 After announcement of the monetary policy review, the 30-share BSE index sustained and added to early gains to trade 303.63 points or 0.76 per cent higher at 40,486.30, and the NSE Nifty rose 77.35 points or 0.65 per cent to 11,911.95 in the afternoon session.
 L&T was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising around 3 per cent, followed by HDFC twins, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, ONGC and SBI.
 On the other hand, Nestle India, Asian Paints, Sun Pharma, UltraTech Cement, HUL and Bajaj Auto were among the laggards.
 Rate-sensitive banking and financial stocks were trading on a positive note, with BSE bankex and finance rising up to 1.77 per cent, while realty and auto indices were in the red.
 The policy review outcome was as per expectations, but it was the good commentary on GDP outlook and the liquidity measures announced that cheered the D-Street, said Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO of Samco Group.
 "All these proactive measures undertaken by the Indian central bank to revive growth and stimulate the economy will go down well with capital markets," he added.
 The benchmark repurchase (repo) rate has been left unchanged at 4 per cent, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said while announcing the MPC decisions.
 Consequently, the reverse repo rate will also continue to earn 3.35 per cent for banks for their deposits kept with RBI.
 Das said the Indian economy is entering into a decisive phase in the fight against coronavirus.
 He also stated that the contraction in economic growth witnessed in the April- June quarter of the fiscal is "behind us", adding that GDP was likely to turn positive at 0.5 per cent in the January-March quarter of the current financial year. PTI ANS RAM

LONDON (AP) — The British government is on Friday set to announce further support for firms to retain staff in the coming months if they are forced to close as a result of the imposition of further lockdown restrictions.
 With the government expected to tighten restrictions over the coming days to deal with a sharp spike in new coronavirus infections, there are growing concerns that the economy will suffer during the winter and that hundreds of thousands of jobs may be lost.
 Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said he understood how “people are worried about the coming winter months.”
 He is being urged by businesses, politicians and unions to accompany any lockdown restrictions with a financial support package to prevent mass unemployment. Specifically, he is being urged to back local job retention programs, whereby the government steps in to pay the lion’s share of the salaries of workers who are forced to go idle. A national program that has helped keep a lid on unemployment is due to stop at the end of October.
 “The Chancellor will be setting out the next stage of the Job Support Scheme later today that will protect jobs and provide a safety net for those businesses that may have to close in the coming weeks and months," a Treasury spokesman said.
 New figures released Friday show that the British economy's bounce back from recession slowed significantly in August. The Office for National Statistics said the economy expanded by only 2.1% in August from the month before. That was way down on the 6.4% expansion in July and substantially lower than the 4.6% anticipated in financial markets.

In contrast to Segun, Lawrence looks 25 despite only being 21. He is seriously mature, always seems to have time on the ball, runs fearless lines and is happy to mix it with anyone. Lawrence has the outside break if he needs to step on the throttle and can attack a soft inside shoulder while bowling a very heavy ball in contact. But what tops it all off is his fearlessness to take anyone on, no matter the scoreline, which I love. There is real mongrel and snarl to his game.

Can you catch corona through sex? Not when there’s a wall between you, you can’t, say experts from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. Their advice? “Use barriers, like walls (eg. glory holes), that allow for sexual contact but prevent close face-to-face contact.” (‘Glory holes’, for those who don’t want to have to explain their search history, are round, genitalia-sized openings cut into walls — typically toilet cubicles — to allow anonymous sexual encounters).

President Trump came into office promising big disruptive changes in the way America defined its role in the world. American foreign policy would no longer be aspirational — it would be transactional. "What's in it for us?" would guide the new "America First" approach. Human rights? Downgraded. America as an idea, a beacon of freedom to tired, huddled masses? Been there, done that. Promoting democratic values as a way to strengthen America's own economic and national security? Nope.
