Another 40-year-old QB lost. Josh McCown was forced into action in the first half as yet another Eagles starter, this time quarterback Carson Wentz (concussion) went down. McCown, who was retired when the season began, looked rusty and Philly flopped several times in the red zone.

Hoskins, Segura, Gregorius and Kingery will be the Phillies’ everyday infielders. But where will Segura and Kingery play? Segura has never appeared at third base, and he had the best season of his career while playing at second in 2016 with the D-backs (.867 OPS and 122 OPS+). Kingery has played third, but his best position is second. It is a conundrum that will be sorted out this spring. The early bet is that Segura opens at second. We have Harrison and Gosselin taking bench jobs, although predicting those roles at this point is a total crapshoot. But if Kingery is playing primarily third or second, Phillies manager Joe Girardi will want some versatility on the bench. Harrison has played second, third, short and both corner outfield spots. Gosselin, who led the Phillies with 10 pinch-hits last year, has played all infield spots as well as left and right fields.

Intel has unveiled the next tiny PC in its NUC line. The Intel NUC 9 Extreme Kit, or Ghost Canyon NUC, was announced at CES and sounds like a significant upgrade over its predecessor. It's a little bit larger than the router-sized NUC 8, but it's still ridiculously small for a gaming PC.
 One of the biggest differences between Ghost Canyon and its predecessor is that you're not limited by what you get in the box. It's powered by an i9 processor, but you'll be able to eventually upgrade the CPU. Its size also means it can fit a proper desktop GPU, adding yet more upgrade potential.
 Details are still pretty slim at the moment, but given that this is an enthusiast bit of kit, making it a bit more future-proof and moddable seems like the right way to go and a much better alternative to a desktop PC than the NUC 8. Normally you need to add your own storage and RAM, so it seems likely that will also be the case here.

Before New Year's Day, the Marlins completed their search for a veteran free- agent outfielder by coming to terms with Dickerson, who split time in 2019 with the Pirates and Phillies. Once Dickerson's two-year signing becomes official, he projects as the starting left fielder. Anderson’s '19 season was cut short in late August when he was hit by a pitch and fractured the fifth metacarpal bone in his left hand. With the addition of Villar, Anderson should again split time in right field and at third base. Last year, Anderson appeared in 67 games at third, compared to 55 in right. In his third big league season, he hit .261 with 20 home runs and 66 RBIs, and he was heating up at the time his season ended. It’s time to put up for Brinson, who will get his chance to prove himself in center field. But to secure a roster spot, he has to produce. Last year, Brinson batted .173 with no home runs in 75 games with the Marlins. He also split time in the Minors. Ramirez showed plenty of promise in 119 big league games, and he has played all three outfield spots. Left field makes the most sense for him. Sierra is out of options, so he either makes the club, gets traded or is cut loose. Berti, like Sierra, is a speed option and also can play the infield. Cooper provides the flexibility to play left and right field. Dean is an option to play left and first.

Like most of the roster, this really depends on how the hole at third base shapes up. If Josh Donaldson becomes a National -- and an everyday first baseman is signed -- look for Kendrick and Castro to rotate at second, with Cabrera mixed in as well. All this could change depending on how Spring Training goes for Kieboom, the Nationals’ top prospect. He could very well compete for the starting job, giving Kendrick more leeway to stay at first and Castro to take on a more utility role between second and third. Donaldson signing elsewhere may make Kieboom more likely to start on Opening Day if Castro has to shift to third and Kendrick begins the year at first. This is all fluid, to say the least.

None of which is to bemoan the arrival of pay ratios. Transparency is worthwhile and it’s possible that workers’ negotiating clout will be marginally enhanced in unionised workplaces. But remember: pay ratios emerged as a fudged compromise when Theresa May was lobbied out of her idea of putting workers on boards, or at least on pay committees. The compromise is one that firmly favours the current setup.
