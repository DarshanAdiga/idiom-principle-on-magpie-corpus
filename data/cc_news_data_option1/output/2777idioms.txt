Overall, this episode was Dark was a pretty basic and a standard show. None of the matches really stood out, because they continue to be predictable which is kind of an issue with me. If you keep the same guys on Dark every week, going up the same opponents every week, the matches start to get a little repetitive. I get the victories are added to their win-loss record, but are they really meaning something other than a statistic down the road? This is something AEW needs to work on. Looking at the previous episodes, it appears AEW continues to get some solid viewers for Dark. However, the show just feels like lackluster and unexciting, as random wrestlers come and go every week.

Municipal elections differ from county, state and congressional races in the sense that they are nonpartisan. Because candidates are not separated by party on the ballot, the number of candidates who advance to the general election is determined by the sheer number of votes.
 County Commissioner races are partisan and therefore look more like a standard primary election, with two candidates moving forward to the general election. But because two County Commission seats are open this year, the primary election will essentially determine the commissioner race.

It was so much better from the team right from the off against the Gunners and they now need to stay at that level over their remaining three games.
 Spurs don't have a bad end to the season with trips to Newcastle and Crystal Palace either side of Sunday's home game against Leicester City.
 A Europa League place is still not out of the question and the side may well have to record three successive victories if they are to play in Europe next season.
 It's so vital that Spurs start strongly in the north east and carry their momentum into the final couple of games.
