However, the second approach (which does not counter the first) evaluates the reasons why the current price environment presents a 'take profit' opportunity. It also highlights the jurisdictional risk in Mexico which is not a material risk (at present), in my view.
 Combining the two approaches, I believe it won't hurt to take profit on say, 10-15% of your MAG holding and then wait for the next dip when (and if) silver prices take the back seat for a while (and MAG prices follow suit). That said, I believe MAG is a promising 'long' investment that could deliver strong shareholder returns once the project becomes fully operational over the next 3-5 years.
