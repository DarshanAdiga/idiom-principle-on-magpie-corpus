The refusal to declare details of state aid has heightened EU suspicions that the UK would use state subsidies to make British goods more competitive. Meanwhile, a provision on standard-setting for goods being traded within the UK has created an uproar over a potential Westminster's "power grab". In a nutshell, the Bill overrides the post-Brexit powers over regulations and standards -- on food labelling and emissions, for example -- that would have devolved from Brussels to the administrations of Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. The Bill stipulates that the devolved administrations will still have to accept goods and services from all other parts of the UK even if they have set different standards locally. The government has explained that this too is to ensure seamless trading across the nation but it undermines local powers and raises the spectre of a post-Brexit constitutional crisis. The Bill, which is now before the House of Lords, suggests that the UK's post- Brexit problems have only just begun.",

TORONTO - Nearly one in four customers of the major credit-card companies were unable to make monthly payments this spring, according to a survey released on Thursday by J.D. Power.
 J.D. Power's May and June survey of more than 6,700 credit-cardholders also suggested that consumers whose income was dented during the pandemic were generally less satisfied with their credit-card companies.
 “While credit card issuers in Canada are faring somewhat better than their U.S. counterparts in averting the negative effects of COVID-19 on customer satisfaction, they are not out of the woods,” said John Cabell, director of banking and payments intelligence at J.D. Power, in a statement.

The Internal Market Bill, which British Prime Minister Boris Johnson managed to push through the House of Commons despite a split in his party, offers a potent demonstration of the problematic issues embedded in the UK's decision to leave the European Union (EU), its biggest trading partner. In introducing the Bill, the government admitted to violating key aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement and made it likely that the UK would leave the EU without a deal on January 1, 2021. This is the immediate repercussion of Mr Johnson's latest salvo. In the long run, it raises the spectre of a split within the UK and is also likely to diminish the country's global reputation as an upholder of international treaties, with the US expressing reservations about discussing a free-trade agreement.
