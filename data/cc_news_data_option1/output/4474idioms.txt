 Ryan Giggs is home alone after being arrested following a row with his girlfriend.
 The Wales manager was questioned on suspicion of actual bodily harm and assault following an alleged bust-up with Kate Greville, 36.
 He was released on bail pending further inquiries.
 Kate is now understood to be staying with relatives.
 Giggs, 46, denies the allegations but has stepped aside as the boss of Wales for the team’s next three games.
 A statement released on Giggs’ behalf said: “He denies all allegations of assault made against him. He is cooperating with the police and will continue to assist them with their ongoing investigation.”

 Today is the General Election.
 Monroe County residents will head to the polls and elect leaders to national, statewide and local offices in several highly-anticipated contested races.
 Several ballot issues regarding fire and safety protection, road repair and education funding are also set to be decided by individual communities.
 All polling locations opened at 7 a.m. and will close at 8 p.m.
 In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, poll workers and local clerks offices have been provided personal protective equipment and will be required to use it during the day, according to the Michigan Secretary of State.
 Voters are encouraged to wear a mask, but are not required to do so to vote in-person at their voting precinct.
 Due to reform passed by a voter ballot initiative in 2018, state residents who have not registered to vote but still would like to do so have the ability to register at their local clerk's office today. They must provide documentation of identity and proof of no fewer than 30 days of residency in the city or township where they are registering to vote.
 Officials across the state have reported higher-than-average absentee ballot voting, a result of voter reform, heightened interest in the election and concerns surrounding the pandemic.
 According to data from the state and local clerks, tens of thousands of absentee ballots were requested in Monroe County.
 To be counted, they must be returned to an individual's municipality office by 8 p.m. today. Each community's clerk's office has an absentee ballot return box.
 For those who lost an absentee ballot or did not receive one in the mail after requesting one, they can still vote at their precinct. Such voters will be required to sign a document at the polls, according to the Secretary of State's office.
 The Monroe News will track election results and update its website, mobile app and social media channels as those results become available. Subsequent coverage will appear in print in the days following the election.

LONDON (AP) -- A second lockdown in England is set to come into force this week. It's a big blow to businesses that sweeps away any hopes that the British economy might have recovered by the end of this year a large proportion of the near 25% drop endured in the spring. The economy is now expected to end the year around 12.5% smaller than when it started. The lockdown decision has cemented market expectations that the Bank of England will on Thursday increase its bond-buying program by at least 100 billion pounds ($130 billion) to keep a lid on borrowing rates in the markets.

“Kids are just naturally nice.”
 University of Wyoming product and current student teacher at Highland Park Elementary School Cheyenne Archuleta told me that a couple weeks ago, and I tend to agree.
 Folks often speak about childhood innocence and wonder, the honest mouths of babes and “kids say the darndest things,” (remember the show? Circa 1998-2000 and pre-criminal Bill Cosby).
 Archuleta naturally mentioned that in conversation with me about her students participating in the English and arts after-school program. Collaboratively, the Highland Park teachers are working with children — during precious after- school hours — to integrate social-emotional learning during a super tough time in our world. War continues in the background of COVID-19 concerns, a presidential election, social and racial unrest and a general unkind rhetoric.
 With the help of good examples at the helm — I’m looking at you, Highland’s after-school teachers — this group of 30-some students have transformed our Opinions page on a day where most people will feel a twinge of anxiety due to the outcome of a particular presidential race. In addition, I fully expect these golden-hearted children to also be impacting their friendships, relationships, home lives and, eventually, the world. Every teacher’s dream, right?
 Cheyenne explained to me when she first brought up the project of making homemade storybooks for patients sequestered in a nursing home during the pandemic, the students shot forward with ideas about how to make the best book, because only the best could do for the beloved senior citizens.
 She’s right. Kids are just naturally nice.
 Even parents subconsciously recognize that. It could be a bit that kids get away with cute stuff like homemade cards when adults don’t, but I can tell you the spreading of joy and kindness by my niece and nephew’s homemade cards sent like clockwork on every holiday through the mail inspires me to pay that kindness forward.
 So, thank you, Highland Park Elementary after-school students and teachers for transforming what is typically our most complained-about page in the newspaper into a ray of hope, kindness and joy.
 Let’s all learn a lesson from these children today. Instead of divisiveness, arguments and angry words, opt for camaraderie, discussions that involve speaking and listening and encouraging words. Text a friend that you’re thinking of them and you hope their day is bright and sunny. Call your mom back and don’t forget to thank her for what she’s done for you. Heck, take a page right out of the students’ book and make a homemade card to send to someone in the nursing home.
 Ease your anxiety by making time for exercise and time with the people you love. And while you await results from local and national elections, take a minute to read these letters of gratefulness from the minds of children.

Vivek, I don't believe that free market capitalist or people on political right are bad. My observation is that they are often more practical and hands on in their input to society and dare I even say in their effective ' progressivism and liberalism'. I find much about the left to be odious and too much whinging too...obvs the right has its share of negatives too. I think moral divisions between left and right are nonsensical. My issue is one of strategy...I think the right is in a super damaging doom loop whereby it views the national finances like a household budget (insane and highly restrictive and damaging!) and believes that cutting social costs (including low skilled labour costs) powers competitiveness (bonkers!).
 I do not believe there is any such things as a 'free market' nor has there ever really been one. The UK created the free market concept in 1800s as we know it as it suited its hegemonic position globally. Countries of means (US, Germany) did a China and undercut where they could...those without means were subjugated by someone. Obvs a super simplification.
