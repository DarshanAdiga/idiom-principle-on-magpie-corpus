Not all of my retirement savings are held within a pension, as I have also built up a stocks and shares ISA. In addition, I hold Index Linked National Savings Certificates and some cash. If you are setting up your portfolio from scratch when you retire, say with money transferred from an employer’s pension scheme, it is important to hold a cash sum equivalent to around two to three years of the retirement income you think you will require over and above your state pension and any other fixed pension. This will give your investments time to grow and a reserve to dip into if you need extra cash when market conditions are unfavourable, so you don’t need to sell investments during a market dip.

David Lee Roth has unveiled The Roth Project, an interactive graphic novel featuring five new solo songs.
 He has also released one of those songs, a breezy acoustic guitar-led composition titled _Somewhere Over the Rainbow Bar and Grill_ , as a standalone single. He posted the song on his social media pages with an original drawing and a written tribute to Eddie Van Halen, who died on October 6 at the age of 65.
 “Hey Ed I’m gonna miss ya. See you on the other side,” Roth wrote.
 You can listen to the song above.
 The five new tracks feature John 5 on guitar and bass, Gregg Bissonette on drums, Brett Tuggle on keyboards, and Luis Conte on percussion. Bissonette previously played with Roth from 1985-1992, appearing on _Eat 'Em and Smile_, _Skyscraper_ and _A Little Ain’t Enough_ , while Tuggle has assisted Roth on and off for decades.
 John 5, meanwhile, played with Roth on the _DLR Band_ record and tour in the late '90s before going on to find fame with Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie and as a solo artist.
 Over the past few years he has hinted at the fact that he had worked with Roth on new material, going as far as to play a clip of one of the songs from his phone during an interview with Masters of Shred last year.
 In that interview he recalled the circumstances of the recording.
 "So here’s what would happen,” John 5 said. “Dave would call me. He'd be like, 'Come on over. Let's write some songs, get some burritos.' And I would always hang out with Dave. For years and years and years. So I'd just go over and we'd just talk about everything and play music and write songs, you know, all the time.”
 John continued, "So there was this time where we would write songs early in the morning and then he would rent out the studio at night. So we'd write, write, write and then we'd go into a studio. And we did that for a long time. And we were recording and writing and recording and writing and we had a collection of music.”
 The new Roth songs were reportedly tracked at Henson Recording Studios in Hollywood. In addition to _Somewhere Over the Rainbow Bar and Grill_ they include _Giddy Up_ , _Alligator Pants_ , _Lo-Rez Sunset_ and _Manda Bala_.
 The Roth Project, meanwhile, is a 17-chapter interactive graphic novel featuring narration and illustrations from Roth himself, with animation from Colin Smith. Roth also composed the incidental music that accompanies the story.
 Viewers have the option to skip between chapters, zoom in and out of images, listen in 5.1 surround sound or stereo and to read the narrative as a standalone digital “paperback,” complete with an additional two hours of exclusive instrumental music not available in the illustrated version.
 To get the full scope of the functionality, check out the tutorial above.
 And you can read the full graphic novel at The Roth Project.

Cellular-connected laptops have been around for years, but they've largely been a niche category serving corporate road warriors. Then along came the coronavirus, which has changed, like so many other things, the way we've seen connectivity and how we all work. Pair that with a 5G network that's starting to mature, promising higher speeds and better coverage in the coming years, and the idea of a constantly connected MacBook Air or Pro sounds attractive.
 "Given that remote work is going to be a permanent fixture in enterprise in one way, shape or form, 5G notebooks could become an enterprise mainstay," IDC analyst Linn Huang said.
 Because Apple's chips are based on the Arm architecture of mobile processors that power all smartphones and tablets, they're already extremely comfortable with cellular radios. Specifically, these types of processors know how to balance the power management issues that come with a persistent cellular connection, so adding these radios is a snap.
 So why no 5G MacBook yet?
 This marks the first generation of Macs running on Apple silicon, and the company likely didn't want to take a flyer on relatively new technology since it had so many other fundamentals to take care of, like processor speed, app compatibility and power management. The hardware and feature set are identical to previous Macs, so Apple wasn't taking any chances.
 An Apple spokesman wasn't immediately available for comment.

BERLIN (AP) — Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's Cabinet on Wednesday agreed on a wide range of anti-terrorism measures meant to plug perceived security flaws identified after a deadly attack by an Islamic extremist in Vienna last week. The proposals include the ability to keep individuals convicted of terror offenses behind bars for life, electronic surveillance of people convicted of terror-related offenses upon release and criminalizing religiously motivated political extremism. Kurz said the measures, which will be brought before parliament in December for a vote, take a two-pronged approach, targeting both terror suspects and also the ideology that drives them. “We will create a criminal offense called ‘political Islam’ in order to be able to take action against those who are not terrorists themselves, but who create the breeding ground for them,\" Kurz tweeted after the Cabinet meeting. Four people were killed in the Nov. 2 attack, and the gunman also died. Twenty others, including a police officer, were wounded. Authorities in Austria have identified the attacker as 20-year-old Kujtim Fejzulai, a dual national of Austria and North Macedonia who had a previous conviction for trying to join the Islamic State group in Syria and had been given early release in December. An investigation has been launched into why Austria didn’t have Fejzulai under observation despite being tipped off by Slovakian authorities that he had tried to purchase ammunition at a shop in Bratislava in July. Included in the measures is a proposal to make it possible to strip people of Austrian citizenship if they are convicted of terror- related offenses. Austrian authorities have said they have been working closely with the FBI on the investigation, and U.S. Secretary of State...

By switching to its own chips and away from ones made by Intel, Apple will get more than the expected performance and power efficiency boost. It'll be able to more closely tune its software to work with its specialized chips, for example. And the company will also be able to manage manufacturing.
 "When you control your own destiny and control your own parts, you can save money," said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst at Technalysis Research.
 Generally, O'Donnell said, chip prices make up at least 20% of a laptop's costs. If Apple were to turn those savings into lower prices, it could attract new people who now just won't pay or can't afford the company's laptops, which start at $999.
 It may also spark consumer interest and spur competition from other PC makers, who've so far only toyed with using mobile-phone chips in computers (though with just under 7% market share in 2019, according to IDC).
 But the Apple credit card could be the company's true ace up its sleeve, analysts say. Putting Macs on a two-year, interest-free installment plan could get people hooked on the idea of buying a computer for about $42 a month.
 "Getting the Mac into a larger population could be huge," O'Donnell said.
 Regardless, Apple's move is bound to make waves, both by showing us how powerful its iPhone chips are, and potentially spurring the industry to change their devices to keep up.
 "This is the biggest announcement in 'computers' in a long time," tweeted Steven Sinofsky, a venture capitalist who oversaw Microsoft's Windows software division more than a decade ago. "The real impact is the direction this takes things."

HOUSTON (AP) — The Trump administration is trying to deport several women who allege they were mistreated by a Georgia gynecologist at an immigration detention center, according to their lawyers.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already deported six former patients who complained about Dr. Mahendra Amin, who has been accused of operating on migrant women without their consent or performing procedures that were medically unnecessary and potentially endangered their ability to have children. At least seven others at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, who had made allegations against the doctor have received word that they could soon be removed from the country, the lawyers said.Hours after one detained woman spoke to federal investigators, she said ICE told her that it had lifted a hold on her deportation and she faced “imminent” removal.Another woman was taken to a rural Georgia airport early Monday and told to sign deportation papers, only to be brought back to the facility as her lawyers sued in federal court.They allege Amin performed operations that caused or worsened their pain without explaining what he was doing or giving them an alternative. Their stories fit a broader pattern of allegations made by detained women against Amin, some of them revealed in interviews with attorneys and&nbsp;medical records reviewed by The Associated Press. But there hasn’t been evidence to support an initial claim that he performed a large number of hysterectomies.The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general also is investigating.Amin’s lawyer, Scott Grubman, has previously denied the doctor did anything wrong and called him a “highly respected physician who has dedicated his adult life to treating a high-risk, underserved population in rural Georgia.” Amin has stopped seeing women at Irwin County Detention Center.Immigrant advocates have urged federal investigators to examine not just the doctor but also the detention center and any role ICE had in sending patients to him.While people who have been deported might still be able to serve as witnesses in a criminal or civil case, many end up in unstable countries or situations where it becomes difficult to maintain contact with them. The deportations are occurring in the last weeks of President Donald Trump’s administration following his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.“ICE is destroying the evidence needed for this investigation,” said Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia University law professor who is working with several of the women.ICE said it had notified the Homeland Security inspector general “about any planned transfers or removals of Irwin detainees who were former patients of Dr. Amin.”“Any implication that ICE is attempting to impede the investigation by conducting removals of those being interviewed is completely false,” the agency said in a statement.The Justice Department declined to comment. Grubman declined to say whether the doctor had spoken to investigators.Mbeti Ndonga, 37, was taken to Amin last year after seeking treatment for abdominal pain and excessive vaginal bleeding. She said she wanted a new prescription to continue treatment ordered by a previous doctor. Instead, she said, Amin insisted she have a procedure known as dilation and curettage, in which tissue is removed from the uterus as a treatment for excessive bleeding. Her medical records show she was also given a laparoscopy, in which incisions are made in the abdomen.“He was adamant and said I must have surgery,” Ndonga told AP.When she awoke, she said Amin told her she would never be able to have children. It’s unclear whether that’s the case. She still suffers from bleeding and pain.Ndonga has spoken twice to government investigators, most recently on Tuesday. “I told them that I was abused, tortured, dehumanized,” she said.Within hours of her first interview last week, Ndonga and her lawyers say she was told ICE had lifted a hold on her deportation and she could be sent to Kenya at any time.“Mbeti’s fear in answering the investigators' questions was that it would make her immigration case worse,” Mukherjee said. “And within hours of the interview, her worst fears were realized.”Another woman was taken to see Amin in February after requesting estrogen patches to treat hot flashes, following a hysterectomy performed by another doctor in 2014. She asked to be identified only by her first name, Yanira, because she fears being targeted by criminals if deported to Mexico.Yanira said Amin told her he would perform a vaginal ultrasound and that she would need a Pap smear, a test for cancer in which a doctor collects cells from a woman’s cervix.Both procedures caused her intense pain. After the Pap smear, Yanira said she noticed there was no lubrication on the tools Amin had used. She had trouble sitting for nearly a week.“We are humans. We are women. We have feelings,” she said. “Just because we are detained doesn’t mean we should be treated like animals.”ICE didn’t respond to questions about the two women, who were brought to the U.S. as young children. Ndonga was previously deported after being arrested for interference with government property, then apprehended by ICE after reentering the country, Mukherjee said.Yanira entered immigration custody after being arrested for possession of less than a gram of cocaine or methamphetamine, criminal records show. Her attorneys notified the government Thursday that she wanted to talk to investigators about Amin. Early Monday, Yanira says she was driven to an airport to board a deportation flight. But another ICE agent approached to say she wouldn’t be deported because her lawyers had intervened.Grubman declined to comment, citing federal privacy law.ICE policy instructs agents to “exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis” regarding the deportation of “victims of crime, witnesses to crime, and individuals pursuing legitimate civil rights complaints.”The agency said this week that it was “accommodating the interviews” done by government investigators. It added that once a detained migrant has exhausted all appeals, “they remain subject to a final order of removal ... and that order must be carried out.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

 The Constitution, the economy and Trump’s legacy are secure
 Many Americans are tired of identity politics. President Trump did better with minorities than Bush, McCain or Romney. He doubled his support of four years ago. Trump’s populism, his helping minorities and blue collar workers, has resulted in a more robust Republican Party.
 The Senate races will save the day for Republicans in spite of the hundreds of millions of dollars donated to Democrat challengers by billionaires. It appears, pending runoffs in Georgia, that Republicans will still hold the majority. The Senate will block radical programs, like the Green New Deal and court packing. President Trump’s tax cuts and trade deals are safe. A President Biden can only increase regulations.
