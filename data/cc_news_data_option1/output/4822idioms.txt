Obviously, if the index moves the way you think it will, you want your trade to be profitable. But some trades react more favorably than others. Typically, a long vertical like the one just described would be expected to increase in price if it has fewer days to expiration. That’s because the long ATM put has high positive gamma, which manufactures negative deltas quickly if the index falls. And gamma is higher with fewer days to expiration, all things being equal. A long put vertical with more days to expiration would also likely increase in price if the index falls, but not as much. So, if you think the market might sell off quickly but possibly rebound, a long put vertical with fewer days to expiration could potentially capture higher profit than one with more days. That’s putting the power of positive gamma in your trade’s favor.  
 The downside? If you want to maintain a bearish position, you may need to roll a vertical with fewer days to expiration to one with more days, which incurs commissions and transaction costs. So, consider balancing the benefits of fewer days to expiration against the extra transaction costs from rolling by using an expiration that might have 30 to 60 days to expiration. A long put vertical in one of those expirations won’t respond as quickly as one that expires in five days, for example, but you won’t have to roll as frequently.  
 Now, if the index does have what you consider to be a big drop in a short time frame, consider taking smaller profits more quickly before the index bounces back. Don’t wait around to see if the index has another massive ’87-style crash. The risk, of course, is giving up potential profit if the index drops more. But if you believe the index might resume an inexorable grind higher, then it may make sense to take, say, 50% of the max potential profit of the long put vertical when you can. You’ll capture some profit (eliminating the risk of giving up all the profit) even if the index rallies back quickly and the trade turns into a loser. In other words, take the profit the market gives you, before it takes it away. And don’t be greedy. That’s putting the exit strategy in your trade’s favor.      Finally, keep your trade size small. Being a bear in a bull market can be a lesson on how to take losses. Don’t let them destroy your account by trading too big. That way, you can make sure the bull only steps on your bear’s paw, rather than squashes him. And, once in a while, you give the bear a chance to chase the bull around.

With Democrats now holding nearly two-to-one majorities in both chambers, the incoming House Speaker has publicly estimated the chances of lawmakers legalizing marijuana in 2021 at "50-50." Lawmakers have previously debated adult-use legalization measures in prior sessions, and Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has recently promoted the issue, acknowledging: “Right now, [Connecticut is] surrounded by states — New Jersey and Massachusetts — where marijuana is already legal. I don’t need a lot of people driving back and forth across the border. We’re trying to keep people close to home as best we can right now. I think legalizing marijuana — doing that safely and making sure that no poison is laced in — I think is one to keep people closer to home.”

Bloomberg) -- Japan’s government maintained its assessment of the economy in November, saying that conditions remain severe despite signs of improvement as the country faces fresh record numbers of virus cases.
 In its monthly report released Wednesday, the Cabinet Office used the same language to describe the overall state of the economy for a fifth straight month, but said it saw improvement in production. It lowered its assessment for capital expenditure.
 The assessment comes as Japan tentatively moves toward tighter restrictions in the face of record case numbers in major cities. Six months after the end of the country’s state of emergency, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is facing the tough task of trying to keep a lid on infections while aiding the recovery of the economy.
 Japan’s Record Covid Cases Stoke Economic Double-Dip Concern
 Production and exports have shown improvement in recent months, but other parts of the economy continue to lag. Prices haven’t risen for months even after excluding the impact from a nationwide campaign to subsidize hotel prices and spur domestic travel and consumption.
 To support Japan’s economy, Suga has already ordered a third extra budget, with one of his advisers expecting it to reach around 15 trillion yen in spending. But as cases spike in the U.S. and Europe, Japan also faces the possibility of another drop in growth.

Bloomberg) -- A Danish company planning to manufacture small modular reactors raised about 20 million euros ($24 million) to bring a floating nuclear-power station to southeast Asia.
 Seaborg Technology AS raised the funds to bring nuclear power at sea to parts of southeast Asia which rely on fossil fuels and where renewables aren’t yet an option. Floating reactors are as old as the nuclear age, with units powering submarines and icebreakers for some seven decades. Last year, Russia deployed new reactors on barges to light up remote Arctic coastlines.
 Seaborg envisions building its molten fluoride salt reactors in South Korean shipyards after developing the technology in Denmark in a bid to keep costs down. Completed barges will then be towed to where they’re needed. The plan is to connect the first unit to a grid by 2025.
 “We will provide a significantly cheaper alternative to coal in regions with no access to renewable energy,” said Troels Schonfeldt, chief executive officer of Seaborg. “We will provide a significantly cheaper alternative to coal.”
 Barges will be tugged to their final location where it can be anchored for as long as 24 years. Each barge can be outfitted with 200 to 600 megawatts of power capacity, depending on how many reactors are on board.
 The money, raised from mostly private investors including fashion billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, will be used to hire about 50 people and build a state of the art laboratory, Schonfeldt said.

 Is the stock you’re watching moving up or down? Who is doing the buying or selling? When is a good time to get into a trade? To answer these questions, technical traders typically use multiple indicators in combination. The theory is that individual indicators will provide false signals that could lead to poor entries and big losses. A more powerful system uses a combination of indicators to confirm one another. Traders stay out of potentially harmful trades more often if there are conflicting signals among indicators.
 Where to start? Try learning how volume and moving averages work together with price action, and then add or subtract indicators as you develop your own system.
 Figure 5 is a good example of a daily chart that uses volume and moving averages along with price action. It shows how a trader might determine support and resistance levels (gray lines). The volume indicator is below the chart; two moving averages (10-day and 30-day) are drawn over the candles inside the chart. Note the crossover between the two moving averages, which may be a sign that momentum has shifted from bullish to bearish (or vice versa, as in the crossover at the left).

BRUSSELS (AP) — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the first coronavirus vaccinations could happen by Christmas. She's appealing to the 27 EU member countries to urgently prepare logistical chains to handle the rollout of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses. She said Wednesday that “there’s finally light at the end of the tunnel." But she warned that millions of syringes must be readied, and cold chains, vaccination centers and trained personnel prepared. Brussels has agreements with six potential vaccine suppliers and is working on a seventh contract. The deals allow it to purchase over 800 million doses, more than the bloc's population of around 460 million people. Von der Leyen says, though, that this Christmas will be quiet.

Chandigarh (Punjab) [India], November 25 (ANI): Amid the grim Covid situation in Delhi-NCR and "apprehensions of the second wave" in Punjab, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday ordered a series of fresh restrictions in the state, including re-imposition of night curfew in all towns and cities from December 1.   The Punjab government has also doubled a fine for not wearing masks or following social distancing norms, according to an official release. As per the Union Health Ministry, Punjab has 6,834 active cases of COVID-19.   Night curfew will remain in force from 10 pm to 5 am, announced the Chief Minister, warning people against letting their guard down under any circumstances.   The curbs, which will be reviewed on December 15, also restrict opening timings of all hotels, restaurants and marriage palaces till 9.30 om.   Giving details of the new restrictions after a high-level state Covid review meeting, an official spokesperson of the Punjab government said fine for now following Covid appropriate behaviour will be hiked from the present Rs 500 to Rs 1000.   Given the in-flow of patients from Delhi for treatment in Punjab, it has also been decided to review and optimise the beds' availability in the state's private hospitals. The Chief Minister has asked Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan to work with the concerned departments to encourage more private hospitals to come on board and earmark beds for Covid care.   To further strengthen the availability of oxygen and ICU beds, Singh has ordered the strengthening of the L-II and L-III, with constant monitoring of districts that are not equipped with L-III facilities. The management practices in GMCHs and Civil Hospitals should also be examined in light of the recommendations of the report received from the expert group, he said.   He also directed the Health and Medical Education departments to make emergency appointments of specialists, super-specialists, nurses and paramedics, to further augment the manpower which was recently strengthened with the recruitment of 249 specialist doctors and 407 medical officers. The departments have also been asked to consider preparing fourth and fifth-year MBBS students as reserve and back-up, in case needed in the future.   On the testing front, the Chief Minister stressed the need to fully utilise the 25,500 daily RT-PCR testing capacity, and directed targeted and regular testing of potential super spreaders, including government officials. The district hospitals must have 24x7 testing available, and the same must also be made available at other convenient locations where people can easily access the same, he said.   To ensure that no deaths take place in home isolation, Singh said the agency hired to look into these cases should keep close tabs on such patients. "While mortality audit was ongoing, it was a matter of satisfaction that the Department was now collecting reasons for placing patients on ventilator by private hospitals, and there was a referral group available to monitor these patients," he added.

The story of Cutwater’s tequilas predates the Cutwater distillery itself… in 2014, Cherney was Head Brewer at Ballast Point but had a growing passion for distillation which he pursued in the brewery break room. Cherney also taught brewing classes at U.C. San Diego where he serendipitously met a bright, young student named Joaquin Lopez Orendain from Jalisco whose family has been producing tequila in Tequila for nearly a century. After learning about Yuseff’s dream of making a traditional tequila, Joaquin made an important introduction. When Cherney visited the Orendain’s family-owned and operated distillery, he was welcomed with open arms and open minds and a true one-of-a- kind partnership began.

The lever is one of those ‘5 Simple Machines" you learned about in grade school, that are designed to allow people to do more with less. The lever’s power was evident as far back as ancient Greece, if not earlier. “Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the Earth with it,” Greek mathematician and inventor Archimedes once said, as legend has it.
 Principles of leverage also apply to futures markets in the form of margin trading, which offers the potential to figuratively move mountains of commodities and financial instruments.
 What is futures margin, and what is a margin call? Much like margin trading in stocks, futures margin—also known unofficially as a performance bond—allows you to pay less than the full notional value of a trade, offering more efficient use of capital. Futures margin is simply leverage that can enhance returns; however, it can also exacerbate losses, which is why it’s important to use proper risk management.
 Here are a few basic questions and answers about futures margin: initial margin, maintentance margin, and the mechanics of a margin call.
 ## How Does Futures Margin Differ from Margin on Stocks?
 Margin trading in the equity markets means borrowing money from a broker to purchase stock—effectively, a loan from the brokerage firm.
 In futures markets, an investor or trader puts down a good faith deposit called the initial margin requirement, or “performance bond," as some exchanges call it. This ensures each party (buyer and seller) can meet their obligations as spelled out in the futures contract.
 Initial margin requirements vary by futures product and are typically a small percentage—2% to 12%—of the notional value of the contract. (Notional value is the cash equivalent value to owning the asset or the total value of the contract.) In contrast, with equity margin trading, an investor can only borrow up to 50% of the purchase price or total value of the trade (based on the Federal Reserve’s Regulation T, or “Reg T,” rule).
