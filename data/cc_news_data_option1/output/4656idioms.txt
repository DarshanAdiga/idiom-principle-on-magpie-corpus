The board probably made a savvy move by allowing the buyback of a million shares in early September when shares were still trading at $33, as the company might just have had insight into great operational improvements during the third quarter. By mid-October, shares rose towards the $40 mark, as the company guided for preliminary third-quarter sales of just over $59 million, with diluted earnings seen at $0.61 per share (midpoint). Furthermore, the company feels comfortable that it will meet its original 2020 sales guidance.
 Mid-November, the definitive third-quarter results brought some real comfort. Revenues came in at $59.7 million with net earnings reported at $23.9 million, resulting in $0.57 per share in diluted earnings. Net cash has risen to $234 million, or $4.50 per share if we conservatively use the diluted share count.
 The company maintained the 2020 guidance for sales of $192-$195 million. This is very comforting as it essentially implies quarterly sales of $61-$64 million, suggesting more growth on a sequential basis. This suggests that even if we focus on the diluted share count, earnings trend at around $2.25 per share, on top of the net cash position. Trading at $41 currently, operating assets trade around $35, for about a 15-16 times annualised earnings multiple.
 ## Concluding Remark
 Based on the analysis above, it shows that the unleveraged business trades around 15 times annualised earnings which looks quite attractive at this point here.
 Furthermore, these record revenue numbers in this kind of environment is very strong, as I would have expected much less demand in such an environment. With COVID-19 hospitalizations up in a big way, and people already feeling an economic impact, one might have expected less pent-up demand.
 All of this gives comfort as shares continue to look very cheap if this would be a "normal" stock or company for which we safely could assume this is a sustainable business in the long run, which is something to which I have some doubt. No doubt that earnings power of $2.25 per share would translate into a $50 per share valuation if that is the case, not even counting net cash, as it seems fair to say that more investors have some doubts on the inherent strength and longevity of this strength, given the multiples at which shares trade today.

And I think I'd jump in there as well. So I mean, we're trying to attack the expense ratio from both sides of the ratio. So to Harold's point, we're trying to reduce absolute expenses. It's been a continued thing we've been doing all along. If you look at our overall headcount, where we were at year-end, the headcount is down versus where we are year-to-date. We're obviously trying to retain the best and go forward relative to absolute expenses. But as Jim talked about, you also have to look at the denominator too and so earned premium. So we take a lot of faith in seeing us achieve appropriate scale. I mean, if you go back to it, you don't want to write premium for premium's sake, you just don't want to tar a bunch of premium out there, especially in a COVID world.

"I'm glad he's on our team," said Fairmont Senior coach Nick Bartic of Michael. "It's playoff time and you really get to see him do his thing and see how special he is as a competitor and how valuable he is to your team."
 Michael rushed for 211 yards and four touchdowns on just 10 carries and also completed 8-of-13 passes for 107 yards and three more touchdowns before ending his night at halftime with Fairmont Senior holding a 41-14 lead.
 "I don't think I've ever scored seven touchdowns in one half and it was great for the team to win in the first round obviously, but as an individual, I have to play way better," said Michael, who was still stewing over a pair of interceptions he threw. "Those two picks were awful. I have to have better decision making and just play way better."
 Michael's competitive standards will always lean him toward harsh critiques of himself rather than glowing praise, but for just about everyone else in attendance at East-West Stadium on Friday night, his performance was electrifying. He ripped off a pair of 60-plus-yard scoring runs that included a 65-yard sprint off right tackle on the very first play from scrimmage and then an unbelievable 72-yard cutback run in the second quarter in which he stiff armed one defender and pulled a spin move on another before breaking loose down the sideline.
 "We've been coming out the past couple of weeks just super flat almost and we haven't played up to the level that we've wanted, so coming out and making a play on the first play was big for us to set the tone," Michael said of the 65-yarder. "But probably my favorite one was the one over on the sideline where I cut it back and got a spin and a score — I don't know how it looked, but it felt pretty sweet."
 Michael also tallied additional TD runs that from three yards and one yard out, and he also tossed three scores that covered 12, 15 and 15 yards. And defensively, he nabbed an interception in the second quarter he returned 51 yards into the red zone.
 All told, Michael's 318 yards of total offense in the first half was the catalyst for a Fairmont Senior offense that rolled up 443 yards in the first half and 564 for the game.
 Yet in spite of the Polar Bears' two-way dynamism, Braxton County — a squad that more than showed it guts by even cracking the Class AA playoff field with just a 17-player roster — found a way to hang around in what was a marathon of a first quarter that ended with the Polar Bears holding a narrow 20-14 lead.
 The Eagles, led by the innovative quarterbacking of Jett Cogar, unearthed a couple of big plays downfield en route to one touchdown, with Tyler Cox first hauling in a 29-yard reception and then Cogar connecting with Baine Cogar for the touchdown on a 46-yard bomb. And they scavenged another score when Cox intercepted a pass Michael threw right to him in the flat and returned it 33 yards for a pick-six.
 Jett Cogar finished the game 12-of-27 for 185 yards with a TD and an INT. He also rushed for 58 yards and a pair of second-half TDs, and he plucked an interception off Michael in the second quarter. Baine Cogar, meanwhile, recorded game highs of five receptions and 122 receiving yards.
 "(Their offense) being able to run or pass kept us honest and that's always good prep to see fast receivers and a quarterback who can throw the ball, especially in the playoffs," Bartic said of the Eagles. "That's something that will ultimately benefit our secondary, because we've been playing run-heavy teams to end the regular season, so that was good to get a little bit of a feel for teams that can throw the ball."
 Fairmont Senior, which was already missing its top receiver and corner Kayson Nealy for the remainder of the season, was also without fellow wide receivers/cornerbacks Evan Dennison and Alex Brophy Friday night, casting usual backups into starting roles. Eventually, however, FSHS's spot starters found their footing, and overall, the Polar Bears limited the Eagles' offense to 126 yards on 28 plays (4.6 yds/play) in the first half as they pulled away with a 28-0 second quarter.
 "In terms of giving up the big play, that was the No. 1 thing we didn't want to do and we did that in the first quarter, and then we also turned it over in the first quarter," Bartic said. "(In the second quarter), I think we settled into the game on defense and were more sound, and then we also managed turnovers better."
 The 28-0 second quarter by the Polar Bears was capped off with a two-play scoring drive just before halftime. On the first of those two plays, FSHS burned Braxton County with a trick play double pass that saw wide receiver and backup quarterback Dominick Stingo connect with a wide open Jayden Cheriza for 35 yards, and then to finish the drive, Michael lofted a pass to Stingo in the back corner of the end zone for a 15-yard TD pass.
 Stingo finished the game with 35 yards passing, 28 yards rushing and 27 yards receiving, to go with a pair of touchdowns, while Cheriza led the Polar Bears with 72 receiving yards on three receptions. Kieshawn Cottingham caught another two passes for 31 yards, including a 15-yard TD catch, and rushed for 59 yards on six carries, and Zach Toothman rushed for 113 yards and a TD in the second half on just six carries.
 No. 6 Fairmont Senior 60, No. 11 Braxton County 34
 FSHS 20 28 12 0 — 60
 BCHS 14 0 6 14 — 34
 Records: Fairmont Senior (8-2), Braxton County (6-3)

The second thing is, we're filling a lot more sort of higher-margin products and particularly around protein. That's really favorable for us.

They brought this kind of mindset of hey we know how to win. Just follow what we are doing and we know how to win. With the combination of the coaches and having a quarterback. Obviously they have a bunch of talent on the team on both sides of the football. You see what has probably changed is the mindset of how they play and that's why they're having the success.

I would like to make a quick note on the cost of our funding. The average margin of our debt -- as you can show on the comment on the right part of the slide -- is about 3%. And assuming the LIBOR rate of 0.5% on the top of it, our cost of senior debt would be around 3.5%. If we include the cost of the dividend that we pay to our preferred equity, which we pay in kind with the option to pay in kind until January 2021, the other blended cost of our non- equity funding would have been around 5% as of the end of the last quarter.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a historic step and select a woman to head the Pentagon for the first time, shattering one of the few remaining barriers to women in the department and the presidential Cabinet.Michele Flournoy, a politically moderate Pentagon veteran, is regarded by U.S. officials and political insiders as a top choice for the position.Her selection would come on the heels of a tumultuous Pentagon period that has seen five men hold the top job under President Donald Trump. The most recent defense secretary to go was Mark Esper, who was fired by Trump on Monday after pushing back on issues including troop withdrawals and the use of the military to quell civilian unrest.If confirmed, Flournoy would face a future that is expected to involve shrinking Pentagon budgets and potential military involvement in the distribution of a coronavirus vaccine.Democrats have long sought to name a woman to the top post in a department that didn’t open all combat jobs to female service members until about five years ago. Flournoy had been the expected choice of Hillary Clinton if she had won the 2016 election. Her name surfaced early as a front-runner for Biden’s Cabinet, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.Seen as a steady hand who favors strong military cooperation abroad, Flournoy, 59, has served multiple times in the Pentagon, starting in the 1990s and most recently as the undersecretary of defense for policy from 2009 to 2012. She serves on the board of Booz Allen Hamilton, a defense contractor, which could raise concerns from some lawmakers. But her moderate views would likely ensure wide bipartisan support in a position that requires Senate confirmation.Few other names have been mentioned, though former Department of Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson was listed as a possible choice at one point. Choosing a woman would be consistent with Biden’s pledge to have a diverse Cabinet.She has been outspoken on American foreign and defense policy, particularly over the past year. She favors closer international cooperation after four years of a Trump White House that touted an “America First” policy and was more distrustful and critical of allies.“Whoever the next president is,” she said in March, “whether it’s a second Trump term or Vice President Biden or whoever it is, one of the top agenda items is going to try to, I think, repair some of that perception” that America may no longer be a reliable partner. “But I don’t think it’s going to be easy or happen overnight. I think it’s going to take a lot of work over a number of years to recover that trust and that standing.”She has also cautioned against drastic, immediate changes.“One of the most dangerous tendencies is for — after a change of administration, particularly when there’s a change of party — for the new team to come in and use the term ‘repudiation.’ But to come in and assume that everything their predecessors did was wrong, you know, they throw the baby out with the bathwater, basically, and they overcorrect in another direction,” she said in a Hudson Institute forum.Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine two-star general and former staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee under then-Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, said recently that he regards Flournoy as “incredibly well-qualified” to lead the Pentagon.The Defense Department is one of three Cabinet agencies — the others being Treasury and Veterans Affairs — that have never been led by a woman. Some of the 28 men who have held the top defense job since it was created in 1947, including three who served in Trump’s administration — Jim Mattis, Esper and current acting Secretary Christopher Miller — have been military veterans. Flournoy did not serve in the military.Like Mattis and Esper, Flournoy views China as the most significant long-term challenge to American predominance on the world stage. In July, she said the United States is losing its military technological advantage over key competitors like China and that reversing this trend must be the Pentagon’s top priority.She has, however, also warned against abandoning the Middle East and instead advocates “more modest levels of continuous presence” there. As an example, she has backed a limited role in Afghanistan that focuses more on countering the terror threat and less on rebuilding the country.“We want to reduce our commitment, but we want to do it in a way that’s smart and that safeguards our interests in the process,” she said in March about Afghanistan, adding that she hopes “we don’t just cut and run.” Trump has pushed for a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of the year, but so far the Pentagon has no orders to do that.On North Korea, she said in an October online forum that while nuclear disarmament should remain the ultimate goal, she finds it “hard to see” Kim Jong Un agreeing to give up all his nuclear weapons, which she said he sees as his regime’s “survival card.”On Iran, Flournoy has argued for a revised approach of deterring the Islamic Republic by breaking the familiar pattern of sending more American forces to the Gulf in response to Iranian provocations, as the Trump administration did in May 2019 after what it called credible threats to U.S. interests in the region.Flournoy is a co-founder of Westexec Advisors, a consulting firm that provides advice and geopolitical risk analysis to corporate clients. She works with a mixture of former senior government officials — including Antony Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state and currently Biden’s top foreign policy adviser — and military experts such as retired Army Gen. Vincent Brooks, who led U.S. forces in Korea until 2019.In 2007, Flournoy helped create a think tank, the Center for a New American Security.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

By Chapin Jewell   Tribune Correspondent   On Wednesday, Nov. 11, surrounded by family, coaches and other supporters, Frankfort's Hope Kiszka signed to continue her academic and athletic careers with the Acrobatics and Tumbling team at Fairmont State University.   In doing so, Kiszka will trade a Columbia Blue and Silver Falcon for a Falcon that's Maroon and White. Hope also will join her older brother Noah on the campus at Fairmont State, as Noah wrestles for the Fighting Falcons.   In her own words, Kiszka describes acrobatics as "involving a lot of skill and mental toughness in putting people up in the air."  She describes tumbling as "involving a lot of physical and mental ability to be able to do the flips."   Skill, mental toughness, physical and mental ability, Hope Kiszka has all of these traits in spades. Born with a limb difference, Kiszka explains that her "Lucky Fin" as she calls it, has been simultaneously a source of challenge but also inspiration and motivation.   "My limb difference has been a challenge to me in some ways. Sometimes if I tumble too much, my hand gets sore. If I do certain skills it hurts for a while. When I do certain stunts I have to rearrange the placements of my hand. My arm does motivate me. If I cannot do something (my mom hates when I say that), I get really down on myself," Hope explains.   "But, I will not stop pushing myself until it is achieved. I look at myself and I wonder how I even do the things I do. Knowing that I'll be the only limb difference participant in program history makes me feel very inspiring, but also I am just a regular person. I don't want people to look at me and think that, I want them to be proud of me for me, and my Lucky Fin," Kiszka explained.   A cheerleader and gymnast since childhood, Kiszka developed her skillset in the area of acrobatics and tumbling through countless hours of hard work and training over many years.   "I realized I could do this sport in college when my tumbling started to progress, and I was doing skills more easily then I was before," Hope stated.   In preparation for the rigors of college academia and athletics, Kiszka has made the most of her educational and athletic opportunities at Frankfort High School.   "Frankfort has prepared me for college academically by always making sure I have the grades I needed, or pushed me to the best of my ability. One teacher specifically who has always encouraged me is Mr. Cowgill," Kiszka stated.   Mr. Cowgill is Kenn Cowgill, history and government teacher at the Short Gap school.  Cowgill had these words to share about Kiszka, "Hope is a special young lady. When you think about the definition of student athlete, you will find Hope Kiszka. She is as dedicated in the classroom as she is on the floor. She always has a smile on her face."   According to Cowgill, "Above all else though, she is a wonderful and kind young lady who will have many successes in her sport, the classroom, and in life. It has truly been my pleasure to have her in the classroom."   "Frankfort cheerleading has prepared me for college athletically by always pushing me to do my skills, even when I am tired. I would not be where I am today if they didn't push me so hard," Hope explains.   According to Frankfort head cheerleading coach Lisa Moreland, "Hope has been a part of the FHS cheer squad for four years. She has also competed on our competition squad all four of those years. Hope has always displayed a strong work ethic and dedication to her sport. She is not only talented, but works hard to achieve new goals that she sets for herself.  Hope has an amazing drive and does not let anything get in the way of reaching her goals, including her limb difference."   "This has never held her back from tumbling, basing for stunts, or performing in any way. She has always done whatever it takes to be able to do the same skills as everyone on her team. Hope is a true inspiration for others and it is an honor to coach her. On a personal level, Hope has been my son's 'girl' for several years and has become part of our family," Moreland explained.   According to Moreland, "As someone who is fortunate enough to know Hope on this level, it is more than evident that she has a caring personality and is loved by everyone who meets her.  She has a huge heart and genuinely cares about the people in her life.  The A & T team at Fairmont State will be lucky to have Hope as part of their team."   In addition to the tremendous foundation she's received at Frankfort High School, both scholastically and in the sports arena, Kiszka cites her family, friends, boyfriend and his family as being her biggest supporters.   With tremendous individual determination and a history of hard work and dedication that has produced successful results in all she does, Kiszka's potential for accomplishment at the next level is limitless. She takes solace also in knowing she's chosen the right place to pursue her goals.   "I chose Fairmont State because it is not too far away from home. Also, I have a brother that attends the school as a student athlete, and I've heard such amazing things. I chose the Acro and Tumbling team because I have been doing gymnastics for so many years. What I liked most about Fairmont was how nice and helpful the coaches were when I had questions, and when I chose to sign," Hope explains.   Hope Kiszka is special. Special not because of her limb difference, though her ability to overcome the challenges it presents in her chosen sports of cheerleading and gymnastics most certainly serves as an inspiration to others. Hope Kiszka is special because she gives her all to everything she does with a smile on her face and a dedication second to none.   Fairmont State will soon find out just how special Hope Kiszka is. We've known it for years.

Well, this is Luc. Maybe I can try to answer your question. I would be very cautious to predict what the market is going to be in the long term. What I can see is that since late spring, we've seen quite a lot of stability in the market despite the strong domestic demand. As you know, the containerboard mill is now running flat out. And despite this, this hasn't created any specific pressure on the OCC market. Export outside of China has been also present in the last few weeks, but on the other side, generation has been very good. So we don't see, for the moment, any challenge with the OCC price.

READ:  Equities end at record highs on global cues post US Prez election (Roundup)
 The year ahead had plenty of hope and the fact that there seems to be so much of global liquidity available, makes one optimist about the upcoming times. We seem to have overcome the crisis from the pandemic and with half a dozen vaccines likely to hit the market, the possibility that things would improve dramatically is becoming more of a reality than ever before. With cost cutting across corporates and there being a concerted effort to cut costs, corporate performance is bound to improve. Money has ever been available at such cheap rates and with people having realised the benefit of borrowing only when necessary and having seen the Lehman crisis of 2008, it is unlikely that the event could be repeated.

And with this, I'm really absolutely changed the way we think about drug discovery in the future. And that's whenever I think about it as fascinating as nothing else that is out there, and you will see what our tech platforms really do to the drug discovery and development process and what we have already done in the last 10 years. And with this, it always brings me to the point that it's just the beginning of the Google-like vision to build a co- owned pipeline that is basically leveraged through the whole industry and which defines the shared economy of drug discovery and development in a completely new and a completely unique way. And having here 3,500 colleagues and the management team share that vision makes me totally excited to serve for Evotec, and that's why I do it.

We're replacing that business in France. But given the context in France, the social programs they have for companies over there, it's less of an impact.

Not surprisingly with his Steelers at 8-0, Mike Tomlin is lauded by Hall of Famer James Lofton and hall voter Rick Gosselin. Also intriguing is the support for Brian Flores and Matt Rhule.
 "Matt Rhule and Brian Flores are my favorites, and I probably would lean toward Flores simply for the rebuild he has had since he got there, and the tough decision he made to change quarterbacks two games ago when the Dolphins were winning," says Charean Williams of Pro Football Talk. "But Mike Tomlin will get my vote if the Steelers can remain undefeated. Sean McDermott also deserves strong consideration."
 COMEBACK PLAYER
 Roethlisberger, who went out in Game 2 last season with an elbow injury, receives lots of support. So does the feel-good story of a year in dire need of one.
 " Alex Smith, " notes Bob Glauber of Newsday, the president of the Professional Football Writers of America. "Based on football terms alone, it's Ben Roethlisberger, who has returned from elbow surgery to lead the only unbeaten team at the halfway mark. But in human terms, it's Smith by a mile. He could have left the game after suffering that gruesome leg injury in 2018, but overcame incredible odds to live out his dream and make it back."
 DEFENSIVE PLAYER
 One name dominates the sampling.
 "They should rename this award The Aaron Donald Award," Williams says. "He's the best defensive player in football. The Steelers have about four players worthy of consideration, but that's the problem: They have too many good players on that defense. I love watching T.J. Watt play, and Myles Garrett is having a good year for Cleveland in something of a comeback for him. But unless Donald gets hurt, I just don't see anybody overtaking him for this award."
 Watt and Garrett receive mild support behind the two-time winner of this award.
 OFFENSIVE PLAYER
 Some years the MVP winds up winning here, too. So Wilson, Mahomes, Brees and Aaron Rodgers get some attention. But Gosselin suggests Vikings running back Dalvin Cook, who despite missing a game while injured leads the league in rushing (858 yards) and touchdowns (12). Lofton likes Tennessee's hard-running Derrick Henry for the honor that went to New Orleans WR Michael Thomas in 2019.
 "You know he's coming," says Lofton of CBS Sports, "and there is little you can do to stop him."
 DEFENSIVE ROOKIE
 Clayton likes Washington DE Chase Young, the second overall draft pick from Ohio State, and expects a big second half from Young.
 Carucci goes for safety Antoine Winfield, Jr.
 "The main Bucs talking point is, of course, everything Tom Brady does and doesn't do," Carucci says. "But Winfield is performing in ways that undoubtedly make his father, who was an exceptional NFL defensive back for many years, very proud. At times, you think you're watching the old man all over again."
 Lofton and Glauber peg Baltimore's Patrick Queen.
 "A late first-round pick of the Ravens, Queen has turned into a tackling machine and a worthy linebacker to carry on the Ray Lewis tradition," Glauber says.
 OFFENSIVE ROOKIE
 Until Roethlisberger won this in 2004, no quarterback had ever been chosen. It's a semi-regular thing now, including Matt Ryan, Cam Newton and Dak Prescott.
 Through the halfway point, top overall draftee Joe Burrow of the Bengals and No. 6 selection Justin Herbert of the Chargers draw the mentions.
 " Joe Burrow has done wonders to make the Bengals relevant," Glauber says, "but Herbert's ascent is impressive. With 17 touchdown passes and just five interceptions on a team whose defense finds new and ever-more heartbreaking ways to lose games, it's Herbert who provides hope for the future."
 Not so, according to Clayton.
 "I'm leaning to Burrow over Herbert, but it's a close race," Clayton says. "Despite being on a team that has poor blocking and a bad defense, Burrow is completing 67% of his passes and has 11 touchdowns and 2,272 yards. But Herbert isn't too far behind. Burrow knew going into the season he was going to be the starter. Herbert didn't find out until close to the kickoff that he was going to play in Week 2.
 "I'd say it's a two-way race at the moment."
 With eight weeks to go.
