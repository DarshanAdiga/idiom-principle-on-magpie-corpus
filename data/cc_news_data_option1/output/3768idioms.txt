 Former Rover and bonafide fan of the club Gareth Ainsworth rolled into town dressed like he'd arrived late from a Hells Angels AGM looking to spring the renowned trap, but after a very shaky looking opening ten minutes the Rovers took charge and blew our guests from Buckinghamshire away.
 It was a ruthless display of direct attacking football and one that suited the personnel selected by Tony Mowbray down to a tee, with several of the younger Rovers alumni impressing along the way.
 It would be remiss to not mention that Wycombe were desperately poor - but how many times have we said that about the opposition in recent years only to surrender valuable points in inexplicable fashion?
 Tougher tests will absolutely come, but this was a nice little yardstick plunged firmly into the ground by Darragh Lenihan and his merry men.
 Adam Armstrong took home the match ball and the man of the match award, but there was a queue of teammates waiting patiently behind him for their share of valid acclaim.
 Tyrhys Dolan looks like a real find - if you're good enough you're old enough as they say,      He's a bag of tricks that comes WITH an actual purpose and his goal was just reward for a vibrant, eye-opening display.
 The young Mancunian got hold of the ball and went for the throat, meaning the away side were far more concerned with the damage Rovers could do than what harm they themselves could inflict. Fancy that!
 Stick your three most direct threats on the ball and tell them to go at it with reckless abandon and you cause problems for the other side? What is this sorcery?
 Lewis Travis' potential injury layoff is a blow, there is no escaping that but Bradley Johnson and Joe Rothwell did themselves no harm in their auditions to gatecrash the midfield three alongside, injury permitting, passable Stewart Downing impersonator Lewis Holtby.
