LONDON -- The pound rose against both the dollar and the euro on Monday, but futures data showed the market turned bearish on the British currency for the first time since December last year.


  Sterling was boosted by improving global risk appetite and hopes that lockdown measures may start to be eased as the number of coronavirus cases in Britain appears to slow.


  Britain is now seeing a downward trend in the number of people who are in hospital with the new coronavirus.


  Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who returned to work on Monday after recuperating from the virus, must now find a way to ease the lockdown without triggering a deadly wave.


  Against a broadly weaker dollar, the pound was up 0.2% at $1.2411, having touched weekly highs earlier in the day . Versus the euro, it rose around 0.1%, to last change hands at 87.34 pence.


  In Downing Street on Monday morning, Johnson gave no details of when or how the lockdown measures might ease, but said more would be announced in the coming days.


  Striking a cautious tone, he said that a second spike of the virus "would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster."


  The market turned bearish on the pound for the first time since December 2019, with negative bets on sterling outnumbering positive bets, according to weekly futures data for the week to April 21.


  That follows six weeks of investors reducing their sterling long positions.


  The pound's long-term prospects are hampered by risks relating to Brexit, which will come into focus again as soon as coronavirus lockdown measures start to ease.


  As trade talks between the European Union and Britain continue via teleconferencing, the British government maintains that it will not extend its transition period beyond the December 2020 deadline, even if a deal has not been reached.


  Unlike in 2019 when lawmakers were able to block a no-deal Brexit, Johnson's large parliamentary majority makes this a real possibility.


  "There is obviously a risk that Mr Johnson decides that actually Brexit now looks like small fry compared to what we're dealing with at the moment so is that not the best time to hold your position and say that you either get a deal struck before the end of this year or there's no deal," said George Buckley, chief European economist at Nomura.


  "The other way of thinking about it is to say, 'well if there's anything that is a reasonable reason to extend the Brexit negotiations then they should do it now because this is clearly one of them'," he said.


  Last week, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that discussions had made little progress. But British government minister Michael Gove said on Monday that the talks can still be concluded within the agreed timescale.

And pregnant women, who are usually immunocompromised but have high levels of estrogen and progesterone, tend to have mild courses of the disease.
 “So something about being a woman is protective, and something about pregnancy is protective, and that makes us think about hormones,” Ghandehari said.
 Some experts who study sex differences in immunity, however, warned that hormones may fail to be the magic bullet that some are hoping for; even elderly women with COVID-19 are outliving their male peers, and there is a drastic reduction in levels of hormones for women after menopause.
 The genesis of the estrogen trial at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island stemmed from a similar observation, said Dr. Sharon Nachman, the trial’s principal investigator, who credited a Stony Brook surgeon, Dr. Anthony Gasparis, with the idea.
 The trial enrolled its first patient this past week, and preliminary results could be available in a few months, she said.
 “It’s totally out of the box, which is how good ideas often start,” said Nachman, associate dean for research at the Renaissance School, which is part of the State University of New York.

Anxious thoughts are so powerful because they can cause you to act on imagined threats. Getting insecure thoughts out of your head and writing them down on paper can make them less powerful and help you to regain perspective. Additionally, following up by writing down the reasons you feel this way can help you to recognize that your concerns are unfounded. For example, if you've been feeling particularly concerned about your partner and his co-worker, write down your fears. Then, write down the reasons that you feel that way. It is usually at this point that you begin to realize that your concerns are less about anything that your partner or their colleague has done and more the result of internal issues.

In the video, the Enterprise responds to a distress signal on Talos IV, Captain Pike is originally going to ignore it without proof of survivors. He is obviously fatigued by a horrible incident during their last mission where he lost crew members, he even confides in the ship’s doctor that he is contemplating leaving star fleet. When survivors are confirmed, Pike directs the Enterprise to Talos IV where the landing party find a group of old men and one young woman as survivors. The woman we are told was born on their research ship right before the crash, making her about 18 years old, and her parents were both killed in the incident. As they make preparations to bring the survivors on board the doctor notes that the survivors all seem almost too healthy. The young woman, Vina, offers to show Pike how they are so healthy. She takes him to a cliff face where she then disappears along with the rest of the “survivors.” Three creatures with small bodies and huge, bald, veiny heads come out of a door in the rocks and render Pike unconscious taking him below. His crew responds but they can’t get through the door of the cave.

Imagine a major-college quarterback with a sizable social media following who posts entertaining and informative updates about his life on and off the field. Now imagine a restaurant hiring him as its pitchman and paying him $500 or $1,000 each time he posts content with its messaging. That scenario could become reality as soon as 2021 as the NCAA figures out the details of how college athletes can be compensated for the use of their name, image or likeness. Blake Lawrence crunched the numbers on earning potential for that imaginary quarterback based on the QB having 40,000 followers on Twitter and 50,000 on Instagram. The co-founder and CEO of athlete marketing platform Opendorse based his projection on a popular college athlete having a market value approximate to that of a retired, well-known pro athlete; active pros command higher fees. Lawrence said it would be reasonable to assume the quarterback would sign separate deals with 10 local businesses and post a total of 60 to 120 sponsored content messages a year on one of his social media accounts. “So quickly it’s $60,000 to $120,000 a year,” Lawrence said. “You can see how the math adds up pretty quick in terms of opportunities for high level student-athletes to earn a significant sum of money from activating their social and digital media presence on behalf of sponsors in the local community.” While autograph signing and public appearances have been traditional ways for professional athletes to make extra money, most opportunities now are tied to social media. The bridge between athlete and sponsor will likely be content delivery platforms — a cottage industry of sorts eager to link the two and cash in. And having those platform relationships in place will almost surely be a recruiting tool for...

I hate that I even have to say this, but the government shutting down the state to try to keep us safe and healthy isn’t a government overreach.
 Let’s be consistent. President Trump basically said he has total control of the country and people cheered. Those same people, if President Obama said the same thing, would do another round of Revolutionary War LARPing in Washington.
 (People forget that people dressed up as Revolutionary War soldiers to protest President Obama, but they did. President Trump isn’t the only president to get protested against and disagreed with, and I hope he’s not the last! America was, after all, founded on dissent and protest.)
 So how is trying to flatten the curve a government overreach? I think that when people are saying “government overreach,” they actually mean “inconvenience.”
 Basically, it’s whining.
 Yes, I’m upset. Several comic-cons I wanted to attend were cancelled, including a newish one in Pittsburgh that I hope doesn’t die permanently from this virus. Also, I have been waiting for “Star Trek: Discovery” Season 3, and it’s been delayed. All Marvel productions have ground to a halt, making me feel kind of desperate and panicky. But this whole thing isn’t a government overreach.
 I’m lucky. I get to work both of my jobs during this time. And if we’re being honest, I feel like teaching online is MORE work than what I have in the classroom, and it’s certainly not as much fun!
 But many of us have (socialist) programs like the stimulus checks and unemployment to get us by. Older people have (socialist) programs like Medicare and Social Security to help them out. Despite all that, some people are financially suffering, and businesses are crumbling. And I admit, I wish things were different.
 But I am not one who is willing to say that reopening the economy quickly is worth increasing the spread of the virus. And that’s not just because my asthma and weight would put me in the “Probably Dead” category if I get it. It’s also because I don’t know who else would get it. And what if those people are people I like? I’m not worried about rich people — they seem to have an odd ability to avoid it or recover very quickly. I’m worried about you and me.
 And who do we have to make those decisions for us? Who do we have who are paid (too much, actually) to take all the information they can get and consult with experts to do what’s best for us? Who do we have who are supposed to be trusted with representing the people and the people’s best interests? Elected government officials, of course.
 As much as we talk about us being a democracy, we’re really a constitutional republic. And that republic is run by representatives of the people. Now, yes, The Atlantic and other outlets ran several studies that if the representatives actually represented the people, the country would be radically different — marijuana would be legal, abortion would be easier to get in the first two trimesters and illegal in the third, etc. — but they are still elected to represent us, and since we’re locked into a two-party system, they’re the best we’ve got.
 And they’re doing what they’re elected to do. We have a global pandemic. They have access to information and experts we don’t. They are making the best decisions they can with the information they have right now.
 It’s not a government overreach. We’re just so used to our government not doing anything that it feels like one.
 And, for heaven’s sake, don’t inject disinfectant to get rid of the coronavirus!

  Such measures require a greater awareness among the Arab public about the necessity of using official financial systems and digital payment applications, to protect the health and safety of communities, he added.


  He made this statement during a press conference held remotely on the occasion of the annual Arab Financial Inclusion Day on 27th April, held this year under the slogan, "Towards Building Financial Literacy that promotes Financial Inclusion."


  "Arab Financial Inclusion Day has gained more importance, in light of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, around the world and its implications to the economies of countries, which requires cooperation among Arab countries to reinforce awareness about the necessity of using official financial systems, utilising digital payment systems, reducing dependency on cash, and avoiding physically going to financial institutions," Al Hamidy said.

DIAMOND: It evolved over time. First off, when Adam and I were spending a lot of time working on the book, I read a lot of music books and it seemed like they pretty much have this very similar formula of “I was walking down the street, one day, and I met this kid, and then this happened and that happened. Oh my god, everything was great. But now, we hate each other and fuck those guys.” So, with the book, we didn’t want to do something that everybody else had done. With [Adam] Yauch, and as a band, what we’ve always done is try to do something different. So then, when it came down to having the show, at first we were like, “Are we gonna go do readings from our book at bookstores, which is a normal thing?” But we wanted to do something that was different.

RICHMOND, Ky. (AP) — A candidate for a Kentucky state House seat has been charged with drunken driving and leaving the scene of an accident, police said. Monteia Mundy was arrested Saturday night in Madison County, according to news outlets that cited police records. Mundy is a Republican candidate for the 88th District House seat, which includes part of Fayette County. Mundy will face Republican Aaron Yates in the primary election in June. The seat is current held by Democrat Cherlynn Stevenson, who is running for re-election. Mundy is accused of being involved in a collision near a gas station. Her vehicle was found nearby in a ditch, news outlets reported. Witnesses told police that Mundy was driving on the wrong side of the road against oncoming traffic before crashing into the ditch, the Kentucky State Police citation said. A state trooper found Mundy incoherent in the driver's seat of the vehicle. She told the trooper someone hit her vehicle and she didn't know what happened, according to the citation. She also said she had been drinking at a friend's house, the trooper wrote. She was taken to the Madison County jail, but was later released on bond. Mundy said on her campaign social media pages that she couldn't immediately comment but would be releasing a statement “on recent personal events” in the next couple of days. “Please do not believe everything you read,” she said.

I lost it one day in the kitchen. My boyfriend found me there sobbing so heavily I couldn't speak. I was just. So. Lonely.

Norwegian art rockers Major Parkinson pay tribute to a month of solitude by releasing a reworked version of one of their popular 2010 song _Solitary Home_.


  The new version, _Solitary Home (The Hollywood Tapes)_ sees the band working with the Los Alamitos Sound FX, the most successful show choir in the United States, bringing the sound of a horde of California teenagers singing and dancing their way through a strange labyrinth of time changes and key signatures.


  " _Solitary Home_ has always been a very special song for us. It kind of reshaped the Major Parkinson thought universe and sent us down a different trajectory than we were on back in the day," says synthesiser player Lars C Bjørknes. "It's an absolute pleasure to be able to now send this revamped version of it into the world, where the song gets to show off a more flamboyant edge than the more intimate, sober original recording. Both versions have their strengths, but I gotta say it was so liberating to just go full American and throw caution to the wind on this one, there was simply no such thing as 'too much' working on this song.

With 1,854 Covid-19 cases and 103 deaths, Ahmedabad is the most affected district of Gujarat and has reported the second highest number of deaths. Jaykishan Sharma spoke to the city's municipal commissioner, Vijay Nehra, about the reasons for the spurt in cases and the strategy to contain the virus.What are the reasons behind the high number of Covid-19 cases in Ahmedabad?While we were aware that every effort must be made to contain the disease, we realize it will not be possible unless we do proactive discovery of cases and nip the infection spread in the bud. So, we adopted an intensive proactive discovery approach to find cases which we call the EPIC approach - enhanced testing, intensive surveillance, proactive detection and corona checkposts. As a corollary to this approach, it was all but natural that reported cases would go up. It must be appreciated it helped us in locating cases before they did large-scale damage through community spread. We have done 3,250-plus tests per million, more than double than the next highest figure in a city like Delhi, which has done around 1,500 tests per million. The doubling rate, which was three to four days, increased to seven to eight days. The recovery has improved. In the past, it was 5% and at present, the recovery rate is 10%.Any other reasons behind such a high number of cases?In the entire world, the problem has come to the cities first. In India also, Delhi, Mumbai, Indore, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and big cities with dense population were the first to be affected by Covid-19. As a quick early response, we effectively home quarantined almost 6,000 passengers who had come from Covid-19-prone nations. Of them, only 14 were found positive. But the cases increased after people in large numbers from Ahmedabad, who attended the [Tablighi Jamaat meet] in Delhi, came to Ahmedabad and were found positive.Maximum cases have been reported from the Walled City. Is there any specific strategy to deal with this?More than 800 medical teams are in the field for surveillance and as a result, we are able to catch super-spreaders like vegetable sellers, kirana owners and milk sellers on a daily basis through our intelligent sampling approach. On a scale never seen before in India, we sealed the old Walled City and in a single day, surveyed more than 100,000 people. We adopted a strategy of cluster containment early on and were able to moderate the growth of virus in hot spots like central Ahmedabad. Even at the cost of a rise in figures, we firmly believe aggressive testing and surveillance is the way forward. It might give an impression figures are rising in Ahmedabad, but it should be appreciated we are testing most aggressively. To complement our medicare efforts, we used the technology infrastructure that we had as part of Smart City Ahmedabad. We proactively monitor the lockdown in Ahmedabad through our 3,000-plus cameras in the city and in close coordination with police. Spitting fines and mask-wearing compliance is done through these cameras.What was the initial response of the administration to Covid-19 cases in Ahmedabad?Ahmedabad is a unique cosmopolitan city with a diverse multi-ethnic population. At the same time, it has diverse residential and habitation patterns which pose their own challenges regarding spread of the virus. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was alive to the Covid-19 challenge even before the first case cropped up in India. We were among one of the first urban civic bodies to suspend mass transport to avoid infection spread. We were the first civic body to launch a massive disinfection campaigns with support of our fire department.How are you tracking the people in home and institutional quarantine?Everything, right from daily essentials to medicines to special requirements, were supplied to the 6,000 home quarantined passengers by AMC staff and there was real-time monitoring of these people. We used GPS app-based location tracing of quarantined people to monitor their real-time locations. For those who were not home quarantined, we established a world-class facility in the Sports Club of Ahmedabad with every modern amenity and passengers were kept there free of cost. We are happy that the quality of quarantine ensured there was hardly any spread of infection from these passengers and we were ahead of the curve when it came to dealing with the disease. We established quarantine facilities in every zone of AMC to deal with Covid-19 in a decentralised and effective manner. We now have more than 10 quarantine centres in Ahmedabad either operational or ready to be put into operation.What were the steps taken to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities after the lockdown?Once the lockdown started, the biggest challenge was to ensure citizens don't face any hassles and have uninterrupted access to basic requirements of life. Immediately, AMC rolled out new initiatives, including door to door supply of vegetables and other essentials, collection of garbage of Covid-19 suspects such as bio-medical waste, free food and medicine delivery to elderly on demand, surveillance and fumigation through drones and disinfection through a wide range of mechanical vehicles. Hyper-marts were taken on board and door to door supplies of groceries is being done by them. Our e-rickshaw-based Vegetable on Wheels initiative was recognised by the Union government as a model to be replicated by all.How are you tackling the distribution of food in slums and areas having high concentration of workers?We tripled our citizen helplines and now address citizen complaints, including Covid-19-related ones, almost on a real-time basis. To ensure the person at the bottom of the pyramid doesn't suffer, AMC tied up with civil society members and we distributed around 50,000 food packets a day to the needy and no one in Ahmedabad slept hungry. Stranded migrant workers were provided with a roof and thousands were given a place to dwell. Similarly, to address the nutritional needs of people in slums, AMC supplied free vegetables and milk. We were one of the pioneers in social distancing and the ubiquitous circles outside shops were drawn very early on in Ahmedabad. AMC has enlisted more than 5,000 citizen volunteers through its online volunteer platform, who came forward to donate ration kits, food packets and sanitary material. Ahmedabadis came forward to sponsor tests for fellow citizens and hundreds of tests have been sponsored so far. With the support of Ahmedabadis, our strategy of aggressive testing is bearing fruit and we are hopeful that by May-end, we will be able to tide over this situation and this city will emerge victorious over Covid-19 sooner than later.

The Kerala government wants the lockdown, in place to check the spread of coronavirus disease, to be extended partially till May 15 and sought an exclusive Covid-19 financial relief from the Centre to compensate Rs 80,000 crore loss it suffered during the shutdown.


  The demand was conveyed by chief secretary Tom Jose, who represented the southern state, at the chief ministers' video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.


  The economic condition in the state is precariously poised and it wants the Centre's assistance to overcome the difficult situation, said chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan later in the evening. He said, in the last meeting with the PM, he had spoken in detail so this time the chief secretary attended the meeting and submitted the state's proposals in writing.


  "Our cumulative loss is over Rs 80,000 crore. Micro and small and medium enterprises alone lost over Rs 14,000 crore. Hotel, tourism, fisheries, IT, self-employment and other sectors also lost badly. So we want an exclusive package to revive these sectors," said the CM, adding the state has also asked the Centre to hike its borrowing capacity from the present 3% to 5%.


   


   


  The CM said 13 fresh cases were reported on Monday and two districts in green zones -- Kottayam and Idukki -- were put in the red zone as more cases were reported from there. Out of 13 new cases, Kottayam reported six and Idukki four. The state had reported 481 positive cases and 358 people were recovered, he said.


  Another issue raised at Monday's video conference was the return of immigrant workers from Middle-East countries, said the CM.


  "We want the Centre to bear the airfare of the people, as they are reeling under financial constraints. We will screen them thoroughly at airports and they will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine on their arrival," he said, adding more than 2, 20,000 were registered on the website of the non-resident Keralites affairs (Norka) department.


  There are at least 18 lakh people working in Gulf countries from the southern state and it is expecting that almost two lakh will be returning in the coming months.


  The CM said the state also sought the Centre's help in sending stranded migrant workers back to their states. There are at least four lakh migrant workers who are living in 10,000 camps in different parts of the state. He sought non-stop trains from the Railways for the stranded labour force.

Students also are continuing to independently lead letter-writing and petition campaigns to push their institutions to issue tuition and fee refunds. A student-run project at the Savannah College of Art and Design, or SCAD, asks the college to issue “fee reimbursement equivalent to the compromised nature of our undergraduate and graduate degrees,” said an April 11 letter from leaders of the movement, called A Choice SCAD. The students argue that some on-campus resources that spring quarter fees support are not being used and those fees should therefore be returned to them, according to the letter.

Once on board, Kirk discovers the Enterprise’s computer has locked them into their current heading and only Spock can keep them from reaching Talos IV. At a preliminary Court Martial hearing, Spock declares himself guilty and asks they move on to a full Court Martial trial. There being only two bridge officers on board they tell him they cannot comply – but Spock points out that Captain Pike is of rank and is still on active duty. They arrange the trial, and through some rhetorical trickery Spock is able to present as evidence perfectly rendered video of his mission to Talos IV with Captain Pike thirteen years earlier when he was a science officer on the Enterprise. The video, which is far beyond the quality of the records Star Fleet keeps – almost of television quality with swipes and zoom ins and everything DesiLu had to offer – is assumed a fake by Commodore Mendez. Captain Pike asserts that it’s all a real record of that past mission.

To my fellow classmates and myself this cancellation of school and spring sports is no vacation. It is wasted time in which we are missing out creating lifelong memories. In addition, the heartbreak of the possibility of not being able to walk across the stage of OHS’s auditorium and receive my hard-earned diploma in person with my own two hands remains incomprehensible. We are all trying to remain positive during this extremely difficult time but all I keep reflecting on is what I have learned from so many …


  My coaches, especially Coach (Dan) Brooks, who instilled hard work, leadership and perseverance (that has) formed me into the athlete I am today.


  My parents, who dedicated themselves to support me at every game home and away.


  The NYSPHSAA, which allowed me, as a sophomore, the opportunity to dream big, as the underdog, with a trip to the (New York State Final Four) in 2018.


  In addition, the Big 30 organization for teaching me the value of lifelong friendships of both teammates and competitors.


  When all is said and done, I sincerely hope the Class of 2020 comes out stronger, braver and kinder through all the valuable lessons we have learned.

The Kerala government wants the lockdown, in place to check the spread of coronavirus disease, to be extended partially till May 15 and sought an exclusive Covid-19 financial relief from the Centre to compensate Rs 80,000 crore loss it suffered during the shutdown.The demand was conveyed by chief secretary Tom Jose, who represented the southern state, at the chief ministers' video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.The economic condition in the state is precariously poised and it wants the Centre's assistance to overcome the difficult situation, said chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan later in the evening. He said, in the last meeting with the PM, he had spoken in detail so this time the chief secretary attended the meeting and submitted the state's proposals in writing."Our cumulative loss is over Rs 80,000 crore. Micro and small and medium enterprises alone lost over Rs 14,000 crore. Hotel, tourism, fisheries, IT, self-employment and other sectors also lost badly. So we want an exclusive package to revive these sectors," said the CM, adding the state has also asked the Centre to hike its borrowing capacity from the present 3% to 5%.The CM said 13 fresh cases were reported on Monday and two districts in green zones -- Kottayam and Idukki -- were put in the red zone as more cases were reported from there. Out of 13 new cases, Kottayam reported six and Idukki four. The state had reported 481 positive cases and 358 people were recovered, he said.Another issue raised at Monday's video conference was the return of immigrant workers from Middle-East countries, said the CM. "We want the Centre to bear the airfare of the people, as they are reeling under financial constraints. We will screen them thoroughly at airports and they will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine on their arrival," he said, adding more than 2, 20,000 were registered on the website of the non-resident Keralites affairs (Norka) department.There are at least 18 lakh people working in Gulf countries from the southern state and it is expecting that almost two lakh will be returning in the coming months. The CM said the state also sought the Centre's help in sending stranded migrant workers back to their states. There are at least four lakh migrant workers who are living in 10,000 camps in different parts of the state. He sought non-stop trains from the Railways for the stranded labour force.

  (ANSA) - TORINO, 27 APR - Alla Juventus dei 9 stranieri all'estero finora è rientrati soltanto Miralem Pjanic: il bosniaco già da una settimana ha ripreso gli allenamenti da Torino. Per gli altri giocatori bianconeri invece, non ci sarebbe ancora da precisa per il ritorno in Italia. La società non ha fissato un giorno preciso, anche perché sulla ripresa effettiva degli allenamenti in gruppo rimangono dubbi. Così Cristiano Ronaldo resta nella sua Madeira, Gonzalo Higuain in Argentina, Wojciech Szczęsny in Polonia, Sami Khedira in Germania, Alex Sandro, Danilo e Douglas Costa in Brasile e Adrien Rabiot in Francia. Per loro, poi, ci saranno ancora da aggiungere i 14 giorni da trascorrere in isolamento, una volta rientrati in Italia, esattamente come sono stati osservati dai colleghi dell'Inter quando sono atterrati a Milano. L'obiettivo al momento è quello di essere pronti per il 18 maggio, per la ripresa degli allenamenti agli ordini di Maurizio Sarri. (ANSA).

The second part of answering the question about catching health issues as soon as possible is that you shouldn't allow health problems to go unexamined. If you're dealing with medical symptoms that don't go away on their own in a reasonable amount of time or with at-home or over-the-counter treatment, don't ignore them. See a doctor.

The top four teams will win prize money, with the champions of each tournament scooping up $40,000. Teams will also earn $5,000 for every victory during the tournament. So far in 2020, teams have been playing for their season records. Games over the first three weekends of May will still count towards overall win-loss records. Actual tournament matches won't, but the top four squads in each region will earn bonus wins towards playoff qualification.The league is also suspending hero pools for the tournament weekend, so players will have access to all 32 characters. Matches will stick to the standard first-to-three-maps format, save for the finals, which will be first to four.With the move to a homestand format this year, in which teams were to play all matches at live events in their home cities, the Overwatch League ditched the format of previous years, which had three sets of mid-season playoffs with prize money and stage titles on the line. But after just a few weeks of homestands, the COVID-19 outbreak prompted the league to switch to online-only play for the rest of the season and drop plans for a $1.05 million mid-season tournament.The May tournament might revive interest among lapsed viewers, as it brings back week-to-week stakes. Viewership this season hasn't quite been hitting the heights of 2018 and 2019 after the Overwatch League moved from Twitch to YouTube. Concurrent viewers for a match on Sunday were around 22,000 at one point. Viewership was usually at least in the high five figures in 2018 and 2019."Our plan tentatively is to try to do more of this as we look at June and July," Overwatch League vice president Jon Spector said during a league broadcast on Sunday. "I think we could land on a pretty similar structure, then we start to head into the end-of-season playoffs and finals. We do want to do more of this, but we will also be monitoring feedback and making sure it's as awesome and fun as we think it is before we set a plan further out."

  "It won't be a complete washout," said meteorologist Matthew Cullen, "but with a series of systems coming through, there will be chances of rain every day throughout the rest of the week."


  A system that blew through overnight Sunday brought gusts of wind clocking about 40 miles per hour to places like Whidbey Island and Woodinville, Cullen said. Those winds will continue off and on Monday afternoon, though at greatly reduced velocity, bringing gusts up to 20 to 25 mph across the region, he said.


  All week, there will be some rain clouds and some chances for sun, with high temperatures in the lower 60s through Thursday, when it's expected to cool by a couple of degrees, he said.


  This meteorological variety pack could last into the weekend, according to the weather service.


  Basically, said Cullen, it looks like a typical spring week in Western Washington.

“La Difesa continuerà a garantire il necessario sostegno alla Sardegna per contrastare l’emergenza del coronavirus. Lo faremo con ogni risorsa, così come stiamo facendo sin dal primo giorno, mettendo in campo risorse umane, mezzi e infrastrutture per affrontare questo momento di grande criticità” – lo ha dichiarato il Sottosegretario alla Difesa, Giulio Calvisi (con delega alla Sanità Militare) nel corso dei vari incontri odierni con il Prefetto di Sassari, Maria Luisa D’Alessandro, l’onorevole Gavino Manca (PD), l’onorevole Mario Perantoni (M5s) e numerosi sindaci del nord Sardegna.     


  “Sin dai primi giorni dell’emergenza la Difesa svolge, su tutto il territorio nazionale, un ruolo fondamentale nella lotta al COVID-19. Oltre a garantire, in concorso con le forze di polizia, il rispetto delle norme per evitare la diffusione del contagio tra la popolazione, siamo quotidianamente impegnati in numerose attività che vanno dall’assistenza logistica per la distribuzione di materiale di protezione individuale, agli interventi legati alla sanità, con l’invio di nostri medici e infermieri nelle zone più colpite.


    In particolare, dal 20 marzo scorso, accogliendo la richiesta del Prefetto di Sassari, Maria Luisa D’Alessandro e dell’assessore regionale alla Sanità, Mario Nieddu, ho disposto l’invio di medici e infermieri militari per dare assistenza alle strutture sanitarie territoriali maggiormente coinvolte nel contrasto al coronavirus.      Negli ultimi trenta giorni i medici militari, dell'Aou e dell'Ats Sardegna, con il supporto della Brigata Sassari, hanno eseguito 2.063 tamponi per la diagnosi del coronavirus e 1.222 controlli clinici in 40 case di riposo nei comuni di Alghero, Anela, Bono, Bonorva, Chiaramonti, Codrongianos, Ittiri, Laerru, Osilo, Ossi, Ozieri, Platamona, Ploaghe, Porto Torres, Pozzomaggiore, Sassari, Siligo, Sorso, Torralba e Tula.      Questo team sanitario, formato da medici e infermieri dell’Esercito e della Marina Militare, opera quotidianamente in stretto coordinamento e a supporto dell'Unità di crisi locale del Nord Sardegna e del Centro di coordinamento dei soccorsi della Prefettura di Sassari. L’obiettivo è di assicurare il nostro supporto sanitario a 80 Residenze Sanitarie Assistenziali.      Da inizio emergenza, la Difesa, impiegando i velivoli dell’Esercito, dell’Aeronautica Militare e della Guardia Costiera, ha trasportato in Sardegna 460 quintali di materiali di protezione individuale, per la successiva distribuzione alla Protezione Civile Regionale.      Dal 26 marzo scorso, presso la base aerea di Decimomannu è operativo un elicottero HH-212 adibito per il trasporto aereo in bio-contenimento, attività svolta dell’Aeronautica Militare quale concorso alle operazioni di trasferimento per emergenza sanitaria.     


  Sono particolarmente grato a tutti i nostri militari per la professionalità, la generosità, lo spirito di sacrificio e la determinazione con cui stanno gestendo questa fase complessa e delicata, emergenza che potrà essere pienamente superata solo con il contributo di tutti gli italiani” – ha concluso Calvisi.

Of course, central bank financing of government expenditure is widely feared because of its historic association with hyperinflation. The fact that many governments have historically made considerable use of their central banks' lending capacity without generating significant inflation gets lost in the shouts of "Zimbabwe!" But this is the deepest slump since the 1930s. The hyperinflation risk is minimal. And if this crisis could once and for all lay to rest the notion that central banks providing governments with the money they need to finance exceptional expenditures in a deep slump is necessarily highly inflationary, that would be a good thing.
 Once restrictions have been lifted sufficiently for households to start spending again, central banks might want to consider doing direct cash transfers to households as well as financing government expenditures. Evidence from China is that consumer confidence remains low for some time after restrictions are lifted, and there is also evidence from several countries now that lockdowns may need to be reimposed. This adds up to a long-running demand slump, which could be relieved by direct cash transfers to households after the immediate emergency is over or in the gaps between successive lockdowns.
 But whether direct cash transfers are done now or later, the distribution mechanism needs a radical overhaul. The crisis has shown us just how difficult it is to get money to people. Governments have come up with a multitude of schemes, and yet people drop down the cracks between those schemes. The people who most desperately need money are also the most difficult to reach. And government policy can completely exclude some vulnerable groups, such as migrants.
 There is an urgent need for a universal payments mechanism that can deliver money to people and businesses fast and efficiently in a crisis. Welfare systems that deliberately create obstacles to obtaining money are incapable of doing this, and systems that deliver money to households rather than individuals are open to abuse. One solution might be to establish an unconditional universal basic income, not as crisis relief but as infrastructure.
