Pima Community College men's soccer players Martin Cardenas (Sabino HS) and Daniel Suazo (Tucson Magnet HS) signed their letters of intent to continue their education and collegiate careers at the four-year university level.
 Cardenas and Suazo, both starting defenders on the 2018 NJCAA Division I National Championship team, will play at Colorado State University-Pueblo, an NCAA Division II school in Pueblo, CO. The Thunderwolves are part of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference.
 Cardenas was named the NJCAA Region I, Division I Finals Game's Most Valuable Player when they beat Chandler-Gilbert Community College 1-0 in 2018.
 "Pima has given me memories I will not forget and I am beyond thankful for that," Cardenas said. "I'm excited to be committing to Colorado State University Pueblo to continue my academics and to see what's next in my soccer career."
 The Aztecs went 15-4-2 in 2019 and 26-2 in 2018 (combined 41-6-2) in Cardenas' two years with the Aztecs. The defense gave up less than a goal per game in both seasons. The Aztecs surrendered 17 goals total in 2018 (0.59 average) and 16 goals in 2019 (0.73 average). Cardenas scored four goals in his Pima career.
 Suazo played in 27 games and made 21 starts that season in 2018.
 In 2017 as a freshman, he helped the Aztecs earn third place at the NJCAA Division I National Tournament. That season he played in 23 games; making 15 starts. The Aztecs had a combined overall record of 45-7-3 with Suazo on the team.
 "Pima was amazing. I love every second of it," Suazo said. "All of the adversity helped me grow as a player and a person. I hope anyone that has a chance to join Pima takes full advantage of the opportunity.

Brandon Van Grack, one of the prosecutors from the former special counsel Robert Mueller's team who worked on the Flynn case, also withdrew as counsel for the government shortly before the DOJ filed its motion to drop the case.
 Van Grack's sudden withdrawal was the biggest red flag to DOJ veterans, who told Business Insider it was reminiscent of when the prosecutors working on the US's case against Roger Stone, another Trump ally, withdrew en masse after senior department leadership publicly reversed their sentencing recommendation in the case.
 The controversy kicked up another notch this week, when Mary McCord, the former acting assistant attorney general for national security who was directly involved in the Flynn case, wrote that the DOJ twisted her testimony to justify dropping the case.
 Jonathan Kravis, one of the prosecutors from the Stone case who left the department altogether after withdrawing, also wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that the DOJ's move to dismiss Flynn's case was a "disastrous mistake."

No one knows for sure. The Fed's broad efforts, which in a normal economy would likely accelerate inflation, may or may not be enough to keep prices from falling. Yet if consumers and businesses avoid spending at anything near normal levels for many more months in light of continued shutdowns, persistent unemployment and fears about the virus, a bout of deflation would become more likely. Most analysts have said they believe that sustained economic growth won't resume until sometime next year, perhaps after a vaccine or an effective drug therapy is available and can be widely distributed.

The COVID-19 outbreak has seriously reduced the mail load and, most crucially to the USPS, postage sales, its lifeblood. Without help, the quasi-government agency could run out of cash by October. And then all bets are off for what that could mean for service, particularly to the nation’s rural towns and villages where costs are high but revenue low.
 What’s been especially galling about the Trump administration’s posturing on post offices is the amount of misinformation that’s been spewed. For example, President Trump has said, repeatedly, that the USPS is losing billions of dollars because it gives too-low package delivery rates to Amazon whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, happens to own The Washington Post, a newspaper that has clearly gotten under his skin. A lot.
 Yet package service isn’t where the postal service loses its money. Indeed, package delivery is something of a profit center that has, in recent years, kept it afloat against a tide of a shrinking number of letters in this age of email. Indeed, federal law requires the USPS to recover costs from parcel shipping and, to this day, the Trump administration has failed to document that it hasn’t lived up to that law.
 But going after Bezos is only part of what motivates the president. The other half of the equation is that Trump and his fellow Republicans have long sought to privatize the mail and put the USPS on the same level as FedEx, UPS and others on the grounds that it would produce one or more leaner, more efficient (and less unionized) for-profit organizations. What they generally fail to mention is that, as studies have shown, it would also raise rates and reduce delivery service. It would also be bad news for the nation’s 600,000 postal workers.
 The bottom line is that this is a really horrible time to even be talking about postal reform. First, because putting mail delivery at risk when there’s already so much economic uncertainty thanks to the coronavirus pandemic is just foolhardy. Second, a political vendetta against one individual (no matter how deep and painful the perceived slight to his eminence in the Oval Office) isn’t sufficient grounds to upend one of this nation’s oldest institutions. And third, the amount of misinformation associated with this debacle is mind- numbing. It starts with parcel delivery rates but it often extends to mischaracterizations of the agency’s costly retiree health benefits obligation including the unusual mandate approved during the George W. Bush years to pre- fund them, a burden virtually unique among organizations of its kind.
 Reorganization? Reducing those expensive retirement benefits? Ending Saturday delivery? There are any number of reasonable steps Washington can take to make the USPS leaner and more efficient. But now is not the time when so much is riding on job growth and especially not with a proverbial gun aimed at the heads of all who depend on the mail. Toying with Bezos is one thing; threatening the nation’s economic recovery by withholding $10 billion Congress appropriated weeks ago is another. Americans actually like the current state of postal delivery, as a recent Pew Research Center poll found a whopping 91% approval rate, higher than any other federal agency (even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
 A president seeking reelection would be ill-advised to target the men and women in the blue-gray uniforms who are doing heroic work in difficult circumstances.

It’s not what most would picture for how a potential Major League Baseball draft pick would be training. Bohrofen is simply making the most of an unprecedented situation.
 The Westmoore senior is signed to play college baseball at OU but his plans could change this summer. Bohrofen checks in at No. 94 on MLB.com's 2020 draft prospect rankings and wouldn't be opposed to kickstarting his professional baseball career early under the right circumstances.
 If the draft doesn’t play in Bohrofen’s favor, he’s just as fine heading to Norman, playing alongside Braxton and following in the footsteps of their father, Brent, who played for the program from 1988-91.
 “We'll evaluate the situation if it's right with me and my family, it's definitely something I look forward to,” Bohrofen said of the draft, which doesn't have an official start date yet but expected to unfold this summer.
 “If it's not, I have no problem going to OU, playing with my friends and my brother, playing for the school my dad played for when he was in college and it's right down the road. So, it's a win-win situation with either option that I take.”
 While Bohrofen boasts two attractive options for his future, he would have liked a proper finish to his high school baseball career.
 He ended his time at Westmoore without much of a senior season. The Jaguars played four games — all victories — before their 2020 campaign met its demise. Westmoore was expected to compete for a state championship as it has since Bohrofen arrived on campus.
 Westmoore made Class 6A’s state championship game Bohrofen’s freshman and sophomore seasons, losing both times. They clinched a state tournament berth last season as well but fell in the quarterfinals.
 Those setbacks have fueled the player Bohrofen is today — a talented outfielder, who was a Perfect Game and Under Armour All-America selection last year and could be Westmoore’s highest-drafted position player ever if he's taken within the 2020 draft's five rounds.
 “That kind of just motivates me, personally, and I know motivates other guys on my team to work hard and never forget that feeling of what it felt like the year before,” said Bohrofen, who hit .479 to go with 66 RBIs and 12 home runs last year.

MEXICO CITY -- President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will lay out a roadmap on Wednesday for Mexico to re-open its economy, with a focus on the automotive sector whose supply chains are closely interwoven with U.S. carmakers.
 The U.S. government and automotive companies have called on Mexico to reopen factories serving the U.S. market, despite the Latin American nation still dealing with a rising number of infections from the coronavirus pandemic. Mexico on Tuesday registered 353 coronavirus deaths in its most lethal day yet.
 Mexico sends 80% of its exports to the U.S. and became the United States' biggest trade partner last year, with bilateral commerce worth over $600 billion.
 Lopez Obrador has been eager to get Mexico's businesses firing again amid forecasts the economy could contract by as much as 10% in 2020, plunging the country into its biggest recession in living memory.
 Lopez Obrador is set to discuss the reopening plans in his daily morning news conference.
 Paving the way for a wider economic reopening, the Mexican government's health committee on Tuesday announced plans to put key industries such as the automotive, mining and construction sectors into the "essential activities" bracket.
 It also outlined plans for Mexico's health ministry to allow for varying levels of economic, educational and social activities per state, to be defined on a weekly basis from June 1.
 Some automotive factories are due to open from May 18.
 "Governors are very much in agreement with allowing companies (in the automotive sector) to operate, because then all the money begins to circulate there," said one automotive industry source familiar with the re-opening plans.
 Mexican auto output fell by 99% in April, and the government is under pressure from the United States to synchronize its restart with U.S. companies that rely on Mexican supply chains.
 However, the reopening is likely to be gradual, said Phil Annese, a senior director at Pilot Freight Services which moves car parts for Ford, GM and FCA from Mexico to U.S. factories.
 The assembly plants "are going to start out at a 25% to 40% production rate, they're going to go as slow as they can to not create snags in the supply chain," Annese said.
 "If they get that supply chain stuck, that's more trouble than anything they can have. Starting and stopping lines, that's where the cost comes in."
 Mexico's government has been studying other countries that are emerging from lockdowns and believes that highly mechanized factories offer better conditions to control the risk of contagion, officials say.
 Lopez Obrador has sought to balance the trade off between limiting economic damage and saving lives but some lawmakers are unnerved at the speed that Mexico is moving to reopen businesses amid the rising death toll.
 That includes Benjamin Carrera, a lawmaker from Lopez Obrador's Morena party in the state congress of Chihuahua, where the industrial hub of Ciudad Juarez is located.
 He has urged authorities not to allow manufacturers to open any sooner than June 1 in Ciudad Juarez, where many maquiladoras, including auto parts makers, are located and 146 people have died of the coronavirus, including factory workers.
 "Juarez couldn't survive without the factories. But right now, the life of a worker is much more important than a job," he said.
 "A job can be recovered. People's lives can no longer be." (Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon, Anthony Esposito and Sharay Angulo in MEXICO CITY; Additional reporting by Nick Carey in DETROIT; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Christian Schmollinger)

According to a recent poll, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 56% of American adults struggle with sleep or eating problems, potential alcohol abuse, or worsened chronic conditions since the virus’ outbreak. And, each day, front-line health care workers endure emotional traumas often associated with soldiers in battle — levels of stress that we need to address if we are to properly honor and respect those who are serving us on the front lines.
 Here’s a glimpse at how serious this is now and how serious it could become. The Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute predicts that in Texas alone a 5 percentage point annual increase in the unemployment rate could result in 300 additional lives lost to suicide each year and 425 additional lives lost to drug overdoses.
 For example, suicide is already the 11th leading cause of death in Texas and the fourth leading cause of death for Texans ages 35-44. On average, one person dies by suicide every two hours in the state, and, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more Texans die by suicide than by alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents.
 As shocking as the Texas statistics are, Meadows estimates that nationwide the impact of coronavirus-related stress will result in 4,000 more suicides and 4,800 overdose deaths. Those estimates would skyrocket to 18,000 more suicides and more than 22,000 additional drug overdoses annually if the economic recession approaches the scale of the Great Depression, Meadows notes.
 This issue is beginning to get attention. Last week, Texas Sen. John Cornyn urged lawmakers to provide better funding, noting that “resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment providers cannot fall by the wayside.” Just days earlier a coalition of mental health service organizations asked federal officials for at least $40 billion to support their operations now and warned they could require more assistance if the demand for mental health services spikes upward as expected.
 We’re not ones to lightly advocate more money as the solution to every problem. But the answer to this problem is a mix of new dollars and changes to allow more innovative delivery of mental health services to those in need. Although Congress authorized trillions of dollars in several rounds of emergency coronavirus funding for a variety of needs, that assistance hasn’t adequately addressed the long- or short-term mental health challenges we now face.
 Finding innovative ways for service providers to expand their capacity to treat patients is essential, starting with widespread mental health screenings, better access to services through telemedicine, and multiyear state and federal commitments toward treating mental disorders.
 As a nation, we must be prepared for the mental health pandemic that will follow the coronavirus pandemic.

 A win by Day would represent a pickup of one seat by Democrats in the Nebraska Legislature.
 But the primary also points to the possibility that Republicans could win back two open districts, where Democratic incumbents are term-limited. In both districts, Republican candidates were leading in the polls against Democratic opponents.
 The Legislature is nonpartisan, meaning senators appear on the ballot and serve without regard to party affiliation. However, party affiliation often plays a major part in the campaigns.

A third NRL player on the camping trip, Newcastle Knights' Tyronne Roberts- Davis, was fined AUS$4,000, with AUS$6,000 suspended, by the NRL and AUS$1,000 by police.
 The players posted pictures and videos of the trip on social media, including one picture which showed them among a group of 12 men gathered by a campfire.
 Addo-Carr publicly apologised last month for the camping trip and said it had been organised to help a relative cope with a personal problem and reconnect with traditional Aboriginal culture.
 A fourth NRL player, Penrith Panthers halfback Nathan Cleary, was fined AUS$4,000, with AUS$6,000 suspended, last month for breaching public health orders by hosting a group of women at his home.
 Cleary's sanction was hiked to a two-match ban this week and a AUS$30,000 fine after the NRL found he had been "untruthful" about his account of the breach.
 The relatively light sanction given initially to Cleary, who is white, led to accusations of double-standards, prompting NRL Chief Executive Andrew Abdo to tell local media the difference in the fines had "nothing to do with culture or race".
 Tabchouri said Addo-Carr's fine was disproportionate.
 "Parity-wise, even if (Addo-Carr) were guilty, Nathan Cleary was fined AUS$10,000," he said.
 "We’re fined AUS$50,000, the maximum penalty available. They’ve categorised this (breach) as the worst case scenario. And that can’t be the worst case scenario."
 Tabchouri said Addo-Carr had made a submission to the NRL's integrity unit and was waiting for their response.
 He said the 24-year-old was also considering contesting the police fine and would decide soon whether to pursue it.
 The NRL has yet to respond to a Reuters request for comment.
 The season was suspended after two rounds in March due to the coronavirus but is scheduled to restart with matches at closed stadiums from May 28.
 Addo-Carr and Mitchell are also facing police charges related to firearms offences which were brought after video posted on social media showed Addo- Carr using a gun during the camping trip. The pair are to appear in court in August.

Bloomberg) -- Mexico's energy ministry is seeking to prioritize state-run utilities over new entrants to support supply stability, according to a draft proposal seen by Bloomberg News, a step that could place restrictions on expanding the country's renewable power capacity.
 The plan is the latest among moves by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's administration to reduce private sector generation, which have been criticized for stifling development of green power. A ministry spokesperson didn't respond to requests for comment outside normal business hours.
 Under the proposal, the energy ministry would impose a number of tests and limitations on new solar and wind projects, including congestion studies, according to the documents. It would also give the National Center for Energy Control, known as Cenace, the power to reject new plant study requests and prioritize state-run utility Comision Federal de Electricidad.
 "This policy will contribute to the reliability, safety, continuity and quality of the National Electric System," the ministry said in the document. It will provide for "the orderly increase in generation with intermittent clean energy, connected and not connected to the National Electrical System, supervised by the state, through the Energy Ministry."
 Mexico's president, widely known as AMLO, has come under fire for favoring the nation's state-run companies at the expense of new competition and dialing back energy reforms from the previous center-right administration. Earlier this month, Cenace indefinitely suspended critical tests for new clean-energy projects, leading to a rebuke by the nation's antitrust regulator.
 A draft proposal by the Federal Electricity Commission leaked in December aimed to increase transmission costs for private companies and give the CFE preference over private generation when electricity is dispatched into the national grid.

WASHINGTON -- Over 300 lawmakers from around the world on Wednesday urged the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to cancel the debt of the poorest countries in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and to boost funding to avert a global economic meltdown.
 The initiative, led by former U.S. presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Ilham Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, comes amid growing concern that developing countries and emerging economies will be devastated by the pandemic.
 The virus has infected more than 4.2 million people globally and killed 287,349, a Reuters tally showed.
 Widespread shutdowns aimed at containing the virus are taking a huge toll on the global economy, and especially poor countries with weak health systems, high debt levels and few resources to manage the dual health and economic crises.
 IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday said the Fund was "very likely" to revise downward its forecast that global output would shrink by 3% in 2020, and said developing countries would need more than $2.5 trillion in financing to weather the storm.
 Sanders said poor countries needed every cent to care for their people, instead of servicing the "unsustainable debts" they owe to the large international financial institutions.
 Canceling the debt of the poorest countries was "the very least that the World Bank, IMF and other international financial institutions should do to prevent an unimaginable increase in poverty, hunger, and disease that threatens hundreds of millions of people," he said.
 The lawmakers welcomed a move by the IMF to cover the debt service payments of 25 of the poorest countries for six months, but said further efforts were needed.
 The World Bank has said it will look at ways to expand its support for the poorest countries, but warned waiving debt payments could harm its credit rating and undercut its ability to provide low-cost funding to members.
 In the letter, parliamentarians from two dozen countries on all six continents, said debt service obligations of the poorest countries should be canceled outright, instead of simply suspended, as agreed by the Group of 20 countries in April.
 Failing to do so meant those countries would not be able to prioritize spending needed to fight the virus, which in turn could lead to continued disruption to global supply chains and financial markets, they wrote.
 The lawmakers also urged the IMF's Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass to support creation of trillions of dollars of new Special Drawing Rights, the currency of the IMF.
 "An issuance of SDRs on the order of trillions of dollars will be required to avert major increases in poverty, hunger and disease," wrote the lawmakers, who span a wide range of political affiliations and include former heads of state.
 An SDR allocation is akin to a central bank "printing" new money and does not trigger big costs, but has been opposed by the United States, the IMF's largest shareholder.
 Omar said the United States should lead the effort to provide relief to the most vulnerable nations.
 "All our destinies are linked. If we turn a blind eye to the suffering of people abroad, it will eventually harm us," Omar said.
 Other signatories include former British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Argentine lawmaker Carlos Menem, who enacted austerity measures when he served as president in the 1980s and 1990s. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)

 ## “Disastrous effect on quality of care”
 Owing to stress, an unbalanced shift system and pay rates found to be too low, one in two health-care workers has expressed a desire to change careers before retirement age. This is the finding of a 2019 opinion survey by the trade union Unia. Every year, 2,400 nurses quit the profession.
 This is an “alarming” situation caused by the growing predominance of economic considerations in the way healthcare work is organised, the union said. “In the name of profitability there is rationalisation, costs are cut, there are budget cuts, and at the same time, the disastrous effects of this on working conditions and the quality of care are studiously ignored,” says Yvonne Peist- Gaillet of Unia.
