It's also the first time Oakland advanced past the first round of the postseason since 2006. The No. 2 seed A's will face the division rival and No. 6 seed Houston Astros in the ALDS. The A's dominated the Astros in the regular season, finishing 7-3 with the AL West title.
 After the White Sox jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the third, the A's answered with four runs in the fourth inning. Chicago tied the game back up in the fifth inning, but Chad Pinder hit the go ahead two-run single with two outs in the fifth. Pinder's RBI single was the first run-scoring postseason hit by any A's batter with runners in scoring position since the 2014 AL Wild Card Game.
