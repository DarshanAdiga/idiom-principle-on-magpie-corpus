REXBURG — Isaac Payne loved doing martial arts as a child — so much so that as an adult he created his own gym, Payne Athletic Company. The business is located at 19th North and 12th West in Rexburg, right behind Mother Hibbard’s Country Store.
 “When I got into martial arts as a kid, it was a way to stay active," Payne said. "As I got older, martial arts was very applicable with law enforcement and military. I love teaching people how to take care of themselves and protect themselves."
 During the day, Payne works as the Madison County Sheriff’s Office public information officer. He has worked for the Sheriff’s Office on and off since 2004. After work, Payne heads over to his martial arts facility that he runs with his wife of 15 years, Amanda Payne, who does the business’s books.

White, who said he made the video, said that before the gunfire, he looked out his window and saw six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk. A few moments later, Blake drove up in his SUV and told his son, who was standing nearby, to get in the vehicle, according to White. White said Blake did not say anything to the women.
 White said he left the window for a few minutes, and when he came back, saw three officers wrestling with Blake. One punched Blake in the ribs, and another used a stun gun on him, White said. He said Blake got free and started walking away as officers yelled about a knife.
 Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Blake’s family, said Blake was “simply trying to do the right thing by intervening in a domestic incident.”

HORNELL -- The dry summer of 2020 might be tough on lawns and gardens, but it has made for an ideal construction season across the area.
   
 In the Maple City, a quick drive around town reveals multiple big projects in the works, from bridges to roofs and normal paving efforts. Seneca Street alone currently has two projects underway -- the ongoing replacement of the Seneca Street bridge and another shutdown to allow for roof repair atop City Hall.
   
 Department of Public Works Superintendent Mitch Cornish said DPW has fielded complaints about the closing of Seneca Street.
   
 "That should take two or three weeks up there. It was over 30 years, and it was starting to fail real bad," Cornish told the Common Council of the necessity for the roofing project. "The mayor got on board with us, and we got some money for replacing the roof on City Hall. It's going to take a couple of weeks. It's a flat roof. All the insulation has to come off. A new rubber roof has to come on. We're trying to make it as painless as possible."
   
 A bit further up Seneca, work on the bridge continues with Cornish anticipating it opening to traffic the second week of September, just in time for school to resume.
   
 The reopening of the East Main Street bridge will follow around the third week of October. Cornish said the nature of the bridge makes for a lengthy construction process.
   
 "There's a lot of concrete work going on down there," Cornish told the Board of Public Works. "People don't understand that when you pour concrete you have to wait for it to reach its strength, which takes 30 days. They'll pour something and take cylinder samples. They'll be watering it and they really can't do a lot until that concrete reaches its strength."
   
 One other bridge within the city limits remains closed -- Canisteo Street, which was declared unsafe for traffic. The replacement project is expected to go out to bid this fall with construction anticipated in 2021. Engineering is underway while work on the right-of-way continues.
   
 "Any time we go out of our highway bounds, we have to take temporary and permanent easement, so we're still working with a couple of homeowners there," Cornish said.
   
 Cone season
   
 If you see cones scattered around the city, it's part of an effort to shore up drainage infrastructure eroded by salt over the years.
   
 "As you notice around town, you'll see cones on the side of the road. I've got a couple of crews clearing drainage," Cornish said. "Just over time the salt that we put on the roads, it erodes the concrete and the galvanized piping that's in the ground, so we're going around trying to raise those when we find them. It just takes a little bit of time and money, so if you see those cones on the side of the road, we're still working on those."
   
 Paving projects
   
 The city's first round of 2020 paving projects have been completed on Thatcher Street Extension, Cass Street, Guernsey Lane and Allen Street.
   
 Next up in Round 2 are Upper Hill Street, Webster Street, Alley Avenue and Sherwood Avenue. Upper Hill and Webster have been receiving new curbs and drainage.
   
 Alderman Rich Argentieri inquired about the chances of getting some work done on Elm Street.
   
 "Elm is not on the radar for this year just because of the length of the street, the width, and how much money that will cost," Cornish said.
   
 Argentieri asked DPW to keep Elm on the radar for 2021, noting he get frequently gets calls on the area frequently.
   
 "Once you get down by the riverside it gets pretty hectic," Argentieri said. "We'll see what we can do next year."
   
 Rt. 36 aesthetics
   
 Mayor John Buckley said he continues to work with the state Department of Transportation on improved maintenance on state Rt. 36 through the city, such as mowing and trimming of shrubbery.
   
 "We'll try to keep making progress on that front," he said.

The mayor of Tuscaloosa announced Monday that the city is closing bars for the next two weeks after University of Alabama officials described an “unacceptable” rise in COVID-19 cases that could derail plans to continue the semester on campus.
 Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox announced the closures along with the end of bar service at restaurants during a news conference with campus officials. Maddox said university officials requested the action. Maddox said an unchecked spread of the virus threatens both the health care system and the local economy if students are sent home for the semester to do remote learning.
 “The truth is that fall in Tuscaloosa is in serious jeopardy,” Maddox said.
 The university did not immediately release case numbers, but school officials said there has been a rapid rise in cases, particularly among fraternities and sororities. The university on Friday had announced a moratorium on student gatherings both on and off campus.

The university on Friday announced a 14-day moratorium on all in-person student events outside of classroom instruction. Social gatherings are prohibited both on and off campus and the common areas of dormitories and fraternity and sorority houses are closed, according to the new guidelines. Visitors are not being allowed in dormitories and sorority and fraternity houses.
 Bell wrote that violations of health and safety protocols, both on and off campus, are subject to harsh disciplinary action, up to and including suspension from the university.
 Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey praised the mayor and university officials for acting swiftly.
 “They have made tough decisions, and I appreciate Mayor Walt Maddox and The University of Alabama leadership for tackling a serious problem as quickly as possible,” Ivey said.

 # Steve Ashmore: Here's my two cents' worth on the coin shortage
 Steve Ashmore
 Daily News blogger
 Have you been to a fast food restaurant lately? Did you stop by a convenience store on the way home to get your lottery tickets? Never mind the little stores, when’s the last time you went to a pharmacy chain, a big box store, or even a grocery franchise?
 If you’ve been paying attention, a number of these merchants are posting signs asking you to pay with credit cards, gift cards, or use exact change. Why? Because of a national coin shortage.
 Some of these signs simply point to a shortage and ask for our cooperation. Others explain that new federal regulations have fueled the deficiency. And while both are partially right, neither is completely correct according to several sources.
 While most of us can understand a paper money shortage, bills wear out after all. We slide them in and out of wallets, pant pockets, even socks and bras. They get washed, crumpled, and folded as they move from hand to hand. Even so, the average lifespan of a dollar bill is over six years. Fives and tens only last about five years each.
 But how do coins last? They’re made of different types of metal, not cloth like their more valuable cousins. Coins, according to the Federal Reserve, last an average of 30 years. So how did we get to a coin shortage?
 Going back to the store signs, is there a lack of coins and do federal regulations have anything to do with the matter? Again, the answer to both is partially right but not completely.
 A lot of people are afraid to handle money because of COVID-19. Instead of paying with cash and receiving change (bills and coins), more and more are choosing to use debit cards. Coins that generally are circulated through these transactions are simply not being transferred as often. After all, cards allow for exact amounts, including tips.
 The U.S. Mints did temporarily close down during the quarantine, but they are up and running again. The federal regulations cited have to do with caps that have been placed on the number of coins that may be shipped to certain areas. This is a temporary measure to ensure equal distribution of coins until the shortage subsides.
 The shortage is a circulation problem. The coins are out there, people are simply not using them.

“As soon as I finish (work), I go there. Amanda is generally there, too," Isaac said. "We at least see each other. She helps me manage all of the finances and runs a lot of the logistics of the business."
 The Paynes are parents to three boys: Haden, 13, Dylan, 10 and Sawyer, 5, all of whom are learning martial arts.
 The couple started their martial arts business nearly five years ago.
 “The mission is to teach people and to make them safer," Isaac said. "As long as it’s doing that, I can do my hobbies. Other people get to learn; everybody wins."
 Of course, the business needs to make back any costs it incurs to stay open, and so far it has, Isaac said.
 “Honestly, as long as it keeps supporting itself, that’s all I really care about," he said. "I feel like there’s a community for it — this family feel to it. It’s more than just people who come to my gym. They’re my friends, my surrogate family. They do as much for me as I do for them.”
 At the athletic club, the Paynes teach both the young and the young at heart. Children as young as 5 years old attend with 300 people attending at various times. Isaac spends up to three hours a night at the facility. At the gym, the couple teaches Krav Maga, an Israeli Army self-defense style; Brazilian Jiu- Jitsu; and a Thai style of boxing called Muay Thai.
 Martial arts make for a great workout, Payne said.
 “You take something like casually jogging that burns — depending on your body size — 400 calories a day," he said. "Active martial arts drilling is really hard and moving really well burns 800 to 1,000 calories an hour. It’s a very good exercise."
 Isaac's martial arts recently caught the attention of victims' rights advocate Elizabeth Smart. Isaac wrote a safety manual for Smart’s organization.
 “She wanted to put together a self-defense program that she could teach at her foundation," he said. "She sought us out. She’s very much on the same page as us — it’s something women needed to know. Women need to get acquainted with this as a life skill.”
 In the midst of starting his own martial arts academy, in 2018 doctors diagnosed Isaac with colon cancer. Surgeons removed a foot of his intestines to fight the disease.
 “I had surgery, and chemo started in November, the week after Thanksgiving,” he said.
 Chemotherapy continued through the following year. Isaac kept going to his gym but only for a few hours on Wednesdays. Thanks to his wife and fellow instructors, the Paynes’ gym continued to operate.
 “A lot of the instructors would help teach and pinch hit when I was too sick,” he said.

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) — The father of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, says his son was left paralyzed from the waist down.Blake’s father told the Chicago Sun-Times that he was told his son was shot eight times during the Sunday evening confrontation with police, which was captured on cellphone video and led to two nights of unrest in the city between Milwaukee and Chicago.The father, who is also named Jacob Blake and who was driving from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Kenosha to be with his son, told the newspaper that he learned Sunday night that officers had shot his son eight times and that he saw the now-viral video of it online a few minutes later that appears to show police shoot his son in the back.He said his son now has "eight holes" in his body and is paralyzed from the waist down, though doctors don't know if the paralysis will be permanent. Anger over the shooting spilled into the streets of Kenosha for a second night Monday, with police again firing tear gas at hundreds of protesters who defied a curfew, threw bottles and shot fireworks at law enforcement guarding the courthouse.The southeastern Wisconsin city became the nation's latest flashpoint in a summer of racial unrest after cellphone footage of police shooting Blake as he leaned into his SUV — apparently while three of his children were sitting in the vehicle — circulated widely on social media. The 29-year-old was hospitalized in serious condition.The shooting drew condemnation from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who also called out 125 members of the National Guard on Monday after protesters set cars on fire, smashed windows and clashed with officers in riot gear the previous night.Police first fired tear gas Monday about 30 minutes after the 8 p.m. curfew took effect to disperse protesters who chanted, "No justice, no peace" as they confronted a line of officers who wore protective gear and stood shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the courthouse entrance. But hundreds of people stuck around, screaming at police and lighting fires, including to a garbage truck near the courthouse.Tensions had flared anew earlier Monday after a news conference with Kenosha Mayor John Antarmian, originally to be held in a park, was moved inside the city's public safety building. Hundreds of protesters rushed to the building and a door was snapped off its hinges before police in riot gear pepper-sprayed the crowd, which included a photographer from The Associated Press.Police in the former auto manufacturing center of 100,000 people midway between Milwaukee and Chicago said they were responding to a call about a domestic dispute when they encountered Blake on Sunday. They did not say whether Blake was armed or why police opened fire, they released no details on the dispute, and they did not immediately disclose the race of the three officers at the scene.The man who said he made the cellphone video, 22-year- old Raysean White, said he saw Blake scuffling with three officers and heard them yell, "Drop the knife! Drop the knife!" before the gunfire erupted. He said he didn't see a knife in Blake's hands.The governor said he had seen no information to suggest Blake had a knife or other weapon, but that the case is still being investigated by the state Justice Department. The officers were placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice in a shooting by police. Authorities released no details about the officers and did not immediately respond to requests for their service records.Evers was quick to condemn the bloodshed, saying that while not all details were known, "what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said the officers "must be held accountable.""This morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force," he said, just over two months before Election Day in a country already roiled by the recent deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky. "Those shots pierce the soul of our nation."Republicans and the police union accused the politicians of rushing to judgment, reflecting the deep partisan divide in Wisconsin, a key presidential battleground state. Wisconsin GOP members also decried the violent protests, echoing the law-and- order theme that President Donald Trump has been using in his reelection campaign."As always, the video currently circulating does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident," Pete Deates, president of the Kenosha police union, said in a statement. He called the governor's statement "wholly irresponsible."The shooting happened around 5 p.m. Sunday and was captured from across the street on the video posted online. Kenosha police do not have body cameras but do have body microphones.In the footage, Blake walks from the sidewalk around the front of his SUV to his driver-side door as officers follow him with their guns pointed and shout at him. As Blake opens the door and leans into the SUV, an officer grabs his shirt from behind and opens fire while Blake has his back turned. Seven shots can be heard, though it isn't clear how many struck Blake or how many officers fired.White, who said he made the video, said that before the gunfire, he looked out his window and saw six or seven women shouting at each other on the sidewalk. A few moments later, Blake drove up in his SUV and told his son, who was standing nearby, to get in the vehicle, according to White. White said Blake did not say anything to the women.White said he left the window for a few minutes, and when he came back, saw three officers wrestling with Blake. One punched Blake in the ribs, and another used a stun gun on him, White said. He said Blake got free and started walking away as officers yelled about a knife.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, representing Blake's family, said Blake was "simply trying to do the right thing by intervening in a domestic incident." Police did not immediately confirm either man's account.Blake's partner, Laquisha Booker, told NBC's Milwaukee affiliate, WTMJ-TV, that the couple's three children were in the back seat of the SUV when police shot him. "That man just literally grabbed him by his shirt and looked the other way and was just shooting him. With the kids in the back screaming. Screaming," Booker said. Blake's father told the Sun-Times that his son also has three other kids.Blake's grandfather, Jacob Blake Sr., was a prominent minister and civil rights leader in the Chicago area who helped organize a march and spoke in support of a comprehensive housing law in Evanston, Illinois, days after the 1968 slaying of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.Rachel Noerdlinger, publicist for the National Action Network, told The Associated Press that the Rev. Al Sharpton spoke Monday to Blake's father, who called the civil rights leader for his support. Blake's father will speak at Sharpton's March on Washington commemoration on Friday, Noerdlinger said.Karissa Lewis, national field director of Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 Black-led organizations that make up the broader Black Lives Matter movement, said the shooting was yet another example of why activists have called for defunding police departments."There's no amount of training or reform that can teach a police officer that it's wrong to shoot a Black man in the back seven times while his children watch," Lewis said in a statement first shared with the AP.Online court records indicate Kenosha County prosecutors charged Blake on July 6 with sexual assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct in connection with domestic abuse. An arrest warrant was issued the following day. The records contain no further details and do not list an attorney for Blake.It was unclear whether that case had anything to do with the shooting.Crump, who has also represented the Floyd and Taylor families, said Blake's family has asked that demonstrations in response to his shooting remain peaceful."They don't believe violence to be the solution," he said.For more than 100 years, Kenosha was an auto manufacturing center, but it has now largely been transformed into a bedroom community for Milwaukee and Chicago. The city is about 67% white, 11.5% Black and 17.6% Hispanic, according to 2019 Census data. Both the mayor and police chief are white. About 17% of the population lives in poverty.___Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.

On top of that, up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall in some spots in Louisiana, said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana — in the bullseye of Laura’s projected path.
 “Whatever happens, happens. We’re going to roll with the punches,” said Capt. Brad Boudreaux, who operates a fishing guide service in Hackberry, Louisiana, near the Texas line.
 The silver lining for U.S. coastal residents is that an earlier storm — Marco — greatly weakened and became a remnant just off Louisiana’s shore on Tuesday. Satellite images showed a disorganized cluster of clouds. It was relegated to what meteorologists call “a naked swirl,” Jones said.
 The crew of a hurricane hunter plane confirmed that Laura became a hurricane with top winds of 75 mph winds (120 kmh) shortly after passing between the western tip of Cuba and Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. It was 625 miles (1005 kilometers) southeast of Lake Charles, Louisiana, heading west northwest at 17 mph (28 kmh).

Though locally it is considered a patriotic initiative taken by former president Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud, this was a Soma Oil and Gas project. ICJ rule in favor of Somalia meant another corrupt giveaway to this shady company that illegally owns Somalia’s natural resources. Farmajo is on board with a behind the curtain deal to pull the case out of ICJ and settle for a ‘negotiated’ deal with Kenya that brings in new partners. This may explain why there were multiple postponements of public hearings- something that, contrary to the Somali government’s claim, could not have been unilaterally done by the court. Hence, an official announcement after the extension is secured should shock no one.

Nine months after president Evo Morales left Bolivia amidst mass demonstrations and sobs of election scams, the Andean nation is when again in chaos. Tens of thousands of individuals took to the streets this month upset at hold-ups to a vote to change Mr Morales and requiring the resignation of interim leader Jeanine Áñez.          Luis Arce, the frontrunner for the delayed governmental and legal elections which will now happen in October, thinks he has the response to Bolivia's issues. “The only political party which can guarantee social stability, political stability and economic stability is us,” he stated in an interview with theFinancial Times “We have done it before and we are going to do it again.”          For his challengers, that is precisely the issue.

 But in July of this year it was revealed that prosecutors had decided to drop the charge more than five weeks earlier, clearing the way for him to return.
 There was a furious reaction from a disgusted public who saw it as a prime example of the impunity of the rich and influential in Thailand from prosecution.
 So severe was the backlash that authorities set up a number of committees to review the decision, leading to Tuesday’s about-turn. The results of each committee’s deliberations cast grave doubts on the competence and honesty of police and prosecutors who dealt with the case.

If you’d like to set up contactless payment technology, you’ll need an NFC- enabled reader. Because of the popularity of contactless payments, many point- of-sale (POS) systems released in the last few years already have this capability. But if you have an older system, you may require plug-in readers for your existing hardware.
 You may also need to update your software to meet contactless coding requirements and contactless chargeback rules — especially if you’ve added NFC-enabled readers to your current setup. It’s important to confirm that your software accepts the major payment networks including Amex, Visa and Mastercard. Consulting with your payment processing provider and financial institution will help you identify specific requirements for your business.
 Depending on the needs of your business, it might be worth replacing your hardware to take advantage of the latest technology. Some new POS systems not only allow contactless payments, but also integrate cloud-based apps that can help run your business more efficiently. For example, one system turns your sales information into insights about customer spending patterns and supports apps such as employee scheduling or reservation management.
 After you’ve met your hardware and software requirements, there are few ways to help your small business smoothly integrate this technology. First, let your customers know you support contactless payments. Placing in-store promotions or visible brands around your counter will create awareness that customers can tap and go. Second, train your staff in using contactless payments. If they understand the features of your new system, they can help your business operate more smoothly.
 As a growing number of people adopt contactless payments, integrating this technology will provide greater convenience and ease of use for your customers. Your financial institution can help you deploy this technology if you feel it’s the right fit for your business. Remember, small businesses that meet customer needs will position themselves to weather the storm and recover after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Once Farmajo became the president, the systematic process to cut off all advisors, technocrats, security experts, and members of the Council of Ministers who were from or were associated with UK began. In a parallel process, the relationship with UAE had to be suspended. This was critical for mainly two reasons: One, it would get rid of UK’s cash cow of corruption. “Let me call our friends” was the notorious code of reassurance used by British diplomates that UAE embassy will be delivering the cash. This under the radar process kept their hands clean. Two—perhaps more important than the former—it would pull the plug off on the (UAE-funded) ICJ maritime case.
