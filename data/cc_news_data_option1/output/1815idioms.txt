State officials initially did not want to include bars in the first phase of reopening Oregon counties. That is why bars and restaurants that open for dine-in service must close by 10 p.m. under the guidelines announced by Gov. Kate Brown.
 “It was an imperfect way to get at kind of what the intent was. Our intention was never to open bars,” said Leah Horner, who is Brown’s adviser on jobs and the economy. “But we didn’t want to close down people’s ability to get a drink from a bar in a restaurant.”
 There was not a clear licensure that would allow restaurants to serve liquor but keep other bars closed.
 “The only way to get at that was by putting a 10 p.m. closure time,” Horner said Friday during a videoconference of the Governor's Coronavirus Economic Advisory Council.
 Council members pointed to ambiguity and uncertainty in the state’s three- phase criteria for when certain businesses operations and public activities should resume.
 Horner acknowledged that officials were still figuring out how to share adequate information about the reopening from closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 As of May 15, furniture stores, art galleries, jewelry shops and boutiques may reopen if they follow the state’s physical distancing and health guidelines. Many other businesses can’t open until their county government files a reopening plan and then receives state approval.
 Horner, who also is the governor’s Regional Solutions director, said many details remain in flux, such as when face coverings would be required at certain types of businesses.
 “It may take a little bit to ramp up to that. We're still looking at what that timeline looks like but acknowledging there needs to be a little more clarity on that,” she said.
 Guidelines on child care, summer school, camps, gyms and transit will be announced next week. After talking with gym owners, Horner said, officials realized that some gym operations could reopen safely.
 Members of the economic advisory council asked for clarity on liability protections, travel and other issues.
 “As counties open up, if Deschutes County is open but Marion County is closed, could the residents of Salem travel to Deschutes County?” asked Todd Davidson of Travel Oregon.
 Jason Brandt of the Oregon Restaurant and Lodging Association pointed out that Brown did not shut down lodging but restricted travel, leaving the lodging industry in a bind.
 “For a lot of our lodging operators, they’re kind of just waiting on pins and needles to understand where they fit in on the phases,” Brandt said. “And then how they can prove, which a lot of them can already right now, that their operations are entirely safe for their guests and also for their employees?”
 He and others also asked about the prospects for weddings, group meetings and other events in hotels and elsewhere, as well as operations of zoos, museums and gardens.
 “State Fair folks said they’re not going to operate, but does that mean some of these maybe smaller meetings can still occur? I think the answer is probably yes,” Horner said. “So we’re going to be working through some of those pieces.”
 Union officials asked that better information be provided for workers, including what they should do if they are called back to their jobs but lack child care or are at high risk of contracting COVID-19.
 The governor’s staff said they are starting on developing worker guidelines. They also confirmed that the annual state minimum wage increase would occur in July as scheduled.
 Officials also announced that Business Oregon will be taking applications for matching grants for local governments that create COVID-19 grant or loan programs to assist very small businesses. The state initially will dispense $2.5 million.

Trump will, of course, be accused of flip-flopping having stood by bin Salman through thick and thin over the past four years while risking Iranian fury by taking out Republican Guard major general Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike at the beginning of the year.

No one should, therefore, be surprised if in the coming weeks and months there is a corresponding softening in his administration's stance on the Iranian nuclear deal.

SEATTLE — With the U.S. unemployment rate spiking to levels last seen during the Great Depression, people in Seattle have felt some of the deepest impacts as the first city to grapple with a major COVID-19 outbreak.
 Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the Downtown Seattle Association, said many employees began working remotely March 5, bringing a decade of growth “to a screeching halt.”
 The association this week estimated at least 57,000 of about 330,000 jobs downtown have been shed since March 1. Last week, hotel revenue was down 95 percent, according to the association, and automated vehicle traffic counters have been showing daily counts that are down by as much as half of pre-COVID levels.
 The region also saw the largest increase in the unemployment rate in the nation in March, the association said, based on federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data. More than $2.1 billion has been paid to people seeking jobless benefits in Washington, with more than 1.4 million claims filed since early March.
 The state’s stay-home order is currently in effect through May, but officials are beginning a phased-in approach to loosening restrictions. Scholes doesn’t see a quick path to recovery for many downtown businesses even when restrictions are loosened, partially because so many jobs can be done remotely and large businesses such as Amazon have told employees they can work remotely into the fall.
 “I think it’s going to be a long, slow climb out. Not a matter of months, but a matter of years, really,” Scholes said.
 There’s growing anxiety among local business owners and employees, with everyone watching the clock run down on the federal eight-week Paycheck Protection Program, he said, if they received it.
 Avout van der Werf, owner of two bars in the downtown area, said when the stay-home order went into effect he knew he couldn’t afford to keep everyone on payroll, so he laid off 25 employees and closed the bars.
 In mid-April he thought it was time to send a different message, so he reopened Shorty’s, known for cocktails, pinball and Vienna beef hotdogs, rehired a half dozen workers and started offering take-out.
 “The numbers make absolutely no sense … but for people to see the lights on and hear the music and they can at least say hello, I think it’s hopeful,” he said.
 He said businesses like his that were well-positioned to handle one stay-home order probably won’t be able to make it through another one.
 Scholes said more action is needed at the federal level to get cash to companies so they can keep employees on the payroll and lessen the need for rent relief and other such programs.
 Michael Maione, owner of Some Random Bar in the downtown area, laid out his business financials on Facebook, saying even if the bar/restaurant can reopen with 50 percent occupancy in June, his business will have lost more than $31,000 even while remaining open for take-out since the COVID-19 crisis began.
 “There’s not a lot of small businesses in America that have $31,500 just sitting in their checking accounts to lose,” he said. “And that doesn’t even include the fact that we’re not paying ourselves.”
 He said he has no plans to close in part because of successful GoFundMe campaigns and hope for relief through grants and loans.
 Scholes said when virus treatments and a vaccine are available, he thinks people will return.
 “The longer-term trends are really in favor of people wanting to be in urban dynamic places to work and play,” he said. “But they want to do that safely.”

"We have a big global community," Shtamer said. "It's super important for them to continue to feel they're connected. They can't lose the bond because we want them back when it's OK to go back."
 Jews and dancing go way back -- when Moses opened the Red Sea waters and the Israelites miraculously crossed it to the other side, they sang and danced in circles to celebrate their freedom. The Bible and Talmud refer to dance events several times. And in 1948, Israelis danced in the streets to celebrate their country's independence.
 Community dances first arose among the halutzim, or pioneers, of the First Aliyah in 1882, and others later brought them from the Diaspora. Major folk influences include the hora, which originally is a Romanian dance form, the temani from Yemenite Jews, the Hasidic from Eastern European Jews and the debka from Arabic folk, as well as Kurdish, Druze, Bedouin, Latin and more.
 "We are proud to have something unique, with so many influences," said Bitton, who is the son of a haredi Orthodox rabbi but left the religious fold. "It's very catchy all over the world, everyone can fall in love with our folklore in a minute."
 When the coronavirus outbreak started, Bitton quickly put together an online studio called Ulpan Bitnua for the Yeahbit project, which mixes Israeli folk dance, gym and Zumba. Five times a week, his team of quarantined instructors hold morning sessions from their own porches or living rooms. In the evening, online viewers are offered diversified content about Israeli folk dance, including a talk show and lots of dances, of course.
 "I feel the responsibility to keep people connected, they need to feel the sense of community. We must stick together until this crazy situation is over," said Bitton, who serves as head of Tel Aviv University's dance school of teachers and leads the folk dance section of Israel's national artistic committee.
 There are challenges to the online format, said Levi Bar-Gil, 56, an Israeli folk dance instructor.
 "Touching one another is a basic Israeli folk dance thing. Holding hands is the root of what dancing together is about. Smiling, talking, hugging, kissing, talking, everything is connected," he said.
 Every Sunday and Wednesday, Bar-Gil now holds a 45-minute Israeli dance session for kids on the Arutz Habidud, or isolation channel, a newly released online TV broadcast made live by the Hod Hasharon municipality.
 But instructors around the world are adapting.
 Brazilian-born Andre Schor, 33, is a rising star in the Israeli dance world. His hit dance called "Achi Karov Alaich" has been taught in several countries. Every Saturday online, he has been broadcasting Israeli songs to Brazilian dancers, where he comments live in Portuguese.
 Allon Idelman was raised in Brazil and immigrated to Israel in 2019. He runs a performance group called Olim Rokidim, which gathers 15 dancers who are all immigrants from Brazil, Turkey, France, Mexico, France and Uruguay.
 "It's tough to rehearse over the internet, so we have been keeping the social element alive in our WhatsApp group," said Idelman, a 42-year-old physiotherapist from Raanana. "We share Israeli dance-related material and celebrate personal dates and achievements."
 When Sarita Blum moved from Rio to Berkeley, California, 11 years ago, finding an Israeli dance environment was among her top priorities. Today she is part of a group called Cafe Simcha, where she learns and teaches.
 "During quarantine, when you feel the absence of people, I've never felt so connected to them," she said. "We video call each other all the time. I have been watching and sharing videos of dances that remind me of special moments of my life or special people."
 Blum travels to Israel every year and attends sessions with Bitton, Bar-Gil and several other instructors. She's used to dancing in online videos because she often sends them to her 8-year-old Israeli granddaughter.
 "Israeli dance is everything to me. It gives you a sense of freedom and unity," she said. "When you hold hands, you feel safe, you feel free. I hope we'll be all free to dance face to face together once again."

Maas said that during the last months, “we have witnessed attempts to stir up nationalist feelings by trying to rewrite history.”
 “Those who try to turn the victims into perpetrators and the attacked into attackers are violating the memory of the victims,” he said. “This is unacceptable.”
 Maas warned that political backing for international institutions is too often missing today, especially in the Security Council, whose mandate is to maintain international peace and security. He pointed to its failure to end wars in Syria and Libya and bring peace to the Middle East and Ukraine.
 France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the world today is witnessing “a brutalization of international life,” pointing to conflicts and “the multiplication of faits accomplis” from the South China Sea to Eastern Europe, the use of chemical weapons in Syria, Malaysia and on European soil, terrorism, new threats from cyberspace, and stiffening international competition.

Bear markets are exceedingly devious, taking their sweet time to inflict the most pain possible on the greatest number of traders. So sharp plunges to new bear-market lows that generate fear are quickly followed by massive bear- market rallies. These are the biggest and fastest gains ever seen in all of stock-market history by far! They quickly reestablish complacency, duping traders into believing the bear is over.
 The classic bear-market strategy is selling stocks and holding cash. If a bear market cuts stocks in half, holding cash through it doubles purchasing power so twice as many shares can be bought back once it runs its course. But cash not only doesn’t appreciate, its value is _rapidly being eroded_ at a wildly- unprecedented pace from the Fed’s colossal panicked money printing. The world is being flooded with new dollars.
 Thus a far-superior strategy is to weather this overdue and necessary stock bear in _gold and the stocks of its miners_. Gold tends to power higher on balance in strong bulls after stock panics, and there is nothing more bullish for gold than astounding currency debasement. The gold miners’ stocks soar during gold bull markets, with their profits growth amplifying the yellow metal’s gains. That’s well underway today!
 The bottom line is big US stocks’ just-reported Q1’20 results already showed significant weakness even with the lockdowns only starting into quarter-end. While the market-darling mega-cap techs dazzled, the rest of the leading US companies struggled with shrinking revenues, operating cash flows, and earnings. They sure knew big trouble was brewing too, as they greatly ramped their cash to ride out this economic storm.
 Yet they still exited last quarter averaging dangerous bubble valuations, despite having just suffered a brutal stock panic! That virtually guarantees the bear market is still prowling despite the monster Fed-conjured post-panic bounce. As sales and profits collapse in Q2 with spending plunging on the house-arrest orders and the resulting tens of millions of American jobs needlessly lost, stocks will be forced far lower.

On the operating-cashflow-generation front, the huge bifurcation between the mega-cap techs and the rest of the big US stocks was even more apparent. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook reported total OCFs soaring 17.8% YoY to $56.3b. But the rest of the SPX top 34 excluding the huge US banks fell 8.5% YoY to $91.3b. The banks’ OCFs are so incredibly volatile that they are totally ignored.
 Statements of cash flows are prominent in most quarterly results, but mega- banks not only don’t include them in press releases but never talk about them. They are only found buried deep in 10-Qs reported to the securities regulators. Big-bank financials are the most complex I’ve ever seen by far, and even as a CPA and former Big Six auditor I can’t hope to understand their exceedingly-specialized and opaque results.
 Interestingly big US companies _heavily hoarded cash_ in Q1 as they saw the writing on the wall from the shutdowns’ dire economic impact. Their overall cash treasuries surged 11.5% YoY to $911.7b! And that wasn’t skewed heavily to the Big Five techs. While their epic cash holdings did grow 12.5% to $458.5b, the rest of the SPX top 34 also boosted their cash by 10.4% to $453.2b. Companies were getting worried.
 _Cash is life_ in dark economic times. The more cash corporations and even individuals have heading into a crisis, the longer they can pay the bills and survive with impaired revenues. The leading US companies were clearly already preparing for a serious storm. And the easiest way for them to cut expenses is to fire employees, which we’re seeing in spades with the tens of millions of American jobs destroyed so far in Q2.
 The SPX top 34’s overall hard earnings under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles were disastrous in Q1, plummeting 61.9% YoY to $57.0b! Thankfully that number was heavily skewed by a couple major factors. First it includes Warren Buffett’s massive investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B). It is required to flush its gargantuan investment gains and losses through its income statement every quarter.

The controversial mixed martial arts card scheduled for Saturday in Florida will go ahead as planned despite one of the undercard fighters testing positive for coronavirus. Ronaldo 'Jacare' Souza was dropped from the Jacksonville event after he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Friday. He arrived in Florida earlier in the week. Two of Souza's cornermen also tested positive."UFC's medical team examined Souza and his two cornermen and found them to be currently asymptomatic, or not exhibiting the common symptoms of COVID-19," organizers said in a statement late Friday night. "All three men have left the host hotel and will be self-isolating off premises." Middleweight Souza, of Brazil, was scheduled to fight Uriah Hall on the undercard of the televised Ultimate Fighting Championship 249 event which is being held without spectators.Souza attended the weigh-in wearing a protective mask and was kept at a distance from Hall who also had a mask and gloves on.Although Souza -- who is not showing symptoms -- will not fight, the other 11 bouts will go ahead. Officials said the other 23 fighters on the card have tested negative."Brother I know it sucks. I'm sorry you have to go through this. I am beyond devastated for the missed opportunity," Hall tweeted on Friday night.The card is UFC chief Dana White's attempt to drag the mixed martial arts series out of coronavirus quarantine.White, who has also announced cards for May 13 and 16 in Jacksonville, insisted before Souza tested positive the production won't put anyone at risk."Listen, we have families, too," White told CNN Sport. "I have a family; I don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to die."This isn't just some crazy, this is a well thought-out plan. We've had very, very smart people, doctors and people that have been involved with the UFC for a very long time working on this thing non-stop since it started."We believe that we have this thing in a place where it can be as safe as it can possibly be."White's controversial plans to stage a fight card in April on an Indian tribal reservation in California were thwarted.But he got the green light in Florida to hold bouts without spectators from Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jacksonville, headlined by an interim lightweight title bout between Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje.Both fighters made weight on Friday at a weigh-in where media members and most UFC staff were kept at a distance, those closer to the fighters wore masks and the scale was sanitized.Bantamweight champion Henry Cejudo and former champ Dominick Cruz both made weight for their title bout as well.With the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer all on hold -- along with the US PGA Tour and LPGA -- White touts the return of UFC as a step toward normalcy and a boon for sport- starved fans.And he said US President Donald Trump would be watching, in a conference call with US sports league leaders back in April."The president's take on it was we have to get live sports back first," White told the Los Angeles Times."Show everybody how to do it safely. Give people who have to stay home some entertainment so they're not bouncing off the walls." "From there, we can figure out how we get people back to work and how we get kids back to schools," he added.He said by going first, he hoped other leagues might also reopen.White attempted to avoid California's lockdown measures when he planned the April 18 event on Indian casino land, but Walt Disney Co -- owner of UFC broadcaster ESPN -- later asked him to postpone.Florida governor Ron DeSantis opened the door when he gave "essential services" status to employees at pro sports and media productions with a national audience.bb/gph/tom

The salary reductions are expected to produce $3 million in savings and the studying of the fluid situation continues.
 “We are looking at other areas of our budget to make sure we are exploring everything on the table moving forward from today through July 1st of the year 2021,” he said. “The impact we’re trying to have is to minimize the effects on the student-athletes and their college experience. Everyone in the department will play a role, whether through salary reductions or furloughs, everyone will be helping us through these tough times.
 “We are looking at other areas of our budget where we can make cuts. Some of our Olympic sports, we’ve gone back and looked at schedules and what we can do to do some bus trips as opposed to flying on planes, a much more regional approach.”
 What will not be affected is the current plans for facility improvements as they have been funded either through donations that have been designated for such use or through the contract with IMG.
 That includes the upgrading of the Milan Puskar Football Center, the new Olympic weight room, the replacing of seats in the Coliseum and the video boards that are planned to go in the Coliseum and Milan Puskar Stadium.
 Lyons emphasized that the pandemic and the uncertainty it has produced forced these moves.
 “We can sit around and say we were dealt a bad situation with COVID-19 but that doesn’t solve anything. We have to have a solution that is action- oriented to deal with this pandemic,” he said.
 It isn’t pleasant action and it certainly will make for a long summer for many athletic department employees, but Lyons believes it that rather than a step toward surrender, it constitutes making a strong stand toward surviving through this.
 “We’ll definitely get through this and be stronger in the long run,” he said.

West Virginians have celebrated Mother’s Day since 1908 when the church hosted the nation’s first official service. The church is now a National Historic Landmark.
 In 1910, Gov. William E. Glasscock proclaimed the second Sunday in May a state holiday. For years later, President Woodrow Wilson designated Mother’s Day a national one.
 “The International Mother’s Day Shrine has preserved the history and sustained the tradition of celebrating Mother’s Day in the same building that fostered the holiday’s creation in 1908 – until this year,” read a news release from the shrine.
 “Respecting the safety of our friends and families and neighborhood, we decided on a virtual service,” said Katharine Antolini, vice chair of the board of trustees. “We didn’t want to cancel it outright because we’ve always had a service. Like many other churches, we decided to celebrate virtually.”
 The Mother’s Day service is the latest casualty of the coronavirus pandemic.
 “We believe it is best during the COVID-19 pandemic to use available technology to allow you, from the comfort and security of your homes, to join us for the 112th Mother’s Day observance,” Marvin Gelhausen, International Mother’s Day Shrine Board of Trustees chairman, said in a statement.

"Even as Jamaica navigates the COVID-19 crisis it is evident that there is much to do within our respective industries. Insurance has an important part to play in educating and preparing companies, their employees and people in general for any eventualities - unplanned or otherwise - that can occur in life," a news release from NCB quoted James.      He said, too, that financial inclusion would be a major strategic thrust for the IAJ in the coming months, with a view to have insurance companies develop products that feature smaller coverage options which will be more attractive to the masses.      "Insurance is a nuanced business and during my term, my administration and I have committed to make information simple and accessible to those who need it, and we will be providing wide-scale opportunities to make insurance more affordable to Jamaicans," he said.      "We want to take the mystery out of insurance, to make Jamaicans understand how important and necessary having an insurance policy is - instead of thinking of insurance with distrust," James added.      He spoke to the fact that insurance companies, both within the general and life sectors, are veering from the traditional sales agent model and are instead exploring new channels to make product and service delivery more cost- effective.      "The IAJ will continue to support its members and we will be designing some initiatives to ensure we practise knowledge transfer and adhere to international best practices in an effort to make our local industry more competitive and resilient," James said.      Prior to his appointment as president, James served on the IAJ board of directors in the capacity of vice-president (life) over the last two years. He succeeds Peter Levy, from the general insurance sector, managing director of British Caribbean Insurance Company, who served as president since 2018.      The IAJ presidency rotates between general and life sectors biennially.   James brings to his term in office 20 years of experience in the financial sector.

The tapioca pearls are available in various different sizes according to the requirement in the food products it is used in. Recently, very small tapioca pearls are available in the market as these do not need cooking and they can be used just by soaking them in hot water. This is more popular in the households as the tapioca pearls can be quickly used in the desserts or for any other end use applications. Also, coloured tapioca pearls are available in the market.

The Ruger 57, in my opinion, is a better pistol at less than half the price (street price). For a detailed look at what makes the pistol unique and why it is such a driver of Ruger's image turnaround, take a look at the video here.
 Furthermore, the company created even more buzz with the March launch of the Ruger PC Charger, or what is in my opinion the ultimate personal defensive weapon.
 While the firearm was destined to be an NRA show release, the pistol was released early, upon learning that the NRA show in Tennessee would be canceled.
 The Ruger PC Charger is a variant of the very popular Ruger PC Carbine, and is not only a very much desired configuration of the firearm, but is also BOTH fun and practical.
 What is nice for shareholders is that the PC Charger is certainly going to drive further sales of other Ruger pistols with which it shares magazines, such as the Ruger Security 9 and Ruger American pistols.
 The video here highlights why this firearm is so well liked by gun owners and why there is so much buzz around it.
 Beyond the Ruger 57 and the PC Charger, the company also launched the Ruger LCP 2 in 22 LR and the Ruger American Competition pistol in 9mm. While both of these pistols are not brand new models, they are new variants which will expand the appeal of the existing handguns.
 The newly introduced models contributed to 20% of the company's Q1 earnings results and will surely increase throughout the rest of the year as the company continues to ramp up the production and the models have been around for the entire quarter (The Ruger PC Charger and Ruger American Competition pistols were introduced in the last two weeks of the quarter).
 ## Looking Ahead & Bottom Line
 What I feel is quite exciting for Ruger investors is that the massive surge in NICS checks and firearms sales is not coming off of a major tragedy. This surge in sales is coming off of a mass awakening of Americans who saw the value and reasoning behind the 2nd Amendment and are exercising it for the first time.

The controversial mixed martial arts card scheduled for Saturday in Florida will go ahead as planned despite one of the undercard fighters testing positive for coronavirus. Ronaldo 'Jacare' Souza was dropped from the Jacksonville event after he was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Friday. He arrived in Florida earlier in the week. Two of Souza's cornermen also tested positive.
 "UFC's medical team examined Souza and his two cornermen and found them to be currently asymptomatic, or not exhibiting the common symptoms of COVID-19," organizers said in a statement late Friday night.
 "All three men have left the host hotel and will be self-isolating off premises." Middleweight Souza, of Brazil, was scheduled to fight Uriah Hall on the undercard of the televised Ultimate Fighting Championship 249 event which is being held without spectators.
 Souza attended the weigh-in wearing a protective mask and was kept at a distance from Hall who also had a mask and gloves on.
 Although Souza -- who is not showing symptoms -- will not fight, the other 11 bouts will go ahead. Officials said the other 23 fighters on the card have tested negative.
 "Brother I know it sucks. I'm sorry you have to go through this. I am beyond devastated for the missed opportunity," Hall tweeted on Friday night.
 The card is UFC chief Dana White's attempt to drag the mixed martial arts series out of coronavirus quarantine.
 White, who has also announced cards for May 13 and 16 in Jacksonville, insisted before Souza tested positive the production won't put anyone at risk.
 "Listen, we have families, too," White told CNN Sport. "I have a family; I don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to die.
 "This isn't just some crazy, this is a well thought-out plan. We've had very, very smart people, doctors and people that have been involved with the UFC for a very long time working on this thing non-stop since it started.
 "We believe that we have this thing in a place where it can be as safe as it can possibly be."
 White's controversial plans to stage a fight card in April on an Indian tribal reservation in California were thwarted.
 But he got the green light in Florida to hold bouts without spectators from Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jacksonville, headlined by an interim lightweight title bout between Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje.
 Both fighters made weight on Friday at a weigh-in where media members and most UFC staff were kept at a distance, those closer to the fighters wore masks and the scale was sanitized.
 Bantamweight champion Henry Cejudo and former champ Dominick Cruz both made weight for their title bout as well.
 With the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer all on hold -- along with the US PGA Tour and LPGA -- White touts the return of UFC as a step toward normalcy and a boon for sport-starved fans.
 And he said US President Donald Trump would be watching, in a conference call with US sports league leaders back in April.
 "The president's take on it was we have to get live sports back first," White told the Los Angeles Times.
 "Show everybody how to do it safely. Give people who have to stay home some entertainment so they're not bouncing off the walls."
 "From there, we can figure out how we get people back to work and how we get kids back to schools," he added.
 He said by going first, he hoped other leagues might also reopen.
 White attempted to avoid California's lockdown measures when he planned the April 18 event on Indian casino land, but Walt Disney Co -- owner of UFC broadcaster ESPN -- later asked him to postpone.
 Florida governor Ron DeSantis opened the door when he gave "essential services" status to employees at pro sports and media productions with a national audience.

When my son makes a birthday card for a family member and draws a family portrait in Crayon, I figure that’s good practice with drawing and coloring. When my daughter insists on typing in the password to log into her Chromebook at the start of the school day — painstakingly finding and then pecking each number in succession — I figure that’s good practice with recognizing her numbers.
 Yes, it may be a far cry from the usual academic instruction they’re missing by not being in class, and yes, it might be setting the bar on the low side, but it’s better than nothing.
 Even when an assignment goes awry, I remind myself that it’s still an opportunity for learning.
 When my son plays a game on the computer (instead of doing his math problems) in which he has to save a family of otters, that’s a sneaky way for him to be learning about animal behavior and habitats — right?
 And when my daughter has to formulate a list of her top 10 favorite words — words that make her laugh, to be precise — I try not to shudder when she spells out “poop” and “pee” and “toilit” in her determined, scraggly letters.
 After all, I figure it’s good that she’s challenging herself with trying to spell tougher words, like “farte” and “puooke” (puke) and “chicin butt” (chicken butt), and goodness gracious, “diureeue” (diarrhea).
 They may not be the most appropriate words to write for this or any assignment, but it’s still good spelling practice — right?

KEARNEY — A few weeks ago, the four children of Tad and Jessica Edeal — Landon, 15, Harrison, 11, Brynna, 10, and Boston, 6 — saw their newborn sister Baylor for the first time.
 They didn’t peek into the hospital nursery. They didn’t cuddle her in person. Instead, they stood outside their mother’s hospital room and peered in through a window at the one-story Kearney Regional Medical Center.

So the internal aspects of it is fine. We have our assumptions and those are assumptions what drive our view that this should be done in third quarter ever, but other factors COVID continuation we are going to wait and see. We had to use a plan we think it's realistic based on everything that we're hearing so that's really how we came to feeling comfortable and this can be delivered in the third quarter.

At the same time, he has cautioned against the move becoming a triage process, and noted that there could be fewer hospital admissions due to the recommendation for individuals to stay home.      He raised the points Thursday during a virtual meeting of Parliament's special select committee of on public health.      Health Minister Dr Christopher Tufton, who chairs the committee, announced on Wednesday that expanded testing will include all hospitals.      "We have to ensure that this system doesn't lend itself to a triage where you make a determination in terms of your capacity to test, but I do understand the need. I see, too, in light of the recommendations by the ministry that patients stay at home, there seemingly is going to be less hospital admissions that are going to be taking place," Dr Guy said.      He suggested that some analysis could be also be done to examine whether, over the past two months, there has already been a decline in the approximately 15,000 hospital admissions that are seen per month.      Chief Medical Officer Dr Jacquiline Bisasor-McKenzie told the committee the health ministry wants to return hospitals to a state of normality for all patients, even while it addresses the COVID-19 crisis.      "What we want to do is return our hospital to a sense of normalcy, not just in terms of the care of patients who have COVID[-19], but patients who have chronic disease[s], who have surgeries to do, persons who present to the outpatient department and the emergency department. We want to ensure that the belief that someone could be COVID[-19]-positive does not detract from getting what needs to be done for that person. We would want everyone who comes into the hospital to be tested so that persons could have a certain level of comfort in terms of any type of management that is required for these patients," she explained.      Dr Bisasor McKenzie said health authorities want to be able to rule out COVID-19 with certainty when patients die in hospital.      Member of Parliament for St Andrew Southern Mark Golding noted, however, that there is a distinction between testing persons who have died, to be sure of the cause of death, compared with testing all persons who are admitted to hospital.      "They are two different issues completely. I can certainly understand the testing of persons who have died, especially if there is any reason to suspect COVID[-19], to make sure COVID[-19] numbers are more accurate, but persons entering hospital - that's a different matter," he remarked.      Dr Tufton told the committee that in 2019 there were between 170,000 and 180,000 admissions to hospital. Golding pointed out that those numbers meant that testing every hospital admission would mean a major resource allocation.      "If it is that you have adequate capability for the tracking and tracing and you're doing that efficiently, and you decide to do some more random-type testing and you're using hospital efficiencies to do that, I don't have a problem with that," he said.      The CMO, meanwhile, emphasised that testing protocol continues to evolve in the face of COVID-19, and that admissions testing will provide an opportunity to expand random sampling. At the same time, the health minister noted that more testing will over time actually lead to a decline in testing, depending on the clinical presentation of cases.

SALEM, Ore. — Some churches are suing Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, arguing her coronavirus stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional.
 Oregon Public Broadcasting reported the lawsuit by the churches, including Elkhorn Baptist in Baker City, are being led by Common Sense for Oregon, a nonprofit led by former Republican candidate for governor Kevin Mannix.
 The Pacific Justice Institute is arguing the case for the plaintiffs. It says it “seeks to invalidate” three orders, starting with Brown’s initial emergency declaration, signed March 8.
 Lead attorney Ray Hacke said plaintiffs are all over the state.
 “There’s a rising tide of churches and churchgoers wanting to push back against Gov. Brown’s oppressive executive orders, and this case will hopefully remind her that she is not free to dispense with constitutionally protected liberties, even in emergencies,” Hacke said.
 The suit argues that emergency powers only last for 30 days and after that Brown would have needed legislative approval.
 Brown outlined a detailed plan Thursday for beginning to reopen the state in the coming weeks, while stressing that reduced restrictions on businesses and residents could be rolled back if the virus numbers increase.
 Counties that have had few cases of the coronavirus and that can meet strict guidelines may be able to reopen certain businesses as early as next Friday, under the first part of the plan. Additionally, the state will loosen restrictions on day cares and retail shops statewide next Friday, while monitoring infection levels.

If you are just watching Natalia Partyka from afar, you won’t notice anything different. Her footwork is top-notch. Her backhand and forehand are fierce. Her reaction time is good. Her defence is solid. She looks and plays like a top table tennis player.
 But then look a little closer and you realise just how impressive she truly is. As she prepares to serve, Partyka, who was born without a right forearm, carefully balances the ball at the end of her elbow before tossing in the air and onto her racquet.
 Now 30, Partyka attracted the world’s attention during the London Olympics in 2012. By that point, she was already competing in her second Olympics but it was her skill and not her disability that made everyone sit up and take notice. It was also the first time she was taking part in the singles competition.
 Partyka was eliminated by the Netherlands’ Jie Li in women’s singles Round of 32 in London. Let that sink in – yes, it wasn’t the podium, but being one of the top 32 women in the world _in any field_ speaks of a level of excellence that is not easily found.
 “For me, it (disability) is nothing,” she told reporters after losing her third round match to Netherlands’ Jie Li. “I am playing the same lines as the others. I am doing the same exercises.
 “We have the same goals and the same dreams and I can play like them. I can serve and don’t have any problems.
 “I get a bit bored about being asked about disability all the time.”
 She is happy, however, if her achievements act as an inspiration to others.
 “Maybe someone will see me and realise that their own disability is not the end of the world,” she said.
 “Maybe someone will look at me and think they can achieve something bigger than they thought. Maybe sometimes you have to work a little bit harder if you really want to do something. If I’m an inspiration I can’t complain.”
 The Polish table tennis star, though, has been used to raising the bar.
 At the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games, when only 11 years old, she was the youngest competitor on duty at the event as a whole, not only in the table tennis events.
 Four years later in Athens, when 15 years old she won gold to become the youngest ever table tennis player to secure a Paralympic Games title.
 She kept playing, she kept winning and she kept pushing herself to get even better. Starting with Athens in 2004, she has no less than five Paralympic Games gold medals to her credit.
 In 2008, she also became one of only five athletes to ever participate in both the Paralympic and able-bodied summer games. More have followed in her wake, refusing to let a mere disability get the better of them.
 Too often, people only see the hurdles. But Partyka only saw the possibilities and that allowed her to attain her highest ITTF ranking of 48 in singles.
 “Everything about me is made of table tennis. The sport has taught me to ‘work hard,’ ‘never give up,’ and ‘always fight for my dreams’.”
 And at the end of the day, that is what it comes down to. Are you prepared to truly fight for your dreams? For if you are, as Partyka has shown, nothing can stop you.

For the last five years, Chinese firms such as Huawei have played a significant role in setting global technology standards for 5G and building out mobile infrastructure via bodies like the ITU. Other Chinese firms are eager to follow suit and contribute more to the global standards-setting process, which would help advance Beijing’s vision of a more China-influenced technology stack. But the US government and some data privacy advocates believe that greater involvement by Chinese companies in multilateral technology standards-setting efforts could materially alter the course of global norms in ways the US and other democracies would not support. Effective global standard-setting that balances this tension with Beijing’s stated ambitions of the DSR appears to be increasingly difficult.

Contact tracing is a powerful and important strategy used to contain and mitigate the spread of infection of reportable diseases, such as COVID-19, local health officials said this week.
 Contact tracing has been successfully used to mitigate outbreaks of tuberculosis and measles, said Dr. Anubhav Kanwar, who specializes in infectious diseases, tropical medicine and traveler’s health at Tri-State Memorial Hospital in Clarkston.
 “We are in a perfect situation for doing contact tracing in this valley,” Kanwar said, pointing out the number of cases in Nez Perce and Asotin counties are relatively low, which makes contact tracing that more effective. “The time to act is now; if we get to the point that it is widespread, it will not be that effective.”
 This is how Kanwar summed up contract tracing: “You test someone and it is positive, then you interview the person to know who they came in contact with and then you interview those people. Then you test the high-risk contacts and you quarantine or isolate. Negative tests are quarantined for 14 days and those with positive tests, you isolate them.”
 Contact tracing has been employed by local and state health departments for decades and is a key strategy in today’s fight to prevent the further spread of COVID-19, said Tara Macke, public information officer with Public Health – Idaho North Central District.
 “That’s how South Korea was able to contain this pandemic,” Kanwar said. “They worked very swiftly.”
 Idaho’s seven public health districts employ epidemiologists who regularly perform contact tracing. Plans are in the works to train and use other staff members and use others trained in contact tracing to meet the increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, Public Health Nurse Mike Larson said.
 “Public health staff work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the time frame while they may have been infectious,” Macke said. “Then they warn those contacts of their potential exposures as rapidly and sensitively as possible.”
 Public health staff members give the contacts information, education and support to help them understand the risk and what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed. Contacts are also told to monitor themselves for illness and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they do not feel ill, Macke said.
 Public health officials protect the privacy of patients by informing contacts that they may have been exposed to a patient with the infection, Macke said. The identity of the patient is not disclosed.
 Investigations can take less than an hour to several days, depending on the patient and their close contacts.
 COVID-19 is a reportable disease, so all positive tests are automatically flagged and sent to the local public health district, Larson said.
 Public health officials get in touch with the health practitioner to get more information, but they make sure the practitioner has had time to discuss the results with the patient and come up with a plan of care, Larson said.
 After that, the public health investigator wants to know if the patient is at home or in the hospital, which determines where they go next in their investigation. If the patient is in the intensive care unit, the investigator will have to modify their approach because they may not be able to talk to the ICU patient.
 “The purpose of the contact is to start our investigation on this reportable disease,” Larson said. “Now we try to figure out where the illness started or where they may have come in contact with it.”
 The patient is asked if he or she has traveled recently, been around people with similar symptoms, or around a person who has tested positive.
 “All can be clues to where the illness might have been contracted,” Larson said. “We also look at whether or not people from the same types of areas would have traveled and been in contact.”
 Food is an area of inquiry for food-borne illnesses, but is not a focus in investigations into COVID-19. However, if a person has traveled internationally and consumed exotic foods, then investigators will ask about it, Larson said.
 The investigation is dependent on how much people remember and how much they are willing to share.
 With COVID-19 investigations, public health officials are looking back at travel 14 days from the onset of symptoms, Larson said.
 For contact tracing, which begins after the initial investigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends public health officials go back 48 hours from the onset of the recognized symptoms of COVID-19, such as headache and fatigue, fever, cough, shortness of breath or a loss of taste or smell.
 To determine the infectious period and when a positive case is no longer infectious, public health officials follow three factors, Larson said. The first factor is 10 days after the symptoms start, the second is 72 hours after the last major symptoms occurred that were not controlled by medical intervention, and finally a general improvement in the patient’s respiratory condition, Larson said.
 Once the infectious period is determined, the contact tracers identify who that person was in close contact with during that period. Close contact, according to the CDC, is within 6 feet of a person for 10 minutes where the patient was not wearing a cloth mask and the person in close contact was not wearing PPE, such as an N-95 mask, Larson said.
 If a person who tested positive for COVID-19 happened to be shopping in a store during their infectious period, public health officials probably won’t contact that store, because normally that person would not meet the CDC definition for close contact with anyone in that store. If there were some situation where close contact may have happened, then public health officials would describe the situation to the public and ask the people involved to contact public health officials, Larson said.
 “Did anybody ride in the car with a person during their infectious period? Were the windows up or down? It makes a difference,” Larson said. “We drill down to determine who the close contacts are.”
 Once a list of contacts are established, those people are contacted, but the privacy of the patient is maintained, Larson said.
 Public health officials keep in touch with the contacts for 14 days. If they develop symptoms, they are referred to their primary care provider, and that provider is informed that the patient has been in contact with a positive case.
 In a household of three people with one person who has COVID-19, all three are asked to stay home, Larson said. If that person’s symptoms started on the first of the month, they are considered infectious from two days before that through the 10th of the month, then three days must pass before the 14-day quarantine period begins for the other two people in the household.
 If one of those people develops symptoms and tests positive, then the 14-day quarantine period for the other person would not start until another period that factors in two days before the onset of symptoms, 10 days with symptoms and three days without symptoms, Larson said. But the original patient could leave the house after three days of their symptoms going away, Larson added.

I giallorossi dovranno fare il callo a giocare, per qualche mese, in un'atmosfera surreale non solo fino alla fine di questo campionato ma molto probabilmente anche per l'inizio del prossimo. Tocchera prendere confidenza con il silenzio assordante, anche il Benevento ha gia dimostrato di averci dimestichezza dopo il 4-0 rifilato al Pescara. Un danno inenarrabile in termini economici per la societa sannita, che si apprestava, tra lo sprint finale in B e il nuovo inizio in A, campagna abbonamenti inclusa, a immagazzinare soldi freschi da reinvestire nel progetto tecnico o che sarebbero serviti a rimpinguare le casse. Anche in questo caso, il Benevento, che aveva dalla sua un entusiasmo dilagante, e di certo il club che ci sta rimettendo di piu in termini economici. È di ieri invece la notizia che l'Ifab (International Football Association Board) ha approvato la proposta della Fifa e ha dato il via libera alle 5 sostituzioni (al posto delle solite 3). I 5 cambi andranno effettuati al massimo in tre momenti diversi (cio vuol dire che in due casi saranno doppi): una misura che consentira ad Inzaghi di gestire al meglio le energie e le corde muscolari dei suoi nel caso aumentassero le partite in tempi ravvicinati, durante l'estate e col caldo, per recuperare quella fetta di stagione saltata tra marzo e maggio. Il tecnico, in questo modo, potra dare spazio anche a chi e stato impiegato di meno. Non trattandosi di una norma obbligatoria, tocchera alla singola Lega (italiana o estera) decidere se introdurre o meno questa regola, ma e probabile che anche per la salvaguardia della salute e della condizione fisica dei calciatori, tutti i campionati che ripartiranno finiranno con l'utilizzarla.

Another misperception of the DSR is that it is a masterplan by Beijing to deploy its “techno-authoritarian” model to countries along the BRI. Certainly, Chinese companies export facial recognition technology and privacy-invasive cyber infrastructure that is used in emerging market countries — yet deployment of these technologies in emerging markets is very much a demand- driven phenomenon. The DSR relates to these trends in that Beijing is seeking (paywall) to align global technology standards developed by bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) with proprietary technologies used by Chinese suppliers — an effort that is easier if countries are already using made in China technology. This would give Chinese firms an advantage over competitors also working to meet this demand.

“What we’re seeing over the last few weeks is an increase in individuals waiting to go to the hospital when they probably should have gone a day or two earlier,” Jeffrey said. “Our office has received several calls about people afraid they may ‘get the COVID’ if they go.
 “I would like to assure the public that the EMS is taking extra steps to make sure our ambulances stay disinfected. If you do need an ambulance, I encourage you, please call. Do not wait until it’s too late. Do not wait if you’re having symptoms of a stroke, if you’re having chest pains ... please call us,” he said.
 According to Kent Koster, Purchase Health Department director, the department is also seeing a decrease in the number of positive COVID-19 cases in the area.
 Noting that the previous week saw an uptick in the number of cases, “this week it’s been very slow and it’s very encouraging to see that,” he said. “People are getting used to the social distancing, as difficult as that might be.”
 He also encouraged people to continue to wear masks to combat the spread of the disease, particularly as some businesses reopen beginning Monday.
 McCracken County Judge-Executive Craig Clymer said it appears “we are approaching the downward slope” in the fight against COVID-19, and to continue to support those in decision-making positions.
 “These decisions are difficult. I honestly believe that the people who are the decision-makers are doing their very best,” he said.
 Mayor Brandi Harless praised the efforts of the hospitals and health department, and encouraged the community to continue its prevention efforts.
 “It’s important that we remember we’re still in the middle of a virus outbreak,” she said. “We have done a great job of making sure we prevent the spread in our community.
 “But the more we open up our businesses, the more likely it is we’re going to see the spread continue. I’m a big fan of what we’re doing right now and this very thorough, measured approach. This does mean we all have to take the personal responsibility to be compliant as we get out and about.”

Now a source spilled the tea to _HollywoodLife_ saying marriage is not too unlikely for the couple as Zayn is ‘determined’ to take this step with the supermodel.
 “Zayn is determined to marry Gigi. They haven’t made any announcements about an engagement but it’s only a matter of time. He is very eager to make her his wife. It won’t shock any of their friends if they secretly get married before the baby is born. They can always do the big wedding after.”
 While Zayn is currently living across the pond from his family in the United Kingdom, they are still keeping touch with the former One Direction member as well as Gigi and her family.
 The insider continued: “Gigi has a great relationship with Zayn’s family, they love her and as soon as they can travel they will want to come to America to celebrate the new baby. Gigi’s mom and Zayn’s mom talk all the time and they have an open invitation to come stay at the farm.”
 Another source told the publication that while things had been shaky for the two in the past, they are in a much better place with the baby on the way.
 “Zayn and Gigi have had their ups and downs but now everything is on the up and up with the baby on the way. Friends and family have seen the instant change in both of them with the news of having a child. They both know they have all the help and support in the world and everyone is really looking forward to what the future is going to bring. It really has put a spark in their relationship,” the grapevine revealed.

While air conditioning may blunt the effects in the United States and some other wealthy countries, there are limits. Before the new study, one of the previously highest heat/humidity events ever reported was in the Iranian city of Bandar Mahshahr, which almost reached a 35C wet-bulb reading on July 31, 2015. There were no known deaths; residents reported staying inside air- conditioned vehicles and buildings, and showering after brief sojourns outside. But Horton points out that if people are increasingly forced indoors for longer periods, farming, commerce and other activities could potentially grind to a halt, even in rich nations-a lesson already brought home by the collapse of economies in the face of the novel coronavirus.

For some time now, the practice of free speech on college campuses has been challenged by America’s increasingly complex social and political fabric — particularly heading into a hotly contested presidential election year. Yet, as the primary season began to unfold, so did a global pandemic that dramatically altered the college experience for millions of students whose classroom discussions and campus chats moved strictly online. Only time will tell whether and when there will be a return to normalcy on campus, yet the views of young people on free expression are likely to influence how we regard the First Amendment and the rights it enshrines in the U.S. for decades to come.
