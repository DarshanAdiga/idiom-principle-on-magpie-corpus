A federal government initiative to save thousands of businesses from sinking into insolvency during the pandemic was full of good intentions.
 But a new analysis suggests all it's doing is creating a new breed of "zombie" companies and paving the way for a tsunami of insolvencies when the support measures end at the end of the year.
 This week Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter decided to keep the insolvency and bankruptcy protections in place until December 31.
 They are also extending relief for company directors from any personal liability if they oversee firms trading while insolvent.
 "These changes will help to prevent a further wave of failures before businesses have had the opportunity to recover," the pair said in a statement.
 "As the economy starts to recover, it will be critical that distressed businesses have the necessary flexibility to restructure or to wind down their operations in an orderly manner."
 However, a study by digital credit agency CreditorWatch indicates that all it is doing, in a number of cases, is putting off the inevitable.
 It found business administrations fell 37 per cent from July to August and are 59 per cent lower than the average across 2019, meaning that thousands of businesses are now relying on government support to stay afloat.
 CreditorWatch CEO Patrick Coghlan said while the legislation was critical in stabilising the Australian economy as it went into recession, the measures are now becoming counterproductive.
 "They are propping up companies that should be allowed to fail," Mr Coghlan said on Wednesday.
 "By extending the moratorium to December, the government is wasting taxpayer money by kicking the can down the road."
 He said solvent businesses are having to trade with otherwise insolvent debtors, risking their own business health, whilst doomed businesses are able to put off paying creditors or even the Australian Taxation Office.
 Coronavirus-hit Victoria saw a 49 per cent drop in the number of businesses filing for bankruptcy in August, while NSW saw a 34 per cent fall, following a more modest decline of around nine per cent in July.
 CreditorWatch found Queensland was the most impacted by the government measures, posting a 25 per cent decrease in insolvencies in August on top of a 39 per cent drop in July.

Ackles also dropped a fun bit of trivia about the almost-casting of Dean and Sam's dad, John Winchester. Because Jeffrey Dean Morgan was only 12 years older than his eldest TV son when he played the role in the pilot flashbacks, the producers wanted a different actor to portray the character when he came back into the story. "They actually went out to [ _Evil Dead_ vet] Bruce Campbell to play Present-Day Dad," Ackles revealed. "That was the only person that they wanted. Ultimately, they couldn't make it happen, whether it was [because of] schedule or whatever. So they kind of threw their hands up in the air, and they're like, 'Well, maybe we can just age Jeff up and have him come back and play an older version of himself.'"

In fact, he has also played on the aforementioned new album which will come out next year, and will continue to collaborate with us in the future as a special guest. However, our sound has evolved in a way which made keyboards less and less relevant, and it wouldn’t have been fair to Lele - or to any other keyboard player - to be officially in the band, and at the same time put to the sidelines in terms of actual contribution to the songs. We wish him the best for the future, and of course, he will keep being an integral part of my other band Crimson Dawn, so all his fans can rest easy, nothing has changed there!"

 First, the peppers will need to be roasted, not only to remove the outer skin, but to also impart a charred flavor to them. Preheat the grill to 400 to 450 degrees F., and carefully place the peppers on the grill. Cover and let roast for a few minutes, turning them frequently with tongs as they begin to char. When the peppers have softened and charred, use tongs to remove them to a plastic bag and seal it tightly, or place the peppers in a bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. This will allow the peppers to “sweat,” and you can easily remove the charred outer layer. When the peppers have cooled enough to handle, discard the charred pieces and carefully cut the peppers so they will lay flat. Remove the stems, inner membrane and seeds, and discard.
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
 While the peppers are resting, place chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat. Break the chorizo into pieces with a wooden spoon and, frequently stirring, allow to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add onions and garlic and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well. Add Rotel tomatoes and oregano and reduce heat to low. Stirring occasionally, let the mixture cook for another 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
 Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with non-stick spray.
 Add one-half of the chorizo mixture to the baking dish. Top with 1 cup of the cheese. Using about half of the peppers, add a layer of the peppers on top of the chorizo mixture.
 Repeat the layers using the remainder of the chorizo, 1 cup of cheese and the remaining peppers. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, flour and a pinch of salt together.
 Slowly pour the egg mixture over the top of the peppers and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the top starts to brown and the eggs are set, but still soft.
 Let rest for 2 to 3 minutes, cut into squares and serve. Top with chopped cilantro and sour cream.

In hosting sport events, there will be some non-negotiables during the pandemic such as wearing masks until the Maricopa County ordinance is lifted, David Loutzenheiser, executive director of secondary education, told the Governing Board.
 “Look at it from this perspective: ‘If I’m a senior athlete and I’ve done so much work and I’m finally being allowed to play, why would I want to have people put us in a position that there could be an outbreak or something like that and now I lose my time again,’” Loutzenheiser said.
 He added the district will stream all football and volleyball games so if people are uncomfortable showing up at the stadiums or gyms, they can watch it via NFHS network.
 All game tickets will be sold online through the GoFan app and people can show the ticket on the phone to enter an event.
 “All East Valley school districts will be using GoFan so even if you are traveling to another event, you will be purchasing your tickets through GoFan,” Loutzenheiser said. “We do not anticipate having a ticket gate opened.”
 He said for football games, the district plans on purchasing or renting more portable stands to allow for social distancing.
 There will be no limit on the number of fans who can attend games, but family passes will be sold with a limit of four per pass.
 Loutzenheiser said the first volleyball game was scheduled for Sept. 22, the first freshman football game on Sept. 30 and the first varsity football game on Oct. 2.
 However, should the district be forced to change course after the board voted to reopen campuses full time to students and teachers on Tuesday, contingency plans are in place.
 If health metrics were to go the wrong way and the campus has to return to remote learning, games will have no fans in attendance, teams will maintain social distance on the sidelines or benches and there will be no concession stand and no spirit line and marching band at football games, according to Loutzenheiser.
 If there’s a partial return to campuses, a limited number of game tickets will be sold depending on the size of the venue; mandatory masks if social distancing is not possible; extra seating and no family passes, he added.
 Loutzenheiser said the district will provide bus transportation for athletes to and from games but parents can opt to drive their student instead.
 The district also is looking into the cost of adding another bus to allow for increased distancing between students, Loutzenheiser said.

I am writing in response to a recent column titled “Do your pro-life views reflect in the candidates you support?” It depends on how you define pro-life. To be truly pro-life, one must embrace all the many facets of life. The unborn is a life that needs to be cared for from womb until natural death. After that child is born, does your candidate then support him or her financially? Perhaps they are born to a poor mother who needs social programs. The child will need education support, medical care and perhaps this child is born with preexisting conditions. Does your candidate support medical insurance for all life? Maybe this child becomes a homeless adult and needs support. Or perhaps this person is mentally ill or physically challenged. A person with special needs requires a lot of financial support through many social programs. But what if this person becomes a criminal? Does pro-life end here? Do we condemn them to die through capital punishment? Who gives us the right to take the life of another, whether they are preborn or aged? Does your candidate support programs for the elderly, and the cost of their care by paying their caregivers a decent wage?

Google is continuing to develop a profile as the low-code/no-code cloud tool provider (see - AWS, Google, Azure to battle it out over low-code, no-code platforms) with the announcement of its Business Application Platform, upon which it's positioning  its recent acquisition of Apigee API management, and its work with Appsheet, a no code development environment.
 Google's goal is to foster the rise of what it's calling the "citizen developer" who can be given an 'easy to use' interface to build business apps, automation and API management, without having to learn coding to participate.
 With capable tools at their disposal, goes the story, capable employees will be able to assist in the acceleration of their organisation's digital transformation. This, says Google, is transformation beyond the aegis of the IT department. It is the democratisation of application design and development.
 It's launching new features for Apigee and Appsheet to assist the process.  A new API Gateway means developers can secure and manage their APIs across Google's cloud computing services and serverless offerings. AppSheet is getting new tools for automating processes, so meeting the promise that developers won't have to write any code. Instead, they get a visual interface which offers contextual contextual suggestions in natural language.
 The objective isn't to circumvent the IT guys, but to supplement their efforts. As such it fits with the general thrust of all IT development since at least the 1970s. In that, what starts out as a 'white coat' environment is made simpler to understand and eventually can become, if not exactly democratised, then opened up to a wider range of employees where appropriate. Think of the development of the PC and its distribution to departments and their managers where it could be used for departmental budgeting and financial control.
 It started as an innovation but tightened its grip over time to  the point where  today, an understanding of Excel has become a requirement pretty-much across the board.
 It's possible, indeed it's a probability, that this sort of decentralisation will take similar shape over time when it comes to building cloud applications. Tools such as Google's Business Application Platform will serve in a similar role as the old macro languages did by enabling   simple routines on a spreadsheet. In the same way cloud tools will enable all sorts of routine processes to gather information or initiate changes within the cloud, and could be designed and managed at the departmental level, rather than 'only' by the cloud IT professionals.
 This is not just an altruistic opening up to allow staff to contribute. As Excel became a hard requirement, not just a 'nice to have', it no doubt helped to tighten up effective financial control across industry.
 Google thinks the need for accelerated transformation has only been heightened by the pandemic and is banking on its low-code/no-code cloud platform to give that trend a similar boost.

 Although the PC version of Among Us is doing well—it's the number three most- played game on Steam at the moment, with a peak of 182,774 players today—most of those 1.5 million players have come from the mobile version, which is free.
 Emma Matthews summed up the popularity of Among Us by saying, "More than anything, Among Us' appeal stems from its focus on the players, and this is one of the reasons why it's not only fun to play with friends, but also entertaining to watch. If you're playing with a group of big personalities, there are bound to be some fireworks. Tensions mount as people become increasingly frustrated about potentially losing, or begin to sweat about getting found out."

RELAX… BUT NOT TOO MUCH’ | As “Someone Special” began, right where “Fine Together” left off, Derrick insisted that he was just at the Cryers’ to board up the door, per Jim’s instructions, and pleaded with Hanna to inform the police who he was. “Do you really wanna talk about who you are?” she asked. She was having none of it this week — maybe even less than none. After the police ascertained Derrick’s identity with no help whatsoever from Hanna, David came by, as Jim had asked him to. She wasn’t having any of it from him, either. “Do you not see me ignoring you?” she snapped. Hell no, she wasn’t telling David diddly to tell Jim, she answered only to Katheryn. By the time she drove away, I’m pretty sure that the judge had suffered burns that were worse than the ones on his back. “Damn,” he muttered. Agreed.

“When you drive by it doesn’t look bad. But if you try to walk through those fields, they are impossible to walk through,” he said.
 Concerns about the condition of crops and how it will impact harvest equipment and yields are at the top of the minds of farmers in Clinton and Jackson counties whose fields were among the 3.57 million acres of corn and 2.5 million acres of soybeans in Iowa that took the worst of hurricane force winds in the summer storm.
 “The storm damage is extremely variable in Eastern Iowa,” Bowman noted, adding that either side of Cedar Rapids took the worst hit. As for how that will impact profitability, Bowman and other agriculture experts said only time will tell.
 “It’s yield times price that determines our profitability or lack thereof. I can make guesses right now, but until I roll with the combine, I’m not going to know,” Bowman said.
 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig noted the double whammy of the derecho and drought that the state has weathered along with a pandemic.
 “This is an unprecedented situation on top of another unprecedented situation,” he said in an online presentation organized by the Iowa State University Extension and Outreach office. COVID-19 supply-chain disruptions on top of weather events are starting to compound stress on farmers.

As a 17-year educator, I find it ironic that Education Minnesota emphasizes differentiation of instruction for our students because each child is unique, but the idea of school choice — the ultimate way to individualize education — is often demonized. School choice would allow families, especially those in low-income areas, a way to go to schools that are more effective and provide quality education. No profession can exist for 150 years and not innovate. While schools have been modernized with technology and teachers work tirelessly to use best practices in the classroom, this is a vital time to examine what and how we teach to provide educational opportunities for students that meet the changing demands of the workforce.

“We’re basically working on a policy that all of our projects will be completed with pollinator friendly ground cover,” he said. “We’ve been working hard to get our financing partners comfortable and on board with the concept of establishing pollinator friendly ground over at these sites.”
 Creating a self-sustaining meadow around a solar field is not as simple or as cheap as it may sound, according to Farrell. The plantings need to be carefully managed to keep out invasive species and to not shade the arrays. It’s a higher upfront cost, but it’s hoped the benefit over the long run will be less maintenance.
 Farrell said solar fields need to be mowed up to three times a year, which costs money and raises the risk of a panel being damaged by a stray rock or other debris. After a few years, however, the hope is the sites won’t need to be mowed as often or at all.
 Farrell said his company likes to keep track of this in terms of acres rather than projects. In Vermont, Encore has about 40-acres of pollinator-friendly ground cover, and if one counts projects in development or under construction it’s about 110 acres. The company has 100 acres in New York and Pennsylvania.
 He said he’s heard from people living near these sites that their gardens and flowers are doing better, as the pollinators don’t stick to a single site.
 Green Mountain Power has worked with Bee the Change on two of its sites one in Milton, the other in Ferrisburgh.
 “There is an extra cost up front, so you have to approach it differently, but we believe that over time we will see savings,” said Kristin Kelly, a spokeswoman for GMP.
 The company saw results in terms of pollinator numbers almost right away, she said.
 “We have seen increasing populations of insects, birds, bees and butterflies over the past three years at our first solar project with Bee the Change,” stated Sam Carlson of Green Lantern Solar in a release. “We wanted to build on the success of our first project with Bee the Change and demonstrate that solar projects in Vermont can and do improve pollinator-friendly habitat, which is so vital to Vermont's agricultural productivity and landscapes.”

IN A tragic turn of events, the Top of the Blackbutt Range Bazaar, Boutique and Local Produce markets are the latest COVID casualty this year.
 The boutique market was set to replace to the Avocado Festival, as a smaller, more-COVID friendly alternative to the popular annual event. The Blackbutt Avocado Festival has been growing for ten years and was set for another huge year before organisers were forced to pull the plug.
 Addressing devastated locals via Facebook yesterday, Chairman Jeff Connor said despite the financial strain on sellers, the recently elevated safety risk posed by COVID-19 is too great to ignore.
 “We have taken the financial risk and burden to deliver an event in these uncertain times, and today we announce the uncertainty that COVID-19 continues to deliver has outweighed the gain we had intended to bring to our town of Blackbutt,” Mr Connor said.
 “Therefore we are cancelling the Top of the Blackbutt Range Bazaar, Boutique and Local Produce markets on October 4.   “The new event was put together by the committee of the Blackbutt Avocado Festival in an effort to boost confidence and support local businesses; as well as those people who use the markets as an outlet to sell their goods and wares.
 “However, when the South Burnett was identified as a region requiring to increase restrictions, the confidence of our community took another hit, and so did some of the confidence from travellers looking to make the South Burnett home for the October long week.”
 Despite having put together a CovidSAFE plan for the event, the increasing number of cases in surrounding areas, including Toowoomba, forced the committee to re-evaluate whether the risk of holding the event was still greater than the reward.   “If there is one thing the community can be assured about, it’s that our committee has not given up, we won’t give up; we continue to work to deliver greater good to our town,” Mr Connor said.
 “There is a next event we look to, a next Avocado festival, and even a Big Avocado on the horizon. We always work towards the horizon, that’s what event organisers do, it’s certainly what the Blackbutt Avocado Festival committee do.”

The North Bay Police Services Board is looking at recent work from Toronto and Peel police for "as much information as possible" on the use of body cameras.
 North Bay Police Chief Scott Tod said Tuesday following a police services board meeting that the idea "is to take the information" from what other police services have gathered as it prepares to implement the technology locally.
 That information will look at what technology and platforms offer and how they can be put in place by police in North Bay.
 One option, he says, is to work with other police services in the North in particular, using economies of scale, to help bring the cost down.
 Earlier this year, police services board chairman Dennis O'Connor said he hoped the technology could be in use before the end of the year.
 Toronto police have been studying the issue and were to prepare a report. The Toronto service has indicated it will share its data with other police services.
 North Bay police have been studying the issue for several years now, and while the cost initially had been prohibitive for a small service like North Bay's, the costs have been falling steadily.
 Toronto had originally been looking at a cost of $80 million to outfit all 6,000 uniformed officers with the cameras, which would include the cost of the computer systems, the cameras and data transfer.
 In June, O'Connor said, the estimate had fallen to about $10 million.
 The cameras document police officers' interactions with the public and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said they're one relatively simple way to address complaints that police in Canada treat racialized people unfairly.   Trudeau said he wants the RCMP and municipal and provincial police services to use body cameras.   The RCMP rejected body-worn cameras in 2016 because testing revealed technical problems. The Mounties said it couldn't justify purchasing thousands of them for more than 750 detachments.   Kevin Walby, associate criminal justice professor at the University of Winnipeg, who has studied the use of body-worn cameras on police, said studies in North America looking at the use of these cameras show mixed results. He added there is little proof that use-of-force cases are significantly reduced.
 In some cases, Walby said, police felt emboldened by the presence of the camera.   The North Bay Police Association, which represents uniformed and non-sworn members of the service, agrees that body cams should be adopted "the sooner the better."
 Const. Aaron Northrup said the association, which represents uniformed and non-sworn members, is "very supportive" of body cams, which would be worn by officers, as well as dash cams for cruisers.
 The cameras, Northrup says, "offer great transparency," providing an officer's eye-view of incidents that can be downloaded and, if necessary, be used in court.
 Northrup also argued that audio of the interactions can be just as beneficial, if not more so, providing an extra dimension of information about the incident.
 One issue is whether the cameras will be on all the time, or whether they can be turned on and off by the officer. He said units that are always on, or are turned on automatically when an officer leaves his or her cruiser, would be best.
 "Cameras will help, but I think there is a lot of verbal interactions" that would benefit from a full-audio system, as well.
 "They are a great tool. They are good for citizens and police," he says.
 "If an officer does something, it's there," and if a citizen complains unfairly about an officer's conduct, it is also available.

“A lot of preparation goes into showing the animals,” she said, adding it was her first time showing a calf. As for showing horses, Ciera’s a pro, having done so since the fourth grade.
 “I was really skeptical whether we would have a fair this year,” she said, admitting she would have been “kind of bummed” if the show was canceled.
 Then news came. Her mother, Robin Krogman, a leader with the local 4-H chapter who had been receiving updates from fair coordinators on a daily basis, reported the show was on, albeit, in modified form.
 “When I heard we were having a fair, I was super excited,” Ciera said. “I knew my effort didn’t go to waste.”
 The Krogmans, who live in rural Clinton County, belong to Equine Fever 4-H Club. The county’s 14 active 4-H clubs were fortunate their show wasn’t canceled like so many other summer events in light of coronavirus.
 About 90,000 4-H chapters across the country provide hands-on experiences in health, sciences, agriculture and civic engagement to roughly 6 million young participants.
 Hadley Jacobi, who’s 11 and lives on a 80-acre beef cattle farm near Grand Mound, likes to show cows and sheep at the Clinton County Fair.
 “I feed them everyday,” she said. “I wash them. I water them. I raised my heifer here on my farm.”
 Judges look for things such as body size and shape, condition of the feet, and how well fed the livestock appear, Hadley said.
 Due to pandemic restrictions, judges could not do one-on-one interviews with 4-H participants like in years past. Hadley’s mother, Jessie Jacobi, said the change was unfortunate, as interactions with judges teach children necessary interview and communication skills.
 “The kids brought the stuff in and the judges came in and judged it,” Jacobi said. “But the kids could not sit in front of the judge. It’s disappointing. It’s a learning experience for the kids. Everybody made do.”

Desde hace algún tiempo, cuenta a #JuntosCrecemos, tenía planeado pagar por publicidad en esta red social tan importante a nivel mundial -de acuerdo a las estadísticas mundiales de internet, la penetración de Facebook en América Latina es del 57.3 por ciento a través de FacebookAds-, pero ante la necesidad latente que vieron por la contingencia sanitaria decidieron concretar la idea e incursionar en la publicidad pagada, lo cual enseguida les dio resultados alcanzando hasta un 200 por ciento en ventas, “avanzamos en un mes, lo que no habíamos avanzado en seis años”.
 Manifestó que el uso de redes sociales para posicionar el negocio ha funcionado de maravilla, “antes se invertía en publicidad por volantes mensuales, durante de tres años solo llegaron dos clientes pero aquí por un mes pagando 200 pesos me llegaron más de cien clientes, no hay proporción, ha sido bastante útil”.
 La campaña publicitaria de Kalé funciona de la siguiente manera: una vez por semana dan a conocer sus últimas promociones o recuerdan las promociones ya existentes con alcances a habitantes de Cuernavaca, Emiliano Zapata, Jiutepec y Temixco, lo cual demuestra como el uso de redes sociales, en especial ante la pandemia, se ha fortalecido; 7 de cada 10 personas cuentan con acceso a internet en el país, informó el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI), es decir, en 2019 el número de usuarios de Internet en México llegó a 80.6 millones, lo que representa el 70.1 por ciento de la población total.
 A raíz de la pandemia y al notar que las personas siguen sin salir de sus hogares, Kalé cuenta con la promoción de que la pastelería paga los 35 pesos del costo de envío; Alejandro Castillo aseveró está promoción ha sido muy bien recibida por sus consumidores, mandado hasta tres servicios diarios; si bien no siempre se registran las mismas ventas si se han mantenido, “no siempre puede ser para arriba pero cuando aplicamos promociones vemos que vamos para arriba”.
 Kalé pastelería ofrece además dos rebanadas de pastel en 60 pesos y el pastel grande entre 350 a 380 pesos, comercializando también velas, regalos y otros utensilios para fiestas. En la compra de un pastel grande de línea, puedes llevarte un litro de helado entre 200 a 230 pesos, así como también te bonifican 50 pesos en el envío del taxi.

The stock of Tata Elxsi Limited, at its high point yesterday, marked ₹1,226.6 – its highest price in almost two years. Effectively, the stock breached the resistance at ₹1,200 and made a higher high, indicating a strong upward movement.
 The scrip began rallying from a low of ₹500 in late March; the up-move continued and as on Tuesday, the stock had multiplied by more than twice. After witnessing a correction, it swiftly bounced back on the back of the support of 21-day moving average at ₹1,060. The stock then went on to break the prior high yesterday. The price action indicates that the bull trend is strong, and the price will most likely appreciate from here.
 Corroborating the positive bias, the relative strength index is indicating a strong momentum in both daily and weekly charts. Similarly, the moving average convergence divergence indicator has been charting an upward trajectory and in the weekly chart, it indicates that the momentum is increasing consistently. Hence, traders can buy with stop-loss at ₹1,180 and look for a target of ₹1,300.
 (Note: The recommendations are based on technical analysis. There is a risk of loss in trading.)

Sulle responsabilità della fuga, le versioni sono diverse. Il re Vittorio Emanuele III, l’8 settembre 1945, in una risposta al questionario formulato dall’ammiraglio Garofalo, aiutante di campo del Principe di Piemonte, scrive: “Fino alle ore 24 dell’8 settembre il Maresciallo Badoglio e i generali parlarono di resistere se i tedeschi avessero attaccato Roma. Alle 3 e mezzo del giorno 9 i generali dissero essere impossibile ogni resistenza. Il Re non voleva lasciare la capitale, ma si decise a partire da Roma perché il Maresciallo disse che aveva ordinato a tutti i ministri di lasciare Roma. Badoglio disse anche che gli ordini dati erano in corso di esecuzione. Il Re seguì il governo nazionale in territorio completamente nostro (Brindisi) ove non vi erano ancora truppe alleate” (Puntoni, P., _Parla Vittorio Emanuele III_ , Il Mulino, Bologna 1993, p. 297)

The Walker location can accommodate up to 200 children, and the Y is still hiring staff to work in the centers. Fees for the virtual learning center are on a sliding scale and depend on a family’s income. Scholarships are available to help offset the cost as well.
 Bonita Patton, senior youth and family director for the Brooks Y, said the centers will be a learning experience for all involved and that she expects a lot of trial and error during the first week as the staff members work to help students get up and running in their online classes and back into a school routine.
 “We want to support them the best way we can,” she said.

In the span of two days, the Islanders went from playing what Greiss called their best defensive game in years, a a 4-0 win over the Philadelphia Flyers in Game 7 on Saturday, to being overwhelmed by the Lightning. A contributing factor was the quick turnaround Sunday as New York switched NHL bubble cities by flying from Toronto to Edmonton, Alberta. The team didn't get much sleep and had to adjust to a time change before playing its sixth game in 10 days.
