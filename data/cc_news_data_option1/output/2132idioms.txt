Last summer, when I was going through a valley, facing a loss, it didn’t feel like there was a way that my heart could ever heal. I fixed up a little motto where I wrote, “I bring my broken dreams to You. You heal, love, and make new.”
 Taking a rose, I took it all apart and spread the petals around the motto, symbolizing my crushed heart. I set it in the kitchen where I’d see it often.
 Now looking back, I can tell that yes, God has healed, loved, and made new in ways I didn’t think would be possible; I can’t say it doesn’t hurt anymore, but neither does it sting like it used to.
 Yes, take heart; keep giving those crushed, broken pieces back to the only One who can do anything about it. Oh ya, I forgot to mention that at the bottom of the motto in big letters it said, “His love is never-ending.” True, whether I can connect with that idea even a single percent or not, it’s true.
 You fill in the blanks of what cuts into your heart. I know, after reading some of your letters that undoubtedly some of my weekly letters to you all have to cut into your heart, reminding you of a loss in your life.
 Without question, memories are brought back so real that it feels like it’s just happening all over again.
 I know what you mean. Why just writing about the valley I went through last summer has brought fresh tears again. Yet I know God will use this to heal on deeper levels of my heart — areas that are really too deep for any other human to see or understand.
 I have to think of a phrase in a song that has become special to me, “No one can see the pain inside like my Father can, no one can give a brand new start like my Father can...”
 While others are a tremendous blessing in our lives through times of loss or grief, there is only One who can heal.
 I have to think of our heart as a room with many compartments. Sometimes some corners really feel too painful to even think about. Leaving that door tightly closed and not visiting that corner feels so much safer. But then as we allow God to really ‘take a peek at it,’ and we simply pour out to Him the hurt and pain and rejection we feel, giving Him all the pieces that have been hiding for so long, there seems to be a balm, a ray of His love light penetrating deeply in that area of our heart.
 Healing takes place like we never imagined possible, and yes, in the end we say it was worth visiting that painful spot because we were not alone. Our Savior walked the way with us.
 Many of you are parents and know the fight in a mother’s heart to want to protect her children from having to face hardships. Life is so uncertain, no one knows what all their lives will hold.
 Why if only I could just protect them from it all. Last winter, when they were sick, it dawned on me anew that even little things as such can help prepare them for the hard knocks of life.
 And as much as I like taking all of them with me to run errands, it’s just not always practical.
 Yesterday when I had to make a quick run to the post office to check my options on shipping granola, my mother’s heart ached for one of my little ones running to me with outstretched arms to tell me bye. I could see he was blinking back the tears at the disappointment of not getting to go along. After assuring him that I’ll be right back, I was off with my taxi driver.
 I knew that even this can be an opportunity for them not just to play the pity poor me game.

 I never thought I'd leave Bucks County. I was 2 when I arrived, 56 when I left. I sold my place in Yardley at the end of January and moved to Palm Coast, Florida.
   
 I've been reading the Bucks County Courier Times every day since I was a little girl, so I'm subscribing online; what a bargain! And at this unprecedented point in human history, what a vital connection the paper's been to all I've grown to love about home.
   
 Then all hell broke loose. It's beautiful here. The weather has been a great comfort to me, a blessing during this confined, hunkered-down life. I worry about everyone at home in Bucks County. But my family plays by the rules so mom, my kids, my sisters and their families are all healthy and safe as I type this.
   
 None of my friends or former colleagues have been diagnosed with COVID-19 coronavirus. I've been on social media a lot -- who hasn't? Another blessing right now. So I have to ask, why are so many Bucks Countians out and about?
   
 You're complaining about the filthy latex gloves littering the supermarket parking lot, but you just posted yesterday that you were at another store and found toilet paper. Then you posted a lovely photo of you and your kids riding bikes in a closed public park.
   
 Please recognize that you're part of the problem. No, you are the problem -- you aren't staying home. We've got essential businesses that need to operate safely now to limit community spread and decrease deaths.
   
 Vital lines of work. These are grocery, food/beverage, delivery and home improvement businesses that need your support. The small local businesses are starving and the large essential corporations are hiring people and offering bonuses.
   
 Can we please help them help us? We'll rely on those businesses once we've hit the downside of this pandemic. Please spend a few extra dollars to keep them all in business now. Have everything you can think of delivered, get creative!
   
 Find workarounds, stretch your groceries or order takeout. Just please stop rushing around the neighborhood looking for organic milk, or running out to get the cumin you don't have to make that new recipe you saw on Facebook.
   
 The community spread isn't happening in your living rooms folks. Just stay home.

Roberts, who was also on the Monona Grove-Madison Edgewood wrestling co-op and a runner on the track and field team, received offers from some NCAA Division 2 and Division 3, but his knee injury ended any hopes for a college football career.
 That’s when he decided to follow the path of his brother and other family member and join the military. He said joining the Army was bigger than continuing to play football in college, and he could participate in something that could make others, including himself, very proud. He was stationed at the Army airborne unit in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. His three-and-a-half years there provided him with a great education.
 “Some of the skills I learned were how to become a better follower, taking more responsibility for my actions, becoming a leader and taking pride in my work,” Roberts said. “I wouldn’t be who I am today if it wasn’t for my decision, and I am extremely happy with that.”
 After leaving the Army in May 2015, Roberts earned his commercial driver’s license and worked for Wisconsin Distributors. He was trying to return to a normal civilian life, but later, signed with the Army Reserves.
 He landed a full-time position as a field service representative at PBBS Equipment Corp., a Cottage Grove-based company specializing in the installation and maintenance of boiler systems for industries and large business. He married his wife, Lauren, and had two children, a boy and a girl.
 He also left PBBS and now works for the federal government servicing and repairing military vehicles and equipment.
 It’s been a long time since Roberts used his legs to gain yardage and score touchdowns for the Monona Grove High School football team. But since then, he has grown as a person by serving his country in the Army, getting married and becoming a father. He is thankful for everyone who helped him deal with the uncertainties of life.
 “My dad, mom, brother, uncle and grandparents were all instrumental in helping me make the right decisions throughout my life and supporting me no matter what,” he said. “They have helped push and teach me to be the man, father and husband I am today. My kids and my wife help support me on a daily basis with struggles and goals that I have for my future. I strive to be the best person I can be, and that is all thanks to my strong support system, my family and values they have taught me.”

MANTENO — Some mothers and grandmothers teach their children and grandchildren how to bake, knit or crochet. Susan Milton was not known for these skills. Sue taught her children and grandchildren how to get their hands dirty from farm work. She also showed them how to get gussied up for a night on the town. Sue proved to them time and time again that it was possible to live it up on Saturday night and still be in church on Sunday morning. She instructed them how to make her famous apple pie for the church potluck (buy a frozen pie and brush egg white on top before you bake it). This beloved matriarch also trained her grandkids which swear words were acceptable to use during farm work, and when not to say those words in front of their parents. Sue showed them how to find a deal in a thrift store and when to splurge on a great piece. She enjoyed driving a spiffy car with a lead foot, and was known to get out of a speeding ticket or two by faking intense intestinal distress. Her grandkids remember a number of particular shared experiences: Being pinched until the words “pretty Ahma” were uttered, taking shortcuts that made a one- hour car trip three hours long, and pushing her grandsons into lingerie sections of department stores and yelling so everyone would look. She teased her family relentlessly and loved them unconditionally.
 Susan Mary Martin was born Sept. 11, 1939, the daughter of Vivian (Rieck) and Theodore Martin, in Kankakee. She came from a long line of strong-willed women and passed that characteristic on to the generations who follow her. She passed away May 25, 2020, surrounded by her kids, after battling Alzheimer’s Disease. She was a sister to Sandra, Tom and Michael and a beloved aunt to many nieces and nephews. She was a graduate of Kankakee High School and enjoyed staying connected with her classmates.
 She often reflected, “All I ever wanted was to be a wife and a mother.” On Dec. 1, 1957, Susan married the love of her life, Sherman “Kelly” Milton, a handsome farmer from rural Rockville Township, Manteno. Susan quickly adapted to farm life and helped with nearly every aspect of farm work. Her love of animals extended into fostering any creature in need, and her barn cats were the best fed in the county. The Miltons were named runners-up for Farm Family of the Year in 1982. Sue felt a tremendous sense of pride in her sons and grandson continuing the farming tradition.

“A billionaire? With a ‘B’?” Woodhouse recalled asking him.
 But if Woodhouse had any qualms about digging in on defense against various titans of industry, he quickly learned that everyone was competitive.
 “If you’re not playing defense, they’re going to call you out,” said Woodhouse, who would temper his Friday night activities in anticipation of The Run. “If I’m 25 and struggling to get up and down the court because I was out with my friends, and these guys who are running companies are showing up and playing ball, then I have no excuse. It became such a healthy place to be.”
 The Run also often doubles as a day care. If you lose, that might mean you need to keep an eye on several of your friends’ toddlers. Back when the Feigins’ (now teenage) sons were much younger, Lasry suspected that Peter Feigin or Dan Feigin would give them a secret signal to scamper onto the floor if their team was losing.
 “That’s just my view,” Lasry said. “But I could swear by the 10th time it happened, it was not an accident.”
 More recently, Tom Kearns, a mental health counselor and one of The Run’s longtime staples, has been bringing his 12-year-old daughter, Sophia, so she can shoot hoops on the side with Dan Feigin’s 12-year-old daughter, Dylan. Afterward, a big group heads to City Diner on Broadway for brunch.
 “It’s really a family,” Kearns said.
 In all, about 100 players have played in The Run over the decades, some more luminous than others. When Lee was shooting his film “The Best Man,” he brought actors Taye Diggs and Morris Chestnut to the gym. Lasry, who has been active in Democratic Party politics, has invited various campaign staffers. And everyone was thrilled when Keefe showed up.
 “We love good players,” Dan Feigin said.
 But no matter how skilled the player, new members are included on a probationary basis.
 “Sometimes it goes up for judicial review to make sure The Run is harmonious,” Lee said. “Do we want this guy to keep playing? Does he pass enough? Does he play defense?”
 And if a new player does not endear himself to the group, it tends to reflect poorly on whoever invited him in the first place.
 “That’s a stain on your career,” Dan Feigin said.
 Before life as we knew it went on hiatus in March, Peter Feigin was occasionally returning to New York from Milwaukee for weekend visits — and to rejoin The Run, which has become multigenerational. Peter’s son, Thomas, and Dan’s son, Jackson, are both high school juniors and excellent players. They cause matchup problems for their fathers’ friends.
 “Being able to play ball with your son is kind of like the best of the best,” Peter Feigin said. “It’s like winning the life lottery.”
 Now, the lockdown has forced some of The Run’s long-standing members to confront their athletic mortality. Lasry, 60, had already become less of a regular presence in recent years. “As you get older, it’s just harder to keep up with everybody,” he said.

Where’s the president’s authority to override governors on this matter?
 I’m not a constitutional attorney, but I do have common sense.

 Is it complicated during a difficult time like this when governors have a responsibility to manage the health and welfare of the citizens of their state? Of course it is.

Italian soccer is considering allowing fans into stadiums next month.
 The Italian federation issued a 40-page document on Monday outlining strict new rules for the resumption of Serie A on June 20.
 The document specifies teams must go on and off the pitch at different times and limits the number of people in stadiums to 300, including players, staff and journalists.
 However, Italian media reports that the soccer federation could discuss at its next meeting a vastly reduced number of fans being permitted to attend.
 “It’s something I really wish for with all my heart,” federation president Gabriele Gravina said. “It’s unthinkable that in a stadium that can hold 60,000 there’s not space for a small percentage of fans with the necessary precautions.”
 The revised Serie A calendar is expected to be announced on Monday night. It was decided last week to resume with the four catch-up matches postponed when Italian sports shut down in March because of the coronavirus.
 There are 124 Serie A matches remaining, which will be played in 43 days. Most of them will take place at night, with the earliest ones kicking off at 5:15 p.m., because of the heat in the country, especially in July and August.

Sangwa simply questioned the qualifications of the judges in question based on constitutional criteria and wrote to the President not to appoint these judges. They were appointed nonetheless and Sangwa became the most frequent lawyer to the Constitutional Court, indicating he accepted the outcome of these appointments. Criticizing the decisions of the judiciary is part and parcel of the constitutional order in a country under the Rule of Law. The judiciary is fair game to criticize, including the decisions emanating therefrom in a reasonable stance. The judiciary, if unaccountable, results in wrongful convictions, unreasoned and unreasonable decisions, corruption, incompetence and so on. This is no secret. Former Chief Justice Lombe Cibesakunda revealed that there is corruption in the judiciary. She is quoted as so stating severally. Dr R. Majula in his book, The Impact of Corruption on Public Administration (2014 rev.) has a chapter on Judicial Corruption in Zambia, quoting Chief Justice Chibesakunda.

For good reasons therefore, the minister is bound, like the editor, to be worried that she is so viscerally hated, to the extent of calling for her head. Why not? How many people of her age have been privileged to occupy such a huge strategic ministry? What does she expect when her charge touches directly on jobs creation and the daily livelihood of millions of people, in a personal manner? At any rate, as a public officer, every action or inaction of the minister is fair game for public scrutiny, including, occasional insults or throwing of rotten tomatoes and eggs; the price you get to pay when you are being fed, by the poor tax-payer. To that extent, the rage of the enrolees will seem understandable. But is their logic justified. I doubt that.

MADISON — From his days growing up in Madison as neighbor to the Johnsons, time as a stick boy in the late 1970s and early 1980s, playing baseball and winning an NCAA title with Wisconsin hockey, his program support and inspiration, and his broadcasting work, Rob Andringa has long been the epitome of what it means to be a Badger.
 Generosity and support are part of the family’s DNA. From his parents Conrad and Phyllis’ support of the program, Rob and his brother Jeff’s contributions on and off the ice and through to his sisters and the current generation of the family, this legacy helps make the Andringa family special to Wisconsin athletics.
 He was honored this past spring with the Gramps O’Sheridan Award, given for extraordinary service to the UW hockey program and awarded only when an appropriate recipient comes along.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 1 (ANI): Equity benchmark indices moved up 2.5 per cent on Monday buoyed by the government's relaxation of curbs on most economic activities even though the COVID-19 lockdown in containment zones was extended till June 30.   Besides, the weather office retained its forecast for normal monsoon this year at 102 per cent of long-period average -- which will translate into higher rural incomes and hence elevated consumption levels.   At the closing bell, the BSE S&P Sensex was up by 879 points or 2.71 per cent at 33,304 while the Nifty 50 was 246 points or 2.57 per cent higher at 9,826.   All sectoral indices at the National Stock Exchange were in the green with Nifty PSU bank ticking up by 7.6 per cent, metal by 3.7 per cent, financial service by 3.3 per cent and auto by 3 per cent.   Among stocks, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv gained by 10.4 and 7.8 per cent respectively to emerge as clear winners of the day. Titan too gained handsomely with a jump of 7.7 per cent at Rs 958.50 per share.   Tata Steel moved up by 6.7 per cent and JSW Steel by 4.7 per cent while State Bank of India gained by 5.3 per cent and IndusInd Bank by 4.1 per cent.   Reliance Industries closed 3.7 per cent higher at Rs 1,520.45 per share. However, pharma majors Dr Reddy's, Cipla and Sun Pharma were in the red along with Bharti Infratel, Nestle India, Grasim and Hero MotoCorp.   Meanwhile, Asian shares pushed to three-month highs as progress on opening up economies helped offset jitters over riots in US cities and unease between Washington and Beijing.   Hong Kong's Hang Seng managed to rally 3.36 per cent while Japan's Nikkei added 0.84 per cent to also reach a three-month peak. South Korea's Kospi was up 1.75 per cent and Shanghai composite by 2.21 per cent. (ANI)

After some trial and error in finding a source, Riana Butler and I settled on profiling someone actively involved in the Cal Poly Cat Program (CPCP), the university’s nonprofit cat shelter. I had recently seen a CPCP Facebook post, and I began to wonder what was happening behind the scenes at the shelter. I had also come across an article from _The Tribune_ called “How does Cal Poly care for 10,000 campus animals during the COVID-19 shutdown?,” which was great, except for that it focused exclusively on livestock. Riana and I hoped that interviewing a volunteer staff member would not only lend the program some recognition, but also provide us with a really interesting subject matter.

That vote of consumer trust shows every sign of continuing for the foreseeable future – and that shouldn’t be a surprise, really. When milk is already in 94% of U.S. households, it follows that it would be especially important as families choose how to weather a storm. This real world, real-time affirmation of dairy’s value can’t help but inspire the entire dairy community to keep working and maintain resilience through whatever comes next. Dairy owes a deep debt of gratitude to consumers whose support has helped carry farmers through this crisis.
 Of course, consumer faith has been only one part of dairy’s story in the past few months. Pre-coronavirus, about half of all dairy sales came from outside the home. Even as retail consumers increased dairy buying, sales to restaurants, schools and cafeterias plunged. That turbulence prompted sharp declines in the USDA’s forecast for milk prices for 2020. That’s been a big reason why federal assistance for dairy farms has been so important.
 But even that story is brightening. A recent price rally is changing the outlook from mortifying to merely difficult – still cold comfort for many producers, but more manageable in a way many wouldn’t have dared to wish for even one month ago. Restaurant sales are slowly returning, and federal aid has provided a meaningful boost to bottom lines, even as signs of stress will still need to be monitored and additional aid will be necessary.
 The past few months have been difficult for dairy, as it has for everyone. The next few will be as well. But dairy is resilient. Its value to consumers is beyond dispute, and early signs of recovery give reasons for hope. June 1 is World Milk Day. there remains much to overcome, there is also much to celebrate. Raise a glass.

Now, you should know that I adore linen.
 It's cozy, cooling, keeps me from sweating through the night, and as I've said before, it ages as gracefully as Meryl Streep. But one of my greatest frustrations with linen sheets has been the lack of available options for deeper mattresses. They're the only kind of sheets I sleep on, which has forced me to make the trade-off of having the temperature regulating material I love with the constant bunching and corner flipping I'm deeply annoyed by. So many other sheets come in deep options -- why not linen?
 This is an issue MagicLinen addresses across the board. The company offers 18 different color and pattern options for their sheets, and with every size from Twin to King comes a "deep" option. I've been using these deep sheets for more than two years, and it has made all the difference on a bed that not only has a thick mattress but also a memory foam topper.
 As for the linen material itself, rest assured (pun intended) that MagicLinen knows what it's doing.
