Rooney is absolutely spot on here. Football must follow the government's advice on how to deal with the pandemic, but declaring the season 'null and void' is probably not a good idea. The current season will have to be completed after the Covid-19 subsides, and games to be played behind closed doors have been suggested.

Arsenal have been added to the growing list of potential suitors for Frankfurt defender Evan N’Dicka.
 The 20 year-old moved to the Bundesliga two summers ago in a £5 Million move from Auxerre, and has been a regular in the first-team playing squad.
 N’Dicka has picked up an impressive 42 league appearances already, being utilised as a left-back on occasion but more commonly in his favoured centre- back role, and is under the watchful eye of a number of clubs such as Liverpool, Valencia, Sevilla and both Milan clubs, who are paying close attention to his development.
 Mikel Arteta has made his intention clear in wanting a left-footed option at centre-back, similar to Pep Guardiola who has taken a shining to Aymeric Laporte as his main defender, a theory backed up by the arrival of Pablo Mari on loan this term.
 The Spanish defender has recently made his debut in our first-team, and has hit the ground running, but should Mari fail to earn a permanent move, N’Dicka could be another possibility.
 Our club currently has a number of defensive options, and it remains to be seen how many of the six centre-backs are in Mikel Arteta’s plans, although David Luiz is expected to have his contract extended as well as our club eagerly awaiting the arrival of William Saliba.
 Should we opt to make a move for the 6ft 4″ defender, we could field two of Europes hottest young defensive talents together on occasion, although I do believe Arteta rates Luiz as the key mainstay of our defence.
 Could we really bring in another centre-back this summer? Could both Mustafi and Sokratis need replacing?

The Fenmen sit bottom of the Northern Premier League South East Division but do not know when or if they will return to action again this season due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Brenchley feels the league would be wrong to finish the campaign now, and although uncertain times may lie ahead, the club will pull through.
 “I just don’t bear thinking about the fact that we could get relegated,” he said.
 “I don’t think they (the league) can relegate and promote people from as it stands because there would be a lot of lawsuits if they do.
 “I think we’re more fortunate than others because we’ve got no wages to pay. On the minor side, we’re not earning anything.
 “Off the field, I was doing things in the clubhouse and getting loads more bookings. But with the enforced break, all those paying deposits want their money back, so it hasn’t done us any favours.
 “On the field, the break probably has favoured us financially. It’s very difficult times, but we’ll get through it.”

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The Michigan Supreme Court is seeking public comment on a proposal to require annual education courses for judges. The court says the goal is to ensure proficiency about current law, integrity on the bench and administrative skills. Judges would be required to fulfill a minimum of 12 hours of continuing education each year. The program would be supervised by a Judicial Education Board with judges from different courts. Justice Richard Bernstein said ongoing education is a good goal. But he said he's concerned that a mandatory program would turn into a hardship for an “already burdened judiciary.” “We should respect the autonomy of individual judicial officers to choose for themselves; the government should not seek to intervene in these individual decisions,” Bernstein said. Justice Stephen Markman supports the effort to get public comment. But he raised many questions, including how education programs would be “neutral and even-handed in their influence upon substantive judicial perspectives.\"
