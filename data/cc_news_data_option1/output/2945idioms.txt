Showing impressive determination and pluck, de Havilland engineered her way out of her Warner Brothers contract so that she could act in _Gone With the Wind_ by going through studio head Jack Warner's wife. Warner eventually agreed to loan the actress out to David Selznick and MGM for the part of Melanie Hamilton. Interestingly, de Havilland had no interest in playing the lead role. After reading Margaret Mitchell's novel, she found herself responding to Hamilton's quiet strength and dignity. For her performance, de Havilland was nominated for her very first Oscar in the category of supporting actress.

"Demasiado hemos sufrido en España como para tener que enfrentar una oleada de rebrotes. Ya 208 focos nuevos de contagios, con un Gobierno que vuelve a estar desbordado o pasivo ante lo que está pasando. Han plan B, hay plan alternativo al cierre económico ruinoso de todo un país y al confinamiento que ha causado estragos en salud mental, salud física y en economía en todos los hogares españoles", ha aseverado.
 "EL MINISTRO DE SANIDAD ESTÁ DESAPARECIDO"
 Eso sí, Casado ha dicho que ese plan alternativo se tiene que "asumir ya", por lo que ha pedido a Sánchez "más humildad", "menos autobombo", "menos propagada" y "menos pasillos de aplausos". De hecho, ha acusado al ministro de Sanidad, Salvador Illa, de estar "desaparecido" en este momento, donde ha habido "un exceso de triunfalismo".
 "Hay que tener la humildad para apoyarse en quien sabe, para remar todos juntos y evitar que la pandemia vuelva a afectar muy negativamente a nuestro país", ha enfatizado, para añadir que así lo plantearán los presidentes autonómicos del PP en la Conferencia de Presidentes del próximo viernes.
 En concreto, Casado plantea modificar de manera urgente en "quince o veinte días", en el mes agosto, la Ley Orgánica sanitaria de 1986, que puede limitar derechos fundamentales y ya regula las "enfermedades contagiosas" en su artículo 1. A su entender, esa norma se puede "completar" para usarse sin acudir al estado de alarma de nuevo.
 Además, y con el fin de ser "muy garantista" para dar seguridad jurídica, Casado ha puesto encima de la mesa una modificación de la Ley de Jurisdicción Contencioso Administrativa para que cuando se dedica la "reclusión forzosa en un domicilio" o el "internamiento hospitalario forzoso de un enfermo".
 El presidente del PP ha afirmado que si partido está poniendo encima de la mesa un "plan B jurídico" porque quiere garantía de los derechos fundamentales pero al mismo tiempo "eficacia, rapidez, agilidad, seguridad y protección". "No encontraría ningún motivo para que el PSOE no se sentara con nosotros hoy mismo para tramitar este proyecto de ley de manera urgente", ha resaltado.

Most of the younger patients have a benign course of illness. Johnny Luna, 34, who lives in a two-bedroom apartment in the Boyle Heights section near downtown Los Angeles, got tested for COVID-19 in May after experiencing what felt like a mild asthma attack, with shortness of breath and fatigue.
 When he received a letter with a positive test result a week later, Luna was dumbfounded. He had no idea where he might have been exposed, since he, his partner and school-age daughter had followed public health recommendations to the letter.
 “I washed my hands until they were chapped and dried, and took all the suggested measures,” he said. “In fact, this was the only thing in my entire life that’s gotten me to stop biting my nails.”
 As cases mount, contact tracers are having less success getting COVID-19-positive patients to pick up the phone, said Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Contact tracers had been able to complete an interview with positive patients more than 70% of the time up until about three weeks ago, he said. Now, the rate is as low as 65%.
 “It could be that older individuals who traditionally use phones are more willing to answer phones, whereas younger people might communicate through texting and other means, so maybe they’re less likely to,” he said.
 To increase pickups, the department has asked telephone companies to label all calls from contact tracers as “LA Public Health” when they flash on a phone’s display. The department has convened focus groups among young adults to figure out ways to better communicate with them.

If they do not turn up on election day, then polling stations will be closed to the benefit of Trump who is already trying to delegitimise postal voting.

The plans of state-owned banks to raise capital from private sources will not be sufficient to mitigate anticipated risks unless supplemented with more capital support from the government, Fitch Ratings said on Monday.Several large state banks have recently announced plans to raise a total of USD 6 billion in fresh equity from the capital market.

It said a reduction in the state's majority shareholding in some of its banks may dent depositor confidence and potentially lead to negative rating action as their long-term ratings are anchored to state support.It may also reduce investor appetite at a time when government capital support has stuttered, and an acceleration in new coronavirus cases is hampering a meaningful economic recovery and increasing risks for banks' balance sheets.&quot;We believe the proposed stake sales will be very challenging in the current economic climate and in light of the potential capital shortfalls we calculate at the state banks in our stress test.

The Democrats’ strategy of assuming that Trump would self-destruct failed four years ago because, among other things, it created a vacuum of information that Trump filled with slanders about Hillary Clinton. But these advantages may matter less than they would in any other year because Trump’s real opponent is not Biden but the coronavirus – and his campaign is being crippled by his failure to bring the epidemic under control or convince Americans that its ravages are being exaggerated. At his renewed press briefings, he is visibly at sea as he spews out an endless list of ill-assorted actions by the federal government to combat the virus. His claims of world-beating American success sound dangerously deranged when set against graphs showing infections soaring past the four million mark and deaths rising above a thousand a day.

It was different, for sure.
 With no fans in attendance, generic crowd noise that basically just sounded like quiet murmuring was piped in so Minute Maid Park would not be completely silent. Also, there was the voice of the Astros’ public address announcer (Galveston’s own Bob Ford), the presence of mascot Orbit and Minute Maid Park’s train conductor Bobby Dynamite (a personal friend and, no, not his real last name) and the typical ballpark music being played.
 It was still quiet enough that every crack of the bat sounded amplified, and viewers could overhear player banter, which should be a fun aspect of this unusual season.
 MLB games won’t be quite as enjoyable without the pop of cheers whenever the home team rakes a big base hit or sits down the road team with a strikeout or without the chorus of jeers whenever an umpire blows a strike call.
 But I still enjoyed once again watching the Astros very much, and I’m sure I’m not alone.
 For the first time in my sports-watching life, I actually recorded a regular season game this weekend when I was unable to watch it live. Before the pandemic, my attitude was that if I missed a game, “Oh well, it’s a long season, I’ll catch the next one.”
 But I’ve missed watching sports so much that, now, I don’t want to miss a thing — to quote the smash hit Aerosmith song from the soundtrack of 1998 summer blockbuster “Armageddon.”

Tour operator TUI has cancelled all British holidays to mainland Spain from Monday until August 9, after the UK government's decision to require travellers returning from the country to quarantine.
 The newly-imposed rule to self-isolate, abruptly introduced at midnight Saturday hours after being announced, follows a surge in coronavirus cases in parts of Spain in recent weeks.
 Other major British airlines have so far held off cancelling flights to Spain.
 TUI, Britain's biggest tour operator, said its decision did not apply to the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands, where COVID-19 case numbers are markedly lower than in parts of mainland Spain.
 Meanwhile holidaymakers already in the country will still be able to take their original flight home.
 German-owned TUI said customers impacted by the cancellations would be able to receive a full refund or the option to rebook their holiday.
 The operator said it was in contact with Britain's Foreign Office "to understand" why the government has introduced quarantine measures for all of Spain, when its travel advice is less stringent for the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands.
 "We believe regional travel corridors need to be considered," it said in a statement.
 "The UK Government must work closely with the travel industry as this level of uncertainty and confusion is damaging for business and disappointing for those looking forward to a well-deserved break."
 \- 'Disappointed' -
 The UK decision requires people arriving from Spain, a popular holiday destination for many Britons, to self-isolate for two weeks.
 Struggling British airlines said they were maintaining their flights but "disappointed" by the move.
 "This is sadly yet another blow for British holidaymakers and cannot fail to have an impact on an already troubled aviation industry," British Airways said in a statement.
 EasyJet added it would operate its full schedule in the coming days but that customers who no longer wish to travel could transfer their flights without a change fee or receive a voucher for the value of their booking.
 "We are disappointed that the government has decided to impose a quarantine requirement for those travelling from the whole of Spain since the increased occurrence of coronavirus is regional rather than nationwide," the budget carrier said.
 The new quarantine measures has dismayed the tourism sector, which was aiming to recover some of its revenues during the peak summer weeks after being decimated by months of lockdown.
 Irish no-frills airline Ryanair said Monday it had nosedived into the red in its first quarter -- suffering a loss after taxation of 185 million euros ($216 million) -- due to the pandemic.
 Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the UK move was "the news the travel industry hoped would never happen".
 "It shows the clear risks to the travel industry that its recovery will not be a smooth ride," he added.
 "The government imposing restrictions puts a spanner in the works and effectively derails their strategy for clawing back some of the losses experienced earlier this year."
 Investors signalled their unease, with stocks in large operators in the sector down Monday morning on the London Stock Exchange.
 IAG, the parent company of British Airways, lost around 9 percent, while EasyJet was down 11.27 percent and TUI 11.10 percent, in trading up to 0940 GMT.
