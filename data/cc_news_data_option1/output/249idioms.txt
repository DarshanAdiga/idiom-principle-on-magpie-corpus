USD/CHF consolidates Friday's goodish intraday positive move. The prevalent cautious mood seemed to have capped the upside. The USD/CHF pair was seen oscillating in a narrow trading band below the 0.9700 mark on Monday and consolidated the previous session's goodish positive move. A combination of supporting factors helped the pair to gain some follow-through positive traction for the second consecutive session on Friday and build on the previous session's modest recovery from multi-month lows. Bulls seemed reluctant amid cautious mood The latest optimism over the long-awaited US- China phase one trade deal remained supportive of the recent risk-on rally across the global financial markets and continued weighing on the Swiss franc's perceived safe-haven status. On the other hand, the US dollar was underpinned by expectations that the US economy will continue to expand and reduced odds of any further interest rate cuts by the Fed, which provided an additional boost to the pair. The greenback managed to preserve its recent gains to monthly tops, albeit a slightly cautious mood - amid tensions in the Middle East and Libya - kept a lid on any further positive move amid relatively lighter turnover on the back of a holiday in the US. The US markets will remain closed on Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Day. Hence, the broader market risk sentiment might continue to play a key role in influencing the price action and produce some meaningful trading opportunities.

To offer The Doors’ keyboardist Ray Manzarek double duty relief of playing both keyboards and bass on their second album, Elektra producer Paul Rothchild suggested bringing in Doug Lubahn, the bassist from the Elektra band Green Light, for The Doors’ _Strange Days_ sessions in 1967. Ray welcomed him and called him “The Fifth Door.” Jim Morrison drove him to the studio each day. The Doors’ drummer John Densmore said that bass players and drummers were brothers and that Doug’s playing was solid and like a rock. The Doors’ guitarist Robby Krieger said that it was too bad that Doug didn’t permanently join the group when they asked him but admired his loyalty to the band Clear Light, who are most noted for the song “Mr. Blue,” an eerie Doors-like number. In addition to playing bass on The Doors’ 1967 Top 40 singles “People Are Strange” and “Love Me Two Times,” he also played on The Doors’ second No. 1 single, “Hello, I Love You” in 1968, and on the single “Wishful Sinful” the following year.

STORRS, Conn. (AP) — Freshman Anna Makurat has struggled with her confidence since arriving at UConn from Poland's top basketball league. The 19-year-old sharpshooter had been passing up open 3-pointers and hesitating with her decision making. But on a recent trip to Dallas, the Huskies took in a Mavericks game and Geno Auriemma had Makurat study Luka Doncic, who also came from Eastern Europe, is just a year older and is thriving under the pressure of the NBA. That seemed to click with Makurat. She scored a season- season 21 points on Sunday, helping No. 4 UConn to a 92-34 rout of Tulsa. “Today, she was trying to channel her inner Luka,” Auriemma quipped. “These last three or four games she's looked really really good,” he added. “She's getting more and more comfortable every day and finding spots on the floor where she can be successful. She feels better shooting the ball and she's getting better defensively.” Megan Walker scored 24 points and Crystal Dangerfield added 16 as the Huskies extended their American Athletic Conference winning streak to 127 games. Christyn Williams and Aubrey Griffin each chipped in with 11 points for UConn (16-1, 7-0), which has won all 109 regular-season conference games and all six AAC tournaments since the Big East split and UConn was left in the American. Makurat scored 16 of her points in the second half, finishing 8 of 12 from the floor and 4 of 7 from behind the arc. She said she's starting to get a handle on how to be successful on this level. “I just trust the process I think,” she said. “Just don't overthink stuff and play the game of basketball. It's started to work for me. I hope it's going to get better and better. I just want to stay confident.\" Addison Richards scored 11 points for Tulsa (5-13, 0-5),...

Rispetto a tale problematica è stato posto in evidenza quanto espresso dai coordinamenti nazionali dei sindacati nel diffidare l’Amministrazione ad attribuire, senza remunerazione, agli ex titolari delle predette posizioni, con atti dispositivi di delega di firma, sostanzialmente le funzioni proprie venute meno allo scadere dell’incarico. Ciò in quanto l’esercizio di fatto delle funzioni non retribuite contrasterebbe con le previsioni del Ccnl, attribuendo un compito aggiuntivo per il quale potrebbe essere richiesto comunque in sede legale l’emolumento equivalente per ingiustificato arricchimento dell’amministrazione. Ad oggi , si è constatato che, anche grazie alla posizione assunta dalle organizzazioni sindacali, dagli stessi ex titolari delle predette posizioni e dai lavoratori tutti, le due Direzioni provinciali dell’Umbria hanno deciso di non delegare ai citati ex titolari di posizioni la firma degli atti, riportando la delega in capo ai relativi Poer.

BOSTON -- As a regional transportation emission reduction pact has started to show cracks, Energy Secretary Kathleen Theoharides says the Baker administration is in "full-court press mode" to keep the coalition of eastern states together.
 Theoharides testified on Tuesday before a legislative committee considering carbon pricing proposals, including bills that would assess a fee on vehicle and home heating fuels and return some of the penalty revenues as rebates to residents.
 While her testimony focused on the array of policies the administration is pursuing to react to climate change, many lawmakers had questions for Theoharides about the future of the Transportation and Climate Initiative (TCI) in light of comments made by public officials in neighboring states.
 The regional cap-and-trade program is still in development, but Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire has already said he will not enter his state into a final program, and the governors of Vermont, Connecticut and Maine, as well as the speaker of the House in Rhode Island, have all raised concerns about potential costs to consumers.
 Theoharides acknowledged that TCI is the "centerpiece" of Baker's plan to reduce emissions from the transportation sector to meet the state's carbon reduction requirements.
 "We see states as being exactly in the position we expected them to be in, looking at all of the details, talking to their stakeholders and working toward that spring deadline," Theoharides told lawmakers.
 The TCI coalition by the spring expects to finalize the details of the program, including a cap on car and truck emissions that would reduce emissions by between 20% to 25%, and add between 5 cents and 17 cents to the price of a gallon of gas.
 State Sen. Michael Barrett, D-Lexington, and co-chairman of the Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy Committee, asked Theoharides what would happen if the coalition that began with 12 states and the District of Columbia fell apart.
 "I will give you the honest answer, which is that I'm fully committed to getting TCI done and I'm not looking at Plan Bs because I still believe we can get this done," Theoharides said.
 While Barrett acknowledged that a successful TCI would be ideal, he asked if Massachusetts could join with California or solicit other states outside the region to create a market for carbon allowances.
 "Not ideal but workable, right?" he asked.
 Theoharides said the program is being designed so that other states, or even Canada, could easily link up at a later date, but that was not under consideration at this time.
 "We are in full-court press mode to make sure Plan A gets done," she said.
 Theoharides announced at the hearing that emissions in 2017 were down 22.4% from 1990 levels, compared to 21.4% in 2016, and enough to keep the state on track to reach its legal requirement to lower emissions by 25% by 2020.
 "We are seeing some interesting trends in the data this year," she said. "One of the more interesting ones is that transportation emissions actually decreased slightly even though vehicle miles and population increased. We really think this is due to decreased fuel consumption from improving vehicle efficiency standards."
 Transportation emissions currently account for about 42% of the state's carbon emissions, up from 32% in 1990, she said.
 She said there was a "little uptick" in emissions from the building sector, noting more days that heat needed to be turned on in 2017 than in 2016.
 Since 2005, when greenhouse gas emissions were 2% above 1990 levels, the state has gradually lowered its greenhouse gas output.
 The steepest decline came between 2010 and 2012 when in those two years emissions fell 12% to 24% below 1990 levels, before coming back up slightly in 2013. The 2012 mark is the lowest emission level the state has achieved, according to the Department of Environmental Protection.
 Barrett suggested that the decommissioning of the Pilgrim nuclear power plant could cause emissions to tick back up, but Theoharides said the clean energy lost from Pilgrim would be counteracted by the closure of the coal-fired plant at Brayton Point.
 "Our projection shows us continuing to make progress and going beyond 25%," Theoharides said.
 Many lawmakers and environmental activists, including state Sen. Marc Pacheco, D-Taunton, are interested in seeing the Legislature ramp up its emission reduction requirements, and view carbon pricing as one way to do it.
 Pacheco has proposed using market-based programs like TCI to get the state to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
 "We can't wait. That's right. We can't wait any longer," Pacheco said, alluding to attendees who had packed into the hearing room carrying pieces of paper with a picture of the Earth and those words.
 "And I'm glad that the governor is not waiting and is taking the position to implement TCI, because we don't need a vote of the Legislature here to implement TCI. That was done in 2008. We have carbon pricing, without a vote," Pacheco said.
 The Global Warming Solutions Act of 2008 authorized the executive branch to enter into market-based agreements to reduce emissions from varying sectors.
 State Rep. Paul Tucker, D-Salem, argued, however, that TCI doesn't go as far as some of the other carbon pricing proposals filed in the Legislature this session.
 Tucker testified with state Rep. William Driscoll, D-Milton, and others on legislation that would put a price of $20 a ton on carbon dioxide emissions and return 70% of the fees collected to households and employers through rebates. The remaining 30% would be used to support clean transportation, climate resilience and renewable energy projects.
 "One of the points that can't be lost here is that TCI does not cover heating. It doesn't cover our buildings. It doesn't cover the industrial. It doesn't cover homes," Tucker said.
 While greatly outnumbered by supporters, state Rep. David DeCoste, R-Norwell, brought economist and Beacon Hill Institute Executive Director David Tuerck to testify against what Tuerck called the "very bad idea" of carbon pricing.
 Tuerck did a study for the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance that was released in July and found that the bill championed by Driscoll would cost the state more than 11,000 jobs and increase taxes on the average household by $755 in the first year.
 "It does nothing to improve the climate and it does a great deal to hurt the Massachusetts economy," Tuerck said.
 Tuerck said climate change must be addressed nationwide at the federal level and with other countries.
 Another panel of economists said Tuerck's research ignored benefits like improved health conditions and flew in the face of "mounting evidence to the contrary" in economics literature.
 "It's ignoring, among other things, what are you going to do with the revenue. It's just too simplistic," said Gil Metcalf, professor of economics at Tufts University and former deputy assistant secretary for energy at the U.S. Treasury.
 Metcalf said research has shown that carbon pricing alternatives, such as renewable portfolio standards and low-carbon fuel standards, cost more per ton of carbon removed.
 "The statewide fee on carbon emissions is where we should be, but if we can't do that participating in a transportation cap and trade system is a reasonable fallback as it would more than double and nearly triple the share of the commonwealth emissions subject to a carbon price," Metcalf said.
 Christopher Knittel, an MIT economist, said Massachusetts is "well-suited" for a carbon tax because its economy is driven by a lot of industries that aren't "energy dependent," and the fee would fall on commerce coming into the state.
 "You're taxing someone else's constituencies," Knittel said, drawing laughter from committee members and the audience.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday urged all States ruled by non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parties as well as the States in the Northeast which are ruled by the BJP not to participate in the National Population Register (NPR).
 “I will appeal to all the northeastern States along with Opposition-ruled States before taking any decision on NPR they must read the law properly. I will request them not to participate in it,” she told journalists at the Kolkata airport before taking a flight to north Bengal.
 Ms. Banerjee, who did not send a representative of her government to participate in a meeting called by the Centre on the NPR and the Census last week, described the “NPR as a dangerous exercise” and said that there were so many provisions in the NPR which are related to the National Register of Citizens ( NRC).
 Ms. Banerjee asked why columns of providing date of birth of parents should be there in the NPR form if they were not mandatory.
 “Suppose in the NPR there is a column saying that give your father’s date of birth or birth certificate or mother’s date of birth or birth certificate. But when the States raised objection .They (Centre) said it is not mandatory. If it is not mandatory then why it exists on paper,” she asked. Ms Banerjee said that people who could not fill such columns could be excluded.
 “So there are apprehensions. First they have to withdraw it. The NPR is a very dangerous game and it is totally related to the NRC,” the Chief Minister said.
 The Chief Minister said that her government had passed a resolution against the NRC in the Assembly and her government would pass another resolution on the CAA, which was now law, urging the Centre to withdraw it.
 On being asked about the meeting of Opposition parties, she said that Chief Ministers of Opposition parties could meet anywhere, including in Kolkata. “ It will depend on the time, now we have Saraswati Puja and Republic Day so everyone will be busy,” she said.

These tunes killed in the clubs and inspired us to try and write songs that were more commercial, but with an edge. We saw them in concert in L.A. and they played note for note on those great songs, with Ric sharing vocals with Ben and Elliot Easton on guitar. They rocked on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction last year as well.”

Wreaths will be placed at the town's Flood Memorial to commemorate the 67th anniversary of the 1953 east coast floods disaster. Mayor of Felixstowe Nick Barber said it was important to never forget the past and confirmed that an act of remembrance would take place at the Flood Memorial on Langer Road on January 31. Full details are expected to be released this week. The floods wreaked havoc after the sea surge burst through the banks of the River Orwell, tearing across Trimley Marshes and inundating the resort's low- lying West End area. Most who died lived in prefab houses at the corner of Langer Road and Orford Road, where the torrent ripped the properties from their foundations, sweeping them down the road and leaving them 6ft 6ins deep in water. Those who died included whole families - 13 of them children. The memorial is expected to be visited by many relatives on the anniversary to lay flowers and sit and reflect. A total of 307 people on the east coast died on January 31, 1953, as the surge, fuelled by a deep depression off the top of Scotland, funnelled down the North Sea, with 30,000-plus evacuated from their homes, sea defences smashed, river walls breached, and 160,000 acres of farmland under water. At Felixstowe, about 800 acres - one fifth of the town - was flooded, including homes and part of the air base where the port now stands. Higher ground on the seafront was unaffected and the Cavendish Hotel was used as a rescue centre. The cost of the floods nationally was estimated as up to £50million - about £1.1billion at today's prices.
