With upward of a trillion dollars to be spent over a period of ten years, boosting economic development in globalisation’s final frontiers, BRI was welcomed by many emerging markets with open arms. But now the proverbial chickens are coming home to roost, as in some markets Chinese investment has become a euphemism for wasteful spending, environmental destruction and untenable debt. Many major projects are currently strewn around the world in half-finished disrepair and the opportunities that were sold to local populations un-materialised. A number of projects have been marred by delays, financial implosions and occasionally violent outpourings of negative public sentiment.

A July boys lacrosse tournament for high school seniors who had watched their final MIAA season canceled before it ever got started sounded like a good idea.
 And it was.
 In the end, though, it got tossed onto the pile with all the other fun things that have been sacrificed to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Last week, the Eastern Mass. Lacrosse Coaches Association announced "with tremendous regret and sorrow" that it was pulling the plug on its upcoming 2020 Senior Classic event, which had drawn interest from more than 100 teams and 800-plus players, according to organizers. Silver Lake had put together a team to compete while Plymouth North and Plymouth South were scheduled to combine forces once again to field a team for the tournament.
 Boys lacrosse is in the "higher-risk" category of sports and, as such, is still prohibited by the just-released state guidelines for organized youth and adult amateur sports activities.
 "It's extremely disappointing, on so many levels, obviously," said Hingham coach John Todd, one of the organizers. "With the season being canceled, we were trying to do something for these 2020s to give them the ability to play together one last time as a team, for their town, so to speak. Just get out there and get after it, even though it was going to be a short little token of play. But as we see all the releases that are coming out [Wednesday about fall college sports getting canceled], it's one of those things that [the disruption caused by the virus] isn't going to go away.
 "It was going to be a great event," Todd added. "We worked hard to prepare it, given the current circumstances that we're dealing with. We thought we had a good window and everything was going to work out. Obviously, the enthusiasm from all of the schools and coaches was astronomical. We were so excited for that."
 "Lacrosse is a labor of love," said Dover-Sherborn coach Brian McLaughlin, another one of the organizers. "We enjoy what we do; that's why we do it. It was tough [to give it up], especially for the seniors not to be able to get a chance to play together [one last time]."
 McLaughlin said a lot of planning went into the event, which was conceived in late April, right after the MIAA Board of Directors voted unanimously to scrap the entire slate of spring sports.
 "We met quite a few times over Zoom and talked over some things," McLaughlin said. "We did do quite a bit of planning and had a mock schedule ready to go. The coaches were great at getting back to us and telling us how many kids they had [available]. Some teams didn't have enough for a team so we were combining some of the teams together. Some teams just got together on their own and said, 'Hey, we'll play together.'"
 McLaughlin's Dover-Sherborn team had only five seniors, so they were going to combine forces with Natick, where McLaughlin's son plays. "I was looking forward to watching him play one more time," the coach said.
 Todd said all 18 Hingham seniors were lined up to compete. That group included goalie George Egan, who was hoping to get in one last high school hurrah before heading off to the University of Vermont to play with his older brother Charlie.
 "Everyone was psyched to play one last time and get all the boys back together," Egan said. "There was some doubt that it would happen, but we had been practicing. Everyone was pretty bummed out. It was tough. That was going to be the last time we'd get to play together, and now we can't."
 Under the original plan, the Senior Classic would have started next weekend with a two-day, round-robin format that would pit EMass teams from all three divisions against one another. The semifinals and final would have been held the following weekend. Hopkinton High and Medway High were lined up as host sites, Todd said.
 Each team would have had a roster of at least 10 players, although only four or five field players and a goalie would play at a time.
 "I think it would have been good," McLaughlin said of the format. "Different type of lacrosse, more Olympic style with a little more half-field. Little more run-and-gun than some of us are used to, but I think it would have been a fun event to try."
 A statement posted to the EMLCA website said that players who registered for the tournament would be reimbursed through Paypal.
 Denied the opportunity to give his seniors a final, on-field send-off, McLaughlin said he was coming up with alternate, lower-key goodbyes.
 "I did send them a message through email and via text," he said. "I told them we'd probably get together outside somewhere and have a sandwich together, just to shoot the breeze and see what's going on."

So, seven years after the launch, how is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects ever conceived progressing? Beijing boasts that the official list of participants is up to 138, more than two thirds of the countries in the world. However, the open nature of BRI and the lack of precise definition of what it means have led to vaguely-worded MOUs between China and recipient countries, making it difficult to quantify the level of Chinese penetration. In the early days, BRI became an economic feeding frenzy, with a torrent of Chinese firms, both state-owned and private, flowing across Asia, Europe and Africa, recklessly spending hundreds of billions of dollars on development deals. Many projects were designed and implemented on the basis of a scattershot approach, leading to a spending spree of unprecedented proportions.

Brussels, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 19th Jul, 2020 ) :EU leaders wrangled over the size and rules of their huge post-coronavirus economic recovery plan Saturday, seeking to overcome fierce resistance from the Netherlands and its "frugal" friends in a second day of intense debate.
 European Council president Charles Michel proposed a fresh plan after his initial blueprint for a 750-billion-euro ($850 billion) package ran into stiff resistance from the richer northern member states.
 "There's a very tough battle in the offing," a senior diplomatic source told AFP, predicting the marathon talks would take at least 12 more hours, stretching into early Sunday and could then still fail.
 Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has insisted member states retain final approval of EU funding -- an effective veto -- for national recovery plans for the likes of Spain and Italy, whose economies were ravaged by the virus and its lockdowns.
 He says EU oversight is necessary to oblige countries to reform their labour markets to make them better able to cope with future crises.
 In a concession to Rutte's demands, Michel's new plan includes a "super emergency brake" that gives any country a three-day window to trigger a review by all member states of another's spending plans.
 An official from a non-frugal state insisted that this does not amount to a right of veto, but admitted that it remains to be seen whether countries such as Spain and Italy will accept the compromise.
 Meanwhile, a European source said the frugal countries were still not happy with the broader package and were seeking more cuts.
 "There are many more issues to solve but the proposal on governance as put forward by Michel is a serious step in the right direction," a Dutch diplomat said, but warned "many issues remain".
 \- Right of veto - Before talks with all 27 leaders restarted, Michel held a roundtable with Rutte, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Italian and Spanish PMs to test out his new proposal.

Brussels, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 19th Jul, 2020 ) :EU leaders were deadlocked over the size and rules of their huge post-coronavirus economic recovery plan Saturday, unable to overcome fierce resistance from the Netherlands and its "frugal" allies in a second day of intense debate.
 European Council president Charles Michel proposed a fresh plan after his initial blueprint for a 750-billion-euro ($850 billion) package ran into stiff resistance from the richer northern member states.
 "We're in a stalemate, it's very complicated, more complicated than expected," Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said after more than nine hours of wrangling in a second day of talks that some worried could go to a third.
 Europe is in the throes of a massive recession and leaders are trying to approve a plan that could quickly send cash to countries hit the hardest, but without the means to recharge their economies.
 But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has insisted member states retain final approval of any funding -- an effective veto -- for national recovery plans for recipients like Spain and Italy.

Since the start of Phase 2, the 22-year-old forward and the Flames' sixth- round selection in 2016 has been grouped with the team’s top NHL players and quietly proving himself as things shifted into Phase 3.
 Matthew Phillips has logged some serious time with the Calgary Flames this summer.
 Since the start of Phase 2, the 22-year-old forward and the Flames' sixth- round selection in 2016 has been grouped with the team's top National Hockey League players and quietly proving himself as things shifted into Phase 3.
 This week during training camp, he has been the last player to leave the ice among the team's first grouping of skaters -- a level of effort that doesn't go unnoticed by the coaching staff and, in the long run, could pay dividends for a guy who is still trying to make an impression.
 "He's an extremely hard worker," pointed out Flames head coach Geoff Ward. "You know he's giving you everything he's got every day, he's done a great job competing. We've noticed him every day."
 And that's a good thing.
 Apart from an early December call-up during the 2019-20 regular season, Phillips spent the campaign with the American Hockey League's Stockton Heat.
 He fractured his knee cap during AHL action on Dec. 28 and underwent surgery shortly after. Phillips played his first game back on Feb. 15 and skated nine more times with the Heat before the global outbreak of COVID-19 put everything on hold.
 At the time of his injury, he'd been scoring at a point per game clip in the AHL. He finished the season with 15 goals and 33 points in 38 games.
 When the NHL season was put on pause on March 12 and the Flames went their separate ways, it left only a handful of players in Calgary when Phase 2 began.
 That gave Phillips, a Calgary native, a chance to get some valuable ice time with NHL regulars such as Mark Giordano, Michael Stone, Tobias Rieder, Zac Rinaldo, Mark Jankowski, and Dillon Dube before Phase 3 began last Monday.
 "It's good," Phillips said. "It's weird to have a training camp in July, but I think it's been nice getting on the ice for the past month. The speed is pretty much what you'd expect at a normal training camp. The pace is high and very competitive. That being said, it's a smaller group than normal years but it's a lot of fun."
 Circumstances -- which the Flames would not elaborate on this week -- have forced a curious split of players into two groups.
 Phillips, along with AHLers Glenn Gawdin, Adam Ruzicka, Byron Froese, Alexander Yelesin and goalies Artyom Zagidulin and Jon Gillies, have been included in the first group which is the majority of their NHL roster.
 Unlike most NHL teams, which immediately split up their groups into their mainstay players and a taxi squad of reserve players, the Flames changed their plans.
 For Phillips, that meant a few more extra skates with Mark Giordano, TJ Brodie and others, which has been a very worthwhile experience.
 That being said, when it comes to battling for a spot in the upcoming play-in round against the Winnipeg Jets, Phillips knows he is in tough.
 "I don't know how much of an advantage it is (skating with the first group), because everyone is putting in the work," he said. "It's definitely very nice to not only be around the team and the regular NHLers and all that. But I get to do it all while I'm at home and spending time with family."
 It's a unique situation, no doubt, and one that wouldn't have presented itself if it weren't for the coronavirus flipping the entire NHL schedule upside down.
 But this opportunity has also given Ward a chance to familiarize himself with players such as Phillips, and see them on a daily basis over an extended period of time.
 Normally, during a training camp, the coaching staff would only have a few days of main camp before launching into an exhibition schedule and then the NHL's regular season.
 Phillips, by all accounts, is considered undersized at 5-foot-7 and 140 lb., but Ward has seen firsthand how that doesn't seem to stop the young up-and- coming right winger/centre.
 "I think with how quick he is combined with his compete level helps him get on top of people and it has allowed him to have an impact," Ward said. "As a smaller player, that's what he has to do; he has to be able to get around the feet of bigger players and take advantage of his quickness in tight. He can close up on places well. He's got a good stick, a good brain. He's got to use his quickness and his compete level in order to have an opportunity to make plays and he's certainly been doing that when he's had opportunities so far."
 There also could be potential opportunities as training camp wears on, ramping up to the Flames' exhibition game against the Edmonton Oilers on July 28 and the best-of-five play-in series against the Winnipeg Jets, which starts Aug. 1. Injury, of course, always presents chances for others to step in and step up. Derek Ryan, for example, has been absent this week while Mikael Backlund also missed some time with -- what we can only assume was -- an injury.
 "Everybody wants to make an impact in playoffs and that can be in a lot of different ways," Phillips said. "That can be 30 minutes a night or someone that gets slotted into the lineup for one game and has to play. Everyone has to have little things they're responsible for. Playoffs are a lot more physical and you usually see a lot more injuries around playoff time. So, it's very important for everyone, whether you're on the first line or coming up from Stockton, that you're ready to play and make an impact."

DECATUR – Neither heat, humidity or a pandemic was going to stop the USA Softball of Illinois tournament players.
 With temperatures in the low 90s and a heat index well over 100 degrees, the players forged on at Decatur's Rotary Park.
 “After the game's done, we're not supposed to shake hands,” said Justin Shull, coach for Decatur-based America's Misfits, whose uniforms were adorned with red, white and blue. “The umpires can't touch (the balls). But here, it's really not that different for me. Just go out there and play ball.”
 Some of the teams hadn't played together since before the shutdowns started in March, said Mike Tague of Mahomet, whose team, Vengeance, was America's Misfits' opponent early in the day. When the state's restrictions eased a few weeks ago, some schools allowed the team to use their fields for batting practice, but with no games and team members' homes widely scattered from each other, full practices haven't been possible, either.

The time is right to reset India’s China policy. Should it be tit for tat along LAC, gradually evicting China from Aksai Chin area or increasing activities along two SLOCs in the Indian Ocean which are lifelines for China’s energy security? Over 60% of China’s oil imports and 58% copper imports traverse through the chokepoints in the Indian Ocean Region. Both these are essential for China’s economic and military technology growth. Tibet and Taiwan are the two other sensitive issues for China which could be looked into. Strengthening the Quad as an economic and security architecture is another possibility. The inclusion of Australia in this year’s Malabar exercise could be indicative of this happening. Or is it time to hard negotiate with China and smoke the peace pipe for assured mutual growth? These are some of the complex strategic options which India has to deal with. These are tough options, but it’s time for strong political and diplomatic decisions that will keep India on the trajectory of economy growth and development.
