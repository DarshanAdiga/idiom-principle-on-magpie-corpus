Showers can be used, as long as individuals remain socially distanced.
 Sheffield United will not use the away dressing room at Villa Park and have instead been allocated a press room and players' lounge to change in.
 "We are changing in a big media room at Villa Park, not in the changing rooms and our players have to stay two metres apart when there is a break in play," Wilder said.
 At some stadiums, teams will use different tunnels. Where there is one tunnel, players and match officials will stagger their journeys to and from the pitch.
 Widespread disinfection will take place including of changing facilities, dugouts, matchballs, goalposts, corner flags and substitution boards.
 People other than players and coaching staff on team benches must wear face coverings.
 No handshakes When teams line up for the Premier League anthem, players will now stand in a staggered formation.
 The traditional handshakes between the two teams will no longer happen and there will also be no handshakes at the coin toss.
 Trainers' benches will be expanded to enable social distancing during matches.
 Players have been told to maintain distancing during goal celebrations. No spitting or nose-clearing is allowed and players will use their own water bottles.
 In the Bundesliga, Hertha Berlin defender Dedryck Boyata found himself in hot water last month after grabbing the face of team-mate Marko Grujic.

Patiala The Punjab government has failed to clear ₹76 crore dues owed to Punjabi University, Patiala, which is toiling hard to meet its committed expenses. The pending dues include ₹46 crore related to postmatric scholarship for scheduled caste (SC) students, ₹21 crore for the varsity's constituent colleges and ₹9 crore of the monthly grant.Amid the fund crunch, the university has failed to release salaries and pensions to its 5,800-odd present and former staffers for the month of May.Registrar Manjit Singh Nijjar says the university has again pressed upon social welfare and higher education departments for clearing the postmatric scholarship and constituent colleges funds at the earliest."The social welfare department has audited records of SC students a number of times, but still the funds have not been cleared. We can only request the government for early disbursal," he says, adding that the university is hopeful of receiving the monthly grant of ₹9 crore by the end of this week.The monthly salary budget of the university is pegged at ₹33 crore. However, the varsity's fiscal health is not in a good shape. As per budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the varsity expects an income of ₹380 crore, while the expenditure is pegged at ₹676 crore, leaving a massive ₹296-crore deficit.Meanwhile, the government has added to its miseries, as not a single penny of ₹46 crore funds under the postmatric scholarship scheme has been paid since 2015. This includes funds meant for its neighbourhood campuses and regional centres as well. Earlier, the inordinate delay was due to faulty records sent by various departments and regional centres. Even as an audit cleared the discrepancies in 2018, the funds are still awaited.Vice-chancellor BS Ghuman, on his part, says the university officials are working round the clock to arrange funds for monthly expenses.Despite repeated attempts, minister for social justice, empowerment and minorities Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Kirpa Shankar Saroj, additional chief secretary of the department, could not be reached for comment on postmatric scholarship scheme dues.

 “If anyone truly knows me, they know I am a very passionate person. I care about my family, friends, teammates, and people I don’t even know. I spoke out because I am emotionally drained and I’m tired of seeing stuff happening without results or consequences. I realize I have a platform to generate change and I am trying my best to use it accordingly.

(Gray News) - Struggling retailer The Children’s Place plans to close hundreds of stores in an effort to focus more on online sales.President and CEO Jane Eifers announced the company is targeting to close an additional 300 stores by the end of the 2021 fiscal year, and 200 of those closures are planned for the 2020 fiscal year. The Children’s Place currently has 920 locations.This comes as net sales decreased by more than 38% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily because of the store closures related to the COVID-19 outbreak.Online sales increased 300% in the first quarter as 95% of the company’s brick-and-mortar stores were closed. Only 61 locations were open in the U.S. and Canada as of June 8.Eifers said she hopes the transformation to an online strategy could keep the company in business, as only a quarter of its projected revenues will be based on its physical locations after shuttering nearly a third of its stores.“We believe that our strong digital foundation, coupled with the rapidly changing shopping patterns of our consumer, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our strong value proposition and our core, digital-savvy, millennial customer, will result in the continued acceleration of our digital revenue,” Eifers said.Copyright 2020 Gray Media Group, Inc.

 And the community has rallied around the family to support them. Their neighbors drop by, asking them about his well-being, their landlord told them they didn't need to pay rent. The day of her husband's most recent close call, district leaders and a health volunteer came to see him, to calm him down, acknowledge that he's suffering and reassure him that he's being taken care of. They took him to see the police commander, whom Pranee said her husband trusted. The commander assigned one of his officers to check in on Samart once a day and gave the family his personal number so they can call him if they need his help.
 Pranee tells Samart the two things she knows to be true: that his family loves him and it will get better one day.

The relays provide a diagnostic alarm for module failures and a process alarm for Line Fault Detect (LFD) and process alarms.
 The MTL4-DMR offers all these features, plus 16 relay contact outputs for process alarms from each channel via a 34-way ribbon cable connector, allowing connection to an external termination board.
 The configurable design of MTL SUM5 accommodates late changes. This reduces risk during project execution as modules can easily be reconfigured or added as necessary at any point during the build. Loop disconnect is integrated in every terminal, so loops can be easily isolated, which simplifies maintenance and keeps associated costs to a minimum.
 There are two options of field terminal assemblies (FTAs) - General Purpose FTAs for signal conditioning or pass-through installations and Intrinsically Safe (IS) FTAs for IS installations - which can easily be switched as the application requires.
 The surge protection module can simply be added as and when it is required on completion of the surge risk analysis, which is carried out during the detailed engineering stage. This enables plant managers to save upfront costs where surge requirements are not known.
 MTL SUM5 reduces the number of marshalling components by 65% compared to a standard solution. One MTL SUM5 universal ADIO isolator module supports the functionality provided by 20 different MTL4600 single channel modules, while the configurable parameters enable support for an even wider range of applications.
 The marshalling solution provides comprehensive diagnostics, notifying the process managers when action is required. It also features LED indicators for power, function and status, which simplifies commissioning and troubleshooting.
 The MTL SUM5 modules are designed for both cabinet mounting in the control room, or field mounting. They are designed for ambient operating temperatures from –40 to +70°C and for mounting in a Zone 2 hazardous area, thus providing reliable operation in remote locations.

 We’re in the aftermath of one such eruption now. We’re demanding that law enforcement officers who abuse, assault and even murder people in their custody be held to account. No person is above the law — especially those sworn to enforce it.
 Still, we continue to ignore another group of abusers who hold themselves to be above the law; those nobody dare touch. These are men and women of the collar and the cloth. These are the preacher-predators, the sectarian pedophiles who sexually abuse and forever ruin the lives and psyches of their child victims.

 While Donald Trump has given a green light to Netanyahu to consider annexation, Joe Biden has publicly disagreed with this for he feels it would undermine any chances for a two-state solution which is critical for both the Palestinians and the Israelis. Biden, like I, feel that the rights of the Palestinians cannot be overlooked and disregarded. Unilateral action by Israel would be very harmful to that process.

Sacked CEO Kevin Roberts alone is not responsible for Cricket Australia's financial woes and culpability of the Board also needs to be fixed, says the legendary Allan Border.
 Roberts resigned on Tuesday and was replaced by T20 World Cup chief executive Nick Hockley in an interim role amid the financial crisis the body is facing in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Border was flabbergasted how Cricket Australia got to the situation where it had to stand down around 80 per cent of its staff, saying that the sword should not fall on just one head.
 "You can't just lump it all on Kevin Roberts. Surely there's other people, particularly the directors of the Australian cricket board. Where's their culpability in all of this?," the former Australian skipper told Fox Sports News. "It was only a couple of years ago we had a couple hundred million dollars in the bank, then all of a sudden we're broke by August this year?" The former batsman said he just couldn't understand how the governing body reached this stage.
 "I just can't quite work it out. We're in off-season as a sport, and all of a sudden we're losing money hand over fist from a very strong position just a couple of years ago. I just can't work out where all the money's gone," he said.
 Border said Cricket Australia would have a lot of money from broadcast deals and that should have secured them. "There's a huge television rights deal. That should be enough to cover expenses, surely, from year to year. To me it just doesn't ring true that you can be in such a strong position one minute (and then this).
 "So at the end of last season where were we at financially, and the start of next season hasn't happened yet - so what's happened in the meantime apart from sacking lots of people? Where's the money gone?" The 64-year-old said other officials who were involved in decision making also need to be made accountable.
 "Kevin Roberts has been the CEO through that time … (but) some of the directors have got to be squirming at the moment. At the end of the day they sign off all those financial decisions.
 "It's not just the CEO. There's got to be some others that fall on their sword as well."

“I like seeing all my teammates put in all this hard work after the long break,” Ramirez said after his group finished working out Monday. “I just want to see them shine.”
 Monday marked an indoor, weight room-only day for the Raiders. The team is holding four workouts per week — two indoors and two on the practice field for conditioning.
 After using most of the morning lifting weights, the Raiders finished off the workout by dropping to the floor for some push-ups, crunches and other body- weight exercises. After gathering around Murray for some quick thoughts and a reminder about Tuesday’s workout, the group is dismissed. Another group of less than 20 is set to begin 30 minutes later.
 It’s the first year on the head job for Murray, who has been on staff at Southeast for 16 years, most recently as offensive coordinator under former head coach Sean Gray, who stepped down after the 2019 season.
 With all the uncertainty brought to his first offseason by COVID-19, Murray is glad to be back with his team in any capacity.
 “I’m still learning a lot of the freshmen, and some of them I know and they’re in other groups,” Murray said. “Hopefully in a couple of weeks we’ll actually be able to get out on the field with a ball.”
 Murray takes over a team that finished 0-10 last season. The Raiders are set to play a non-region schedule in 2020, meaning Southeast won’t have a shot at the playoffs.
 That winless season helps fuel Ramirez during offseason workouts, he said. A freshman on last year’s team, Ramirez says he hopes a strong offseason can lead to an improved season.
 “What we’re doing now, it’ll help us in the season,” Ramirez said. “We’re just trying to get better and win some games.”

The Jammu and Kashmir high court on Tuesday quashed the detention of National Conference general secretary Ali Mohammad Sagar under the Public Safety Act, his lawyer and party leaders said on Tuesday.
 Sagar was detained along with dozens of other leaders on August 5 when J&K's special status was revoked by the Centre and the region was split into two Union territories.
 The NC leader's counsel Shariq Reyaz and his son Salman Sagar confirmed that the high court has quashed the preventive detention order. "Extremely happy to let all of you know that the PSA against Sagar sahab has been quashed by the J&K high court after the court proceedings which took six hearings," Salam Sagar said.
 NC president Omar Abdullah tweeted: "The J&K high court has quashed the detention of my senior colleague @JKNC_ General Secretary Ali Mohd Sagar. Thankfully he challenged his detention even when those around him were reluctant to. This once again highlights the unjust and indefensible nature of the August 5 detentions."
   
   
 Sagar, who has served as law, parliamentary affairs as well as rural development minister in J&K assembly, spent these 10 months in three temporary sub-jails--Centaur Hotel, MLA Hostel and finally at M5 government quarters on Gupkar Road. He was shifted to Gupkar in the first week of February after he was booked under the PSA following completion of his six months detention under preventive custody.
 On June 3, the J&K administration had revoked the PSA against bureaucrat- turned-politician Shah Faesal and two leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Sartaj Madani and Peer Mansoor. However, Faesal was put under house detention immediately after his release.
 Now, only three prominent leaders are under detention, including former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti and former ministers Nayeem Akthar from PDP and Hilal Akbar Lone, son of senior NC leader and sitting MP Mohammad Akbar Lone.
 Buoyed by the court judgment, Omar Abdullah urged Mehbooba Mufti to approach the Supreme Court. "I hope @MehboobaMufti's legal team take heart from today's judgement in the J&K high court quashing Sagar Sb's PSA detention to pursue Ms Mufti's case in the Supreme Court with increased determination and vigour. She deserves to be freed without further loss of time," he said in another tweet.
 "Although Nayeem Sb & Hilal haven't challenged their detentions in court, I hope the authorities see the writing on the wall and realise their continued PSA detention is indefensible. They must be released as must all others under illegal 'house arrest'," he added.

Congress adjourned in early March 1865 and would not reconvene until early December. After Lincoln’s death in April, vice president Andrew Johnson became US president and had nine months without oversight to “restore” the nation. A border state Democrat, Johnson wanted to recreate the antebellum status quo, without slavery. Democrats would, he believed, rally to him and retake the country, running it much as they had before the civil war. There would be no new voices and, once he restored the Union and gutted the government’s wartime apparatus, no national taxes.

Southern legislatures did as he asked. Then they reflected the spirit of Johnson’s plan by circumscribing the lives of freed people. ‘Black Codes’ bound black workers to white employers, restricted their movements, and kept African-Americans from owning property or testifying in court. Southerners then re-elected to Congress a raft of ex-Confederates, including Alexander Stephens, the vice president of the Confederacy. Under Johnson’s policies, the postwar south looked much like the antebellum south.

Hours after the Indian Army said on Tuesday that an officer and two men were killed in a clash with Chinese soldiers in Ladakh's Galwan Valley, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh urged the Centre to take "some stringent measures" to stop Chinese belligerence.
 "It is time now for the Govt of India to take some stringent measures. Each sign of weakness on our part makes the Chinese reaction more belligerent. I join the nation in paying tribute to our brave martyrs. The nation stands with you in your hour of grief," Captain Amarinder tweeted.
 A former soldier, the chief minister said it is time now for the country to stand up to Chinese incursions.
 "The happening in the #Galwanvalley is a continuation of violations by China. It is time now that the country stands up to these incursions. Our soldiers are not fair game that every few days officers and men are being killed and injured defending our borders," he said in another tweet.
   
   
 Separately, the Congress has described the death of Indian soldiers in eastern Ladakh as shocking, unbelievable and unacceptable.
 The party also said the government must come forward to explain the circumstances of the latest development.

The Punjab government has failed to clear ₹76 crore dues owed to Punjabi University, Patiala, which is toiling hard to meet its committed expenses.
 The pending dues include ₹46 crore related to postmatric scholarship for scheduled caste (SC) students, ₹21 crore for the varsity's constituent colleges and ₹9 crore of the monthly grant.
 Amid the fund crunch, the university has failed to release salaries and pensions to its 5,800-odd present and former staffers for the month of May.
 Registrar Manjit Singh Nijjar says the university has again pressed upon social welfare and higher education departments for clearing the postmatric scholarship and constituent colleges funds at the earliest.
 "The social welfare department has audited records of SC students a number of times, but still the funds have not been cleared. We can only request the government for early disbursal," he says, adding that the university is hopeful of receiving the monthly grant of ₹9 crore by the end of this week.
 The monthly salary budget of the university is pegged at ₹33 crore. However, the varsity's fiscal health is not in a good shape. As per budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the varsity expects an income of ₹380 crore, while the expenditure is pegged at ₹676 crore, leaving a massive ₹296-crore deficit.
 Meanwhile, the government has added to its miseries, as not a single penny of ₹46 crore funds under the postmatric scholarship scheme has been paid since 2015. This includes funds meant for its neighbourhood campuses and regional centres as well.
 Earlier, the inordinate delay was due to faulty records sent by various departments and regional centres. Even as an audit cleared the discrepancies in 2018, the funds are still awaited.
 Vice-chancellor BS Ghuman, on his part, says the university officials are working round the clock to arrange funds for monthly expenses.
 Despite repeated attempts, minister for social justice, empowerment and minorities Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Kirpa Shankar Saroj, additional chief secretary of the department, could not be reached for comment on postmatric scholarship scheme dues.

Sacked CEO Kevin Roberts alone is not responsible for Cricket Australia's financial woes and culpability of the Board also needs to be fixed, says the legendary Allan Border.
 Roberts resigned on Tuesday and was replaced by T20 World Cup chief executive Nick Hockley in an interim role amid the financial crisis the body is facing in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Border was flabbergasted how Cricket Australia got to the situation where it had to stand down around 80 per cent of its staff, saying that the sword should not fall on just one head.
 "You can't just lump it all on Kevin Roberts. Surely there's other people, particularly the directors of the Australian cricket board. Where's their culpability in all of this?," the former Australian skipper told Fox Sports News. "It was only a couple of years ago we had a couple hundred million dollars in the bank, then all of a sudden we're broke by August this year?" The former batsman said he just couldn't understand how the governing body reached this stage.
   
   
 "I just can't quite work it out. We're in off-season as a sport, and all of a sudden we're losing money hand over fist from a very strong position just a couple of years ago. I just can't work out where all the money's gone," he said.
 Border said Cricket Australia would have a lot of money from broadcast deals and that should have secured them. "There's a huge television rights deal. That should be enough to cover expenses, surely, from year to year. To me it just doesn't ring true that you can be in such a strong position one minute (and then this).
 "So at the end of last season where were we at financially, and the start of next season hasn't happened yet - so what's happened in the meantime apart from sacking lots of people? Where's the money gone?" The 64-year-old said other officials who were involved in decision making also need to be made accountable.
 "Kevin Roberts has been the CEO through that time … (but) some of the directors have got to be squirming at the moment. At the end of the day they sign off all those financial decisions.
 "It's not just the CEO. There's got to be some others that fall on their sword as well."
