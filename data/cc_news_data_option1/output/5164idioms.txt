Being at sea is romantic. Perhaps it's the swaying motion, the fresh salt air, or simply the fact you're away and free. Stealing kisses comes naturally. Out on deck on a sultry night in the Caribbean, I started salsa dancing with a fellow writer who would later become my second husband. We married on a Princess Cruises "Love Boat" off the Bahamas and honeymooned while sailing from Singapore to Bali on Crystal Cruises.

RUSTON, LOUISIANA — Travis Lee DeFreese, of Ruston, LA, passed away Sunday, December 13, 2020 following a long illness.
 Travis was born August 4, 1931 in West Monroe, Louisiana and attended Claiborne and Crosley Grammar Schools. In 1950, he graduated from Ouachita Parish High School in Monroe, part of the first class to complete 12 grades. When the new OPHS opened, he was one of ten chosen to personify outstanding students from all previous student bodies.
 Mr. DeFreese received a BS in Electrical Engineering from Louisiana Tech University in 1954. At Tech, he was in AFROTC, served as Student Body President, President of the Sophomore, and Junior Classes, and President of Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
 After graduation, he joined a General Electric training program in Utica, NY and Fort Wayne, IN before entering the US Air Force in 1954. He served two years at Myrtle Beach AFB in South Carolina as a radar maintenance officer. Upon discharge, Travis began his career as a Junior Engineer with Southern Bell Telephone Company in Shreveport, LA. (He planned to spend the rest of his life in the south where it was warm.)
 After transferring to New Orleans, he was selected as one of five engineers from Southern Bell to attend an Operational Education and Training Program at the prestigious Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ for 18 months. He co-authored an Engineering paper which was presented at the IEEE Convention in New York City. Later, Travis was assigned to AT&T in NYC for two years where he handled government communications and emergency reporting systems. He also worked on special communications in the White House and served as a member of the Public Fire Service Communications for NYC.
 After two years, he returned to Louisiana, serving as District Plant Manager for South Central Bell in Shreveport and later the Lafayette District, before transferring to Alabama as Birmingham District Manager and then N. Alabama District Manager for Bell South in Decatur, Alabama. In 1993, he retired from the phone company and settled in Ruston, LA to be near family.
 Mr. DeFreese’s life was dedicated to public service. Wherever he lived, he was active in the community, serving in the Jaycees, Kiwanis, and always in the Methodist church, participating fully. Travis was willing to do whatever needed doing. Serving others was his creed and no job was too insignificant for him to do cheerfully. In Decatur, he was active at Central Methodist Church and in Kiwanis and United Way.
 Arriving in Ruston, Mr. DeFreese was a loyal Sunday School and choir member at Trinity United Methodist Church. He chaired the Building Committee for two additions. He participated in Friends of the Library, received Kiwanis Club awards and was actively involved with the renovation of Dixie Center for the Arts. He received the Russ Award (Outstanding citizen) in 2000. He was a founding member of the Louisiana Tech Foundation Board and a long-time member of the Ruston Planning and Zoning Board, serving several terms as Chairperson. As Travis liked to say, his life was built on a stable chair, a foundation with four legs: church/God, family, work, and community.
 Travis is preceded in death by his parents, Marvin and Azalea Shaw DeFreese, long-time West Monroe residents; sister, Virginia Simmons and brother, Ragan C. DeFreese.
 Left behind to cherish his memory are his wife, Clydia “Kitty” DeFreese; daughters, Stephanie Walker (James) of Brewton, Alabama and Laura McKinney (Richard) of Ruston, Louisiana and son, Craig DeFreese (Alice) of Decatur, Alabama; grandchildren, Leigh Walker of Birmingham, Alabama, Gavin McKinney (Nina) of Birmingham, Alabama, Brady McKinney(Bailey) of Ruston, Louisiana, and Courtney McKinney of Nashville, Tennessee, and great-granddaughter, Celia Macrae Walker of Birmingham, Alabama. He is also survived by two nephews and two nieces and their families, all of whom he treasured.
 A private graveside service will be held at Kilpatrick Cemetery, West Monroe, on Thursday, December 17.
 In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to Louisiana Tech Foundation, Travis and Clydia DeFreese Scholarship Fund, P.O. Box 3183, Ruston, LA 71272.

WASHINGTON — Hundreds more hospitals around the country began dispensing COVID-19 shots to their workers in a rapid expansion of the U.S. vaccination drive Tuesday, while a second vaccine moved to the cusp of government authorization.
 A day after the rollout of Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus shots, the Food and Drug Administration said its preliminary analysis confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health. A panel of outside experts is expected to recommend the formula on Thursday, with the FDA's green light coming soon thereafter.
 The Moderna vaccine uses the same technology as Pfizer-BioNTech's and showed similarly strong protection against COVID-19 but is easier to handle because it does not need to be kept in the deep freeze at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Another weapon against the outbreak can't come soon enough: The number of dead in the U.S. passed a staggering 300,000 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University, with about 2,400 people now dying per day on average.
 The devastating toll is only expected to grow in the coming weeks, fueled by travel over Christmas and New Year's, family gatherings and lax adherence to mask-wearing and other precautions.
 Packed in dry ice, shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine began arriving Tuesday at more than 400 additional hospitals and other distribution sites.
 The first 3 million shots are being strictly rationed to front-line health workers and nursing home patients, with hundreds of millions more shots needed over the coming months to protect most Americans.
 The rollout provided a measure of encouragement to exhausted doctors, nurses and other hospital staffers around the country.
 Maritza Beniquez has had a front-row seat to the devastation the COVID-19 pandemic has wrought on communities of color in New Jersey, so she jumped at the chance to take the vaccine that is being hailed as a turning point in the long and grueling battle against the virus.
 The 56-year-old emergency room nurse at Newark’s University Hospital became the first person in New Jersey to receive the vaccine on Tuesday. All recipients will get a second shot a few weeks later.
 “I’m happy that in another month and a half I won’t have to be afraid to go into a room anymore. I won’t have to be afraid to perform chest compressions or be present when they’re intubating a patient,” Beniquez said. “I don’t want to be afraid anymore, and I don’t want to have that risk of taking it home to my own family and my own friends.”
 Widespread acceptance of the vaccine is critical to eventually protecting enough of the U.S. population to defeat the outbreak. But just half of Americans say they want to get vaccinated, while about a quarter don’t and the rest are unsure, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Health Research.
 In Manchester, New Hampshire, intensive care unit nurse Heidi Kukla said she volunteered to get the shot first to help dispel fears about the vaccine's long-term effects and the speed with which it was developed.
 “I know a lot of people have reservations about getting the vaccine,” she said after getting vaccinated at Elliot Hospital. “But I can assure you that there is absolutely nothing worse than being a patient on a ventilator in an ICU anywhere in this country right now with COVID.”
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, urged elected officials to “step up” and get vaccinated.
 “We really need to get the country vaccinated,” he said. “It’s the right thing to do for yourself, for your family and for the country.”
 The federal government is planning hundreds more shipments through the weekend.
 Shots for nursing home residents won’t start in most states until next week, when some 1,100 facilities are set to begin vaccinations. Government officials project that 20 million Americans will be able to get their first shots by the end of December, and 30 million more in January.
 That projection assumes swift authorization of the Moderna vaccine, which also requires two shots for full protection. The U.S. government has purchased 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and orders for 200 million doses of the Moderna serum. Assuming no manufacturing or distribution delays, that would be enough to vaccinate 150 million Americans by mid-2021.
 In scrutinizing early results of a 30,000-person study, the FDA found that Moderna's vaccine worked just about the same as Pfizer-BioNTech's.
 The Moderna vaccine was more than 94% effective overall at preventing COVID-19 illness, and 86% effective in people 65 and older. The FDA uncovered no major safety problems. Side effects can include fever, fatigue and aches as the vaccine revs up the immune system.
 Even such a large study can’t detect very rare problems. But the FDA looked carefully for signs of allergic reactions after Britain last week reported some possible reactions among people with a history of severe allergies who received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.
 The FDA found no serious allergic reactions in the Moderna study. About 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% who got dummy shots reported possible smaller, “hypersensitivity” reactions.
 Both Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech's shots are so-called mRNA vaccines. They aren’t made with the coronavirus itself, meaning there is no chance anyone could catch it from the shots. Instead, the vaccine contains a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus.
