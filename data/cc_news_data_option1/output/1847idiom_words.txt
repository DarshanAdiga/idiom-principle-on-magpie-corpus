Freddy Daruwala is a fitness enthusiast and makes sure that he gives a decent amount of time from his routine to his workout. The actor not only lifts weights in the gym to build his muscles, but also engages in other activities like kickboxing and other aerobic exercises. The _Holiday_ actor does rope skipping exercise every day, which is the secret behind his lean physique and chiselled core. The Bollywood actor also believes that it is not about how much weight you lift, but about how you perform neatly with proper form that works on muscle. Freddy does weight training regularly where he focuses on each and every muscle group to maintain his aesthetic look. Also, he loves doing pull-ups exercises which have helped him develop a muscular back.
