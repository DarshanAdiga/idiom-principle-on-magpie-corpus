Professional sport is on the cusp of re-emerging in Australia albeit without crowds – most likely for the rest of the year.

DETECTIVES have charged a 25-year-old woman after a man was allegedly stabbed and had a gun pointed at him on Monday.
 Police will allege a 41-year-old man entered a black BMW 320i occupied by a man and woman known to him at Kiamba about 4pm.
 The three got out of the vehicle on Upper Hutton Road in Kiamba, and it’s alleged the driver threatened the man, pointing a gun at him.
 Police will allege a short scuffle ensued, before the firearm went off and the driver allegedly stabbed the man in the left arm with a knife.
 It’s also alleged the pair stole the man’s phone, watch and other personal items before they fled in the BMW.
 A 25-year-old Bellmere woman has been charged with deprivation of liberty, acts intended to maim, wounding, robbery in company while armed, assault occasioning bodily harm while armed and unlawful possession of a weapon.
 She is due to appear in the Maroochydore Magistrates Court tomorrow.
 Police continue the appeal for the boy (pictured), who is understood to have been travelling in the black BMW.
 The car was located by police at Alexandra Headland on Tuesday.
 He is described as caucasian, around 180cm tall, of an average build with black hair and brown eyes.
 Anyone who may have seen the boy is urged not to approach him and contact police.

If there’s one thing Catherine Pugh’s mayoral tenure and subsequent criminal conviction should have taught us, it’s that there’s no such thing as a “safe” choice in this city. So let’s aim high.
 It’s time Baltimore had a visionary leader who lives and breathes the city, and knows it like the back of his hand; someone who will work tirelessly to improve it and who isn’t afraid to upset the apple cart if it’s for the greater good. That’s why we endorse Brandon Scott to be the next mayor of Baltimore.

Officers moved through the group, telling people such gatherings were in breach of the government’s orders, and instructing them to leave the area.
 At one point a woman asked “is CoVID-19 real” – to which the officer replied “it is real” and stressed how the killer virus had already claimed thousands of lives across the country.
 The crowd took on board the advice and dispersed; there was no disorder and no arrests.
 Birmingham Police Superintendent Gareth Morris, said: “This gathering was unacceptable. It was, in essence, a large street party. Such gatherings are banned at present under CoVID-19 regulations as they pose a very real risk of spreading the virus and costing lives.
 “It’s important people take responsibility for their own actions to help curb the spread of the virus. There were several children in this gathering… parents need to be stressing to their children the importance of social distancing to save lives.
 “We don’t like stopping people having fun…but everyone has to recognise amassing in large numbers like this, given the current pandemic, is out of order.

I’m doing okay. Don’t worry about me. But to be honest, I think I’ve kind of reached the end of this tour. It’s been two years since I left you, but after all the countries, the faces, all the conversations and continents, the cities, the jungles, the monks, the artists, the addicts, the aquamarine waters and the cobalt green forests; I’m just about ready to call it quits. So it’s funny that somehow the world has conspired to find a way to maroon me here in this town, right at the end of my journey: just at the moment when I want to go home.

The second is more subtle; polarize opinions so much that there can be no middle ground, as this provides a crack into which you can insert a lever at a later date. It's a well known strategy that dates back some time - "divide and conquer", perhaps you've heard of it? Historically, there was a lot more "crossing of the aisle" for many votes in both the US and UK political systems. Today, it's party lines pretty much every single time, and both sides are deeply distrustful of more centrist candidates. Some of that is absolutely down to just normal political shifting sands; Blair and Cameron were both fairly moderate, Corbyn and May/Johnson much further to the left and right respectively, but that too only gives the bot herders more fodder to divide, and maybe even conquer.
