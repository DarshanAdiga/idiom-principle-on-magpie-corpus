President Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis is a blessing in disguise, because it has given him one last chance to win over millions of reluctant voters who approve of his policies but not of him. His illness has created a moment of sympathy, and with it an unexpected opportunity for a reset. He needs to seize that moment by offering the American people a clear vision for how he will end this pandemic. He may not take this advice, but whether he does may well determine whether Americans give him a second term.
 As soon as his health permits, the president should deliver an address to the nation on his recovery and the way forward in the battle against the virus. He should begin by thanking Joe Biden for his graciousness during this difficult moment and talk about how moved he was by the prayers of millions of Americans — including many who do not support him — for his and the first lady's recovery. He should discuss his experience fighting COVID-19 in deeply personal terms and express his empathy and solidarity with the millions of Americans who have struggled with it. He should say that, just as he beat this virus, so will America — and then lay out his vision for how we will do so.
 Rather than re-litigate the past, he should offer a hopeful vision for the future by focusing on the one initiative that will allow us to defeat COVID-19 once and for all — Operation Warp Speed. Trump can remind Americans that in May he launched "a massive scientific, industrial, and logistical endeavor unlike anything our country has seen since the Manhattan Project" — marshaling the resources of private industry, our public health agencies and the Defense Department to speed the development, manufacture and distribution of vaccines and therapeutics for the novel coronavirus and COVID-19.
 He should say that when he launched this initiative, he had no idea it would one day help save his own life. When he became sick, doctors gave him one of the therapeutics developed under Operation Warp Speed — an experimental antibody drug created by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that infuses lab-generated antibodies into the body to boost the body's immune defense rather than waiting for it to muster its own. Without it, he may have suffered a far more serious illness.
 In July, his administration announced a $450 million project under Operation Warp Speed to scale up manufacturing of Regeneron's drug so that we have as many as 300,000 treatment doses available as soon as it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And this is just one example of how his administration is speeding development of therapeutics and vaccines that will speed our nation's recovery. Since May, the federal government has invested about $10 billion in eight vaccine candidates, several of which are on track to complete Phase 3 trials by the end of the year or early 2021. Vaccines almost always take at least five years to develop; Operation Warp Speed will have done it in a matter of months.
 Trump should say that he understands some have questions about the safety of vaccines and therapeutics being developed under Operation Warp Speed, but that he can offer no better proof of their safety than taking them himself. He should say he took Regeneron's experimental treatment and will do the same when the first vaccine becomes available.
 He should then pivot to the progress we have made on the economy. In the past four months, we have added more than 11 million jobs, and third-quarter economic growth is likely to break all previous records. The United States, he should say, is ready to get back to normal — and that return to normal is now within our reach. The day is coming, sooner than most imagine, when we will be able to hug our grandparents again, go back to work and school, and return to our previous lives. He has a clear plan to get us to that day.
 He should then take this message into the next debate. He should thank Biden for his prayers and not interrupt, mock or belittle his opponent. Let Biden be the first to attack. He will say that it should not have taken the president getting sick for him to take the virus seriously. Trump should answer calmly that he has taken it seriously, as evidenced by Operation Warp Speed, but that he now understands the virus in a way no one who has not gone through it ever can.
 In the wake of his illness, Trump's devoted base will rally around him. But if he handles it right, the rest of the country could rally around him, too.

MONROE CITY, Mo. — The Monroe City football team ended two weeks of frustration with a 26-12 win over the Brookfield Bulldogs on Friday night at Lankford Field.
 After being blanked by Centralia two weeks ago and suffering a second-half letdown against rival Palmyra last week, Monroe City coach David Kirby told his team to reset the season ahead of the game Friday.
 “Coach told us to just focus on being 1-0 after tonight,” said Monroe City junior running back Joshua Talton, who posted 97 yards rushing and nailed a critical fourth-down tackle to help preserve the game. “We took two loses from two very good teams. We just wanted to get another W. Feels good.”
 Kirby went back to basic Monroe City football. Run. Run. Run.
 “That team played their butts off tonight,” Kirby said of the opponent. “We knew with their size it would take a great effort. We had a tough week of practice.”
 The Panthers (4-2) never trailed in the game. Monroe City scored two touchdowns in the first half to take a 12-6 lead into halftime.
 A stellar third quarter helped the Panthers take control of the game.
 Down 12-6, Brookfield took the second-half kickoff, and at first the Bulldogs were seemingly on an unstoppable path to tie the game.
 But after allowing the Bulldogs to march from their own 35-yard line to the Monroe City 27-yard line in a drive that went for more than half of the third quarter, the Panthers defense stiffened, holding Brookfield to a turnover on downs.
 Monroe City then pieced together a drive that frustrated the bigger Brookfield defenders, controlling the clock and the game as the Panthers marched 73 yards on 17 plays. The drive went over eight minutes, starting the middle of the third quarter and ending with 11:10 left in the game on a Talton 2-yard touchdown run. The Panthers kept the drive alive twice with fourth-down conversions.
 But with an 18-6 lead, Brookfield fought back, piecing together a short four- play drive after stopping Monroe City on a fourth down at the Panthers’ 38-yard line. With fourth-and-two from the 31-yard line, Brookfield quarterback Derek Liebhart faked a hand-off in the middle, optioned around end and raced 31 yards for a score.
 Monroe City grabbed the ensuing onside kick at its own 45-yard line, ran five plays and scored on a 40-yard run by quarterback Kyle Hays, who moved around right end and raced through the Brookfield defense. With the successful conversion, Monroe City took a 26-12 lead.
 The Monroe City defense played hard, holding the Bulldogs on a fourth down at their own 40, only to be called back when an overzealous defensive lineman, Connor Pfaff, knocked Liebhart to the ground, drawing a roughing the passer penalty and giving the Bulldogs another chance.
 Then Pfaff, who at halftime was named homecoming king, more than atoned for his mistake. On second down, after a near circus catch by Brookfield’s Carson Beckman, Pfaff shed a much larger lineman, and forcefully batted down a Liebhart pass.
 On fourth down, Pfaff raced past two blockers to sack Liebhart, sealing the Monroe City win.
 “I just got a fast start and move in for the sack. Earlier, my emotions just got the better of me,” Pfaff said. “We have to always be faster on the defensive line because most lines are always bigger.”

Increasing of industrial field expenditures, more-intense competition, launches in introducing new products, retrofitting and renovation of old technology, increasing adoption of hummus in emerging countries will drive growth in global market.The impact on the cost and availability of raw materials is uncertain due to potential supply changes. The costs of raw materials have a significant impact on the level of expenses.

Issue 2 would allow current legislators and those voted to office in November to serve 16 years (under the current standard) but would allow them to then run again after the four-year break.
 Issue 3, the initiative process and legislative referral requirements amendment, would change requirements for citizen-initiated and legislative- initiated ballot issues.
 It would eliminate the requirement to publish legislative amendments in a newspaper in each county for six months ahead of the election. Instead, those amendments would be published “in a manner provided by law.” It would also require a three-fifths vote of both chambers of the legislature to refer a proposed constitutional amendment to voters.
 It would make several changes to citizen-initiated ballot issues, including:
 Require that a petition must contain valid signatures equaling at least half of the required percentage of signatures from each of 45 counties instead of the current requirement of 15 counties.
 Eliminate the option for petitioners to collect extra signatures for 30 days if the petition fails to meet the signature requirement but the petition has at least 75 percent of the valid signatures needed.
 Require challenges to the sufficiency of any ballot measure to be filed no later than April 15 of the election year. There is currently no deadline.
 Require signatures for citizen initiative petitions to be submitted to the secretary of state by Jan. 15 of the election year rather than the current deadline of four months before the election.

 Minsk canceled accreditations for a slew of foreign news media outlets operating in the country following extensive coverage of the unrest that followed the August 9 disputed presidential election.

 "Applications are received daily, as I know, there are already more than 70 of them from about 15 foreign media outlets. In a word, the process is underway...

Courier-Post Staff Writer
 Once upon a time, when my wife, Nancy, and I were still making beautiful babies and living on the plains of south-central Kansas in a railroad town named Newton, I was the one who did the weekly grocery shopping for our family of six.
 Considering that our twin daughters were born in early January, during flu and cold season, it would not have made any sense to load them up on a frigid day and take them to the grocery store. Neither was it logical to hand the car keys over to my bride, knowing that our infant daughters would not want to see my face should they get hungry before their mother arrived home and could nurse them. Consequently, once Nancy’s mother, Glenda, returned home I was schooled in how to properly and efficiently grocery shop. Think “Grocery Shopping for Dummies” and you will pretty accurately visualize the curriculum I was taught from.
 Understandably it did not take much to cause my eyes to glaze over during my initial trips to the store. So many products claiming to do the same thing, it was easy to become overwhelmed. And considering this was an era before cellphones, there was no calling home for clarification if we wanted absorbent, or extra absorbent. Consequently, Nancy started sending me to the store with the most detailed shopping lists imaginable, which meant there was little room for confusion.
 Eventually once our daughters grew to a point where they did not want to eat every couple of hours, Nancy took back over the shopping duties for our family. Sometimes I think she considered a trip to the store, minus her husband and four young children, to be almost therapeutic.
 Much has changed since those days in Kansas, but one thing that hasn’t is that grocery shopping has remained Nancy’s domain, which has been just fine with me.
 While previously I would periodically accompany my bride on her multi-store grocery shopping excursions, since the arrival of the COVID-19 virus in Northeast Missouri, I have not even been asked to ride shotgun.
 The last trip to the store that I made was when I accompanied my oldest son, Caleb, to Walmart a few weeks back, but I am not sure that even qualifies, since we were not buying food supplies.
 When Nancy would return home from shopping I would frequently quiz her regarding what had been sold out and what was being rationed. Often I was amazed by the items that people were choosing to stockpile. I mean I get that no one wants to run out of toilet paper, but to wipe out a store’s entire supply, except for the see-through generic stuff … Amazing.
 I recently received an email that was predicting another run on toilet paper. The cause? The number of families whose students are remote learning.
 According to the poll, 60% of Americans with students who are remote learning expect to go through five more rolls of toilet paper per week, 26% said 6-10 extra rolls per week and 8% said 11-15.
 A new study from Bio Bidet reports that 99% of Americans are using more toilet paper than ever before, and 64% are concerned about spending more on toilet paper, with 24.3% expecting to spend $20 or more a week on toilet paper.
 With approximately 645 youngsters enrolled in the Hannibal School District’s Pirate Virtual Academy, I can’t help but wonder if we are headed for another run on toilet paper?

Fast forward to today, and the spikes on cleats are longer than ever. Couple that with the fact that turf fields have amazing drainage systems, and you start to see why traction has increased so drastically.
 The physics of the problem is simple: If a player’s cleats get stuck in the ground, and then his knee twists in a way a knee isn’t meant to twist, something’s got to give. More often than not, that something is the ACL.
 If your son is going to be playing a majority of his games on a turf field, one thing you might consider is purchasing a pair of turf-appropriate cleats. An easy way to tell if a cleat will be a good option for turf is if the sole of the shoe is “molded.”
 This just means there aren’t any screw-in spikes. The screw-in style of cleats have longer spikes and are much better suited for grass fields.
 You might even consider getting your son a pair of turf cleats along with a pair of grass cleats. I realize this is not something every parent can afford for their child. But if we’re talking about safety, it’s the way to go.

HANNIBAL — The Hannibal Lady Pirates fell just short of advancing in tennis district play against Smith-Cotton on Monday at Hannibal High School.
 Smith-Cotton won the match 5-4, with the two teams splitting singles play and Smith-Cotton taking two out of three doubles matches.
 Hannibal tennis head coach Abbey Jeffries said Smith-Cotton played well in its Class 2 District 4 first round win that eliminated the Pirates.
 “For them to come out like that was quite a shock,” Jeffries said. “I told my girls to prepare for anything. We never know how people are going to play, especially if you have a bad day, it can go a long way.”
 Smith-Cotton’s first three singles players defeated Hannibal’s top three single players, with Emma Haner falling to Tigers No. 1 Caroline Matz (6-0, 6-0), Irelan Lomax falling to Tigers No. 2 Anita Husgeva (6-3, 6-1) and Brooklyn Haye falling to Tigers No. 3 Elinor Beard (6-2, 6-1).
 Hannibal rallied back to win the final three singles matches. Gracie Martin defeated Tigers No. 4 Ellie Kotok (6-1, 6-1), Jaspreet Kandola defeated Tigers No. 5 Adelina Kukosh (6-4, 6-2) and Lanie Privett defeated Tigers No. 6 Grace Miley (6-1, 6-2).
 “Gracie did good, so did Lanie and Jaspreet hung in there and got the win,” Jeffries said. “I would say those girls played a role into putting us this far today.”
 The Hannibal doubles team of Haye and Martin defeated Smith-Cotton’s duo of Kotok and Kukosh (8-3). Smith-Cotton won the other two doubles matches, with Haner and Lomax falling to Smith-Cotton’s duo of Matz and Husgeva (8-1) and Kandola and Privett falling to Smith-Cotton’s duo of Beard and Miley (8-6).
 Windy conditions played a factor in Monday’s district match.
 “It was (a nice day), Jeffries said. “With the wind, you can either use the wind or it will go against you. Got to work with it that way.”
 Hannibal finishes with a 6-4-1 record for the season. It was the final match for Kandola, who finished with a singles win and a doubles loss in her finale.
 “It was a really great season and I enjoyed having all of the girls,” Jeffries said. “I’m super excited for next year because I think we are building a really strong foundation of girls. We only have two seniors that are leaving, so it’s not like we (will) have half of our team gone.”

Oh my, it is the time for Christians to get serious about prayer. The country had planned prayers at courthouses and prayer walks in Washington D.C. Now 50,000 people had met in Washington D.C. to pray! It was a powerful statement in the USA! At the Cleburne County Courthouse a smaller crowd had gathered on Saturday night. County officials and pastors from various denominations gathered to pray also. I’m thinking these little local groups all over the nation were praying that night. America needed help! And continues to need help! Hopefully the Christians are serious about humbling themselves, asking forgiveness for their sins, and praying with faith for God to guide our country out of this combination of trials and tribulations!
 After praying for our country the Old Woman remembered all the blessings and answered prayers of the past, and a peace came over her once again. She will continue to pray for our country, but today she will begin to look expectantly for the answers to Americans’ prayers, and by the way, they really do matter! There’s beginning to be a feeling of hope in her, and soon she feels that we will see answers all over the place! I’m getting really excited myself!
 Off goes the Old Woman humming quietly. Then..she breaks out in that child’s prayer again ... Thank you for our blessings, Thank you for our blessings. A-men,A-men ( I think that two year old’s song mattered! Don’t you?)

Sure, maybe you were able to get lucky and landed some top- tier depth at running back by grabbing Jerick McKinnon or James Robinson late in your fantasy draft. Maybe your receiving corps is stacked and you have enough top-tier talent or matchup-based plays to get a high-ceiling player in at the flex spot.
