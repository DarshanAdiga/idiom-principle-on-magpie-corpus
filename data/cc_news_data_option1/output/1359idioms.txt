The decisions leave Wisconsin as the only state with an election scheduled in April that is proceeding as planned. As other states prepare to vote in May or June, Wisconsin will be closely watched for signs that fears of the coronavirus may depress turnout or cause other problems at the polls.
 Evers said he had no other options after the state court ruled against him.
 "There's not a Plan B. There's not a Plan C," Evers said earlier Monday. After the court rulings, Evers said voters will now have to "wake up and have to choose between exercising their right to vote and staying healthy and safe. "
 Joe Biden already has a commanding delegate lead over Bernie Sanders and the Wisconsin results aren't likely to slow his march to the Democratic presidential nomination. But the tumult in one of the most critical general election battlegrounds was a reminder of how the coronavirus has upended politics during an election year. Beyond the shifts in the primary calendar, Biden and President Donald Trump have not been able to hold in-person campaign events and have moved most of their operations online.
 The tension in Wisconsin over whether and how to proceed with the election has been building for weeks. Evers and Republicans initially agreed it was imperative for the election to proceed because thousands of local offices are on the ballot Tuesday for terms that begin in two weeks. There is also a state Supreme Court election.

The headlines for the last couple of weeks have mostly been around the exponentially increasing number of Covid-19 cases and how governments and central banks world over are deploying unusual weapons to fight the economic fallouts of the pandemic. Central banks have resorted to a wide array of tools, aside from reductions in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and repo rates. The Bank of England mentioned one such unusual tool, announcing a cut in the counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCCB) to 0 per cent, from 1 per cent currently. On April 2, the financial regulatory authority of Germany also followed suit and cut the CCCB to 0 per cent from 0.25 per cent. The RBI, however, has decided that it is not necessary to activate the CCCB at this point in time.
 What is it?
 Following Basel-III norms, central banks specify certain capital adequacy norms for banks in a country. The CCCB is a part of such norms and is calculated as a fixed percentage of a bank’s risk-weighted loan book.
 However, one key respect in which the CCCB differs from other forms of capital adequacy is that it works to help a bank counteract the effect of a downturn or distressed economic conditions. With the CCCB, banks are required to set aside a higher portion of their capital during good times when loans are growing rapidly, so that the capital can be released and used during bad times, when there’s distress in the economy.
 The CCCB is supposed to be in the form of equity capital, and if the minimum buffer requirements are breached, capital distribution constraints such as limits on dividends and share buybacks can be imposed on the bank.
 Although the RBI had proposed the CCCB for Indian banks in 2015 as part of its Basel-III requirements, it hasn’t actually required the CCCB to be maintained, keeping the ratio at zero per cent ever since. This is based on the RBI’s review of the credit-GDP gap, the growth in GNPA, the industry outlook assessment index, interest coverage ratio and other indicators, as part of the first monetary policy of every financial year.
 Why is it important?
 Apart from acting as a buffer that can be drawn upon during distress, the CCCB also helps head off systemic risks by curbing unruly bank credit growth. Systemic risks refer to events that can, besides impacting individual banks, shake up the financial system. The financial crisis of 2008-09 is an example of how systemic risks can play out — individual defaults in subprime mortgages and a credit crunch for banks sparked the biggest financial crisis of all time in the US. After the financial crisis, the Basel committee, comprised of banking regulators, came up with the Basel-III norms, which set new regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity. The CCCB was introduced as a part of those norms.
 Why should I care?
 When an economy is booming, you usually have a variety of lenders, from NBFCs to banks to others, knocking at your door to offer loans. One might not even want to resort to approaching a bank, considering the speed of credit approval that other lenders may offer. However, the tables turn when the economy is facing a distress, and most sources dry up. This can be disastrous, considering that businesses and households need more financial support during such times. Hence comes the need for banks to increase their credit during times of distress. The CCCB ensures that central banks can direct bankers to release more credit by freeing up capital, when distress situations arise. In India, the RBI’s move to not to impose the CCCB on banks from 2015 has meant they don’t have any capital buffer to draw on. But not activating it now can help banks keep up the credit flow in the economy.
 The bottomline
 While banks may prefer to go with the flow, tools like the CCCB come in handy for the regulator to nudge them to swim against the tide.

Although the global supply chain is usually a well-oiled machine consisting of a system of organizations, people, processes, information and resources, disruption of this well-oiled machine has become the new reality. According to a new survey released by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), 75% of companies worldwide have reported supply chain disruptions as a result of COVID-19. Added to that is the increasingly unpredictable demand caused by panic buying and consumer stockpiling.

CUSHING, Texas (KTRE) - With social distancing guidelines in place, you might wonder how anyone can still have a birthday party. However, one East Texas girl was still able to have her party from a distance.Chloe Jones turned 14 years old Saturday. To celebrate, Jennifer Harrell, her aunt, planned a birthday parade of cars containing her closest friends and family. You could hear the car horns honking, cowbells ringing and see balloons flying freely almost a mile down the road leading to Chloe’s house.“I had no idea we were going to have this many people. She had teachers here, her basketball coach was here, my friends from work even came by,” Harrell said.Harrel said this idea of a parade came about because they thought it would be important to practice social distancing and still be able to celebrate her birthday.“We knew there wasn’t going to be any contact, so when I started planning that I just wanted to make sure I had all my bases covered,” Harrell said.As people drove by, the sign “Happy 14th Birthday Chloe” was on display for everyone to see. The sign was created by Karrissa Theret, the owner of Sign Gypsie Nacogdoches-Lufkin.“Not only is it affecting the person getting the sign, but other people drive by. Random people can drive by and see it and just have a smile on their face,” Theret said. “Seeing the sign is spreading joy to people and letting people still have some sort of normalcy during this time."Although people worldwide have been postponing their birthday celebrations due to COVID-19, Theret says they are working completely within the rules of social distancing.“It's just an easy way to continue the celebration without having to break the rules right now,” Theret added.“We’re just really excited that we could do something for her,” Harrell said.Bright-eyed and smiling broadly, Chloe expressed her gratitude.“It’s one of my best birthdays for sure. It’s a lot of fun being out here and being able to see everyone come out and just say happy birthday to me,” Jones said.Theret explained that a parade of cars is a good way to celebrate with family and friends because you’re able to see it unfold in such a different way, while keeping everybody safe.Copyright 2020 KTRE.

BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — A shark fatally mauled a young Australian wildlife worker on the Great Barrier Reef, officials said Tuesday. Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the 23-year-old victim worked for the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service. “Once again a family out there is grieving for a young man who tragically has lost his life in this horrific shark attack,” she told reporters. Police said the man was in the water, returning to a vessel chartered by the service when he was attacked Monday near North West Island, 75 kilometers (47 miles) northeast of Gladstone. He suffered extensive injuries to his leg and arm and died at a hospital hours later. Detective Senior Sergeant Tony Anderson said the ranger had been doing maintenance work before the attack. The victim was the last person out of the water. “At the end of the day there were four people swimming off the back of a boat, cooling down after a day’s work,” he told reporters. There have been at least three shark attacks on the Great Barrier Reef over the past 18 months. Last October, two British backpackers were attacked while snorkeling at Hook Island in the Whitsunday Islands. One of the men lost his foot. In March 2019, a 25-year-old man suffered serious thigh injuries when a shark attacked him at Hardy Reef, near Hamilton Island, also in the Whitsundays chain. And in November 2018, Victorian doctor Daniel Christidis, 33, was killed at Cid Harbour at Whitsunday Island.
