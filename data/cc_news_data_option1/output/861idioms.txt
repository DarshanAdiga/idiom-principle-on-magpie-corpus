Nothing can stop Tove Lo from performing live, not even a fractured ankle. Fresh off a headlining trek, during which she sustained the injury, the pop singer has announced new tour dates for this summer.
 A few months ago, Tove Lo dropped her album _Sunshine Kitty_ and, to the delight of her fans, kept that momentum going by plotting a winter tour to celebrate it. After the success of those shows, she’s got energy to boot — hence why after kicking off her upcoming UK and European dates, she will return to North America for the start of a worldwide summer tour.

SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - A nice start to the week after a chilly weekend! Temperatures today have managed to reach the middle and upper 50s for everyone here in western Mass.
 This evening, a passing disturbance is bringing in more clouds and a threat for showers. Rain should stay light and we won’t see many, but some should be around early tonight. After midnight, showers should exit and areas of fog are possible. Temperatures stay above freezing with most in the 30s to near 40.
 Ahead of an approaching cold front, Tuesday will be a mild day with temperatures rising into the middle and upper 50s again. A few 60s are possible if the sun can come out for a time in the morning and early afternoon. As our cold front nears, showers become likely after 4pm and will continue off and on into the overnight hours.
 Drier air will rush in behind a departing cold front for Wednesday. It will be a blustery day with wind gusts reaching 30-40mph at times. Expect a mix of sun and clouds along with cooler temperatures as highs only make it into the 40s to near 50.

The loss of Nayreb and Saraqib point to a weakness in the SAA, a serious gap between their special forces and regular army. The 25th is already stretched, cannot be fighting and consolidating recaptured territory, and their backups are unable to hold the line against the taqfiris. This is preoccupying vis a vis an expanded conflict with Turkey’s regular army, plus the taqfiri scum. Now Hezbollah is again generously shedding their blood getting the Syrian nuts out of the fire, pushing the taqfiris out of Saraqib and the M5/M4 junction. I am sure they are the ones leading the lesser Syrian troops, along with the Fatimiyoun, in close coordination with the Iranians.

To put it mildly, people don't seem to like the League of Legends client. So it's welcome news that Riot Games has announced a 'Client Cleanup Campaign', which is just a slightly over-formal way of saying that they're going to fix it.
 The campaign appears to be pretty thorough, with Riot's announcement admitting that the client "is not in great shape". It cites bugs, lag, memory leaks, crashes and freezes as some of the biggest concerns, and yes, they _are_ all very big and annoying problems.
 It's a pretty long post, with a lot of data provided. But the most important points are as follows: the "specific long-term targets" are to lower boostrap time (how long it takes to boot the client) to about 15 seconds, which Riot claims is about "three and four times faster" than it is at the moment. Meanwhile, champion select lock-in response times should become about eight times faster.
 But neither of these things are bugs per se, but there's method in Riot's madness. "Why prioritize these two things first? The reason is that, in the process of addressing bootstrap time and champ select lock-in time, we're going to be cleaning up and reworking certain fundamental aspects of the client's architecture. We believe that we'll be able to opportunistically address bugs, memory leaks, and crashes while pursuing these targets".
 If you'd like to read the very thorough post for yourself, here it is. It's unlikely you missed it, but in case you did, Riot unveiled its brand new first-person shooter today.
