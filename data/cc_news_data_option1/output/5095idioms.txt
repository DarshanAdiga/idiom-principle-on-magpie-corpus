American Airlines (AAL Stock Report) is another epicenter stock that is on many investors’ radar. Since climbing more than 50% in November alone, the airline flew to a higher altitude this week in apparent response to a change of stake from investment manager BlackRock (BLK Stock Report). But here’s a catch. If we dig deeper at the history of the company’s stake this year, we know that the investment firm is not taking a new position. Rather, it has been shedding its holdings from 5.5% in April to 4.8% now. Investors who jumped straight to the headline and proceed with their purchase might want to think twice now. Of course, these investment management companies could be wrong too.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Faced with the prospect of sanctions from both the United States and the European Union, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that economic penalties would be detrimental to all sides and that Turkey's disputes with its allies can be resolved through dialogue and cooperation.
 Erdogan’s comments came hours after the EU gave the green light for the expansion of sanctions against Turkey over its exploration of gas reserves in eastern Mediterranean waters claimed by EU members Greece and Cyprus.
 Turkey also faces US sanctions over its purchase of a Russian air defense system, which has already resulted in the NATO-member being kicked out of the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter program.
 “We have deep-rooted political and economic relations with both the United States and the European Union, which neither side can ignore or certainly risk losing,” Erdogan said in a teleconference address to his ruling party’s officials. “There is no issue that cannot be solved through dialogue and cooperation.”
 The EU leaders said early Friday that Turkey — which is a candidate to join although its membership talks are blocked — has “engaged in unilateral actions and provocations and escalated its rhetoric against the EU.” This was despite the fact that they had offered trade and other incentives to Turkey to halt its activities during their last summit in October, they said.
 The leaders tasked EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell with drawing up a report on the state of EU-Turkey political, economic and trade relations and with suggesting how to proceed, including on widening sanctions. Borrrell was asked to submit the report to the leaders by the time they hold a summit in March.

 DeLuca had one goal which was to get back on the field. After months away from his teammates and the football field he made his triumphant return. He put together a fantastic season and after the Duke game on Halloween night he was tied for being Charlotte all time leading tackler with 306.
 Then another hurdle was thrown in the way with Covid-19. Six weeks would come and go with no football. Multiple cancellations and postponements made things hard for the team but through it all DeLuca stood tall. He would lead the team through the tumultuous times to the game on Sunday, Dec. 6 against C-USA opponent Western Kentucky.
 The Niners struggled in their first game back and lost 37-19 against the Hilltoppers. DeLuca though was the one bright spot for the Niners and the time came for the record to be broken. DeLuca would finish the game with seven total tackles which would be enough.

GRAHAM, N.C. (AP) — Three newspapers have asked the North Carolina Court of Appeals to order courts in a county where rally-goers were pepper sprayed and arrested to stop barring reporters from court proceedings. Court staff in Alamance County have said limiting entry to defendants, victims and their attorneys was due to COVID-19, but attorneys for The News & Observer, Triad City Beat and Alamance News said in their filing Thursday that “dispensing justice behind closed doors” was unconstitutional and “undermines public trust in the judicial process,” The New & Observer reported. The filing came after District Court Judge Fred Wilkins barred reporters from attending a Tuesday plea hearing for Sandra Warren Brazee, a white woman accused of driving her pickup truck at two 12-year-old Black girls. Tom Boney Jr., publisher of The Alamance News, was handcuffed and ordered out of a courtroom as he objected to a decision. He was then released. “Even accepting that the COVID-19 pandemic creates a compelling need to safeguard public health by imposing some limits on access to courtrooms, the draconian restrictions imposed by Judge Wilkins were not necessary to serve that interest,” Attorney C. Amanda Martin wrote in the emergency appeal. The week before, Wilkins had barred reporters from attending a court hearing for the Rev. Greg Drumwright, the organizer of the Oct. 31 get-out-the-vote rally in Graham that ended with police pepper-spraying and arresting participants. The attorneys asked for a quick decision because cases stemming from racial injustice protests are set to be heard in the upcoming weeks.

He is now in the hands of Nigel Twiston-Davies and ran in the Champion Bumper in March, scoring his first win over obstacles in October.

The prisoner died at an area health care facility, and it is the first COVID-19-related death for an inmate at Stafford Creek, KIRO-TV reported. Department of Corrections officials said due to the rising number of cases, the facility has restricted movement to limit any risk to exposure of the virus. The facility continues to practice COVID-19 screening, testing and infection control to prevent the spread of the virus, officials said. It is the fourth death of an inmate related to COVID-19 in the state. A state corrections officer has also died of COVID-19. The death comes a day after the families of those behind bars protested outside the state capitol, asking for more inmates to be released in order to reduce the chances they would contract the virus.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed the criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn but pointedly noted that a pardon Flynn received from the president last month does not mean that he is innocent.The order from U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan was expected in light of the pardon from President Donald Trump that wiped away Flynn’s conviction for lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation. Sullivan acknowledged in his 43-page order that the president’s broad pardon powers required dismissal and that the decision to pardon him is a political, rather than legal, one.But he also stressed that a pardon, by itself, did not mean that Flynn was innocent of a crime he had twice pleaded guilty to committing. He dismissed as “dubious to say the least” the Justice Department’s stated rationales for seeking to drop the case — a request that was still pending at the time the pardon was issued — and noted the president’s own personal interest in this case.“The history of the Constitution, its structure, and the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the pardon power make clear that President Trump’s decision to pardon Mr. Flynn is a political decision, not a legal one,” he wrote. “Because the law recognizes the President’s political power to pardon, the appropriate course is to dismiss this case as moot.”However, he added, “a pardon does not necessarily render ‘innocent’ a defendant of any alleged violation of the law. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that the acceptance of a pardon implies a ‘confession’ of guilt.”Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “Dismissal is, of course, the correct result.” Trump himself congratulated Flynn on the judge’s decision, writing in a tweet, “He and his incredible family have suffered greatly!”The order brings to an end the yearslong saga involving Flynn, who was ousted from his White House job just weeks into his tenure.He twice admitted guilt during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation to lying to the FBI about conversations he had during the presidential transition period with the-then Russian ambassador to the United States. Those talks involved sanctions that the Obama administration had just imposed on Russia for election interference.But the Justice Department last spring abruptly moved to dismiss the case, despite Flynn’s own guilty plea, arguing that there was insufficient basis for the FBI to have questioned him in the first place and that the statements he made during the interview were immaterial to the underlying investigation into whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russia.Sullivan had resisted the department’s request to dismiss the case and appointed a former federal judge from New York to argue against its motion. He defended his stance on Tuesday even as he dismissed the prosecution, writing that “many of the government’s reasons for why it has decided to reverse course and seek dismissal in this case appear pretextual, particularly in view of the surrounding circumstances.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Meanwhile Energumene (Denham Red x April Night), bred by Christophe Dubourg, made his mark over Irish fences at Gowran on 20 November under Paul Townend.

NEW YORK - The author of a highly anticipated debut story collection has died. Anthony Veasna So was 28. His death was announced Thursday by his publisher, Ecco, which did not immediately provide additional details.
 A native of Stockton, California, who had settled in San Francisco, So once described himself as a “queer boy, a Khmer-American son of former refugees, a failed computer scientist, a grotesque parody of the model minority, and a graduate of Stanford University.” In “Afterparties," to be published in August, he drew upon the tragedies his family endured in Cambodia during the rule of the Khmer Rouge and his own struggles with sexual and cultural identity.
 “'Afterparties' was one of the first books I acquired for Ecco, and everything about Anthony’s exuberant writing felt new to me — its blazing wit, crackling energy, deep empathy,” So's editor, Helen Atsma, tweeted Thursday.
 Publishers Weekly reported earlier this year that So had agreed to a two-book, six-figure deal with Ecco, which prevailed over several other interested publishers. George Saunders, Bryan Washington and Mary Karr are among those who have praised him.
 “The mind-frying hilarity of Anthony Veasna So’s first book of fiction settles him as the genius of social satire our age needs now more than ever," Karr wrote in a blurb for the book. “Few writers can handle firm plot action and wrenching pathos in such elegant prose. This unforgettable new voice is at once poetic and laugh-out-loud funny.”

Andy Halliday - as hardworking as he was - was a jack of all trades while Jon Flanagan was a right footed left back and it left Rangers unbalanced and easier to stop.
 Now? Calvin Bassey can step in and while he might not have the same delivery, his close control, passing and powerful running makes him a more than able deputy for Rangers.
 Gerrard discussed the fluidity ahead of Sunday's game against Dundee United and said: "Everyone knows what we’re about, what we try to do in terms of the fluency, what the expectations are and the standards we’ve tried to set.
 "New players have had enough time to settle in, the idea was always to build a squad where you have got two players fighting for each position so it’s very competitive in terms of the fight for the shirt. The training intensity is really where we want it.
 "We’re in a good place but the challenge for us is to work even harder, fight even more to remain in good form."
 In all competitions this season, Rangers have used a total of 27 players already. That includes youngsters Ciaran Dickson, Leon King and Glenn Middleton but it's still impressive.
 In comparison to last season, they used just 32 across the whole campaign with eight players playing more than 40 games before the season was called in March.
 It's obvious that Rangers now have the right options to make sure it's not just a 'first eleven anymore.

Leith paid back government furlough cash it had claimed two months ago, after the agency's year was boosted by creating the Scottish government’s public- health messaging around Covid-19.
 The agency, which is named after the district of Edinburgh in which it is based, holds the account for the devolved government’s public-health programme, Healthier Scotland, and delivered 17 mini-campaigns about the pandemic.
 After the UK government announced the Job Retention Scheme, Leith placed eight of its 86 staff on furlough, with the agency topping up the 80% of their usual salaries paid under the initiative by the UK government to 100%.
 The employees rejoined the business at different stages, with the last back at work by August. After a successful year, the agency’s management decided to return the furlough money and it was paid back in October.
 Richard Marsham, group managing partner at Leith, said: “The eight members of staff that we put on furlough in March returned to work by August. We took the decision to pay back the money in October. On the back of being very busy with Scottish government work, it felt like the right thing to do.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A jury on Wednesday convicted the leader of an Illinois anti-government militia group of several civil rights and hate crime charges in the 2017 bombing of a Minnesota mosque.Prosecutors outlined 49-year-old Michael Hari’s hatred for Muslims as his motivation for the bombing during the trial, citing anti-Islam excerpts from Hari’s manifesto known as The White Rabbit Handbook, named after his militia group. Prosecutors presented evidence to jurors that included phone records and testimony of federal investigators who tracked Hari down to Clarence, Illinois, a rural community about 120 miles (190 kilometers) south of Chicago where Hari and two co-defendants lived after a seven-month investigation.The bombing took place on Aug. 5, 2017, when the pipe bomb exploded in the imam’s office as worshippers gathered for early morning prayers. No one was hurt in the explosion, though community members where shaken by the incident and the mosque’s executive director testified last month that it has led to diminished attendance due to fear.Local faith leaders gathered in front of the federal courthouse building in St. Paul and thanked prosecutors and the jury during a press conference after the verdict was delivered. Abdulahi Farah, a program director at Dar Al-Farooq, said the mosque’s sense of community was “shattered” after the attack, but the guilty verdict sends a “strong message” to their congregants and other Muslim communities across the state.“Our community members definitely have been sharing messages of hope instead of fear and isolation,” Farah said. “Many more members are slowly coming back and feeling like this is the place where we belong, this is our home and we’re not going anywhere.”Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said during the press conference that while justice has been served in this individual case, the threat of violence toward Muslim communities by white supremacist groups still exists. Hussein said these groups have been galvanized by the Trump administration and that he is concerned the groups will take out their frustration with the president’s loss in November’s election on Muslim communities across the nation.“We urge, as we celebrate today’s verdict, that law enforcement and particularly state and federal leadership do not ignore ... the potential for more severe crimes like this happening moving forward,” he said.U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald said in a release Wednesday that Hari’s goal was to undermine the Dar Al-Farooq congregation’s right to practice their religion with violence “driven by hatred and ignorance.”“Today’s guilty verdicts represent a condemnation of that hatred and uphold our fundamental right to live and worship free from the threat of violence and discrimination,” she said.Hari was found guilty on all five counts, which include using explosives, damaging property because of its religious character and obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs. A sentencing hearing for Hari, who faces a mandatory minimum of 35 years in prison, has yet to be scheduled, according to MacDonald.The Star Tribune reported that Hari called the newspaper from jail a few hours after his conviction to say he was beginning a hunger strike.“I am protesting my sham trial by submitting to a trial by ordeal in the form of a hunger strike to prove my innocence and my sincerity,” Hari said, according to the newspaper. Hari also said he was embarking on the strike for people wrongly convicted of drug-related crimes, the newspaper reported.The testimony by Hari’s co-defendants, Joe Morris and Michael McWhorter, described how Morris viewed Hari as a father figure, and how Hari instructed them to throw the pipe bomb into the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center as Hari waited in the car after driving up from Illinois in a truck rented by Hari. Morris, who along with McWhorter pleaded guilty in January 2019 to their role in the attack, testified that Hari said the mosque trained ISIS fighters.Defense attorneys argued that prosecutors failed to produce forensic evidence putting Hari at the suburban Minneapolis mosque on the day of the attack and attempted to discredit Morris and McWhorter with what they said were inconsistencies in their testimony. Hari refused to testify in his own defense.Prosecutors refuted the defense’s claims, citing Hari’s past as a former sheriff’s deputy that investigated crimes as how he knew not to leave forensic evidence behind.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The advancements in consumer electronics has emerged as a major positive recently. The technology has enabled developments like Personal Area Network, advanced personal control to mobile users, and concepts like smart home automation. Among these, the smart home automation promises opportunities in many areas including lighting, security, lawn / gardening management, smart home appliances, advanced home entertainment systems, AI personal assistants, and HVAC systems. The home automation is expected to receive a major boost in the near future, as major carries like Verizon have rolled out 5G technology already in key markets like the US. Moreover, the technology has already been widely adopted in China, wherein the government has driven key infrastructure developments like IoV on the back of advanced networking capabilities. One of the biggest pain point or opportunity in the market is expected to remain the efficiency, and advanced IoT capabilities of these devices. The rise in home automation can provide new impetus to ailing sectors like constructions with a boost to home prices, and is increasingly becoming a necessity due to green legislations for energy efficiency, and sustainable energy. For example, countries like India, and UK have laid out plans to replace conventional meters with smart meters in every home. The growth of 5G also seems promising as key companies like Apple in the US region has acquired the Intel’s 5G telecom division, which might soon power the adoption of technology worldwide.

Marvel boss Kevin Feige has confirmed that the role of T'Challa/Black Panther won't be recast following the death of Chadwick Boseman.      The actor passed away in August at the age of 43 following a secret battle with colon cancer, leaving many wondering what would happen to his character, the King of Wakanda, in the Black Panther sequel, which has been in development since the success of his first standalone movie in 2018.      During Disney's Investor Day on Thursday, Feige paid tribute to Boseman and announced that out of respect to the late actor, they will not be recasting the role and the sequel will instead focus on different characters.      "I wanted to acknowledge the devastating loss of a dear friend and member of the Marvel Studios family," he said, reports Deadline. "Chadwick Boseman was an immensely talented actor and an inspirational individual who affected all of our lives professionally and personally. His portrayal of T'Challa the Black Panther is iconic and transcends iteration of the character in any other medium from Marvel's past.      "To honour the legacy that Chad helped us build through his portrayal of the king of Wakanda, we want to continue to explore the world of Wakanda and all of the rich and varied characters introduced in the first film."      Feige's announcement comes shortly after Black Panther executive producer Victoria Alonso denied rumours that they would use a digital double to fill in for Boseman.      The Marvel boss added that Ryan Coogler, who made the original, is "hard at work" on the follow-up, which he is writing and directing. It is set to be released in July 2022.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in offered more detailed goals in November when he ordered government officials to develop a road map for transitioning to cleaner energy and carbon neutrality by 2050. He said his country would invest $7 billion in green projects, launch a carbon tax to encourage companies to reduce their emissions, and stop financing overseas coal plants. But those ideas, too, fall short of carbon neutrality in an economy that relies on energy-intensive industries.
