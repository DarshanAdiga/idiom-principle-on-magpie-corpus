Paris, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 19th Jan, 2020 ) :French police fired tear gas under a rain of projectiles and arrested several people Saturday as thousands of "yellow vest" anti-government protesters returned to the streets of Paris.


  Demonstrators shouted slogans denouncing the police, President Emmanuel Macron and his pension reforms that have triggered the longest French transport strike in decades.


  This was the latest of the weekly demonstrations held every Saturday by the yellow vest movement since November 2018, and which have been boosted by opposition to the pension reforms.


  Police said 15 people were arrested after police tried to disperse a bloc at the head of the protest in northern Paris.


  "The street is ours," some protesters chanted. "Macron, we're going to come for you, in your home." Police fired tear gas as they came under a hail of projectiles, AFP reporters witnessed.


  Annie Moukam, a 58-year-old teacher, said too many people in France were suffering.


  "We're suffocating with this government who wants to put us on our knees," Moukam said.


  "It's out of the question that he (Macron) touches our pensions.

In 1819, voters in the district of Maine approved a referendum for statehood in such overwhelming numbers that the state of Massachusetts could no longer ignore their demands for independence. Soon after that referendum, residents of the Maine district met in Portland in October to craft a state constitution. At the same time, the Massachusetts Legislature reluctantly passed a statehood bill and sent it on to the United States Congress, with the caveat that if Congress and the president did not approve the bill by March 4, 1820, the territory that was Maine would remain part of Massachusetts. Things came down to the wire, but Congress passed the bill in early March 1820. On March 3, it was signed into law by President James Monroe.

Pfizer has announced the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval of Ibrance (palbociclib), following a final guidance from the organisation.


  The potentially life-extending drug will now be available for patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, advanced breast cancer, who have already had endocrine therapy.


  The med, which will be available on the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) in combination with fulvestrant, joins two other NICE-approved drugs - (Kisqali) ribociclib and Verzenios (abemaciclib) - as an option at this stage of the treatment pathway.


  The recommendation is based on data from the Phase III clinical trial, PALOMA-3, in which Ibrance delayed disease progression by 6.6 months, compared to fulvestrant alone.


  The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor works by inhibiting proteins in cancer cells, thereby preventing the cells from dividing and growing.


  Pfizer says that because of the approval, the treatment could be an option for up to 3,300 women who have already had endocrine treatment and where exemestane plus everolimus would be the most appropriate alternative to a CDK 4/6 inhibitor.


  Meindert Boysen, director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation said that the organisation is "pleased that the company has agreed a managed access agreement that will allow palbociclib to be made available within the Cancer Drugs Fund as a further treatment option for people with this type of breast cancer."


  In the advanced stages of the disease it is incurable, and in the UK only 15% of women will live beyond five years, meaning there is a real need for innovative treatment options that can delay disease progression and help women feel well for longer.

Best known for his 1990s role as the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, Starr became a household name with his report on Clinton's extramarital relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. That led to Clinton's impeachment over 20 years ago. A former U.S. solicitor general and federal circuit court judge, Starr has been a regular guest on Fox News, defending Trump on his favored network. But he and Trump haven't always been on the same page. “I think that Ken Starr is a lunatic. I really think that Ken Starr is a disaster,” Trump said in an interview with NBC's “Today” in 1999.

  Manchester City's frenetic afternoon rather summed up their season so far, as they misfired against a Palace side who beat them in the corresponding fixture last season.


  Sergio Aguero struck twice to overturn a deficit after debutant Cenk Tosun gave Palace a 39th-minute lead. It took Aguero above Frank Lampard into fourth spot on the all-time Premier League scoring list with 179 goals.


  But City's relief turned to frustration as Wilfried Zaha powered past John Stones and his cross deflected in off Fernandinho and beat City goalkeeper Ederson.


  "It was a tight game and unfortunately we could not win it," Guardiola said.


  Premier League history, of sorts, was made at Carrow Road where Paul Tierney became the first Premier League referee to send off a player after consulting a pitch-side monitor, adjudging Norwich's Ben Godfrey's late challenge on Callum Wilson worthy of the harshest punishment.


  It ratcheted up the tension for the home fans as Norwich should have been more than one goal ahead by the time Godfrey went off to make it 10 versus 10 in the 76th minute.


  But Norwich hung on to condemn Eddie Howe's Bournemouth to a fourth consecutive defeat and leave them second from bottom, three points behind 17th-placed Watford.


  "It is an important win for us. Three points, clean sheet, good for mood and confidence and the table. A good evening for us," Norwich boss Daniel Farke said. "There were some spicy moments in the last 10 minutes and anything can happen."


  Bournemouth have picked up four points from the last 36 on offer in the Premier League.

Today's agricultural industry is dramatically different than it was 75 years ago when Ashland Soil and Water Conservation District was founded, and farmers are facing a whole new set of challenges when it comes to protecting the state's water quality. That's why the soil and water district is offering new, high-tech computer modeling tools to help Ashland County farmers face those challenges and make the right choices when it comes to nutrient management.  


  Thanks to the support of Sunrise Cooperative, Land O'Lakes/Winfield United, Yara International and a water quality initiative grant from the Ohio Farm Bureau, Ashland SWCD is able to offer 100 percent cost share for up to 500 acres of cropland in the Jerome Fork watershed to utilize two such computer models for the 2020 growing season: Winfield's R7 Field Forescasting Tool and Yara International's Adapt-N nitrogen model.  


  "Through crop modeling applications, producers can determine their return on investment, identify correct nutrient application timing and rates and assess the risk of losing those nutrients," said Ashland SWCD District Technician Erica White in a news release. "All of that saves the producers money on fertilizer costs, which ties into improving water quality. The end result is less nutrient runoff when you take a deeper look at timing and rates of applications."  


  The Adapt-N model utilizes over 30 years of research from Cornell University on how nitrogen moves spatially through different soil types over time. It factors in how the source of the nitrogen, whether that be from a cover crop, manure application or commercial fertilizer and after taking into account management practices and weather data, it can identify how much nitrogen is actually available to the growing crop, giving producers the information they need to make the best nutrient management decisions possible.  


  "Adapt-N helps farmers assess how much nitrogen they have available so that they can be more efficient with their in-season nitrogen applications, but also more profitable by increasing the efficiency of their nitrogen dollars," said Jane Houin, Ashland SWCD district program administrator.  


  Similarly, Winfield United's R7 Field Forecasting Tool allows producers to input detailed management data and run different scenarios to determine the best timing, rate and return on investment for nutrient application. This tool uses soil tests, weather, potential yield, growing degree days, tissue tests, etc. to determine how different management decisions and timing are predicted to impact both yield and return on investment.  


  "Field Forecasting Tool is a predictive model that allows producers to see their investment of nutrient applications and when to apply those applications," said White. "When using theses crop modeling tools, producers are able to see how the four Rs, right rate, right time, right source and right place, can benefit the bottom dollar for farmers, all while managing nutrients to reduce the risk of nutrient runoff."  


  Applications for the crop modeling program are available at www.ashlandswcd.com and will be accepted through March 1. There is a 100 acre maximum on approved acres per producers.  


  In addition to Adapt-N and Field Forecasting Tool, Ashland SWCD has also partnered with Ohio State University to bring Ashland County producers access to On-Field Ohio! i -- a tool to estimate erosion and phosphorus runoff risk on each individual field. This program allows producers to see the effect management practices can have on their phosphorus runoff risk by comparing how changes in management practices such as tillage equipment, fertilizer placement, and cover crops impact erosion and phosphorus loss. On-Field Ohio is available to all Ashland County producers at no cost.  


  For questions regarding crop modeling or Ashland Soil and Water Conservation District, call the Ashland SWCD office at 419-281-7645.

While a return to Liverpool is unlikely, there is still plenty of mileage left in him yet, with Danny Cook asking for several big leaps and apart from one occasion Vintage Clouds responded.


  Having won the race on Our Vic for David Pipe as well as twice for Sue Smith already with Cloudy Too and Wakanda, Cook once again showed off his skills in a staying chase.


  With Sue and Harvey Smith on holiday in Spain, it was left to owner Trevor Hemmings' racing manager Mick Meagher to sing his praises.


  "It's great to win a big one with him, he deserved it," said Meagher.


  "He just didn't like Aintree, I don't think he'll be going back there, but he jumped great today because he can kick the odd one out of the ground.


  "That was the plan - today. We always thought he was a National horse, but he just doesn't like it so we might go back to Cheltenham for the race he was second in last year (Ultima) and then maybe the Scottish National. He could even come back here for the National Trial."


  Cook said: "He didn't take to the fences at Aintree, but they've done a good job on him at home and he got his confidence back when third in the Tommy Whittle here.


  "His home work has been A1 and when I schooled him on Wednesday I was just a passenger, he was fantastic.


  "He jumping was good apart from at one but that was my fault, I let the bit go in his mouth. You need to keep the bit high in his mouth when you ask him as it just gives him confidence.


  "He can drop the bridle going down the back so I just wanted to keep in contention, but when I was still in front turning in I didn't think anything would get by me.


  "I've ridden some good horses in this race, I've been lucky."


  Sam Brown followed up a recent win at Lingfield in style when coming home well clear in the Patrick Coyne Memorial Altcar Novices' Chase.


  At Lingfield he was returning from a 750-day absence, but there was no sign of the dreaded 'bounce' factor and Sam Brown and Aidan Coleman came home alone in a race which was littered with jumping errors and saw Windsor Avenue fall when beaten.


  Trained by Anthony Honeyball, the 9-4 winner won by 15 lengths from Dan Skelton's Knight In Dubai, who was unbeaten in two heading into the Grade Two contest.


  "He actually jumped well in the main apart from landing on top of one or two," said Honeyball.


  "I think that will do him good making those mistakes now and although there were only four runners, they looked to go a good gallop in that ground.


  "I'm delighted because turning in it looked like a car crash. He looked tired, he'd made mistakes and I was thinking I shouldn't have run him. He's got loads of stamina and he kept finding. I think heading to the top level he'll need three miles.


  "I wasn't too worried about the bounce factor because after Lingfield he came home and ate everything up so it hadn't taken much out of him. He was almost ready to run last season when he got injured again.

The first challenge to Indira Gandhi’s leadership post her consolidation over the party in 1969 emerged in Shimla when elections were held for the Congress Parliamentary Board (CPB). Chandrashekhar contested against the panel put up by her and won. CPB finds mention in almost every second paragraph of the Congress party’s Constitution. No elections either for CPB or CWC have been held ever since Sonia Gandhi took over the reins in 1998. Rahul Gandhi too did not think about CPB and continued with nominated CWC. This while neither mother nor son faced any prominent dissident leader within the party. Indira Gandhi had tackled dissidence and split the party in 1969 and in 1978 to consolidate her position. Rajiv Gandhi initially got pinpricks from Pranab Mukherjee and from Kamlapati Tripathi. He was vanquished by the machinations of his estranged cousin, Arun Nehru, who goaded Vishwanath Pratap Singh to lead a revolt, which ultimately resulted in the Bofors disaster and the defeat in 1989. P.V. Narasimha Rao had to face M.L. Fotedar, N.D. Tiwari and the Arjun Singh-led revolt (which had Sonia Gandhi’s covert support): Congress (Tiwari) and a breakaway party of Madhavrao Scindia put paid to Congress fortunes in 1996, despite Narasimha Rao having led a full five-year minority regime, which ushered in reform and a new paradigm in India. Sonia Gandhi’s opponent of 1999, Sharad Pawar is her trusted ally now—of his two comrades, Tariq Anwar has joined Congress; Purno Agitok Sangma’s family is now running the NDA-allied regime in Meghalaya.

Prices of some staple vegetables have begun to fall at the Koyambedu wholesale market on account of higher arrivals and lower demand during the holiday season.


  On Saturday, a measure of normalcy began to return to the market. During the Pongal holidays, the wholesale market received only 50-60% of the daily average in terms of arrivals, said traders.


  Onions, that touched a record high, are now priced between ₹45 and ₹60 a kg at the market. Small onions cost up to ₹110 a kg, depending on quality. The market has received 50 truckloads of onions daily, due to good yield, from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the traders said.


  Though most vegetables have become affordable, sales have been dull, and only 50% of the produce got sold. Overall, there was a 20% drop in sales compared to Pongal last year, said S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Wholesale Market Licensed Merchants’ Association.


  Ladies’ finger, chayote ( _chow chow_ in Tamil) and green chillies were some of the cheap vegetables, priced below ₹10 a kg, at the wholesale market. “We expect sales to pick up from Monday, after the holiday season,” he said.


  According to some traders, several vegetables are now priced upto ₹40 a kg. Beans and broad beans, that are usually costly, are priced at ₹35-40 a kg. Drumsticks remain the costliest, selling for ₹130-170 a kg, depending on quality.


  P. Sukumar, treasurer of the association, said prices had decreased by 20% in the past few days. “Vegetables such as cucumber, cabbage and radish, that have high water content, have less demand during winter, and are priced below ₹15 a kg,” he said.


  The cost of vegetables such as carrots, drumsticks and onions will dip further in a fortnight, after fresh arrivals hit the market. Prices will remain stable till the summer, Mr. Sukumar added.

Forty years back, Congress was the sole national party. CPI had a nationwide footprint but it was not reflected in its presence in the Parliament of India. The 1964 split in the Communist movement dissipated CPI and as years passed it became the junior partner of the CPI(M) in Left politics. Congress seems to be somewhat following the CPI trajectory. Its nationwide footprint notwithstanding, it is emerging as a bit player in state after state. NCP, which broke away from Congress in 1999, is now the elder brother in Maharashtra. Mamata’s Trinamool Congress, which broke away in 1998, now frowns at the presence of the West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) and in the anti-CAA movement has been critical of the national party’s joint action along with the Left parties in the state.

Despite the usual anti-Modi TV channels and the secularist print media embracing the protests as their own, it would be hard to believe that without generous cash hand-outs the hard-pressed housewives would have the time, energy and even motivation to brave the cold Delhi weather to perform the tamasha day after weary day.

DMK has been an ally of Congress off and on. In the run-up to the next elections in Tamil Nadu, where the ruling AIADMK is not looking comfortable, Congress-DMK alliance has been hit by the acrimony between the state PCC chief, K.S. Alagiri (an acolyte of P. Chidambaram) and the DMK supremo, M. K. Stalin. DMK stayed away from New Delhi on 13 January as a result. Sources say that Stalin suspects that the Chidambaram-Alagiri faction is inclined to play ball with film star Rajinikanth in the next elections. DMK and CPI had sustained the government of India Gandhi when she lost majority following the 1969 Congress split—the Morarji Desai-Kamraj led Congress (O) took away 64 of the 283 Congress Lok Sabha members: 23 of CPI and 25 DMK helped Indira Gandhi cross the halfway mark, which then stood at 260 (Lok Sabha had 520 members then).

  But the fans dodged the security personnel and broke the rear gate allowing all and sundry to flock in filling every s[pace including the playing court against the Fiba rules. The rules require that fans do not access the perimeter wall of the playing court.


  Both the Kenya Morans and the South Sudan teams left the venue for their respective hotels briefly before returning for the showdown.

They were also sick and tired of being under the rule of a government far to their south. For 35 years — since the end of the Revolutionary War — Mainers had been petitioning for statehood. People who lived and worked in what was then a 30,000-square-mile district governed by Massachusetts wanted to break away as their own, separate entity. In the years leading up to 1820, residents of what would become Maine had amassed a lot of grievances against the politicians down in Boston. They were tired of laws that devalued the Maine district’s timber, tired of paying taxes on land or livestock based on values assessed in by politicians who lived hundreds of miles to the south and had never set foot on the land in the Maine district. Things really came to a head during the War of 1812 when the state did little to help or protect the people in the district of Maine against the invading British Army and Navy.

Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi has long shown that he is a leader unafraid to attempt deep-rooted rather than superficial changes in policy. The problem he is facing is that the implementing machinery for his bold ideas is much the same rusty, creaky, leaky construct that has held back progress in India during each of the decades that our (severely truncated in 1947) country has been independent. In 2016, both North Block as well as Mint Road made the country an international laughing stock by the manner in which they messed up working out the details of Prime Minister Modi’s move to replace Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes with Rs 2,000 notes and new Rs 500 notes. Confidence in the Reserve Bank of India in particular and the banking system generally fell to levels never seen before in this country, and the daily diet of often contradictory regulatory tweaks did not help either financial stability or institutional credibility. Thanks to such missteps, the entire small sector and much of the medium sector (not to mention the farming community) was deprived of liquidity in a destructive fashion, with the consequence that the annual rate of growth has almost halved since 2016, rather than doubled as was expected in an economy led by Narendra Modi. Next came GST, and here the babus who worked out the details of the PM’s necessary idea jacked up rates to unbearable levels in the name of taxing luxury consumption. Having never run a business in their lives, and having spent almost all their adult lives having a retinue of underlings the exchequer paid for, the bureaucrats involved in DeMo lost sight of the fact that “luxury” goods create employment as much as other products do. Sticking to UPA-era policies and regulations which criminalise the wealthy was certain to cause a slowdown in output and investment, and a consequent fall in employment and therefore in consumer demand. All this has happened, and unless the budget that will be presented next week departs radically from the Sonia-Chidambaram model that successive budgets have followed even after the 2014 victory of the BJP, it is unlikely that India will come anywhere near double digit growth during Modi 2.0. There ought to have been at most two rates for GST and these much lower than the present growth-limiting rates of what ought to have been a transformative reform rather than a blight, especially on the service sector. As designed by North Block, GST made compliance a nightmare. Policy designed by, of and for the babus is not what India needs or what supporters of Prime Minister Modi expect.

Early attempts at deepfakes were amateurish and easy to spot. Manipulated “shallowfakes” have been around for decades. But now AI is reaching the point where it will be virtually impossible to detect audio and video representations of people saying things they never said, or doing things they never did. Seeing will no longer be believing, and we will have to decide for ourselves. If the notion of believing what you see is under attack, this is a huge and serious problem. Realistic yet misleading depictions will be capable of distorting democratic debate, manipulating elections, eroding trust in institutions, weakening journalism, exacerbating social divisions, undermining public safety, and inflicting damage to the reputation of prominent individuals and candidates for office, all of which will be difficult to repair. A deepfake video depicting President Donald Trump ordering the deployment of US forces against North Korea could trigger a nuclear war.
