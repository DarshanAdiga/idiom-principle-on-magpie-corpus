“There is quite a lot of activity going on behind the scenes,” he said. “The big challenge is the exemption level, and for the indoors, that can only happen at Level 2, or below. At the very elite end, the primary concern is the path that plays towards building Tokyo qualification, as the association is keenly aware of that, and doing what they can to make it happen.”

LAGADYN, Carmon November 20th, 2020 It is with tremendous sadness that the family of Carmon Lagadyn, beloved husband of Marion, announces that Carmon passed away peacefully at Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria, British Columbia. Carmon was born in Port Alberni but lived most of his life in Victoria. He was a man of strong faith. He was kind, intelligent and caring, a good man who made many friends throughout his life. He loved his family, most especially his five grandchildren Bella, Lily, Sammi, Avery and Liam, they were the apples of his eyes. He also had two step grandchildren he adored Jaden and Tyler who also loved Grandpa Carmon buying them popsicles on hot summer days after school. Carmon loved camping, boating, fishing, golfing and being anywhere outdoors. He loved Vancouver Island which was his chosen home throughout his life. He worked very hard in his younger days in construction as a bricklayer and many landmark buildings have his handiwork to thank for their artistry, strength and appearance, such as the Empress, the Downtown Library and many others. When he changed careers, he chose to work for many years in health care where his empathy and hard work made him many friends. Carmon was charismatic, funny and interested in many subjects. He was adept at fixing machinery and building; in fact he built his own home from scratch when he was quite young. He was generous to a fault, hard working and empathetic. He was pre-deceased by his very much loved mother, Mary Ellen Lagadyn, (Molly), He leaves behind to mourn his great loss his children, Jeremy, Ryan and Katie, his siblings, Cheryle, Ken, Colin, Lee and his favourite brother in law and good friend Jack Findlay. We would like to thank Dr. Elizabeth Swiggum for her many years of excellent care of Carmon and we also extend thanks to the nurses in the CCU especially James and Sara who tended lovingly to Carmon in his final hours. Please make a memorial donation to the Royal Jubilee Hospital Foundation. Private family service to take place.

Athletics Ireland did manage to stage their National track and field championship back in August, across two weekends and behind closed doors, only since then all competition has been on hold, further restrictions imposed once Level 5 was introduced. According to their own guidelines, all “senior international athletes are defined as elite”, the Government in turn stating “professional, elite sports and senior inter-county Gaelic games, horse-racing and greyhound racing are permitted to continue behind closed doors” even in Level 5.

Sparked by the reminder the National cross-country was originally set for this Sunday, at the wide open fields of Abbotstown, two weeks before the European cross-country at the same venue (the latter already refixed for December 12th, 2021, same time, same place), the debate here was possibly more succinct: while many elite outdoor sports are back up and running, elite Irish athletes still have no racing whatsoever on the horizon.

Which, Kiernan then suggested, isn’t always easy when watching some of the other sports back up and running: “Because as Feidhlim also pointed out, the GAA are having their games, and when they win, there are massive explosions of joy, everybody congregating, hugging and stuff like that, and you’re looking at that thinking, ‘we’re expected to wear masks, behave ourselves’, and these boys are gathering on the field and going crazy.

Carly found the necklace on Avery and was in shock, just as she asked Jax to keep mum who was nervous about keeping a possible game changer to the woman he has fallen for. Jax was quite apprehensive, but he is keeping the secret for now and Nina has seemed to close that door on locating her long lost daughter. In other news, Peter and Maxie seem to think the threat of Alex Devane is over, but I sense that is not the case. The Peter being exposed tale seems to be a on backburner for now, but Dante was reaffirmed to complete the mission courtesy of his doctor who arrived in Port Charles.

However, let’s get back to the main of the hour: Cyrus Renault. When Cyrus first arrived on the scene, I did not see him as a threatening presence, but this guy now has his grip on PC and its residents. I mean he has those glimmers of rage that shake you because it’s great acting people. Cyrus has his claws in so many people, it’s frightening as hell. Dr. Britt being one of them, who is on edge with all the people dying from overdoses. She has built a relationship with Jason Morgan of all people who sees an angle to potentially neutralize Cyrus.
