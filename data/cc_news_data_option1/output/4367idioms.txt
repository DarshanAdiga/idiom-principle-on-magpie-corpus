Two months ago in the wake of the mounting death toll at New Jersey’s veterans homes, the U.S. Department of Justice requested information regarding the spread of COVID-19 in the state-operated nursing homes.
 Rather than provide all the data requested, however, investigators said the state instead referred federal investigators to New Jersey’s website.
 That did not sit well with the Justice Department.
 In a letter to the Murphy administration on Tuesday night, the U.S. Attorney’s office and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said they were launching an investigation into the veterans homes in Menlo Park, Paramus and Vineland under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act.
 “In conducting the investigation, we are obliged to determine whether there are systemic violations of the constitution or laws of the United States in the veterans homes,” wrote U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito and Eric S. Dreiband, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. “Our investigations will focus on whether the veterans homes engage in a pattern or practice of violating the rights of veteran residents under the U.S. Constitution or federal statute by failing to provide them adequate medical care generally, and during the coronavirus pandemic in particular.”
 News of the letter was first reported by Politico New Jersey.
 The governor’s office suggested the announcement was politically motivated.
 “The fact that this request from the Department of Justice was announced a week before Election Day speaks volumes about the nature of the review,” said Michael Zhadanovsky, a spokesman for Gov. Phil Murphy. “From the beginning of the pandemic, the state of New Jersey has relied on CDC guidance from the federal government to protect the residents of our veterans homes.”
 He added that they would not comment on the substance of investigative inquiries and "will respond through the appropriate channels in due course.”
 Zhadanovsky would not respond to questions about what the state did and did not provide the Justice Department in response to its request in August.
 According to the letter from Carpenito, the state website did not contain all of the information requested by his office and the Civil Rights Division.
 “Recent reports suggest that the number of COVID-19 deaths at some nursing homes, including New Jersey Veterans Memorial Home at Menlo Park and New Jersey Veterans Memorial Home at Paramus, two long-term care facilities operated by the state, have been understated,” the U.S. Attorney and Dreiband wrote. “Moreover, our review of publicly available information gives us cause for concern that the quality of medical care at these nursing homes has been deficient.”
 Since the pandemic began, more than 100 residents have died from the coronavirus at the Menlo Park Memorial Veterans Home, according to the state Department of Health — representing about 1 out of every 3 veterans or their spouses at the 312-bed facility in Edison. Menlo Park now has more coronavirus deaths than any nursing home in the state.
 At least 89 residents have died of COVID-19 at the Paramus Veterans Memorial Home. There have been far fewer deaths at Vineland.
 Nearly one in four employees at the Menlo Park and Paramus veterans homes tested positive for the disease, according to the state Military and Veterans Affairs website.
 Earlier this month, the governor announced a major shakeup at the facilities, ousting members of the top leadership. Among them included Brigadier General Jemal J. Beale, the adjutant general who oversees the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. He was replaced on an interim basis by Deputy Adjutant General, Col. Dr. Lisa J. Hou, a surgeon.
 Attorney Paul da Costa of Roseland, who represents more than 50 families who lost loved ones at the veterans homes, as well as several employees who work there, applauded the new inquiry.
 “My clients welcome thorough and transparent investigations by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, as well as the ongoing investigations by the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office,” said da Costa. “These investigations are a necessary step on the road to accountability and full justice.”
 Attorney General Gurbir Grewal’s office earlier this year announced it was conducting an investigation into deaths at all the state’s long-term care facilities, including Paramus and Menlo Park, and has sought records from a Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.
 Veterans groups along with dozens of healthcare workers and relatives of residents who died at Menlo Park held a vigil outside the Menlo Park home last month, demanding an investigation into what happened there.
