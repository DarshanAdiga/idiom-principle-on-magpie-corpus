This pandemic allows us to critically examine the stark differences between conservative (Republican) and liberal (Democrat) philosophy and ideology.
 Conservatism places the responsibility for health and safety on the individual; whereas under Liberalism the government decides and dictates what is best for the citizenry. This contrast explains why officials and organizations so strongly oppose President Donald Trump.
 His decisions, policies, accomplishments, and rhetoric fly in the face of the controlling “old guard”. He fearlessly challenges the “Goliaths” of old power house elitist career politicians, global business interests, media and social establishments. Their hate of the President is stoked by the strong passionate support of the common man.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Four men have appeared in court for the first time on charges related to the death of a Philadelphia police officer shot as police were trying to serve a warrant earlier this year. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that a judge Tuesday heard testimony from the first officer who entered the home in the Frankford neighborhood March 13. He said he loudly announced that police were there to serve a warrant but officers were fired upon almost immediately as they climbed the stairs to the second floor. Cpl. James O’Connor IV, a 46-year-old member of the SWAT team, was shot in the shoulder above his bulletproof vest. O'Connor, who was posthumously promoted to sergeant, was pronounced dead shortly afterward at a hospital. Two other people in the home were wounded by return fire from another officer. Authorities have said evidence recovered at the scene indicated that 16 shots were fired at the officers and one of the SWAT team members returned fire. Twenty-two-year-old Hassan Elliot, accused of having fired the fatal shot, faces murder, attempted homicide and weapons charges. He's also charged in the 2019 slaying that sent officers to the home with an arrest warrant as well as in a December shooting in the same neighborhood. A call seeking comment was made to his attorney Tuesday. Two other defendants are charged with murder under the conspiracy act, with prosecutors alleging that the three are members of a violent street gang. One also faces drug counts and the other also faces murder charges in a separate slaying. A fourth defendant faces weapons counts. O'Connor, a married father of two — including a son who also serves on the force — had been a police officer for 23 years and was with the SWAT unit for 15 years. His daughter serves in the U.S. Air Force.

MADISON, Wis. — Vice President Mike Pence defended President Donald Trump's nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court and his response to the coronavirus pandemic at an outdoor rally Tuesday in a conservative Milwaukee suburb before a crowd of supporters, most of whom were not wearing masks or socially distancing even as COVID-19 cases broke records in Wisconsin.
 The rally at Weldall Manufacturing in Waukesha came exactly three weeks before the election and as the Senate Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's pick to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.
 “I'm going to make a prediction,” Pence said. “Judge Amy Coney Barrett will soon be Justice Amy Coney Barrett. We're going to fill that seat.”
 Pence said Democrat Joe Biden would “pack the court” if he is elected president by adding seats to the Supreme Court. Biden has avoided questions for weeks about the idea that's been pushed by liberals and used by Republicans against him. On Monday, Biden said in Cincinnati that he was “not a fan” of adding seats but did not want to get distracted by the issue.
 Pressure on Biden to respond intensified after his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, refused to answer the question during her debate with Pence last week.
 Pence also promised to eradicate what he called the “China virus," a description Trump has also repeatedly used when referring to the coronavirus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, before it spread across the world.
 Biden campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield, ahead of Pence’s visit to Wisconsin, faulted him for not doing more to control the pandemic in role as head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
 “President Trump has shown a reckless disregard for the lives and livelihood of the American people — and nowhere is that more clear than in Wisconsin,” Bedingfield said. “As coronavirus infections, hospitalizations, and deaths surge across the state, the Trump Administration still doesn’t have a plan to beat the virus.”
 Cases of COVID-19 have surged in Wisconsin in recent weeks, with the state hitting new daily highs Tuesday for newly confirmed cases and deaths. The number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 hit a record high of 950 on Monday, the state announced plans last week to open a field hospital to handle overflow patients and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers imposed new capacity limits for indoors.
 Republicans in Wisconsin are suing to overturn the state's mask mandate issued by Evers and GOP lawmakers are also working to undo the capacity limits.
 Pence was the highest profile of Trump surrogates who were in battleground Wisconsin this week. His son Eric Trump was in the state on Monday and his daughter Ivanka Trump also campaigned in Wisconsin on Tuesday.
 Trump was scheduled to be in Janesville on Saturday for a fundraiser. His campaign has not said whether there will be any public events. Trump resumed campaigning on Monday after being quarantined at the White House following his positive test for the coronavirus.
 Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, renewed his criticism of Trump holding rallies in the state with large crowds of people who don't wear masks or socially distance. He said that administering temperature checks is not a sufficient way to screen for the virus and just handing out masks doesn't mean that people will actually put them on.
 Few states are as important to the president’s prospects as Wisconsin, which Trump carried by less than 23,000 votes out of nearly 3 million cast in 2016. Wisconsin had not voted for a Republican for president in more than a generation before that.

“We hope that the Supreme Court will do the right thing and allow election officials to count all valid ballots cast by election day, even if ballots are delayed in the mail and arrive a few days later,” said Farbod Faraji, an attorney at Protect Democracy, a Washington, D.C.-based group assisting Democrats with the lawsuit. “But voters should not count on that. Everyone voting absentee should submit their ballot as early as possible, so that their municipal clerk receives it no later than 8 p.m. on Nov. 3rd.”
 The planned request for the Supreme Court to take the case comes amid confirmation hearings for conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett, whom Trump selected to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon. While Barrett’s nomination is pending, the Supreme Court has a 5-3 conservative majority.
 There are numerous similar fights over absentee ballots happening in other battleground states.

While resistance from the law and economics community undoubtedly played an important part in shaping the Project’s final form, the critical opposition ultimately came from corporate practitioners. Many corporate practitioners undoubtedly perceived legitimate policy objections to the Project, but there was another force at work: self-interest. In the long run, a lawyer’s self- interest points towards expansive judicial review. Rational members of the plaintiff’s bar prefer rules throwing open the courthouse doors. So too should rational litigators within the corporate bar, given that defending lawsuits is almost as profitable as bringing them in the first instance. Even transactional lawyers have a strong interest in frequent judicial review of their client’s conduct, given that it is the threat of litigation that makes transactional lawyers necessary to those clients. Because most observers believed that the Project would significantly increase the amount of corporate litigation, long-run self-interest thus should have led practitioners to support the Project.

The authors point to a greater risk if steps aren’t taken in the near term to avert exponentially increasing economic damage in the long term — and made permanent so they’re in place for future pandemics.
 “Recessions feed on themselves,” they write. “Workers not at work have less to spend, and thus subsequent business revenue declines.” By placing thousands of dollars in the hands of families and augmenting unemployment benefits, the CARES Act averted what might well have metastasized into “what likely would have been a new Great Depression.”
 But the course of the pandemic is still unknown, and the U.S. response becalmed in the doldrums, at least for the moment. The lesson of this pandemic is that among the flaws of the U.S. healthcare system is that it focuses on treating acute conditions as they arise, “with far less spending on public health services and infrastructure.”
 Assuming that the government will eventually establish systems of testing and contact tracing that will stem the transmission of this virus, dismantling them once COVID-19 is defeated will be a disastrous mistake. The U.S. hasn’t learned from its past encounters with global health crises. This one is the worst in American history; will its lessons finally take?

Cristiano Ronaldo has become the latest international soccer star to test positive for the coronavirus. The Portuguese soccer federation said Tuesday that Ronaldo was doing well and had no symptoms after he tested positive while with his country's national team. He was in isolation and was dropped from the country’s Nations League match against Sweden on Wednesday in Lisbon. “Ronaldo is doing great. He is dealing very well with this,” Portugal coach Fernando Santos said. “He is asymptomatic, he has no problems. He doesn't even know how this happened to him.\" Ronaldo, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the sport's history, played in the 0-0 draw at France in the Nations League on Sunday and in the 0-0 draw against Spain in a friendly last week. On Monday, the Juventus forward posted a photo on Twitter and Instagram showing him and the rest of the Portugal squad having a meal together. The players were all close to each other at a table, with a smiling Ronaldo apparently taking the photo himself at the front end. Along with the tweet, Ronaldo wrote, in Portuguese, “United on and off the field!” Photos published by Portuguese media showed Ronaldo on a balcony overlooking his teammates practicing below on a field at the national team's training center. In one of the images, he was shown giving the thumbs-up sign. The 35-year-old Ronaldo last month became only the second male soccer player to reach 100 goals for a national team, after former Iran striker Ali Daei. Players who tested positive for COVID-19 recently include Neymar, Kylian Mbappé, Paul Pogba, Paulo Dybala, Ángel Di María, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Diego Costa.

 Then, last year, she was referred by a judge to the county’s DUI court program, one of a few initiatives that offers an alternative to time behind bars for those dealing with substance abuse issues. Before that referral, Laura, a lifetime Cheyenne resident who was granted confidentiality by the WTE due to personal conflicts, had never gotten to attend counseling due to its high costs.

Independent monitors have paused enrollment in a study testing the COVID-19 antiviral drug remdesivir plus an experimental antibody therapy being developed by Eli Lilly that’s similar to a treatment President Donald Trump recently received. Lilly confirmed Tuesday that the study had been paused “out of an abundance of caution” and said safety is its top concern. The company would not say more about what led to this step. The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsors the study, would not immediately comment. Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. The experimental drugs are concentrated versions of one or two specific antibodies that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests. This study was testing a single antibody that Lilly is developing with the Canadian company AbCellera. Trump received an experimental two-antibody combo drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Lilly and Regeneron have asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization for their drugs for COVID-19 while late-stage studies continue. The paused study, called ACTIV-3, started in August and aims to enroll 10,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States, Denmark and Singapore. All are given remdesivir, which has been authorized in the U.S. as an emergency treatment for COVID-19, plus either the Lilly antibody or a placebo. The main goals are reducing the need for extra oxygen and time to recovery. Deaths, relief of symptoms and other measures also are being tracked. All of the drugs are given through an IV.

BERLIN — An anti-corruption watchdog on Tuesday ranked the United States and United Kingdom as the largest exporters most active at enforcing rules meant to prohibit companies from paying bribes in foreign markets, but said many others are doing next to nothing.
 Berlin-based Transparency International said only four of 47 countries — the U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Israel, making up 16.5% of global exports — were actively enforcing legislation against foreign bribery in 2019.
 That's down from seven countries, making up 27% of exports, that were conducting active enforcement in 2018.
 “Our research shows that many countries are barely investigating foreign bribery,” said Gillian Dell, the lead author of the Transparency report. “Unfortunately, it’s all too common for businesses in wealthy countries to export corruption to poorer countries, undermining institutions and development.”
 The 1997 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development convention prohibits bribes to win contracts and licenses, or to dodge taxes and local laws.
 China, the world's largest exporter and not a signatory to the convention, was found to conduct “little or no enforcement,” in a category that also includes India, and convention members Japan and Korea.
 Germany, the world's third-largest exporter and also signatory to the convention, only conducts “moderate enforcement,” as do other major exporters like France, Italy and Spain.
 Germany and Italy both pursued fewer cases in 2019 than in the previous year, while France and Spain improved their performance.
 The Netherlands, Canada and Austria — all signatories to the convention — are the biggest exporters in the category of those showing only “limited enforcement.”
 “Too many governments choose to turn a blind eye when their companies use bribery to win business in foreign markets," Transparency International head Delia Ferreira Rubio said. “G-20 countries and other major economies have a responsibility to enforce the rules.”
 Transparency's recommendations include ending secrecy in ownership of companies, which makes investigating foreign bribery difficult, and exploring increased liability of parent companies for the actions of their foreign subsidiaries.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — It will be up to New Mexico voters to decide the future of a powerful commission in charge of regulating utilities and other businesses. A constitutional amendment on the ballot proposes changing the Public Regulation Commission from elected to governor-appointed members. Supporters say the change would ensure that commissioners are experienced regulators rather than politicians. As of now, they say there's unbridled influence from environmental and industry lobbyists working to sway commissioners' votes. Opponents call it a power grab by the governor that would eliminate voters' ability to elect their own representatives. Commission Chairman Steve Fischmann is among those with concerns. He said the ballot language is misleading because it doesn’t tell voters that current law calls for commissioners to be elected. The measure states new appointees would be selected by the governor from a list of qualified nominees, asking voters to change the law without giving clarity on the process as it stands now. He also noted that the governor and state lawmakers run political action committees that often take large contributions from utilities that could influence the selection of appointees. “It has morphed from a good government initiative into a political power play,” he said in a statement late last week. “The governor and legislative leaders have no business driving the selection of PRC commissioners until they insulate themselves permanently and completely from utility money.” Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, D-Santa Fe, said the elected commission still sees money coming in from all sides. “It’s turned the commission into a matter of who has the most leverage and power to win elections, rather than who can do the best job as a...

In Laramie County, the DA’s office will also be unable to handle educational neglect cases, which arise when parents aren’t getting their children, typically in elementary school, to class consistently. Like with CHINS, educational neglect cases prove useful for child advocates to determine what is happening inside a home.
 “If a parent is struggling to get their kids to school, what are the reasons?” said Storey-Huylar. “If you are harming a child, if you are abusing a child, you’re less likely to want the kid to go to school. ... And we know, statistically, that schools are where kids disclose abuse.”
 In Natrona County, a popular student court program that aims to keep minors out of the criminal justice system will also likely cease to exist, according to Itzen.
 “We have a number of specialty courts – like a drug court, a student court – that are pretty successful,” Itzen said. “We’re going to have to pull out of those, because we simply won’t have the manpower to keep those running.”
 Itzen added graduation rates have risen every year since the student court program began in Natrona County.
 “It holds them accountable for their actions, but it also has immediate and swift consequences, and the kids respond to that program extremely well,” Itzen said. “If we can save kids from being in the criminal justice system, we’re (saving) money down the road, and we’re going to lose that ability.”
 Though no such student court program exists in Laramie County, the cuts’ effects will be severe nonetheless, according to Storey-Huylar, who also serves as a board member for Laramie County School District 1.
 “If you don’t have tools in your toolbox to be able to help the most vulnerable of our population, which are kids, if you don’t have tools, if your hands are tied, if money is taken away, then we don’t have the ability to intervene,” Storey-Huylar said. “So there’s no magic solution here.”
 “Children are going to be the silent impact of this, because a little 2-year- old who’s living in a home where there is drugs and alcohol that are prolific can’t advocate for themselves,” she continued. “And if the system can’t file on that parent to help them get help, then the child is going to be left in that home, unprotected and silently impacted.”
 The initial round of cuts completed this summer has already strained the district attorneys’ offices. But with Gov. Mark Gordon planning to unveil another phase of reductions sometime this fall, attorneys will probably be laid off in the next round of cuts, according to Manlove and Itzen.
 “Even though it may not sound like very much, 5%, 10%, 20%, when you’re a really small entity, like my office, and your workload is such that we were at the tipping point already, we didn’t have anything else to cut,” Manlove said. “There was nothing else that we could not do that was extra.”
 Itzen said his office will lose another two to three employees from the next round of cuts. “What that means is we won’t be able to prosecute as many cases,” Itzen said. “We prosecute about 3,500 cases a year, and we just can’t keep that number up. There’ll be crimes that go unprosecuted, victims that go unserved.”
 Along with a lack of prosecutors able to participate, the state’s treatment courts will also face separate funding challenges through the cuts. Zunker said the first round of cuts hasn’t dismantled the Laramie County treatment programs.
 “But if there’s additional cuts that may be coming later this fall or into this winter, that’s going to have some drastic effects on the operations of our programs here in Laramie County,” Zunker said.
 Beyond that, several officials questioned whether the cuts to the court system would really translate to long-term savings. For example, the 2016 report on Laramie County’s treatment programs found the drop in arrests experienced by drug court graduates saved taxpayers more than $33,000 in estimated jail expenses, while the reduction in arrests experienced by DUI court graduates was projected to have saved taxpayers more than $78,000 in jail costs.
 “With the budget cuts, I understand where the governor’s at on that, but at the end of the day, they’re not really helpful to anything,” said Zunker. “It just kicks the can down the road.”
 The governor, of course, has a constitutional mandate to produce a balanced budget, and without the revenue to fund programs like Zunker’s, he has little choice but to cut some initiatives. Michael Pearlman, a spokesman for the governor, said Gordon will discuss his supplemental budget during a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting Oct. 26.
 “Right now, all agencies are looking at further cuts because the budget deficit is so severe, and the governor must propose a balanced budget to the Legislature in November,” Pearlman said in a written response to questions. “So the policy implications of cuts will soon be with the Legislature, which has the responsibility to get involved in these complex and challenging decisions.”
 Indeed, some solutions could emerge during the Wyoming Legislature’s general session, set to begin in January, as lawmakers will ultimately have to determine their funding priorities due to the scale of the revenue shortfall.
 Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, who co-chairs the Joint Judiciary Committee, said most Wyomingites, including legislators, don’t have much exposure to the state’s criminal justice system, creating somewhat of a disconnect on court- related issues.
 “Whereas all of the Legislature is aware that every state agency is being cut and there are consequences all around ... I don’t know that the court system is rising above some of the others that we’re hearing about,” said Nethercott.
 There are aspects of the judicial system that Nethercott hoped she and her colleagues could look at next session. She mentioned the state requirement for prosecutors to be involved in DUI and drug courts as an example of something that could potentially be tweaked “to accomplish the same goal with less resources.”
 “I do think there might be smarter ways, as a result of some of these budgets cuts, that we can still effectively administer these important programs,” Nethercott said.
 Though the initial round of cuts has been run through the executive branch, lawmakers will soon have a more hands-on role with the release of Gordon’s supplemental budget next month.
 “As we continue to review the cuts that we’re doing, we’re going to have to really understand, beyond the 10%, what that loss means, and what the community and the state can actually bear,” Nethercott said. “Is the non- prosecution of some criminal misdemeanors acceptable to society, or do they want to prioritize that over something else?”
 Given the scale of the revenue shortfall facing Wyoming, Itzen was not optimistic about the chances of funding being restored to his office in the near future.
 “I think it’s a pipe dream, frankly, to talk about your budget getting restored anytime soon,” he said. “I hope they look at these smaller agencies and what we give to our citizens across the state and realize that it’s not worth cutting our budgets for what the state gets from us.”
 Manlove, likewise, said the cuts tie directly to how residents view their communities. Her hope is that the public and policymakers can have discussions on the impacts before it’s too late.
 “I just believe that there are consequences when there is no accountability,” Manlove said. “And when you see it manifesting, when it’s at that point, gosh, how do you put the genie back in the bottle?”

MADISON, Wis. — Democrats and their allies said Tuesday they will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether absentee ballots in battleground Wisconsin that are received up to six days after the election can be counted — a move being fought by Republicans who have opposed other attempts across the country to expand voting.
 Democrats argue that the flood of absentee ballots and other challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic make it necessary to extend the period in which ballots can be counted. Wisconsin is one of the nation's hot spots for COVID-19, with hospitalizations treating a record high number of patients with the disease.
 Republicans oppose the extension, saying voters have plenty of opportunities to cast their ballot by the close of polls on Election Day and that the rules should not be changed so close to the election.
 A federal judge in September sided with Democrats and said ballots postmarked by Election Day, Nov. 3, could be counted if they're received by Nov. 9. The judge also ruled that poll workers could include people from outside the county, a change Democrats wanted in order to make it easier to fill vacancies. The judge’s ruling also extended the state’s deadline for registering by mail or electronically by seven days, from Wednesday until Oct. 21.
 The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling, but last week put the lower court's decision on hold pending further appeals.
 “We hope that the Supreme Court will do the right thing and allow election officials to count all valid ballots cast by Election Day, even if ballots are delayed in the mail and arrive a few days later," said Farbod Faraji, an attorney at Protect Democracy, a Washington, D.C.-based group assisting Democrats with the lawsuit. “But voters should not count on that. Everyone voting absentee should submit their ballot as early as possible, so that their municipal clerk receives it no later than 8:00 pm on November 3rd.”
 The planned request for the Supreme Court to take the case comes amid confirmation hearings for conservative Amy Coney Barrett, whom President Donald Trump selected to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon. While Barrett's nomination is pending, the Supreme Court has a 5-3 conservative majority.
 There are numerous similar fights over absentee ballots happening in other battleground states.
 In neighboring Minnesota on Monday, a federal judge upheld a state court agreement that allows the counting of absentee ballots received up to seven days after Election Day. In Michigan, Republicans are appealing a ruling that extended the deadline to receive mail ballots postmarked before Election Day to Nov. 17. And in Pennsylvania, Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court to put a hold on a ruling that extends the deadline for counting and receiving mail-in ballots. In North Carolina, several Republican lawsuits challenge a settlement in which the state elections board agreed to change the way defective mail ballots can be fixed by voters.
 There is also a federal lawsuit in North Carolina related to witness signature requirements for absentee ballots.
 In Wisconsin, absentee ballots typically must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. But this year, as many as two-thirds of all ballots, or roughly 2 million, are projected to be cast absentee, which Democrats fear will overwhelm local election officials. Absentee ballots can't be counted in Wisconsin until 7 a.m. on Election Day. A group of Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday called for Republicans who control the Legislature to convene a special session to change the law before Election Day. Republicans have rejected earlier calls to change the law.
 Democrats cite problems in Wisconsin's April presidential primary election, including long lines at the polls and thousands of ballots mailed after the election, as reasons to grant an extension. They also argue that potential delays in mail delivery could cause the late arrival of ballots.
 As of Tuesday, 717,000 of more than 1.3 million requested absentee ballots had been returned. To date, the returned absentee ballots account for nearly 24% of the total vote of more than 3 million ballots in 2016.
 President Donald Trump won Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point — fewer than 23,000 votes — in 2016. Polls show Democratic challenger Joe Biden with a slight lead in the state, but both sides expect another close race. Three of the past five presidential elections in Wisconsin were decided by less than a percentage point.
 Those suing to receive the extension are the Democratic National Committee; the Wisconsin Democratic Party; the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin; Disability Rights Wisconsin; and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, a Milwaukee-based advocacy group working to defeat Trump.
 The Republican National Committee, the Wisconsin Republican Party and state Republican lawmakers are fighting the lawsuit.

"Ronaldo is doing great. He is dealing very well with this," Portugal coach Fernando Santos said. "He is asymptomatic, he has no problems. He doesn't even know how this happened to him."
 Ronaldo, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the sport's history, played in the 0-0 draw at France in the Nations League on Sunday and in the 0-0 draw against Spain in a friendly last week.
 On Monday, the Juventus forward posted a photo on Twitter and Instagram showing him and the rest of the Portugal squad having a meal together. The players were all close to each other at a table, with a smiling Ronaldo apparently taking the photo himself at the front end.
 Along with the tweet, Ronaldo wrote, in Portuguese, "United on and off the field!"
 Photos published by Portuguese media showed Ronaldo on a balcony overlooking his teammates practicing below on a field at the national team's training center. In one of the images, he was shown giving the thumbs-up sign.
 The 35-year-old Ronaldo last month became only the second male soccer player to reach 100 goals for a national team, after former Iran striker Ali Daei.
 Players who tested positive for COVID-19 recently include Neymar, Kylian Mbappé, Paul Pogba, Paulo Dybala, Ángel Di María, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Diego Costa.
 The Portuguese federation said Ronaldo's result prompted another round of tests for the rest of the national squad. It said everyone else in the team tested negative.
