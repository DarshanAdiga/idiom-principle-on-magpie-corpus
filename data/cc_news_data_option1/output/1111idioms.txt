Dental hygienists say some dentists are ignoring national guidelines and recommendations to postpone non-emergency procedures including cleanings and fillings during the COVID-19 crisis, putting hygienists and patients, particularly older people, at dire risk.
 The American Dental Association, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Southboro-based Massachusetts Dental Society have recommended that dentists postpone non-emergency and elective procedures until at least April 6. Dentists would continue to be available for emergency care.
 Katherine Soal of Hudson, spokesperson for the 7,000-plus-member Massachusetts Dental Hygienists Association, said the group is reaching out to legislators and state officials to mandate that dentists stop doing non-emergency procedures while the highly contagious coronavirus is a deadly threat. Soal is past president of the MDHA and a professor of dental hygiene at Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester, where she is senior clinical coordinator.
 Soal said she is getting "pushback" from the association, but that her voice has to be heard to protect hygienists and the public.
 "I've heard that there are many dental offices across the state that are open and doing elective procedures. We're hoping to get some messages to the Legislature that we need to shut vendors down unless it's for an emergency procedure," she said. "These are recommendations that are out now. But until they (dentists) get that mandate, they're going to do what they want."
 Sen. Joanne M. Comerford, D-Northampton, and Rep. John J. Mahoney, D-Worcester, co-chairs of the Legislature's Joint Committee on Public Health, did not readily respond to phone calls and emails seeking information about what might be in the works in the Legislature to address the concerns of the dental hygienists.
 A spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Health and Human Services said a team is working to finalize guidance and recommendations for dentists and dental hygienists that likely will be published before the end of the week.
 Soal said organized dentistry should have taken care of this proactively and should not have had to be asked to not do non-emergency procedures during this time. Hygienists, she said, should be able to work in safety and be able to keep patients safe. She noted that there is a high risk of transmission of the coronavirus and other diseases during dental procedures, particularly with the close and personal interaction between providers and patients.
 "It doesn't matter how well you think you're covered up and protected, there will always be breaches," she said.
 Soal said some hygienists are also being required to use the same protective mask all day for different patients. They are told to sterilize the masks in an autoclave, but she said that reduces their efficacy.
 "Dentists need to stop the greed and protect the public. This isn't just about dental hygienists. It's about the public," she continued. "Nobody needs to have their teeth cleaned right now. Oral health is important, but get a little floss action going on in the meantime."
 She said the masks and gloves would better be utilized by making them available to medical professionals who are working with people who have possibly contracted COVID-19 or are dealing with other serious conditions.
 People who answered the phones at several dental offices Wednesday- including Levenson Smile and Grace Family Dental and Gentle Dental on Shrewsbury Street, all in Worcester - said they are following the public health guidelines to postpone non-emergency services.
 Salman Khanani, owner of Khanani Family Dental in Holden, said it's tough for him because he just bought the practice seven months ago, but it is the right thing to do to protect his staff and the community.
 "As a small-business owner, it's tough to stop revenue streams. But you've got to do what's best for the community at large, especially with COVID-19. A lot of carriers are asymptomatic and they could spread the disease. We have a lot of older patients," Khanani said.
 The phone to his Holden office forwards to his cellphone so that patients can call if they need emergency services. On Thursday, he plans to meet patients in his office to deal with severe toothaches.
 Serving patients with severe oral problems such as abscesses can prevent them from going to an emergency room, where doctors are dealing with patients who might have COVID-19 other serious health conditions, he said.
 Soal also said she has heard from some hygienists who say they are afraid to not follow their employer's instructions because they may be fired. Some said they were told they could not apply for unemployment yet and that they will be told when they can.
 When asked, Khanani said he has not looked into whether his seven employees can sign up for unemployment. He would not say if he is continuing to pay their salaries.
 Kathleen McKeon, spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Dental Society,said the MDS "always advises dentists to follow all regulations issued by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Board of Registration in Dentistry, along with all infection control guidelines provided by the CDC."
 Also, in a statement, the Massachusetts Dental Society said: "The vast majority of our members welcomed guidance from the MDS, and we received an overwhelmingly positive response to our strong recommendation that dentists practicing in the Commonwealth close their offices from March 17 to April 6 to patients seeking elective and non-urgent care."

Darius Slay got what he was waiting for — a trade out of Detroit and a big new contract.
 The Lions agreed to trade Slay to the Philadelphia Eagles, ending the standout cornerback’s seven-year stint in Detroit. Agent Drew Rosenhaus confirmed the trade Thursday and that Slay agreed to a three-year, $50 million extension with Philadelphia.
 The Lions drafted Slay 36th overall in 2013, and he earned All-Pro honors in 2017. Slay wanted a new contract before last season and did not attend Detroit’s mandatory minicamp. He ended up reporting to training camp and played well enough to earn a third Pro Bowl nod.
 Still, if there were any doubts about Slay’s wishes for the future, they seemed to be dispelled Wednesday night after ESPN reported that Detroit had reached an agreement with cornerback Desmond Trufant. Slay tweeted that he wanted out.

While yielding a glimmer of hope to student-athletes is very much appreciated, the problem now, as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus nationwide increases rapidly by the day, is the glimmer needs to be focused on one place.
 Reasonably and seemingly, with all the logistical and circumstantial challenges of expecting state-qualifying winter athletes to come back after, at minimum, several weeks of hiatus — it's just not feasible.
 And we feel horrible for those communities, teams and student-athletes whose postseasons were cut short. They deserved their moment.
 But with the people who would know telling us daily that — maybe — we'll start to return to some slight semblance of normalcy by May, it's time to focus that glimmer of hope on the spring student-athletes whose seasons haven't even commenced.
 One other thing Snodgrass mentioned, which needs to be pointed out here, was his rightful indignation over an attempted workaround on the travel baseball circuit.
 Snodgrass stated it was brought to his attention someone in Ohio tried to organize a league for baseball players locked out of their spring practice and season preparation and call it "corona baseball."
 Really?!
 The point right now as a society is to stay home and, unfortunately, whoever thought that was a bright idea swung at a curve ball, missed and toppled over in a heap. Here's to hoping that concept never got past running out of the batter's box.
 As we all remain in a holding pattern — and for spring sports, this can be discussed in more detail when it's necessary — here is the best-case scenario:
 Conduct an abbreviated regular-season competition in May by sport following a one- or two-week practice period, centered around your conference in order to get some reps in before the postseason. Maybe have a conference tournament for baseball or softball or a conference meet for track and field — and that's it. Then proceed with the postseason in late May as scheduled.
 If measures are needed to still control mass gathering, then so be it.
 And if it's required for the sake of public health to not conduct spring sports at all — heartbreaking as that concept may be — then don't.
 We obviously have much more important considerations as a world community right now.
 So kudos to Snodgrass and the OHSAA for leaving a glimmer of hope. If you scroll through social media, that's pretty much all spring student-athletes are requesting — the possibility they can get going eventually, not closing the window entirely.
 That's all anyone can ask.
 But as we battle a worldwide pandemic, the likes of which we've never seen, we have to be realistic.
 It's not about sports.
 It's about taking care of each other.
 There's a lot of people, after all, who want to make sure their "Grampa" gets out of this all right, too — even if we have to walk around in a circle for the time being.

“Nothing is glossed over on this show. Every character is dealing with their own situation and their own problem. There’s no underlying idea that everyone is the same and going through the same thing,” Bryant said. “I think it’s truly important to have people see themselves on screen in a way where they can fully relate to it.”
 Of all the characters in the series, Brad is one of the least likable. He has few redeeming qualities, as someone who cheats on his girlfriend, emotionally manipulates her, and also goes head-to-head with our heroine, Sydney. Ellis, who plays Brad, said his character is one example of how the show aims to reach younger audiences with a more authentic message about how being a teenager isn’t always a positive experience — there are bullies, there are hardships, but you can still work through it.
 “ _I Am Not Okay With This_ isn’t a glamorized high school experience,” Ellis said. “l think the show does a really good job of making it so that the characters aren’t in a fairy tale. It’s real, it’s intimate, and it shows that no one is perfect.”
 While Ellis’s character isn’t a great source of inspiration, he said that he looks to Sydney and her adolescent transformation as an important role model for viewers. Sydney’s superpowers are a metaphor, he said, for learning how to adapt to what life throws at you and embracing whatever it is that makes you unique and different.
 “Ultimately, it’s OK to be exactly who you are,” Ellis said. “And as soon as you can accept that and come to terms with all of that, you can be really happy.”

Are we having fun yet?
 There's nothing like a pandemic to throw your world into perspective, huh?
 My daughter came home on Friday for spring break. Yay, right? We all know how much I miss her, so anytime she comes home, my spirits are high.
 Well, mid-week came the news that her break got extended a week. And, ominously, her college said they'd reassess and might have to go to online classes only. My first reaction was "yesssssss!" Freshman year would be cut short, and I'd have more time with my kid.
 But as the days have gone by, I realize I was being selfish. My poor daughter is legitimately bummed. If she can't go back to school, she also can't run her first season of college spring track. She never got a chance to say goodbye to friends. She's stuck hanging around with us, and not enjoying her semi- newfound independent life at school. Lo and behold, she's grown into quite a responsible, capable adult in just a few months!
 Don't get me wrong, I agree with the decision. I just want my family to be safe. One missed quarter of college is not going to make or break my kid. But it helped her when I started looking at the situation from her perspective.
 And now I'm prepping four newsrooms to work remotely for three weeks, which is a weird thing for journalists. While everyone else is hunkering down, we've got to be out reporting on this so that our readers have the most up-to-date information. Like with snowstorms and floods and all manner of natural disaster, my staff is right in the middle of it instead of safe at home. (That said, we are incredibly proud of our role and wouldn't change a thing!)
 Like with my daughter, a few weeks isn't going to break us. Heck, even if it extends a few months, we will be OK. There are positives, you just have to try a different perspective. My staff is going to become adept at working remotely. My family is going to get some extra time together, just us.
 And boy are we all going to have stories to tell 30 years from now.

Former Spanish European Cup-winning midfielder Joaquin Peiró has passed away at the age of 84.
 Peiró, who won the 1961/62 UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup and two Copa del Rey crowns with Atlético Madrid, was one of the first Spanish players to earn his living outside of the country, and was a key part of the Inter Milan side who won the 1965 UEFA European Champion Clubs' Cup, as well as two European-South American Cup titles that decade.
 He enjoyed a 25-year coaching career with several sides across Spain, most notably enjoying success with Málaga, whom he led to promotion in the Liga in 1999 before winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2002. He also led the Andalusian side to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup the following season.
 “With the loss of Joaquín Peiró, the Atlético family loses another of those who gave their all for this club both on and off the pitch,” Atlético said in a statement. “From the club, the president and the board send their deepest condolences to his family and friends.”
 Peiro earned 12 caps for Spain, playing in the 1962 and 1966 World Cups, and scored five goals for his country.

ESPN, citing an unidentified source, reported that the Lions will receive 2020 draft picks in the third and fifth rounds for Slay.
 The Eagles needed help in the secondary. Cornerback Ronald Darby is not expected to return, and the team is not bringing back safety Malcolm Jenkins. Philadelphia had the cap space and draft picks available to pull off a move like this.
 Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz was Detroit’s coach when Slay was a rookie in 2013.
 The Lions are overhauling a defense that ranked 31st in the league last season. Detroit agreed to a two-year deal with defensive tackle Danny Shelton and a trade bringing safety Duron Harmon to the Lions from New England.
 Detroit has also reportedly agreed to deals with Trufant, linebacker Jamie Collins and defensive tackle Nick Williams. An NFL Network reporter, citing an unidentified source, reported Thursday that the Lions had a one-year agreement with safety Jayron Kearse.
 The Lions released defensive tackle Damon Harrison and linebacker Devon Kennard.
 This could be a make-or-break year for Detroit coach Matt Patricia, who is 9-22-1 after two seasons at the helm. The defensive struggles have been particularly jarring, since Patricia was a defensive coordinator with New England before taking over the Lions.

One or both of those backs might still be chosen ahead of Taylor, but his combination of speed and size caused scouts to change their thinking on whether he can be an every-down back who can carry the load on offense, making it more likely that some team will draft him in the first round, where the big money is.

Jenna Zapata, 22, is a social media manager, photographer, and soon-to-be creative director of Zig Zag Galleries in Denison. She moved to Denison 7 months ago with her fur baby Bentley, a 3-year-old Bernese mountain dog, from Frisco.
   
 Zig Zag Galleries is a contemporary and fine art gallery that features art from a variety of mediums- representing artists from the community and beyond. Zig Zag Galleries represents Zapata Image Gallery and Zapata Art Gallery. The vision of Zig Zag Galleries is to work with artists within the community- regardless of age, sexuality, gender, race or levels of experience- in order to create a safe art space that allows people to experience in every way possible. Zig Zag Galleries is open to all types of artists whether established or not. Zapata established the gallery with the desire to allow all styles of visual arts and allow them to have a place to be exhibited and celebrated. Zig Zag Galleries will encourage the community to grow with art. They want to provide a location for artists to collaborate and share their experiences visually, along with a workshop space for collaborative events and classes. The gallery will also have a small shop of fun, handpicked and handmade vintage finds and gifts.
   
 "We focus on allowing the freedom of expression while starting complex conversations about art. We do all of this for our community, which inspires us to share our love for art with one another. We want to provide the best artistic experience we have to offer." adds Zapata
   
 Jenna Zapata views photography as an art form and expressed an interest in it from an early age. She started with a point and shoot camera and then progressed to a digital camera and learned to develop her personal visions and ideas from the beauty she saw around her. She received numerous awards at local, state and national level competitions and sold her first photograph in an art gallery in seventh grade.
   
 "I couldn't believe someone would want to purchase my art, let alone want to display it in their home. At that point, I started to wonder why other kids my age weren't entering art galleries. I realized that there was a huge misconception about art galleries and artist culture in Frisco," adds Zapata
   
 Jenna set out to attend Santa Fe University of Art and Design and to pursue a degree in Business Art Administration. Unfortunately, following her freshman year in 2017 the school unexpectedly closed. She found herself without a university or a degree. Not to be deterred she took the setback as an opportunity to grown her field and she eventually received her associate's degree in art from Collin College in Frisco
   
 "We actually found the building at that time. I believe everything happens for a reason and I am lucky to have friends and family who support me, and my dreams; especially my parents who have been my biggest supporters." she says
   
 Zapata feels that most people see art as an exclusive community for collectors and elitist, but art galleries allow for a space in which is tangible, creative and diverse-allowing anyone to participate no matter their age or monetary status.
   
 "After realizing the fallacy between art and everyday people, I made it my mission to help guide and inspire other artists. I wanted people to feel comfortable growing and promoting themselves as artists regardless of age or talent. I worked with middle and high school students in the Frisco Independent School District and helped them understand how art galleries function while also assisting students in entering shows. I was amazed at their individual transformations and from then on, changed my goal from being an artist featured in galleries to becoming a curator." says Zapata
   
 Her family often traveled and explored little towns. Upon finding and attending the Dia de Muertos festival they became connected to the community and decided to make Denison their home and open the gallery here.
   
 "Denison used to have many galleries and I am excited to add one to the community!" she says.
   
 Zapata wants the space to be where the community can come, create and express their creativity. She hopes to constantly be growing and hosting many community events.
   
 "I really have a passion for arts education and specifically in younger kids because I feel that a lot of times they can not find a space that supports their creativity and fosters growth. I was one of the lucky ones that were supported by friends and family at an early age and I would love to give back and be that for others," says Zapata
   
 After 3 years of hard work Zig Zag Galleries will have their Grand Opening on April 18th. To celebrate their opening they are hosting their very first exhibition Home, which is currently holding a call for artists. The reception will be from 5-7PM on opening day and work will be exhibited until May 20th.
   
 For more information on Zig Zag Galleries, located at 125 West Woodard Street in Denison, and the exhibition please visit www.zigzaggalleries.com. They can also be found on Facebook and Instagram under Zig Zag Galleries.

Cephus wasn't ranked among the top 20 receivers entering the combine and was seen as a fourth-round pick at best. He still would have been drafted in the late rounds because he was so impressive in pass-catching drills and during tests measuring strength, agility and explosiveness at the combine, but his bloated 40 time meant scouts would have had to look long and hard at the game film in order to go to bat for him in the draft room.
 As luck would have it, UW's pro day was early enough that it wasn't canceled by the coronavirus outbreak, which gave Cephus a second chance. To his credit, he capitalized on it.

Sydney and Stanley’s characters start off in a budding romance onscreen — the two both have sex for the first time with each other — but Stanley’s crush on Sydney is ultimately unrequited once Sydney realizes she actually has a crush on Dina.
 After Sydney comes to terms with her feelings for Dina, she tries to kiss her when the two are at a party, but the kiss isn’t reciprocated. Feeling rejected, Sydney storms out and leaves Dina to find her on-again, off-again boyfriend Brad Lewis (Richard Ellis), who’s a known jerk and also bullies Sydney.
 The two friends eventually get back on the same page when they’re all in detention at school and Sydney continues to grapple with her feelings for Dina and her newfound realization that she likes girls. It all comes to a head in the final episode of Season 1 when Sydney and Dina go to their school dance together as friends, and when they slow-dance together Dina tells Sydney she _did_ like the kiss they shared. But before they can further explore Dina’s admission, Brad interrupts the whole dance by embarrassing Sydney and reading her diary out loud.
 Brad’s bullying angers Sydney so much that her superpowers cause her to make his head literally explode off his body, leaving his blood and guts stained on everyone’s clothes and causing complete chaos in the high school gymnasium.
 Sofia Bryant said when she first read the script for _I Am Not Okay With This_ , she was intrigued by Dina and “understood her and her way of thinking immediately.” She was also drawn to the show because of the range of topics it addresses, including Sydney and Dina’s LGBTQ storyline.

 “Every Wednesday Thursday and Friday from 5-6 p.m., I’m doing livestreams of the store itself,” Wilson said. “I’m going to be flipping through inventory and if customers want to buy inventory, they can just comment on the livestream and I’ll ship it directly to their house or if they buy like $50 or more I’m even offering delivery too.
 “It’s sink or swim, and we’ve all been pretty good at swimming. Hopefully we’ll all get through.”
 It’s not yet known if the restrictions will only last two weeks. Wyman said the county could reduce or increase the time the restrictions are in place depending on how the pandemic progresses.
 “This is not an easy decision,” Wyman said. “I know a lot of people are going to be affected by this, but the flipside is doing nothing can have a catastrophic effect on our community. We need to take this seriously ... doing nothing is by far the greatest risk today.
 “There’s no perfect answer to this because these are unprecedented times. In my lifetime, we’ve never had to deal with something like this. We’re making the best decisions we can.”

“Ultimately, it’s OK to be exactly who you are and as soon as you can accept that and come to terms with all of that, you can be really happy.” (SPOILERS ahead!)

But you still can't just roll up and get tested -- hospitals and labs have established protocols that start with your primary care physician, who would then refer you to a testing center if you meet the criteria for symptoms. The latest CDC and health authority guidance directs clinicians to use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the respiratory disease that has sickened tens of thousands worldwide and killed nearly 10,000 in a span of a few months..

Other tricks might not be as conspicuous, but could go a long way toward boosting performance in your games. Variable Rate Shading can tweak the use of visual effects shaders to use them more or less depending on the game, while mesh shaders should allow for more detail in large game worlds. Sampler feedback, meanwhile, helps games load textures only when needed and boost performance as a result.
 Microsoft is adamant that compatibility shouldn't take a hit. A game written for DirectX 12 Ultimate will still run on other hardware -- you just won't get all the visual pizazz. Both AMD and NVIDIA are throwing their weight behind the framework.
 Ultimate should give game studios more incentives to try effects like ray tracing, not to mention a common tool for making Windows and Xbox Series X games -- write for one platform and it'll be easier to make it available elsewhere. It won't directly help outside of those platforms, but it might encourage your favorite developer to add more visual flair to their games.

The fate of the OHSAA's winter sports tournaments will be known within the next 24 to 48 hours, according to executive director Jerry Snodgrass.
 In a March 19 news conference from OHSAA headquarters in Columbus, Snodgrass said winter sports tournaments of boys basketball, girls basketball, wrestling and ice hockey remain "indefinitely suspended," but that cancelling is "certainly on the table" in light of restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 Snodgrass said the window for resuming the winter sports tournaments is "rapidly closing."

The suspension will take effect at the end of the day on March 23, the company said.

 Are we having fun yet?
 There's nothing like a pandemic to throw your world into perspective, huh?
 My daughter came home on Friday for spring break. Yay, right? We all know how much I miss her, so anytime she comes home, my spirits are high.
 Well, mid-week came the news that her break got extended a week. And, ominously, her college said they'd reassess and might have to go to online classes only. My first reaction was \"yesssssss!\" Freshman year would be cut short, and I'd have more time with my kid.
 But as the days have gone by, I realize I was being selfish. My poor daughter is legitimately bummed. If she can't go back to school, she also can't run her first season of college spring track. She never got a chance to say goodbye to friends. She's stuck hanging around with us, and not enjoying her semi- newfound independent life at school. Lo and behold, she's grown into quite a responsible, capable adult in just a few months!
 Don't get me wrong, I agree with the decision. I just want my family to be safe. One missed quarter of college is not going to make or break my kid. But it helped her when I started looking at the situation from her perspective.
 And now I'm prepping four newsrooms to work remotely for three weeks, which is a weird thing for journalists. While everyone else is hunkering down, we've got to be out reporting on this so that our readers have the most up-to-date information. Like with snowstorms and floods and all manner of natural disaster, my staff is right in the middle of it instead of safe at home. (That said, we are incredibly proud of our role and wouldn't change a thing!)
 Like with my daughter, a few weeks isn't going to break us. Heck, even if it extends a few months, we will be OK. There are positives, you just have to try a different perspective. My staff is going to become adept at working remotely. My family is going to get some extra time together, just us.
 And boy are we all going to have stories to tell 30 years from now.

The 90th Geauga County Maple Festival is not to be.

About the same time, we had begun the first stages of intimacy and it looked like things were going to go all the way. I don't know how to put this delicately but we were just about to get there when she stopped me. She said something I will never forget. 'I can't do this unless you understand that I belong to Keith. You have to share me with him'. That was the end. I put on my clothes and left. I have only seen her a couple of times since in passing but we never went out again. After that, I started asking questions and found out all about Raniere and Nxivm. That was maybe the weirdest experience of my life. I'm not 'scarred' or anything like that but I will never look at dating the same way again. She seemed really normal and somebody I could start a relationship with. So the revelation was a total shock.
