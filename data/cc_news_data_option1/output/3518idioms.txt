 That the first Monday in September is a statutory holiday in Canada has roots that go all the way back to 1872, when Toronto printers went on strike for decent working conditions.
 Nowadays Labour Day is celebrated more than anything else as a last-gasp holiday before the end of summer. But this holiday Monday, even without the customary parades, can't help but evoke more of its traditional role in calling attention to the need for better pay and conditions for the workers abandoned on the sidelines of economic progress. And not just because the coronavirus has cut into the possibilities for long-weekend fun.
 As the pandemic laid waste to our economy it ruthless exposed the deep inequalities in our communities and how badly frayed our social safety net has become. It revealed how much is wrong with the labour market and how completely outdated and inadequate are government regulations when it comes to doing anything about it.
 Millions of Canadians were plunged into unemployment as much of the economy were closed overnight to curtail the coronavirus. So few of them would have qualified for existing unemployment benefits that the federal government had to rush out new support programs to stave off an even bigger economic disaster.
 The crisis made it impossible to ignore how low-paid and precarious work has become for so many people. And it's made it clear that's not just a tragedy for them; it's a problem for us all.
 The use of poorly paid, part-time personal support workers and temp agency staff in long-term-care homes, for example, served to undermine the precautions that could have kept seniors in those homes safer and indeed alive. And on the front lines of essential services, from food production to grocery stores, too many people had no sickness benefits, making it difficult for them to stay home when ill, increasing the risks for everyone.
 Ontario actually had to recall the legislature to pass a law making it clear that workers can't be fired just for being sick or staying home to care for children at a time of crisis. That's how bad we've let things get.
 Already the crisis has forced some improvements. Last month, the Trudeau government announced an overhaul of Canada's antiquated Employment Insurance program, making it easier for people to qualify and increasing the payouts. It also launched three new programs, including an income benefit for the self- employed and contract workers and a COVID-19 caregiver benefit and sickness benefit.
 The benefits still need to be enacted by Parliament and, even then, they're meant to be temporary while the government drafts what the Liberals have promised will be a more equitable and inclusive post-pandemic economy.
 Canadians must hold Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to that promise and keep at bay those who push back against those who will prematurely call for cutting back on government spending. There's still so much work to do to build the better labour market that workers deserve and Canada needs.
 We need only look at how quickly businesses -- Loblaws, Metro, Sobeys and Walmart, to name a few -- clawed back the $2-per-hour pay premium for their "hero" front-line workers to know that.
 Or that food-delivery giant Foodora abruptly left Canada rather than face the possibility of a unionized workforce in a position to demand better pay and conditions.
 Or that Ontario Premier Doug Ford still doesn't believe in paid sick leave for everyone. Even after all we've learned about how the coronavirus spreads and how many people can't afford to stay home without pay, Ford still doesn't get it.
 If the mantra of "build back better" means anything, we must revalue low-paid but essential work and tackle the scourge of precarious work, gig economy jobs and temp agencies that leave workers scrambling just to earn minimum wage. We need to legislate paid sick days for all workers (and not just for those directly affected by COVID-19) and dramatically expand affordable childcare so that women aren't held back.
 It's long past time that our labour laws recognized the current realities of what work is actually like for people on the lower rungs of the economy and the lengths that some businesses will go to undercut worker compensation and protections.
 The pandemic has shown how essential much low-paid, undervalued work really is, and revealed that people are working in conditions society should no longer tolerate. Having accepted that better job protections and income supports are necessary in a crisis, we can't go back to pretending they're not needed all the time.
 Fixing the labour market and ensuring more workers have a chance at a decent job isn't just the right thing to do. It's vital to making Canada more resilient to future upheavals, whether that be another wave of COVID-19 or some other new disaster we haven't yet imagined.
 This Labour Day is a time to reflect on lessons learned the hard way through the pandemic and redouble efforts to create a better future for all workers.

Apache County has an estimated population of 70,174 people living in 20,395 households and another 1,348 people living in group quarters for a total population of 71,422.
 In 2010, estimates suggest about 1.6% of the national population never got counted – perhaps as many as 16 million people. Homeowners were overcounted, renters undercounted. Native Americans were undercounted, whites were overcounted. Native Americans living on reservations were undercounted by 5%.
 The pandemic undoubtedly plays a role in the dramatic undercount locally. Apache and Navajo Counties were coping with one of the worst per-capita outbreaks in the country during the Census Bureau’s early push to convince people to fill out online forms — or request a form through the mail. Both counties already face a challenge in getting an accurate count, giving the distances involved, the lack of internet in many households and even the lack of regular street addresses, especially on the vast stretches of the reservations. The undercount has gotten progressively worse in the last three Census cycles.
 A tight deadline this year will complicate the effort to contact the people who haven’t yet sent in their surveys — leaving less time to contact far more people.
 The Trump Administration abruptly ordered the Census Bureau to wrap up the count four weeks early. Four former Census Bureau directors warned the early deadline could result in an inaccurate count and urged Congress to assess the quality of the count to date and to provide more time if necessary.
 The Census Bureau has vowed to meet the new goal, but has been having trouble even hiring enough census takers, partly as a result of concerns about the risk of getting COVID-19 going door to door.
 The administration argues the Census Bureau needs the extra time to process the numbers before the normal Dec. 31 deadline. The House had earlier voted to extend the deadline to April 2021, but the Senate declined to follow suit.
 Democrats and Republicans have been locked in a dispute about whether to no longer include undocumented residents in the count. The Trump Administration had added a question to the census form to find out if someone was in the country illegally — but opponents filed a lawsuit saying the question would discourage many people from filling out a form at all. A judge threw out the question. However, the issue re-emerged in an effort to make changes to avoid counting people here illegally anyway.
 Republicans argue this will avoid giving states money to provide federally funded services to illegal immigrants. Democrats argue the nation needs a complete population count. Excluding undocumented workers from the count will have a pronounced impact on states with large numbers of immigrants, including Arizona, Texas and others.
 With less than a month left and an estimated 60 million people uncounted nationally, local officials and Census Bureau are beginning to panic.
 “When door-knocking follow up began on Aug. 9 to count non-responding households in-person, Navajo County’s self-response rate was 11 points behind its 2010 rate,” the Census Bureau explained on its website. “That means a greater share of non-responding homes will need to be visited by census takers — an especially challenging task now that the Census Bureau has shortened the door-knocking timeframe by four weeks. Higher self-response rates mean fewer people are likely to be missed or counted inaccurately and fewer households will have a visit from a census taker to be counted in-person.”
 Layton said the undercount will affect Apache and Navajo Counties for a decade if residents don’t rally.
 “If we want more job opportunities in our region, we need every resident counted because businesses use census data to decide where to build factories, offices and stores,” he said.

HOLBROOK — Navajo County Sheriff’s Office investigators are looking into the death of a 19-year-old man found with a gunshot wound.
 A press release from NCSO Public Information Officer Tori Gorman stated that Ryan Begay, 19, of Winslow, was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound that happened near Territorial Road outside Winslow on Saturday, Aug. 29.
 Begay was out shooting firearms in the area of Territorial Road, east of State Route 99, according to investigators and was leaning on the back of an open trunk. His friend, Angel Romero, 20, of Winslow, allegedly discharged a firearm he believed to be unloaded.
 Friends at the scene quickly loaded Begay into a vehicle and applied pressure to the wound. The friends transported Begay to Little Colorado Medical Center for advanced medical treatment of his injuries but he suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead by the emergency medical providers. The involved parties contacted the hospital and immediately reported to law enforcement.
 Deputies and detectives responded and initiated a criminal investigation into the shooting death of Begay. All parties that were present provided statements and evidence was collected.
 The criminal investigation is presently pending but upon completion, will be submitted to the Navajo County Attorney’s Office for review and consideration of potential criminal charges.
 Sheriff Clouse and the entire staff would like to extend their sincerest condolences to the family of Ryan Begay.
 An autopsy has been ordered to determine the exact cause of death.

Continued delays “could be the end of our facility” said Worsley. “We need a new chipper – but I can’t make a $300,000 commitment” without long-term contracts. We’re in this weird conundrum of operating as well as we’ve ever operated and burning as much wood as we’ve ever burned. But our warnings are going unheard. Any type of hiccup and we’d be in a lot of trouble.”
 Alan Reidhead, who operates a small-wood mill that dovetails with NovoPower, said, “I’d like to echo Brad’s sentiment. Any type of industry thrives on consistency and predictability. We have deadlines. When we tell our investors this is going to happen and it doesn’t, it changes the outcome. The likelihood the number is going to get pushed past March is high. It’s been a year and three months since the RFP is supposed to have been completed. It keeps getting pushed and pushed. You can’t keep doing that. All efforts need to be made to move forward and get things settled, one way or the other.”
 Kruger declined to detail why the contract award has been postponed
 “The Forest Service is working very diligently on the evaluations and anticipate an award during the first half of Fiscal Year 2021 (October 2020-March 2021),” he said. “The date of the anticipated selection depends on the negotiations with offerors and is highly fluid. Based on the complexity, scale and duration of the 20-year contract, the Forest Service anticipates that the remaining stages of the evaluation process will require significant time to complete even with a dedicated team with various expertise being fully staffed and focused on the evaluation phase.”
 The Forest Service hopes to avoid the nearly decade of false starts that have so far hobbled the first round of contracts awarded, some 300,000 acres centered on the Flagstaff area. The Forest Service awarded a 10-year contract, which has so far been shifted to four different contractors — none of whom has actually thinned more than a fraction of the 50,000 acres-per-year originally planned. The biomass has remained the economic chokepoint. The original contractor promised to turn the biomass into jet fuel, but never built a facility to do that.
 A decade ago, the Forest Service did thin some 50,000 acres in White Mountains, but that depended on a $500 to $800 per-acre taxpayer subsidy to dispose of the biomass. The White Mountains Stewardship Project kept a straggle of wood processing operations in business and likely saved Alpine and possibly Springerville from the Wallow Fire.
 The Forest Service has spent millions developing an innovative way to do the required environmental assessment on a million acres of forest up front, clearing the way for the return of an economically viable forest products industry. But the effort to provide stable, long-term supply of wood and a way to profitably process the biomass has left 4FRI in limbo and every forested community in grave dangers, as the size, intensity and frequency of mega-fires has exploded.
 New Life Forest Products has opened a new sawmill in Williams as well as an operation in Heber, which has been processing wood from the original 4FRI contracts. FEC Logging USA Holdings owns both NewLife and Good Earth Power, which has a contract to thin 300,000 acres.
 “Both our sawmills are currently operating,” said a New Life representative at the stakeholders meeting. “We’re seeing significant improvements in production. Lumber prices right now are at an all-time high and the market is screaming for fiber. Prices have basically doubled since April. We’re trying to take advantage of this upswing, because they were down for quite some time.”
 But the survival of the industry may depend on the next round of contracts, said Reidhead. “It’s a huge contract that’s going to sway things in so many directions. We have a good chance of losing all the work we’ve done.”

The Forest Service will postpone until at least next March the contracts to thin up to 818,000 acres of forest in Rim Country and the White Mountains, forest restoration advocates learned last week at the stakeholders meeting for the 4Forests Restoration Initiative.
 The Forest Service has already postponed the contract award for more than a year. The Forest Service issued the additional six-month delay without announcing it in a press release.
 Jeremy Kruger, the recently installed chief executive for 4FRI, responded to _the Independent’s_ request for an explanation by saying “the solicitation is important and complex; it is a project of unprecedented scale and the longest 20-year stewardship contract that the agency has undertaken. We are balancing the need for space to work with offerors and our team of experts through all stages of evaluation with the efficiency, urgency and timeliness of award. We want to be diligent, thorough and have the opportunity to work with the offerors. This process cannot be rushed if we want to be successful for the next 20 years.”
 However, the continued delay threatens the survival of the mills and biomass burning plant essential to the contract. The effort to launch large-scale thinning has been stymied for nearly a decade by a lack of small-wood sawmills and a way to profitably process the biomass that constitutes half of the material in need of removal. Tree densities have increased from about 50 per acre to more like 800 per acre in the past century due to grazing, logging and fire suppression — dramatically increasing the damage done by wildfires.
 A handful of mills and biomass plants that have been holding on for years are running out of time, said Brad Worsley, head of NovoPower — the only biomass burning power plant in the state.
 “I don’t know how to yell and scream about this any louder,” said Worsley during a recent Zoom-conferenced meeting of the 4FRI stakeholders group. The stakeholder group includes loggers, environmentalists, forestry experts and local officials who support large scale thinning to reduce the risk of the kinds of mega-fires that destroyed the town of Paradise, California, killing 85 people.
 Worsley said the biomass burning near Snowflake is operating at peak efficiency and capacity, but can’t stay in business without long-term contracts, which depend on the outcome of the again delayed 4FRI contracts as well as action by the Corporation Commission.
 Hope had glimmered last year when the Arizona Corporation Commission agreed to consider requiring power companies to generate at least 90 megawatts of power annually from burning biomass, enough to support more than 50,000 acres of forest restoration annually. The commission narrowly rejected the mandate. Voters will select three commissioners in November, which could renew hopes for the biomass mandate — although only incumbent Lea Marquez Patterson has clearly supported issuing the mandate.

Interventional cardiology. You may not be familiar with those two words, but if you or a loved one ever come to Northern Westchester Hospital in the midst of a heart attack, you will hear them and know that you’re getting the best of specialized care in the hospital’s new cardiac catheterization lab—part of the Seema Boesky Heart Center, which opened September 2.
 According to the American Medical Association, interventional cardiology is a “subspecialty of cardiology that deals specifically with the catheter-based treatment of heart diseases.” Since the 1980s this subspecialty has saved countless lives and helped many others avoid open heart surgery.
 “A cath lab, as it’s called,” said Dr. Carl Dietrich Reimers, Medical Director of the Cardiac Catheterization Lab, “is a procedural room in a hospital where cardiac specialists diagnose and treat coronary artery disease, such as various types of heart attack, using tiny flexible tubes called catheters to access the heart and coronary (heart) blood vessels.”
 With the opening of the lab, residents in surrounding areas will no longer be sent to other hospitals if they’re experiencing a cardiac emergency—the cath lab team now boasts the advanced care to treat these emergencies. And that can make a significant difference, since restoring blood flow in arteries within 90 minutes results in the best outcomes, according to Dr. Reimers.
 Dr. Reimers is one of the four interventional cardiologists at the lab. Dr. A. Garvey Rene serves as the Associate Director and Dr. Umar S. Rashid and Dr. Craig Basman round out the quartet. Each has up to 13 years of medical education and training. The skill level of the cath lab nurses are second to none. All cardiac cath nurses are critical-care-trained, and the angiographic technicians receive specialized training that takes standard radiology expertise to the next level.
 “Our team has an exceptional opportunity to enhance the healthcare in the surrounding communities and provide specialized treatment that did not exist before,” said Dr. Basman about the new lab.
 The team has nothing but excitement for the brand-new, state-of-the-art cardiac catheterization lab at Northern Westchester Hospital.
 “For me, it’s amazing,” said Dr. Rene. “A patient comes in with a heart attack and on the verge of dying. They walk out of the hospital in two to three days.”
 “You get to see a patient in acute distress, often at death’s door, and within minutes, you’re able to stop what’s happening with them,” added Dr. Rashid. “You actually see results right there in the room. I can’t imagine anything that compares to that. Every day, it amazes me. It’s what you go into medicine for.”
 Dr. Reimers speaks for all four when he says he loves being a doctor: “The patient comes in with a heart attack and you save their life. At the end of the day, when my time is up, I’ll know I did something real—I helped. I couldn’t imagine not being a doctor.”

But there's no question the economic impact for arts groups of what could now be two seasons of lost ticket revenue has been brutal, and nowhere more than at CAPA, where 90 percent of the budget is revenue earned through ticket sales, rentals and concessions at Columbus' four biggest theaters, plus several other venues. CAPA laid off all of its part-time staff as soon as the theaters closed, and 40 percent of the full-time staff were laid off during the summer.

HOLBROOK — A Navajo County Sheriff’s Office Criminal Interdiction Deputy arrested Johanna Romo Delgado, 41, of Superior on Monday.
 Deputies conducted a traffic stop on U.S. Highway 60 at mile post 338, near Show Low, for traffic infractions on Monday. During the stop, the deputy walked K-9 Deputy Zolton around the vehicle to perform a free air sniff and the dog quickly alerted on the vehicle. Upon further investigation and search of the vehicle, approximately 4.5 pounds of M30 Fentanyl pills (approximately 20,000 pills) were located inside of a bag. The estimated street value is $600,000.
 Those pills were believed to be headed straight for the streets of Show Low.
 Delgado was booked into the Navajo County Jail for transportation of narcotic drugs for sale, possession of narcotic drugs for sale and possession of narcotic drugs. She is currently being held on a $600,000 bond.
 Fentanyl is a powerful pain medication. It is an opioid, like Morphine, Codeine, Oxycodone and Methadone. Fentanyl is up to 100 times stronger than Morphine and is extremely dangerous when not used in a prescribed manner and under the direction of a medical doctor. Because Fentanyl is so strong, the difference between a dose that will get a person high and a dose that will cause death is very small.
 “The White Mountains are seeing an increase of this very dangerous drug entering our communities. The Navajo County Sheriff’s Office Criminal Interdiction Unit and Major Crimes Apprehension Team (MCAT) Drug Task Force are working around the clock to prevent these drugs from coming in and to apprehend those bringing it and selling it,” said Navajo County Sheriff David Clouse.

Illinois’ constitution currently mandates a flat-rate income tax, which now carries a personal rate of 4.95%. Pritzker and Democrats put on the ballot the proposed change in the state constitution, which would allow for a graduated- rate tax structure that increases along with income, similar to the federal income tax.
 A law adopted if voters ratify the proposed constitutional amendment would increase taxes on those making more than $250,000, meaning 97% of taxpayers would pay no more or less than they do now, supporters say.

NEED TO KNOW: It's a tough turnaround to go from a down-to-the-wire Game 7 to a Game 1 of a new series in less than 48 hours, and the Nuggets seemed a bit out of sorts on the defensive end in the opener. Nuggets coach Michael Malone made it sound like many problems were correctable, and he's right. But Denver needs its offensive swagger back too; Dallas showed in Round 1 that it is possible to score in bunches on the Clippers.

Like hip-hop? Pop music? Latin sounds? Western Swing? Whatever your flavor, HAAM Day 2020 has you covered. On Thursday, the Health Alliance for Austin Musicians dropped a diverse lineup stacked with top tier Austin talent for their first ever virtual event.
   
 Under ordinary circumstances, the largest annual fundraiser for the non-profit organization that provides low-cost healthcare to Austin's musicians is an all-day, city-wide celebration with performances at favorite venues and unexpected pop-ups at banks, fast food joints and dentist's offices. Due to the coronavirus, they've gone remote with performances broadcast live on HAAM's Facebook page, Austin's Fox 7 and Luck.Stream, the live streaming operation from the "bootstrapping organization based in Willie Nelson's backyard of Luck, Texas" that hosts the popular Luck Reunion.
   
 The first performance at 9 a.m. is a raucous wake up call with Blackillac, Mobley, Reckless Kelly, Ms. Lavelle White, Scrappy Jud Newcomb and more.
   
 At 2 p.m., Tomar and the FCs bring the soul, Marcia Ball packs the blues and Trail of Dead plays tunes from their incongruously catchy new album, "X: The Godless Void and Other Stories." The performance also includes sets from Eimaral Sol, Como Las Movies and more.
   
 For an online-only 4 p.m. set, Brazilian powerhouse Federico 7 meets country crooners Croy and the Boys and Austin royalty, Doyle Bramhall II in a performance that also includes appearances from supergroup Glorietta and Latin pop breakout Gina Chavez.
   
 And to close out the night, Austin's kings of swing, Asleep at the Wheel kick off a bananas lineup featuring Jackie Venson, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Grupo Fantasma, Shinyribs, Alesia Lani, Riders Against the Storm and many more.
   
 The nonprofit, that turns 15 this year, is aiming to raise $600,000. This year's HAAM Day event is sponsored by South by Southwest Festival and Conference and Austin City Limits Music Festival. In addition to the four concerts HAAM hosts, individual artists will be playing sets on their own pages to support HAAM.

Illinois now has a constitutionally mandated flat-rate tax that taxes all personal income at the same rate of 4.95%.
 Under a graduated-rate income tax, different levels of wages are taxed at different rates. Proponents say higher income taxpayers should bear a greater tax burden than lower income taxpayers. Opponents say a graduated tax hurts business owners and job creators and makes them the target of future tax hikes. Raising taxes across the board under a flat tax is more difficult to do, they say.
 How does a graduated rate tax work?
 When a state imposes a graduated income tax, it separates the pay scale into a number of fixed income brackets and determines a different tax rate for each bracket, called a marginal rate.
 These brackets apply to every individual taxpayer’s income — the first bracket of your income will be taxed at the lowest rate, the second bracket at the second lowest rate, and so on. Ultimately, one’s average tax rate will be lower than their final marginal rate.
