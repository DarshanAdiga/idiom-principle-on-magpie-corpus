Available in SE, SEL, SEL Plus and Limited trims, the front-drive Sonata, under its hey-look-at-me wardrobe, can be fitted with one of two engines, both managed by an eight-speed automatic. SE and SEL are motivated by a 2.5-liter, 191-hp I-4, which is good for 181 lb.-ft. of torque. SEL Plus and Limited are powered by a 1.6-liter, turbo four that, at 180 ponies, corrals fewer horses but, thanks to the blower’s artificial aspiration, ups the torque count to 195 lb.-ft., grunt fully on board at a low 1,500 rpm.
 We drove a Limited, which over 130 miles of mixed city/hwy motoring returned to us 32 mpg, one better than the EPA predicted.
 On the road, Sonata turbo is a pleasant companion. No hot rod, to be sure -- it takes nearly eight seconds to greet 60 mph -- but quite competent, appropriately quiet and always civil.

As a constituent of Rep. Pete Oberacker, I was concerned to hear him suggest at the May 6 County Board meeting that Otsego County should take a “go it alone” approach to reopening businesses, rather than rely on data and experts to determine how to safely get back to normal.                                    During the meeting, Mr. Oberacker — who is running to represent us in the State Senate — said “it is up to us to speed this along and to move it along … we in Otsego County feel we know better in Otsego County the path to get us back to opening … and start this flow of sales tax coming back in.” More than 20,000 New Yorkers have lost their lives to COVID-19. Upstate has been largely spared due to the early warning from downstate. Let’s not kid ourselves. Our limited health care systems can be overrun if we’re not smart. Does Mr. Oberacker prioritize bringing in county tax dollars over the health and safety of our residents?                                    Later in the meeting, Mr. Oberacker was the County Board’s sole vote against following the state’s expert guidance on safely re-opening. I can only assume this rejection of science-based criteria was an attempt to appeal to folks who are justifiably frustrated by the impacts of New York Pause on their lives. Good politics? Maybe, but not good leadership.                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times

“This is like when we opened this business 26 years ago,” Beetle said. “It’s the same excitement and the same stress.”
 Some restaurants have rented large tents so diners can eat under cover. Others are using tables with umbrellas. Some are taking advantage of patios or decks they had built previously for diners who preferred to sit outside. Others had to create the space.
 Because of continued health concerns over the coronavirus regulations that the restaurants must follow – include requiring staff to wear masks all the time, and patrons to wear them when going to or from their tables – tables will be limited to parties of six, and must be placed 6 feet apart. Conversation between parties at different tables will not be allowed.
 Because patrons will be required to observe social distancing at all times — even while waiting for a table — restaurants are encouraging people to make reservations, or at the very least call ahead to find out when a table might be available.
 Beetle called the regulations reasonable.
 “They are a good step to getting us back open,” he said, adding that members of the restaurant’s staff will be enforcing those regulations.
 "State and local officials were great to work with on this," he said.
 Chris McDonough, who with his brother owns Fratello’s in Laconia and the Homestead restaurant in Bristol, sees outside-dining-only at a good sign, but hopes it is short-lived.
 “We’re anxious to get indoor seating as soon as possible. It’s tough to see a restaurant sitting empty,” he said.
 In the meantime, McDonough said that he is planning on two sittings per table at Fratello’s. The restaurant will have room for about 50 diners on an open deck on the restaurant’s second floor, plus tables set up in one area of the parking lot.
 Local officials have been working with restaurants that need permits for those who are putting up tents.
 Belmont Planning Director Dari Sassan said the town has tried to strike a balance between protecting public health during the pandemic and helping eating establishments “reopen to some level of business.”
 He said his office, along with the town’s code enforcement officer and fire chief, have worked to expedite the process of issing necessary approvals.
 Two places have obtained permission to put up tents for outside dining — J.J. Yolk, a breakfast and lunch place, and the Tap Public House, a sports bar which shares space with Brookside Pizza.
 Laconia Planner Dean Trefethen said four places obtained tent permits — 405 Pub, Brickfront, Water Street Cafe, and T-Bones. He said one big reason tents require permits is because they need to be inspected for fire safety. He said in the instances of these four set-ups, inspectors also had to check to make sure that the tables met the 6-foot separation requirement.
 Downtown restaurateur Reuben Bassett said his Local Eatery and Burrito Me have outdoor patios that will be utilized.
 Burrito Me does a thriving takeout business, but Local Eatery is a sit-down restaurant and has a greater potential for benefiting from outdoor seating.
 "We have a patio and are expanding that. We can have seating in front and in back of the restaurant. It's weather dependent, but we have a capacity for as much outdoor seating as indoor."
 The demand for outdoor dining space has meant a surge in business for companies that rent and set up tents.

Ready today. Planning for tomorrow.
 That’s the theme of this year’s National Emergency Medical Services (EMS) week, May 17-23. It couldn’t be more appropriate in describing Maryland’s EMS clinicians who have been an important part of the front-line force to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.
 This year in Maryland the EMS system will respond to more than one million calls for help. Emergency medical dispatchers, emergency medical responders, EMTs, cardiac rescue technicians, and paramedics will meet their neighbors, fellow citizens, and visitors during some of their worse moments. In many cases they will provide life-saving care with efficient expertise. Sometimes they will merely offer an empathetic helping hand. At any time they are ready to go places most of us would not choose and to help people they do not know. Often, as during the current pandemic, they risk their own health.
 Throughout our magnificent state, people know that expert help is a mere phone call away. At any hour of day or night, literally thousands of people are standing at the ready to respond to emergencies of all types. They are career personnel and committed volunteers. They undergo hundreds of hours of specialized and continuing education to ensure they possess the needed knowledge and skills to prepare for most any foreseeable situation. Planning never ends. They are in our urban centers and rural corners, and they do their work with little fanfare.
 Typically, National EMS Week provides an opportunity for our hospitals and others to honor our EMS workers. Every year we gather to remember those EMS professionals, career personnel and volunteers, who lost their lives in the line of duty. Most of these events are not possible this year, as we continue to exercise caution amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it’s up to each of us to acknowledge the incredible work and dedication of the men and women of our EMS system. Give a wave. Just say, “Thanks!”
 We can all do something else. Plan to learn CPR. A critical link in the chain of survival, CPR saves lives. Learn to stop the bleed. Simple, easy to learn techniques can control life-threatening bleeding. These efforts will amplify the life-saving success of the EMS system. The life we save might be a loved one. I hope every Marylander will help to make National EMS Week mean something here at home.
 There is no doubt that Maryland’s EMS system, and its thousands of committed men and women, are Ready Today. They are continually Planning for Tomorrow. Marylanders should be proud!

With Frances's sunny personality, she was a shoe in for the "Sunshine" position and enjoyed keeping up with sending cards to members to acknowledge special occasions. Frances was a gifted gardener, and her house was always in "Good Housekeeping" order. She was always completely devoted to her family. Frances was preceded in death by her parents, and recently her beloved husband of 73 years, Jack Lloyd. Their two children survive, David (Gloria) Lloyd and Beth Imars, both of Medina, Ohio.

Out of adversity often comes innovation.  
 As fire departments continue to battle coronavirus, Cuyahoga Falls firefighters are channeling their inner MacGyver and building devices to do extra decontamination.  
 "This is an unseen enemy," Falls Fire Lt. Rick Malak said. "You have to be hyper vigilant about everything."  
 Assistant Chief Chris Martin said the department started ordering masks, gowns, gloves and other necessary protective gear to stockpile in preparation for coronavirus. It also started adding extra cleaning and decontamination to its arsenal.  
 Like protective equipment, medical cleaning equipment was on back order. As they waited for items to become available, firefighters started seeing what they could make on their own.  
 "Most of the guys in the fire department have some mechanical intuition, " Lt. Tom Carano said. "We all like to tinker."  
 Tinker away they did, and now the department has a wide array of UV-light based units, both bought and built, to decontaminate rooms and items.  
 Carano said they're using the UV lights in addition to their normal decontamination protocols. UV light is not clinically proven to kill coronavirus yet but has been shown to kill most other viruses. Similar devices are used in hospitals to sanitize rooms, and smaller devices are available commercially to clean smaller objects, although they have been hard to buy recently.  
 "In light of the virus, every little thing we can do extra makes our city that much safer," he said.  
 The science behind UV light, Carano said, is that it stops cellular replication, killing viruses and bacteria with prolonged exposure. UV-light is what gives people sunburns, but a lot more of it is needed for decontamination, so the department uses special light bulbs.  
 To clean the backs of ambulances and rooms in the fire station, Carano wired a timer into five floor lamps, and outfitted them with UV-light bulbs. The lamps are left to run for about half an hour and can cover up to 500 square feet of space.  
 The same bulbs can go into the decontamination boxes Carano made to use for smaller items, including firefighters' masks, tablets they use on the job or even their cell phones. The rubber containers, lined with reflective material, have hooks on their lids so masks can be dangled in front of the light and hit on all sides.  
 The department bought small containers that look almost like lunch boxes that do the same thing.  
 Carano said they also bought a lamp designed for decontamination. The medical lamp cost about $1,000, and it broke the next day. Carano made five lamps for about half the cost.  
 Using UV light also avoids having to use chemicals. N95-masks, for instance, can be damaged if they're cleaned with some chemicals. Carano said the masks use a static charge, which attracts particles like a magnet. Using a chemical solution could remove that charge.  
 Every patient gets a new mask they keep. The N-95 masks firefighters use are in high-demand, and the UV light can give them a way to clean them in between calls, Carano said.  
 "Right now, they're in short supply, so we're doing everything we can to make them last longer." Carano said.  
 Staying clean isn't just important for patients, it's also important for paramedics themselves. Malak said in many cases, they're face-to-face with people who may have or are confirmed to have coronavirus when they respond in an ambulance.  
 "We have to sit within a couple of feet of the patient for the entire trip," Malak said.  
 To help mitigate risk, Malak built onto the existing exhaust systems in each ambulance and created a way to expel air from patients out the door, instead of toward paramedics. Using plumbing parts and shop-vac tubes, he said it's a cheap way to keep the firefighters safe and healthy.  
 "In effect, they're not exhaling in the back of the ambulance," Malak said.  
 For added decontamination, the department also purchased a "disinfectant bomb" that will fog the back of the ambulances with a cleaning solution. The bomb is used every few weeks in addition to germ-killing wipes used after each call.  
 Martin said the increased decontamination, both purchased and made in-house, has been an ongoing effort as the department stays prepared for the coronavirus. Some of the items, like the disinfectant bomb, will be used for years to come, and the next ambulance coming to the department already has UV lights built in.  
 Staying ahead of the virus hasn't come cheap. Fire Chief Fred Jackson said the department has spent tens of thousands of dollars more than it normally would.  
 The need for more protective equipment and rising prices for the items have contributed to the increased spending, he said.  
 When Ebola hit the country, Jackson said the department learned to be prepared. It has some supplies stockpiled from then, and will stockpile any back-ordered supplies they order now but get later.  
 At their current rate of use, Martin said they'll have enough personal protective equipment for the current wave of coronavirus cases. As the supplies they ordered come in, they can stock up and prepare for potential second or third waves. He said the only true marker that the crisis is over is when the vaccine is available..  
 "We've gotten through the sprint, now we're in the marathon," Martin said. "We still need to be as far ahead of this as we can."

In the late 1970s, NBC launched a notoriously expensive dud titled "Supertrain," so students of TV history likely saw this as a derailment waiting to happen.
 Based on a French graphic novel, the series is all about class inequality, with the train providing a heavy-handed way of exploring the social pecking order. Seven years into this sobering reality, the poor live in cramped, horrible conditions in the train's tail, with ascending levels of privilege and luxury as you travel up the cars to first class.
 As if building that rolling world weren't enough, "Snowpiercer" sets its plot in motion with the oldest of devices -- namely, a murder mystery. Specifically, someone has been gruesomely killed in one of the front cars, prompting the train's officious bureaucrat, Melanie Cavill (Jennifer Connelly), to recruit Andre Layton ("Hamilton's" Daveed Diggs), a one-time detective living in the tail, to come forward to solve the case.

Pocono Raceway is selling tickets for its NASCAR Doubleheader week in late June. But will Pennsylvania be ready to host the event?
 Asked about it during Friday’s daily coronavirus briefing, Gov. Tom Wolf said it’s impossible to make a decision yet, throwing doubt on the four-day NASCAR event.
 The Tricky Triangle is in Monroe County, which as of Friday remains in the red phase of Pennsylvania’s coronavirus shutdown – where the strictest social distancing has been imposed. Nonessential businesses are closed, and gatherings of more than 10 people prohibited.
 Forty-nine counties are in or will soon move to the yellow phase, the second level of the three-tiered reopening plan, including neighboring Carbon County. Monroe could soon be in that group as its rate of new coronavirus cases is near what has been deemed acceptable for starting the process.

Gramophones, tape recorders and portable record players were not spared. Mr Ho studied them all. He bought weekly and monthly subscriptions for technical manuals and magazines on these electronics, flipping through them for hours each day.

 Mr Ho stuck to this practice as he worked for three different agents for about 30 years, becoming increasingly skilled with his hands.
 When he realised he could only fix TVs for the few hours each day when programmes were being broadcast, he decided he had to take matters into his own hands.

Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman, county health officer, did not return an immediate request for comment.
 The decision comes as city and county businesses evaluate plans to reopen following Gov. Larry Hogan’s Wednesday announcement that retail stores, hair salons, barbershops and manufacturing businesses were given permission to open to fewer patrons starting at 5 p.m. Friday.
 Pittman took a more limited approach to ease certain restrictions approved by Hogan based on health data demonstrating the county isn’t ready to open more broadly. Retail stores are allowed to reopen but only for curbside pickup. Hair salons and barbershops can only have one customer at a time.
 “Retail is an experience that takes place in businesses. That is an unrealistic stipulation that retail can do curbside. It’s a misguided resolution,” said Zia Boccaccio, owner of Alpaca International on Main Street.
 Boccaccio joined 100 other business owners on a Zoom call Friday with the mayor, the city’s small business recovery task force and other business leaders to discuss what reopening parts of the city’s economy would look like. Buckley encouraged store owners to place clothing racks and tables outside their stores to attract customers walking around town.
 Although Buckley and other business owners were hopeful about the city’s ability to slowly reopen, the mayor emphasized that social distancing and other safety precautions must be followed to prevent another spike in coronavirus cases and avoid another economic shutdown.
 “We know we have to get back to business and we have to get our economy moving once again. But make no mistake, if we move too fast, people will die,” Buckley said.
 The economic shutdown in the wake of coronavirus has devastated all facets of the economy. Boccaccio, a small business owner, has been steadily growing her boutique Alpaca wool clothing line for 17 years. She finally gained a foothold in the market and had recently expanded her brand to locations in Utah and Alaska and shops on cruise lines. Then coronavirus swept the country.
 “From one day to the other, it’s like everything has been erased,” Boccaccio said. “It’s hard but I’m hopeful. We’re going to work like hell to survive.”
 Many business owners permitted to reopen Friday say they were caught off guard by Hogan’s announcement. Some stores took the shutdown as an opportunity to remodel, others need more time to buy protective supplies. And for some, the restrictions won’t generate enough revenue to balance the overhead costs of reopening.
 “After the announcement, the phone went crazy,” said Luc Fouquet, owner of Hudson Fouquet Salon.
 Even though the demand for hair services is intense, the one-customer restriction makes reopening unfeasible for Fouquet, who employs 30 stylists at his two salons in Annapolis and Edgewater.

Leadership campaigns typically involve traveling the country to meet as many members as possible. Some of these stops are large events with hundreds in attendance; but candidates also trek far and away to secure the votes of just a couple of members at a local coffee shop.
 It is democracy in action. Now, there are no in-person gatherings.
 Rather, the candidates have been working the phones, having Zoom chats, and posting videos online to share their vision of the party and of Canada.
 That's not all though. It's not just the logistics that have changed. Politics as we know it has shifted as well.
 When these candidates first tossed their hat in the ring, they would have had pre-set notions of the policies they wanted to promote.
 They have no doubt thrown a lot of that out the window. The facts have changed.
 Whether it's the gargantuan deficits Canada now faces, the serious health care challenges, or the increasingly troubled relationship with China -- the issues have changed and require new solutions.
 It remains to be seen whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will in turn adjust his policies and priorities to whatever the new normal of Canadian politics becomes.
 Whoever wins the next Conservative leadership race will certainly need to do this though.
 Canadians will be asking for a lot of their politicians in the months and years to come. The pandemic has introduced new challenges to our lives and further exposed old ones.
 The candidates for CPC leader have their work cut out for them.

Pedestrians, on the other hand, have to dodge the vehicles traveling the narrow dead-end lane leading to it. The shabby route has never matched the stunning view it parallels. That's in part because the road hearkens to an earlier era when the bayfront was more about industry than leisure.
   
 Now, as reporter Kevin Flowers detailed, East Dobbins Landing is getting both the safeguards and fresh amenities businesses like Sedney's need to finesse this space, one of emerging Erie's most important assets.
   
 Crews have started work on a new $2.65 million dock wall along the bay stretching from State Street to Rum Runners. A 730-foot wall, about 1 foot higher than the existing wall, will be installed, as will a sidewalk, benches and new plantings. It is the first of several dock wall repair projects totaling an estimated $20 million-plus planned by the Erie-Western Pennsylvania Port Authority over the next several years.
   
 Erie Refocused consultant Charles Buki rightly called Erie's bayfront one of its most squandered assets. This improved dock wall, as Flowers noted, will help make that still mostly undeveloped area of Dobbins Landing more attractive to investors.
   
 It is also rightly timed to safeguard a prime Erie asset potentially at risk. For decades, investments have been made to transform the bayfront from a gritty, toxic industrial eyesore into a gleaming new district that features the Erie County Public Library, the Erie Maritime Museum, a growing list of swanky hotels and the Bayfront Convention Center, with tall glass walls that frame sweeping views of Presque Isle Bay. More ambitious development is hoped for.
   
 Waterfront development by its nature always requires careful planning. Extreme weather fueled by climate change in recent years has raised new awareness of the vigilance that must be exercised when creating and safeguarding shoreline attractions.
   
 Experts have warned that the changing climate could deliver high waters, as we have seen in recent years, and precipitous drops in lake levels.
   
 The new East Dobbins Landing dock wall and improvements to be made at other prime waterfront spots, including Liberty Park, are prudent investments that defend both valuable property and Erie's hopes.

The compensation board is made up of nine individuals, whom are appointed by the governor, president pro tempore of the Senate, and speaker of the House. The governor picks five board members, who must be from religious organizations, communications media, non-state supported educational institutions, labor organizations, and retail businesses. The pro tempore appoints two members from agricultural and civic organizations, while the speaker taps two members from manufacturing and professional fields not otherwise specified.
 Because the compensation board and its objective are written into the Oklahoma constitution, legal experts and lawmakers have said there's nothing to be done, and that running a bill to rescind the raises might even be unconstitutional.
 State Rep. Chris Sneed, R-Fort Gibson, said he was not interested in the raise and did not ask for it.
 "The voters took legislative pay totally out of legislators' hands in the 1960s, and that was a good decision, because we should not be setting our own pay," said Sneed. "The independent citizen-led board that sets our pay made this decision in October, before the pandemic, and it's unfortunate there is no mechanism for us to reject it. Many of my colleagues wish we could reject it, given the circumstances, but we are constitutionally prohibited from doing so."
 At the time the decision was made, members of the board reportedly felt legislators were not being paid enough. It wasn't long ago that the board cut legislators' pay by 8.8 percent. And before now, the last time they saw an increase was in 1997.
 "This decision was made last October, well before our current budget crisis or the COVID-19 pandemic," said State Rep. David Hardin, R-Stilwell. "It was made after legislative pay had been decreased the year before. Legislative pay is already well below many public and private sector jobs. In fact, we make less per year than the average teacher. I would, of course, work for less, as I did not take this job for the pay, but again, that is a decision made by the compensation board and not the Legislature itself."

“Think about this number: Only 19 times out of 65 games did we have our starters,” Brown said, aware of the Sixers' injury strife. “The injuries to Ben and Joel (Embiid) and J-Rich (Josh Richardson) are significant.
 “And so, as it sits, I don't believe our season is complete at all. We have more to give.”
 Whatever the Sixers give, it will be a function of Embiid's readiness. Brown tried to give assurances Friday that his center is determined to return at an optimum playing weight, but the Sixers' credibility account long has been empty on that. It's possible. But like everything else in the last seven years, it must be shown.
 Though Elton Brand and Josh Harris technically hadn't said it, they'd given sufficient indications that this is the spring when Brown must prove he can navigate a good team deep into the postseason. Written or not, Brown effectively signed off on that when he announced in the preseason that he had a roster capable of winning the Eastern Conference.
 After being made to lose for so long, and then being made to be the company front man for it all, he deserves the opportunity to prove that he is right. For that, Brown is hoping, like so many, that Adam Silver will find a healthy way to finish an NBA season that could be the Sixers' most satisfying in 20 years.
 “I think this team was built for the playoffs,” Brown said. “Like any team, you've got some non-fortunate injury situations. We get that we needed to be better on the road. We weren't. We were dominant at home. And I thought that somewhere in the middle everything was pointing to us landing the plane, getting good health and letting that environment be judgment day.
 “So I dump all my energy into, 'Let's do everything we can.' And I feel very confident and respectfully cocky that we've done good work.”
 Brown has been a good coach, surviving the process years, winning 103 regular- season games over the past two seasons, and developing the Sixers into a team capable this season of winning 29 of 31 home games. It's his turn to be confident, respectfully or otherwise.
 “Take the team that we have, the work that we've put in, and let that be the judgment day,” he said. “Let that environment be 'you-did-or-you-didn't' type of stuff. And that's how I approach it.”
 Give him some time, give his team some reasonable health, and give him a chance. From there, Brown gladly will own the rest.

“I've been with you in this city for seven years,” Brown said Friday during a video conference with the basketball press. “We've been through naviculars and pandemics and five general managers and 100-whatever players.
 “And here we are.”
 The Sixers are 39-26, sixth in Eastern Conference. But they are 29-2 at home, have had time to return Ben Simmons to basketball readiness after a back injury and, when the season resumes, will be in a position to complete the job they have been built to do. They were constructed to thrive in the playoffs, having shed the in-house success-spoiler that is Jimmy Butler, added career winner Al Horford and, at the trade deadline, acquiring veterans Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III.
 Brown believed in the Sixers' championship-readiness in training camp and he still believes it two months after the NBA took a timeout while a medical curve was flattened. More, he is convinced that once the league returns, he will have the players and the roster health to provide the proof. He believes he and his assistants have used the time off productively, making decisions about how best to utilize Tobias Harris and whether Simmons should play more at the point or in the frontcourt.
 “So against that kind of backdrop, if the season comes in, I'm excited, confident and comfortable that we are going to hit the ground running,” Brown said. “What makes that sentence whole is the players' responsibility to come in with a fitness fix so we can pull this off.
 “We do not want to use this at all as an excuse. The mission has been and will be to hunt for a championship. In many ways, I feel that carpet has been pulled from this team.”
 It has been pulled from every coach. Yet not all NBA teams are in the Sixers' position, which is just seasoned enough to be postseason-ready, just young enough to be championship-hungry and just weary enough after a six-year run-up of often unprofessional basketball to have the disposition to get it done.

Manny Diaz is encouraged by the optimism coming from campus leaders, conferences and others around the country who believe there will be a football season this fall. But the University of Miami coach understands nothing is guaranteed.
   
 Diaz, speaking on a Zoom conference call Friday, said "the next six weeks will be more important than the last six weeks," referring to the relaxed guidelines across Florida, including Miami-Dade County, the hardest hit area by the coronavirus pandemic in the state.
   
 "Now, people have a chance to come in more contact with one another than we were when we were all sheltering in one place," said Diaz, who added his message to his team is, it's not about you, it's about protecting the team.
   
 "If we have to be socially distant, we have to be socially distant. If they say we have to wear a mask when we go into a pharmacy, you got to wear a mask," he added. "It's not about your comfort, it's about protecting your team.
   
 "If you bring something into our team, if you're a corner and your asymptomatic and you play bump and run on a couple of our wideouts and four of our wideouts get it, we have a hard time fielding an offense."
   
 Diaz believes a six-week time period is the minimum to get players ready for the season, which for Miami is scheduled to start Sept. 5 at home against Temple. But his staff has been working on contingency plans in case it is less.
   
 "You'll have very different levels to conditioning," he said. "Some players have access to weights. Some players don't have access to weights. Some players have more access to cardiovascular conditioning than others.
   
 "The sooner we can get everybody together again and assess what their conditioning level is and when that happens maybe that's only six weeks before the first game. Whatever it is, we're going to make it work."
   
 Diaz was asked about the report that the presidents of the 14 SEC schools will vote as soon as next week on whether to allow athletes to return to campus on June 1 or June 15. But he's not sure that decision is totally in the presidents' hands.
   
 "Who decides who gets back on campus … it's a government decision," he said. "That's not something leagues decide. We all have to follow our elected leadership and when they give us the green light on what we have to do we go from there."
   
 ACC Commissioner John Swofford said Thursday the league is going into the year "with the anticipation of playing" football, but added "there's a lot that can happen between now and then."
   
 As for the game, Diaz does not see much changing once football is given the green light, but he is watching the German soccer league, one of the first leagues to get back to playing, to see how that fares.
   
 "Soccer still to an extent is a contact sport," he said. "Watching them and monitoring them, that will be a fascinating study for the entire world."
   
 Diaz is not sure if testing for COVID-19 will be required to get athletes, and students, back on campus or on the field. But he is confident that Miami is in as good position as anybody when it comes to making sure everyone is safe when they do return because of the leadership of its president, Julio Frenk, who has spent most of his career in public health. Frenk is the former Secretary of Health of Mexico.
   
 "That's more of a localized issue," Diaz said about testing. "You've got a whole league filled with different schools in different states and different municipalities. I know there is no school who has a university president who is an expert in public health like we do in president Frenk. So I feel as confident in terms of our ability to bring not just our student athletes but our student body back this fall in a safe manner."
   
 Diaz, and most university employees, continue to work from home. Aside from Zoom meetings, he has spent much of his time watching opponents on the 2020 schedule.
   
 UM students start summer school Monday and Diaz has told his players other than academics, the most important thing they can do is stay healthy and then get in the best condition possible.
   
 As for the new normal, nobody knows what that will be, but Diaz says Miami will be ready for anything.
   
 "There's an unpredictability with it," he said. "That's what makes things so difficult because we want to deal in absolutes and when you don't have absolutes … Just the idea of understanding we've got to live in a little bit of an uncertainty, which, by the way, that's sports, right? That's our world.
   
 "Just becoming comfortable with the uncertainty and the ability to adjust on the fly I think is going to be the key for all of us. The sports world probably lives in that domain more than most."

The state's financial position was thrown into uncertainty by the COVID-19 outbreak, creating a budget shortfall of around $1.3 billion. That crisis, in turn, has stirred up concerns over the Legislature's impending pay raises - but lawmakers insist they don't have a say in the matter.
 Last year, the Oklahoma Legislative Compensation board voted 7-2 to authorize pay increases of 35.6 percent for legislators. The raises will go into effect Nov. 18, 2020, when each lawmaker will see a boost of nearly $12,500 - from $35,021 to $47,500. And while the coronavirus has created a financial hardship for the state, officials have pointed out that the decision to raise pay was made well before the health crisis took hold.
 "An independent, constitutional board made up of private citizens made the decision in 2019, long before anyone ever heard of the coronavirus, to raise legislators' pay from an average of $35,021 to $47,500 - and that board's action cannot be undone by the Legislature," said State Sen. Kim David, R-Porter. "The Legislature did not increase its appropriations this year and will absorb the cost of the pay raises."

The plan would shift the governor’s four-region plan to an 11-region plan based on emergency management districts, officials with the organization said.

NWMC Executive Director Mark Fowler said the request to change the plan came from a handful of municipalities within the conference in the Northwest Cook County region. The original request was for a resolution to be passed that would formally ask the governor for several parameters. But Fowler said the board ultimately decided to pass a letter asking for consideration and left it up to the individual municipalities to pass resolutions.

WASHINGTON (AP) — As businesses reopened Friday in more of the U.S., an overwhelming majority of states still fall short of the COVID-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks, according to an Associated Press analysis.
 Rapid, widespread testing is considered essential to tracking and containing the coronavirus. But 41 of the nation's 50 states fail to test widely enough to drive their infections below a key benchmark, according to an AP analysis of metrics developed by Harvard's Global Health Institute.
 Among the states falling short are Texas and Georgia, which moved aggressively last month to reopen stores, malls, barbershops and other businesses.

 Erie Times-News photographer Christopher Millette captured gripping live video in mid-April at Dobbin's Landing, the hub of Erie's bayfront attractions. Winds gusting to 40 mph whipped up waves that crashed against the dock walls. Lake Erie reached historic high water levels that month and the severe weather conditions forced the temporary closure of Presque Isle State Park.
 At Tim Sedney's Rum Runners on East Dobbins Landing, water 8 to 10 inches high rushed into the building.
 Rum Runners, a bar and restaurant fronting Presque Isle Bay, in summer offers one of the best spots to admire Erie's vivid sunsets. Boaters dock at the restaurant. Pedestrians, on the other hand, have to dodge the vehicles traveling the narrow dead-end lane leading to it. The shabby route has never matched the stunning view it parallels. That's in part because the road hearkens to an earlier era when the bayfront was more about industry than leisure.
 Now, as reporter Kevin Flowers detailed, East Dobbins Landing is getting both the safeguards and fresh amenities businesses like Sedney's need to finesse this space, one of emerging Erie's most important assets.
 Crews have started work on a new $2.65 million dock wall along the bay stretching from State Street to Rum Runners. A 730-foot wall, about 1 foot higher than the existing wall, will be installed, as will a sidewalk, benches and new plantings. It is the first of several dock wall repair projects totaling an estimated $20 million-plus planned by the Erie-Western Pennsylvania Port Authority over the next several years.
 Erie Refocused consultant Charles Buki rightly called Erie's bayfront one of its most squandered assets. This improved dock wall, as Flowers noted, will help make that still mostly undeveloped area of Dobbins Landing more attractive to investors.
 It is also rightly timed to safeguard a prime Erie asset potentially at risk. For decades, investments have been made to transform the bayfront from a gritty, toxic industrial eyesore into a gleaming new district that features the Erie County Public Library, the Erie Maritime Museum, a growing list of swanky hotels and the Bayfront Convention Center, with tall glass walls that frame sweeping views of Presque Isle Bay. More ambitious development is hoped for.
 Waterfront development by its nature always requires careful planning. Extreme weather fueled by climate change in recent years has raised new awareness of the vigilance that must be exercised when creating and safeguarding shoreline attractions.
 Experts have warned that the changing climate could deliver high waters, as we have seen in recent years, and precipitous drops in lake levels.
 The new East Dobbins Landing dock wall and improvements to be made at other prime waterfront spots, including Liberty Park, are prudent investments that defend both valuable property and Erie's hopes.

When _Walker_ finally airs in January, it will start Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET, with Legacies Season 3 airing at 9 p.m. ET. In the new show, Padalecki plays Cordell Walker, a widower and father of two who returns to Austin, Texas after two years of undercover work. Once home, he tries to reconnect with his son (Kale Culley), daughter (Violet Brinson), his brother (Keegan Allen), mother (Molly Hagen) and father (Mitch Pileggi). Walker also has to come to terms with his new work situation, as his captain (Coby Bell) is a former colleague. He is also partnered with one of the first women Texas Rangers, played by _The 100_ star Lindsey Morgan.                                    Padelecki's fans will still get to see him this fall. The second half of _Supernatural_ 's 15th and final season will air on Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET, before _The Outpost_ Season 3. In _Supernatural_ , Padalecki stars as Sam Winchester, alongside Jensen Ackles as his brother Dean and Misha Collins as the angel Castiel. The series is the longest-running show in the CW's history and even predates the network, having debuted on The WB in 2005. The CW did not debut until the following year as the successor network to The WB and UPN.                                    The CW's new season will not technically start until January, as the fall schedule is made up mostly of acquired content and reality programming. January will see the launch of the new DC Comics show _Superman & Lois_ after _The Flash_ on Tuesdays. _All American_ and _Black Lightning_ will air on Mondays, with _Riverdale_ and _Nancy Drew_ on Wednesdays. Sunday will see new episodes of _Batwoman_ and _Charmed_. _Supergirl_ , _Kung Fu_ , _The Republic of Sarah_ , _DC's Legends of Tomorrow_ , _In The Dark_ , _Dynasty_ and _Roswell, New Mexico_ were held back for later in the season.                                                         *[FT]: Financial Times

As a hypothetical, the city may allow for 120 seconds for a green light on Jesse Jewell Parkway.

The Colorado Supreme Court has affirmed the ballot titles of two proposed initiatives that would impose far-reaching changes to the ballot initiative process itself and create an out-of-school learning opportunities agency through an unconventional funding mechanism.
 Initiative 245, nicknamed the “Petition Rights Amendment,” would create the right to legislate by ballot initiative in most divisions of state and local government, and would impose a $3,000 fine on those who harass or obstruct petition circulators. Among the many modifications to the initiative process, the constitutional amendment would lower the number of signatures required to place an initiative on the ballot, remove technical affidavit errors as a reason to invalidate signatures, and give the state Supreme Court sole jurisdiction to hear protests of ballot titles.
 Currently, the three-member Title Board entertains such challenges, with the high court being the appellate body of last resort. In accordance with state law, the Title Board determines if a measure pertains to a single subject and, if so, sets a title to appear before voters that is brief yet also encompasses all central features of a measure.

Some students have started online petitions asking their districts to postpone graduation until it’s safe to gather in person again. More than 1,200 people — students, parents and possibly others — signed a Whitehall High School petition. All along, Whitehall-Coplay School District officials have held out hope for a traditional ceremony later in the summer, while moving ahead with a virtual one in June.                                                                                               In Saucon Valley, where a drive-through ceremony is planned, a petition has garnered more than 300 signatures — which is almost twice the number of graduates.                                                                                               Saucon Valley Superintendent Craig Butler said 97% of students who took a survey the school sent out would attend a drive-through ceremony, in which seniors and their families will park in the school lot, and when their names are called, drive up to a staging area and pick up their diplomas.                                                                                                “We thought we should pursue an event that would be as honoring as possible and as timely as possible but still be within the regulations expressed and the restrictions expressed by the governor,” Butler said.                                                                                               Districts are trying to make up for some of what the class of 2020 is missing. Northern Lehigh High School Principal David Hauser has been tweeting about the accomplishments and plans of every senior. Parkland has created a Senior Shout Out website where staff can leave notes for seniors. High school stadiums across the Lehigh Valley lit up last month to honor athletes that missed out on their final season.                                                                                               And where schools let off, families have stepped in, with yard signs boasting that a 2020 graduate lives here.                                                                                               Jada Watkoski has attended Emmaus High School graduation ceremonies as a member of the chorale. Each year, the seniors are placed prominently in the front for their final performance of the school’s alma mater.                                                                                               "It's very emotional," she said. "I almost cried the past two years because I had friends who were graduating."                                                                                               Now that she’s a senior, Jada is hoping she has a turn to sing from the front row. Emmaus’ graduation is scheduled for June 14, with a tentative backup date of July 26, according to the district’s website. District officials plan to reschedule another major event for Jada: the school’s production of “Hello, Dolly!” which was supposed to run March 18 through March 22. Jada was a featured dancer, who helped choreograph and coordinate the dancing. The new date hasn’t yet been set.                                                                                               “You spend a lot of time working on the show and making sure it’s the best it can be, and you want to perform and be proud of what you’ve accomplished,” she said. “I was disappointed.”                                                                                               The pandemic has also affected seniors’ future plans. Emmaus senior Nicholas Thoma wanted to visit the University of Alabama and University of South Carolina. Both colleges accepted him and trips to the campuses would have helped him figure out which one fit him better. But his visits were canceled and Nicholas made his choice — the University of Alabama — based on his own research and advice from other students.

New Pratt County Clerk Lori Voss officially began her duties at the April 27 meeting of the Pratt County Commission after being sworn-in by 30th Judicial District Court Judge Frank Meisenheimer. Voss took over for retired clerk Sherry Kruse.
   
 In an update of COVID-19 response, Tim Branscom, Pratt County emergency Manager, said the state now has a system that can decontaminate up to 80,000 masks a day.
   
 Branscom said the state will pick up the masks, take them to Topeka for decontamination and return the same masks to the same location.
   
 "What we send in, we will get back," Branscom said.
   
 The state is working on the logistics on picking up and delivering the masks. The turn around time is being worked out but Branscom said he expects it to take a minimum of three days at least. Only masks that are in clean, can be contaminated. If a mask is torn, or soiled or has blood on it, it cannot be cleaned, Branscom said.
   
 Because PPE items are so scarce during the COVID-19 crisis, when they become available, it would be beneficial to the county if those items could be purchased without having to wait for the commissioners to vote on the purchase and take the chance of losing out on the item, Branscom said.
   
 "There's going to be stuff that's time sensitive that we have got to get now," Branscom said. "We want to be able to get it and come back with communication next week."
   
 Branscom, Director of Public Health Darcie Van Der Vyver and EMS Director Scott Harris would be making these purchases. Van Der Vyver said these items can be used county wide.
   
 If the funds to purchase the equipment comes from grant or stimulus, its OK to go ahead with the purchase but if the purchase has to come out of budget money, Commissioners have to approve the purchase beforehand.
   
 Reimbursement funds are available for items related to COVID-19. The county would get a 75 percent reimbursement but it may take up to a year to receive those payments, Branscom said.
   
 "We don't want to lose out on something if we can get it," Branscom said. "We would have to justify it for COVID-19."
   
 A new storm shelter could be in the future for the City of Iuka while a proposed storm shelter at the Pratt County Veterans Memorial Lake is not going to happen.
   
 Doug Freund, county road and bridge supervisor, said he has not gotten the answers he wanted for funding for the shelter at the lake so he wants to Iuka to take over the application process because the state wants to get the project rolling.
   
 Pratt County and the City of Iuka both applied for the same Kansas Department of Emergency Management grant to build a shelter. The grant was offered to the county first. Location of the shelter at the lake and who would be responsible for unlocking the facility in the event of an emergency were concerns about taking the grant. The grant is 75-25 with Federal Emergency Management Agency
   
 Tim Branscom, county emergency manager said if Iuka gets the project, it would probably do more good out there. He will contact Iuka Mayor Marcia Giggy about the matter.
   
 Sheriff Jimmy White said the Pratt County Jail is open and arrests in cases are still being made in spite of rumors to the otherwise.
   
 Spec sheets for bids on doors and windows for the Law Enforcement Center are available at the county clerks office. Exterior doors and windows are being replaced as part of an ongoing upgrade of the LEC.
   
 Freund said he wants to purchase some smaller sized culverts to help maintain the stockpile. Repairs to county roads after the 2018 Labor Day flood required replacing culverts. Freund said he probably won't get a lot because he is trying to watch the budget.
   
 Plans are underway to reopen the Pratt County Recycle Center but for the time being, the facility remains closed. Jason Winkel, landfill manager, said he is working on getting face masks available for the staff and that masks are being made.
   
 Communication specialist Mike Tibbetts said he would like to install the Power Phone software for dispatch. Power Phone would provide automatic prompts for the dispatcher during 911 calls. Right now, those prompts are on cards but with Power Phone, the prompts would be on the screen.
   
 Cost of software, installation, training and maintenance is $50,800. It qualifies for 911 funds.
   
 Several first responders will meet to discuss the software purchase and report to the commissioners at a later meeting.

The Franklin Disruptive Commerce ETF (BUYZ) is a recently launched equity ETF whose underlying companies could not be more suited to the current investment climate. I think it's an excellent vehicle through which to get exposure to some very exciting growth prospects, and is definitely worth considering giving an allocation of a small part of the speculative side of your portfolio.
 Launched at the end of February 2020, BUYZ is an actively managed disruptive commerce themed ETF which invests in companies that benefit from the secular consumer trend towards e-commerce and online transactions.
 With the current lockdown measures driving online shopping and app use higher than ever (US e-commerce sales jumped 49% in April), this small fund has started to gain some real traction in terms of returns. After a shaky start dropping almost -25% amid the market selloff of early March, its 1 month returns now stand at +23.55%, making it the second highest performing thematic ETF over the past 30 days. There is no reason why this won't continue given the popularity and growth prospects of its holdings - plus the fact that they largely benefit from people staying at home. And unlike the high risk/high- reward gamble that some narrower themes (think e-sports/gaming etc) might represent, this fund's holdings run the gamut in terms of their diversity under the disruptive commerce umbrella.
 BUYZ invests in companies throughout the world, so its global scope means it has a wide range of investment opportunities, and its holdings are exactly the types of companies that hope to profit from our new regime of staying indoors. And whether lockdown measures continue to prevail or begin to subside, the move towards e-commerce is universal and will continue to grow (Statista had predicted worldwide retail e-commerce sales alone would grow at almost 20% y-o-y, and that was before COVID-19).

As health authorities expand testing to more people, the number of positive results should shrink compared with the total number of people tested. The World Health Organization and other health researchers have said a percentage above 10% indicates inadequate testing. South Korea, a country praised for its rapid response, quickly pushed its positive cases to below 3%.
 Most governors are moving ahead with unlocking their states, even in cases where they are not meeting broad guidelines recommended by the White House.
 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has set a goal of 30,000 tests per day as his state launched one of the nation's most aggressive reopenings on May 1. He never set a firm date on when the state would hit the 30,000 mark, but for most of May, the daily testing numbers have fallen well short of that.
 Local leaders say tests are still in short supply. El Paso officials have pleaded with the governor to postpone easing up any more business restrictions in light of the COVID-19 cases there surging 60% over the past two weeks.
 The first stage of reopening in Maryland was scheduled to take effect Friday evening, when some retail stores will be allowed to reopen and a stay-at-home order lifted. But some of the hardest-hit parts of the state, including the suburbs of Washington, D.C., extended restrictions for residents and businesses.
 Maryland averaged 4,265 tests per day this week, compared with about 4,900 the previous week. Nearly 22 percent of people tested positive in Maryland on average over the last seven days.
 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan made headlines last month when the state acquired 500,000 test kits from a South Korean company in a confidential deal, but Maryland has not had all the components needed for testing — like swabs — to meet demand. Hogan said Maryland just received swabs this week from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
 "We requested 350,000," Hogan said Wednesday. "They've committed to 225,000, and I think we got 75,000 yesterday with another 125,000 that are supposedly days away, along with the tubes and the stuff that goes with them. So it's not enough, but it helps us."
 Researchers at Harvard University have calculated that the U.S. needs to test a minimum of 900,000 people per day to safely reopen the economy, based on the 10% positivity rate and several other key metrics. That goal is nearly three times the country's current daily testing tally of about 360,000, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website.
 "The fact that testing has become the Achilles' heel that has made it hard for us to have a great national response to this pandemic is a tragedy," said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard's Global Health Institute. "I'd like us to have a massive amount of ubiquitous testing so that, of all the things we need to worry about, testing isn't one of them."
 President Donald Trump insisted again this week that his administration had "met the moment" and "prevailed" on testing, even as he continued to shift responsibility for the effort to the governors. Administration officials said they will provide states with enough testing supplies to conduct about 400,000 tests per day in May and June. But that's still less than half the total recommended by the Harvard team.

 While the conversations with Beshear's administration are ongoing, Simendinger added that being an outdoor venue, the ability to spread out garage stalls for teams and the property's footprint give the speedway an advantage as far as being able to put on events safely.
 Kentucky Speedway's race dates, initially scheduled for July 9-11, have not yet been determined as NASCAR has only released a new schedule through June 21. Simendinger said scheduling is out of his hands but did say it's possible nothing changes for Kentucky Speedway's three-day show.
 The first four races back - two each at Darlington Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway - will feature condensed schedules with no practice or qualifying - one-day shows, as they're called in racing.
 With the condensed schedule, NASCAR is also implementing some format changes, such as inverting the race field based on previous results and shorter-length races. The field won't be fully inverted but will instead be broken into two 20-car groups based on Sunday's results, and those two groups will be inverted - the first-place finisher Sunday will start 20th on Wednesday night.
 "Some of the stuff that you're going to see are all things that have been going on behind the scenes and you've probably been hearing rumors about for a long time," Simendinger said. "Cup races for 310 miles - we don't have any Cup races that are 310 miles ... at any intermediate (1.5-mile) tracks. We're going to have those during the week now - weekday racing. We've been talking about weekday racing for a long time. Now, we'll have the opportunity to try that."
 As far as Sunday's race, Simendinger said he can't wait to watch what happens when the field goes into the treacherous first turn at Darlington.
 "When (the drivers) don't practice and they haven't raced for a while ... (NASCAR) is going to tell everyone, 'Now listen, use your heads, be smart, everybody, you know, long race' and as soon as they drop the green flag, everybody's just going to start racing like they haven't raced in two months, which is exactly the way it is," Simendinger said. "It should be a lot of fun and really cool to watch."
 Speaking of the possibility of a condensed or altered schedule for Kentucky this year, Simendinger said he was amenable to whatever it takes.
 "Honestly, I would love to be where Darlington is right now," Simendinger said. "I wouldn't mind if we hosted five of these races, you know. I would wish they'd see green walls from now until the Fourth of July. ... You guys know how I feel about this place, I love this place. I want to show it off.
 "I love the name of our speedway - it's Kentucky Speedway. It's not, you know, some corporate speedway. People know it's Kentucky, and I like the fact that when they see this place, they know that Quaker State is our sponsor, there's no doubt about it."
 Last year's Quaker State 400 saw one of the best finishes in recent NASCAR history, when Kurt Busch and Kyle Busch battled with Kurt getting his first win of the season and the first Cup Series win ever for Chevrolet at Kentucky Speedway.
 "I would say that it was the best finish of the year," Simendinger said. "We were coming in with such momentum because of that race. That was a fantastic race. ... Last year, there was a new downforce package from NASCAR and a new way of conditioning the track that Speedway Motorsports came up with. And the result was a fantastic race."
 Traction compound was used to condition the speedway last year and Simendinger said the track will be prepared the same way this year since there won't be any changes to the way cars are prepared for 1.5-mile tracks.
 With the green flag set to wave at Darlington on Sunday, Simendinger echoed what a lot of fans of motorsports have been thinking since the revised schedule was announced.
 "It's great to be back talking about racing," Simendinger said. "I'm really proud of NASCAR and how they've gone about (working to return). I think their approach has been incremental. I know that it's geared toward safety first, which is important, but I think it's really important that we get back up and going. If we can do this thing safely, let's do it. So, I can't wait to see the cars at Darlington."

We all have images of ourselves in our mind’s eye. Mine says I’m still 22.
 But at this point, I’m so unkempt, I feel like I’ll never be cute, again. It’s gotten so bad, my once manicured nails are catching on the cotton weave of my baggy T-shirt. How did they get so raggedy when all I do is put dishes in the dishwasher, do three or four pieces of laundry a week, dust a little and take out the trash?
 Same for the piglets. I could cut my own finger and toe nails, but I like to help the small businesses in my area, even if I did end up with a toenail condition that will never go away. The doctor suggested the harmless fettle could be hidden quite nicely with a strong coat of polish. I know I’m not alone.
 But I’ve gotten lazy.
 I miss my warm, oily leg massages with strong hands that know what they are doing.
 I don’t miss foundation make-up, though. I haven’t worn Covergirl for the 53 days, seven hours and three seconds. It feels good, but I swear my facial skin is sliding south. My cheeks used to be even with my nose.
 Oh, never mind what’s happening to the other cheeks. The stationary bike is a liar.
 Before the lockdown, I bought a bright yellow outfit to take to Texas with me for my annual Flying Tiger Line reunion which would have been this week. We were going to drive all over the state after the reunion to visit friends and relatives.
 Now, I’m grudgingly back on Weight Watcher points so that I can wear the cheerful attire to celebrate the eventual end of the planet’s social fast. Now _that’s_ incentive.
 Needless to say, I’m ready for this to be over.
 When I said “I do” almost 35 years ago, I never really thought I was saying “I do” to a commitment of looking at my spouse for days, weeks and months on end in limited quarters. Thank goodness he’s easy on the eyes. I pity him, though.
 I once read a fascinating book about Siamese twins who lived their whole lives together during a time when medical technology wasn’t advanced enough to successfully separate them. They seldom talked to each other because they experienced everything in their lives exactly the same.
 That’s how this isolation is in our house.
 “Look at the humming bird circling around us, dear.”
 “Oh, you saw it.”
 “The dog just did a rolling stumble and almost caught that squirrel.”
 “Oh, you saw that, too?”
 And so goes the minutes of our lives until we are able to go our separate ways, then come together at the end of the day and share our adventures.
 Gratefully, a friend called this morning with some good news. Great balls of fire!—our golf course is opening up and we already have our tee time back!
 Yikes. I better go shave my legs.

Press Secretary Kayleigh "I Will Never Lie to You" McEnany was duly dispatched to tell the White House press corp that the document published by the AP was a preliminary version, awaiting final approval from CDC head Dr. Robert Redfield, which prompted the immediate leak of emails showing that he'd actually approved them weeks earlier and had been trying to get the White House to sign off since April 10. And then, for good measure, someone inside the CDC passed the AP a 63-page unpublished draft of guidelines specifying in granular detail exactly what steps institutions needed to take to safely reopen. Whoops!  
 Which put the White House in an awkward position, since Trumpland had told the CDC its detailed decision-making rubric for reopening schools, restaurants, day care facilities, religious institutions, and public transit would "never see the light of day," according to the AP, and now everyone in DC had a copy of it. Meanwhile in the absence of federal guidance, states like Georgia, Florida, and Texas are already opening up using plans based as much on the demands of businesses as on public health best practices. So the White House went back to the CDC and told them to revive the guidelines, but this time replace all that annoying detail with graphics and pablum.

BALTIMORE (AP) — U.S. retail sales tumbled by a record 16.4% from March to April as business shutdowns caused by the coronavirus kept shoppers away, threatened the viability of stores across the country and further weighed down a sinking economy.
 The Commerce Department’s report Friday on retail purchases showed a sector that has collapsed so fast that sales over the past 12 months are down a crippling 21.6%. The severity of the decline is unrivaled for retail figures that date back to 1992. The monthly decline in April nearly doubled the previous record drop of 8.3% — set just one month earlier.
 “It’s like a hurricane came and leveled the entire economy, and now we’re trying to get it back up and running,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist for the consultancy Maria Fiorini Ramirez.
 Shapiro said he thinks retail sales should rebound somewhat as states and localities reopen their economies. But he said overall sales would remain depressed “because there is going to be a big chunk of the lost jobs that don’t come back.”
 The sharpest declines from March to April were at clothing, electronics and furniture stores. A long-standing migration of consumers toward online purchases is accelerating, with that segment posting a 8.4% monthly gain. Measured year over year, online sales surged 21.6%.
 Other than online, not a single retail category was spared in April. Auto dealers suffered a monthly drop of 13%. Furniture stores absorbed a 59% plunge. Electronics and appliance stores were down over 60%. Retailers that sell building materials posted a drop of roughly 3%. After panic buying in March, grocery sales fell 13%.
 Clothing-store sales tumbled 79%, department stores 29%. Restaurants, some of which are already starting to close permanently, endured a nearly 30% decline despite shifting aggressively to takeout and delivery orders.
 For a retail sector that had already been reeling, a back-to-back free-fall in spending poses a grave risk. Department stores, restaurants and auto dealerships are in danger. Nearly $1 of every $5 spent at retailers last month went to non-store retailers, evidence that the pandemic has accelerated the shift toward online shopping.
 Retailers are being imperiled not only by business shutdowns mandated by states and localities but also by a record loss of 36 million jobs over the past two months. The layoffs and reduced hours have encouraged a pullback in spending.
 Lindsay Fulton, a 29-year-old from suburban Richmond, Virginia, who was furloughed from her sales job at the end of March, said that what little shopping she does now is online. She has no plans to visit stores anytime soon.
 “I’ve done more online shopping than I ever had before,” she said. “I feel like, across the board, everyone’s habits have changed.”
 In the past two weeks, J.Crew, Neiman Marcus and Stage Stores have filed for bankruptcy protection. J.C. Penney appears on the verge of following them. UBS estimates that roughly 100,000 stores could shutter over the next five years.
 “The whole economic model is unraveling,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “This is going to be very painful. For some, it’s going to be fatal.”
 An April analysis by a group of academic economists found that a one-month closure could wipe out 31% of non-grocer retailers. A four-month closure could force 65% to close.
 The plunge in retail spending is a key reason why the U.S. economy is contracting. Retail sales account for roughly half of all consumer spending, which fuels about 70% of total economic activity. The rest of consumer spending includes services like cellphone and internet contracts, gym memberships and child care.
 With few Americans shopping, traveling, eating out or otherwise spending normally, economists have estimated that the gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic activity — is shrinking in the April-June quarter at a roughly 40% annual rate. That would be the deepest quarterly drop on record.
 The pressures being exerted on retail are also being felt globally. Among the European countries that share the euro currency, retail sales fell a painful 11.2% from February to March.
 Spending tracked by Opportunity Insights suggests that consumer spending might have bottomed out around mid-April before beginning to tick up slightly, at least in the clothing and general merchandise categories. But spending on transportation, restaurants, hotels and arts and entertainment remains severely depressed.
 Even with the sales declines, the pandemic is forcing shifts in what people buy as they adjust to working at home. CSolutions, which monitors sales of packaged goods, has noted a shift to comfort and convenience. Sales of baking flour, tomato sauces, ice cream, premixed cocktails and breakfast sausages have surged from a year ago.
 Pajama-buying rocketed 143% from March to April, according to Adobe Analytics, which monitors online retailers. By contrast, sales of pants, jackets and bras have declined.
 Cody Pipper, a sales associate for a 16-store chain called Litehouse Pools and Spas, says he’s noticed that more people are now spending in ways that serve their at-home lifestyles. Pipper, 24, of Elyria, Ohio, said he himself spent $2,500 for a Peloton exercise bike for his wife, a medical assistant who recently returned to work. He said they expect to spend less on dining out and shopping at the mall.
 “I’ve had a really good time with the family hanging out, watching TV,” said Pipper who has a 1-year-old son. “I think this is the norm. This is what we are supposed to do now.”

ABC has already renewed _American Idol_ for Season 4, but whether the current roster of talent will return is still up in the air. While Season 4 is definitely on the way, host Ryan Seacrest, as well as judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie are all currently unsigned, according to _The Hollywood Reporter_.                                  This is the second year in a row that the singing competition series has been renewed ahead of re-signing Seacrest or the judges. They all returned to their roles eventually, first all three judges signed on in August of 2019, with Seacrest following a month later. In 2018, the host was previously reported to make about $12 million per season, the same as Bryan. Perry was making the most at $25 million per season, while Richie was taking in $10 million.                                  The series has also undergone a total revamp due to the coronavirus pandemic by pivoting to remote webcasts from everyone's homes -- including its numerous contestants. In April, Perry took to Facebook Live to talk about the show's mid-season pivot, which was put in place to help slow the spread of coronavirus. "Well, I think that we're all gonna have to be very creative," Perry said. "Know that we're going to get really creative and you'll just have to be tuning into that creativity that we are probably going to create from our individual homes. We'll see how this goes."                                  These changes will mean that the Season 3 finale will be the first of its kind, with contestants singing for approval from the comfort of their homes. Along with the usual competition, the Sunday finale will feature performances by judges Perry and Bryan, as well as Rascal Flatts, Lauren Daigle and Cynthia Erivo, who'll sing a medley of Aretha Franklin songs. Richie, meanwhile, will lead a version of "We Are the World" with Season 3's top 11 singers, his two fellow judges along with past _Idol_ contestants. The roster will include Alejandro Aranda, Fantasia, Gabby Barrett, Jordin Sparks, Katharine McPhee, Kellie Pickler, Laine Hardy, Lauren Alaina, Phillip Phillips, Ruben Studdard and Scotty McCreery.                                  The show's last remaining contestants include Julia Gargano, Arthur Gunn, Dillon James, Just Sam, Louis Knight, Francisco Martin and Johnny West. They'll compete for the top spot when the Season 3 finale of _American Idol_ will air Sunday at 8 p.m. on ABC.                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Review
 CAPONE (2020)
 Tom Hardy, Linda Cardellini, Matt Dillon, Kyle MacLachlan, Noel Fisher
 Directed by Josh Trank
 Writer-director Josh Trank must hate Al Capone. How else do you explain this dreadful biopic? If your idea of a good time includes Tom Hardy under heavy prosthetics pooping in bed and peeing in his pants, while more flies than “The Amityville Horror” circle around, then I’ve got a movie for you. If Trank's intention was to make an avant-garde film, in part he succeeds. But overall "Capone" is just bizarre and without much of a plot.
 In 1931, Capone was sentenced to prison for tax evasion. His physical and mental abilities began to deteriorate rapidly while in lockup so after a decade he was no longer deemed a threat and released to live in exile while under surveillance by the feds. The film's setting is a mansion in Palm Island, Florida where former gangster Al “Scarface” Capone (Tom Hardy) is surrounded by family including wife Mae (Linda Cardellini) and adult son Junior (Noel Fisher). He’s only 48, but the dementia and late-stage syphilis have left the notorious gangster with the mentality of a 12-year old.
 Through most of the film Capone sits outdoors staring out at a swamp on his property filled with alligators while he mumbles incoherently, sounding like Nick Nolte fighting a cold. He’s only clearly understood when speaking Italian and that's because of the subtitles. The pale makeup and bloodshot eyes give the English actor a zombie look and on more than one occasion the audience feels like it's stepped into a horror film.
 Capone is also paranoid and delusional. We watch as rolls into fits of rage claiming that he's being watched. His mansion is wire-tapped and yes the feds are watching, especially Agent Crawford (Jack Lowden) who listens in around the clock hoping to learn the whereabouts of a reported $10 million in cash that Capone stashed away before going to the slammer. The hidden loot is mentioned throughout the film, but the plot goes nowhere. 29-year old Lowden, with his boyish looks, seems miscast as Capone’s adversary. Although at this juncture, Capone is only a threat to his underwear which gets soiled more than once and let's just say it gets graphic.
 The wonderful Linda Cardellini as Capone’s wife Mae unfortunately doesn’t have much to do in the film. She gets agitated at her husband often, and at his henchman when they call him Al instead of his nickname "Fonse" which is short for Alphonse. Apparently Al brings back memories of his days as a crime boss so the name has been banned by Mae.
 The cast also includes Kyle MacLachlan as Doctor Karlock who brings Capone fresh diapers and offers advice to Mae that includes keeping family around to help take care of her deteriorating husband. The doc is also aware of the hidden loot and tries to get Capone to divulge its whereabouts when Mae's not around. Capone's brother Ralphie (Al Sapienza) is also around and so is former enforcer Gino (Gino Cafarelli) who gets bloody and violent in a flashback scene. The story also hints at an illegitimate son named Tony (Mason Guccione) who continuously calls and then hangs up. There's not much background on Tony and so the subplot fizzles out.
 I should also mention Matt Dillon’s appearance as a gangster figure from Capone’s past who may or may not be a figment of his imagination. Dillon looks great as if he hasn't aged over the years.
 When working with such a fascinating figure as Al Capone, the possibilities are limitless for a first-rate film. From his beginnings in New York with small-time racketeers, to his move to Chicago where he became an enforcer and then later the city’s top crime boss which led to the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre. However, Trank is focused on late stage Capone where the former gangster has been reduced to a fart machine who utters “uh-oh” each time he lets one loose.
 Trank burst onto the scene with 2012’s entertaining sci-fi thriller “Chronicle” but followed that up with the disastrous re-imaging of Marvel’s “Fantastic Four” in 2015. It’s been five years and now the writer-director resurfaces with this bizarre biopic that features at least one action scene as Capone shoots up everything in sight with a gold Tommy Gun but then you notice he's also walking around in a diaper that seems to be carrying a full load. Maybe that's his way of saying I made a poopy, now someone please change me.
