Mexico took a step closer to legalizing marijuana for recreational and medicinal use on Thursday as the Senate approved a bill aimed at reducing violence linked to drug trafficking. The legislation still requires approval by the lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, which has until December 15 to study and debate it. "Its objective is to promote peace and security in society, contributing to the reduction of the illegal market for psychoactive cannabis and with it, organized crime, corruption and violence," the Senate said in a statement. The bill was approved by 82 votes in favor, 18 against and seven abstentions. A landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2015 opened the door to the recreational use of marijuana in Mexico. But it is still illegal to carry more than five grams (0.18 ounces), which would increase to 28 grams under the proposed law. Anyone found to be carrying between 28 and 200 grams would be fined, and anyone with more than 200 grams could be criminally prosecuted. Individuals would be allowed to grow six plants per person at home for their own consumption. As part of their campaign, Mexican pro-legalization activists have planted a marijuana garden right outside the Senate that has become an oasis for cannabis smokers. Mexico is plagued by drug-related violence. Since the government militarized the fight against the powerful drug cartels in 2006, there have been around 296,000 murders.

Badulak said the reason the team chose this particular machine -- which doctors use sparingly because it requires special training to operate -- is because Knapinski's organs were so cool from the freezing conditions that the organs were able to function with less oxygen, which essentially buys doctors more time to restart the heart.
 After 45 minutes, the ECMO machine had successfully gotten Knapinski's blood flowing. The team then warmed his body back to a temperature that the heart could function at and shocked his heart one more time.
 "We knew the heart would start beating again," Badulak said. "The main concern was his brain and if there had been any permanent damage while his heart was stopped."
 Two days later, Knapinski opened his eyes for the first time.
 "When I woke up, I just really didn't comprehend what had happened," said Knapinski, according to WPVI-TV. "I'm extremely grateful to everybody here at the hospital for not giving up on me. I'm alive and breathing."
 Knapinski was discharged after just eight days in the hospital, and Budak said he will make a fully recovery.
 "In the five years that we've had an ECMO program at Harborview, we've only had a handful of people walk out of the hospital after hypothermic cardiac arrest. So, Michael's case is certainly uncommon," she said. "That guys is going to live for decades."

Relatives of 12 Hong Kong democracy activists detained in mainland China released balloons carrying messages to their loved ones across the border on Saturday, as they called for their return.
 It has been 90 days since the 12 were arrested by the Chinese coast guard in late August when fleeing their city for Taiwan by boat.
 Most of those aboard the vessel were being prosecuted in Hong Kong for crimes linked to last year's huge and often violent pro-democracy protests.
 They have since disappeared into the mainland's notoriously opaque, party- controlled legal system on immigration charges.
 Family members climbed a small hill on the outlying island of Kat O, in northeastern Hong Kong just across the harbour from Yantian in Shenzhen, where the 12 Hong Kongers are being held.
 "After I come up here, I feel I'm closer to him," Wong Wai-yin’s mother told AFP, overlooking Yantian from the hilltop.
 "It's almost within reach, but it's still out of reach."
 The relatives and some supporters held up a banner reading "SAVE 12", and released balloons with the names of and messages to their loved ones.
 "Miss you so much. Come home soon," one balloon read.
 Some of the relatives recently received handwritten letters from their loved ones for the first time since their arrest.
 The letters were passed by lawyers appointed by the Chinese government after family-appointed counsel were denied access to the detainees, a common move by authorities in sensitive or political cases.
 "There was no news about them at all before. So when I received his letter, my wife and I cried bitterly," said the father of Cheng Tsz-ho, who was also at the hilltop, adding that they finally knew their son was still alive.
 “No matter what they have been accused of, deep down in their hearts, they really love Hong Kong. I hope mainland China can return them to Hong Kong as soon as possible."
 In a statement, family members said the letters warning relatives against speaking to the media and seemed to adhere to a template and were probably written under duress.
 They continued to call for their lawyers' access to the clients, and the immediate safe return of the 12.
 Forced confessions, torture and lengthy incommunicado detention have been well documented inside mainland China's legal system.

All Battle wanted was a chance for revenge against the team that ended its season the previous year, but by halftime the Spartans were down 28-14.
 It was just the third time all season that the Spartans trailed at the break, but they were 1-1 in the previous two games. They had kept the Panthers from a three-touchdown lead, scoring on a quick, four-play drive that was capped by a 7-yard touchdown by quarterback Khaleel Dampier.
 Still, Battle needed a touchdown to start the second half.
 The Spartans had kept a clean sheet on offense in the first half — no penalties, no fumbles, no turnovers — but within seconds of the clock restarting that sheet became muddied. On a Dampier handoff the ball slipped loose for Battle's first fumble of the game. The Spartans recovered, but lost 4 yards.
 The next play, a high snap caused another fumble and set Battle back 11 more yards. When Dampier converted on third-and-25 with a 30-yard run Fort Zumwalt was called for holding, a personal foul on the Spartans offset the penalties and repeated the down. Battle lost 3 yards on the repeat and punted on fourth- and-28.
 "It's mistakes," coach Atiyyah Ellison said. "That's all it is is. They're kids, I get it, but we didn't do enough to win."
 Just as Ellison predicted, mistakes determined the game as Battle fell 35-14 against Fort Zumwalt North in the MSHSAA Class 5 State Quarterfinal. It was the second straight year the Panthers have knocked the Spartans out of postseason play.
 Ellison took some responsibility for the loss, citing the fact that he's the one who decides how his team prepares for each game. Obviously, something about this week's preparation hadn't quite clicked when Battle (8-2) reached game time.
 "It's one of those soul-searching things and it's like I have to look back on my preparation for the game," he said. "I gotta take ownership for the loss at the end of the day. For whatever reason, we weren't ready, so I got to take ownership for that."
 Fort Zumwalt (11-1) largely stuck to the same patterns and plays it used when it played at Battle in Week 1. The Panthers accumulated over 400 offensive yards on the ground, while going just 1-for-2 and 12 yards passing.
 Quarterback Jack Newcomb and running backs Tyler Oakes and Chris Futrell split most of the carries for Fort Zumwalt — as they did in Week 1— with Futrell scoring three of the team's five touchdowns. Newcomb and Oakes scored the other two.
