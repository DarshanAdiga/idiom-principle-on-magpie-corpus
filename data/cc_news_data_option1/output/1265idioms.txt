For now, however, all we can do is abide by the rules and we should. It is in our collective best interest for this lockdown to be successful in slowing down the rate of new transmission because that will indeed help to flatten the pandemic curve in the long run. But we must be honest with ourselves about all the things it will not do, and about all the things its modalities will. We cannot relent in firming up our health system and safeguarding the health of the frontline workers who will stand in the breach for all of us in the weeks ahead.

One of the film’s most insightful and endearing qualities is how much it’s willing to poke fun at Rob, Barry, and Dick’s record-clerk arrogance without belittling their passions entirely. They have good taste. The music means something to them. And every once in a while, it can connect them to other people. Like when Dick courts a Green Day fan by introducing her to Stiff Little Fingers. (Absolutely no experience more awkward than trying to turn someone on to new music as they’re standing right in front of you.) Or when Barry preaches the gospel of the Jesus and Mary Chain’s Psychocandy. Or when Rob bets he can sell five copies of the Beta Band’s The Three EPs by playing it in the store.

LONDON -- World stocks looked set to close their worst quarter since 2008 on a brighter note on Tuesday, as strong Chinese factory data held out hope for an economic revival even as much of the rest of the world shut down to fight the coronavirus.


  Stocks have rallied since the start of last week but remain down more than 20% for the quarter. European shares have had an even worst time, suffering their worst three months since 1987.


  But with trillions wiped off global markets in March and policymakers responding with more than $10 trillion and counting of fiscal and monetary stimulus packages, a semblance of calm has returned this week.


  Some analysts have been bold enough to call a bottom in stocks and say the lows of early last week are unlikely to be revisited.


  European stocks rallied at the open. The Euro STOXX gained 1.7%, France's CAC 40 1.15% and the German DAX 2.08%. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 1.8%.


  That followed gains in Asia after China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 52.0 in March from a record-low 35.7 in February, topping forecasts of 45.0.


  Analysts cautioned that underlying activity probably remained below par, since the improvement measured the net balance of companies reporting an expansion or contraction, but markets cheered the news.


  S&P 500 futures rose 0.6%, pointing to a stronger open on Wall Street after a rally on Monday lifted the U.S. index towards a 20% gain since the lows of last week.


  Despite the more positive mood, not everyone is convinced the current rally has legs.


  "In spite of the significant sell-off of most growth-oriented assets since mid-February, we are concerned there is further downside ahead," said Salman Baig, an investment manager at Unigestion.


  "The violent market action should not be understated, but the underlying cause - an accelerating pandemic requiring large parts of the economy to shut down - is still with us."


  The pace of coronavirus infections globally was heading towards 800,000. But Deutsche Bank analysts noted that for two consecutive days the global growth in new cases was 10%, after being well above that for most of the past two weeks.


  Health officials are much more cautious. A World Health Organisation official warned on Tuesday that even in the Asia-Pacific region the epidemic was "far from over."


  "This is probably the most embarrassing statistic for the West that China could possibly release. Not only did China stop the virus with just 3,309 deaths, they also appear to have done it with just a one-month shutdown of the economy," Charlie Robertson, the chief economist at Renaissance Capital, said on Twitter.


  Some analysts dispute China's figures, however.


  OIL BOUNCES


  Elsewhere, oil prices rose off the 18-year lows hit on Monday after the United States and Russia agreed to talks to stabilize energy markets.


  Oil prices have been hit by a double whammy, with U.S. crude at one point falling below $20 a barrel on Monday, as the virus outbreak cut demand worldwide and Saudi Arabia got into a price war with Russia.


  Brent crude was up 43 cents, or 1.9%, at $23.19 a barrel, after closing on Monday at $22.76, its lowest finish since November 2002. nL4N2BO131


  U.S. crude was up $1.21, or 6.0%, at $21.30 a barrel, after settling in the earlier session at $20.09, its lowest since February 2002.


  The dollar rose for a second day, although the gains were more controlled than the jumps of earlier this month that put severe stress on funding markets for the U.S. currency.


  The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, was up 0.3% at 99.493.


  The euro dropped 0.4% to $1.0995. Sterling slipped 0.7% to $1.2330. The yen was 0.5% lower against the dollar.


  Analysts say investors rebalancing their portfolios at month-end and quarter- end were probably behind some of the dollar's moves over the next 24 hours.


  There was little respite for emerging-market currencies, however. The South African rand was near record lows and Latin American currencies were falling once again.


  Bond market moves were more measured than in recent weeks. Italian government bond yields were steady before an auction of debt, amid hopes the country's efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus may be starting to work.


  German benchmark 10-year yields rose 5 basis points to -0.474%. U.S. Treasury yields gained 2 to 4 bps, as investors sold safer bonds and bought into equities. (Additional reporting by Sujata Rao in London, Wayne Cole in Sydney and Alun John in Hong Kong; editing by Larry King)

The lockdown will not reduce the total number of people who end up getting infected in the long run either if a vaccine or cure is not found before it is over. Fewer people will be infected and new cases will appear less frequently in the enforcement window, but there will still be some ongoing transmission. It will simply take a much longer time for everyone to get infected because movement is more limited and contacts less frequent. What a lockdown represents, in reality, is a stalling tactic. It will limit the rate of new infections, but its effects will not be felt for at least two more weeks.

Când persoana respectivă a revenit după câteva luni și mi-a spus că i-am fost de mare ajutor și vrea să continuăm cu o serie nouă, am decis că este corect să dau structură și metodologie colaborării și ajutorul să se bazeze și pe teorie, nu numai pe practică.

It was a great action set-piece, providing a nice contrast to the more introspective character moments of the rest of the season. While season three is clearly moving beyond some of the high-stakes drama of the first two seasons, these moments of violence, transposed from the park to the real world, add to the danger of Delores and her quest to take down humanity.<br

Robin van Persie has lifted the lid on the conversations he held with Sir Alex Ferguson after signing for Manchester United - and how he'd been promised the manager would stay for another three years.


  Ferguson retired from management in May 2013 after guiding United to their 13th Premier League title, with Van Persie - a new signing that season - playing a huge part.


  But the Scot's announcement that he was leaving the job behind came as a shock announcement, to Van Persie and to senior players who had been at Old Trafford for years.


  The Dutchman, who had signed from Arsenal at the start of the 2012/13 season admits feeling disappointed that he didn't work with Ferguson for longer.


  "(He left) a great void," Van Persie said in an interview with SoFoot.


  "Even Ryan Giggs didn't know he was going to stop. Neither (Paul) Scholes nor (Rio) Ferdinand, even if they had worked for him for so many years, they had not seen it coming.


  "Just before signing, I asked him, 'What are your plans? How many more years do you stay?' He had told me that he planned to stay at least three more years.


  "For me, it was therefore a great disappointment, because I had signed to Manchester United for him.


  "This is life, the coaches come and go, the players are transferred. We must move forward.


  "But when people saw Sir Alex Ferguson pulling out, everyone knew it was going to be very hard for the club."

Abituato a trascorrere a Londra la stagione invernale e ad East Bergholt quella estiva, nel 1811 si trasferisce a Salisbury per far visita a John Fisher. Pochi anni più tardi deve fare i conti con l'opposizione del nonno paterno di Maria Bicknell, sua amica di gioventù con la quale ha intrapreso una relazione sentimentale. Si tratta del rettore di East Bergholt, che reputando i Constable una famiglia socialmente inferiore alla propria intende escludere la ragazza dall'eredità nel caso in cui ella si unisca in matrimonio con John. Ciò rappresenterebbe un grande problema per lo stesso John, il quale con un matrimonio poverissimo, privo del patrimonio della famiglia Bicknell, non potrebbe più continuare a fare il pittore.

But more difficult still will be the way out. And it will not be long before millions of businesses and most of the country will want to know what that is.'


  He added: 'Any successful mitigation of the loss of jobs and livelihoods will require, in the fairly near future, some hope that there is a plan for the next stage.'


  He said some businesses could choose to 'abandon' their ventures if there is no light at the end of the tunnel.


  Businesses will need to know 'before April is out' what the government is 'going to do next and when we are going to do it', he said.


  'Having some increasing hope, some rising certainty, some end in sight, will be crucial in preserving millions of jobs,' he added.


  South Korea and a number of other Asian countries have had success in reducing the impact of coronavirus because of mass testing programmes and Lord Hague said the UK needed to follow suit for the future.


  Being able to identify who has the disease and to establish who they have been in contact with would enable authorities to stop the spread and allow businesses to remain open.


  Lord Hague said it would 'not be wise' to 'bet' the UK's prosperity on the swift development of a vaccine or 'herd immunity' and suggested testing should be viewed as the UK's best hope.


  The former Cabinet minister said countries are likely to soon be divided into those with major testing programmes and those without.


  The former will likely face a recession while the latter will face a depression, he claimed.

“Elevated volatility is not unusual during geopolitical disruption and will undoubtedly continue. More relevant, however, are the underlying drivers of equity returns and the outlook for the likely trajectory of the recovery. For the time being, market moves reflect the fear of the unknown as well as the deterioration in the economic environment and growth expectations. Unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus is thus being brought to bear to support economic activity.”

The World Bank's outlook is grim - to say the least.


  Unavoidable significant pain in all countries - that's the World Bank's forecast for growth in the East Asia region this year.


  The poor will get poorer - and there will be more of them - and even rich countries will struggle to keep businesses and households afloat.


  In China, where the outbreak began, the bank says the virus's impact on the economy will see growth slow to 2.3% this year from 6.1% last year. But that's if the pandemic doesn't get worse. If it does, growth could be just 0.1% this year. The bank's forecasts for other countries in east Asia are similarly grim.


  Worse still, according to the bank, will be the serious impact on poverty, both directly through illness and indirectly through lost incomes. Those in the informal sector will be hardest hit, and will need the most help.


  Asia - and in particular China - has been the world's economic engine for the past decade. The coronavirus pandemic has stopped that growth in its tracks. Recovery will be long and difficult.
