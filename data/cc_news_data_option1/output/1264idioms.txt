Law360 (March 30, 2020, 8:40 PM EDT) -- The Chinese unit of PwC and a group of underwriters were dropped on Monday from a stock-drop suit that accuses the Beijing-based data analytics company Gridsum of misrepresenting its financials.      A New York federal judge said Gridsum Holding Inc.'s investors hadn't shown that the company's registration statement for its 2016 initial public offering contained material misstatements about its revenue and its internal controls, so Securities Act claims against Gridsum, its former PwC unit auditor and the underwriters for its IPO cannot go forward.      U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos did not, however, let Gridsum off the hook, finding that its allegations that...

Chromebooks have become critical.


   


  For many Erie County school districts, the laptop computers are essential to ensure that all students can learn online during the school shutdown due to COVID-19.


   


  The Girard School District already handed out Chromebooks.


   


  The Erie School District plans to distribute them.


   


  So does the Millcreek Township School District.


   


  The Chromebooks are going to students who have no computers at home.


   


  The lack of technology and internet access at home is a challenge for school districts with a high percentage of students classified as economically disadvantaged by the state. They include the Erie School District (77 percent), Iroquois School District (74 percent), Girard (57 percent) and even Millcreek (44 percent).


   


  In the rural Union City Area School District, where 64 percent of the students are economically disadvantaged, the lack of home computers and internet access is acute.


   


  "The geography of our district makes it impossible to go strictly online," Union City schools Superintendent Matthew Bennett told me. "We have done connectivity tests through providers and they have confirmed that connectivity is a huge issue."


   


  More affluent Erie County school districts are more fortunate. Though some of their students lack internet access, most if not all students have computers -- because the districts can afford to provide them.


   


  In the Fairview School District, all students get iPads. In the General McLane School District, iPads go to students in fifth through 12th grades.


   


  About 22 percent of Fairview's students are classified as economically disadvantaged. The figure is 39 percent for General McLane.


   


  Fairview was the first of Erie County's 13 school districts to go to mandatory online learning during the virus-related shutdown. General McLane followed.


   


  The hard work of Fairview Superintendent Erik Kincade and General McLane Superinendent Rick Scaletta and their staffs helped the two districts plunge fully into virtual instruction.


   


  The other Erie County superintendents are also developing plans for distance education -- with and without online classes.


   


  How different the situation would be if the federal or state governments or other funding sources guaranteed that all students, no matter where their school districts, had computers and internet access at home.


   


  Then students would have Chromebooks ahead of a crisis.

It has been nearly two years since TPLF stood down from the EPRDF four-party coalition government. The TPLF led EPRDF government was of course in power nearly three decades. The regime succumbed in the face of massive unarmed popular rising of Oromo Protest and withdrew to its home base of "fortress Tigray". The popular rising was spearheaded in the main by Qeerroo (Oromo Youth) and their Faannoo, Zerma, and other allies, with Qeerroo paying the heaviest price in thousands of lives. The sacrifices inspired and spurred into action some patriotic members within the TPLF sponsored OPDO bringing to the fore a courageous few known as "team Lemma", which helped ensure the TPLF chastening retreat. This triumph compelled the emergence of OPDO as the leading corps among the four outfits (TPLF, OPDO/ODP, APDM/ADP & SENNP) that constituted the EPRDF with the new OPDO/EPRDF leader refreshingly apologizing for the mayhem of state terrorism of the EPRDF regime. He in the same breath pledged to uphold the existing constitution and supremacy of the law, strengthen democratic institutions and put the country on a new development path. As a result, on the positive side, political prisoners were set free, freedom of expression upheld and all political parties allowed to openly and peacefully conduct their political activities. This is celebrated as a real "spring of freedom" in the history of modern Ethiopia. The situation contrasts the brief interlude of freedom of expression for major political players between the demise of Emperor Haile Selassie's regime and the ascendance of the military regime, the Derg. A partial exception now would be the treatment being meted out to Oromo parties including the Oromo Liberation Front, which once again has thousands of its members and supporters in detention without due process of law.

There is gold here, although some geologists say that Otis and Excellon exaggerate the lode. Critics say it is low-grade ore, so massive quantities would need to be excavated, crushed and leached with a cyanide solution to chemically extract what gold there is.


  One fear is that contaminants from the process will inevitably migrate into the region’s water.


  Excellon Resources says the Kilgore Project is just the beginning. “Kilgore — Significant Room to Grow” the company proclaims in a presentation.


  Importantly, Craig T. Lindsay, previously Otis Gold’s president and CEO, once told an interviewer, “There’s no royalties on it.”


  Under America’s 1872 General Mining Act — which still governs mining on federal lands — even foreign companies don’t have to pay royalties to the American people for the riches they haul away. Yet we are responsible in the long term for the damage.


  Excellon speaks of Kilgore as “the next Round Mountain.” This refers to a gold mine, owned by Canada’s Kinross Gold, some 50 miles north of Tonopah, in the Nevada desert. Its pit is 1,600 acres, the equivalent of about 1,200 football fields.


  Round Mountain Mine, however, receives little precipitation, while the Centennials’ snow, streams and groundwater sustain our farms, wildlife refuges and wildlife management areas. Camas Creek flows from lush Camas Meadows to Camas National Wildlife Area, into Mud Lake Wildlife Management Area and farmlands, and into the aquifer.


  In July, the Kilgore Project will enter the second season of its five-year exploratory permit from the U.S. Forest Service. Currently, the Idaho Conservation League, Greater Yellowstone Coalition and Advocates for the West are challenging the permit in U.S. District Court in Boise. The issue is not responsible mining in appropriate places. The issue is mining here, in this way — an issue that ultimately may be tried in the court of public opinion.

Despite being closed to the public the staff of the Lawton Public Library are working hard to continue to provide the community with the resources it needs during these uncertain times. In addition to their everyday duties, the staff have also stepped up to provide local businesses with critical information in regard to the city’s changing policies during this state of civil emergency.
 Kristin Herr is the Director of the Lawton Public Library and has held that position since May 2012. On the 8th day of the library’s closure she and her staff were busy answering phone calls, making curbside book deliveries, cleaning and doing the kind of in-depth maintenance they don’t typically have the time to do.
 “The biggest thing we are trying to do right now is answer the phones and help people the best we can,” Herr said. “We know there are a lot of people stuck at home right now—a lot of kids stuck at home right now—so we are just trying to get them as many services right now as possible.”
 Among those services are a wealth of e-resources available to any resident with a library card. These resources include at least two dozen databases that provide access to everything from online language learning tools to the online check out of digital movies.
 “We actually just increased our database listings. We have six new resources that are now available,” Herr said. “There are also a lot of vendors that are making their stuff free right now, so we are listing those on that database page as well.”
 Meanwhile, with the library limited to staff only, the need for quiet has also been diminished. This means renovations to the library’s bathroom facilities can operate at will without worrying about disturbing the usual peace and serenity associated with the library.
 “They are able to make all of their loud noises while we are closed,” Herr said, over the din of a buzz saw from the library’s lobby. “The goal is to have all of the loud noises done before the people come back.”
 There are also several activities that typically take a lower priority during regular hours that the staff have been able to catch-up on such as cleaning, shifting shelves and updating computers.
 “There is a lot of maintenance stuff we are getting done right now,” Herr said.
 Despite the workload, there are, of course, things the staff is unable to do right now that they would have been working on.
 “We were expecting to do a lot more with the census,” Herr said. “Helping people fill out their census is something we can’t do right now. But we can at least continue to advocate for filling it out. We always help people with their taxes with our volunteer tax preparers, and we can’t do that right now, either.”
 But make no mistake, those duties haven’t left the staff wanting. If anything, they are staying even busier by helping with the City of Lawton’s response to the ongoing civil emergency. Tiffany Martinez Vrska, Community Relations Director for the City of Lawton, said the city is grateful for the staff at the library and their assistance.
 “The staff here has been crucial in helping us get information out from the Mayor and City Manager’s offices,” Vrska said. “With so many changes being implemented so quickly their crew has stepped up to help us reach out to the community. They’ve done phone trees for us and made sure the businesses that were affected are notified in a timely manner. They’ve been so very helpful in helping us navigate our way through this.”
 While the library staff have taken on new roles in light of the current situation, they still haven’t forgotten their original role—getting books into the hands of the public. And while no one can come in the library to check out a book, books can still be ordered by phone and picked up outside of the library where a staff member will bring them out to patrons.
 Not being open to the public hurts, according to Herr. The modern library is, after all, more of a community center than anything else. But Herr said the American Library association itself was encouraging libraries to close down during the pandemic for this very reason.
 “We serve about 200,000 people a year. We are a high traffic area. So, closing us off does reduce the spread and the traffic and I think that is why communities were so quick to shut down libraries,” Herr said.
 Community members are encouraged to call the Lawton Public Library for assistance, Herr said. Staff members are prepared to help in any way they can, and if they can’t, they might be able to point callers to someone that can.
 Like everyone right now, the library staff are burdened with anxiety. But Herr said they are finding moments of levity in the darkness.
 “We are working hard. I think it’s important for any business to let off a little bit of steam,” Herr said. “So last Friday we did a pajama day and this Friday we are having a superhero day. And there may have been a few line dances.”

DHS announced last week that Oregonians statewide now can use their SNAP benefits online to buy groceries at Amazon or Wal-Mart, which support the physical distancing required by Governor Brown's Stay Home Save Lives Executive Order. In addition, DHS is not requiring interviews for those who report having no household income. Oregonians can apply for SNAP without visiting a DHS office. Applications are available online at OHP.Oregon.gov.
 “Whether you’re experiencing job loss for the first time, or you’ve been struggling to make ends meet for a while, we want you to know about all the options open to you,” said Susannah Morgan, Oregon Food Bank CEO. “SNAP food assistance is our region’s most effective defense against hunger — especially in times of crisis. It’s an important resource that can feed families and help prevent hunger from becoming yet another symptom of COV-19.”
 SNAP is a federally funded program that offers nutrition assistance to low- income individuals and families. SNAP is the largest program in the domestic hunger safety net. In Oregon, individuals and families apply for SNAP benefits at Department of Human Services (DHS) and Area Agency on Aging (AAA) offices across the state.

KINGSTON - With senior Chase Perkins reaching the All-State tournament, the Silver Lake wrestling team enjoyed its finest season in school history. The Lakers finished 17-10 in dual meet competition, and Perkins was one of three wrestlers selected to the Patriot League All-Star team.
 "This is the best record the team had dual meet-wise since the high school split into Pembroke and Silver Lake," head coach Wayne Reissfelder said.
 Perkins, competing at 160 pounds, advanced to the All-States by finishing fourth in both the Division 2 South Sectionals and the Div. 2 state meet. He had 34 wins, including one of the team's biggest of the season, pulling an upset in a match against Whitman-Hanson that was the difference in a 42-40 victory.
 "He was quite a surprise for us," Reissfelder said. "We knew he had potential, and he really put in the work in the weight room and the wrestling room."
 Junior Kyle Cipullo won 30 matches and also earned a spot on the league all- stars after advancing to the sectional finals at 220 pounds.
 "We expected him to be one of the better wrestlers on the South Shore," Reissfelder said. "In the sectionals, he ran into a kid from Plymouth North (AJ Dias) who ended up second in the states. But he was a big part of why we were 17-10."
 Junior Scott Snell, 18-8 competing mostly at 106, was also honored, even though he was unable to compete in the postseason due to a broken nose.
 "Even with that, and even though all-stars are often determined by postseason success, the coaches put him in because they were well aware of his body of work over the season," Reissfelder said.
 The Lakers also received contributions from a number of other wrestlers. Senior William Barkowski was undefeated in the dual meet season at 152 pounds, went 19-4 overall and finished fourth at the sectionals. Senior Michael Voci, with 23 wins wrestling at 195, also took fourth at sectionals, as did junior Cam Turner, who had 21 wins at 170.
 Seniors Pat Ganley, who collected 20 wins at 126, and Will Hesketh, who split time between 220 and heavyweight, provided additional depth.
 Junior Geoff Cook played an instrumental role, wrestling at 182, nearly 20 pounds above his weight, which allowed the Lakers to fill out their lineup.
 Freshman Sydney Diauto became the first Silver Lake girl to wrestle in the state tournament, competing at 106. She went 2-2 in the girls division.

The Senegal international is a dominant defender, averaging significantly more successful duels per 90 minutes (8.22) than Lindelof (6.47) and Maguire (7.05).
 Koulibaly also excels in the air, winning 3.72 aerial duels per 90 minutes, more than Lindelof has averaged this season (3.48).
 He has power and pace that allows him to keep up with the quickest of attackers and also enables him to drop the ball out of defence to kick start attacks from the back.
 Going forward, stats suggest the Napoli star would be the ideal partner for Maguire thanks to his ability on the ball.
 Koulibaly has averaged 27.81 forward passes per game this season, again, more than both Maguire (19.2) and Lindelof (21.6).
 One might argue the Serie A is played at a much lower tempo than the Premier League which gives Koulibaly more time on the ball to pick out a forward pass.
 Nevertheless, even at Anfield under the high press of Liverpool, he managed to complete 10 out of 13 of his forward passes during the 1-1 draw, suggesting he is well equipped to deal with life in England.

During the Great Recession, by some estimates close to 200,000 small businesses shut down. Most of them died a slow death, with the consequences — layoffs, reduced investment and expansion — occurring gradually. By contrast, the suddenness of the virus-related economic shutdown is threatening to quickly destroy even healthy restaurants, retailers and other companies almost without warning.
 Katie Vliestra, an executive at the National Association for the Self- Employed, an advocacy group, says she's concerned about the lag time between application and approval for even the small loans that are intended to have the fastest turnaround. Most small companies have only 15 to 30 days of cash on hand, she said.
 There are also worries about potential logjams at the SBA. The agency's inspector general's office found that the SBA failed to quickly turn around thousands of loans after Hurricane Harvey devastated the Houston area in 2017. (The SBA didn't immediately respond to a request for information about handling an influx of applications.)
 John Arensmeyer, CEO of the advocacy group Small Business Majority, says he's concerned that the loans will be processed through the SBA's traditional business loan program, which relies on banks to handle the initial applications.
 "Banks have to retool their technology to do this," Arensmeyer says. "It's going to be months before this money gets out there. How many people are going to be able to maintain payroll, hoping to get this money?"
 On its face, at least, the rescue aid appears to address some of the most vital needs of small businesses, notably their ability to maintain or hire back furloughed workers eventually. The issue is whether it will come quickly enough.
 "The challenge is cash flow," says Jason Duff, owner of Six Hundred Downtown, a restaurant in Bellefontaine, Ohio. He has a staff of eight, down from 27, handling deliveries and pickups. "We need money now for us to be able to make those payrolls as people come back."
 Duff has less than a week of working capital funds available. He is seeking loans from family and friends as well as some patience from vendors while he awaits federal help.
 Don Allison has bills coming due this week for his business, a publisher of books about the Civil War and northwest Ohio history. He and his wife are looking forward to a combined $2,400. But the royalty checks he must send out require a bigger cash infusion. And he's concerned about being in a long line of owners hoping to receive SBA loans.
 "They're going to be slammed," Allison says of the SBA. "How big a delay is there going to be?"
 Loans are at least a short-term need for many business owners. But they aren't a solution for others that have been reluctant to take on more debt after the Great Recession. Liliana Aranda, for example, who owns a now-closed skin care business, doesn't want a loan that will burden her with debt payments — especially since she doesn't know yet how much the outbreak will affect consumer spending. She already carries a small amount of debt.
 The same is true for Susin Greenberg, a freelance hair and fashion stylist.
 "Anytime I'm thinking of loans, I'm thinking I have to make money to pay it back in the long run," says Greenberg, who lives in Highland Park, Illinois. She's focusing on other forms of financial aid in the rescue package but worries about how long it would take to arrive.
 "We're having to live though the wait," she says.

Hi, Jonas. Thanks for the questions. First one have to do, I believe, with how much of our portfolio is impacted and affected by the crisis and how does that correlate with the measures that are currently being discussed. On Page 21, this is the work that has been done to identify the sectors and the areas that are mostly and most immediately affected by the crisis. You are seeing that on the business level, we have identified something approximately around €10 billion, something under €10 billion that are severely and moderately affected, of which €5 billion are the severely for affected sectors. This access has been done in conjunction and taking into account the Ministry of Finance classification, of course. And we have also modeled the level of redemption and servicing that is required. I can tell you that this is in the vicinity of €300 million of capital redemption I expect for the year. And approximately the same amount is for interest. So pretty much in conjunction with what has been announced and within the levels of the government initiatives. As far as your question on new loans, this is where I can tell you that we have already dispersed. We are quite on track with €5 billion aspiration that we had mentioned in previous communications. Quarter-to-date, we are already at the €1 billion, so pretty much on track with what we are doing the effect that the crisis will have on that is a bit as you can understand up for grabs and we are monitoring the situation and looking forward.

But more and more laptops are sporting 144Hz screens now, and there's talk that 200Hz, 240Hz and more might be on the way.

LONDON/NEW YORK -- Global mergers and acquisitions activity plunged 28% in the first quarter to its lowest level since 2016 as the devastating economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, compounding a slow start to the year for dealmakers.
 Deal activity in the United States dropped by half to $252 billion in the first three months from a year ago, driving global volumes down to $698 billion from $964 billion in the first quarter of 2019, according to Refinitiv data. Asia volumes dropped 17% year-on-year to $142.9 billion.
 Europe saw its deal volume more than double to $232 billion thanks to a handful of mega-deals clinched just weeks before the virus started battering the continent's economies.
 With large swathes of the globe shut down, the M&A pipeline remains patchy and likely to be dominated by rescue deals, restructurings and nationalizations as governments and central banks try to shore the economy up.
 "This crisis is unique. It is something that our generation has never witnessed before," said Luigi de Vecchi, chairman of EMEA banking capital markets advisory at Citigroup.
 "When stock markets tumble 30% you need to hope to renegotiate a deal if you have the contractual ability to do so. However, if you haven't reached an agreement you are likely to delay the signing until you have better visibility," he said.
 Russia used its National Wealth Fund (NWF) to finance this quarter's biggest deal - the $39 billion purchase of the country's largest lender Sberbank.
 Other big deals included insurance broker Aon's $30 billion all-stock takeover of rival Willis Towers Watson and the $18 billion private equity-led buyout of Thyssenkrupp's elevators business.
 "We have seen the number of deals announced globally drop 43% year-over-year in the last two weeks," said Bank of America's global M&A head Patrick Ramsey, adding the downward trend was expected to continue into the second quarter.
 "Once we get to the back-end of this, we will see a meaningful snap-back in activity. The degree of that snap-back will depend on the economic outlook and equity market recovery," Ramsey said.
 STATE INTERVENTION
 The U.S. Federal Reserve and its global counterparts moved aggressively this month to introduce emergency rate cuts aimed at restoring investor confidence.
 "If market turmoil and volatility persist, we will see a polarization between companies in more resilient sectors which can better withstand this crisis, and distressed players in the worst-affected sectors which will be starving for cash," said Paulo Pereira, a founding partner at Perella Weinberg Partners.
 Pereira added that a rebound in M&A activity will hinge on whether distressed companies will have a "material destabilizing impact" on other sectors, including financial services.
 "Inevitably there will be some impact because economic activity is interlinked," Pereira said. "But the financial system is now better capitalized than in 2008 and the actions of governments and central banks will be key in determining the ability of the economy to rebound," he said.
 Dealmakers expect more political intervention to save companies of strategic national interest.
 "There will be rescue deals and there will be many of them," de Vecchi said.
 "You will see a return of state intervention, triggered not only by protectionist moves to deter unwanted takeovers but by the sheer necessity to rescue entire industries, revive strategic assets and, where possible, create domestic champions through consolidation," he said.
 The bleak outlook has proved a boon for investment banks to whom clients have turned for advice on how to weather the storm.
 "Periods of turmoil underscore the value of a trusted adviser and a global platform that spans not only M&A but also restructuring and sovereign advisory," said Peter Orszag, Lazard CEO of financial advisory.
 "We remain active advising clients as they navigate the drivers of how long the crisis will last, how they should adjust their balance sheets, and what else they should be doing to respond," Orszag said.
 Investment banks face tough decisions on whether to approve potentially risky loans in order to stay close to their clients, hoping to win mandates when dealmaking picks up again.
 "This is the moment when your clients are coming to you to ask for financing and not just for advice. Supporting your clients in these difficult times is a test of loyalty that can prove vital for a long-term relationship," de Vecchi said.

He always greeted strangers walking past him with a chipper 'Good Morning!' and a big smile. He had a great laugh that filled the room with joy. My mom is also fighting COVID-19. For the time being, she has not required hospitalization. The loss of my stepfather is devastating but what has gutted me is that this pandemic has kept my family apart. We were unable to be with him during his last days. I can't hold my mother as she mourns her husband. I can't hug my brother as he contemplates a world without his father. I can't wipe away the tears from my nephews' eyes as they wonder why their Lolo Sonny isn't here anymore. I want to thank everyone of you who offered up prayers, love and assistance to our family during this difficult time. Please continue to pray and send healing energy to my mom.

The production schedule considers the processing of material by ROM, HPGR and toll processing. HPGR stockpiles of lower-grade material will be utilized to ensure that higher-grade material is processed first. The stockpiles will be maintained near the crusher. All ROM material will be dumped in place directly on the ROM leach pad. Monthly periods were used to create the production schedule with pre-stripping starting at the Dark Star Deposit at Month -8. Start of ROM processing is assumed to be Month 1. HPGR processing is started three years after the start of ROM processing. Prior to that time, the ROM material will be processed up to the maximum spray capacity of 22,500 tonnes per day of material or up to 8.2 million tonnes per year. Once HPGR processing starts, the maximum HPGR rate is targeted at 10,000 tonnes per day or 3,650,000 tonnes per year on a 365 day per year basis and ROM processing is reduced as to not exceed the total spray processing available.

Nancy Outland Chandler age 95, retired real estate company founder, died on March 27, 2020 with her family by her side, having lived a rich and full life. Nancy was the widow of Webster Monroe Chandler, Jr and the third daughter of the late Lida Maddox Outland of Snow Hill, MD and the late Grover Cleveland Outland of Isle of Wight County, VA. Nancy was born in South Norfolk on June 11, 1924 and grew up in the Berkley and Larchmont neighborhoods of the city. She graduated from Miss Preston's School of Dance during her teenage years, which gave her a lifelong love of the dance and armed her with Miss Preston's life lessons. A 1942 honor graduate of Maury High School, she went on to attend the Norfolk Division of the College of William and Mary and graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1945, where she was a member of the College Choir and College Quartet, Chi Omega Sorority, and President of Kappa Delta Pi Honor Society in Education. She taught mathematics at Blair Junior High School for three years until she married her high school sweetheart and love of her life, Web.      For over 64 years, Nancy and Web built a wonderful life together in Norfolk, centered on family, faith, and service. She especially loved family time spent at Virginia Beach's North End and Sandbridge, and at the Coast Guard Station at Cedar Island on the Eastern Shore.      A proud 13th generation Virginian, Nancy's roots stem from early 17th century Isle of Wight County. She was a member of the Suffolk Chapter, Virginia Society Colonial Dames of the XVII Century and the Tidewater Regents Chapter of the National Society, Daughters of the American Revolution.      For the first 21 years of her marriage, Nancy served the community she so loved in many ways. She was a Brownie, Girl Scout, and Cub Scout Troop Leader. She made newborn hats and booties and assembled newborn baskets for the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul. She edited the 1974 cookbook-- Favorite Recipes of the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd, was a docent at the Norfolk Museum of Arts and Sciences, and Chair of the Friends of the Library of the Chrysler Museum of Art. She was a devoted Virginia Military Institute alumnus wife and supporter and an enthusiastic Rotary Ann.      Nancy earned her real estate license in 1969 and started work as a part-time agent. Bestowed with her legendary charm, determination, and strong work ethic, she founded Nancy Chandler Associates in 1974. Nancy was a woman ahead of her time in business and a true pioneer in the local real estate industry. She built her customer-focused company on hard work, integrity and a passion for people, as exemplified by her well-known business moniker â€""We Get People and Places Together." In the late 1960s and 1970s, she bucked discriminatory housing practices by showing properties in such neighborhoods as Colonial Place and Ghent to all clients regardless of race. She grew her business to be the number one real estate office in Norfolk in the 1980s and it remained so for more than 30 years. Her indomitable spirit and wisdom graced many from all avenues of life whom she mentored throughout her career.      She was the first woman member of The Norfolk Rotary Club. She was a member of the Board of Directors of Heritage Bank, the Board of Trustees of Westminster Canterbury on Chesapeake Bay, and President of the Board of Trustees of The Ballentine. Nancy served on the Vestry of the Church of the Good Shepherd, where she was a longstanding member.      Nancy's greatest joy came from her large and beloved family. She is survived by her daughter, Nancy Deal Chandler and her husband Paul Pomplun of Suffolk, VA; her son, Webster Monroe Chandler III and his wife Lisa Smith Chandler of Norfolk, VA; and her son, John Maddox Chandler and his wife Charlotte Webb Chandler of Norfolk. She adored her five wonderful granddaughters, Whitney Deal Chandler of Norfolk, Brynn Chandler Noel of San Francisco, CA and her husband William Hayes Noel, and Jane Carter Chandler, Virginia Maddox Chandler, and Nancy Webb Chandler of Norfolk, and a great granddaughter, Evelyn Monroe Noel of San Francisco. She deeply treasured her extended family of nieces, nephews, and dear friends.      Nancy deemed every member of her family as "amazing" and "exceptional." She especially liked to do this one-on-one, making each and every one feel special, unique, and loved. Nancy held a broad interpretation of "family" and was prone to include many of her acquaintances and colleagues---her intention always being to uplift them. There will never be another soul like her in any way, and anecdotes about her will be told and retold for years to come.      She was also predeceased by her son William Outland Chandler, her sisters Louise Outland Smith and Jean Outland Chrysler, their husbands Col. (USMC Ret.) John Lucian Smith and Walter Percy Chrysler Jr, and her brother Grover Cleveland Outland Jr and his wife Margaret "Teancy" Mathews Outland.      The family would like to thank the loving and dedicated staff of angels at Commonwealth Senior Living-The Ballentine, especially those in the Memory Care Unit, and Nancy's devoted friend and caregiver of many years, Margaret Keys. Your kindness and love will never be forgotten.      A private family graveside funeral service will be held at Elmwood Cemetery with the Reverend James Medley officiating. Once the restrictions around the COVID-19 virus have been lifted, a celebration of Nancy's life with a reception to follow will be announced. Memorial donations may be made to the Church of the Good Shepherd, 7400 Hampton Blvd. Norfolk, VA 23404 or a

Underfed and chained up for endless hours, campaigners warn many elephants working in Thailand's tourism sector may starve, be sold to zoos or shifted into the illegal logging trade as the coronavirus decimates visitor numbers.


  Before the virus, life for the kingdom's estimated 2,000 elephants working in tourism was already stressful, with abusive methods often used to 'break them' into giving rides and performing tricks at money-spinning animal shows.


  With global travel paralysed the animals are unable to pay their way, including the 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of food a day a captive elephant needs to survive.


  Elephant camps and conservationists warn hunger and the threat of renewed exploitation lie ahead, without an urgent bailout.


  "My boss is doing what he can but we have no money," Kosin, a mahout -- or elephant handler -- says of the Chiang Mai camp where his elephant Ekkasit is living on a restricted diet.


  Chiang Mai is Thailand's northern tourist hub, an area of rolling hills dotted by elephant camps and sanctuaries ranging from the exploitative to the humane.


  Footage sent to AFP from another camp in the area shows lines of elephants tethered by a foot to wooden poles, some visibly distressed, rocking their heads back and forth.


  Around 2,000 elephants are currently "unemployed" as the virus eviscerates Thailand's tourist industry, says Theerapat Trungprakan, president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association.


  The lack of cash is limiting the fibrous food available to the elephants "which will have a physical effect", he added.


  Wages for the mahouts who look after them have dropped by 70 percent.


  Theerapat fears the creatures could soon be used in illegal logging activities along the Thai-Myanmar border -- in breach of a 30-year-old law banning the use of elephants to transport wood.


  Others "could be forced (to beg) on the streets," he said.


  It is yet another twist in the saga of the exploitation of elephants, which animal rights campaigners have long been fighting to protect from the abusive tourism industry.


  \- 'Crisis point' -


  For those hawking a once-in-a-lifetime experience with the giant creatures -- whether from afar or up close -- the slump began in late January.


  Chinese visitors, who make up the majority of Thailand's 40 million tourists, plunged by more than 80 percent in February as China locked down cities hard- hit by the virus and banned external travel.


  By March, the travel restrictions into Thailand -- which has 1,388 confirmed cases of the virus -- had extended to Western countries.


  With elephants increasingly malnourished due to the loss of income, the situation is "at a crisis point," says Saengduean Chailert, owner of Elephant Nature Park.


  Her sanctuary for around 80 rescued pachyderms only allows visitors to observe the creatures, a philosophy at odds with venues that have them performing tricks and offering rides.


  She has organised a fund to feed elephants and help mahouts in almost 50 camps nationwide, fearing the only options will soon be limited to zoos, starvation or logging work.


  For those restrained by short chains all day, the stress could lead to fights breaking out, says Saengduean, of camps that can no longer afford medical treatment for the creatures.


  Calls are mounting for the government to fund stricken camps to ensure the welfare of elephants.


  "We need 1,000 baht a day (about $30) for each elephant," says Apichet Duangdee, who runs the Elephant Rescue Park.


  Freeing his eight mammals rescued from circuses and loggers into the forests is out of the question as they would likely be killed in territorial fights with wild elephants.


  He is planning to take out a two million baht ($61,000) loan soon to keep his elephants fed.


  "I will not abandon them," he added.

The strides made by the rotomolding powder market essentially rides on the back of the extensive demand for wide range of plastic products in consumer as well as industrial sectors across the world. The rising demand for myriad plastic products in emerging economies is bolstering the uptake of rotomolding powder. The rapidly rising use of rotomolding powder in numerous end-use applications such as the automotive, construction, and material handling is underpinning the steady expansion of the market. The rising consumer spending on water adventure events and the growing demand for recreational boats is a key factor catalyzing the use of rotomolding powder. The rising use of plastics made with rotomolding in recreational products is also boosting the market.

It is a pity there's no law in India like the Defence Production Act in the US empowering the President of the day to order industrial companies to drop whatever they are doing and diverting their production processes and lines to rolling out the specialized equipments, such as ventilators, required in crises. Thus, President Trump has instructed to General Electric to begin mass producing them. Without any such prompt from the Indian government, many large Indian firms, such as Mahindra, have taken the initiative to join forces with smaller health equipment manufacturers, to gear up its factories to output 10,000 ventilator units per week. Other companies too should now be encouraged by the Modi government to follow suit with inducements, such as promise to buy all ventilators so manufactured, because the demand for them is likely soon to spike and continue to remain at a high level. Unless the Indian industry in the private sector takes the lead, the C-virus will fell more Indians than any war or natural natural and manmade disaster the country has to-date faced, perhaps on the scale of the 2 to 3 million dead in the Great Bengal Famine that the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill so heartlessly engineered in 1943.

A way to escape from Swiss society
 The merchant marine used to stand high in the imaginary of restless youth like Ernst, explains Damian. They had limited prospects of careers and advancement beyond the rigid social life of their hometowns and valleys and found an alternative, freer life at sea.
 But this exhibition is not a straightforward historical retrospection. It doesn’t show concern for official narratives. Still, the original footage, enhanced by the display of a carefully-curated show of artworks and videos by contemporary artists such as Adnan Softic and the Swiss-Brazilian duo Dias & Riedwegexternal link, brings to the fore the importance of Switzerland as a trading power over the last centuries.
 The slave trade of the Americas, for one, used to be an activity to which Swiss companies, financiers and traders engaged wholeheartedly. Notwithstanding the Swiss political neutrality, some of its entrepreneurs profited immensely from business opportunities opened by the colonial powers, accumulating capital that still keeps the little Alpine nation as one of the leading players in the global economy.

Melbourne, Mar 31 (PTI) Australian cricketers might have to accept a pay cut due to the COVID-19 pandemic, conceded Test captain Tim Paine but insisted that making financial sacrifices is a "small thing" in the current situation and they are prepared to "do their bit".


  A pay cut for the top cricketers seems to be on the cards with Cricket Australia delaying annual contracts for both the men's and women's national teams. CA is preparing for the possibility of a severely-affected home summer due to the coronavirus outbreak.


  "Certainly discussions will start happening in the next week or so," Paine was quoted as saying by 'ESPNCricinfo'.


  "Certainly if things happen similar to what's happened to football and other sports, then we've certainly got to do our bit to make sure the game survives and remains really healthy for years to come.


  "If it comes to that, I'm sure that's something that the players will look at. But there are bigger issues going on around the world at the moment than how much our sportsmen are going to get paid. That'll be a small thing to us if that was to happen."


  Australia could have overtaken India in the World Test Championship ahead of the Border-Gavaskar series if Paine's side would have managed a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh in June but with the coronavirus outbreak forcing a cricket shutdown, the tour is now unlikely to go ahead.


  "You don't have to be Einstein to realise (the Bangladesh tour) is probably unlikely to go ahead, particularly in June. Whether it's cancelled or pushed back, we're not quite sure at the moment," Paine said.


  "Some series have been cancelled and whether ones going forward are going to be continually cancelled or we're going to postpone them (is uncertain) but it's a couple of Test matches and if at the end of the day we have to miss them, then so be it."


  There is a lot of uncertainty over the rescheduling of the international calender, especially with the World Test Championship final slated for June 2021.


  Paine said they are eager to make the decider and might need to play five successive weeks to complete the World Test Championship.


  "... maybe players are going to go through a period where we play five weeks' cricket (at a stretch) if we can to complete the Test championship. I think all players will be in favour of trying to finish that in any way we can.


  "But again if it doesn't happen as I said there are bigger issues in the world and missing a few Test matches isn't going to hurt us," he said.

Finally, as Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte famously said, "great empires die of indigestion." So is the fate of the Ethiopian Empire, a chronic nostalgia that some find hard to lay off. It is however important that everyone come to terms with the fact that the empire is dead and stop making the funeral more expensive than it should be. In its place, let this generation build a new Ethiopia in which basic human rights are respected and every one of its peoples have full say over their own economic, social and political affairs, and participate in the central government on fair, equal and balanced basis. That is among high aspirations of the famous Ethiopian student movement of the previous century which preceded the lofty call for freedom, equality, peace, democracy and self-determination. These are the very principles for which thousands of unarmed Qeerroo and others confronted tanks and paid the ultimate price with their precious lives. It would indeed be foolhardy not to take note that the acquiescence of the 1970s that led to Derg's seventeen-year military dictatorship and that of early 1990s which allowed TPLF oligarchy to flourish cannot be counted on today. We trust that the sacrifices and continued wakefulness of Qeerroo and their allies have put such eventuality to eternal rest. Let everyone focus on making the forthcoming elections fair and free which will be a prelude to a democratic and peaceful country that most compatriots envisage, and which can and should be a foremost guarantor for wholesome growth and prosperity that benefit everyone. //

The Livingston Pad is 1,320 feet from Anthem Ranch, an over-55 community, with an average age of 69. Many of those residents have reported respiratory problems. Based on experience we know flowback is the riskiest period of oil and gas drilling and completion. At the Interchange Pad air monitoring established increased volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, including concerning spikes. While we appreciate that Extraction’s closed-loop system is state of the art, our air quality expert Colorado State University’s Dr. Jeff Collet testified that VOCs emitted are still expected to be two times normal. We are in a national emergency, the burden shouldn’t be on Broomfield to prove increased emissions meet EPA or any other levels. Much has been made of our public health officer’s statement that increased mental stress decreases an individual’s ability to fight COVID-19. Think about it for a minute. The CDPHE issued a study documenting the health damages people experience within 2,000 feet of a drilling pad. Colorado passed SB 181 last year, giving local governments greater regulatory authority over oil and gas development. Council recently approved on first reading regulations limiting areas oil and gas operations can occur. The Livingston Pad, under those regulations would not be allowed. Surely, the fact that operations are allowed during unprecedented times increases the mental stress of impacted residents.

China’s subsequent response, once it decided to enact the full lockdown of Hubei and institute at least partial lockdowns of a population of over 750 million, has eventually proven effective at containing the virus. On March 19, China announced that it had no new domestically transmitted cases of novel coronavirus (though there is dispute over these numbers). China has now banned all foreigners from entering the country, regardless of residency status or visa class, as the greatest risk to the country is now imported cases.
 After essentially shuttering its economy for two months, closing everything from large-scale industrial factories to small bubble-tea shops, the Chinese economy is picking up again. A recent headline in _Xinhua_ , the state news agency, extolled the “roaring Chinese factories in full swing,”.
 After this reversal of fortune China has gone on a PR and propaganda offensive, celebrating its success as the rest of the world is descending into chaos trying to fight off the virus. So far China has provided assistance to 89 countries and four international organisations to fight against the novel coronavirus, according to the China International Development Cooperation Agency.

Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. Three questions please. First of all, with regards to cost of risk for 2020 I do appreciate that it’s probably a bit early to provide us with guidance but I just wanted to see your – to hear your thoughts on how cost of risk is going to progress in the next few quarters. And especially, is there going to be an automatic update of cost of risk on the back of the IFRS 9 model update, because now I suspect all banks will have to introduce harsher macro scenarios? So when should we expect you to update your model? Is that going to be in Q1 or will you wait for some ECB guidelines on this and so we won’t really see anything until Q2? And then if you could also give us some guidance sort of some broader thoughts on how do you see the corporate book that you have, how post those liquidity support measures, is there any risk that some of the corporates may not be able to make it? And then second question on your NPE book, how should we think about provisions there? Does the fact that the macro environment has deteriorated a lot imply that you now need to increase your coverage in your exposure? And third question, with regards to the RWAs and you had previously communicated that you are constantly looking to optimize your RWAs relative to your credit exposures and you had announced earlier this year a shipping partnership. So I am wondering if there is more to be done potentially that could mitigate somewhat a potential increase in credit risk? Thank you very much.

A pay cut for the top cricketers seems to be on the cards with Cricket Australia delaying annual contracts for both the men's and women's national teams. CA is preparing for the possibility of a severely-affected home summer due to the coronavirus outbreak.      "Certainly discussions will start happening in the next week or so," Paine was quoted as saying by _ESPNCricinfo_.      "Certainly if things happen similar to what's happened to football and other sports, then we've certainly got to do our bit to make sure the game survives and remains really healthy for years to come.      "If it comes to that, I'm sure that's something that the players will look at. But there are bigger issues going on around the world at the moment than how much our sportsmen are going to get paid. That'll be a small thing to us if that was to happen."      Australia could have overtaken India in the World Test Championship ahead of the Border-Gavaskar series if Paine's side would have managed a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh in June but with the coronavirus outbreak forcing a cricket shutdown, the tour is now unlikely to go ahead.      "You don't have to be Einstein to realise ( _the Bangladesh tour_ ) is probably unlikely to go ahead, particularly in June. Whether it's cancelled or pushed back, we're not quite sure at the moment," Paine said.      "Some series have been cancelled and whether ones going forward are going to be continually cancelled or we're going to postpone them (is uncertain) but it's a couple of Test matches and if at the end of the day we have to miss them, then so be it."

The statement said Pompeo's comments "seriously impaired the signboard of dialogue put up by the U.S. president as a decoy to buy time and create the environment favorable for himself." It referred to a recent personal letter that President Donald Trump sent to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which North Korea said was aimed at maintaining good relations and offering cooperation in fighting the coronavirus pandemic.
 The statement did not say what action North Korea would take. But it said it would be designed to repay the U.S. for suffering it has inflicted on North Korea, in an apparent reference to U.S.-led sanctions that the North says have stifled its economy.

Eccles was originally named Lady Freckles but her name was swiftly changed to Eccles as young Amy Barlow couldn't pronounce the name.
 Ken's walks with Eccles landed him in hot water when, along the towpath of Weatherfield Canal in 2009, she jumped into the canal when chasing ducks and was rescued by Martha Fraser.
 Ken ended up having an affair with the actress who lived on a barge and he used his walks with Eccles as an excuse to get out of the house to meet Martha behind his wife Deirdre's back.

The poaching was first announced by Oregon State Police (OSP) in late January. A severed ear and damaged GPS collar were all that were found after the bighorn sheep was poached near Troy. The GPS collar transmitted that the animal had died on Sunday, Jan. 26.
 The severed ear, which has an identification tag, is from an adult ram. The GPS tracking collar, which was programmed to indicate mortality if it didn’t move for nine hours, had been cut loose from around the animal’s neck. Both were found lying on the ground near a feeding station. Forensics evidence indicates the animal was shot, according to Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife Sergeant Chris Hawkins.

Another idea favored by those who want to get the economy moving quickly is to apply different prevention measures to urban and rural areas. Although COVID-19 has been detected in every state, it’s most prevalent in large metropolitan areas such as New York, Seattle and Los Angeles. With that in mind, some people have suggested allowing less densely populated areas with no sign of the novel coronavirus to return to business as usual, leaving the hard-hit cities under lockdown.
 Yet that ignores how mobile and interconnected Americans have become, as exemplified by COVID-19’s rapid march through small towns in upstate New York. There are few restrictions on travel within the United States, and people are carrying the virus out of New York City and other hotbeds every day.
 There’s no better illustration of the futility of this approach than Italy, where infections and deaths continued to skyrocket after the government imposed controls only in 15 stricken northern provinces. If anything, Italy’s experience argues for governors in the United States to impose a uniform set of social distancing mandates across all 50 states and eliminate the gaps that help the disease spread. (Trump doesn’t have the authority to impose or lift restrictions around the country; that’s a local prerogative.)
 For the moment we’re stuck with blunt instruments such as California’s “stay home” mandate. If we really want to start getting back to normal, we would need to know who has the disease and where they are, which means testing everyone regardless of symptoms on a regular basis; checking the temperature of people as they enter offices, apartments and stores; rapidly isolating those who show signs of the disease; and providing protective equipment not just to first responders and health care workers, but also to every person who ventures out in public.
 With the stakes as high as they are, it would be foolish to lift the social distancing rules until we know much, much more about where the virus is lurking. Otherwise, we’d just be planting the seeds for a more widespread problem that overwhelms the health care system, drives up the death toll and costs the economy more in the long term.
 Congress is trying to buy us all some time with a massive infusion of cash to help businesses and workers survive the coronavirus meltdown. We need to stay focused on detecting the disease and limiting its spread, at least until there are effective treatments available. That means more testing, more monitoring and less guessing. Too many lives are at stake.

“We’re going to be continuing what we were doing from the get-go,” he said. “We were one of the few schools across the state that decided not to sit back and wait and continue our educational services.”
 Lepley said the district has not ruled out events such as graduation but is waiting for guidance from the state Department of Education on what the future holds for these events.
 “We’re going to keep it on the schedule and hope for the best for now,” he said. “If we’re not back to school, we’ll try to figure something out to recognize our seniors.”
 On Friday, Wolf signed legislation that waived the 180-day state mandate. The legislation, which was unanimously passed by the Legislature, also ensures school employees will be paid and increases the number of flexible instruction days.
 Many school officials said they will be continuing services, such as school lunch programs, while the schools are closed.
 “I know from our end the safety and well-being of our students is most important,” Turkeyfoot Principal Nicole Dice said. “So if this is what the governor feels is necessary for the health of our students, then we’ll do everything on our end to provide the continuity of education that the state is expecting from us.”
 Dice, who is set to become the district’s superintendent in June, said teachers have been communicating with families multiple times a week, regardless of whether they have the technology necessary for online learning.
 “The students can provide that feedback for that work for the teacher on the phone, or if they do have the ability of technology, for conferences and things like that,” she said.
 Superintendents said all of the school districts are in the same boat and are appreciative of staff members, teachers and residents who are trying to keep up with the constant changes.
 “You have to adjust on the fly, and I think our crew and community do a pretty good job of doing so,” Lepley said.

PLYMOUTH - When Troy Perry accepted Marc Loranger's invitation to compete in a middle school wrestling tournament nearly 25 years ago, he had no idea how much saying yes would change his life.


  Loranger, then at the start of his long and successful tenure as the Plymouth South wrestling coach, had heard about this tough, but troubled eighth-grader and was looking to recruit him for the program. Perry just figured he'd show up and kick some butt.


  Both got what they wanted.


  Perry, who had never been on a mat, dominated his opponents on the way to finishing first while Loranger would add a cornerstone wrestler to his program who went on to become a New England champion.


  "He absolutely destroyed kids that day," Loranger said. "I thought to myself, 'Oh, my God, he's going to be special.'"


  Earlier this month, Perry's wrestling career came full circle when he was inducted into the Massachusetts High School Wrestling Hall of Fame, where Loranger was in attendance, along with Perry's wife, Laura, and his two sons; August, 3, and Sebastian, 18-months-old.


  "It was surprising how emotional it was," Perry said. "My wife and boys got to see me on stage receiving an award for something they were never part of. It was really cool to introduce my family to what I would call my previous life."


  Today, Perry, 38, is co-owner of Home Perfection, a construction company specializing in remodels. He also invests in real estate. In both business ventures, his partners are former Plymouth South wrestlers; Jacob Decelle with the construction company, and Vinny Renault, a two-time New England champion, with the real estate.


  It's difficult to overstate how wrestling shaped Perry. Before discovering the sport, he was the definition of a troubled teen; skipping school, bucking authority, even spending time locked up.


  "I basically didn't attend sixth, seventh and eighth grade," he said. "In my freshman year of high school, I got zeros in every class. I failed everything. I was a know-it-all stupid teenager … I thought I had it all figured out. I was a tough-minded jerk."


  Perry said wrestling provided the challenge and structure he needed at that time. "It was probably the first time I felt like I was doing something I could excel at," he said.


  After freshman year, Perry poured his cockiness and willpower into wrestling and his schoolwork. "He told me after his freshman year that he was going to wrestle for me the next year, and that he was also going to make the National Honor Roll," Loranger said. "He just figured out he didn't want to be a knucklehead anymore."


  "I saw myself creating a path through wrestling," Perry said. "I made up my mind I wanted to make a change. It wasn't going to happen overnight. I was in it deep."


  Loranger helped Perry push through, and Perry has never forgotten how Loranger influenced him.


  "He had a way with me that made me want to push myself more than I ever would have on my own," he said. "He was the type of motivator that would make you want to run through a brick wall. He has always been more than just a coach and administrator. He has been able to reach kids that most people don't care to reach or simply don't know what to do with, and give them a path. He is a great man."


  On the mat in his sophomore season, Perry advanced to the 1998 Division 1 state finals wrestling at 130 pounds, where he lost to a three-time state champion by one point.


  "After the match, the kid who won told me, 'That kid is going to be incredible,'" Loranger recalled. "From there, Troy exploded and won everything the next year."


  Loranger remembers Perry's toughness and strength as a wrestler, and also his balance. "He had balance like I'd never seen, and he was so strong. He was a natural," he said.


  Perry credits his mindset for his success. "I wasn't necessarily the most skilled wrestler; it was my mentality," he said. "I never had it in me to quit or give up in a match."


  In 1999, as a junior, Perry captured the Div. 1 South sectionals, Div. 1 states, All-States and New Englands. He was ranked 19th in the country by USA Wrestling. Loranger remembers a moment near the end of the New England final that defined Perry. He was leading 2-0 in the middle of the second period when there was a stoppage in the match.


  "Troy comes running across the mat, jumps into my arms and says, "Coach, I just won a New England title,'" Loranger said. "I'm like, 'What are you talking about? The match isn't over.' He says, "You don't understand. I took him down. I already scored. There's no way he can score on me.'"


  Perry laughs now at the memory. "I knew it was over," he says. "In my mind, there was no way he could score on me. It just wasn't happening."


  Perry's wrestling career peaked at that moment as injuries derailed his final year of eligibility. But he had forever changed. As predicted, he also became a National Honor Roll student in his junior year.


  "Wrestling is such a difficult sport," Perry says, reflecting back. "It takes so much self-control, a lot of foresight, planning and discipline, all those things I wasn't using in my day-to-day life. Wrestling created structure and focused my attention and energy. It changed the trajectory of my life."

With coronavirus halting all other duties for the time being, Kitrosser told _PB Monthly_ the only way volunteers can continue their RSVP work is by conducting YANA checks via phone calls.


  The program currently has six elderly community members in need, so six RSVP members were assigned an individual to call on the days they would usually be visited.


  On the afternoon of March 2, _PB Monthly_ went on a ride-along with Kitrosser and Johnson to visit one of Northern Division’s favorite YANAs. 103-year-old Vivian has been in the program for more than a decade.


  “These guys have been so faithful to come and visit me for — what, 15 or 20 years?” she mused. “They will thread my needle (for sewing projects) and clean my vacuum cleaner. They go overboard to be caring and loving and attentive. Oh yes, they’re a _fine_ bunch of people.”

In the Fidelity Multi Asset Open range, we continue to focus on the defensive shape of the funds in light of the major intraday moves we have been seeing. Gold remains a core anchor in this regard, with exposure to both gold mining companies and physical gold, with a bias towards the latter, which is less volatile. While gold has declined at times of peak volatility during March, we attribute this to technical factors, and our thesis we believe is still positive on the asset over the medium term. In addition, we have reduced our tilt towards emerging markets as the onset of the virus is only recently making its presence felt in these regions, namely Latin America and Africa.

Hampering these efforts has been a Twitter mud-slinging match between the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the US president over the origin of the virus. Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese MFA,tweeted out a conspiracy theory that had been doing the rounds in China according to which the virus was first spread by an American soldier travelling on Wuhan’s underground. The tweet was shared in various forms by other accounts affiliated with the MFA, and further spread by Chinese state media. The claims received widespread international condemnation and had to be walked back a few days later by the Chinese ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai. The claim was “crazy”, he said, when pressed in an interview with Axios on HBO.
 Trump, who has consistently referred to Covid-19 as the “Chinese virus” doubled down on the use of the term in response to the baseless claims made by Zhao, refusing to moderate his language even after it was brought to his attention that doing so was putting Asian Americans at risk of racist attacks. “It’s not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that’s why. I want to be accurate,” Trump said.
 This political point-scoring over the origin of the virus is causing serious impediments to global cooperation to fight the disease. In recent days, talks among the UN Security Council nations over a joint declaration or resolution on the coronavirus have stalled over American insistence that it explicitly state that the virus originated in Wuhan, China, as well as exactly when it started there. China’s mission to the UN wrote that it was “astonished by the choice of the United States to use this opportunity for politicising the outbreak and blaming China, which we strongly oppose.” That same mission however was also seeking to have the language of the communique amended so that it praised China’s efforts to contain the virus.
 On a sub-national level, there has been encouraging solidarity. Jack Ma, China’s richest man and the founder of Alibaba group, has been instrumental in getting aid to developing countries. Through his charitable foundation he has already ensured that each of Africa’s 54 nations will receive 20,000 testing kits, 100,000 masks and 1,000 protective suits for medical use. Subverting the political sniping at the international level, he also managed to ship a million masks and half a million testing kits to the United States.
 “Jack is much more adept at soft power than the government. His life story is one of soft power, if you think about it. If soft power is all about charm, charisma, punching above your weight – Jack has that in spades,” says Duncan Clarke, author of the book _Alibaba: The House that Jack Built_.

Local churches are continuing to find novel ways to stay in touch with congregations and the community during a time of social distancing. On Sunday, Cornerstone Baptist Church hosted a drive-in church service that drew around 400 people.


  With sanctions in place to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic, most churches have stopped hosting services inside houses of worship. Cornerstone Pastor Chris Guffey said by phone Monday, churches are becoming more innovative in how they bring God’s Word to others.


  Sunday was the first drive-in service conducted by Cornerstone. Guffey said the idea occurred to him because he had pastor friends who’d previously hosted drive-in church services.


  “We thought we’d give it a try,” he added. “It’s a crazy time we’re living in and everybody is trying to be as creative as they can to keep people gathered, while still keeping everybody safe and healthy.”


  Those in attendance drove their cars, parked, stayed in the vehicles and listened to the service on 88.1 FM. The church, located on state Route Y west of Sedalia, also provided a Facebook Live event.


  “Basically, how it works is we put a trailer down at the bottom of the parking lot so we have theatre seating,” Guffey said. “Then, we ran all of our services into a soundboard that then projected it to two locations — Facebook Live and to an FM transmitter.”


  Church members directed traffic and also held signs telling worshipers to stay in their cars and tune into 88.1 FM.


  Guffey added the church also interacted with everyone in their cars by offering fun options for communication.


  “Since they’re all in their cars, I can’t hear them if they are talking to me,” he noted. “We can’t see them if they’re singing, so we gave them signs.”


  Participants could use their left blinker to signal they were raising their left hand in worship, if they turned on the parking lights it meant they were singing along and if they agreed with something they could honk their horns. Guffey added if they turned on the spray on their wipers it meant they wanted to be baptized.


  “All the feedback we’ve gotten has been really positive,” Guffey noted. “We had some new folks that came and aren’t connected to our church or any other church.


  “We have a few unique challenges, because we’re a little bit more rural than some of the other churches,” he continued. “But we got through those (challenges), and I thought it went really well.”


  Cornerstone will host the drive-in service again Sunday and Guffey said they hope to soon have other churches come on board.


  “We’re going to reach across denominational lines,” he noted.


  The church is inviting a representative from Bothwell Regional Health Center who will hopefully attend this Sunday’s drive-in service.


  “We’re going to request one person from Bothwell come (to the service) and we’re going to pray over the hospital and our nurses and doctors,” he said.


  Guffey added during this time of global pandemic many people need more than physical healing.


  “As believers, we believe that you treat the whole human condition,” he noted. “God made us body, mind and soul. And during this season we need to take care of our bodies but we also need to take care of our souls.


  “Every time we gather it’s not about an offering we received, but when we gather it’s an expression of our faith,” he continued. “It’s not about seeing friends or gathering in a social setting … our gathering No. 1, is to remind us that we serve our Savior and. No. 2 to point us to the eternal church.”


  He added in this uncertain time, everyone needs a “sense of calm” and when churches are closed people lose “that sense of calmness.”


  “That’s what our churches need to be doing right now is speaking calmness through a great God,” Guffey said.


  Weather permitting, Cornerstone Baptist Church, 19856 state Route Y, will host another drive-in church service at 10 a.m. Sunday, April 5. There is room for 230 cars. For more information, call 660-827-4833.

KINGSTON - With senior Chase Perkins reaching the All-State tournament, the Silver Lake wrestling team enjoyed its finest season in school history. The Lakers finished 17-10 in dual meet competition, and Perkins was one of three wrestlers selected to the Patriot League All-Star team.


  "This is the best record the team had dual meet-wise since the high school split into Pembroke and Silver Lake," head coach Wayne Reissfelder said.


  Perkins, competing at 160 pounds, advanced to the All-States by finishing fourth in both the Division 2 South Sectionals and the Div. 2 state meet. He had 34 wins, including one of the team's biggest of the season, pulling an upset in a match against Whitman-Hanson that was the difference in a 42-40 victory.


  "He was quite a surprise for us," Reissfelder said. "We knew he had potential, and he really put in the work in the weight room and the wrestling room."


  Junior Kyle Cipullo won 30 matches and also earned a spot on the league all- stars after advancing to the sectional finals at 220 pounds.


  "We expected him to be one of the better wrestlers on the South Shore," Reissfelder said. "In the sectionals, he ran into a kid from Plymouth North (AJ Dias) who ended up second in the states. But he was a big part of why we were 17-10."


  Junior Scott Snell, 18-8 competing mostly at 106, was also honored, even though he was unable to compete in the postseason due to a broken nose.


  "Even with that, and even though all-stars are often determined by postseason success, the coaches put him in because they were well aware of his body of work over the season," Reissfelder said.


  The Lakers also received contributions from a number of other wrestlers. Senior William Barkowski was undefeated in the dual meet season at 152 pounds, went 19-4 overall and finished fourth at the sectionals. Senior Michael Voci, with 23 wins wrestling at 195, also took fourth at sectionals, as did junior Cam Turner, who had 21 wins at 170.


  Seniors Pat Ganley, who collected 20 wins at 126, and Will Hesketh, who split time between 220 and heavyweight, provided additional depth.


  Junior Geoff Cook played an instrumental role, wrestling at 182, nearly 20 pounds above his weight, which allowed the Lakers to fill out their lineup.


  Freshman Sydney Diauto became the first Silver Lake girl to wrestle in the state tournament, competing at 106. She went 2-2 in the girls division.

Dubuque County’s largest employer has suspended production temporarily after learning that an employee there tested positive for COVID-19.
 John Deere Dubuque Works informed employees Sunday that the plant would be “temporarily shut down,” according to Director of Strategic Public Relations Jennifer Hartmann.
 She said the Dubuque plant ceased its normal production following the second shift on Friday, although some maintenance work took place Saturday.
 A date for production to restart has not been established, but Hartmann indicated the company is hoping it will be sooner rather than later.
 “There will be a staggered startup over the course of the next couple weeks,” she said. “It is our intent to bring back a small number of (production) folks this week.”
 In addition to the confirmed case of COVID-19, Hartmann said there is another “probable” case involving an employee of John Deere Dubuque Works.
 Deere initially disclosed this probable case last week and noted that the employee had not been to work since March 19.
 The temporary closure will allow for a swift and rigorous cleaning process.
 “The facility will undergo a thorough disinfection that meets or exceeds local and state health-department guidance — including third party industrial hygiene assessments,” Deere said in an official company statement.
 Deere employs 1,400 production workers and 1,000 salaried workers in Dubuque, according to Hartmann. She said many salaried employees already were working remotely prior to the production shutdown.
 Deere is considered “essential” by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Hartmann emphasized that the company is committed to resuming production. However, this must be done with employee safety in mind.
 “In addition to robust disinfection, and efforts to ensure employees do not come to work with any illness, enhanced social distancing in common areas, on the production line, in entry points and any break areas are a top priority,” Hartmann told the Telegraph Herald.
 Hartmann also noted that any individuals known to be in direct contact with the employee who tested positive for COVID-19 were contacted and asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, following CDC guidance.
 Dan White, president of the UAW Local 94, said he learned Sunday that the Deere plant would be shutting down for at least a couple of days, after which company officials would reevaluate the situation.
 White acknowledged the phone has been ringing more than usual at the offices of UAW Local 94, which represents union workers at John Deere Dubuque Works.
 He has been fielding calls from union members, as well as their spouses and family members.
 “We are having a hard time answering their questions,” he admitted. “It is kind of a wait-and-see situation.”
 He said production employees are worried about their paychecks, as well as their own health and well-being.
 “There are some people who are concerned about continuing to go to work, and there are others who are worried they won’t be able to continue to work,” he said.
 A prolonged shutdown would spell trouble not only for Deere, but for countless other local manufacturers that count the company among their biggest clients.
 Rick Dickinson, president and CEO of Greater Dubuque Development Corp., said John Deere Dubuque Works is a critical part of the local economy.
 “If they get a cold, we all get a cold,” Dickinson said. “Deere is the driver of much of the manufacturing sector in the Dubuque market. We are blessed to have them here.”
 Deere isn’t the only local manufacturer trying to navigate a way forward in a complex and rapidly changing environment.
 In many cases, making these adjustments on the fly can be difficult.
 “Companies are finding ways to create social separation in an environment that was not designed to have that,” Dickinson said. “They are being innovative and learning new things as they go.”

Zurich told the _Observer_ that it was not possible to list all potential exclusions, so customers are instead informed of specific circumstances where cancellation is covered. Given how much insurers rely on small print to wriggle out of claims, this is not good enough. In answer to which, Zurich points me to its small print. On page 68 of the information document issued to LJ, cover is mentioned for changed FCO advice, but that only applies to those with the pricier extra policy. This rather undermines Zurich’s claim that it can’t include all possible exclusions. The Financial Ombudsman Service can decide whether this is unfair.

Maybe I should have dumped the contents of one of my plastic shopping bags into my trunk and used the bag to pick up the grimy mask and then carried it across the parking lot to the trash can at the store entrance. But I didn't have the presence of mind to do that, at the time.

A number of European countries have complained about the quality of the equipment being supplied by China to help deal with the coronavirus outbreak.


  Over the weekend, The Netherlands recalled thousands of masks imported from China because of quality issues, while Spain complained about defective imported test kits supplied by a Chinese manufacturer, media reports said.


  China's foreign ministry said several countries had raised doubts about the quality of products imported from China, and acknowledged that there might be some problems.


  "A large number of Chinese manufacturers are working around the clock to help other countries save lives. Our sincerity and assistance is real. If problems occur in this process, the Chinese side will talk to relevant departments," China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference on Monday.


  Meanwhile, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that states across the US are "fighting" amongst themselves to source essential medical supplies as coronavirus cases in the country surge daily and "ironically" most entities are looking to buy from China.


  "We need supplies desperately and we're working on that... we're in a situation where you have 50 states all competing for supplies. The federal government is now also competing for supplies. Private hospitals are also competing for supplies. So we've created a situation where you literally have hundreds of entities looking to buy the same exact materials, basically from the same place which is China, ironically enough. We're fighting amongst ourselves. We're competing amongst ourselves," Cuomo said at a press conference.


  The deadly coronavirus that first originated in Chinese city of Wuhan last last year has killed 3,305 people in the US and infected 81,518.


  China was emerging as a favourite possible supplier at this stage as new virus infections were slowing there and its factories were being pushed to reopen.

A Company representative checked each drill rig at least once per day during drilling to monitor sample collection. For core drilling, Company geologists completed paper or digital logs on the whole core. The logs captured and illustrated core recovery, sample intervals, lithologic data, hydrothermal alteration, mineralogy and structural features. Structural features were measured with respect to the core axis. When available, structural features were measured on core oriented using a Reflex Act 2 orienting device. Photographs were taken of all drill core, labeled with drill hole footages and sample intervals. RC drill chips were also logged on paper or digital logs by Company geologists. The data from the paper drill logs were later captured in electronic spreadsheets for both core and RC drill holes.

The world of startup financing is incredibly murky. When trying to find financing, founders typically get a random recommendation from a friend/lawyer/banker who is under-informed, or they roll up their sleeves and start researching the entire space from scratch. Then, after finding a financier, they're left to negotiate the terms blindly and without context. So I built Bootstrapp to level the playing field.

 To prepare for the competition, Architech trained at Palmer’s house “in the living room, which is much warmer than a garage,” Grilli joked. They met twice a week for two- to three-hour sessions, 10 months a year.
 As the competition entails a series of tasks to be completed by the robot in a maximum amount of time of two minutes and 30 seconds, Grilli said the students must devise a strategy to complete as many tasks as possible in the least amount of time and in the most reliable way, using a robot they have to design and program from scratch.

Since the story is narrated backwards, from the break-up to the first meeting, and all the actions happen in reverse, pre-visualisation was crucial. Deepak’s team designed 2D animated storyboards so that the crew had no ambiguity in what to execute.
 Scratch the surface of what appears like a simple rom-com and Deepak presents the protagonist Surya as a metaphor to the sun, romancing women who represent different seasons — Chaitra (spring), Varsha (monsoon) and Sita (winter). He equates it to “the sun going through different seasons”. Since the story unfolds from Surya’s point of view and in reality, thought processes can be random, the first few minutes offer glimpses into Surya’s observations and thoughts. Eventually, Deepak had to bring in a structure to narrate the story.
 Deepak is an engineer who got drawn towards cinema. After his engineering graduation in Kurnool, he briefly worked with an IT firm. He then enrolled in a film school in Hyderabad but eventually dropped out, not wanting to be bound by film theories. “I wanted to know the rules of filmmaking only to break them,” he says.
 Before Tharun Bhascker’s _Pellichoopulu_ (2016), Deepak remembers that it wasn’t easy for outsiders to break into the Telugu film industry and pitch stories to producers. His family, too, wanted him to be financially secure. That’s how he and Harikanth had started Kala Media.
 In the meantime, Deepak also did a masters programme in the US. Not wanting to be disconnected with cinema, in 2016 he made the short film _Hide and Seek_ , which won him appreciation in Telugu film circles.
 The love for cinema was further fuelled when he was asked if he could assist and coordinate things on the sets of Sekhar Kammula’s _Fidaa_ , when the crew was filming in the US. “That’s when I decided I had to make films. I convinced my mother and returned to India in mid 2017,” says Deepak.
 Once in India, he felt he needed to understand the business dynamics of the film industry before he turned director, and started Weekend Cinema, a marketing and distribution company and has so far distributed 14 films.
 The next step is to make his directorial debut through a feature film.

After Ward 4 Councilman Tollie Rowe announced he would not be seeking re- election for the Sedalia City Council, two individuals are vying for the seat.


  The April 7 General Municipal Election has been postponed to June 2 due to COVID-19. The issue was at the forefront for candidate Rhiannon Foster when she was asked about the top issues facing Sedalia.


  “If you’d asked this question two months ago, that list I think would be completely different,” she said. “I think right now everyone is worried with the pandemic. I think that right now it’s going to be making sure that the water is working, we still have electricity, basic needs because I feel like life is changing...


  “Keeping the police officers safe and the firefighters safe. Just the whole scheme of it. How do you do all that?” she added.


  Foster is a member of the Sedalia Park Board, is active with the Smith-Cotton Basketball Booster Club and is in the middle of opening her small business, Tiger Coffee. Foster has a bachelor’s degree in political science and wants to continue her involvement in the city by running for the council.


  “First off I want to listen,” Foster said. “I think it’s important that I don’t have a personal agenda. I want to represent the Fourth Ward and be their voice. That’s very important to me. That and I think Sedalia is moving in a very positive direction and I definitely want to continue to help foster that.


  “I’ve always been involved,” she continued. “I’ve loved my time on park board and I think the Fourth Ward needs positive, new eyes. I’m someone who will listen and ask questions and find solutions to benefit the Fourth Ward.”


  Foster said she believes her time on the Sedalia Park Board has helped prepare and qualify her for the Ward 4 seat.


  “We’ve (Park Board) worked with city council on so many things that you get a different perspective being involved already with the city,” she explained. “Just the involvement with the processes and funding and the budgets and the different aspects. Until you are involved I think it’s really hard to understand what it really entails.”


  Foster is especially passionate about helping bring the Heckart Community Center to Sedalia.


  “My dad was on park board and worked on trying to get a community center,” she said. “I’m so excited. I rallied for a community center for my whole life basically. It’s been so needed and I’m so excited that we are finally getting a community center…I think it’s going to be a great asset to Sedalia. I think it’s going to bring in a lot of people.”


  Foster said she thinks the city’s focus on neighborhood revitalization is positive and that there are many people in the city who “just need some assistance getting some stuff cleaned up.” She also likes how the neighborhood cleanups have helped people meet their neighbors and believes “unity in the community is very important.”


  The top issues individuals in the community have talked to Foster about are sidewalks, potholes and trash collection. Foster said she doesn’t think her goals on the council should be personal but should be what the people in Ward 4 want since she will be representing them. She also wants to keep Sedalia growing and thinks bringing in new industries is important.


  Foster said she wants to listen to residents and help Sedalia continue to grow and prosper.


  “I’m a self-employed mother of two boys, Dane and Yale, a native-born Sedalian who is seeking election to represent the Fourth Ward on the city council. My love of this community runs deep. My parents, Greg and Suzanne, raised me being involved and committed to this city and its residents...


  “Your concerns are my concerns,” she continued. “I will talk to you and be your voice in finding solutions and fostering growth to make Sedalia and the Fourth Ward a better place to live, work and play.”


  Foster said she believes people should vote for her because of her deep love for Sedalia, involvement in the park board and lifetime community involvement. She said she is a good listener and is approachable. She also believes there needs to be a balance on the council.


  “There needs to be a good balance of different ages and different perspectives from different walks of life...” she said.


  “I think that it’s important that if you have an issue that you feel like you can approach your councilperson and talk to them,” she added. “That they’re open to listening and that’s really important.”


  Foster has been endorsed by the Sedalia Firefighters Local 103.

Underfed and chained up for endless hours, campaigners warn many elephants working in Thailand's tourism sector may starve, be sold to zoos or shifted into the illegal logging trade as the coronavirus decimates visitor numbers.
 Before the virus, life for the kingdom's estimated 2,000 elephants working in tourism was already stressful, with abusive methods often used to 'break them' into giving rides and performing tricks at money-spinning animal shows.
 With global travel paralysed the animals are unable to pay their way, including the 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of food a day a captive elephant needs to survive.
 Elephant camps and conservationists warn hunger and the threat of renewed exploitation lie ahead, without an urgent bailout.
 "My boss is doing what he can but we have no money," Kosin, a mahout -- or elephant handler -- says of the Chiang Mai camp where his elephant Ekkasit is living on a restricted diet.
 Chiang Mai is Thailand's northern tourist hub, an area of rolling hills dotted by elephant camps and sanctuaries ranging from the exploitative to the humane.
 Footage sent to AFP from another camp in the area shows lines of elephants tethered by a foot to wooden poles, some visibly distressed, rocking their heads back and forth.
 Around 2,000 elephants are currently "unemployed" as the virus eviscerates Thailand's tourist industry, says Theerapat Trungprakan, president of the Thai Elephant Alliance Association.
 The lack of cash is limiting the fibrous food available to the elephants "which will have a physical effect", he added.
 Wages for the mahouts who look after them have dropped by 70 percent.
 Theerapat fears the creatures could soon be used in illegal logging activities along the Thai-Myanmar border -- in breach of a 30-year-old law banning the use of elephants to transport wood.
 Others "could be forced (to beg) on the streets," he said.
 It is yet another twist in the saga of the exploitation of elephants, which animal rights campaigners have long been fighting to protect from the abusive tourism industry.
 \- 'Crisis point' -
 For those hawking a once-in-a-lifetime experience with the giant creatures -- whether from afar or up close -- the slump began in late January.
 Chinese visitors, who make up the majority of Thailand's 40 million tourists, plunged by more than 80 percent in February as China locked down cities hard- hit by the virus and banned external travel.
 By March, the travel restrictions into Thailand -- which has 1,388 confirmed cases of the virus -- had extended to Western countries.
 With elephants increasingly malnourished due to the loss of income, the situation is "at a crisis point," says Saengduean Chailert, owner of Elephant Nature Park.
 Her sanctuary for around 80 rescued pachyderms only allows visitors to observe the creatures, a philosophy at odds with venues that have them performing tricks and offering rides.
 She has organised a fund to feed elephants and help mahouts in almost 50 camps nationwide, fearing the only options will soon be limited to zoos, starvation or logging work.
 For those restrained by short chains all day, the stress could lead to fights breaking out, says Saengduean, of camps that can no longer afford medical treatment for the creatures.
 Calls are mounting for the government to fund stricken camps to ensure the welfare of elephants.
 "We need 1,000 baht a day (about $30) for each elephant," says Apichet Duangdee, who runs the Elephant Rescue Park.
 Freeing his eight mammals rescued from circuses and loggers into the forests is out of the question as they would likely be killed in territorial fights with wild elephants.
 He is planning to take out a two million baht ($61,000) loan soon to keep his elephants fed.
 "I will not abandon them," he added.

An active merchant marine may sound at odds with a landlocked nation such as Switzerland, but the country prides itself of its high-seas fleet. The discovery of film footage by Swiss sailors in the 1960s led to a Zurich exhibition that explores some of the most pressing contemporary issues related to the sea.  
 The vast expanse of the sea its promise of freedom was what Ernst Christinger sought when, after barely reaching legal age, he left the Swiss village of Azmoos in the late 1950s to become a sailor.
 During the following 15 years, he travelled the world aboard the MS Basilea, one of the most well-known trading ships flying the Swiss flag.
 Ernst and his fellow crew members documented their life at sea with Super 8 film cameras they had bought cheaply during a port call in Hong Kong. His son, Damian, found these films, along with a trove of other documents, postcards, photos after Ernst’s death.
 The sentimental affection was evident for Damian Chistinger as he scanned the material, shedding light on Ernst’s life before fatherhood.
 That landlocked Switzerland had a merchant marine might sound paradoxical. As a curator, Damian looked at these films and saw an opportunity to dive deeper into a not very well-known part of Swiss history.
 He teamed up with Roger Buergel, the director of of the Johann Jacobs Museum in Zurich, and the researcher Bettina Schuler, and together they expanded the scope of the material to develop what became the exhibition “A ship will not come.” Their collaboration turned into a reflection on some of the most pressing contemporary issues of life at sea at the Zurich museum.
 The project fell into very good hands. Buergel, the museum’s director, revamped the then Coffee Museum in Zurich (as the Jacobs Museum used to be known), transforming it into a sort of laboratory devoted to the exploration of trade routes and global issues through the interweaving of art, science and social research.

Low cost of storage of designs on transfer paper as compared to the designs on textiles is expected to add in the growth of the transfer papers market. The use of transfer papers in the short run productions over the direct printing is expected to set a trend in the market. Transfer paper printing gets expensive and time consuming for the large quantity printing which in turn is expected to hamper the market growth of transfer papers in near future.

It would be no exaggeration to state that the emperor's regime dreaded the democratic exercise and liberal political climate in Eritrea lest the practice set precedent and modern political thoughts took root throughout the whole empire. Such a development would indeed diminish the dignity and prerogative of the emperor who claimed divine right to govern and it would reduce the power and privileges of the neftenya governing class, which upheld and fostered his outmoded, discriminatory and assimilationist policies. In the end, the emperor and his minions set to dismantle Eritrea's autonomy. They succeeded in tearing down to pieces the Ethiopia-Eritrea federal exercise in 1960 through corruption, by playing different interest groups against one another and through naked harassment and intimidation of local leaders. And, the rest is history. A tragic part of that history is thirty years of war between Eritrean liberation forces and the government of Ethiopia which dissipated immense human and material resources but, in the end, utterly failed to prevent Eritrea's independence. It is in the interest of all interested parties that, the current power elites learn from this disastrous experience and cease and desist tampering with the constitutional settlement since 1991. They should practice tolerance, understanding and cooperation and keep in perspective the interest of peace, equality, justice and above all the very continuity of the country.

Pressing demand for food worldwide has led to indiscriminate use of pesticides worldwide. Most of the pesticides used contain toxic or poisonous substances and their extensive use not just pollutes the soil and water but also makes the food unhealthy to consume. Repeated and too much use of such pesticides damages non-targeted areas for they usually spread over to the entire area under cultivation. Further, pesticides also get accumulated as residuals in running ground waters, thus bringing down soil fertility. Such negative impacts have made several authorities across the globe ban pesticides or limit their usage.

But first, I will address a broad understanding of how a board might move through the water. If a basic model can be formed, that allows a better grasp of how this might affect stroke mechanics or how stroke mechanics effect the board. I often look toward other sources of information that can help describe these patterns and will draw upon Nordic / Cross Country Skiing (XC) and structural engineering in the form of tensegrity – after all, few concepts are ever truly original, why reinvent the wheel when it has been done so several times to great effect.

With coronavirus halting all other duties for the time being, Kitrosser told _La Jolla Light_ the only way volunteers can continue their RSVP work is by conducting YANA checks via phone calls.
 The program currently has six elderly community members in need, so six RSVP members were assigned an individual to call on the days they would usually be visited.
 On the afternoon of March 2, _La Jolla Light_ went on a ride-along with Kitrosser and Johnson to visit one of Northern Division’s favorite YANAs. 103-year-old Vivian has been in the program for more than a decade.
 “These guys have been so faithful to come and visit me for — what, 15 or 20 years?” she mused. “They will thread my needle (for sewing projects) and clean my vacuum cleaner. They go overboard to be caring and loving and attentive. Oh yes, they’re a _fine_ bunch of people.”

 In addition, Limburg said city voters should expect some changes if the election is held as scheduled.

Mbabazi's best years of political profitability are way behind him. As observed earlier, the dominance of aged leaders in the ranks of the party points towards the need for the empowerment of young and energetic leaders with the capacity to ensure political continuity. At 71 years of age, it would be asking Mbabazi too much if he is the one to lead or promote mobilisation for the party. At a time when young people like Frank Tumwebaze, Nakiwala Kiyingi, Muhoozi among others should be entrusted with holding the party at their shoulders, more power to Mbabazi would be an obstruction for the young blood in the party. In this very regard, it would serve NRM best if Mbabazi mends fences with his old friend and return to the party but just in an advisory capacity so he paves way for the people whose leadership capabilities are bound to benefit the NRM for some decades to come.

The government has decided to extend the validity of driving licenses that expired on February 1 in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The expired licenses will now be valid until June 30, 2020.


  The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has issued an advisory to states and union territories, asking them to consider documents like driving licenses, permits and registration papers which expired on February 1 this year to be valid till June 30 under the Motor Vehicle Rules.


  The move comes in the wake of the 3-week Covid-19 lockdown to ensure that people don't experience any inconvenience due to the closure of the transport offices. The decision is also to help essential service providers carry out their operations during and after the lockdown without any hassle.


  The Centre has strictly asked all state authorities to ensure that no movement takes place during the lockdown in cities, on highways or across the border. This comes after thousands of migrant workers and daily wage earners were seen on a mass exodus, trying to reach their native lands.


  India has reported over 1,200 Covid-19 cases and more than 30 deaths so far. 100 people have recovered from the infection. On Tuesday, the country entered the seventh day of the 3-week Covid-19 lockdown.


  The coronavirus pandemic has affected nearly 700,000 people across the globe. More than 30,000 people worldwide have been killed by the deadly contagion which started last year from China's Wuhan.


  Besides China, the United States, Italy, Spain, France and Iran are some of the worst-hit nations by the Covid-19 crisis.

Clubs on the continent are particularly struggling, with Juventus and Barcelona asking players to defer wages and take a pay cut respectively. While Real are yet to follow suit, their financial position is only marginally stronger. It's difficult to see how any of those clubs could now justify an outlay of more than £100million on a single player, especially one who may have questions to answer over his fitness.
 That may leave Pogba stuck in Manchester once more, but how he goes about this summer will give United their answer as to how much to persevere with the 27-year-old. If he knuckles down and enters talks of a new contract, which currently expires in 2021 with the option of a further year, then it will show the signs that he could yet see a long-term future at Old Trafford.
 But if Raiola threatens to cause trouble again and Pogba or his agent agitate for a move away, then United will surely know it's the end of the road. Take the option on his contract and look to do the best deal possible for the club when the market recovers.

The volunteer shoppers head to the grocery stores early in the morning to “beat all the hoarders.” Everyone typically works a 4-5 hour shift, said Hays, and people swap out throughout the day. Deliveries are made from 10 a.m. until dark, while mornings and evenings are reserved for preparing for the next day.


  The volunteers purchase food and other necessities such as handsanitizer, soap, disinfectant wipes and packages of Depends.


  Hays said the volunteers are occasionally confronted by other shoppers, who at first believe they are unnecessarily hoarding. Some store managers will allow the volunteers to continue, while others are not so lenient.


  “We feel like we’re fighting for our elderly, health-compromised residents and it’s become inspirational for all of us, so we don’t mind a little confrontation,” Hays said.


  After the shopping is finished, volunteers bring the groceries back to Firehouse American Eatery & Lounge, 722 Grand Ave., from whose top floor they are currently operating from. (This is their fourth operations location due to expansion.)


  Hays said all it took was a brief 10-minute conversation with the owner of Firehouse, Matt Spencer, before he jumped on board, eager to help and offer the space. “Now, he’s delivering groceries himself,” Hays pointed out.

This is the most important tip. For instance it can be especially costly to rent a skip that is too small, so the best rule of thumb is to rent a skip size slightly bigger than what you think will accommodate the clean-up, as renting a skip that's too small can lead to needing a second one to finish the clean- up.

Fortunately, much of the “dead wood” (old fabs) has already been cleared out and the global manufacturing capacity that remains is regarded as fairly efficient.

The chief executives of AFL and Cricket Australia will tackle the looming schedule squeeze together, but the Twenty20 World Cup remains an immovable object.


  Uncertainty continues to cloud the 2020 AFL season plus coming months for Australia's male and female cricket teams because of the COVID-19 pandemic


  AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan and CA counterpart Kevin Roberts have been dealt notably different cards amid the current nation-wide shutdown.


  CA is obviously better placed to weather the financial storm.


  However, Roberts has told staff that cost-cutting measures are inevitable as the governing body attempts to plan for a coming summer despite great uncertainty for players, administrators, sponsors and broadcasters.


  CA had mapped out its international schedule for 2020-21, with the highlight being India's four-Test tour, but the already-congested international cricket calendar will soon be in a state of flux as boards around the world start to scrap and/or postpone series.


  The T20 World Cup, running October 18 to November 15 in Australia, is locked in; or as much as any sporting event can be in the current climate.


  It's understood the World Cup organising committee has venue agreements in place, including exclusivity periods, with six state governments, the MCG and six other grounds that host AFL games in winter.


  The AFL has repeatedly outlined its intent to push on with a 2020 season, even if that means football is played long beyond September.


  Roberts couldn't unpick an International Cricket Council event like the World Cup, even if he wanted to, but has made it clear "the issues we are confronting today are bigger than any one sport".


  "We obviously have obligations to fulfil during the 20-21 cricket season, assuming sport is back up and running," Roberts said on Tuesday.


  "That said we continue to work with other sports to support them while meeting these obligations."


  Cricket Victoria's BBL boss Nick Cummins declared on Monday that Marvel Stadium may be owned by the AFL, but Melbourne Renegades have exclusive use of the venue from December 16 onwards.


  Nonetheless, Marvel looms as the obvious home for the bulk of the 2020 AFL season should it occur.


  McLachlan wasn't alarmed by Cummins' comments.


  "I hope that in the end this is bigger than all of that," he told SEN.


  "I've been talking to other sports on other fronts, we will all work together and there are enough venues and enough goodwill that all the problems will be able to be worked through with venues and other sports.


  "I would imagine that all of that stuff can be worked through if necessary."
