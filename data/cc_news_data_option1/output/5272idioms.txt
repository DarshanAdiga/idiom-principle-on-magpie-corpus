The story itself is told in distinct segments, but in true LucasArts fashion, sometimes you'll be treated to a "meanwhile" transition, where the game cuts away to a scene of the villains offering more exposition on what is happening from their end. You'll soon find that Sundӓe is a town full of mysteries that you need to get to the bottom of. While Akiro and Krakovitz try to secure entry to the party the real movie director was invited to (before he was rudely ambushed, stripped, and left at the side of the road), they will encounter quirky new mysteries to solve: Who is the vigilante mime? And what is up with the strange small man who owns the three-testicled-salmon truck? These questions, and more, will be answered as the two heroes investigate and ultimately attempt to sabotage Nazi operations.

COVID-19 didn’t create problems inside the Texas prison system, so much as it magnified them. A November report from the University of Texas at Austin points to the devastating impact of the coronavirus behind bars. People incarcerated in Texas prisons have been infected at a 40 percent higher rate and died at a 35 percent higher rate than the national prison population average, according to the report. More people incarcerated here have died from COVID-19 than in any other prison system; more than half of them were eligible for parole, and at least nine had already been approved for release. The report also shows how Texas prisons have struggled to reduce coronavirus- related deaths compared to other state prison systems that also had high death counts early in the pandemic.

Mr Hinchliffe has been recalled from holidays to deal with a growing tourism crisis in the wake of border closures because of a coronavirus outbreak in NSW.Mr Hinchliffe said any Sydneysiders who were unable to make it to Queensland should immediately cancel to allow locals to snap up bargains, a comment that has rankled LNP leader Mr Crisafulli.Queensland closed its borders on Tuesday and is denying entry to anyone who has visited or resides in greater Sydney or the city’s northern beaches.The hard border closure will continue until at least January 8. “I ask those from interstate to keep the faith,” Mr Crisafulli said.“The stupidity we heard today is not reflective of what the industry is saying.“You can ask anyone in the industry; no one is telling anyone from Sydney to cancel their bookings.“That shows a guy who just doesn’t get it and if he’s not going to defend Queensland tourism, I am.”Mr Hinchliffe suggested many accommodations booked by people from greater Sydney were in destinations “now hard to find” and tour operators should be flexible with refunds when possible.“We’re expecting strong interest from interstate and Queensland holiday-makers in snapping up cancelled bookings from greater Sydney,” Mr Hinchliffe said on Tuesday.Mr Crisafulli said the Palaszczuk government needed to keep referring to that date when discussing border closures and not send mixed messages about potentially keeping the border closed beyond January 8. “I ask the state government … certainly not to tell people to cancel their holidays,” he said.“You’ve got a date that the Health Minister said they will review things; don’t send mixed messages beyond that date.“That still gives us almost all of January, all of February (for people to travel).”He said in light of no international tourism and restrictions on interstate travel, Queenslanders should consider holidaying at home or up in the north or west of the state.“My message is that if you have the capacity holiday in Queensland and that may mean staying in the city you live,” he said.Mr Hinchliffe had his holiday leave cut short on Wednesday, two days after he checked out for Christmas.A spokesman told The Courier-Mail that Mr Hinchliffe’s trip was to “host meetings with tourism industry stakeholders and Queensland Health”. Cairns Tourism Industry Association president Kevin Byrne called Mr Hinchliffe’s holiday “disrespectful” to struggling tourism operators.“For him to go on leave at this crucial time sends a dreadful message to the tourism industry,” he said.“These guys have been (to) hell and back in the past nine months.

The humour is generally on point, and I even found myself laughing out loud on a couple of occasions, though a lot of the farting and bowel-based gags didn't really land for me. Running gags are prevalent throughout, such as a clown with awful puns whom the in-game characters seem to find hilarious, and there's a strange giggle that begins to spread between the townspeople, almost like a disease. Meta jokes are often used as well, at one point going all in on the fourth wall breaking. While all this works most of the time comedically, it can also detract from the immersion the game otherwise does so well to create. A little humour to relieve tension is always welcome, but some over-the-top elements feel at odds with the game's more serious themes.

One wrestler that immediately jumps out is the newly renamed Oho. Part of a sumo lineage that includes perhaps the greatest _yokozuna_ of all time (Taiho) as well as a disgraced former _sekiwake_ (Takatoriki), Oho and two of his brothers fight out of an Otake stable that was established by their grandfather in the 1970s.
 Oho’s father also lifted the Emperor’s Cup while active, but Takatoriki is more known these days for his role in a betting scandal and a controversial YouTube channel where he throws out all kinds of allegations including those about match-fixing in sumo.
 Oho will obviously be hoping for a career closer to that of his grandfather (Taiho), who held the record for most top division championships for 46 years before Hakuho eclipsed it in 2015.
 Still just 20 years old, Oho has made steady, if unspectacular, progress since turning pro in 2018.
 Known as Naya until his recent promotion to _sekitori_ , the Tokyo native has the physique and ability required to carve out a successful career in sumo’s upper reaches, however. Now free from the duties and responsibilities of lower division life and able to concentrate solely on sumo, Oho is a good bet to start taking advantage of the potential that has long been apparent. If he can get off to a fast start in January, a division title in his jūryō debut wouldn’t be a huge surprise.
 If spectacular is a word that can’t be applied to Oho’s career so far, the opposite is certainly the case when it comes to a teenage wrestler who joins the makushita division just as Oho is leaving it.
 Standing two meters tall and weighing over 160 kilograms, Hokuseiho remains unbeaten since joining _ōzumō_ last March.
 Currently on a 23-bout winning streak, Hokuseiho, who was born in Mongolia but has lived in Japan from early childhood, has a good chance of breaking the record for most consecutive wins from entry into the sport.
 If _maezumō_ bouts and playoffs are included, Itai’s 30 straight victories from his debut in the late 1970s is currently the best start. Hokuseiho could better that with a 7-0 record in January followed by a playoff win.

The Council and Commission also discussed potential sales and excise taxes on marijuana businesses. Sales tax would apply to the retail stores, while excise tax would apply to cultivation. They looked at four other cities in Colorado and what they are able to generate in revenue from those taxes. The revenue ranged from $625,000 in Glenwood Springs to $5.4 million in Boulder. Wortmann said he thought Grand Junction might be similar to Longmont, which collects around $820,000 a year. Voters would have to approve the marijuana tax, which would be part of the ballot question.
 Gloss reviewed potential regulations the city could impose, which would likely be formed at the council level. Those included creating buffers around schools, parks and places of worship, limiting businesses to commercial and certain business zones and putting a cap on the number of marijuana businesses. Gloss said he would work with the Planning Commission on next zoning steps.
 Council Member Chuck McDaniel said he did not think a ballot measure would pass without specifying where the money would be used. Gloss presented options that came from the public, which included spending it on parks, a community center, public safety, education or for mental health. Commissioner Andrea Haitz said she has heard concern in the community about what this would do to the downtown area.
 “It does need to be presented to the people,” Haitz said. “I think if we make it too complicated, it may lock some things in. However, I know the concern is going to be, will Grand Junction downtown end up like Denver downtown, which is what a lot of people I talk to are concerned about.”

It’s an incredible run made all the more amazing by the fact that Hokuseiho is a rikishi only because of a chance encounter with Hakuho in an airport when a small child. The yokozuna encouraged him to give sumo a try and join his stable when he grew up.
 Makushita is the first real test of a sumo wrestler’s abilities however, so despite his lightning-fast start and overwhelming physical size, Hokuseiho has probably only a 50-50 chance at best of setting a new mark.
 A title win isn’t out of the question, but in a 120-man division there is always the possibility of someone else with a relatively easier schedule going unbeaten. The giant youngster will have his destiny in his own hands, but one momentary lapse is all it could take for the championship in his division to go elsewhere.
 One tier up, things won’t be so tight for Oho. Parity is the name of the game in sumo’s second division and playoffs among two or more men with the same record are common. If the youngster manages to go unbeaten in his paid debut, he’ll be just the sixth man in history with a 15-0 record in jūryō. The previous five include four _ozeki_ and one yokozuna.
 Oho and Hokuseiho are the headliners in jūryō and makushita respectively, but they are far from the only ones to watch in those divisions.
 Whether it’s the continuing efforts of someone like Ura to fight back from devastating injury and regain a spot at the top table, the struggles of men such as Mitoryu to translate amateur glory into success in the pro ranks or just watching any of the aging veterans trying to stave off the losing record that will mean inevitable demotion and almost certain retirement, sumo’s second tier provides plenty of reasons to watch.
 Although as a division lower it is more a case of spotting the superstars in the making as they hone their craft, makushita, like jūryō, is one that offers a lot for sumo fans willing to take a look at what’s happening just off the main stage.

His home debut will likely be in a two-game series against the Shiga Lakestars at Yokohama International Swimming Pool from Jan. 2-3.
 “Our senior players have welcomed me with open arms,” the 172-cm point guard said during an introductory news conference in Yokohama on Tuesday.
 Kawamura enrolled at Tokai University this spring and was a part of the Seagulls squad that won the All-Japan Intercollegiate Basketball Championship earlier this month.
 Admitting he received interest from several other clubs, Kawamura hinted that he chose the B-Corsairs, who have posted a 7-16 record in the 2020-21 season, in order to avoid neglecting his academic duties at Tokai, which is located in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture.
 Last year, Kawamura sent a shock wave through the entire league as a member of the San-en NeoPhoenix. The Yamaguchi Prefecture native joined the Aichi Prefecture-based team a month after he navigated his Fukuoka Daiichi High School team to a second consecutive title at the All-Japan High School Tournament in late December.
 Stepping onto the court as the youngest-ever player to compete in the B. League at 18 years, eight months and 23 days, Kawamura — still a high school student at the time — quickly came through for the NeoPhoenix, capitalizing on his blazing speed and exceptional court vision.
 He wound up playing in 11 contests with seven starts, averaging 12.6 points, 3.1 assists and 1.5 steals, earning a selection to the league's all-rookie team for the 2019-20 season.
 Despite that success, Kawamura insisted that his latest stint with Yokohama would be nothing but “another challenge” on the path to becoming one of the best players that the country has ever seen.
 “I’ve put my three years in high school behind me and have had so many issues,” Kawamura said. “And to overcome them, I enrolled at the university and now this will be another challenge. I would like to contribute to the team earning as many wins as it can.”
 His time with the NeoPhoenix showed that Kawamura needed to improve on his physicality in order to play in the professional ranks. But he's bulked up thanks to Tokai’s advanced strength and conditioning program.
 “Playing for San-en in the B. League as a specially designated player last year, I found out the lack of my physicality and muscle volume were clear issues,” said Kawamura, who stated that he's gained about two to three kilograms since he graduated from high school. “So I’ve worked hard on my physical training this past year.”
 Meanwhile, B-Corsairs first-year head coach Kyle Milling said that he is impressed with Kawamura's maturity level and high basketball IQ. But the American also tried to not place too much pressure on the youngster.
 “We have had many games that were very close and were missing just a little bit to push ourselves over the top,” Milling said. “And as a coach, I’m not counting Yuki to win us games individually, and I know what I’m looking for is the little extra that I think Yuki can do to push us over the top.”
 Just like when he played for the NeoPhoenix, Yokohama hopes the acquisition of the former Japan U-16 player will contribute to the team's exposure.
 “He drew a lot of attention through the media last year,” Tetsuya Ueda, B-Corsairs president and general manager, said of Kawamura, who cited star guards like Yuta Tabuse of the Utsunomiya Brex and Yuki Togashi of the Chiba Jets Funabashi as players he aspires to emulate. “He’s got an overwhelming value as a player, and that was another major reason why we pursued him.”

As fall approached, Dilling and her team knew that if they didn’t get the structure up quickly, they would have to wait for spring, pushing back the homeowner’s move-in date by a half-year or more.
 “That doesn’t seem like a very long time, but when you’re living in a situation that’s not ideal, a couple months can make a huge difference in getting into a stable, more affordable place to live,” she said.
 Dilling contacted local construction companies, seeking a partnership. At Kruser Construction, owner Andy Kruser answered the call.
 “Initially, she wanted a quote,” he said. “And I said, ‘You would pay us?’ And she said, ‘Well, yeah.’ And I said, ‘Don’t worry about it. We’ll just do it.’”
 Dilling said Kruser’s generosity prompted “a huge sigh of relief.” Not only did the partnership speed up the project’s timeline, but the company’s donation of time and labor provided a boost for Habitat in a year of economic hardship.
 “In addition to the challenges of bringing volunteers out, the cost of building supplies and materials went up exponentially this year,” Dilling said. “We were going up against a couple different challenges.”
 For Kruser, the decision to lend a hand was an easy one.
 “I personally believe that the more successful you become, the more you should give back,” he said. “It’s been a crazy year with COVID, and everybody’s having their own individual struggles … so when she called, I instantly thought it was a great idea for me and my employees.”
 Kruser Construction started framing the house Dec. 2 and had it weather-tight by Dec. 7. A small group of regular Habitat volunteers will continue to work on the interior during the winter.
 If all goes well, the new homeowner, Ashley Bergfeld, of Bernard, Iowa, and her four children will move into her new home in late spring.
 “I am so grateful and pleased to know that there are a few good souls out there willing and able to help those in need like me and my kids,” Bergfeld wrote in an email to the Telegraph Herald.
 Dilling said the pandemic and the resulting economic difficulties faced by many families have made affordable housing more important than ever.

Perth captain Mitch Marsh would be “all for” the DRS being used after the Scorchers were robbed of a wicket in their seven-wicket loss to the Sydney Thunder.Umpire Simon Lightbody was heard telling Perth bowler AJ Tye he believed Thunder batsman Usman Khawaja’s bat hit the ground after a strong, and what appeared clear-cut caught behind appeal. But Tye protested the bat was nowhere near the turf, which was backed up by every single replay that showed Lightbody was way off the mark. The ONLY place to watch every match of the 2020/21 KFC BBL Season Live &amp; Ad-Break Free During Play is on Fox Cricket, available on Kayo. New to Kayo? Get your free trial now &amp; start streaming instantly &gt; Khawaja was on 18 at the time, and made just three more before being dismissed. But Marsh, who was also the victim of a growing number of bad umpiring decisions this BBL season, would be keen for DRS to come in. “As a player you like to see stuff introduced, I would be all for it,” Marsh said.“It’s probably above my pay grade to really be commenting on that. But I’d certainly be all for it if it was introduced.“It’s probably a case of (needing) to go all in, or not (at all).”The Big Bash League has never used DRS and this year was unable to afford the reported $1.5 million needed to spend on the state-of-the-art technology for the nine-week tournament. With the COVID-19 pandemic draining cricket’s finances, it was even less of a chance to come in this year. The BBL’s maiden season in 2011-12 allowed third umpires to overrule incorrect decisions off replays, without using added technology. Melbourne Stars captain Glenn Maxwell joined in the debate after Tuesday’s howler, backing a return to that style of system.“We get that umpiring isn’t easy!!” he posted on Twitter. “But surely with a stump mic, a bunch of different camera angles, and a basic understanding of cricket, the right decision could’ve been made without any of the fancy DRS bells and whistles?“It was introduced to eliminate the howler.”Tye was fuming when the decision was given not out, and was left more upset when the umpire explained he thought Khawaja’s bat hit the ground. “How did the bat hit the ground? It was that far off the ground!,” Tye said.Tye’s Perth teammate, Kiwi international Colin Munro, said he heard the edge from near the boundary where he was fielding. “I’ve got to really have my ears open at home to hear the Mrs talk to me, but I actually heard that from the boundary at backward square- leg,” Munro said on Fox Cricket. Last weekend Thunder captain Callum Ferguson said the BBL would fall behind rival T20 tournaments if the DRS was not introduced.“We certainly like to think we’re in the top couple of T20 tournaments around the world,” Ferguson told the ABC. “But on the basis of not having little things like DRS in the place, I feel like we’re falling behind certainly the IPL. “If we’re trying to be as good as we possibly can be, we’ve got to have little things like DRS in.”

Montserrat Parello lost her husband eight years ago, and Christmas gatherings with children and grandchildren had helped her deal with her loneliness. But this year, the 83-year-old will be alone for the holiday at her home in Barcelona, due to the risk of infection from the coronavirus.
 "In these days of pandemic, I feel loneliness and anger," Parello said, expressing fears that "I will leave this life devoid of affection, of warmth."
 All most people wanted for Christmas after this year of pandemic uncertainty and chaos was some cheer and togetherness. Instead many are heading into a season of isolation, grieving lost loved ones, worried about their jobs or confronting the fear of a new potentially more contagious virus variant.
 Residents of London and surrounding areas can't see people outside their households. Peruvians won't be allowed to drive their cars over Christmas and New Year to discourage visits even with nearby family and friends. South Africans won't be able to go to the beach on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day or New Year's Day.
 The patchwork of restrictions being imposed by local and national governments across the world varies widely -- but few holiday seasons will look normal this year.
 People the world over are facing wrenching decisions -- to see isolated elderly relatives despite the risk or to miss one of the potentially few Christmases left in the hopes of spending the holiday together next year.
 The United States has not issued nationwide travel restrictions, leaving that decision to state governments, but a federal agency is advising people to stay home.
 Michelle Dallaire, 50, an attorney in Idlewild, Michigan, said this would be her first Christmas away from her father, who lives in northern Virginia. They've always gotten together with family for the holidays but decided it wasn't worth the risk this year.
 "It's sad, but better than never seeing him again," said Dallaire, who has health issues that also make her particularly vulnerable to the virus.
 In Brazil, which has the world's second-highest virus death toll after the United States, Francisco Paulo made a similar decision to skip a visit to his elderly mother in Sao Jose do Belmonte, in Pernambuco state. The 53-year-old doorman will work the holiday instead at a building in Sao Paulo.
 "Now I'm hoping to drive there (to Pernambuco) in May, and crossing my fingers that she'll be vaccinated by then," Paulo said. "It isn't a happy Christmas, but at least I'm healthy and so are all the people I love."
 The virus has been blamed for more than 1.7 million deaths worldwide, and many are still grieving -- or worried about loved ones in hospitals or nursing homes as the virus surges anew. But some who have survived sickness -- and everything else that 2020 has thrown at them -- are looking to rejoice.
 Dr. Elisaveta Tomova, an anesthesiologist in North Macedonia, is exhausted after months of helping women with the virus give birth and caring for her 26-year-old son, who became infected himself.
 "I have faced a nine-headed monster, and my son and I have beat it," the 54-year-old said. "All I need now is my family to be around me, to celebrate in silence and to fill my heart with joy."
 Many people head into the holidays facing financial uncertainty after lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus have decimated economies.
 Matteo Zega, a 25-year-old Italian chef who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants, lost a job offer in France when bars and restaurants there were ordered to remain closed until mid-January. He's hoping to start an internship in Copenhagen -- as long as restrictions don't scupper that plan, too.
 "It makes me stressed," Zega said. "But at the end of the day, I wouldn't complain when there are so many people suffering or dying. You can lose many things: jobs, money. But I'm here, I'm healthy."
 In recent weeks, many countries tightened restrictions in the hopes of bringing the spread of the virus under control so that the rules could be relaxed for Christmas. But that has not worked in many places.
 In Italy, which has Europe's highest confirmed death toll and where many have fallen into poverty following lockdowns, the government has imposed even more restrictions.
 The four nations of the U.K. - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have all ditched their original Christmas plans of a window to see family. Hopes that a vaccine could stop the spread were high just weeks ago when Britain was the first country to roll out a rigorously tested shot, but now an aura of dread hangs over the holiday as daily new infections soar.
 Adding to the gloom, a new variant of the virus is surging around London and its surrounding areas. Dozens of countries have banned travel from Britain in response.
 For Matt Balch, a 40-year-old Australian who lives outside London, the ability to ditch the Christmas plan came as almost a relief. Balch was set to go to his in-laws' home in Wales with wife, Kelly, and their two young children.
 "The prospect of being in a car for six hours each way with a 3-month-old and a 2-year-old filled me with dread," he said.
 But James Wren, who works in Hong Kong's finance industry, was downbeat about his change of plans. He was initially going to fly home to Ireland -- but the rapidly changing travel and quarantine policies, coupled with the uncertainty in the coronavirus situation both in Hong Kong and abroad, led him to cancel.
 "This is my first time ever not being with my family for Christmas, even though I have lived outside of Ireland for many years, so it was an extremely upsetting decision to make," he said.
 While many countries tightened restrictions, Lebanon, with the largest percentage of Christians in the Mideast, was actually easing them despite rapidly growing cases. It made that decision to boost an ailing economy and alleviate despair exacerbated by a devastating port explosion in Beirut in August.
 But even that provided no relief to some.
 "It will be a disaster after the holidays," said Diala Fares, 52. "People are acting like everything is normal, and our government doesn't care."
 Amid all the gloom, at least some children can rest assured that Santa Claus is still coming to town.
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infection disease specialist, said during a CNN special program with Sesame Street characters that he had been to the North Pole and vaccinated the man himself.
 "He is good to go," Fauci said.

Fred Gaudelli wasn't worried if NBC could successfully air "Sunday Night Football" games in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. His bigger concern was if the NFL could make it through the season.
 So far, both things have happened.
 Even though games may look the same, most of the processes around broadcasting the games have changed. Interviews for pregame features are being done remotely, announcers are socially distanced while being separated by plexiglass, and sideline reporters are in the stands.
 "I went into the season with no expectations. When I left Kansas City (after the opening game on Sept. 10) I wondered if we would make it back there for Week 13 (a Sunday night game against Denver on Dec. 6) and we did," said Gaudelli, the executive producer of NBC's NFL coverage. "There are challenges every week, but we've had the wherewithal to do it."
 No one is complaining though, even when games have been moved. NBC was scheduled to broadcast Tampa Bay's game at Las Vegas on Oct. 25, but an outbreak of positive COVID tests among the Raiders caused the league to move Seattle's matchup at Arizona to the prime-time slot.
 In that case, diverting the production trucks for the four to five hour journey from Las Vegas to Glendale, Arizona, was easy. The Baltimore- Pittsburgh game was a little more difficult. The game, which was supposed to happen on Thanksgiving night, was rescheduled multiple times until it was played six days later.
 "The league wants the best games in the best windows. That part has felt like business as usual. There has been more communication about if we have the windows on certain days. All those things take a lot of time and conversation," Gaudelli said. "These are inconveniences though, and not hardships."
 The NFL remains the only major professional sport in North America in which network announcers and production crews have been at the stadiums for all games. The crews have been smaller compared to years past. NBC's "Sunday Night Football" usually had 120 production personnel along with local hires, but that is down to 90 this season.
 Most of the production people are still arriving on Thursday and Friday to begin setting up at stadiums. Announcers and producers -- who are used to the camaraderie of going to dinner and exchanging ideas throughout the weekend -- have to do it virtually.
 The biggest surprise is that new announcing teams have developed natural chemistry without preseason games or spending much time together.
 ESPN's Lisa Salters said she still hasn't spent much time with Steve Levy, Brian Griese and Lewis Riddick, who are in their first season doing "Monday Night Football." Salters said she met Griese before the Week 1 game between Denver and Tennessee when both arrived to the stadium at the same time.
 "I have not been in same room with the crew and yet we have put together a product that we are all proud of. It goes to the professionalism of everyone in the group," Salters said. "It is so odd that we all have not sat down and talked or had dinner, yet a natural chemistry is there."
 Charles Davis, who arrived at CBS from FOX during the offseason, talked weekly with Ian Eagle leading up to the opener. Davis, who said he usually tapped or nudged former partners when he had something to say, has had to find a new way to communicate with Eagle due to social distancing and plexiglass separating the two.
 "Thank goodness you can see through the plexiglass," Davis said. "The situation is still the same as any other team learning as you go along."
 The biggest in-game adjustments have been for reporters assigned to the sidelines. They are not allowed on the field this year and have had to gather their information from the first row of the stands, from an area that NFL has called the moat.
 Instead of being able to roam near bench areas to get information about in- game injuries or adjustments, reporters have been dependent more than usual on team public relations staffs.
 "That was the main thing I was concerned about at the beginning of the season, but the staffs have been outstanding in getting information to us right away. It wasn't always this timely before," Salters said.
 Those adjustments though haven't been as big as putting together pregame shows. The two or three features per week in which reporters or former players would go to the complex to interview coaches or players is all being done virtually.
 Michael Vick said he enjoyed traveling to do features for "Fox NFL Kickoff" because he could spend an hour or two with players and coaches, but they are still getting what they need under the current circumstances.
 "For the players, it is convenient for them. It's a cool way to reconnect. Sometimes people are not as comfortable doing things in person," Vick said.
 Production meetings with teams were usually done at team facilities or hotels, but they are all being done on Zoom. Davis said they are still getting the information they need for the broadcasts, but they miss out on trying to read facial expressions or body language during interviews.
 Even if there is a limited number of fans in the stands, Davis said it was better compared to empty stadiums because it was easier to pick up on the flows and emotion of the game.
 NBC's Mike Tirico compared doing games in empty stadiums to being in a huge, empty television studio.
 "Usually that energy is provided by the fans and it is the soundtrack of the event," he said. "I've heard it from the players as well and I concur that we all have to bring our own energy. I totally understand and get it because it is very different."
 Gaudelli said the most out of place he has felt in an empty stadium was late last month during Chicago's game at Green Bay.
 "That was the most surreal because you know what that stadium is like on a weekly basis," he said. "You know what it means to the community and not having fans there was eerie. It was tough."
 Even though everyone is hoping things return to normal next season, there still has been the satisfaction that the show has gone on. Ratings are likely to be down for the season -- they were off 7% at midseason -- but the prime- time ratings have rebounded.
 "I've been telling people that work is twice as hard, but I'm 10-times more appreciative of the chance to do it," Tirico said.

_C. lianingensis_ was found to be a burrower because of certain morphological characteristics. Its short but sturdy neck and forearms, along with a shovel- shaped snout and shoulder blades that were not too different from extant burrowing vertebrates like moles and rabbits, suggested it liked to hide out underground. Psittacosaur snouts were shaped more like a parrot’s beak than a shovel. While most parrots do not burrow — with the exception of one bizarre species from Chile and Argentina — it is not completely out of the question for a psitaccosaur. While some paleontologists argue that their forelimbs were too short for this behavior, there is also an argument that they could have used their hindlimbs.

_EntreSoños_ de Fran Sieira, compañía de danza con máis de vinte funcións e o espectáculo de danza máis programado a través da Rede Galega no ano 2019, pecha a súa xira 2020 na casa da cultura do Milladoiro esta tarde ás 20.30 horas. Farao co aforo COVID ao completo.
 _EntreSoños_ é unha obra de baile e música tradicional galega de 60 minutos de duración, cun elenco artístico de tres bailadores: Fran Sieira, Aida Tarrío e Xisco Feijoó, ao son do compositor e músico multidisciplinar Anxo Pintos. Todo isto está integrado nun marco escénico deseñado por Luis Perdiguero (iluminación) e Vanesa Hernández (DiiVANT) como escenógrafa, e dende unha visión contemporánea a través dos ollos do director artístico David Vilarinyo, que segundo Sieira, “sitúa a obra nun marco contemporáneo, rompendo pasos e estruturas tradicionais, abrindo a danza galega a un campo infinito de posibilidades”, explica.
 Fran Sieira é un bailador do concello de Ribeira que compaxina o labor como mestre de baile e música tradicional en diferentes colectivos da súa comunidade, co empresarial, a través da súa propia compañía profesional de danza (Fran Sieira, compañía de danza). _EntreSoños_ trátase do primeiro traballo da mesma e, en verbas de Sieira, é un espectáculo “que combina tradición e vangarda, con voces en directo, unha forte dramaturxia e todo a través do baile e a música tradicional como principal mecanismos de expresión”.
 A obra está causando unha gran expectación en todo tipo de públicos, con presentacións en Ourense, Ribadeo, Narón, Vilagarcía de Arousa, Santiago de Compostela, Carballo, Lugo, A Coruña, Ribeira, Arteixo, Vigo, O Barco, Monforte de Lemos, Cedeira e participaron no Festival Escena-Patrimonio 2019 na cidade de Toledo.
 En definitiva a compañía, como eles mesmos din, busca novas posibilidades para o baile tradicional de Galicia, estudando o movemento a través da danza galega e falando mediante a mesma. Isto, sumado á profesionalidade do elenco artístico, conseguiu que o espectáculo inagural acadase tanto éxito en toda a comunidade.

Overall, the presentation of _Nine Witches: Family Disruption_ consistently shines throughout. Its retro aesthetic is charming to look at and is complemented by an excellent soundtrack and clever, often amusing writing. It certainly doesn't overstay its welcome with its four to six-hour runtime, though its puzzle variety leaves something to be desired and its paranormal elements feel underused. The action sequences might be tiresome for some, but serve nicely to inject a change of pace once in a while. The story takes some interesting twists and turns, but the potential zombification of the entire world at the hands of the Nazis is always at the forefront. Immersion may have been sacrificed for humour in some places, but _Nine Witches_ is nevertheless an easy recommendation for adventure gamers that enjoy storytelling over challenging gameplay.

Sieckert has been on the Mesa County Search and Rescue Ground Team for 14 years and has seen the advantages the ATAK and goTennas systems provide in person.
 “When I first started, we might have an idea where the teams might be but it was a lot more difficult,” he said. “ATAK is a huge advantage. I have it on my phone and it can tell operations exactly where I’m at in the field. With 3-4 teams in the field, I can tell where everybody is at on my phone and it helps operations to track us.”
 The first time the equipment was used for a search and rescue mission was on April 14, 2019, when a 30-year-old hiker and his 4-year-old daughter were reported missing in the Red Canyon area of Colorado National Monument. Four field teams were given smartphones paired to goTennas. The system allowed the teams to maintain communication with command and share GPS coordinates for potential footprints of the lost hikers in an otherwise cellular-denied region, according to a case study on the technology.
 Other search and rescue teams, such as one in western Montana, have been able to stay connected in mountainous dead zone with the goTennas. While teams still need that cellphone ping to know exactly where a lost person is, coordinating where to go has been made a lot easier with the new equipment, software and technology.

The menu of Chicago Street Eatery is straightforward — three burgers: plain, cheese and double; a Philly sandwich with choice of steak or chicken; three salads; five wraps, including a gyro sandwich; and fries or tots. A variety of canned sodas make up the beverage choices.
 The wrap choices include beef or chicken shwarma ($7.99), which essentially is a meal rolled into a tortilla (flour, honey wheat and spinach tortillas are available), as onion, tomato, cheese, fries and tahini are wrapped up with the protein of choice.

And Martha, a dwarf miniature horse the size of a Golden Retriever, was found on Craigslist, advertised as a Christmas present. She was a 10-week-old foal, way too young to be separated from her mother. The genetic mutation caused her legs to be splay out from her chest and looked like she would never walk.
 These are some of the abused and neglected miniature horses that have found a safe haven at R&R Ranch in Chesterfield. This 30-acre wooded wonderland is home to 24 horses, including 17 miniatures, two miniature donkeys, three dwarfs and two full size horses, plus five dogs, one cat, five birds and a loveable four-pound bunny named Franklin who blends into a fluffy white rug on the marble floor.
 “R&R Ranch is a busy place. We don’t keep it to ourselves,” said Stacy Rolfe, the head wrangler, who never set out to run a mini-horse sanctuary. “We like to share our barn with our local community and with fans all around the world. Our barn is special because of our horses. It is a place where horses come, in many cases, from very broken backgrounds, and they are lifted up. We provide hope to the hopeless and they return our love in spades.”
 A black wrought iron gate embossed with the family namesake R&R welcomes visitors. The letters stand for the last names of Stacy (Rothberg) Rolfe and her husband Dave Rolfe, who built their dream home off Wildhorse Creek Road in 2015. Horses and dogs playfully chase each other in the paddock, and a sprawling Cape Cod style home matches a big white barn that is appointed with chandeliers, rich dark paneling and spacious stalls engraved with each horse’s name. Chloe’s VIP suite has padded flooring underneath piles of pine shavings to relieve her inflammatory foot condition.
 Both Parkway High School grads, the Rolfes have been married for 33 years and are parents to Spencer, 26, Belle, 25, and Oliver, 20. Belle, her mom’s sidekick, has long blonde hair that matches Martha’s mane blowing in the wind as they sprint down a long dirt road. They recently launched a podcast and co- authored a book, “Martha, the Perfectly Imperfect Little Horse.” Martha wore a garland of hydrangeas as flower girl at Belle’s wedding last summer that took place on the family homestead. The Rolfes may be empty nesters, but their house is full, and so is their heart.
 Dressed in a bright floral Lilly Pulitzer skort and muddy cowboy boots, Rolfe is a workhorse. Up at 5:30 a.m., she cleans stalls, feeds horses, administers medication and snuggles her fur babies. In her spare time, she teaches fitness classes at the Jewish Community Center and manages multiple social media platforms that document the equestrian escapades.
 “Our mission is to increase public awareness in miniature horses and educate people on the proper treatment and care required when owning one,” she explained. “Quite often, owners buy a miniature horse thinking they are cute and will be fun. However, there is an awful lot of work that goes into them, too, and that, along with their expenses, is what causes people to sell them, trade them, give them away or leave them completely abandoned and neglected.”
 When it comes to community outreach and education, there’s no horsing around. Rolfe leads hundreds of tours, helps scouts earn their pets merit badges and hosts many community events to spread awareness and share her blessings. As a board member of United Hebrew, she threw an outdoor fundraising gala at her home for 200 guests and continues to give back any chance she gets. During the pandemic, she started a weekly virtual children’s story time and reads aloud books about animals.

He said the difference between cell coverage from when he first started to now is night and day.
 “It used to be almost an act of God for AT&T or Verizon to give you a location,” he said. “Being able to get a ping on their phones and get a location on their phones has helped us a lot.”
 He felt the improvements have been most evident over the past half decade.
 “Now we can get a ping on their phone and get a location that’s pretty reliable,” he said. “Now we just need people to stay in one location, it makes it much easier to find them. We’ve been chasing people all night long because they kept moving around.”

I’ve learned that whatever the situation is and whatever you are feeling, it is ok. If you can’t get up today, it is ok. If you can’t eat, it is ok. If you need to sleep 16 hours, it is ok. Respecting your body and your needs instead of pushing it until it breaks is smarter in the long run.

It's fair to say in the 30 years that I have been hairdressing I have never seen the beauty business be so damaged as it has been by the pandemic. This coupled with not being able to plan because of the fear of more closures feels like we can't get ahead of this situation. Having just re-opened to be plunged back into an open ended period of not being able to work or connect with clients is incredibly hard. Our focus is to keep the morale of the team buoyant, because without them we don't have a business.
