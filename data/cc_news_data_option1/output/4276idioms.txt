District 11 Assemblymember Jim Frazier and Brentwood Vice Mayor Joel Bryant, who’s running for mayor in the upcoming election, have announced their support for consolidation of the East County Fire Protection District (ECCFPD) with the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District (ConFire).
 In separate statements, both officials say the move would provide improved fire and emergency services to the residents of far East County.
 “How to sufficiently upgrade fire service in Brentwood, Oakley, Discovery Bay and far East County has been a critical issue for a decade or more, and it’s our residents who continue to suffer,” said Frazier in a press release this week.
 According to supporters, consolidation would help provide the staffing necessary for the reopening of two fire stations in the district, with at least one in Brentwood, to help get to the additional three stations that are needed.
 “This is an opportunity to provide the people of Brentwood and far East County with the fire service we need and deserve,” Bryant said. “The two districts already provide mutual aid to each other, mainly with fire stations and personnel in Brentwood, Oakley, Discovery Bay and Antioch. I am currently working with Chief Brian Helmick and Board President Brian Oftedal of the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District to finalize a permanent solution, which provides sustainable fire protection and medical response for not only the families and businesses in Brentwood, but for the entire fire district that we are a part of.”
 Bryant added that in order to support consolidation, the proposal must be achieved without a tax increase to the residents of Brentwood or the rest of those in both fire districts. It must also provide better pay and benefits to the men and women firefighters of the ECCFPD.
 In light of the recent announcement that the financially challenged East County Fire Protection District is in a state of emergency, Frazier said that drastic times call for drastic measures adding that East County residents deserve ample fire service that only consolidation will bring.
 “Between the increasingly dangerous, life-threatening fire seasons, and the need for faster 911 emergency services, fire service in East County is at emergency proportions,” Frazier said.

Editor: I read your front page article about the allegations against Christina Dalton, candidate for the Liberty Union High School District Board disturbs me in that many people will believe its accusations without really considering its truthfulness. More importantly, what did Ms. Orozco and Ms. Sherrill fail to say?
 We know that Chantae Orozco refers to a test, probably covering one chapter. (Test vs Mid-term) We also know that lunch period consists of 50 minutes, not the 25 alleged. If she only had 25 minutes for the test, what happened to the other 25? Was she unwilling to stay after school and take the full 50 minutes? As for failing the test, was it due to a shortened test period or her failure to prepare? Many students tend to dismiss test preparation and then blame the teacher.
 Jasmine Sherrill, on the other hand, claims Ms. Dalton told her she would never graduate. Is it possible that Jasmine was underperforming in class and Ms. Dalton really say something like, “You will not graduate if you continue to make poor grades?” Algebra 1 must be learned before Algebra 2 can be understood. A good teacher prevents his/her students from setting themselves up for failure by blocking access to courses they will fail.
 Lastly, if these actions were considered so horrific, did either of the girls or their parents report these actions to the principal or school board? According to Ms. Dalton, in her 39 years of teaching, she has had no complaints. If these actions were not worthy of reporting, then why are they suddenly so terrible that Ms. Dalton should not be elected?
 It seems these are two disgruntled students who didn’t like their teacher. Every teacher has disgruntled students. The only question is whether the purported actions of Ms. Dalton, even if true, rise to the level that should disqualify her from being elected to the school board. I think not.

 “It's going to be a long tournament with some changes, but he's ready,” Smith said.
 Faria, who is the first Cumberland wrestler to compete at Super 32 in over a decade, heads into the event off the back of a pair of impressive performances in the last two months. In August, Faria competed at the NUWAY Summer Nationals and went 5-0 to claim the 167-pound title. He posted an impressive 8-6 sudden-victory win over Pennsylvania's Jackson Gray in the semifinals before pinning Aiden McCafferty in just 39 seconds in the final.
 Last month in Pennsylvania, Faria wrestled for New England Elite at the Olympic Club Folkstyle Duals. After two first-period pins in his first two matches, Faria posted the best win of his career against AJ Corrado, a returning Pennsylvania AA state finalist. In a defensive match, Faria posted a 2-0 victory over the nationally-ranked Corrado.
 Following an 8-7 win over Nate Stephenson, Faria dominated Team Nauman Gold's Grant McKay 9-3.
 McKay placed at the prestigious Beast of the East last December and went on to qualify for the Pennsylvania state tournament. Faria finished the tournament with an 8-0 win over Dax Hughes.
 Those victories certainly caught the attention of Division I college coaches, who can't be at meets or welcome perspective athletes to campus for official visits because the NCAA extended the dead recruiting period until 2021.
 Faria already has three schools interested in bringing him to campus next fall, but that number could increase if the former Clipper can earn a spot on the podium. Coventry All-America Joziah Fry placed seventh at 113 pounds at last year's event. Fry became the first Rhode Islander to place at the event in over a decade.
 The other Rhode Islanders headed to the tournament are Coventry's Aidan Robichaud and Ponaganset's Michael Joyce – a returning New England finalist, Jacob Joyce, Tim Cook and J'Mari Lowman.

 BEIJING, Oct 23 (Reuters) - China's top leaders will chart the country's economic course for 2021-2025 at a key meeting starting on Monday, seeking to balance growth and reforms to avoid stagnation amid an uncertain global outlook and deepening tensions with the United States.
 President Xi Jinping and members of the Central Committee, the largest of the ruling Communist Party's elite decision-making bodies, will meet on Oct. 26-29 behind closed doors to lay out the 14th five-year plan, a blueprint for economic and social development.
 The plan and its execution will be crucial for China to avoid the so-called "middle income" trap, policy insiders say, referring to the struggle of many economies to boost productivity and shift towards higher value-added industries.
 "Although the Chinese government has been calling for a transition in the development model for a number of years, we think the next five years will be particularly important, both politically and economically," Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note ahead of the plenum, the fifth meeting of the Central Committee since the 2017 party congress.
 Sustaining steady growth will be the priority, even as expectations grow that top leaders could announce fresh reforms to spur domestic demand, innovation and self-reliance under Xi's new "dual circulation" strategy, policy insiders said.
 Investors also will be closely watching to see if China moves to a more flexible economic growth target, after dropping it this year for the first time since 2002 due to the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis. Some analysts say dropping growth targets would reduce the country's reliance on debt-fueled stimulus and encourage more productive investment.
 China, where the COVID-19 outbreak first emerged, has mounted a robust economic rebound after quashing the domestic spread of the virus, but global prospects remain gloomy and the pandemic has added to tensions with the United States.
 "China's potential growth rate will slow further due to the aging population, weakening effects from investment in driving growth and diminishing dividends from globalisation," said Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications.
 "To reverse the slowdown, we need deep-rooted reforms."
 Policy sources have told Reuters that China's leaders are set to endorse a lower growth target compared with 2016-2020. Government think tanks and economists have made recommendations for average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets including "around 5%", 5-5.5% to 5-6%, the sources said.
 The plan to be discussed and approved by leaders next week is expected to be unveiled at the annual parliament meeting in early 2021.
 "We need to maintain a balance between development, stability, and risk prevention," said a policy insider. "Macro adjustments will be more difficult and this will present a test for policymakers."
 INWARD SHIFT
 Xi's strategy to guide the next phase of development, which points to an inward economic shift, has fanned calls by government advisers for reforms to unleash domestic growth drivers, including loosening curbs on residency and land rights and boosting household incomes.
 Speeding up reform of the household registration "hukou" system would enable migrant workers to enjoy more social welfare benefits, while land reform would enable farmers get a bigger share of the gains from land deals. Both measures would spur urbanisation and consumption.
 Expected moves to further free up interest rates and expand the role of capital markets would address distortions in credit allocation that see huge state banks lend to state companies while the private sector is often deprived of credit.
 Chinese leaders are also expected to discuss further plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions and ease reliance on imported technology, especially semiconductors, as Washington squeezes Chinese tech giants including Huawei Technologies Co and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.

TOKYO, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Japanese shares ticked up on Friday after signs of progress in U.S. stimulus talks helped Wall Street finish higher overnight, while some investors refrained from making big bets ahead of a string of earnings reports next week.
 The benchmark Nikkei share average rose 0.18% to 23,516.59, while the broader Topix gained 0.34% to 1,625.32. Both of the indexes posted weekly gains of more than 0.45%.
 Wall Street provided a strong lead as positive economic data and the prospect of more fiscal stimulus helped all three major U.S. stock indexes end higher on Thursday.

 Other companies that were seen as potential replacements, such as Kakaku.com Inc and Zozo Inc dropped more than 7% each.
 The largest percentage loser in the index was Hitachi Construction Machinery, plunging more than 16% after media reported Hitachi Ltd was considering a partial sale of its stake in the company.
 Shares of semiconductor firms Tokyo Electron and Advantest Corp lost 2.74% and 1.08%, respectively, tracking a 10% decline in Intel Corp's shares after it reported a slump in quarterly margins.

_This editorial first appeared in the Los Angeles Times. Guest editorials don’t necessarily reflect the Denton Record-Chronicle’s opinions._
 The internet has been a powerful source of innovation and opportunity in the half-century since the first electronic message was sent between experimental nodes at UCLA and Stanford. And in some industries, it remains a great equalizer — giving upstart creators and service providers the sort of access that used to be the exclusive province of big corporations.
 That’s why policymakers in the United States have been loath to intervene online, worried that any rules they set would be counterproductive or quickly rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of change. “Don’t regulate the internet” became a frequent rallying cry, and for the most part, lawmakers and governmental agencies handled the emerging online powerhouses with kid gloves.
 The gloves have now officially come off. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a much-anticipated lawsuit Tuesday accusing Google of abusing its dominant position in online search and advertising to cement its market power. The lawsuit, which was joined by 11 state attorneys general, is likely to be just the first in a salvo of antitrust cases, legislative proposals, rule-makings and other governmental initiatives to rein in Big Tech companies.
 We won’t prejudge the Justice Department’s allegations that Google unfairly blocked competitors and raised the cost of online advertising to the detriment of consumers across the country. But we can’t help but notice the similarities between the case against Google and the Justice Department’s successful antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in the late 1990s, when the software giant used its deals with computer manufacturers for the Windows operating system to impede competition in the emerging areas of web browsers and digital media players.
 According to the Justice Department’s complaint, Google has used exclusive contracts with manufacturers and mobile phone services to make sure Google would be the default search service on browsers and mobile devices, and to guarantee that its apps would be placed prominently on products’ screens. This conduct led it to control more than 90% of the searches, the complaint alleges, while also buttressing its dominant position in online advertising.
 Google defended its actions and argued that consumers are free to choose other services for their searches.
 Failing a negotiated settlement, the courts will ultimately decide whether Google’s behavior crossed the legal line. But with California and three dozen other states still investigating Google, there will almost certainly be more cases filed, just as there are more concerns about the company than the Justice Department addressed, including whether Google competes unfairly by favoring its own products (such as YouTube and Google Maps) in its search results, and whether Google inappropriately uses its advertising network to boost its own products by collecting data from consumers on competitors’ sites.
 The lesson of the Microsoft case that seems apt here is not that it’s illegal to be big and successful. It is that once a company reaches that pinnacle, the aggressive tactics it used to grow and succeed can no longer be used to maintain its dominance. Monopolies aren’t necessarily illegal — efforts to preserve them are.
 That’s why antitrust authorities at the state and federal level are also scrutinizing Facebook, which has a track record of trying to gobble up or crush companies that could compete with its social network, and Amazon, which has been accused of competing unfairly with the many small and midsize businesses that sell products and services through its platform. Apple has come under the microscope too even though its products aren’t the top sellers in any category; its critics say the company is extracting unfairly high fees from the companies that want to make and sell apps for Apple’s iPhones and iPads.
 And then there is the flak that Twitter, Facebook and YouTube (which, like Google, are owned by Alphabet) have taken for the way they limit what users can say or post on their platforms. No one would care about these companies’ policies if their platforms hadn’t grown to such an epic global scale. But they are such powerful amplifiers of speech that some Republicans want to regulate them to ensure that they don’t discriminate against content from conservatives, offering potentially damaging fixes to a dubious problem; and some Democrats want to regulate them to ensure that they aren’t filled with misinformation, a real dilemma that defies easy solutions.
 Meanwhile, California is leading the push by states to give consumers more control over the personal data that have become the internet’s unofficial currency. The more that consumers learn about how their data are being used online, the more demand there will be for stronger privacy protections.
 For Big Tech, it’s a reckoning that’s been a long time coming. The internet is still capable of supporting vigorous competition and a free-flowing exchange of ideas, and rapidly changing technology still has the potential to disrupt markets and topple once-dominant corporations. But as much as lawmakers and regulators need to keep those realities in mind, they also need to make sure dominant companies don’t leverage their power to choke off competition and leave consumers with too few good alternatives and too little innovation.

QUINCY — Quincy Public School Superintendent Roy Webb expects the district to make cuts to counter this year’s deficit budget.
 What he doesn’t expect is those cuts to be reductions in force, or cuts to the district’s current staff.
 “We want to make all our cuts through attrition and through retirement,” Webb said. “We’re going to have teachers leave to go other places. We’re going to have staff retire. When we have those opportunities, we may not be rehiring those positions.”
 Those decisions already are taking place in the district.
 When Quincy High School Assistant Principal Sarah Gass left at the end of the 2019-20 school year, that position was not rehired.
 “With everything going on and all the hard work administrators are doing, the high school administrative team is doing it with one less person,” Webb said. “That’s the type of effort we’re going to need to get through this.”
 Some paraeducator positions were not rehired for this school year, and also at the high school, a secretarial position was not filled.
 School districts counter deficits by boosting revenue or cutting costs — and 80% of district costs are salary and benefits.
 The projected $500,000 shortfall in the $66 million operating funds budget comes as the district faces rising costs to meet the state-mandated $15 minimum wage and $40,000 minimum teacher salary, cost of living adjustments for all products used by the district and a 10% increase in health insurance costs — the same issues highlighted in the district’s unsuccessful bid in March for a tax increase in the education fund.
 “We knew that this was going to be coming, but it came a little faster, accelerated a little bit by COVID,” Webb said.
 With the COVID-19 shutdown in the spring and the economy’s ongoing struggles, QPS saw its corporate personal property replacement tax revenue, paid to the district by the state based on a percentage of sales tax revenue, drop by nearly 50% in May compared to the previous year.
 Three key operating funds — education, operations and maintenance and transportation — share in the tax which is expected to drop by more than $600,000 this fiscal year, and the district’s revenue could change “based on how the pandemic progresses or regresses. Having to shut down restaurants and bars again would directly impact that tax,” QPS Chief of Business Operations Ryan Whicker said.
 The state pay mandates also will begin affecting more QPS staff members, Whicker said, and as those wages increase, it impacts the district’s bottom line.
 “We’ll certainly need to make some reductions,” Whicker said. “We’re always pretty cognizant of our spending. We’re just going to have to be moreso going forward to best position ourselves to weather any storm that comes at us.”
 At the same time, the pandemic highlighted social-emotional and academic needs of students.
 “Dealing with children of poverty, maintaining programs for high-achieving students, all of those things need revenue to improve or to sustain the great things we’re already doing,” Webb said. “Those needs didn’t get better because of the pandemic. They probably got a little worse.”
 A district-wide team, with input from the School Board and the community, will look at the financial issues with a goal of doing things “least impactful to children,” Webb said.
 Potential state budget cuts also will factor into the decisions.
 State lawmakers factored additional federal COVID-19 stimulus funding into the current budget, so “if they don’t get that from the federal government, the governor told us to expect a 5% cut in all departments. How that trickles down to us, we can’t say for sure, but it will probably be a cut this year if that stimulus doesn’t come through,” Webb said.
 School districts could face additional cuts if the income tax proposal on the Nov. 3 ballot doesn’t pass.
 “Those are two unknowns, but those will impact Quincy Public Schools,” Webb said.
 Putting another tax referendum before voters remains an option for the School Board.
 “They understand the economy of Quincy, the economy of Illinois and really the country has taken a step back and don’t want to do anything to further harm that,” Webb said. “It is an option they are considering and will probably do at some point.”
 But Webb said likely only an unexpected budget hit would force staff cuts beyond attrition.
 “The only thing that would force a reduction in force is if one of those things that we didn’t expect happened — like the state would reduce our evidence-based funding by 10% or the federal government would eliminate a grant, like a title grant,” Webb said. “I can never make guarantees that we would never do reductions in force, but I really don’t want to do it. My intent is not to do it.”

It’s a complete reversal from their previous games.
 After struggling to generate long-yardage plays during the first three weeks of the season, Lake Dallas had five plays against Lebanon Trail gain at least 20 yards. Senior quarterback Trevor Moon ran for gains of 36 and 22 yards on the game’s first drive and later completed a 38-yard pass to senior Hunter Markham. Junior back-up quarterback Brendan Sorsby connected with sophomore Aundre Minnifield on a 55-yard pass in the fourth quarter.
 For Lake Dallas (1-3 overall, 0-2 District 7-5A-Div. 2), the next step is to turn those chunk plays into touchdowns.
 “We’ve had a good week of practice,” Young said. “I definitely see that we’re getting better, especially offensively. Our younger guys, it hurt us not having spring football with these guys. But, I think that we’re getting better every week and I see the improvement this week in practice. I think that we’re going to play a good game Friday.”
 The Falcons will look to find the end zone more often – four touchdowns in their last three games – Friday against Liberty (3-1, 2-0) in what projects to be a shootout, at least on paper.
 One year removed from a 1-9 finish, the Redhawks are clicking on all cylinders. Led by a breakout performance by sophomore quarterback Keldric Luster, he finished with 319 yards passing, 266 rushing yards and seven total touchdowns in last week’s 58-51 win over Memorial.

CHIHUAHUA. El gobierno de México acordó pagar a Estados Unidos el agua correspondiente al ciclo 35 del Tratado de Aguas Internacionales de 1944 sin necesidad de extraer el líquido de la presa La Boquilla, lo cual mantiene un conflicto con agricultores de Chihuahua desde marzo pasado.


  México y EU firmaron el acuerdo a sólo tres días de que se venciera el plazo para el pago del agua, la cual será extraída de las presas internacionales Falcon y la Amistad, la cual está destinada para el huso de 13 municipios fronterizos donde viven 1.6 millones de personas.


  ▶️ Mantente informado en nuestro canal de Google Noticias


  Fue ayer, durante la conferencia mañanera del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, que se informó del acuerdo y agradeció al gobierno estadounidense por la comprensión ante la dificultad que enfrentaba nuestro país.


  El acta se firmó el miércoles por la noche en el Monumento Internacional 1, que marca la división entre Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, del lado mexicano y El Paso, Texas, en territorio estadounidense.


  Roberto Velasco Álvarez, director general para América del Norte de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores y encargado de firmar el convenio con EU, explicó que éste entró en vigor desde ese mismo día e incluye una cláusula humanitaria que compromete a EU a dotar de agua para consumo humano a nuestro país en caso de que se presente una sequía severa.


  Por su parte, la titular de la Comisión Nacional del Agua (Conagua), Blanca Jiménez, explicó que las 13 las ciudades fronterizas de Coahuila y Tamaulipas que dependen del agua de las presas La Amistad y Falcon, tienen garantizado el abasto por seis meses debido a las aportaciones de la presa El Granero de Chihuahua, así como de los embalses de El Cuchillo, en Nuevo León, y la presa Marte R. Gómez, en Tamaulipas.


  Añadió que el abasto de agua se podría extender hasta un año cuando se presenten las lluvias en la zona.


  Sin embargo, fue la propia Blanca Jiménez quien el pasado 1 de octubre calificó como inviable el pago del agua a EU con lo almacenado en las presas internacionales La Amistad y Falcon debido al riesgo que suponía dejar sin abasto a tres ciudades de Coahuila y 10 de Tamaulipas.

Young Nigerians like Olayinka, many born after the end of military rule in 1999, have poured onto the streets of Lagos and other cities in some of the biggest demonstrations of the country’s democratic era. The protests have been fueled by social media, and come after the Black Lives Matter movement in the U.S.


  What started out in anger against police actions has turned into a catch-all for everything that ails the country, from corruption and pandemic-driven economic distress to inequality and widespread insecurity. While unlikely to loosen President Muhammadu Buhari’s grip anytime soon, the protests increase political instability in the OPEC member country and threaten to weaken an already fragile economy, Africa’s biggest.


  "The protests have had some salutary effects, in terms of pushing the issue of police reform to the front burners of public discourse and government action,” said Nnamdi Obasi, a senior Nigeria adviser for the International Crisis Group. "Many protesters thought this a right moment to demand wider reforms in governance and security. The Buhari government needs to do more to show it understands the enormity of the challenge and is committed to the long haul.”


  The rallies were triggered on Oct. 5 by a video of an apparent killing of a man by the country’s much-hated Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). As many as 56 people have died during the unrest, according to Amnesty International, some allegedly shot dead by security forces. Lagos, a city of more than 20 million people, is under a round-the-clock curfew.


  Buhari, who came to power five years ago pledging police reform, this month promised to disband the notorious SARS unit, and his government apologized to the protesters. Neither of those actions has appeased the crowds gathering each evening in places such as Lekki, southeast of Lagos, where a toll gate and bridge lead to the islands where the country’s rich live. While the protests may continue for a while, analysts say Buhari’s government will quell them.


  "The focus is going to be on trying to suppress the movement,” said Adebayo Ademuwagun, an Lagos-based analyst for Songhai Advisory, a political risk firm. "This isn’t going to significantly alter the outlook for Nigeria’s political establishment.”


  For now, the crucial oil industry remains untouched. But many shops and businesses have shuttered, adding to the problems of an economy that was hard- hit even before Covid-19.


  Struggling to recover from its first recession in 25 years, Nigeria devalued the national currency, the naira, twice this year. Although incomes were hit hard by the pandemic, the government was forced to remove fuel subsidies and cracked down on food imports, boosting inflation to 13.7%, almost a three-year high. The unrest may have put paid to any hopes of a swift rebound.


  "This is a a setback,” said Yvonne Mhango, sub-Saharan African economist for Renaissance Capital. "The protests and the curfew imply a slowdown in economic activity.”


  The yield on Nigeria’s 2032 dollar bonds has climbed 46 basis points in the past three days to 8.36%.


  The economic fallout may exacerbate income gaps in what is a deeply unequal society. While half the population of about 200 million is officially classified as poor, Nigeria is home to Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, and many other billionaires.


  The protests highlight "the relentless resistance of vested interests that are as ingenious at hanging on to undeserved privilege as they are poor at delivering goods and services or any kind of effective or fair system of public administration,” said Antony Goldman, founder and head of Promedia Consulting, a political risk advisory firm.


  Nigerian protests have been quelled by the military in the past. In 2012 the army put down demonstrations over an earlier attempt to remove the fuel subsidy, and in the 1990s protests against military rulers Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha were crushed.


  And while the army has denied responsibility for the shootings this week, the claim is belied by amateur video recordings on social media.


  "It’s symbolic that it’s in this quest for justice against police brutality that you now have the true brutal nature of the Nigerian state on display,” said Idayat Hassan of Abuja-based Center for Democracy and Development.


  The shootings have been condemned at home and abroad. Democratic Party presidential candidate Joe Biden called for restraint, as did singer Beyonce. Others joining the chorus of voices against the government’s action were Nigerian pop star, Davido, and Nigerian British boxer, Anthony Joshua.


  The protests and the government’s response to it showcase the disconnect between citizens of Africa’s most populous country — whose average age is 18 — and their ruler, who is 77. Most protesters have only lived under democratic governments.


  The heavy handed response by the military is seen as a throwback to the era of military rule, undercutting Buhari’s efforts to distance himself from his past. He led a coup d’etat in 1983 and was Nigeria’s military ruler until 1985.


  While he ran for president in elections in 2003, 2007 and 2011 before winning in 2015, the crackdown is seen by many as a sign their leaders haven’t changed.


  "This government has just defined its legacy,” said Chioma Agwuegbo, a 34-year-old gender rights activist, who joined the protests in Abuja. "This is what he will be remembered for.”

As the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District (ECCFPD) and the City of Oakley traded punches, the city council once again deferred a decision on adopting new fire impact fees intended to help bring fire and emergency services in the city up to par.
 The council was scheduled to consider updates to the schedule for fire impact fees, the first such update in more than 30 years, during the Oct. 13 council meeting. Citing rapidly changing circumstances, the council instead delayed the discussion and set no firm date to bring the item back for consideration.
 “At this time, it is the request of both staff and I that this item be continued again,” said Derek Cole, Oakley city attorney. “But at this point, we’re not able to provide any date at which we believe this item can return. In our opinion, there’s a lot that we are going to have to discuss with the district.”
 Councilmember Claire Alaura pushed back against Cole’s request and argued that the item should appear on the agenda of either the Oct. 27 or Nov. 10 council meeting.
 “I don’t feel that pushing it out to the new year would do anybody any good,” said Alaura. “I really do feel a sense of urgency of trying to resolve this as soon as we can.”
 Despite Alaura’s protest, a motion put forth by Mayor Kevin Romick to continue the item indefinitely was unanimously approved by the council. However, the motion also requires the city staff and/or the city attorney to provide progress updates at each council meeting on their efforts to complete an analysis of the district’s recommendation.
 “The longer the delay is to upgrade the fees, fire protection is going to continue to degrade until it’s corrected,” said ECCFPD Fire Chief Brian Helmick. “We need to get them upgraded immediately. We’re going to the county on Nov. 3. We obviously got them through Brentwood. We need to seek and get resolution (in Oakley). It’s a very real problem.”
 Fire service impact fees are one-time assessments developers pay to offset the increased demand for fire and emergency services that result from new development. The use of fire service impact fees is restricted to capital expenditures like new fire stations, engines and tools.
 This is the second time the council has continued this action item. A staff report prepared by Cole for the Oct. 13 meeting included a recommendation that it be continued to the Oct. 27 council meeting, but two events spurred Cole to change his recommendation.
 The first was a 10-page letter sent by the ECCFPD Board of Directors to Oakley’s mayor and city council outlining a broad range of perceived deficiencies in the city’s collection of development-related fees.
 “The city’s practice of permitting additional development without ensuring that new development generates sufficient capital and operating revenue to mitigate the costs of increased demand for fire and medical emergency response and fire prevention services hinders the district’s ability to provide such services to the district’s 128,000 residents,” wrote Brian Oftedal, ECCFPD board president in the letter dated Oct. 8.
 The district’s letter prompted Romick to make a video statement that appeared on social media retorting some of the letter’s claims, and the district responded with a second letter to the council. Cole argued that the district’s letters added a new level of complexity to the city’s consideration of the new fire impact fees.
 “As you can see from just the most recent correspondence from the district, the district is raising all kinds of issues that go well above and beyond adopting a fee study, adopting a fee resolution and the administration agreement,” Cole said.
 The council also expressed concern over a letter received Oct. 13 from an attorney representing developers Discovery Builders and West Coast Home Builders, Inc., in which they contested the methodology used by the district in its impact fee study.
 Romick asserted that the same developers had expressed an intent to sue Brentwood after that city adopted the district’s fee study earlier this summer, and he asked Cole if Oakley could be similarly sued.
 “The fact that Discovery is likely to sue Brentwood over the very same fee study would make it reasonable for us, as we sit here today, to anticipate that if we adopt the fee study and a new fee structure for the fire facility fees, that we will also be subject to a lawsuit,” said Cole.
 During public comments, Vince Wells, president of the Professional Firefighters of Contra Costa County Local 1230, chastised the council for delaying acceptance of the revised impact fee schedule.
 “It’s disappointing to hear that there would be any efforts from the City of Oakley in any way to minimize the amount of money that gets to the fire district,” he said. “If you were five city council members that were dedicated to fire, there would never be any of these questions that come up. That’s what the community needs to be looking forward to a future city council, that fire suppression and fire service is a top priority. The excuses that we’re going to hear in the next couple weeks are because fire is not a priority.”

Los trabajos contra el riesgo de desprendimientos en la ladera comprendida entre la Montaña de La Altura y la zona de servicios portuarios de La Jurada habran concluido el proximo mes de noviembre, hecho que materializara el objetivo perseguido con este paquete de obras que ejecuta la Autoridad Portuaria tinerfeña y que arrancaron en julio del año pasado.
 Para el presidente de Puertos de Tenerife, Carlos Gonzalez, "los mas de tres millones de euros de inversion que han supuesto las obras ejecutadas dan idea de la envergadura de los trabajos con los que hemos conseguido reducir al minimo los desprendimientos que historicamente se venian produciendo en las laderas situadas junto a la carretera TF-11, entre Maria Jimenez y Cueva Bermeja, ademas de proteger la zona de servicios portuarios de este ultimo enclave".
 Gonzalez indico ayer que "solo resta la ejecucion del tratamiento de talud en la ladera de La Jurada, donde ya se han concluido los trabajos de canalizacion para las aguas pluviales, justo a tiempo para estar operativa en la nueva temporada de lluvias". Asi, a principios de la proxima semana se desarrollaran los ultimos vuelos de helicoptero que llevaran material de trabajo a lo alto de la ladera. Se preve, por tanto, que la obra concluya la segunda semana de noviembre.
 Cabe recordar que la via TF-11, que conecta Santa Cruz de Tenerife con el nucleo de San Andres y la playa de Las Teresitas, es la principal via de acceso a la capital tinerfeña desde el norte, con lo que soporta una fuerte intensidad de trafico que, segun los ultimos estudios realizados, llega a superar los diez mil vehiculos diarios de intensidad media.

Philadelphia, PA, October 23, 2020 --(PR.com)-- The Philadelphia-based company, Partnership to Prosperity (PTP), is leading the field in solving a real threat to the U.S. workforce: the failure to transition students into workforce-ready employees in the biopharmaceutical industry.      With employers reporting more than 60% of job placements are unprepared, job seekers are either left to sink or swim. More than 54% of college students take on debt to pay for their education, adding to the pressures to find a job, even if unprepared. The gap between the educator's curriculum and the employer's needs are expanding.      The Partnership to Prosperity consultative program works with employers that are having a hard time filling positions with the right level of experience, helps educators develop customized solutions to support a more targeted level of learning for students and guides job seekers to find the right combination of education and experience.      "The growth of the biopharmaceutical industry has outpaced the quality of job- ready candidates at all levels on the spectrum," said Bob Castellucci, founder of Partnership to Prosperity. "Both job seekers and employers are frustrated. Job seekers are spending time and money to get through schooling only to walk away with student loan debt and discover they do not have the right experience for the position. Even with a high unemployment rate, biopharmaceutical companies are struggling to find candidates with the experience needed to step into entry and mid-level positions. This is a real threat to the future of our country."      With a three-pronged approach, PTP works with employers to solve recruitment and placement problems, encourages educators to focus on experiential learning and workforce preparedness and empowers job seekers to chart professional development pathways.      "We're based in Philadelphia, which is a growing biopharmaceutical hub, but it also has the second-highest student loan debt in the country," said Castellucci. "That problem is mirrored throughout the major biopharm hubs around the country. The time is now for organizations to step back and evaluate what skills are needed at each position, and work with educators to make systemic change to provide those learnings and set graduates up for success. Without change, we're going to continue to see unprepared workers, employers struggling to fill roles quickly and the risk of low enrollment in higher or continuing education as the perceived value is lower."      As the founder of PTP, Castellucci has more than 40 years of experience in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, providing executive leadership at companies such as Merck, Watson Laboratories and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. PTP works directly with biopharmaceutical companies and educational organizations to close the gap on workforce issues.

“The 8.1 per cent sequential growth in constant currency terms came on the back of growth across all verticals, all geos and all account-sized based cuts for the firm,” Coforge Ltd Chief Executive Officer Sudhir Singh said.


  The sharp sequential increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), in order intake and order executable, is a testament to the tenacity of and the consistent execution delivered by Team Coforge despite the pandemic-induced headwinds, he added.


  “As organisations pivot towards data, cloud and AI-led transformation the space for innovative and agile service providers in the broader tech services sandbox continues to expand,” he said.

  “The order intake during the quarter was exceptionally strong, with two large deal wins. The fresh business of USD 201 million was secured during the quarter under review, which is higher on both q-o-q and y-o-y basis,” Coforge said.


  A total of 12 new clients were added during the quarter.

Courtney Fallon has made quite a career for herself in sports media. Now, the 2005 Winchester High grad is ready to take it to the next level.
 Fallon has worked for NFL Network, ESPN, 98.5 The Sports Hub and WEEI, among others. Fallon recently decided to part ways with WEEI in order to start her own podcast called Bad Signal, which is now two episodes in.
 Fallon has become a perfect role model for younger girls and women who want to try and make some noise in a male-dominated field, and she's known she's wanted to do it since she was young.
 "I think there was one definitive Sunday in October where I was 16 years old, and my family collectively decided that I would be a perfect fit as a sideline reporter of an NFL game, after admiring CBS sideline gal Bonnie Bernstein for weeks," she explained recently.
 "It was definitive in a way that really drove my love of sports and more specifically Boston sports to an extreme where I would listen to sports radio WEEI from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. at night, and decided to call in the station myself. At that time, not many 16-year-olds, nonetheless females were frequent callers to the station and I got a bunch of pushback. But eventually, I made it on the air to air out my 'hot takes' at the time, however carefully curated they were. I've never slowed down since."
 The decision to leave WEEI was not an easy one. For starters, finding any kind of steady job in a pandemic isn't easy. But, Fallon believes this new endeavor is worth the gamble.
 "I have an immense amount of gratitude for all of my colleagues at the station, but walking away was a decision I felt was timely and necessary right now," said Fallon. "It's such a difficult time for every American struggling for work and jobs, and for me, it was more about being given a medium to voice my opinions on the current events in Boston sports.
 "That wasn't available to me anymore because of pandemic restrictions and studio time. It's scary to take a leap of faith into the unknown, but the response already has been tremendous. I already know it was the right decision."
 It seems as if everyone has a podcast these days, whether it's well known as 'Bad Signal' or a couple of guys sitting in their basement having a few beers and talking sports. So, what is going to make Fallon's podcast so different?
 "There's very few female on-air voices that have a sports-driven agenda, and I plan to acknowledge those other women in the media that have strong opinions on the game," she explained. "It's amazing how much sports reporters have been forced to be multi-faceted, and wear many hats. It's not just print, or radio, it's live streams, it's question and answer, sit down interviews, short video clips. We have to do it all.
 "The Bad Signal podcast was created in a multi-platform setting. The audio is also video, and eventually, we'll be doing short segments, comedy rips, skits, fun on-location interviews. Anything in the creative realm is not out of the possibility. That's the beauty of being your own boss."
 After her days at Winchester High as a soccer and track athlete, Fallon went on to the University of Maryland, graduating in 2009. From her time in College Park, Maryland, to covering the NFL and various other professional sports, what advice would Fallon give the younger generation trying to break into such a tough business?
 "Be persistent, ask questions, and then when they answer, ask more questions," she said. "Make a fantastic first impression. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and be memorable. Build your network. Network, network and more networking. Those doors don't open themselves. Don't get frustrated and compare yourself to another (entity) that's suddenly become more successful. Ignore the numbers on social media, focus on you and the content you're putting on display."
 Whether you're a Sachem parent with kids growing up looking for an example to follow, or, if you're a high-schooler unsure if the sports industry is for you, Fallon could be one you emulate as much as possible. She is eager to help the next generation of on-air journalists.
 "Don't be afraid of constructive criticism, send that email to your superiors, and have faith that you can manifest any career you want," she added. "On that note, shoot me a message if you'd like: courtney@badsignalpod.com. It's my goal in my career right now to give back and teach, be compassionate towards the next generation, because that was a gift I was lucky enough to be granted so early in my journey."

"Several states where the foreclosure flow was not so dammed up last year could see a roller-coaster pattern in foreclosure activity going forward because of recent legislation or court rulings that substantively change the rules to properly foreclose. A backlog of delayed foreclosures will likely build up in those states as lenders adjust to the new rules, with many of those delayed foreclosures eventually hitting down the road."

The trophy will stay in storage, and there will be a blank left in the record book.
 A year unlike any other in the Clarence Cannon Conference will stay that way for eternity.
 Because of a decision made by the league’s athletic directors before the fall seasons began, Friday night’s undefeated showdown between the Palmyra and Centralia football teams won’t be considered the CCC championship tilt. Those eight ADs, with support from their superintendents, decided if the coronavirus pandemic forced teams to cancel games and leave an unbalanced schedule there would be no league champion crowned.
 So despite their on-field success and the fact both teams are two games clear of anyone else in the CCC in the loss column, neither Palmyra nor Centralia will be considered the champion no matter who wins.
 They can celebrate as champions. They just don’t get the trophy.
 While it makes sense to have placed such a caveat on the season before the first kickoff went into the air, it doesn’t make sense now.
 Palmyra, ranked No. 1 in Class 2, and Centralia, ranked No. 5 in Class 3, are both 7-0 overall and 4-0 in the CCC. Both had two conference games canceled because of COVID-19 quarantines by their opponents, yet they’ve beaten the same three teams — Monroe City, Clark County and Brookfield — genuinely considered to be the others in the title chase.
 The only team with a .500 or better record to face only one of the top top teams was Highland, which is 3-3 with a 47-6 loss to Palmyra and all three of its losses in CCC play. Could the Cougars potentially have upset Centralia? Sure, but based on all other results, it’s highly unlikely.
 These two teams have earned the right to play for a championship. Isn’t that what every athlete wants?
 You can talk about the love of the game, the inspiration of competition and the thrill of victory, but you play an entire season to win a championship. That’s the goal. Always has been, always will be.
 Circumstances beyond the control of the players and the coaches have dictated neither team can achieve that goal Friday night. At a time when so much is being taken away and the fight for normalcy and opportunity is widespread, why deny either team a championship? Celebrate it. Embrace it. Remind everyone it’s possible to navigate turbulent times and still come out on top.
 Putting the CCC title on the shelf doesn’t change the magnitude of this game.
 It will have a playoff atmosphere with playoff intensity. District playoffs begin in one week, and this game will tell Palmyra and Centralia how prepared they are for what lies ahead. Winning games like this are what separates the state title contenders from the also-rans. There is plenty to be gained just by playing the game, but more can be gained by playing a game when the stakes are raised.
 The CCC leadership might not formally consider it such, but the stakes are high.
 The only team still undefeated at the end of Friday night can call itself a champion.
 There will be no trophy and nothing to denote it in the CCC record book, but in the years to come, when they gather for reunions or to watch their sons play, the players will know who won, how they won and why they won.
 They will be remembered as the champions without a championship.

CHIHUAHUA. El gobierno de México acordó pagar a Estados Unidos el agua correspondiente al ciclo 35 del Tratado de Aguas Internacionales de 1944 sin necesidad de extraer el líquido de la presa La Boquilla, lo cual mantiene un conflicto con agricultores de Chihuahua desde marzo pasado.
 México y EU firmaron el acuerdo a sólo tres días de que se venciera el plazo para el pago del agua, la cual será extraída de las presas internacionales Falcon y la Amistad, la cual está destinada para el huso de 13 municipios fronterizos donde viven 1.6 millones de personas.
 ▶️ Mantente informado en nuestro canal de Google Noticias
 Fue ayer, durante la conferencia mañanera del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, que se informó del acuerdo y agradeció al gobierno estadounidense por la comprensión ante la dificultad que enfrentaba nuestro país.
 El acta se firmó el miércoles por la noche en el Monumento Internacional 1, que marca la división entre Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, del lado mexicano y El Paso, Texas, en territorio estadounidense.
 Roberto Velasco Álvarez, director general para América del Norte de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores y encargado de firmar el convenio con EU, explicó que éste entró en vigor desde ese mismo día e incluye una cláusula humanitaria que compromete a EU a dotar de agua para consumo humano a nuestro país en caso de que se presente una sequía severa.
 Por su parte, la titular de la Comisión Nacional del Agua (Conagua), Blanca Jiménez, explicó que las 13 las ciudades fronterizas de Coahuila y Tamaulipas que dependen del agua de las presas La Amistad y Falcon, tienen garantizado el abasto por seis meses debido a las aportaciones de la presa El Granero de Chihuahua, así como de los embalses de El Cuchillo, en Nuevo León, y la presa Marte R. Gómez, en Tamaulipas.
 Añadió que el abasto de agua se podría extender hasta un año cuando se presenten las lluvias en la zona.
 Sin embargo, fue la propia Blanca Jiménez quien el pasado 1 de octubre calificó como inviable el pago del agua a EU con lo almacenado en las presas internacionales La Amistad y Falcon debido al riesgo que suponía dejar sin abasto a tres ciudades de Coahuila y 10 de Tamaulipas.
