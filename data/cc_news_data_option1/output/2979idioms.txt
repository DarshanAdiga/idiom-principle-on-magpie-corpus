VANCOUVER - Mara Soriano has spent the last four days checking the alleys and dumpsters of Vancouver's West End, putting up posters and answering multitudes of emails and tweets, hoping she'd find a stolen teddy bear that carries her late mother's voice.

The NBA painted “Black Lives Matter” on courts at Walt Disney World for the basketball season's restart and allowed players to replace the names on the back of their jerseys with references to racial injustice. Major League Baseball inverted its initials on the field to read “BLM” for Black Lives Matter last week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

We know that, across the 7,515 UK practices employing 37,075 architects (according to ARB figures), approximately 80% of the four in five practices who qualify for the scheme aren’t claiming. This is money that is going down the drain rather than being re-invested in staff, training and new projects. In some cases, larger firms will be passing up hundreds of thousands of pounds every year. Once the claiming deadline passes, that money cannot be recovered.

There is huge confusion out there about the accessibility of this scheme. It’s a specialist area and accountants, understandably, can’t always know every bit of tax law inside out. The key thing to understand is that HMRC’s R&D tax credit scheme rewards companies whose work seeks to resolve a ‘scientific or technological uncertainty’. This can take the form of a new process, product or service, or simply be an improvement to an existing one. It’s a definition that fits hand in glove with much of the problem solving that architects must grapple with.

Long before “shelter in place” was an everyday term, Aaron Loden was doing it.


  Not because it was mandated, or even recommended. Loden just preferred it.


  “I make a trip to town once a week or so for necessities, and that’s about it,” he said, poised against a fence rail. “It’s peaceful here.”


  And undeniably easy to get used to.


  Loden’s winding gravel driveway leads to his haven, Big Oak Farms, where he raises and sells Thoroughbred horses. Bordering trees separate the sprawling green pastures from the outside world.


  It’s been a four-decade-long labor of love for the former Itawamba County Tax Collector, who retreated to this haven after his so-called retirement. Working on the farm was not just his priority, but his passion.


  “Actually, I retired and went to work,” he said with a laugh. He motioned toward the few thousand feet of fencing he and his assistant manager, Garrett Beyer just rebuilt.


  “It’s hard work,” he said, “but I enjoy it.”


  Neither owning horses nor a Thoroughbred farm was on his mind as a youngster, but he can trace his fascination with the animals to a single life-altering moment.


  “I had never thought about it until the 1970s when I was a young man in the Army and stationed in Arlington, Virginia,” he said. “A few fellow soldiers invited me to go with them to a horse race, and that was all it took. I was hooked, and I knew this is what I wanted to do.”


  Although the beginnings of Big Oak are recorded as 1984, Loden says he started 40 years ago, in 1980, with Quarter Horses.


  Since then, his passion has become a full-time business.


  “I’ve sold hundreds of horses through the years, many hundreds,” he said, shaking his head in confirmation. “I try to buy around 35 a year.”


  On any given day, there are as few as two or as many as 30-something long- legged equines roaming the 40 acres of paddocks on Big Oaks Farms. Each enclosed section of black wooden fencing has a shed for the horses to cool off on a sweltering summer day or to take shelter during foul weather.


  Loden picks his yearlings in September and purchases his weanlings in November and January. He buys many of them in Kentucky, the heart of horse racing country.


  “Pedigree matters, especially if it’s a Kentucky Derby horse,” he said. “I always try to buy good bloodlines. That’s what sells.”


  When it comes to his pick of pedigree, Loden prefers to buy from Candy Ride’s family tree, the Argentinian born racehorse that went undefeated in six starts in both Argentina and the United States.


  He currently has six horses on his farm, two in Kentucky, one in Arkansas and two in Texas.


  One dark bay beauty roaming Big Oak is the colt of royally-bred Bayern, who dominated the G1 Haskell Invitational, G2 Pennsylvania Derby, and ended his campaign with a victory in the $5-million G Breeder’s Cup Classic.


  Another is the colt of Awesome Again and Alisa’s Catch. With a white diamond on his forehead, the dark-maned future-winner galloped along a beaten pasture path. He’s in the lineage of a sire who claims 14 Grade 1 winners, 13 millionaires, four Breeders’ Cup Champions and five multi-millionaires in his line. The intelligent and athletic colt’s progeny sold for $1.4 million. His price tag is $25,000.


  “The internet has opened up the world to selling,” Loden said. “I’ve recently gotten calls from California, Florida and the Philippines.”


  Buyers purchase horses sight unseen. His website www.bigoakfarms.net, gives the would-be owners complete pedigrees along with photos and training videos.


  Three of Big Oaks Farm’s horses have shipped to Dubai. The near 8,000-mile journey takes about 22 hours of flight. The price tag to get a horse from Big Oak to the middle east runs in the neighborhood of $16,000 he’s been told by buyers.


  Occasionally, Loden travels to a race to watch the farm’s former residents compete. Two years ago, he journeyed to Saratoga, New York, with friends to watch Trigger Warning, a former occupant of the farm, race. The horse had netted its owner $550,000 in winnings before a broken leg ended his career.


  “I’ve traveled to the Arkansas Derby from time to time,” Loden said. “But most of the time, I’m watching races on television and working on the farm.”


  Loden said it’s hard to tell how the current conditions with the pandemic will affect the Thoroughbred market and horse racing. He saw many farms go under 15 years ago or so during the economic downturn.


  “It’s hard to say. I guess only time will tell,” he said, looking across the green pastures.


  Until then, he’ll keep mending fences at Big Oak Farms and finding quiet contentment in watching potential champions gallop by.

Apple has faced increasing antitrust concerns in recent months about its App Store practices, with the European Union recently launching an investigation into the digital store and the US Department of Justice rumored to be weighing similar action.


  Amazon has its namesake mammoth e-commerce presence and manufactures its own goods, some of which compete with those from other sellers in its online store. This potential additional data that Amazon has access to came under fire after a Wall Street Journal report detailed how Amazon used such data to help it set pricing, determine which features to incorporate and decide whether it was even worth getting involved in a product category.


  After the Journal story came out, the House called for Bezos to testify.


  Google and Facebook, in addition to running the country's most popular search engine and social network, respectively, dominate the bulk of the digital advertising market.


  Google has been under increased antitrust scrutiny by states around the country over its ad business, with the DOJ expected to file its own lawsuit this summer.


  Facebook revealed last year that the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into the company's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp and whether they were made to stifle competition. Beyond Zuckerberg appearing before Congress, he and COO Sheryl Sandberg could be deposed by the FTC as part of its investigation.

Here's how it all works - and why their unusual reproduction strategy might be a key to controlling tsetse flies and the parasite they carry once and for all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam) has announced that its exploration of the Ken Bau-2X well, located in the Red River Basin offshore of Vietnam’s northern continental shelf, helped the firm fulfil its plan of increasing oil and gas reserves in 2020 ahead of schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Del Merritt, owner of Hermon's Speedway 95, said they were able to get 161 spectators into the grandstands for last Saturday night's auto race card after Maine Governor Janet Mills eased the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on the state's four tracks.


  Tracks are now allowed to have as many as 200 spectators in the grandstands after several weeks without fans.


  Speedway 95 can hold 3,000 in its grandstands, so 200 represents just 6.7 percent of capacity.


  "But 200 is better than nothing," Merritt said. "We had to jump through hoops to get it."


  "It's something," agreed Andy Cusack, the owner of Beech Ridge Motor Speedway in Scarborough.


  The track owners didn't learn until late in the week that the spectator ban in the grandstands would be lifted to allow 200, so Cusack and Oxford Plains Motor Speedway owner Tom Maybury decided not to scramble around at the last minute to put people in the grandstand seats.


  "We only had 24 hours to sell tickets so we did well to get 161," Merritt said.


  The tickets cost $15 apiece, producing $2,415 to help defray the costs of driver payouts and other expenses such as lighting, ambulance service, insurance, wrecker, employees wages and more.


  Speedway 95 has already run four Wacky Wednesday race cards and three Saturday night events. This Wednesday will be the first time there will be fans in the grandstands for Wacky Wednesday racing.


  Beech Ridge Motor Speedway won't be racing this weekend because the Foxwoods Resort Casino 301 NASCAR Cup Series race is being held at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in Loudon on Sunday afternoon.


  Cusack has already had two Saturday night race dates without fans, but said Beech Ridge will have its grandstand open for 200 spectators on Aug. 8 when its weekly racing series resumes.


  In order to save money, Cusack decided to combine his Thursday Thunder and Saturday NASCAR Nite race divisions into one Saturday race card. Racing will begin at 3 p.m.


  "By consolidating and racing on one day instead of two, especially with the restrictions, you cut some of the expenses like insurance, security, staffing," Cusack said.


  And by racing in the afternoon, it saves him a hefty lighting bill.


  He said the car counts have been "steady" but admitted that they would probably have double the car counts for his Thursday Thunder classes if they raced on Thursday.


  "A lot of our drivers race on Thursday because they can't race on Saturday due to work or family obligations," Cusack said.


  An Oxford Plains Speedway spokesperson said she doesn't know if they have decided to have fans in the grandstands when they race again on Saturday. The Oxford Accelerated Series races beginning at noon and its Oxford Championship Series classes starting at 5 p.m.


  Oxford Plains Speedway has been holding its series races since June 27.


  Wiscasset Speedway owners Richard and Vanessa Jordan decided not to open until spectators were allowed in the grandstands, so they will be the last track to drop the green flag when they open for the season this Saturday at 6 p.m.


  Cusack said allowing fans in the grandstands won't make a major difference financially because children 12 and under get in free. It is $12 for adults.


  Speedway 95 charges $15 for all ages on Saturdays and $10 on Wednesday night. It used to allow children to attend for free but Merritt said with only 200 seats available, they have no choice but to charge for all seats.


  There will be strict guidelines, including allowing just 50 people in four different sections of the grandstands.


  Social distancing protocols must be adhered to and each track has its own standards.


  For example, Speedway 95 is using portable toilets rather than restrooms and there aren't any concessions in the grandstands area. Fans are encouraged to bring their own food.


  Cusack said Beech Ridge has enough room to keep its restrooms and concession stands safely open.


  Tickets for Speedway 95 must be ordered online, but Beech Ridge spectators will be able to purchase tickets at the gate.

Clearly this is a fraught moment. Parents are reeling, students are waiting, and school districts are punting. Everything is up for grabs, including whether there's about to be a giant teachers strike. But no matter what happens, this is going to be a year of educational changes, pods, no pods, or, given how things have been going, maybe even Tide Pods.

The EC Chairperson, Jean Mensa, announced that the policy forms part of the “safety protocols for curbing the spread of the coronavirus” adding that, “the nomination forms will be made available on our website and so candidates no longer have to come to pick up their forms at our offices before filing”.      Speaking in an interview with GhanaWeb, Evans Nimako, noted that it was a step in the right direction considering the surge in Coronavirus cases. He has, therefore, called on all stakeholders to get on board to ensure a smooth process in the upcoming elections.      “Any arrangement that will ensure that we have an effective and organized order is welcomed… continuous interactions possess high risk (COVID-19). The EC does not want to give any prospective aspirant any trouble so they say go online to fill and submit your forms and all other discussions will follow. We think that it is an innovation that must be supported by all stakeholders," said Evans Nimako in an interview with GhanaWeb on July 29, 2020.

I’ve been asked by several of you to catch you up on the chickens and ducks so here goes …


  If you didn’t already know, we had 15 chickens from spring 2019: 13 hens and two roos. They’re a mixed lot of Comets, Isa’s, Australorps, and Silkies. The two roos, named Goldie and Blue, are Silkies.


  We also got three Pekin ducklings last spring. All was well until we put the ducks outside and one disappeared the first week. Afterward we started herding them into the goat pasture at night, and we still have the two, Daffy and Daisy.


  Daffy and Daisy love water. They have tubs that they get in and splash like kids. Problem is, we have a big pond, and those two girls wanted nothing to do with it! They eventually got where they’d waddle down to the edge and “shovel- bill” in the mud, then they’d run like they were being chased back up to their beloved tub!


  Egg laying began last fall and we’ve gotten enough eggs each week to share.


  Fall and winter went peacefully in the henhouse, except when Goldie and Blue began to understand they were boys and they both wanted to be in charge. Now, Silkie roos don’t fight like other roos. They “gentleman fight,” which means it never gets ugly, so the daily agreement over dominance usually ended with Blue running off.


  Fast forward to this February. Once again we were in the baby business. We got nine what were supposed to be pullets (that means they were all girls), and all bantams. One of them had been injured and she was given to us. We also got four ducklings, and our basement turned into a brooder again. Right off, we lost three tiny chicks. Don’t know why. So we’re down to five.


  Things proceeded as expected, with lots of litter changes and water fills. We got lucky and a very dear friend and neighbor, Laurie, fell in love with the critters too. Boy, she’s been amazing with all the daily attention to all our animals! She’s the “snack lady.” Anyway, one morning I was on my way to begin mucking duties and I heard a very distinct juvenile yodel/crow.


  No way! They’re girls!


  Like it or not we had a roo. He was tiny and feisty, and was the first one to figure out how to fly straight up, out of the box. So, ok, we’re down to four hens. I guess we can live with that.


  Then once again I was on my way to tend them and a different voice — it sorta sounded like a strangling peacock — that was definitely a boy.


  Good grief! Two more roos?! Someone will have to go!


  We had noticed chicken coops in a yard down the road from us, and one evening we pulled into the drive. After introducing ourselves and assuring her we weren’t there to sell anything, we started talking about chickens. I asked her if she knew anyone who might need a couple roos. Lo and behold, she did! Goldie and the first lil new crower were adopted, plus she found a home for Hoppy, the little crippled hen.


  I felt like things were leveling out. We were back to two roos and, now, three hens. All Silkies, which are cute, but not very dependable layers.


  The ducks and chicks graduated to the pasture and henhouse and we cleaned up the basement mess. We were glad that was done! In my barnyard duties I began to notice something. We’d assumed that the four ducks, one mallard and three khaki Campbells, were hens. At least that’s what we hoped. I noticed a curled tail feather on three backs. No way! And those three Silkie hens? One of them was getting a comb, wattle and coloring of ... _a roo!_ No crowing yet, but I knew.


  Dang! Too many boys around!


  Well, in the last two weeks Blue and the young white roo have died, separately and of unknown causes. The Silkie roo has begun crowing, and we’re down to two new hens out of 9! The three drakes are wearing my Pekins out and have seriously interrupted egg production. I’m gonna have to catch two and send them packing. The good thing is the Pekins have finally learned how to swim in the big pond.


  Next time ... I don’t know if there’ll be a next time!

Black and blue flag: What the press is talking about on July 26

Bianca Padilla, the CEO and co-founder of Carewell, one of the Primetime fund's first portfolio companies, is trying to change that.


  She and her co-founder husband, Jonathan Magolnik, Carewell's COO, launched a marketplace for caregivers looking for home healthcare products and personalized support in 2017.


  Padilla, who grew up in a multigenerational Hispanic household, told Business Insider that the idea behind Carewell was inspired by watching her own mother serve as a caregiver to her grandparents. The CEO said that her mother struggled to find product names that no one in their family had ever heard of.


  Watching a loved one receive a diagnosis like Alzheimer's can be overwhelming, but Padilla said that the experience of supporting a loved one could be made easier.


  "Family is at the heart of health," Padilla said in an interview with Business Insider. As a family-focused startup, Carewell is "building a brand around simplicity and putting things in layman's terms so that it doesn't seem so foreign and so scary," Padilla added.


  Patricof and Levy anticipate mostly funding startups launched by socially conscious young founders, but they're hoping to back older entrepreneurs, too. The VC team is looking to invest across a number of verticals, including healthcare services, healthtech, fintech, care coordination, preventative health, and consumer tech.


  ## A veteran investor's third act


  While Levy said she has hit the ground running in her new role as managing partner and advisor to the fund's portfolio companies, Patricof said he has been hesitant to assume his role as a spokesperson for people who are over 60.


  "I'm not excited about getting on the soapbox and saying to the world that I'm 85," he said. "But I thought about it, I've accepted it."

Wasn't that _fun_? I struggled a bit with the first season of _The Umbrella Academy_ , but as all those glowing reviews suggest, Season 2 is a marked improvement across the board. I'm so glad I decided to jump back in and give it another chance, and this sequence won me over right out of the gate. It's also indicative of one of the season's other strengths, which is that it's a soft reboot to a certain extent.

When she realized the little boy, who was only wearing a T-shirt and a diaper, was alone she walked through the neighbourhood searching for his parents. Then she called police.

As part of the “Safe Reopening Plan for Tennessee Schools,” Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee issued Executive Order No. 55 on Tuesday that allows the resumption of contact sports.


  The order means football and girls soccer teams can begin full contact under COVID-19 regulations set by the TSSAA Board of Control on July 22, which includes no scrimmages or jamborees. It also means girls soccer and football seasons can start on time with first soccer matches scheduled for Aug. 17 and first football games scheduled for Aug. 21.


  “(Greeneville football coach Eddie Spradlen) and I had talked just (Tuesday) about how we thought things may actually get pushed back, so the announcement today was a really big surprise to us,” said Greeneville athletic director Brad Woolsey. “On one hand, you’re thankful because maybe you can get back to some normalcy. At the same time, you’re still concerned about the virus and the levels that it’s at here in East Tennessee. It’s kind of a double-edged sword for me.


  “There’s still just a lot of unknowns, you know? I think that’s what we’ll have to cope with throughout the year, the continuous unknown of any day, any week things changing. … I was shocked today.”


  Prior to Gov. Lee’s announcement on Tuesday, contact sports were prohibited through Aug. 29 as part of Lee’s State of Emergency order, potentially pushing back the start of girls soccer and football seasons.


  “(Tuesday’s announcement) really knocked me off my feet,” Spradlen said. “I didn’t think there was any way we would play Aug. 21. It’s good news. The kids will be excited, which is always good. It’s an exciting time, but it’s a nerve-racking time at the same time.”


  Now that teams have been cleared for contact and for seasons to start on time, the risk of seasons being interrupted or cut short by COVID-19 outbreaks remains.


  Major League Baseball has suspended the Miami Marlins’ season through Sunday due to nearly 20 players and coaches testing positive for the virus.


  Some college football teams have also been hit by positive COVID-19 tests, some college conferences have postponed fall sports and some states have gone as far as moving high school fall sports to the winter and spring.


  Unlike professional and college teams, Tennessee High School teams don’t have funding for daily and weekly testing or around-the-clock world-class medical care, thus avoiding and controlling outbreaks could prove more challenging.


  Prior to high school teams opening their seasons, questions as to how teams distance athletes on buses, in locker rooms and on sidelines will need to be addressed. And, too, how many fans will be allowed into stadiums, how do you distance fans in the stands and at concessions stands?


  “I don’t know that there’s any question that there’s not going to be some COVID amongst our athletic teams, not just Greeneville, but talking about Northeast Tennessee,” Woolsey said. “To say it’s not going to happen probably really isn’t feasible.


  “For us, even though things are opened up in terms of contact sports, we want to continue to maintain and develop protocols and do as good as we can to keep our kids safe. There is no COVID-free environment. We can’t promise that.”


  Spradlen acknowledges controlling outbreaks might prove more difficult for high school teams.


  “Anything you do in life, you’re rolling the dice,” he said. “(My family) just drove to go fishing and to Chick-fil-A. You’re rolling the dice every time you do something. Some people aren’t going to be willing to take the chance. But I think most kids want normalcy back in their lives. Personally, I want it. My kids are dying to go back to school.


  “At the same time, you have to be cautious when you’re doing these things. You’re not going to drive down the road at a hundred miles an hour. You have to take precautions and help prevent the spread of the virus as best as you can.”


  Thus far, no one involved with the Greeneville football and girl soccer teams have had to be sent home due to the virus.


  “We’ve done a really good job, I feel like, of making sure we’re following the same procedures each day,” Spradlen said. “Our kids are parking different places, they check in different places for workouts. We’re doing a really good job of making sure we’re sanitizing stuff and trying to make sure we keep our social distancing. Any time we’re not training, we encourage our kids to have masks on.


  “We’ve always done a real good job of doing laundry, washing the kids’ stuff, cleaning their pads and equipment. We’ve got to do our part. We’ve got to stay on top of that stuff. We can’t be slack with any of that. If you don’t, you’ll set yourself up to have an outbreak.”


  Greeneville’s football team is slated to open its season at home against Powell on Aug. 21, while the girls soccer team is slated to open its season at Unicoi on Aug. 25.


  “We just all have to stay healthy,” said Greeneville soccer coach Jerry Graham. “Everybody’s got to do their part. We can do everything in the world as Greeneville High School, but if other people, other teams, other schools don’t react the same way, our season could be in danger again.


  “We have to keep the precautions our school system has already put in place and the ones the TSSAA put forth last week. We’re going to ease back into things. We’re going to still try to do it in the safest manner possible.”

According to the letter, “Given the significant scientific uncertainty about the overall risks and potential benefits of e-cigarette use in adults (and its known harms to the youth) and the evidence to date of the harmful effects of HTPs, every novel tobacco product including HTPs and ENDS should be banned in Nigeria while every new product should be subjected to thorough scrutiny by the Federal Ministry of Health and other relevant regulatory agencies in the country”.

Tariff liberalisation accompanied by a reduction in non-tariff barriers—such as quotas and rules of origin—would boost income by 2.4 percent, or about $153 billion.      The remainder—$292 billion—would come from trade-facilitation measures that reduce red tape, lower compliance costs for businesses engaged in trade, and make it easier for African businesses to integrate into global supply chains, the report said.      Successful implementation of AfCFTA would help cushion the negative effects of COVID-19 on economic growth by supporting regional trade and value chains through the reduction of trade costs.      In the longer term, AfCFTA would provide a path for integration and growth- enhancing reforms for African countries.

The WeMo app isn't my favorite for smart plugs. That title still goes to TP- Link's Kasa app, filled with customization options like device photos and useful features like scenes. What WeMo offers does get the job done for simple automation. You'll be able to set schedules for powering the plug on and off, as well as an Away Mode for automation lamps or TVs while you're away to simulate occupancy in your home.


  Overall, the WeMo Wi-Fi Smart Plug is a solid example of this kind of device. There are no big surprise features or exceptional luxuries, but you aren't paying a luxury price, either. The WeMo app leaves a little to be desired when it comes to extra features and intuitive design, but at just $25 (with a three-pack for $49), this tiny smart plug is space saving and well-equipped to bring your home's accessories online no matter the platform.

By replacing the patchwork of regional agreements, streamlining border procedures, and prioritising trade reforms, AfCFTA could help African countries increase their resiliency in the face of future economic shocks.      “The African Continental Free Trade Area has the potential to increase employment opportunities and incomes, helping to expand opportunities for all Africans,” said Albert Zeufack, the World Bank’s Chief Economist for Africa.      “The AfCFTA is expected to lift around 68 million people out of moderate poverty and make African countries more competitive. But its successful implementation will be key, including careful monitoring of impacts on all workers –women and men, skilled and unskilled—across all countries and sectors, ensuring the agreement’s full benefit.”      According to the report, the agreement would reshape markets and economies across the region, leading to the creation of new industries and the expansion of key sectors.

Here's how it all works - and why their unusual reproduction strategy might be a key to controlling tsetse flies and the parasite they carry once and for all.

Chris Young/The Canadian PressOntario Premier Doug Ford takes a question from the media during an announcement in Ajax, Ont., on July 28, 2020. Ford says Ontario has made "tremendous progress" fighting the novel coronavirus but "we are not out of the woods yet."
 TORONTO -- More businesses and public spaces in Toronto and nearby Peel Region will be able to reopen on Friday as those areas join most of Ontario in Stage 3 of the government's COVID-19 recovery plan.
 But the province says the Windsor-Essex region, which has been grappling with outbreaks on farms, will remain in Stage 2 for the time being.
 In a release issued Wednesday morning, the province says it will continue to monitor the situation in Windsor-Essex and provide assistance through measures such as on-farm testing.

We've come a long way, and WeMo's latest Wi-Fi smart plug proves it with a 45% smaller footprint than the WeMo Mini Smart Plug and a reasonable $25 price. It works with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and Siri for voice commands and smart home integration, and while it's not my top pick, it is a great option for nearly any smart home enthusiast.


  ## Design


  This is where WeMo gets it right. This smart plug is the smallest I've ever reviewed at 2.05 inches wide by 1.81 inches tall by 1.34 inches deep. It has a sensible rectangular shape that fits inside the profile of a standard outlet. WeMo didn't reinvent the wheel here, it just made it look better.

Ruling out a change of guard in the State, former Minister Murugesh Nirani on Wednesday said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will remain in the saddle for the next three years.


  Fielding reporters’ queries in Mysuru, Mr. Nirani, a BJP MLA from Bilgi in Bagalkot district, who was the Minister for Major Industries in the previous BJP government, said he had no information about the purpose behind Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi’s recent visit to the national capital. “But, I can clearly tell you that Mr. Yediyurappa will remain the Chief Minister for the next three years.”


  Mr. Nirani said he was in Mysuru in connection with extending invitations for the resumption of the Pandavapura sugar factory. “I am far away from politics. Ask me about sugar factories and I will answer.”


  Mr. Nirani said he had made it clear that he will remain in the BJP though the party did not field him in the last Assembly elections. “Even in the coming Cabinet expansion, I will become a Minister if I am given an opportunity. If not given, I will not be dissatisfied.”


  Asked about the speculation over Mr. Laxman Savadi’s visit and the speculation over the change of guard in the State, Mr. Nirani said he was too small a person to talk about a change of Chief Minister.

In comparison to F-35, experts said the Rafale jet is more agile as it has long-endurance to fly at a higher speed while carrying a range of weapons for a longer period of time. However, the F-35 scores much ahead of Rafales in terms of on board avionics and electronic warfare systems.

The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture’s Northeast Beef Expo for 2020 has been canceled. The event typically draws more than 400 people to the AgResearch and Education Center at Greeneville every October. Event organizers say the decision to cancel the Expo, which has occurred annually since 1989, was difficult.


  “This was a tough decision, but in light of current health concerns and the difficulty of social distancing and following CDC health guidelines with such a large group of participants, the committee felt this was the correct decision to protect the health and well-being of our clients and stakeholders,” says Justin McKinney, director of the AgResearch and Education Center at Greeneville.


  In-person Master Beef recertification, which is typically offered at the Beef Expo, will also not be available. Clients that need recertification will have the opportunity to participate in a four-night online training. For dates and registration for the online training, contact the UT Extension office in your county.


  For those uncomfortable with online training, some county Extension offices are planning in-person recertifications for later in the year, although this option may incur extra travel costs on the part of the producer. Contact your local UT Extension office for more details.


  McKinney says plans are to bring the Northeast Tennessee Beef Expo back in October 2021 with an expanded program.

In light of the corona pandemic and uncertainty regarding the profitability of parts of the business, we have initiated a cost savings program. Assessing all parts of the business, we have identified improvement areas that will contribute to the operating result of the business and will enable us to strengthen and accelerate the strategy execution throughout the Group. The program is expected to be executed over the next 12 months and based on our current assessment, the restructuring costs are estimated to be in the range of MSEK 350-500 and will be recognized over the course of the next 4 quarters as items affecting comparability. The payback period is about 2 years and the savings will have a positive impact starting in the fourth quarter 2020.

Herbert Adekah, owner of colts’ club Great Farcos which nurtured a lot of talents including the greatest Ghanaian footballer of all-time Abedi Pele revealed to Happy Sports in an interview that football has made him poorer.      He stated that he established the colts club in 1963 but hasn’t regretted investing in the club despite the numerous players he has produced but yet living in poverty.      “Football made me poorer. I spent most of my salary running the club. Maybe God wanted me to do this. Football is my calling and that is why I still find myself in it till this day”, he told Ohene-Bampoe Brenya in an interview on Happy 98.9FM.      He also disclosed that Abedi Pele has been of help to his team in difficult times.      Isaac Osei popularly known as “Asaase Jay” also disclosed that he decided to quit colts football because the venture wasn’t profitable as players were not grateful and appreciative of the sacrifice and care given them.

Heavy rains pummeled the eastern Caribbean on Wednesday due to a weather system headed to Puerto Rico and other islands that was expected to develop into a tropical storm and unleash flooding and landslides. The US National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was expected to move over or near Puerto Rico on Wednesday night, then brush the northern shores of Hispaniola the following day while on a path that could take it to the US mainland by the weekend.

Two and a half years ago I wrote a column chronicling my joy of becoming a grandmother for the first time. In it, I opened the story sharing the fact that I was mopping the floor as I looked on at the new little family enjoying bonding time together. I also stated that during my cleaning I was the happiest that I have ever been. My mother had helped me and now I was able to help my family, giving me a joy I could have never expected.


  Trust me, being happy doing house chores has never been something I thought I would ever feel. That was over two years ago and today nothing has changed because today, I am not only cleaning the house, but I am also helping to watch my vivacious red-headed grandson, Boston, as we await the arrival of his baby sister.


  That is correct. My husband John and I are grandparents again, this time to a sweet little baby girl.


  As I write this, the baby has been born and I am happy to report that Mom and baby Finley are doing fine as they are being cared for by the nurses at the hospital and our son, Tony. Due to COVID-19, the only person allowed to be at the hospital is the daddy.


  While I am extremely grateful that they are able to share this time together, there is a small part of me that wishes the family could have been there to see our new bundle of joy as soon as she was born.


  Truth be told, Finley’s parents might be relieved that they are the only ones able to be at the hospital. When Boston arrived so did the full force of the Marine Corps, as all of my son’s brothers-in-arms showed up to congratulate them. Boston was born on the Marine Corps birthday, after all.


  Then, to add to the excitement, throw in our loud Italian family and Jess’s family and extended family and you have a big, loving circus. A little peace and quiet might just be the best thing as the parents bond with their new daughter.


  Meanwhile, back at their house, there is total unbridled chaos as Boston runs all over the house playing with their three dogs and dragging out every toy he owns. Shew, this grandma has almost forgotten how much energy a toddler has! It looks like Toys “R” Us has exploded. Mopping before my son and daughter-in- law get home is the least of the cleaning that will need to be done.


  As I look at the picture they sent from the hospital of baby Finley, I marvel at the fact that babies are the biggest mystery of them all. What a colossal miracle they are. No one can tell me that they are not God’s divine plan. Ten tiny toes, two cute little ears and don’t even get me started on how precious a newborn smells. Estée Lauder could not make a smell that beautiful.


  Which leaves me thinking, as I watch Boston peacefully sleep right before I get up to finish cleaning the house he helped gleefully destroy, how two years ago, when I was mopping as I looked on at the new family, I thought I was the happiest I ever could be. I was certainly the happiest I ever was while doing housework.


  But now, today, I know I was wrong. Picking up toys your grandchild left lying around while you wait for your new grandbaby to come home from the hospital is the happiest I have been.


  Only until the baby gets here and spits up on my shirt — I cannot imagine how happy that is going to make me. Life is messy and Mysterious.

Perseverance will have many new capabilities that will transform how we explore Mars. The rover carries Ingenuity, a small helicopter that will be the first aircraft to fly on another planet. Because Mars' atmosphere today is so thin - only 1% of the Earth's - Ingenuity has to be extremely lightweight (4 lbs) with very large blades (4 feet tip-to-tip) to get off the ground. Ingenuity will take images of the distant landscape and help us scout the rover's traverse; future Mars missions could adopt this model of rovers and aircraft working in tandem.

Greeneville City Schools students will not return to classrooms when the system begins its academic year Aug. 5, Director of Schools Steve Starnes announced Tuesday at the Greeneville City Board of Education meeting.


  Because Greene County is currently in the red zone in the district’s plan for returning to school, indicating substantial community spread of COVID-19, the school system will be fully online when classes start.


  Substantial spread is defined in the district’s Framework for Safe Reopening of Schools as an average rate per 100,000 of 11 or more new COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days for a period of 3 consecutive days.


  Starnes said data will be reevaluated for a possible switch to allow students in school buildings on Aug. 24. Starnes said a decision will be announced the week of Aug. 17 to allow parents time to plan and make childcare arrangements if necessary.


  Starnes shared in his director’s report that while all students will begin the school year online according to the framework document, 612 students have registered for the fully online mode of learning. Of that number 280 are in kindergarten through fifth grade, 158 are middle school students and 174 are in high school.


  Due to a copyright issue Starnes said the district’s online learning academy will not be called the Greeneville Online Academy of Learning (GOAL) as previously discussed. Instead it will be called Excellence Driven by Greeneville City Schools (EDGE).


  Starnes said most of the instruction through EDGE, aside from some high school elective courses, will be delivered by Greeneville City Schools educators, who will be “compensated for going above and beyond.”


  The board granted Starnes authority to make changes to the Framework for Safe Reopening of Schools document as necessary in response to new information as it is released. This measure eliminates the need for a called board meeting in the event that new information affects the framework document.


  “It’s best to make changes quickly. It could be hard to get everyone together for a meeting every time information changes,” Board Member Josh Quillen said.


  Board Chair Cindy Luttrell also noted that action could be delayed if a called board meeting was required to make changes to the document.


  Starnes will notify the board of any changes as they are made.


  Shortly before the meeting, Gov. Bill Lee issued new recommendations for Tennessee schools to reopen safely, and Starnes discussed recent guidance from the Tennessee Department of Health, updated July 23, and from the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association Starnes which said said will be factored into the framework document.


  Changes include the recommendation that all staff wear cloth face coverings at all times while on campus unless medically prevented from doing so. Masks will also be recommended for elementary school students while in school buildings, and it is recommended students are allowed time outside where social distancing is possible and masks can be removed for some time during the school day.


  The board also voted to officially suspend several policies for the 2020-21 school year. The policies, including some related to attendance, field trips and public access to school facilities, were in conflict or could present conflict with the district’s framework document or executive orders from the governor’s office.


  A dress code policy was also updated to reflect the recommendation for the use of face masks in school.


  A purchase of Zoom videoconferencing software for the upcoming school year was also approved by the board at a cost of $15,000 to be covered through CARES Act funds.


  The district began using Zoom to continue education after schools closed in March. At that time it was provided for free through the Education Networks of America.


  I.T. Operations Administrator Chuck Broyles said that other videoconferencing software was considered, but Zoom was chosen as it is was determined to be more user friendly for young students than the other options.


  Assistant Director for Instruction Suzanne Bryant said classes taught through Zoom will be recorded and uploaded to Canvas, the learning management system in use by the district, for students to access later if they cannot attend the class at the time it is being broadcast. Bryant said another benefit of Zoom for online learning is that teachers can see all of their students in the call and interact with them.


  The cost was factored into the district’s CARES Act funding application. Broyles said the license purchase will give the district videoconferencing ability for the next year and will allow all teachers to use the software with no limit on the number of students who can join a call.


  The board also approved the purchase of 12 new cafeteria tables for Tusculum View Elementary School and lockers for students in first and second grades at the school.


  The cafeteria tables will cost $17,565, with $14,637.50 to be covered by the Tusculum View Elementary School Greeneville Schools In Action (GSIA) organization. The district will cover the remaining cost of $2,927.50.


  The lockers, which Tusculum View Principal Dr. Lana Luttrell said will help reduce the spread of germs by giving first and second grade students a closed compartment for their belongings so they do not touch other students’ things, will cost $11,760 and will be paid for by the school. Luttrell said much of the funding came from Box Tops fundraising.


  At the start of the meeting Starnes and the board recognized a donation of $10,000 to the Family Resource Center from retired Greeneville City Schools educator and principal Ken Fay.


  Fay said the funding came from his late mother’s estate, 10% of which she wanted to go to charity. Fay said his mother would be happy with the work being done at the center.


  “We appreciate your generosity and that of your mother,” Starnes said to Fay.


  The next regularly scheduled meeting for the Greeneville City School Board is Aug. 25 at 6 p.m.

Mr Hargreaves says the ensuing months were 'tough' and although the government has now given him the green light to reopen, there are still challenges to overcome.
 He explained: "We are now at a point where we are allowed to reopen but the demand is not there so we have got to try and reinvent things.
 "The world is not the same so business can't be either.
 "My goal is to make customers have a great time, to provide a safe environment and make sure the council and the town have absolutely no problem with using that space in the future.
 "If we use it responsibly and there is public demand, I hope it is a model that can happen year after year."

Calculations show that, maintaining the actual rate of population growth and resource consumption, in particular forest consumption, we have a few decades left before an irreversible collapse of our civilization.”

Though the three-term governor presides over a state with more confirmed cases of COVID than all but four _countries_ outside the US, Cuomo is for some reason being indulged with a "victory tour" for his wafer-thing claim to successful leadership in a crisis.


  This isn't to say Cuomo hasn't done anything right in his own coronavirus response, quite the contrary.


  New York was one of the first states hit hard by the virus at a time when governors had far less equipment, knowledge, and time to prepare than they have had in recent months. Under his governance, New York has successfully flattened the curve. And Cuomo pulled this off with virtually no help from the federal government.


  But even now, Cuomo is making inexplicable decisions that fly in the face of his own guidance.

Oliver Stone is een gigantische provocateur. Hij rammelt aan de kooien, doorprikt de bubbels van de watjes en wakkert de controverse aan. Hij is larger than life.' Met die bombast prijst acteerreus Anthony Hopkins Chasing the Light aan, de kraakverse biografie van Oliver Stone. De 75-jarige Vietnamveteraan hielp als scenarist Al Pacino aan de vele memorabele dialogen ( 'Say hello to my li'l friend') in Scarface, won drie Oscars en regisseerde in de jaren tachtig en negentig provocerende, donkere filmspektakels over Amerika's waanzin en etterende wonden zoals Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers, JFK en Nixon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ...

By comparison, hand sanitizer and household cleaners shot up, with GlobalData’s Covid-19 week 3 recovery survey reporting that a third of global consumers said they are stockpiling, buying significantly or slightly more household cleaning products. While demand for foodservice and on-the-go products was swallowed by the lockdown, consumers began to cook more from scratch, at home, buying up essentials like stock cubes.

Even though it couldn't take place in-person, Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board's online summer school programs still gave students a chance to get ahead.


  With some COVID-19 restrictions still in place, the Catholic board continued running a number of summer school programs through remote learning from July 6 to 24.


  Dan Finn, the ALCDSB summer school principal, said the programming was expanded this year to include more students, particularly in the primary grades.


  "In the last number of years, programs were delivered on-site and typically focused on primary grades for students in Grades 1 to 3, but this year, with additional ministry funding, it has allowed us to see students in Grades 1 through 8 to take part," he said. "We had about 300 families register, but as restrictions were lifted we did have some parents who wanted to move their children into day camp programs. We're still at about 270 students actively engaged, which is up about 75 kids from other years."


  The classes offered this summer to elementary students focused primarily on literacy and mathematics skills.


  "Each student connects with a teacher in their grade and they have two hours of synchronous (live) learning every day," Finn said. "We have a built-in 'body break' in the mornings to keep our students motivated, we have quite a large number of staff and this year we were able to hire two special education resource teachers who are really able to support students with special needs.


  "Every morning we typically have a large group for one hour where all the students are online with the assistants and online teacher, focusing primarily on literacy or mathematics."


  For Dustin Garrett, a Grade 6 teacher who's participated in the summer programs before, the biggest difference was just seeing how everyone was adapting.


  "I think it's just learning how (the students) are adapting to the times," Garrett said. "It's important to have that communication with the students and the families to find out what's working for them, what's not working and how you can make it better. The online piece has been an adjustment and we're making sure that we're available and providing feedback."


  Summer school gave Grade 6 student Medha Charan the opportunity to improve her mathematics skills ahead of starting Grade 7.


  "It (was) really fun and you won't be bored at summer school," Charan said. "I was surprised at how they teach you almost as if you are in school, but at home."


  The secondary school students, 345 of whom enrolled in credit courses at the secondary level, could choose to improve their mathematics, senior English, and careers/civics credit courses, and, as of this year, the KGL -- Personal Life Skills programs.


  Casey Wells, the vice-principal for the summer school, said ministry funding allowed for the addition of personal life skills program, which is designed to provide students in Life Skills Developmental Centres across the board an opportunity to meet each other, develop social skills in a digital format, learn and practice personal skills, and engage in group and individual synchronous learning each day.


  "It might be the first one of this nature to run in the summer," Wells said. "We have 11 students enrolled and this is the first time we've been able to offer it and it is really gaining traction."


  According to Finn, the summer program employed 22 teachers along with 33 virtual learning assistants, which include support staff, EAs, ECEs and university students. Again this year, the program was tied to the Queen's Connection, an engineering program.


  Material was delivered primarily through the Microsoft Teams platform and Finn said that, although no one knows for sure what the return to school will look like in September, utilizing the various platforms during the summer programming allowed teachers and students alike to be better prepared.


  Finn said participating in the summer school was beneficial for students who may have fallen behind after classrooms across Ontario closed in March.


  "I think that's why the ministry is continuing to fund these summer learning programs -- because there may be a lag or a decrease after being away from school and they really want to minimize that learning gap," Finn said. "I think this year it's more important than any year given the fact we've just come out of three and a half months of remote learning."

Moose brags to Gia Miller about his impressive "title defense" against Fallah Bahh. Moose says that he's going to put out another invitation for a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match but it will not be against EC3 who attacked him last week. Heath interrupts and says he's allowed to be here because even though he's not signed to IMPACT Wrestling, he is signed to TNA. Heath cons Moose into admitting that despite him being the self-proclaimed TNA World Heavyweight Champion, there is no TNA, rendering the belt meaningless. Moose realizes what he has done and gives Heath the invitation for a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match next week. Scott D'amore tells Heath that if he can beat Moose, he will earn a spot on the IMPACT roster.

BOONEVILLE, Northeast Mississippi Community College officials have issued the college’s Guide to a Safe Return to Campus.


  Northeast’s “Guide” includes information on Health & Safety, Academic Life, Campus Life, Finance and Business Operations, Human Resources, and a section on Athletics Return to Play. Officials also address safety measures for campus operations and events in the multi-page document.


  Northeast president Dr. Ricky G. Ford said the purpose for the “Guide” is simply to have all the information regarding the college’s plans for any COVID-19 related issues available to students, their families, faculty and staff in one document.


  “My cabinet and I have been meeting weekly since the beginning of the pandemic to make certain the college is as prepared as it can be for any scenario that may become reality due to the virus,” Ford said.


  “We wanted the entire college community to be on the same page as we moved forward toward having students and visitors back on campus this fall.”


  Under Health and Safety, Northeast employees, students and community members visiting campus are encouraged to practice safe social distancing protocols and hand sanitizing stations are located throughout. Northeast employees will also go through health and safety training and COVID-19 protocols will be distributed to all students via email and social media.


  Face coverings are to be worn by all employees, students and visitors while on any Northeast campus. Face coverings must be worn in all classrooms, labs, and shared office spaces regardless of physical distancing and must be worn when in an enclosed office where two or more people are present. Face coverings are not required in individual residence hall rooms, public outdoor settings, enclosed office spaces with a single person present, or in dining facilities while eating.


  Academically, Northeast will offer students a variety of choices when attending classes at one of the nation’s top community colleges.


  Northeast offers traditional face-to-face classes starting on August 3 and ending before the Thanksgiving holidays, hybrid classes with a mix of face-to- face and online learning and fully online education choices. Online classes begin August 24.


  During face-to-face classes, classrooms have been set up to adhere to social distancing requirements and masks are to always be worn.


  For those living in the college’s residence halls, one main entrance will be used for each residence hall while the lounge areas and kitchens are closed during the pandemic. Visitation is discouraged and each residence hall will have its own curfew to monitor in-and-out traffic.


  For those taking part in the college’s dining services, one main entrance will be used to access the college’s cafeteria and the eating space will be set up to adhere to all social distancing requirements. Grab-and-go selections will be made available and buffet lines are closed. For those accessing the Tiger Grill, a mask will be required for all services.


  Any student events scheduled throughout the 2020 fall semester will be subject to masks and social distancing requirements. However, the college will offer a wide variety of virtual programming on NEMCCTV.com and will stream large events on NEMCCTV.com as well to help mitigate the crowd size and supply options for those who choose not to attend. Programming will also be offered in multiple locations to minimize the crowd size.


  As the college returns to athletics, student athletes will be screened each day and will undergo temperature checks daily before taking part in team activities.


  Coaches are to send team activity schedules to the athletic training staff by noon the day before so that screenings can take place an hour before any team activity. Athletes must undergo checks for each different team activity.
