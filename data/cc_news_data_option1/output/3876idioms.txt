STOCKHOLM (AP) — Sweden, Finland and Estonia will jointly assess what they called “new significant information” in connection the sinking of a ferry in the Baltic Sea in 1994 with the loss of 852 lives. A television documentary about the disaster on the M/S Estonia includes new underwater video images from the wreck site showing a large hole in the hull. However, the countries said they will rely on a 1997 report that said the ferry sank after the bow door locks failed in a storm, and rejected the theory of a hole, which has long been the focus of speculation about a possible explosion on board.

FALL RIVER -- With the eye on the ball to redevelop the city's waterfront, the Fall River Redevelopment Authority has entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Liberty Utilities to purchase two acres of property at 45 Anawan St.
 "One of the functions of the RDA is the urban renewal plan and the waterfront renewal plan and this property falls within the scope of the waterfront plan. And when this opportunity came up it was a natural and that's what we are supposed to be looking for," said RDA Chairman Joseph Marshall.
 The proximity of the land was also attractive being across from the State Pier and next door to the Gates of the City.
 With a sale price of $698,500, the RDA has 60 days to do appropriate testing for land that is likely contaminated.
 "We're not sure of the direction we are going but we are going to be doing a lot of testing to see just what we can put on it," said Marshall. "It could end up being a parking lot because the city needs parking there. If it turns out its contaminated and all we can do is put a cap on it, then that's what we'll do."
 The parcel is identified in the RDA's Waterfront Renewal Plan and is currently used by Liberty Utilities.
 In May, the utility company purchased the former Homeland Builders property on Sykes Road in the Industrial Park for $5.8 million with a plan to make the 72,280-square-foot facility as its home base.
 Mayor Paul Coogan has said publicly that he supports the purchase of the land for future public use.
 Future development of the Anawan Street property would be an addition to the RDA's waterfront redevelopment initiative with an ongoing project to restore the four-acre City Pier into a public way.
 Last month the Seaport Economic Council awarded a $1 million grant to help redevelop the City Pier to add to RDA's pledge to invest another $1.6 million.
 Marshall said work will likely begin in the spring to cap the pier and add walkways, fencing and lighting at the site.

Spartacus the pet cat had a visit from a relative Thursday, but didn't seem to notice the big bobcat sitting by the rock in his yard.
 Spartacus's owner, Maria Croft, was working at her desk when she looked out the window and saw the wild animal in her Apponaug backyard.
 "I was stunned," she said. "At first I was thinking, 'What's that?' It was absolutely beautiful. It just sat there peacefully. It didn't look out of sorts or out of place. It looked right at home."
 She called her husband, Steph, and it took them both a few seconds to realize they were looking at a bobcat. Then she remembered that Spartacus was sharing space with the bigger cat.
 She sent Steph out to retrieve the pet, which was only 20 to 30 feet away from the wild cat. The bobcat seemed to take notice, but remained stoic as Steph was bringing the pet inside, according to Croft.
 "It just turned and walked away," she says.
 Before the bobcat left, Croft snapped some photographs and posted them to Facebook. She estimates the bobcat spent five to 10 minutes in her yard.
 Like Croft, many of her neighbors were in "awe" when they saw the photos, although some expressed trepidation. Croft has seen wild animals like deer and coyotes in the neighborhood, but never a bobcat. "It's still pretty suburban," she says.
 The bobcat population in Rhode Island seems to be increasing, according to Amy Mayer, a research associate for the University of Rhode Island's Wildlife Genetics and Ecology Lab.
 The URI lab and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management are wrapping up a five-year study of bobcats, which included trapping and tagging the animals to monitor their movements and also observing them on trail cameras.
 It's difficult to estimate how many bobcats live in Rhode Island, according to Mayer, but she notes there have been confirmed sightings in most Rhode Island cities and towns, except for Block Island, Aquidneck Island, Providence and North Providence. Westerly and the South Kingstown village of Matunuck seem especially popular for sightings.
 Still, it's remarkable to spot one sitting in the backyard of your Warwick home in the middle of the afternoon.
 "Sightings are pretty few and far between because they are cryptic and don't really like to be around people," Mayer says.
 They're also more active at night, hunting their favorite food sources such as rabbits, squirrels, mice, and sometimes birds. ("Boy, do we have squirrels!" Croft says. "This place would be a buffet for the bobcat!")
 What about pet cats? Mayer says bobcats wouldn't typically hunt pet cats, but "with any wild animal, I always tell people to keep an eye on your pets."
 Large house cats are sometimes mistaken for their wild relatives. Mayer has been shown plenty of photos of house cats from people who were convinced they'd spotted a bobcat. One sure way to tell them apart is the bobbed tail of the bobcat, according to Mayer. Bobcats are tall and leggy and weigh a maximum of 30 pounds, she says.
 "People are often surprised how big they appear, even though they are not that heavy," Mayer says.
 Croft describes her visitor as being "taller than a beagle but smaller than a lab."
 Might the bobcat return to visit the Crofts and Spartacus?
 "They move a ton," Mayer says. "Their range spans the entire width of the state."
 But who really knows?
 "They're cats," Mayer says. "They do what they want to do."

Due to the enforced due to Covid-19, the club used this time wisely to complete renovations. The club managed to fix the roof, paint the railings, render outside, a new uPVC door was donated and fitted by Coastal Windows, and laid new gravel to the front outside area. All this was done in preparation for the return of the boxers in July. So many of the boxers were desperate to return to some type of normality, as they hadn't been to school or the gym, and had no contact with their school friends or club mates, which left many of them feeling very isolated. It was so nice when they returned to see them smiling again, as we are all one big family at Torbay ABC. England Boxing has laid down very strict guidelines that the club has to follow concerning training sessions, which is very difficult to implement at times but at least the boxers are back in the gym and doing what they all love... boxing. Trainers and coaches have regular messages from parents expressing how much happier their sons and daughters are feeling. At present, due to some parent carers losing their jobs due to Covid-19, this has led to some financial difficulties. The club is not charging any subscriptions and is allowing the boxers to train for free, which is resulting in the club running at a loss but for everyone at the club it is all about working with the community and helping where they can. Hopefully, this terrible virus will soon be gone, so people can get their lives back. It is very heartening to see when things are bad, just how many good people are out there willing to help, and there are certainly plenty of them at Torbay ABC. The club is at present in the process of trying to arrange an awards night for all boxers, and this is proving very difficult with social distancing guidelines. The boxers were having an outstanding season before Covid-10, and it is only fair they are all recognised for the hard work they had put in. Coaching staff are sure they will be able to arrange something in the near future. With the boxers now back training again and having something to focus on and work to, trainers are hopeful that the boxing shows will resume in the near future. Meanwhile, it's great to be back!

Okinawa was the only high speed e-scooter maker in India to cross the 10,000 unit mark in FY2019-20 The electric scooter segment continues to grow exponentially in India as conservation of energy and preservation of the environment takes on a new meaning. New entrants are entering the fray and it may be seen from the attached table that there is a definite surge in demand for e-scooters among buyers in India. New EV incentive schemes introduced by the Government of India are going to bring about better sales even as there is a spate of new entrants into this segment. However, though there is a notable improvement in charging infrastructure, the higher prices of these electric scooters as against their petrol powered counterparts, coupled with lower range could take its toll on sales of electric two wheelers. In the electric two wheeler segment, 97 percent of sales comprised of electric scooters while the remaining 3 percent included electric motorcycles and cycles. We assess the leading OEMs in terms of sales between April 2019 and March 2020 but take only the high speed electric scooter sales into account and not those offering lower speed of 25 km\/h. OEM wise e-scooter sales April 2019-March 2020 Indian electric two wheeler maker, Okinawa was the only EV maker to cross the 10,000 unit mark in the past financial year. The e-scooter maker, the first company to receive FAME II approval for the electric two wheeler segment, currently has 7 models in its portfolio with the popular ones being the Okinawa Praise (Rs. 69,790), PraisePro (Rs. 79,990) and i Praise (Rs. 1.08 Lakhs). Total sales in FY2020 stood at 10,133 units while market share was at 42.22%. The best month of sales was in November 2019 when 1,394 units were sold. The company had also shown off the new Okinawa Cruiser at the 2020 Auto Expo and will retail at around Rs.1.2 lakhs making it the company\u2019s most premium model. Following Okinawa in the high speed electric scooter segment was Hero Electric. This e-scooter maker recorded sales of 7,399 units in FY2020 with 30.83% market share. Hero has 8 models in its lineup with prices starting at Rs.39,900 going up to Rs.79,990. The most popular models are the Optima LA (Rs. 44,990), Flash (Rs. 39,990) and Dash (Rs. 50,000).

"It is apparent that from the fact of this case, the role of two of its (CBI's) ex-directors is under scanner i.e AP Singh and Ranjit Sinha along with alleged middleman Moin Qureshi which needs frank and honest investigations. Image of the CBI as a premier investigating agency of the country is redoubtable. However at the same time, it has to rise to the occasion to investigate the allegations against its two top honchos to further enhance its eminence as there comes a time in the lifetime of any institution or organization where it finds itself at crossroads, then it has to take a path which is the right path which leads to sunshine and glory," said the court.

_Torbay Amateur Boxing Club is back training_
 Due to the enforced due to Covid-19, the club used this time wisely to complete renovations.
 The club managed to fix the roof, paint the railings, render outside, a new uPVC door was donated and fitted by Coastal Windows, and laid new gravel to the front outside area.
 All this was done in preparation for the return of the boxers in July.
 So many of the boxers were desperate to return to some type of normality, as they hadn’t been to school or the gym, and had no contact with their school friends or club mates, which left many of them feeling very isolated.
  _The boxers return to training_
 It was so nice when they returned to see them smiling again, as we are all one big family at Torbay ABC.
 England Boxing has laid down very strict guidelines that the club has to follow concerning training sessions, which is very difficult to implement at times but at least the boxers are back in the gym and doing what they all love... boxing.
 Trainers and coaches have regular messages from parents expressing how much happier their sons and daughters are feeling.
 At present, due to some parent carers losing their jobs due to Covid-19, this has led to some financial difficulties.
 The club is not charging any subscriptions and is allowing the boxers to train for free, which is resulting in the club running at a loss but for everyone at the club it is all about working with the community and helping where they can.
 Hopefully, this terrible virus will soon be gone, so people can get their lives back.
 It is very heartening to see when things are bad, just how many good people are out there willing to help, and there are certainly plenty of them at Torbay ABC.
 The club is at present in the process of trying to arrange an awards night for all boxers, and this is proving very difficult with social distancing guidelines.
 The boxers were having an outstanding season before Covid-10, and it is only fair they are all recognised for the hard work they had put in. Coaching staff are sure they will be able to arrange something in the near future.
 With the boxers now back training again and having something to focus on and work to, trainers are hopeful that the boxing shows will resume in the near future.
 Meanwhile, it’s great to be back!
