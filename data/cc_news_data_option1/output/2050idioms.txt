Underneath the hood of the Motorola Edge lies a battery with 4,500 mAh capacity. However, as we have already often pointed out, the battery's capacity on paper isn't a totally decisive factor when it comes to the smartphone's overall runtime. There are other factors that one ought to consider, including the types of components used, software optimization, and user behavior, all play important roles in the overall battery life.

 If the battery has run completely empty, you ought to display some patience, because the 18W TurboCharger requires 2 hours and 33 minutes to recharge the 4,500 mAh until it is full. It is this aspect where Motorola falls behind its competition and there is still plenty of work that can be done.

The Polish section of Yamal-Europe is not fully loaded and therefore does not work around the clock, Gaz-System, the gas pipeline operator in Poland, explained earlier in the day.
 The contract for the transit of Russian gas via Poland expired on May 16, and from May 17, pumping along the Polish section of Yamal-Europe has been carried out only by auction results. So, according to the results of auction for June about 94 percent of the gas pipeline's capacities were reserved.
 Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov said that despite the expiration of the current transit contract with Poland, gas supplies through the country will continue one way or another. In turn, the Polish government's commissioner for strategic energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said that the country expected to continue transit of Russian gas via its territory.

Preventing church does not prevent worship
   
 A May 20 letter, "Governors depriving citizens of rights," claims that government policies scientifically formulated to minimize spread of the coronavirus "prevent worship."
   
 Why can't people worship wherever they are, including at home? Do you have to have a special place to be religious in? I can see if you miss your church friends, but that is a far different matter from your act of worshiping being prevented.
   
 There are now multiple cases nationwide of pastors flaunting the social distancing rules, resulting in infections and deaths. I guess their God didn't see fit to protect them.

 Young conservationist wants to save ranch
   
 My name is Brice. I'm 12. I want to be a conservationist. My mom recently showed me an article about Orange Hammock Ranch, a 5,777-acre wild property near North Port.
   
 The state will pay $19.5 million through the Florida Forever Fund to preserve it if the Conservation Foundation raises the last $300,000 in donations before June 1. What a rare conservation opportunity!
   
 Besides habitat, the property also provides clean drinking water for the area. Being so into conservation, I wanted to help, but being a kid I don't have much money. So, I decided the best way to help was to spread the word.
   
 Can you imagine the sun setting over live oak hammocks surrounded by seas of grass, herons walking gracefully along rivers, an eagle perched in a lone pine tree overlooking a field of wildflowers where butterflies are dancing among the coreopsis, gaillardia and verbena blooms?
   
 The thought of all of that destroyed, paved over with concrete, is heartbreaking. To help protect this beautiful scene, please go to conservationfoundation.org and donate.

 Time for our libraries to safely reopen
   
 Sarasota County beaches and parks are open. Stores and restaurants may reopen at 50% capacity. Strict safety precautions have allowed hair salons, gyms and even casinos to open.
   
 So when are our excellent county libraries going to reopen?
   
 Gov. Ron DeSantis announced May 15 that libraries could open at 50% capacity. Since May 4, our county libraries have offered curbside pickup, but there is still no date for reopening.
   
 Along with limiting visitors to 50%, it would seem fairly easy to provide other safety precautions: Bookshelf lanes can be made one way. Checkouts are already touchless by scanning one's library card. Returned books can be sanitized and stored for a couple days before going back on shelves.
   
 On a recent visit to a county elementary school front office, throwaway masks were being given out, along with hand sanitizing lotion.
   
 I miss my library, much more than gyms, restaurant dining and casinos.

 'Wartime president' fighting wrong war
   
 President Donald Trump says he is a "wartime president" and likes to be known as such. But the problem is, he's fighting the wrong war. He should be in a war with the coronavirus. As commander in chief, he should have provided presidential leadership, and rallied to the cause.
   
 But he didn't. Instead, he went to campaign rallies, golf outings and parties at Mar-a-Lago while downplaying the virus. President Barack Obama left him a complete pandemic playbook, but he chose not to use it.
   
 Trump's war is with Obama, the Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the press, reporters that ask him questions he doesn't like or can't answer, and anybody in government who doesn't toe the line or praise him.
   
 Now he's opened up another front on governors who refuse to open up their states and the Centers for Disease Control, and sidelined Dr. Anthony Fauci, our country's leading expert on virology.
   
 Trump's war is self-created because he has to have enemies in order to get up in the morning. Fighting the virus is already old news to him as he moves on, trying to force the economy back while people are dying.

 All are called to give according to our means
   
 In addition to her other astonishing charitable donations, Oprah Winfrey is donating $10 million to help victims of the pandemic. We can easily dismiss Winfrey's generosity by saying, "Well, she can afford it."
   
 A more nuanced understanding of philanthropic outreach should include all of us. We are all called to compassion in accordance with what we can afford to give. No matter what our economic standing might be, we all can afford something.
   
 Even the homeless man can afford to lend a helping hand to someone in need -- half of his sandwich, or a corner of his blanket to shelter a friend from the cold?
   
 None of us can rightfully excuse ourselves from our own responsibility by simply saying, "Well, the rich can afford it."

CBD is perfect for regulating this negative reaction and reducing inflammation in the body.
