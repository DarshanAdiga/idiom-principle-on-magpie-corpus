Our nation is no stranger to catastrophe, maybe not on the level we’re experiencing now, but I'm thinking of a time not so long ago when a catastrophe disrupted schools in the South. It was called Hurricane Katrina, and it hit New Orleans on Aug. 23, 2005. Although President George W. Bush was roundly criticized for his federal response to the disaster, he and Education Secretary Dr. Rod Paige responded to Katrina's impact with $1.9 billion to help schools that were forced to take in thousands of displaced students.

It's therefore understandable why the US is so enraged since it had hitherto taken its financial influence over the organization for granted and accordingly always presumed that it could politicize the group for its own strategic ends, which in this case appear to be the desire to generate international pressure on China over its initial response to the COVID-19 outbreak late last year. The very fact that Washington has been so unsuccessful in this respect when it comes to the WHO despite spending almost ten times as much as Beijing does strongly suggests that there's a lot more going on behind the scenes than it initially seems. What's actually happened (however loath the US is to publicly admit it) is that China gradually broke America's previous soft power monopoly over this globalist body and other related institutions through its skillful employment of "economic diplomacy".

Much of the Jewish self-congratulation takes place behind the scenes, at events that are for Jews only or in discussions inside the Jewish media, but of late the empowering of Zionist and Jewish interests by President Donald Trump and the success in shutting down criticism of Israel has served to embolden those who like to boast of the tribe’s accomplishments. The latest bit of bragging rights in respect to Jewish power in the U.S. belongs to a group called the Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI). The DMFI is a registered political action committee (PAC) that lobbies on behalf of the Jewish state. It was organized in 2019 by Democratic Party activists to counter what was perceived to be pro-Palestinian sentiment within the party’s progressive wing.

Ultimately, it’s long past time to stop pushing abortion and birth control, and encourage more family-friendly policies. For decades, our pro-abortion society has failed women, forcing them to choose between their children, and their education or their careers. Pro-life policies, like paid family leave, can further encourage couples to have children. Schools and workplaces that embrace students and employees with children can likewise make a big difference. But a pro-family culture is sorely needed, in the United States and around the world. Falling fertility rates are a major problem, and we can’t continue to look the other way.

 My father turned 103 last December in India. I had to cancel my annual visit to see him this month. India has completely shut down; no commercial flights are allowed and my father understands -- all too well.
 He was 2 when his father passed away in his village in Jammu from the Spanish flu, which went on to wipe out 6% of the Indian population (17 million-18 million people died). He does not remember details except that his grandfather became obsessed with preserving the life of a fatherless child and would stay with him like a shadow.
 India was under British colonial rule at the time, who oversaw feudal rulers known as Maharajas. There were no medical facilities in the rural countryside. Most people relied on homeopathic remedies and fate. There are conflicting views about how the flu reached India. It is generally believed that it was brought to India via a ship of returning World War I soldiers that docked in Bombay (now Mumbai) in June 1918.
 Father grew up in an era of no medications, immunizations, antibiotics and running water. Villagers would drink water from the local ponds. The Darwinian theory of the survival of the fittest is the only rational explanation of how people survived in India, or for that matter, much of the world.
 Father had no interest in education. Schools were sparse and he detested going to middle school, which was 12 miles away, necessitating him to stay in a boy's hostel for the week and walk back that distance over the weekend. He refused to go back after seventh grade, much to the dismay of his doting grandfather, who was the village priest.
 After a few years, his grandfather, sensing his own declining health, sent father to live with his uncle in Karachi (in present-day Pakistan), where he worked in a factory until another major cataclysmic event: the partition of India, which killed more than a million people.
 After the partition, father moved to north India and worked in that same factory, which had moved there from Karachi, until his retirement, whereupon he finally moved back after nearly 50 years to the same village and house that his grandfather lived in. Life had come full circle. He lived alone until 95 years of age, and now, with increasing frailty, resides with my brother in Jammu.
 Now, separated by a century, there is another pandemic sweeping through India and the world. India, with its billion-plus people, is at grave risk again with an insufficient health care system. This time, the virus is thought to have spread to India from Italian tourists.
 India is a few weeks behind the United States, and how an epicenter is formed remains a mystery. Father is hopeful and prays that his family and his country does not suffer the same fate.

 William Dale McKee, 84, of Wilmington, was resurrected to meet his Lord and Savior on Resurrection Sunday, April 12, 2020. Born in Clinton County on June 29, 1935, he was the son of the late William Robert and Thelma (Baber) McKee. William, widely known as Bill or Dale, was a unique soul whose heart only got bigger as he aged. William served in the U.S. Army and was a proud veteran. As a jack of all trades and a master of many things, some of his endeavors were as a farmer, printing press operator, mason, craftsman, builder, retailer and owner of McKee Construction Company and Blessed Manufacturing. He found tremendous joy in seeing his grandchildren and great- grandchildren. He always seemed ready to pull out money for each one. He was even affectionately known as Papal Money to a few. William found strength in his family and would often rise, even weakly from his bed just to give a proper hug. He enjoyed hunting and fishing as taught to him by his dad. Growing up on a farm, he found pleasure in the great outdoors. He often bragged about living off the fat of the land as he raised various animals and grew much of his own produce. William was an avid herbalist and could tell you what plant, herb or seed was good for what ails you. Often, he could walk out onto his farm and harvest your cure. He enjoyed recalling stories of being taught the task of forging for herbs with his mother. He loved to drive while listening to music and called it his therapy. In his final days, he would recall fond memories of various family, friends and loved ones and end the thought with how … the Good Lord blessed me. In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by two of his children, son Travis Burns McKee and daughter Cynthia An'ne (McKee) Glass. William has laid to rest his best friend and only brother, Robert McKee and his only beloved sister, Marilyn Clark, as well. He is survived by seven children, all from his union with wife (divorced), Blanca Mae (Burns) McKee. They are William Dale McKee, Jr., Jyles Arquette (Paige) McKee, Miles Blake (Beth) McKee, Crystal Hope Day, Gerald Pleasant McKee, Rosemary Stephanie (Brian) Braxton and Maude NaCole Cantrell; along with a host of grandchildren, great grandchildren, cousins, nieces, nephews, family and friends. A memorial service will take place at a later date, when social distancing restrictions have been lifted. Littleton Funeral Home has been entrusted with the arrangements. Please visit littletonfuneralhome.com to leave a condolence for the family.

In some states, such as my native Pennsylvania, partisanship in judicial races is out in the open. Candidates for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court are nominated in Democratic and Republican primaries, and in the general election their party affiliations appear on the ballot. But even in some states with nonpartisan elections, the parties are important offstage players.
 More than 20 states choose members of their states’ highest courts in elections; in the others, the governor or in some cases the legislature makes the choice, though the voters may have an opportunity to weigh in later. (In California, the governor nominates a candidate for the high court who must be approved by the Commission on Judicial Appointments and ultimately by the voters.) In states that do elect judges of the highest courts, special- interest groups are increasingly taking an interest and spending large amounts of money.
 To which some might object: Why shouldn’t judicial selection be an openly political process? Judges, and not just on the U.S. Supreme Court, make decisions that profoundly shape the lives of citizens — in some ways more than legislatures do. And if party labels serve as a reliable shorthand for a would-be legislator’s political philosophy, don’t they also correlate in many cases to judicial philosophy?
 At a time when newspapers routinely identify federal judges by which president nominated them and judicial confirmation votes in the U.S. Senate break down largely on party lines, it might seem naïve to insist that judges are — or at least ought to be — something other than politicians in black robes.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said Wednesday he would support the idea of holding the Travelers Championship golf tournament in June, even if that means fans might not be able to attend. The PGA Tour plans to release a tentative schedule Thursday. Golf Digest has reported the tour will try to resume June 11-14 at the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas, without fans. The Travelers would keep its spot on June 25-28, but Lamont acknowledged that the public may not be allowed to attend, calling that a “new normal” for this year. If the tour can stick to its modified schedule, it is expected to play without fans for a month. “I kind of like that report, if it turns out to be true, that we're going to have a chance at least on TV to enjoy a sport which showcases the best of Connecticut in a safe way,\" Lamont said. “So, I don't think that's too soon.” The tournament, which draws close to 300,000 fans to TPC River Highlands in Cromwell each year, raised more than $2.1 million for 150 local charities in 2019. Golf already has rescheduled three of the four majors, starting with the PGA Championship on Aug. 6-9 at Harding Park in San San Francisco. The U.S. Open — which typically precedes the Travelers Championship — would be Sept. 17-20 at Winged Foot, followed a week later by the Ryder Cup in Wisconsin and the Masters on Nov. 12-15. PGA of America CEO Seth Waugh said earlier this week that playing without fans at the PGA Championship was possible. “It will feel strange to play without fans,” Charles Howell III said Wednesday. “However, if that's one of the steps forward and it's agreed upon by the officials that I feel we need approval from, then that's how it has to be.” ____ AP Golf Writer Doug Ferguson contributed to this report

 Currently, local emergency management officials are assessing the damage caused by the storms in the impacted counties. Once those assessments are completed and relayed to the S.C. Emergency Management Division, the governor will request a federal disaster declaration.

Easter 2020 will be remembered for a very long time as the Sunday America had no Easter. Or, the Easter where churches did not gather in small and large buildings. This is disappointing to multitudes. It is the "one" Sunday that many Americans attend church. Globally, churches pull out all the stops for presenting their best music. Ministers have been working the last several weeks polishing up their sermons. But it's the same story, the old story that, once a year, people come to hear.
 Some people still buy new clothes for Easter. Americans are more casual than ever, but retailers still make out good for Easter, but not this year. Macy's and other retailers just furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers. For these retailers, Easter has been cancelled, and they are feeling it in their pocketbooks.
 The first Easter didn't have a date of April 12. We don't know the date. We do know that the followers of Jesus were terrified.

Upon being tapped, Yamahata allegedly slumped to the ground and was unable to move, paralyzed by some inscrutable force. This pushed Kawano into action, and he quickly scooped his friend up onto his shoulders and ran from the area as fast as his legs could carry him. When he got home, Yamahata came to, and they supposedly told their parents what had happened, who would grudgingly follow the boys out to the estate outside to see the strange orange light climbing up into the sky for themselves. The light would then emit a burst of blinding light and vanish. Later, school officials would descend upon the area in daylight to examine the site, and would allegedly find two sturdy concrete posts that had been pushed over by some powerful force, as well as a ring pattern etched into the ground nearby. Authorities of the Civil Aviation Bureau of Transportation Ministry would later get wind of the story and dismiss the lights as merely from normal aircraft in the area. No word on what they thought the fanged humanoid could have been, or if it had anything to do with what Shiota would witness a month later.

Burd said it was strange to want one of his best friends “to dig deep into that pain for the sake of the show.” He knew GaTa “wanted to go there, but I felt …,” he trailed off. “I’m trying to find the word for it.”
 “Guilty” was the word Schaffer offered sheepishly. Yet GaTa said he’s proud of his work in the scene, a feeling that only increased after the episode aired and folks began telling him how meaningful it had been to see an experience similar to theirs represented on TV — an experience, he added, not often discussed in the African American community.
 “I went to PetSmart the other day, this black lady came up to me and cried — like, ‘Yo, your story touched me. I was gonna commit suicide a year ago, but I wanna say thank you for sharing that. It really helped me through one of these hard times.’”
 Dr. Todd Boyd, who teaches about the intersection of race and popular culture at USC, linked GaTa’s portrayal to earlier pronouncements regarding mental health by Kanye West and the Lakers’ Metta World Peace. And he pointed to the dramatic precedent set by Tony Soprano, whose use of a therapist on “The Sopranos” — in a Mafia milieu no less masculine than the hip-hop scene — helped redefine how we think about the relatable TV character.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eleven vessels from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) came dangerously close to U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Gulf, the U.S. military said on Wednesday, calling the moves "dangerous and provocative."
 While such interactions had occurred occasionally a few years ago, they had largely stopped in recent months and years, and this incident comes at a time of increased tensions between the two countries.
 According to the statement, the Iranian ships approached six U.S. military ships while they were conducting integration operations with Army helicopters in international waters.
 At one point, the Iranian vessels came within 10 yards of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Maui.
 The U.S. ships issued several warnings through bridge-to-bridge radio, blasts from the ships' horns and long-range acoustic noise maker devices.
 The Iranian ships left after about an hour, the statement added.
 There was no mention of the incident in Iranian media.
 "The IRGCN's dangerous and provocative actions increased the risk of miscalculation and collision, (and) were not in accordance with the internationally recognized Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea," the U.S. military's statement said.
 The incident comes at a time of increased tensions between Iran and the United States. Earlier this year, the United States killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in a drone strike in Iraq.
 Iran retaliated on Jan. 8 with a rocket attack on Iraq’s Ain al-Asad base where U.S. forces were stationed. No U.S. troops were killed or faced immediate bodily injury, but more than 100 were later diagnosed with traumatic brain injury.

I picked up the phone off the holder, hoping for dial tone. Instead, I heard voices. I groaned inwardly and placed the phone back on the “hook.” Ten minutes to change clothes, grab a glass of milk, and a cookie and I strode back to the phone. The same voices droned on. I listened a bit longer this time. Knowing who is on the line makes all the difference. Great! This woman could go on forever. I sighed heavily into the mouthpiece and waited. Possibly knowing someone was listening in would shorten their conversation. No such luck!
 Five minutes later, I placed the phone back on its rest none too gently. A bit more time passed, and I picked up the receiver again. This time I became so engrossed in the conversation that I forgot about Nila until I heard someone open the front door. Mom! She did not approve of listening in, though I do remember an occasion or two when I walked in the room, and she gave me the “Quiet” signal and sheepishly set the phone back in its place.
 Then there were the times when I was engaged in a serious conversation with a friend and suddenly we heard the unmistakable click of someone else coming on the line. Discussing the critical issues of teenage life when you know someone is listening just does not happen. Long periods of silence ensued, that is, silence interspersed with three people breathing.
 At last, the intruder gave up so we could carry on. Not for long. This time the clicking turned to an annoying rattle. Obviously, the person was pushing the receiver button on and off. Then the dialing noise growled through the line. How could anyone be so rude? We responded with another bout of breathy silence. At last, an irate male voice invaded our silent communication, “Will you girls please hang up? I need to make a call and this is an emergency.”
 Reluctantly, we said resentful goodbyes and hung up.
 I waited about a minute and then oh-so-gently picked up the receiver. After all, if this was truly an emergency, I needed to know. Mom would want to know, too, in case she had to bake a cake for a funeral or something. The guy had some nerve! He called the Erwin elevator to order a load of pig feed! The idea that he interrupted our meaningful conversation and claimed there was an emergency was appalling. I took great pleasure in slamming the phone down on the cradle!
 Most Party Lines were phased out in the 1970s and replaced by private lines, marking the end of an entertaining era. Goodbye to the satisfaction of the dramatic slamming of the phone. Goodbye to the frustration of not being able to get on the line because someone was already on it.
 Chats and Tweets are fun, I am sure, and the whole world will still know your business in minutes, but can anything compare to the original social media? HellO-O! Why do you think it was called a Party Line?

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Two Alabama women have been accused of fatally shooting another woman, wounding a man and causing a subsequent car crash, authorities said. Charletta Nadine Anderson, 26, and Shaniqua Lawry, 29 were charged with attempted murder and murder in the death of 21-year-old Ja’Shundra White, news outlets reported. Montgomery police Capt. Regina Duckett said Anderson was arrested Tuesday evening and Lawry was arrested Wednesday morning. Police said officers responded to a two-car crash Friday evening where they found White and the unidentified man. Duckett said medical personnel determined both victims had been shot, which caused the car crash. White was later pronounced dead. Duckett said as of Monday, the man remained in a life-threatening condition. An investigation revealed Anderson, Lawry and the victims had an “ongoing dispute” which resulted in the shooting. Details surrounding the dispute weren't immediately released. It's unclear whether Anderson or Lawry have attorneys who could comment on their behalf.

Always wanted to learn how to make bechamel? Or understand the difference between champagne and cremant? Now you can.
   
 One bright side to socially distant home life is all the newfound time to cook. But if you don't know your paring knife from your ginsu, you can now attend your own cooking school at home.
   
 Many culinary masters and food-and-drink educators are posting their knowledge on the web -- some for free.
   
 The Italian chef Massimo Bottura, whose Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, scored three Michelin stars, is hosting daily live lessons on Instagram, which he's calling "Kitchen Quarantine."
   
 And he doesn't waste time getting to the most important instruction for any chef in the time of coronavirus -- or ever. "First of all," Bottura says, "wash your hands."
   
 So far, he's gone over curry, salad and even mac-and-cheese -- yes, kid food from one of the world's best chefs. You have to tune in live -- 3 p.m. Eastern -- for his hyper-enthusiastic lesson, but Bottura also posts a Q&A; afterward, dipping in and out of Italian and English. An extra tutorial en Italiano on that bechamel sounds as luxurious as the sauce.
   
 If you like watching people do what they do best, then go to the always-free Bon Appetit Video channel. The magazine's test kitchen chefs have become cult celebrities with their offbeat-yet-gripping shows. Chris Morocco tries to recreate a dish while blindfolded? Sure. Carla Lalli Music teaches a celebrity how to cook while standing back-to-back? OK.
   
 Best of all is "Gourmet Makes," pastry chef Claire Saffitz's trial-and-error epic, in which she attempts to recreate junk food. Almost always, she struggles until lightning strikes. It's 40 suspenseful minutes of comfort food on screen. (Bonus: Saffitz went to summer camp in Bemidji, she says in her Combos episode.) One could learn how to make Girl Scout Cookies from scratch, but the real lesson is that perseverance is an indispensable kitchen ingredient.
   
 More lessons can be learned from the queen of cooking shows, Julia Child. Through the end of the month, Amazon Prime members can stream her classic series "The French Chef" for free. (The rest of the time, the show is a paid add-on in Prime or through TPT Passport.) If you need to get over the ick- factor of handling raw chicken, Child won't hold your hand, but she will show you how it's done. "Here is our dear little friend, the chicken," she says in one episode in her jolly lilt, while knifing it to pieces.
   
 The New York Times cooking team has a YouTube channel where Melissa Clark, Alison Roman and guests like Jamie Oliver and "Queer Eye"'s Antoni Porowski do baked ziti, cookies and more.
   
 Christopher Kimball's Milk Street magazine, which normally charges for its online Cooking School, has taken down the paywall on more than a dozen classes. Each class page contains videos, recipes, step-by-step photo guides and scans of related articles from the magazine. You'll still need to register on the site, but there's no payment.
   
 America's Test Kitchen has also removed its paywall on its 50 "all-time favorite" recipes. The site also posts full episodes of its cooking show, and more than 50 of the most recent episodes are free to stream. Travel via your kitchen with recent offerings like "The Very Best Paris-Brest" and "A Trip to Rome."
   
 Food Network Kitchen, the TV channel's educational app with live classes, does charge by the month (or year). But you can get a free starter month when you sign up, though you'll have to enter credit card information.

 I have lived in this Des Moines neighborhood for more than a decade and walked this lap hundreds of times. But in recent weeks, as we have been staying close to home because of the COVID-19 outbreak, I have come to appreciate this little piece of the outdoors more than ever.

 With two young kids, the outdoors has also kept us sane and grounded. In addition to lots of time in the yard, we've been finding less populated nature areas nearby to get fresh air. We just have to have a pep talk about giving people appropriate space before we head out.

It doesn't have to be all doom and gloom, though, and nobody has a die as a result of the US withholding its funding from the WHO so long as the group internally reforms in order to adapt to that new reality. Considering that neither China, Russia, a combination of the two and/or they and their partners across the world are likely to replace the financial void left by the US, the WHO will have no choice but to more effectively use whatever money remains in order to ensure that its primary activities continue unimpeded. This means that the organization will have to stop spending twice as much on travel as it does on medical supplies, among other long-overdue reforms aimed at optimizing its operations in parallel with reducing the possibility of having unnecessary expenses exploited for corrupt purposes. Seen from this perspective, Trump's possible decision could actually be a blessing in disguise if it compels the WHO to focus more on its founding mission.

Hess and Ovintiv have also recently cut costs as they adjust to lower oil prices. Hess slashed its spending plan by 27%. Ovintiv, meanwhile, has cut spending twice to better align it with projected cash flows at lower oil prices. However, if oil keeps falling, both might need to make additional reductions to stay afloat.

 TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz failed to strike a unity government deal in last-ditch talks late on Wednesday.
 Even the medical and economic crises brought on by the coronavirus outbreak have so far failed to end an unprecedented political deadlock that has pushed Israel into three inconclusive elections in the last year, and perhaps now a fourth.
 Gantz and Netanyahu had been negotiating a power-sharing deal that would have kept the right-wing premier in office for another 18 months, Israeli media reported.
 Under the arrangement, centrist former general Gantz would have taken over after that.
 It was Gantz, a relative newcomer to politics, who was given the first chance to put together a government after the most recent election, in March.
 President Reuven Rivlin, who is overseeing the talks, said on Monday that progress justified his decision to grant Gantz a two-day extension to hash out a deal with Netanyahu.
 But Gantz's mandate expired at midnight on Wednesday after a last-minute attempt by the two leaders' envoys to clinch a deal. Failure complicates plans for economic recovery once the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control, and the country's stringent lockdown is eased.
 Without a deal, it will be up to parliament to pick a candidate who would then have 14 days to form a government. Failure to do so would automatically trigger a snap election.
 Gantz had previously said he would not serve in a government led by Netanyahu, who is facing indictment on corruption charges but denies any wrongdoing. The trial is due to begin next month.
 But the enormity of the coronavirus crisis prompted Gantz to break his campaign promise and to consider a deal, a move that angered many of his anti- Netanyahu supporters.
 The outcome appeared to weaken Gantz while strengthening Netanyahu, whose caretaker government is overseeing the country's response to the coronavirus crisis.
 A Monday poll from Israel's Channel 12 news said that if an election were held now, Netanyahu's Likud party would see a four-seat boost to 40 in the 120-member Knesset, while Gantz's weakened Blue and White party would win only 19.
 The poll also found that some 64% of citizens were satisfied with Netanyahu's handling of the pandemic.
 Israel has reported over 12,500 COVID-19 cases and at least 130 deaths. Restrictions have confined most Israelis to their homes, forcing businesses to close and sending unemployment to more than 25%.

Doug adds: "In 1977, however, John cooked up an idea for a novel, making him a spirit who was repeatedly killed, only to walk in to other host bodies. The premise allowed John to have some fun with a plot brimming with sex, violence, conspiracy, poltergeists, walk-ins, organized crime, mysterious cartels, the Elks, and the Kennedy assassination. And, for good measure, funny underwear. In later years, he often lamented that fictionalized forteana was more commercial than reportage; and that 'The X-Files' and 'Men In Black' were lifting plot points from his books. 'The Return of the Umbrella Man' was an attempt to create an entertainment using some of the same paranormal material."

The emerging Multipolar World Order is the Weltanschauung shaping the contours of World War C whereby the outcome of this global struggle looks likely to further reduce the US' unipolar control over the international system in more ways than one. In practical terms, this can most immediately be seen by the growing controversy over the World Health Organization (WHO) after Trump proclaimed late last week that his country was seriously considering cutting off funding to this globalist body due to what his administration alleges is it positive bias towards his Chinese rival. This accusation is surprising for many considering that the US currently funds the organization to the tune of over $400 million a year whereas China contributes comparatively less at approximately $44 million, which is a difference of nearly ten times that would thus imply that the People's Republic receives much more "bang for its buck" than America does by an almost unbelievably large margin.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A group of 11 Iranian naval vessels made “dangerous and harassing” maneuvers near U.S. ships in the North Arabian Sea on Wednesday, in one case passing within 10 yards of a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, U.S. officials said. In a written statement, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps vessels repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns of several American ships at close range and high speed. In the group of U.S. ships was the USS Paul Hamilton, a Navy destroyer, and the USS Lewis B. Puller, a ship that serves as an afloat landing base. The U.S. ships were operating with U.S. Army Apache attack helicopters in international waters, the statement said. The “dangerous and provocative actions increased the risk of miscalculation and collision, were not in accordance with the internationally recognized Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea ‘rules of the road’ or internationally recognized maritime customs, and were not in accordance with the obligation under international law to act with due regard for the safety of other vessels in the area,” the statement said. The Americans issued multiple warnings via bridge-to-bridge radio, five short blasts from the ships’ horns and long-range acoustic noise maker devices, but received no immediate response, the U.S. statement said. After about an hour, the Iranian vessels responded to the bridge-to-bridge radio queries, then maneuvered away.

 TAUNTON - The number of Taunton residents testing positive for COVID-19 has risen by four during the last 24 hours, according to the office of Mayor Shaunna O'Connell.
 A total of 218 people in the city, as compared to 214 on Monday, have contracted the deadly respiratory disease, which so far has claimed 957 lives across the state, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
 The mayor's office each day gets local COVID-19 statistics from the city's Board of Health, which gets its numbers from the state's Department of Public Health.
 All 218 in Taunton who have tested positive for the deadly pandemic are on the \"active\" list of people who have not yet recovered, according to Radka Barter, the mayor's deputy chief of staff.
 The DPH on Tuesday reported 113 new coronavirus-related deaths from the previous day bringing the number of deaths throughout the state up to 957.
 DPH also reported that seven Bristol County residents have died from March 31 to April 13.
 The number of people statewide testing positive for COVID-19 from Monday through Tuesday increased by 1,296 to a total of 28,163.
 Raynham reports two new cases of residents testing positive for the disease. The town says 84 residents have been infected as compared to 82 on Monday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Leading Republicans say the coronavirus shutdown cannot go on. Car-honking activists swarmed a statehouse Wednesday to protest stay-home restrictions. Capitol Hill staff are quietly drafting bills to undo the just-passed rescue aid and push Americans back to work. Behind President Donald Trump's effort to accelerate re-opening the U.S. economy during the pandemic is a contingent of GOP allies eager to have his back. “It’s very much time to start having that conversation and start figuring that out,” said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who has shared his views with Trump. The push to revive the economy is being influenced and amplified by a potent alliance of big money business interests, religious freedom conservatives and small-government activists, some with direct dial to Trump. They are gaining currency as a counter-point to the health professionals who warn of potentially deadly consequences from easing coronavirus stay-home restrictions too soon. The mobilization is reminiscent of the tea party rebellion a decade ago, when conservatives roared against federal intervention in recession recovery. It’s drawing a similar band of deficit hawks alarmed by the $2.2 trillion rescue package, religious congregants who say their right to worship is being violated and conservative lawmakers warning of a slide toward big government “socialism” with expanded safety net programs. “How do you rein in some of the tyrannical enforcement?” said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, in a radio interview. Economist Stephen Moore is leading a new coalition to fire up activists nationwide.

SUNSET, La. (AP) — A 12-year-old girl has died after a crash with a tractor in Louisiana. Louisiana State Police say Harley Lacomb, of Arnaudville, was riding in a car that was hit by the tractor around noon Tuesday on a road near Sunset, news outlets reported. The tractor was being used to grade a private road when it entered the highway’s eastbound lane. The front-loader attachment on the tractor hit the vehicle's windshield and the 12-year-old Lacomb was killed, authorities said. The driver of the car was wearing a seatbelt but suffered moderate injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital. Lacomb was also wearing a seatbelt. The St. Landry Parish Coroner's Office pronounced her dead at the scene. The tractor's driver, 60-year-old Craig Comeaux, of Sunset, was ejected and also transported to an area hospital with moderate injuries. Neither driver is suspected of being under the influence, but toxicology samples were taken for analysis, authorities said.

What did he catch on film? The photos are inconclusive to say the least. Is this a hoax or is there anything more to it? Interestingly, on February 23, 1975, of that same year two 7-year-old boys named Masato Kawano and Katsuhiro Yamahata, were out roller skating in the early evening hours in Kofu City, Yamanashi Prefecture, when they claim that they saw in the sky a pair of luminous orange lights that flickered and made a strange “ticking sound.” As they looked on in amazement, one of the lights apparently moved off towards the distant mountains, while the other started to descend towards the ground nearby. The boys claimed that they went off to investigate, and saw the strange craft come down to rest in a small vineyard behind an old, abandoned estate. The craft was described as being a domed disc around 15 feet in diameter and 7 feet high, which rested upon three ball-shaped legs. The surface of the strange object was silver-colored, and appeared to have characters or letters of some sort etched upon it. The loud ticking sound of the craft was very pronounced as they drew closer, sounding somewhat reminiscent of a Geiger counter. As the two boys pondered what they were seeing, a hatch purportedly opened on the side out of nowhere and a ladder extended towards the ground, after which a strange looking being climbed out.

And then we noticed just fewer and fewer passengers.
 I was being very proactive. I remember picking up trash and just making sure everything was as clean as could be for the next passengers that were coming on board, making sure everything was picked up, everyone's wipes and gloves and whatever was shoved into the seat pocket.
 ## The first day that I felt symptoms (Thursday, March 19), I woke up and I didn't feel sick -- I just felt like something was off
 I had been working so much that I just thought I was tired. I'd been busting my butt flying because I didn't know what was going to happen in the next few months. And as soon as I got home, it was like my body shut down. I had body chills. I felt like I was running a temperature, and was just exhausted. So, I got home and I went to bed. I took my temperature later that evening and it was about 102 F. I took some Tylenol and slept through the night.
 Usually, I bounce back. Usually, if I get sick like that, I do exactly what I did then: I take some Tylenol, I go to bed, I wake up the next day, and I'm completely fine. But here, the next day when I woke up it was just the same thing, and I just thought, "This is so weird. I don't get sick."
 I called my primary care doctor that Friday and asked if I could get tested, and they said I needed more symptoms because I didn't have any breathing issues, tightness in my chest, or anything like that. The following day, I still had the fever and I had a tiny bit of tightening in my chest when I would cough or breathe in deep.
