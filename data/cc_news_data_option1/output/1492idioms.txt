Originally, a timeline for deciding the fate of LEES was expected by the end of the current school year.
 However, an engineer is working to design a septic system for LEES, similar to that of Lacey Spring Elementary School just a few miles down the road, that if doable and affordable, could keep Linville-Edom open, said School Board Chairman Lowell Fulk.
 But that decision is months down the road and nothing is certain at this time. The design for the septic system is called a clean discharge system. The water would be cleaned and then would need to flow into a stream with a certain amount of constant movement, Fulk said.
 Linville-Edom has such a stream nearby to make the system a possibility. But there are a number of factors that could prevent the school division from going down this path ‚Äî firstly, the system will have to be approved by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Scheikl said. This process can take up to four months because of public hearings and other formalities.

Dear Dave,   I own a small company, and we lease the building we operate from. As an entrepreneur, how do you know when it is time to stop leasing and buy a place of your own?   Peter
 Dear Peter,   You should only buy a building when you have a solid track record of success, and a really good idea of what your building needs will be. A growing business is always a good thing, but you don't want to focus too much on real estate and not enough on generating revenue and managing that growth intelligently. You would also want to make sure you're going to be in anything you buy for a good, long while.
 I'm a big fan of leasing the first few years after starting your own business. It's even better if you can work out of your home, but I understand that's not always practical. Down the road, you can choose to lease with an option to buy, or, in the right situation, just buy a building.
 Remember, make sure you do it all with cash. Don't add debt to the equation!   Dave
 Is it ever too late?   Dear Dave,   Life insurance is one of those things I always said I would get around to buying someday, but, for various reasons, I just haven't done it yet. Is there ever a time when it is too late to get life insurance?   Angie
 Dear Angie,   First of all, I only recommend level term life insurance. It's fairly easy to get until around age 70, depending on your overall health situation. Once you get into your seventies and beyond, however, it can be more difficult to find reasonably priced coverage.
 I recommend that most people have 10 to 12 times their annual income in term life insurance. To be honest, though, you really shouldn't need life insurance if you're 70 or older. At that point, if you've saved and invested wisely over the years, you can be self-insured. By this, I mean you've got enough money in savings and investments to cover funeral expenses - plus enough for a spouse to live on comfortably after you're gone.
 Don't wait any longer, Angie. Take care of this today!   Dave

 The field weight of the methamphetamine they discovered was 74 grams.
 In the second case, Ziegler was sentenced to a term of 1-2 years for possession of ephedrine with the intent to make methamphetamine and 1-2 years for possession of a controlled substance.
 This re-sentencing took place after he violated the terms of his earlier probation.
 In this second case, a search warrant was issued for the residence where Ziegler was living. During that search, many components of making methamphetamine were discovered (according to court documents) including empty lithium battery packages, bottles of muriatic acid, a five-gallon bucket of ammonia, a used syringe, a metal spoon with meth on it, a coffee filter containing meth, unused syringes, empty packs of pseudoephedrine, and more.

A famous upset appeared on the cards when Atdhe Nuhiu's 15th-minute opener put Wednesday ahead in the third-round tie at the Etihad Stadium.
 However, the Championship side's brave resistance was ended when birthday boy Milner finished a well-worked move in the 66th minute.
 And the England international completed the turnaround for the Premier League champions in the closing stages when he turned in David Silva's low cross from close range.
 The result was just reward for City's relentless second-half pressure, but cruel on a Wednesday side who battled valiantly and will consider themselves unfortunate to have missed out on a replay.
 But visiting head coach Stuart Gray - whose side sit 10th in the Championship - can take heart from an improved showing from their last visit to the Etihad, which resulted in a 7-0 drubbing.
 City dictated the tempo in the early stages and Jesus Navas fired an early warning shot with a half-volley that sailed over the crossbar.
 However, it was Wednesday who took a surprise early lead.
 Kieran Lee sent Stevie May free down the right flank and the Scotland international squared to strike partner Nuhiu, who confidently slotted home a first-time shot from the edge of the penalty area.
 City pressed in search of an equaliser, but they were regularly denied by a stubborn Wednesday defence.
 The hosts went close to a leveller in the 26th minute when Frank Lampard - who scored twice in the League Cup victory over Wednesday - placed a shot narrowly wide of the left-hand post from 20 yards with Chris Kirkland rooted to the spot.
 Wednesday appeared content to protect their lead and utilise the counter- attack and May curled a rare shot wide from distance.
 City ended the half with a tentative penalty claim when Milner was nudged to ground by Liam Palmer, but referee Michael Oliver was uninterested.
 The home side initially continued to struggled after the break, although they did start to threaten with a flurry of dangerous balls into the area that failed to yield a positive outcome.
 Manuel Pellegrini was forced to chance his arm on the hour with the introduction of Samir Nasri and David Silva from the bench.
 And the changes proved pivotal as City restored parity midway through the second half.
 Nasri played the ball into Silva, who in turn flicked an exquisite pass into the path of Milner on the left of the area and his drilled shot went through the legs of Kirkland.
 Buoyed by the leveller and with Wednesday dropping deeper, City pressed in search of a winner with Yaya Toure shooting straight at Kirkland and a last- ditch tackle from Tom Lees denying Milner a second.
 Wednesday were having to withstand increasing pressure and Kirkland produced a superb one-handed save to deny Silva in the 90th minute.
 However, it would not prove enough as soon after Silva once more provided an assist with a cross from the right that Milner poked home, with Wednesday's appeals for offside falling on deaf ears.

Read this again‚Äî4.7-inches. Yes, the iPhone SE second-generation gets a 4.7-inch display, an IPS LCD while at it. That‚Äôs the same as the Apple iPhone 8 from a few years ago. In a way, the design and the shell are very reminiscent of that phone from the days gone by. Nothing wrong in that, because the iPhone 8 was an excellent phone to hold and use. At 4.7-inches, this is one of the rare compact smartphones in this day and age‚Äîwhen smartphones are becoming larger and those who prefer compact phones are left with very few options. And I know a lot of people who still would prefer compact smartphones and aren‚Äôt entirely comfortable using the large screen blocks that smartphones have become. There could be the argument that the iPhone 8 Plus size, with its 5.5-inch display would have been ideal. But well, that is a call which Apple had to take. If you look at it from the perspective of variation, that would have perhaps gotten too close to the 6.1-inch display that the iPhone 11 and the still-very-much-on-sale iPhone XR offer. Surely, Apple has the data to prove that people still want a compact smartphone option.

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to delay the launch of England's new cricket competition The Hundred by a year, placing Australians' involvement in some doubt.
 Steve Smith, David Warner, Mitchell Starc and Aaron Finch are among 10 Australian male players who signed up for the domestic league in England, which will feature a format consisting of 100-ball innings.
 Some eight members of Australia's XI from the recent Twenty20 World Cup final were confirmed starters in the women's Hundred.
 Simon Katich is one of five Australian head coaches in the eight-team men's tournament, the maiden season of which was set to run from July 18 until August 16.
 But the growing expectation is it will be pushed back to 2021 as cricket tours and events continue to be affected by the health crisis, including this week's indefinite postponement of the Indian Premier League (IPL).
 The United Kingdom remains in shutdown and its coronavirus death toll was 12,868 on Thursday.
 The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is mulling whether it will be practical or possible to play some games without crowds during its home summer, including Australia's limited-overs tour.
 However, the chief focus of The Hundred was to bring new fans through the gate and that will almost certainly be impossible this year.
 "There has been a lot of speculation about The Hundred, given it's a new tournament, that it probably doesn't make sense for it to be played in front of empty stadiums if it was OK to play in that July window," Katich told SEN.
 "So there has been speculation about it potentially being delayed until next season.
 "I've got no problem with that and I think a lot of people would think that's probably the way to go, if things keep tracking the way they are in the UK."
 Shane Warne, Darren Lehmann, Andrew McDonald and Tom Moody are the other Australian coaches involved in the men's Hundred.
 Securing their availability in 2021 should be straightforward, with the possible exception of McDonald given he is Australia's senior assistant and has already been earmarked as Justin Langer's likely successor.
 But the same can't be said of the 10 Australian players given how congested the international calender will likely be in 2021.
 The International Cricket Council (ICC) faces an incredibly difficult job attempting to rejig the Future Tour Programme and squeeze in the various games that will be scrapped because of COVID-19.
 The ICC's most pressing issue is deciding whether to delay, cancel or continue with this year's Twenty20 World Cup.
 It was set to be held in Australia during October-November; dates that IPL organisers are eyeing off as a potential window for that tournament.

Either by re-purposing or enhancing their current business models, at least two First Coast companies are combating the COVID-19 virus by offering deep cleaning and disinfecting for homes and commercial properties.
   
 Turner Pest Control has added the home cleaning to its pest and termite bonds, and ServPro stepped up its services to include a more thorough cleansing and disinfecting. In both cases they're responding to an increased public demand that one area builder said brings piece of mind to new home buyers.
   
 COMPLETE COVERAGE | Coronavirus in Florida
   
 "How good would it feel to open the door to a home you just closed on and know that everything is completely clean," said Chris Shee, owner of MasterCraft Builder Group, which currently has 50 homes under construction in St. Johns County. "It bodes very well for new construction."
   
 Wade Wilson, technical director for Turner, worked with company President Bill Talon to quickly pivot and add home cleaning to their business.
   
 "We followed this closely and when we started to see [the coronavirus] appear, we got together and decided we needed to come up with a solution," said Wilson, a retired Marine who has been with Turner 32 years. "It's not about making money. I look at it like the nation is under attack and being a veteran you do what you can to help. Our community is in danger. Let's come up with a solution."
   
 Shee, who has used Turner for his termite bonds and pest treatment in new homes, said he got an email from a Turner sales representative last week about a service that takes 90 minutes to two hours would involve spraying an entire home with Nisus DSV, a disinfectant that the EPA has determined is effective against SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of COVID-19.
   
 The disinfectant is safe for all surfaces and dries within two hours. Studies have shown that Nisus DSV kills pathogens within seconds and has been used by governments around the world and is listed in the biosecurity guides of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization.
   
 "It's a very cool idea," Shee said. "The more we thought about it, the more we thought it was the right thing to do."
   
 It wasn't the most difficult of transitions for Turner. The company already had hazardous material suits and equipment, and it was a matter of training a team to apply the disinfectant.
   
 "We had a disaster recovery plan in place, and we worked quickly, within a week, and got them turned around," said Stacy McKinney, Turner's marketing director.
   
 Wilson said teams have been organized in Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa. The employees fill out a health questionnaire and the company uses only those who are 40 years old or younger.
   
 "We didn't want to put anyone with an underlying health risk out there," Wilson said.
   
 ServPro, which already did deep cleaning for homes and businesses, has experienced a 45 percent increase in business related to COVID-19, according to Chandler St. Peter, operations manager for ServPro of Jacksonville South and ServPro of Arlington/Jacksonville East.
   
 However, the deep cleaning/disinfecting was already part of the company's services.
   
 "We are prepared to clean and disinfect businesses and homes, according to protocols set forth by the Centers for Disease Control," St. Peter said. "For a confirmed case of COVID-19, we provide enhanced cleaning services and are required to wipe down all high-touch surfaces. We will then fog or spray the area and let the product dwell for up to 15 minutes depending on the disinfectant being used."
   
 They're not done yet.
   
 "We then go through the space to wipe all surfaces from 8 feet down," he said. "Our technicians have been trained for this. We adhere to the highest cleaning and sanitization standards and we are experienced in treating bio concerns like MRSA, Norovirus, C-diff and even your typical flu. Protocol for dwell time and Personal Protective Equipment will vary between jobs but cleaning protocol remains similar."
   
 Turner said the deep-cleaning services will last far beyond the current crisis.
   
 "It's here to stay," Wilson said. "After what the nation and the world has gone through, it will be a service we continue to provide."
   
 Both companies declined to provide estimates of their home services and said they would supply that information to customers who contact them directly for a quote or obtain a quote from their websites.

Walters became the first Stoke player to record a treble in the Premier League when he headed home in stoppage time at the Britannia Stadium, adding to his two first-half strikes.
 The 31-year-old has not always been a first-team regular this season under Hughes, but after his 'perfect' hat-trick the Stoke boss hinted he may still earn a new contract, with his current deal set to expire in June.
 He said: "On the day he was magnificent, a credit to his profession, he gives everything every game and on his 200th appearance it was fitting he won the game for us.
 "He's going the right way about it [getting a new deal], I'm sure they'll be discussions nearer the time.
 "I'm just delighted for him, he probably doesn't get enough credit for what he does on the field, his ability is second to none."
 Hughes felt Stoke deserved to take all three points from Harry Redknapp's side on the day, but rued a defensive slip that gave the visitors hope before Walters completed his treble.
 "We're pleased with the result, performance wise it was not a great game, but it was difficult for both teams," he added.
 "I thought we used conditions well, we were good value at 2-0 and probably could have had more, but then a lapse allowed them to get a goal back.
 "Thankfully, we repelled everything they put into the box and in the end it was fitting that Walters has scored the third goal to take the game away from them."

Long-serving captain Gerrard announced on Friday that he will move to Major League soccer at the end of the season after 26 years at Anfield.
 The former England skipper holds legendary status at the Merseyside club and his decision to leave came as a body blow to Liverpool supporters.
 All the talk ahead of Monday's FA Cup third round tie has understandably been of Gerrard's exit and manager Brendan Rodgers will be eager to ensure the midfielder's departure has not taken his side's eye off the ball.
 League Two outfit Wimbledon's finest hour came when they sensationally won the FA Cup final in 1988 with a 1-0 victory over Liverpool at Wembley.
 Lawrie Sanchez's header stunned Kenny Dalglish's Division One champions with one of the biggest upsets in the history of the famous competition.
 That uncompromising Wimbledon side, nicknamed 'The Crazy Gang', caused opponents all sorts of problems with their physical approach and the current team have a powerhouse of their own who will make his presence felt.
 Adebayo Akinfenwa is a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but the 16-stone burly striker will put any affinity to the Premier League club to one side at Kingsmeadow.
 Akinfenwa, nicknamed 'The Beast', has scored nine goals for Neal Ardley's side this season and Liverpool must counter the threat posed by the 32-year-old as they attempt to secure their place in the fourth round.
 The former Northampton Town striker is relishing the prospect of coming up against Rodgers' team and is determined to spring a surprise.
 He is quoted as saying on getwestlondon.co.uk‚Äé: "It doesn't get any bigger than this. To play against my boyhood team will be the highlight of my career.
 "John Barnes was my idol growing up and he‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôve supported Liverpool. I play nothing like him though!
 "I‚Äôve only been to Anfield once, I couldn't really afford to get up there when I was younger, so on a personal level it would have been nice to have the tie played there. Our best chance to win is to have the game here. We prefer to have it here as a team."
 Liverpool have lost just one of their last 11 games in all competitions, but made a disappointing start to the year by drawing 2-2 with struggling Leicester City on New Year's Day after being two goals up at half-time.
 Gerrard scored both goals from the penalty spot against Nigel Pearson's side and it remains to be seen if he will feature against Wimbledon or whether Rodgers will rest the 34-year-old.
 Wimbledon, who have won their last two games and sit 11th in League Two, are set to welcome back Sammy Moore after he recovered from illness.
 Dejan Lovren could be recalled to the Liverpool side, while fellow defender Martin Skrtel is available after serving a suspension and Mario Balotelli will be hoping to play some part after he was not even on the bench against Leicester.

Per Mertesacker and the impressive Alexis Sanchez scored the goals as the holders claimed a third round triumph at Emirates Stadium in a re-run of last May's final.
 Hull centre-back Curtis Davies was the only player retained from the 2-0 New Year's Day win over Everton - a triumph that came at a signifiant price.
 Before kick-off, City confirmed that defenders Andrew Robertson (ankle ligaments) and Liam Rosenior (hamstring tendon) are set for lengthy absences, along with midfielder Gaston Ramirez (adductor), with all injuries sustained against Roberto Martinez's side.
 Rosenior will be out of 10 to 12 weeks, with Robertson and Ramirez facing four to six weeks on the sidelines.
 Bruce highlighted these problems as a reason for his team selection and insisted the changes were not intended to play down the importance of the FA Cup to his club.
 "We made 10 changes with all the injuries we have got, and that wasn't a case of disrespecting the cup because we had one of the best days of our lives in the competition last year," he said.
 "It was always going to be difficult once we picked them [Arsenal] out of the hat."
 Bruce conceded that Hull lacked quality in attack on Sunday and expressed a tentative interest in securing the services of Jermain Defoe on loan - the former England striker who is currently plying his trade in the MLS for Toronto FC.
 "If we're going to be honest Arsenal deserved to win," he told the BBC. "Unfortunately, up the top end of the pitch we were unable to create anything.
 "The disappointing thing for me is that the first goal is the first we've conceded from a corner. We should be doing better than that.
 "We battled on valiantly but we weren't quite good enough."
 Addressing the Defoe link at his post-match press conference, Bruce added: "He [Defoe] might be too expensive. If there is a chance we would be interested in him.
 "But I don't want to get the hopes up of all the Hull supporters. There is a long way to go."

Gold rebounded after initial declines on Thursday, bolstered by safe haven demand as weak retail sales and manufacturing data out of the United States heightened fears of a deep global recession due to the coronavirus. Spot gold rose 0.4 per cent to $1,722.02 per ounce by 0704 GMT, erasing losses driven by profit-booking and a stronger dollar earlier in the session. US gold futures rose 0.9 per cent to $1,755.50. The overall upward trend for gold has not changed, said Avtar Sandu, senior commodities manager at Phillip Futures. If you look at the bigger picture, (economic) data is bad, which means you get another few more rounds of quantitative easing, and central banks would definitely keep interest rates low in this weak environment, he said. US retail sales suffered a record drop in March and output at factories declined by the most since 1946, raising concerns that the economy contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace in decades as measures to control the spread of the virus weighed. Japanese business confidence plunged to fresh decade lows in April, while British retail spending slumped by more than a quarter during the first two weeks of lockdown measures. Governments and central banks around the world have unleashed unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus and other support for economies floored by the pandemic. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. Gold also tends to benefit from widespread stimulus from central banks, as it is seen as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. While gold will continue to be in demand, sometimes investors need funds to cover their margin calls, so losses in other financial assets might lead to falls in the gold price, said John Sharma, economist at National Australia Bank. World stock markets fell, while the dollar extended gains after a plunge in US retail sales and factory production and increasing gloomy economic outlooks for Asia. However, Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note that he was now unsure whether gold was still correlating to stock markets or running its usual inverted correlation to the US Dollar. This evening's US Initial Jobs data may give us more of a clue to that quandary, with weak data almost certainly sending Wall Street lower. While gold usually gains from reduced risk appetite, the metal has, on occasion, moved in tandem with stock markets recently, with sharp selloffs in wider markets prompting investors to sell precious metals to cover their losses elsewhere. The US jobs data is due at 1230 GMT. Palladium gained 1.7 per cent to $2,216.56 an ounce, while silver rose 0.2 per cent to $15.51 per ounce and platinum was up 1 per cent to $787.27.

Absolutely, that s what you need at that stage of your career (push from Ganguly). When you re starting your careers at the international level, you need all the support you can and then it will be upto you to shape your career. But that initial support is very vital, Zaheer Khan told Gaurav Kapur in a YouTube chat show. Both of them have led India for a long time. With MS (Dhoni), I have seen that change as well. When MS got the team, he had a lot of senior players who were experienced at the international level. So he didn t have to do much in terms of getting them up to speed. But once all those guys started retiring, when the young batch came in, he played a similar kind of role, did similar kind of things to what Dada was doing with the young lot. In Indian cricket, every decade the captain has passed baton to the next in line and the person who has taken the baton has led to the team to the next level, Zaheer added.

The last few weeks of college are usually spent celebrating and saying goodbye to all the friends and professors who made the experience worthwhile.
   
 Now Flagler College students are forced to finish out the rest of the year online due to the coronavirus, causing seniors to miss out on important end- of-year traditions.
   
 "I definitely feel a bit disconnected. It's disheartening to have your college experience taken away from you and there's nothing you can do about it," senior Karina Quinones said. "You feel like you have a few months to go to those last few events and say thank you for the experience, so it's hard but you have to be grateful for all of it."
    The Record is providing this important health information for free. Help support our journalism. SUBSCRIBE HERE.  
 Flagler College strongly encouraged students to return to their permanent homes to self-isolate, but the residence halls, dining room and library remain open to students. Still, the school has turned into a "ghost town," with only a few students left on campus.
   
 "I'm with freshmen girls and they get a little rowdy sometimes, so it's weird not hearing the girly chatter down the hallway," said Kim LaPorte, a community advisor in one of the on-campus residence halls. "I think we had 60-something residents just in my hallway, and I think there might be four left. It's very strange being on campus with no one here."
   
 But just because the residents are holed up inside their dorms doesn't mean they are socializing. Resident Assistant Zachary Corbitt and his coworkers are hosting virtual hang-outs to keep students connected, especially when mental health is at risk during isolation.
   
 "We acknowledge that this is a very stressful time and there are people who may not necessarily be able to deal with the emotions that it causes, so without overstepping our boundaries into counseling services, we're just trying to mitigate those negative feelings by offering opportunities for social interaction," Corbitt said.
   
 So far they've held a Zoom meeting where students did crafts and drank coffee, and they're thinking about hosting a webinar about how to make videos go viral, the subject of one Flagler College professor's doctorate thesis.
   
 "This is a time where people are resorting to social media, especially TikTok and YouTube, so by offering them the ability or knowledge on how to go viral, we thought students would be interested in that," Corbitt said.
   
 Meanwhile, most students have returned to their childhood homes to ride out the pandemic. While some added family time is nice, some students might be missing their independence a little.
   
 "It's a mix of both," said senior Lauren Piskothy, who is back home in Brooksville. "It is nice to have them around, but I'm still trying to figure out how to navigate being independent while also being home without feeling like a child again. I've been trying to go on walks and riding my bike as my way of being alone."
   
 First year students are also feeling disappointed that they will be missing out on making important connections and experiences. Freshman Presleigh Johnson went home to Texas for spring break, not knowing that she would be stuck there for months.
   
 "I used to be home schooled, so I told my friends, it kind of felt like Flagler was a dream and I woke up and I'm still being home schooled," Johnson said. "I really miss campus, I miss the connection and being with my friends, going to class. Zoom calls are nice, but I really want to talk to my professor and see how energetic they are, because we really feed off their passion and energy."
   
 Flagler College is offering students the option to convert one of more of their classes into a pass or fail grade. A grade of 60 or higher would be a pass, which would not impact a student's GPA, while a fail would negatively impact their GPA. That gives students some leeway if they are dealing with coronavirus-related hardships.
   
 Still, seniors are struggling to end their college career on a high note when their routine has been thrown off. Post-graduation plans are being put on hold until after the shutdown is over, and the Class of 2020 will enter the job market while unemployment is at its highest peak in years, adding even more pressure and uncertainty.
   
 "The economy is falling apart in a sense, stocks are falling, and it's scary to think that I'm going to have to attempt to find a career in a time where jobs are going to be scarce," Corbitt said. "On that end, it's terrifying but I'm happy that I have a family that has offered support and I have a place to go if I need to."
   
 Quinones is planning to move to Miami in August to study clinical psychology, a field that she feels will always be deemed essential, but now it seems to be up in the air whether she will be able to move there during this crisis.
   
 "It definitely puts a strain on things, and I'm honestly not sure if me going in August is still a 100% guarantee," Quinones said. "It's hard to wrap up your life here and then also start a new one in the middle of a pandemic. This is the time where I'd be going to Miami to check out my college and look for apartments, and that's all just been put on hold for now."
   
 While spring commencement isn't happening this year, Flagler students will still get to experience walking across the stage and flipping their tassel from one side to the other. The college is inviting seniors back in December to graduate then. It might not be the same graduation they would've had in May, but it's going to be every bit as celebratory.
   
 "I would like the closure and just being able to see my classmates and say goodbye to undergrad and that part of my life," Piskothy said. "I am grateful to Flagler for that."

Pulis, who worked wonders to keep Crystal Palace in the Premier League last season, has made a promising start to his bid to revive West Brom's fortunes and masterminded a 7-0 thrashing of Conference side Gateshead in the last round.
 The last time West Brom made the short trip to St Andrew's was under the guidance of Roy Hodgson in 2011, when the visitors prevailed 3-1 in a top- flight match.
 That extended West Brom's unbeaten run against their Midlands counterparts to three matches, with Birmingham having last tasted victory in 2006.
 Pulis has been keen to bring in new players during the January transfer window, but has so far been frustrated in his efforts to recruit the likes of winger Callum McManaman from Wigan Athletic and Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher.
 They have one new injury concern ahead of the game against Gary Rowett's Championship side.
 Midfielder James Morrison, who has made 21 appearances for the club so far this season, has a knock and is a doubt.
 Defender Jonas Olsson is still recovering from Achilles surgery, while midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu is on African Cup of Nations duty with Democratic Republic of Congo.
 Birmingham go into Saturday's contest on a four-match unbeaten run, which features three wins, including the 3-2 victory at Blyth Spartans in round three.
 Since Rowett took over as manager for the league game at Wolves on November 1, Birmingham have won eight of 13 matches.
 This has seen them climb from 23rd in the table to 11th, just nine points off the play-off places.
 "All I will do all the time is keep trying to win games of football and keep trying to work very hard in the week with the players and see if we can keep moving forwards in terms of developing the team, developing the philosophy, making the players better if we can, and constantly trying to improve that squad," Rowett told Birmingham's official website.
 One player who has excelled under Rowett and has the chance to further enhance his growing reputation this weekend is winger Demarai Gray.
 The 18-year-old, who has scored four goals in 22 appearances this season, was this week named the Football League's Young Player of the Month for December.

Dublin [Ireland], April 16 (ANI): Warren Deutrom, the Chief Executive of Cricket Ireland, said that the team's upcoming home series against New Zeland and Pakistan are at 'high risk' of getting postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.   With Bangladesh's scheduled tour for three ODIs and four T20Is postponed, the Irish season has already been pushed back to the end of May.   New Zealand are due to play three ODIs and three T20Is from June 19, while Pakistan are scheduled to play two T20Is in July in between series in the Netherlands and England.   "We're all going to have to take a pragmatic approach - we just don't know what's going to happen even if sport does get back up and running in June. With regards to international cricket, we remain in a wait-and-see holding pattern. Clearly, there is a high risk that our men's home series against New Zealand and Pakistan - scheduled for June and July respectively - may be postponed if Government restrictions remain in place," Deutrom said in a statement.   Deutrom further explained the challenges that stand in front of Ireland for completing the scheduled bilateral home series.   "Of course, some of the challenges we face in trying to bring some degree of certainty are no different to any other sport with international opposition - for example, attaining visas for visiting teams and their support staff may not be possible as the Department of Foreign Affairs and the UK Foreign Office are currently not processing visa applications. In addition, each country will take the advice of their home government, so teams may not even be in a position to travel to Europe," Deutrom said.   "More specific to our situation, both New Zealand and Pakistan are visiting multiple countries on their tours, so that adds an extra layer of complexity. Then there are more logistical issues such as hotel and international flight bookings, the movement and staffing of broadcast facilities, and complying with the restrictions that may still exist around large group gatherings," he added.   With regards to supporting domestic cricket and the grassroots game, the Board agreed to Cricket Ireland continuing all regular payments to the Provincial Unions. These payments, made by the national governing body every year, go towards essential running costs including administrative and development officers, rental subsidies, game development programme funding, and costs of supporting coaches and player-support services.

Germany international Ozil has not played since October's defeat at Chelsea due to a knee injury picked up in that Stamford Bridge fixture.
 The playmaker had struggled for form in the early stages of the Premier League season, having seen his pre-season preparations cut short by his involvement in Germany's triumphant World Cup campaign.
 But Wenger believes a spell out of action has reignited the fire in Ozil's game, and he expects big things from the club's record signing with a return on Sunday against Stoke City a possibility.
 "It's a frustrating season for him as he has not contributed yet," Wenger said. "It was not a convincing start. He played six games, scored one goal against Aston Villa.
 "What we pay for today is our slow start of the season because in the first six games of the season we won two games but we dropped too many points.
 "There is now an opportunity to come back into the team and contribute to the team. When you are a football player you want to play games.
 "He is ready. What he is is hungry.
 "They come back from the World Cup and when you come back having won the World Cup, even if I gave them the holiday they needed, the hunger is a bit artificial.
 "You have to be frustrated from competition and slowly get back to realise how much you miss it to come back to normal. I had that before with former players.

Gary Johnson's side were handed a plum draw when paired with United but a difficult fixture may prove even trickier should Louis van Gaal utilise the opportunity to give some of his recovering stars an outing.
 Recent recruits Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo, who cost over ¬£100 million combined, are all nearing returns to action following injury lay- offs, with the likes of Adnan Januzaj, Rafael da Silva and James Wilson also pushing for a place in the XI.
 One player on the comeback trail is left-back Luke Shaw, who is likely to play in the absence of Ashley Young - who suffered a hamstring injury at Stoke City on New Year's Day.
 "I need game time now," Shaw told the club's official website. "I had 60 minutes against Stoke and that was pre-planned.
 "If I had been able to go on longer then I would have done, but I think the main thing for me now is to get a run of games together.
 "It was a great feeling watching the team do well [in my absence]. We always want to win the games and now I am back fit I want to be a part of the winning run."
 Van Gaal, though, is unlikely to take Yeovil lightly having already overseen an embarrassing 4-0 thrashing at the hands of MK Dons in the League Cup second round.
 Their fortunes have improved significantly since, however, and the 11-time FA Cup winners enter the fixture on the back of a 10-game unbeaten run.
 Yeovil boss Johnson is well aware of the challenge that awaits, although he is still hoping for a "miracle".
 "If the cameras only go to the places where they think there might be an upset, well thanks very much," he told TheFA.com ahead of the televised clash.
 "Of course we'd need a miracle to pull it off, but the FA Cup is the FA Cup, that's the beauty of it.
 "It‚Äôs 11 men against 11 men and on the day nobody knows what's going to happen. Everybody thinks they know, but nobody knows for sure.
 "Man United is the biggest draw in that third round what most people would be looking for ‚Äì and now it's our turn.
 "We played Liverpool 10 years ago, and Arsenal 10 years before that. But Man United was the draw we all wanted so it was a moment of great excitement."
 The sides have previously met twice before in the competition, the last of those fixtures resulting in an 8-0 win for United in September 1949 after then-Southern League side Yeovil had eliminated First Division high rollers Sunderland in the previous round.

Davies skippered the City XI that was beaten 3-2 in a thrilling finale against Arsenal at Wembley last year, and the sides will now lock horns again as the big guns enter the tournament at the third round stage.
 The centre-back admits Hull are on something of a revenge mission, even if he does not think such thoughts will be occupying their minds during the game.
 "You do have, in the back of your mind, that thought that they killed my dream and made me cry," he said. "But when you go into the game, the whole idea of revenge goes out the window."
 James Chester and Davies appeared to have put Hull on course for their first major honour when their goals earned a 2-0 lead inside eight minutes of the clash in May.
 But Santi Cazorla and Laurent Koscielny forced extra time before Aaron Ramsey struck in the 109th minute to ensure Arsene Wenger's men were victorious.
 Hull head into Sunday's fixture with confidence having picked up crucial Premier League wins over Sunderland and Everton over the festive period.
 Yet Bruce is counting the cost of their most recent win, with Abel Hernandez (fatigue), Gaston Ramirez (groin), Liam Rosenior (hamstring) and Andrew Robertson (ankle) adding to an injury list featuring Mohamed Diame (knee) centre-back Michael Dawson (hamstring).
 That means he will be forced to make changes against Arsenal, although the manager stressed the importance of the game.
 "In certain departments, it will have to be a different side," said Bruce. "I'll see what bodies I've got. But we're playing Arsenal in a big cup-tie."
 The hope for Bruce, who won the FA Cup three times as a player, is that Sunday represents the start of a journey that sees his men repeat the heroics of last year.
 He added: "It was a great day for everybody and we were close. Everybody will remember what a great spectacle it was."
 Bruce's opposite number Wenger is also hampered by several injuries, with Ramsey (hamstring), Mikel Arteta, Abou Diaby (both calf), Mesut Ozil (knee) and Jack Wilshere (ankle) sidelined.
 A lack of midfield options saw defender Calum Chambers moved into an unfamiliar role alongside Francis Coquelin for Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Southampton.
 Danny Welbeck could return from a thigh problem, while fellow striker Olivier Giroud will serve the final leg of a three-game suspension following his red card against QPR.
 "I will make a few changes, that's for sure," Wenger explained after the St Mary's Stadium setback.

There was great hope with which everyone looked towards Cupertino, because it was meant to be the affordable iPhone which many were craving for.

 The move will see Gerrard play his football away from Liverpool for the first time in his career, and the 34-year-old is ready to embrace a new way of life.
 "The biggest challenge will be settling in," he told the Galaxy website. "I've lived in Liverpool all my life. I'm a Scouser through and through, I love my city and I'm proud of my roots.
 "But you only get one life and it's important to try different things, new experiences.
 "It's also a big thing for my children as well, to take them out of their comfort zone and give them a life experience that will hopefully help them develop as humans.
 "It's perfect timing for this new challenge and I'm really excited and looking forward to it."
 Explaining the reasons why he chose the Galaxy, Gerrard added: "Their pursuing me was very aggressive.
 "The talks I've had with them have been very positive.
 "They basically told me what I wanted to hear, told me about the winning mentality at the club, told me what their aims and goals are for the future and it basically suited me at this stage in my career.
 "I'll be going over there to hopefully win more medals and to finish my career over there.
 "It's really exciting both on and off the pitch, but the most important thing is that I go there and it's a success on the pitch."

Tottenham had gone seven games without defeat in all competitions prior to Saturday's 2-1 loss at Crystal Palace in Alan Pardew's first game in charge of their London rivals.
 While Belgium international Chadli - scorer in the 1-1 draw at Turf Moor eight days ago - was disappointed to see that streak come to an end, he sees the Lancashire club's visit to White Hart Lane on Wednesday as an opportunity to kick-start another strong run of form.
 He told Tottenham's official website: "I thought we were in control at 1-0 [against Palace] but after the penalty we were not in the game anymore and that's a big disappointment for everyone.
 "Like we did before, after a loss we have to make things clear again and make a fresh start - and that's what we going to do."
 Meanwhile, Burnley are beginning to show that they belong in the Premier League and followed up the stalemate with Tottenham with a 2-1 win over QPR that lifted them out of the bottom three.
 Most would expect Burnley's focus to be on their quest to ensure top-flight survival.
 However, Scott Arfield, who netted the opening goal versus QPR, is adamant that Sean Dyche's men will be doing everything they can to try to keep hopes of a cup run intact.
 "The next clutch of games are important but none more so than the next one which is Tottenham away," Arfield told Burnley's official website.
 "It's the FA Cup and that‚Äôs what you want to be involved in so we certainly won't be going down there to make up the numbers.
 "It's no less important than today's [Saturday} win so we'll go there [Tottenham] and try to win."
 Tottenham have little in the way of injury concerns, although Erik Lamela and Ryan Mason are both unavailable along with Nabil Bentaleb, who is on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Algeria.
 There are no new worries for a visiting side that will be without defenders Kevin Long (knee), Matthew Taylor (Achilles) and Stephen Ward (ankle).
 However, with a crunch league clash with Palace - above Burnley on goal difference only - on the horizon on Saturday, it will be intriguing to see whether Dyche's team selection holds true to the sentiments of midfielder Arfield.

Scottish government changes to the Small Business Grant scheme were to plug a gaping hole where chains of outlets had been left a long way short of both what many need and what they'd get in England.
 The changes were cautiously welcomed by business, as a sign at least that they've been listened to.
 A full grant for the first property and 75% for each of the next ones could be a life-saver for chains of pubs, restaurants, grocers and bakers. That 75% is an improvement on zero.
 But some won't be satisfied until it gets to the 100% grant for each property, as in England.
 Others are waiting for the small print, or just waiting. The speed at which grants come through is putting strains on those without much cash in hand.
 While that is costed at ¬£120m, another ¬£100m has been found in the magic money forest for those who have fallen through the cracks in other schemes.
