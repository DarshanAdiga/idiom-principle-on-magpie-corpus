Jillian Connolly, Project Manager for Get Blackpool Reading said: “After a successful bus tour to launch the new Get Blackpool Reading campaign last week, we’re delighted to be getting on board with Blackpool Transport’s Reading Route. We know that reading for just 10 minutes a day is enough to improve a child’s happiness and literacy development. We hope bus users and families across the town will enjoy their brand new books, some of which have been kindly donated by Penguin, and that this book-sharing scheme will encourage the whole town to fall in love with reading.”

The incoming Governor of the Bank of England Bailey would like to see what the Chancellor of the Exchequer has to offer at the March 11 budget before making a decision as to any monetary policy change. Another factor for the GBP outlook is the talks between the EU and the UK on their post-Brexit relationship, according to analysts at Rabobank. Key quotes "The incoming Governor of the Bank of England Bailey suggested that an immediate policy move from the BoE may not be on the cards. The possibility of a brief delay in a BoE rate cut has allowed GBP to edge back to firmer levels." "The UK budget was expected to be focussed on 'levelling up' and 'unleashing' the UK economy. There are now reports that it will instead focus on measures aimed at protecting and supporting parts of the economy most likely to be affected by a coronavirus epidemic." "Given the risks that the BoE will cut rates this month, the pound's respite could be temporary." "The threat made by PM Johnson that he would be prepared to walk away from the talks and open the UK to WTO rules on trade at the start of next year, is likely to keep GBP investors worried." "We expect GBP/USD to trade mainly below 1.30 on both a 1 and 3-month view."

When Cardenal came to Delhi in March 1983 to attend the Seventh Non-aligned Summit as Nicaragua’s minister for culture, Nautiyal was deputed to liaison between him and the Indian government. When he told Cardenal that he had translated some of his poems from Spanish into Hindi and that he was a beloved of young Hindi poets, he could not believe it. He was under the impression that nobody in India knew who he was. So, the next day, Nautiyal showed Cardenal the November 1978 issue of Hindi magazine “Sarokaar” that had carried Nautiyal’s translation of his celebrated poem “Salmon”. Although Cardenal did not understand a word of Hindi, he asked Nautiyal to read out the translation and asked if he could take the magazine with him back to Nicaragua – a request that Nautiyal happily acceded to. Cardenal also signed a poem for him.
 Eminent poet Mangalesh Dabral, who was among those who led the Award Wapasi movement in 2015 to protest the Modi government’s silence on the targeted killings of public intellectuals and writers, also had a similarly interesting experience with Cardenal that showed how simple a man he was despite his international stature. He had returned from Bhopal after attending a World Poetry Festival at Bharat Bhavan and there was a function at the Nicaraguan Embassy to celebrate his birthday on January 20, 1989. Dabral was the literary editor of Hindi daily “Jansatta” and his poet-cartoonist colleague Rajendra Dhodapkar had given him a blank paper to get it signed by Cardenal as he wanted to draw a cartoon of the revolutionary poet. When Dabral spread the blank sheet before him and asked him to sign, Cardenal took out and his pen and was about to sign when embassy officials stopped him, pointing out how he could sign a blank paper.
 ## A born poet
 Dabral too had translated a few of Cardenal’s poems and he gave him the issue of Hindi magazine “Tanaav” that had published them. Cardenal was very happy and he sent him some of his poems after returning to Nicaragua. In 2017, Hindi journal “Rachana Samay” published Dabral’s translation of 80 of Cardenal’s poems.
 If poets are born and not made, Cardenal was truly a born poet. He began writing verse when he was a small boy of four years. Later, he once said that he could not remember a time when he did not write. He wrote against American imperialism but there is not a word in his writings that is directed against the American people. In this sense, he represented revolutionary universalism that aims to unite all the suffering people of the world by creating bonds among them. His poem “Zero Hour” bears some resemblance with a long poem of Firaq Gorakhpuri titled “Aadhi Raat” (Midnight), especially because of its recurring refrain:
 Watchman! What hour is it of the night?
 Watchman! What hour is it of the night?
 Perhaps, secular fundamentalists and doctrinaire Marxists of today can learn something from Father Cardenal. He was a deeply religious man who defied the Church and Pope John Paul II. And, he was a Marxist, who as a revolutionary poet did not fight shy of learning the art of poetry from a self-proclaimed fascist like Ezra Pound. Cardenal is Dead. Long live Cardenal!

CATANZARO - “Nessuno resti escluso”. E’ il grido d’allarme lanciato dal Segretario Generale Fisascat Cisl Calabria, Fortunato Lo Papa in merito alla mancata internalizzazione di centinaia di lavoratori calabresi (4 mila a livello Nazionale) coinvolti negli appalti di pulizie e decoro nelle scuole. “Sono stati internalizzati – spiega il Segretario Cislino – circa 12 mila lavoratori in tutta Italia un risultato positivo raggiunto anche per l’azione decisiva della Fisascat Cisl, Filcams Cgil e Uiltrasporti Uil ma oggi ci sono anche 4 mila lavoratori senza lavoro e senza salario, centinaia nella nostra Regione che non possono rimanere inascoltati e nell’ombra”. “Domani infatti – prosegue Lo Papa - si terrà dalle ore 10 un sit-in di protesta dinanzi l’Ufficio scolastico Regionale di Catanzaro di tutti i lavoratori della Calabria rimasti esclusi. E’ inaccettabile – aggiunge il Segretario della Fisascat Cisl Calabria - che un percorso positivo che vede riconosciuto a tante lavoratrici e lavoratori un ruolo diretto nella scuola, percorso che abbiamo voluto e contribuito a realizzare, si concluda con l’esclusione e la perdita di lavoro e salario di moltissimi lavoratori calabresi”. “La protesta di domani si rende necessaria – continua il cislino – per le mancate responsabilità di un Governo che non si è mi interessato concretamente alla vertenza, di un Ministero dell’Istruzione che non ha fatto abbastanza per ampliare la platea da internalizzare e per mantenere l’orario a tempo pieno, di un Ministero del Lavoro che non ha proposto ne accettato soluzioni concrete e immediate e delle Imprese coinvolte che interrompendo il confronto hanno impedito la ricerca di soluzioni per i lavoratori”. “La Fisascat – conclude – è vicina e saluta con soddisfazione i tanti lavoratori che hanno iniziato un nuovo percorso di lavoro, ma rimaniamo accanto a tutti gli altri e proseguiamo nella nostra battaglia fino a quando il Governo non darà risposte e soluzioni per la salvaguardia e la continuità di occupazione e di reddito dei tanti lavoratori coinvolti”.

Flybe's network included more than half of British domestic flights outside of London. Europe's largest regional carrier, Flybe had a major presence at airports such as Aberdeen, Belfast City, Manchester and Southampton, and flew some 9 million passengers a year.
 Its links to some difficult-to-reach spots in the U.K. were a strong selling point for the government. But the government's efforts were dogged by allegations from competitors that it had provided state aid to Flybe.
 “This is a sad day for U.K. aviation and we know that Flybe's decision to stop trading will be very distressing for all of its employees and customers," said the chief executive of the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority, Richard Moriarty.
 A consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital bought Flybe in February 2019. Known as Connect Airways, it paid just 2.2 million pounds for Flybe's assets but pledged to inject cash into the airline to turn it around.
 Flybe has struggled with a series of issues, including the weakening of the pound in light of Britain's pending departure from the European Union. The weaker pound hurts airlines like Flybe that have significant costs in dollars but take in revenue in pounds.
 The airline also was struggling to pay its airline passenger duty, a tax on flights that many airline groups have long complained restricts growth.
 It is the second U.K.-based airline in six months to fail after Thomas Cook went bust in September.

USD/JPY has resumed the leg lower in the second half of the week, trading below the 107.00 mark and closer to Wednesday's YTD low at 106.84. Pablo Piovano, an analyst at FXStreet, sees chances to sell in occasional rallies. Key quotes "The resumption of the risk aversion in combination with weaker US yields is favouring the demand for the safe-haven JPY, always against the broader backdrop of unremitting concerns surrounding the COVID-19." "Further easing either by the Fed or other central banks cannot be ruled out, leaving the outlook for the pair somewhat mixed and with the next relevant support in the mid-106.00s." "Occasional rallies in USD/JPY are seen struggling in the 108.35/40 band, where is located the 200-day SMA. By the same token, further weakness is thus expected to materialize when below this key barrier." "The next support of relevance emerges at the October 2019 low in the 106.50 zone ahead of 105.05. On the upside, the pair needs to regain the 200-day SMA, today at 108.37, in order to allow for extra gains."

In hindsight, it is something perhaps we all took for granted. Flybe were committed to embracing the local community and you only have to look at Exeter City message boards on Facebook to see the warmth fans held towards Flybe and the genuine sadness at its demise.

 Having Flybe on board in those early days perhaps helped Exeter City re- establish themselves in the local community as well. And they have without doubt gone from a club that no business would go near in 2003 to one where many businesses are proud to have their name associated with them today.

(AP) - The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 11 with a victim succumbing in California - the first reported fatality outside Washington state.Officials in Placer County, northwest of Sacramento, said Wednesday an elderly adult who tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from a San Francisco-to-Mexico cruise had died. They said the victim had underlying health conditions.Washington also announced another death Wednesday, bringing its total to 10. Most of the dead were residents of a nursing home in Kirkland, a suburb east of Seattle.The House easily passed an $8.3 billion measure to battle the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. The sweeping bipartisan vote came just nine days after President Donald Trump requested action.The legislation more than triples the $2.5 billion plan unveiled by Trump just last week. It would speed development of vaccines and new medicines to battle the virus, pay for containment operations, and beef up preparedness.Trump is expected to sign the measure, which has the blessing of top Republicans.Next up is the GOP-controlled Senate, which hopes to pass the bill Thursday for Trump’s signature.Pet cats and dogs cannot pass the new coronavirus to humans, but they can test positive for low levels of the pathogen if they catch it from their owner.That’s the conclusion of Hong Kong agricultural officials and other experts after a dog in quarantine tested weak positive for the virus in samples from its nose and mouth.The agricultural department said it found no evidence that pets were a source of infection or could get sick themselves with the COVID-19 illness. It suggested, however, that pets from a household of an infected person be quarantined.Nations around the world are girding for months of disruptions from the new virus as it continues its spread outside China.The World Health Organization says there are about 17 times as many new infections outside China as in it, with widening outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran responsible for a majority of the new cases.Countries desperate to keep the crisis from expanding within their borders have further tightened travel restrictions, with Australia, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates among the latest to do so.The Emirates warned its people not to travel anywhere abroad and said those who do could be subject to quarantines when they return.The country’s Health and Community Protection Ministry warning comes as Abu Dhabi sent 215 foreigners it evacuated from hard-hit Hubei in China to a quarantine set up in its Emirates Humanitarian City. They include citizens of Egypt, Sudan and Yemen.Iran has announced new measures to fight a spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus. The new coronavirus has killed 107 people in the Islamic Republic amid 3,513 confirmed cases there.The announcement in Iran came as Palestinian authorities say the Nativity Church in the biblical city of Bethlehem will close indefinitely over coronavirus fears. The church is built atop the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born.Iran’s health minister said Thursday that authorities will start setting set up checkpoints to limit travel between major cities. He’s also urging citizens to reduce their use of paper money and to stay in their vehicles at gas stations.He earlier said authorities will begin manning checkpoints to limit travel between major cities in the Islamic Republic.Authorities in Switzerland say a 74-year-old woman infected with COVID-19 has died, the first death due to the new virus reported in the country.The Federal Office of Public Health said Thursday that the death was reported by authorities in the western canton of Vaud.The woman had been hospitalized since Tuesday and died during the night.As of Wednesday afternoon, 58 infections had been confirmed in Switzerland.Shares in Europe and Asia have advanced, taking their cue from a surge on Wall Street as governments and central banks took more aggressive measures to fight the virus outbreak and its effects on the economy.Benchmarks rose in almost every market on Thursday, though U.S. futures pointed to a weak open.Investors are anticipating more central banks will follow the Federal Reserve’s lead in cutting rates.The gains on Wall Street more than recouped big losses from a day earlier as wild, virus-fueled swings around the world’s markets extend into a third week.Even though lower interest rates will not halt the spread of the virus, investors want to see central banks and other authorities do what they can to lessen the damage.The International Air Transport Association says the virus outbreak that began in China could cost airlines as much as $113 billion in lost revenues due to the collapse of air travel.Representatives of the airline industry group said Thursday after a working meeting in Singapore that the industry urgently needs help from governments in waiving some requirements and fees to alleviate the burden on struggling carriers.An earlier estimate just two weeks ago put the potential cost of the downturn in travel at less than $30 billion.The IATA officials said the consensus of experts was that air travel remains relatively safe and that there are no known cases of passengers spreading the virus while on aircraft.The oil- producing countries of the OPEC cartel are considering whether to slash output to contain a plunge in prices.The cost of crude has fallen 25% since the start of the year amid concerns about the virus outbreak’s disruption to the world economy. Air travel to China all but stopped and demand for transportation fuel inside the country dropped dramatically as cities locked down. Major companies halted business travel.Oil prices stabilized ahead of the meeting on expectations that OPEC and non-OPEC members like Russia would agree to deeper production cuts. Some analysts predict the cartel will agree to slash production by 1 million barrels per day, on top of existing cuts.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Then, there is Sonu Kumar (whose name seems to have been changed, judging by the dub). He becomes the face of religious hatred and majoritarian violence in Gypsy, not too dissimilar to the gunman who fired at protesting JNU students a little over a month ago in Delhi. The imagery of him standing with arms raised, wielding a sword, and having a pregnant Waheeda at his mercy as the merciless assailants around him chant, “ _Maar Dalo_ ” is as chilling and spine-tingling as it is recent.
 What unfolds as a result of the riots, and how it affects Gypsy’s love life forms the rest of the plot.
 It is this latter half of the journey that makes a viewer feel distant about _Gypsy_ , allowing one to only enjoy it in parts and not in its entirety. As a whole, the film struggles to appeal to our collective, to call us out on our bigotry and to remind us of the consequences of keeping our maun vrat in an hour of need. It confronts one political ideology head on, but _Gypsy_ ’s premise as a love story unfolding in the backdrop of a radically right wing fundamentalist political climate needed more juice. It lacks in the department of hard-hitting moments, like a Joker did.
 Perhaps that is what making a film with an established hero entails, although credit where it is due, Jiiva is exceptional as Gypsy. He seems to have put his heart and soul into the character’s representation and portrayal. It ought to be said that the script seldom pushes the actor beyond his comfort zone. It is as if Raju Murugan imagined _Kavalai Vendam_ Jiiva growing out long hair, sporting nomadic clothes and carrying a custom-made guitar around with a horse for company.
 In other words, _Gypsy_ is no _Joker_. There is no single superlative performance (like Guru Somasundaram in the latter). There is no isolated defining moment that strips nude the frivolous nature of the life and times we live in (like the death of a wife for want of a proper toilet). There is no impact after the event.
 Raju Murugan, it would seem so, is less likely to not be crucified at the altar of his National Award-winning sophomore film. _Gypsy_ is no _Joker_ but a gypsy is who we could all aspire to be, if not for the jokers ruining it for us.

ELECTION 2020-SANDERSBernie Sanders to hold post-Super Tuesday rally in PhoenixPHOENIX (AP) — Bernie Sanders will campaign in Phoenix as he looks to recapture the momentum that powered his strong finishes in early states. The Vermont senator's rally at the Arizona state fairgrounds Thursday evening will be his first since a surging Joe Biden grabbed the lead in delegates on Tuesday, turning the race effectively into a two-man contest. Arizona's primary is March 17, but time is of the essence as Sanders looks to shore up support. The overwhelming majority of Arizona voters cast their ballots by mail and are already making up their minds. Biden has no public events scheduled in Arizona aside from a March 15 debate in Phoenix.PHOENIX HOMICIDE CASE-ARRESTPhoenix police arrest suspect in January deathPHOENIX (AP) — Police in Phoenix say they have arrested a man in connection with a January homicide case. They say 20-year-old Jorge Mariscal-Magana was identified as a suspect and taken into custody Tuesday. He’s being held on suspicion of murder, but police haven’t disclosed how Mariscal-Magana was linked to the fatal shooting. It was unclear Wednesday if Mariscal-Magana has a lawyer yet who can speak about the case. Police say 23-year-old Andrew Dereck Santos was found shot in front of a residence on the night of Jan. 17. Santos was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police say a man was seen running away before officers arrived.HIGHWAY PROJECT-NOGALESArizona launching project to improve Nogales truck routePHOENIX (AP) — Arizona is launching a highway improvement project to speed the flow of truck traffic that crosses the U.S. border at Nogales.

Federal, state and local officials participated in a ceremonial groundbreaking Wednesday, and the Arizona state Department of Transportation says construction should start in April. The department says the upgrades to SR 189 will eliminate the current need for trucks to stop up to three times between I-19 and the border.ELECTION 2020-SENATE-ARIZONA-MCSALLYArizona's McSally releases drug pricing legislationPHOENIX (AP) — Arizona Republican Sen.

McSally's bill opens the door to allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices for some drugs, which Republicans have long resisted. But Democrats say it falls far short of delivering the sort of drug price relief that Americans need. McSally said her bill is based on “the art of the possible" and seeks to advance ideas she believes can garner enough support to pass.AP- US-IMMIGRATION-REMAIN-IN-MEXICOCourt blocks 'Remain in Mexico' policy on part of US borderSAN DIEGO (AP) — A federal appeals court says it will halt a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings next week unless the U.S. Supreme Court steps in sooner. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals says its order issued Wednesday would take effect only along the border with Arizona and California. It declined to block the “Remain in Mexico” policy in New Mexico and Texas. The Trump administration says it's asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene.

Authorities say the boy and his 7-year-old brother were severely malnourished and kept in a closet for almost 16 hours a day with little food. Police cited the parents in saying the boys would be disciplined for sneaking out of the closet and taking food while the parents slept. None have been appointed attorneys yet.

As soon as he wrote it, Zervas had a sense that “Roxanne” — which he wanted to strike an upbeat tone at a moment when hip-hop is heavy on gloom — would connect with listeners. “I knew it was an actionable song that people could dance to,” he said — one indication of a businessman’s instinct he said he inherited from his dad, who ran a diner and was “always hustling.”
 Indeed, as the song blew up — and eventually sparked the label frenzy that he said fulfilled all the classic record-biz clichés — Zervas dialed back his presence online, determined to “let the song speak for itself,” he said. He posted only occasionally; he expressed zero interest in rolling out new versions of “Roxanne” à la “Old Town Road.” (He did allow one remix, featuring Swae Lee of Rae Sremmurd, which came out last month.) Zervas said he’d only agreed to this interview because “if I don’t tell people what I’m about then they’ll kind of make up their own story about me” — including, one presumes, the detailed conspiracy theories floating around YouTube that depict Zervas as an industry creation.
 What’s he spent Columbia’s money on? “I bought, like, a new microphone, bro,” he said, adding that fancy cars don’t do much for him. He’s also paid some of his mom’s bills.
 Looking to the future, he’s excited to release more singles — “soon,” he said, declining to elaborate — that show off what else he can do; an old-fashioned album, he added, doesn’t feel especially important in light of the interest he managed to drum up with just one song. But he also wants to develop his live act, and to enjoy the spoils of his success so far. Last month he played his first L.A. concert at the Echo: a rowdy, sold-out affair in which a crowd of several hundred kids cheered as a friend of Zervas’ bounded onstage and downed a beer in seconds flat.

There is precedent for that. When the government offered its first concession on class size from 28 to 25, it didn't mention that a part of that would involve lifting locally administered class size caps.

Many court cases have looked at whether particular processes to consult Indigenous communities have been proper. Killoran said the courts have not reached consistent conclusions.
 The process generally begins with the company seeking to build something, but courts have made clear that the government, not the third party, needs to fulfil the duty to consult.
 The Trans Mountain expansion project will build a second, bigger oil pipeline roughly parallel to an existing one between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C.
 In Trans Mountain's case, its previous builder Kinder Morgan Canada recorded 24,000 engagements with Indigenous communities in 2012 and 2013, before it officially applied to the National Energy Board to proceed with the expansion. The National Energy Board then undertook its hearing process, engaging with 131 Indigenous communities and organizations. Some of the conditions the NEB placed on the pipeline responded to Indigenous concerns.
 Then in early 2016, a few months after the Liberals came to power, the government announced it was extending the consultation with Indigenous communities several months to make sure things were done properly. It would ultimately base its consultation on what the Federal Court of Appeal said the government did wrong when it approved a different pipeline, the Northern Gateway pipeline. The courts killed that project in June 2016.
 When the federal cabinet approved the Trans Mountain project for the first time in November 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had done what was necessary. The government was so confident that in the spring of 2018 it bought the existing pipeline when Kinder Morgan Canada decided to walk away from it amid political turmoil.
 But that confidence was misplaced: the Federal Court of Appeal said in August 2018 that the government sent in "note-takers" to hear Indigenous concerns without any real plan to do anything about them.
 The government then set out to do another round of consultations, hiring former Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci to oversee them in an attempt, once and for all, to get it right.
 The communities that objected the first time still felt they hadn't been listened to, and that the government's process was a rubber-stamping exercise to appease the court. Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal disagreed, ruling the government had fulfilled its obligation.
 The decision also said that while not all the concerns raised by the communities had been accommodated, requiring that would give the communities a "de facto veto" over the project and the law doesn't require that.
 Killoran said the industry sees that decision as clear and hopeful. Callison said without consent, there will be more conflict.
 "You need to have support from Indigenous people," she said. "If you're going to push ahead and rely on a consultative process or a consultative checklist that doesn't result in Indigenous people's consent it doesn't really matter what that process looks like."
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 5, 2020.

(AP) - The U.S. death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 11 with a victim succumbing in California - the first reported fatality outside Washington state.Officials in Placer County, northwest of Sacramento, said Wednesday an elderly adult who tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from a San Francisco-to-Mexico cruise had died. They said the victim had underlying health conditions.Washington also announced another death Wednesday, bringing its total to 10. Most of the dead were residents of a nursing home in Kirkland, a suburb east of Seattle.The House easily passed an $8.3 billion measure to battle the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. The sweeping bipartisan vote came just nine days after President Donald Trump requested action.The legislation more than triples the $2.5 billion plan unveiled by Trump just last week. It would speed development of vaccines and new medicines to battle the virus, pay for containment operations, and beef up preparedness.Trump is expected to sign the measure, which has the blessing of top Republicans.Next up is the GOP-controlled Senate, which hopes to pass the bill Thursday for Trump’s signature.A rising number of churches across the United States are making changes in response to the coronavirus outbreak. For example, many Catholic dioceses are suspending the serving of wine during Communion. One of the bishops ordering this change is Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle, whose region is the worst hit in the U.S. There’s been no indication thus far of any widespread cancellations of worship services. However, experts say it would be wise for faith leaders to start preparing for that possibility — perhaps by planning to livestream their services on social media.Pet cats and dogs cannot pass the new coronavirus to humans, but they can test positive for low levels of the pathogen if they catch it from their owner.That’s the conclusion of Hong Kong agricultural officials and other experts after a dog in quarantine tested weak positive for the virus in samples from its nose and mouth.The agricultural department said it found no evidence that pets were a source of infection or could get sick themselves with the COVID-19 illness. It suggested, however, that pets from a household of an infected person be quarantined.Nations around the world are girding for months of disruptions from the new virus as it continues its spread outside China.The World Health Organization says there are about 17 times as many new infections outside China as in it, with widening outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran responsible for a majority of the new cases.Countries desperate to keep the crisis from expanding within their borders have further tightened travel restrictions, with Australia, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates among the latest to do so.The Emirates warned its people not to travel anywhere abroad and said those who do could be subject to quarantines when they return.The country’s Health and Community Protection Ministry warning comes as Abu Dhabi sent 215 foreigners it evacuated from hard-hit Hubei in China to a quarantine set up in its Emirates Humanitarian City. They include citizens of Egypt, Sudan and Yemen.Iran has announced new measures to fight a spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus. The new coronavirus has killed 107 people in the Islamic Republic amid 3,513 confirmed cases there.The announcement in Iran came as Palestinian authorities say the Nativity Church in the biblical city of Bethlehem will close indefinitely over coronavirus fears. The church is built atop the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born.Iran’s health minister said Thursday that authorities will start setting set up checkpoints to limit travel between major cities. He’s also urging citizens to reduce their use of paper money and to stay in their vehicles at gas stations.He earlier said authorities will begin manning checkpoints to limit travel between major cities in the Islamic Republic.Authorities in Switzerland say a 74-year-old woman infected with COVID-19 has died, the first death due to the new virus reported in the country.The Federal Office of Public Health said Thursday that the death was reported by authorities in the western canton of Vaud.The woman had been hospitalized since Tuesday and died during the night.As of Wednesday afternoon, 58 infections had been confirmed in Switzerland.Shares in Europe and Asia have advanced, taking their cue from a surge on Wall Street as governments and central banks took more aggressive measures to fight the virus outbreak and its effects on the economy.Benchmarks rose in almost every market on Thursday, though U.S. futures pointed to a weak open.Investors are anticipating more central banks will follow the Federal Reserve’s lead in cutting rates.The gains on Wall Street more than recouped big losses from a day earlier as wild, virus-fueled swings around the world’s markets extend into a third week.Even though lower interest rates will not halt the spread of the virus, investors want to see central banks and other authorities do what they can to lessen the damage.The International Air Transport Association says the virus outbreak that began in China could cost airlines as much as $113 billion in lost revenues due to the collapse of air travel.Representatives of the airline industry group said Thursday after a working meeting in Singapore that the industry urgently needs help from governments in waiving some requirements and fees to alleviate the burden on struggling carriers.An earlier estimate just two weeks ago put the potential cost of the downturn in travel at less than $30 billion.The IATA officials said the consensus of experts was that air travel remains relatively safe and that there are no known cases of passengers spreading the virus while on aircraft.The oil-producing countries of the OPEC cartel are considering whether to slash output to contain a plunge in prices.The cost of crude has fallen 25% since the start of the year amid concerns about the virus outbreak’s disruption to the world economy. Air travel to China all but stopped and demand for transportation fuel inside the country dropped dramatically as cities locked down. Major companies halted business travel.Oil prices stabilized ahead of the meeting on expectations that OPEC and non-OPEC members like Russia would agree to deeper production cuts. Some analysts predict the cartel will agree to slash production by 1 million barrels per day, on top of existing cuts.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
