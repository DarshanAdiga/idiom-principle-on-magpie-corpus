Last year, the 5-foot-10, 185-pound junior running back rushed for 108 yards on 23 carries with five touchdowns. Friday night in a 20-18 overtime decision over Cornell, he totaled 147 yards on 20 carries with a 2-point conversion. The OT TD and the conversion run provided the winning margin.
 “He can play multiple positions, even quarterback,” Robinson said. “He’s a talented guy. We want to make sure he’s a master of a trade and not a jack of all trades.

To say this is a questionable decision from the Governor is an understatement to say the least. Many areas are seeing a spike in COVID cases, the White House (including the President himself) have had a huge outbreak in the past week, and America is far from out of the woods on handling the COVID crisis. Not to mention the Dolphins had to stop the sale of popcorn previous to this week's game vs Seattle as fans were using the food item as a way around the Hard Rock Stadium mask policy. The Dolphins also have had issues selling the 13,000 tickets they have set for their first two home games. Week 2 vs Buffalo only 11,000 or so fans were in attendance and about 1/3 were Bills fans. This past week only 12,369 fans were announced as in attendance.

Americans have fought and died for the right to vote. The alarming developments in this extraordinary election year make clear the fight to exercise that right is far from over, particularly for voters of color.
 The disruptive “poll watchers” the Trump campaign dispatched to the city’s early voting locations and the so-called “election integrity” panel Harrisburg Republicans are concocting suggest that partisan attempts to intimidate voters and interfere in the election process are more brazen than at any time in living memory. President Trump, who is trailing Democratic nominee Joe Biden in most polls, including those in Pennsylvania, is laying the groundwork to de-legitimize ballot counts nationwide — and has hinted he might not readily concede to losing, either.
 Months before preliminary voting began in September, Trump was seeding doubts and sowing fears about the Nov. 3 election. He proclaimed without evidence last May that the only way he could possibly lose his bid for a second term would be if the voting were “rigged”; made fake claims about the capabilities of the United States Postal Service; and falsely asserted that voting by mail is vulnerable to wholesale fraud — which it is not.

 LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday there was a 66% chance of a Brexit trade deal but sought to use Prime Minister Boris Johnson's deadline of Oct. 15 to hurry the bloc's negotiators towards an agreement.
 The two sides say they are inching towards a deal that would govern around $900 billion in trade after Dec. 31 - when the current transitional arrangements end - though sticking points remain on fishing, level playing field issues and governance.
 "The landing zone and the nature of the agreement is pretty clear if not exactly pinned down yet," David Frost, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, told parliament. "A deal is eminently achievable and could be achieved but equally it is possible that we won't get there."
 When Johnson's Brexit supremo, Michael Gove, was asked by a Conservative lawmaker if the probability of a deal was still 66%, Gove said: "I think that's about right."
 Frost cautioned the EU that an Oct. 15 deadline set by Johnson on Sept. 7 remained a deadline. The EU is due to asses progress on a deal at an Oct. 15-16 summit.
 He added that Britain's "door would never be closed" and that a huge amount of textual work would need to follow Oct. 15 if an outline deal was struck.
 "As we approach the 15th -- and it is very close already -- I will have to advise the prime minister on whether the conditions in his statement have been met or not, and we will have to consider the situation at that point," Frost said.
 Sterling fell on a Bloomberg report that Britain would pull out of talks next week unless there was clear landing zone for a deal. Sources told Reuters the EU is gearing up to keep negotiating until as late as mid-November.
 The United Kingdom formally left the EU on Jan. 31, more than three years after it voted 52%-48% for Brexit in a 2016 referendum. The two sides are now trying to work out how everything from cars to Camembert to whisky will trade.
 Johnson told European Council President Charles Michel on Wednesday that some progress had been made but that significant differences remained.
 "NOT AT ANY PRICE"
 Gove said no-deal preparations were intensifying so that if the EU was intransigent and no good deal was available, the United Kingdom would not be held hostage by the EU.
 "Those preparations are intensifying as we speak," Gove said. "While we are obviously keen to get a deal, we will not do a deal at any price."
 The EU replied to Gove within hours.
 "The EU prefers a deal, but not at any cost," said Michel. "Time for the UK to put its cards on the table."
 While many investment banks say their base case is that a deal will be done, some diplomats fear Johnson could ultimately decide that a no-deal is more attractive in domestic political terms than such a thin trade deal.
 The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday on the negotiations.
 "Barnier did not strike a particularly optimistic tone today," said one diplomat who attended the briefing, adding that expectations for the Brexit- focused EU summit next week were low and negotiations were expected to continue after that.
 Emotive issues remain unresolved, such as fishing.
 A French EU lawmaker who chairs the European Parliament's fisheries committee told Reuters there could be no annual quota negotiation in a trade deal with Britain, sticking to a tough line from Paris that could make a Brexit deal more difficult.
 Britain could agree to a "glide path" towards a suitable end point for a future fisheries agreement with the EU as long as it satisfied the country's fishing communities, Frost said.

These resources could help reduce the potential for significant errors, delays, and even the exceedingly rare attempts to game the voting system. Local election boards in Pennsylvania and New Jersey need to add staff, secure additional technology, and train additional volunteers to handle the challenges of accommodating in-person, and mail-in, balloting. We have confidence that the technical glitches that confounded early voters at election stations in Philly neighborhoods last week will be corrected. And the discovery that several memory sticks for programming voting machines were stolen from a warehouse in East Falls must be vigorously investigated.
 Like the memory-stick theft, questionable mail-in ballots, such as those found after a municipal election in Paterson, N.J., earlier this year, often are identified and investigated. The improper disposal of seven mail-in ballots for Trump in Republican-controlled Luzerne County — an incident Trump seized upon during the debate — came to the attention of election officials.
 Due to the pandemic, confusion would likely have arisen this year even without the president’s falsehoods. It’s also worth noting that worries surrounding elections have long been mostly about low voter turnout and lack of civic engagement. The turmoil of this election has served to motivate voters, with a record turnout predicted.
 Every registered New Jersey voter can expect to receive a mail-in ballot. Pennsylvania voters who wish to use that option must request a mail-in ballot from their county election office before the Oct. 27 deadline. Information is available through those offices or online at VotePa.gov, nj.gov/state/elections, or The Inquirer's election guide.
 It’s incumbent on voters to educate themselves, and for those choosing to vote by mail to do so well in advance of Nov. 3. And it’s the responsibility of local election boards and poll workers to make sure that voters are well served and ballots are properly counted. Pandemic and politics notwithstanding, we are confident this American tradition will be upheld.
