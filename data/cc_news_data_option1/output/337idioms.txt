The fires that roared through southeastern Australia for months razed hundreds of houses and killed more than 20 people, including several firefighters. A scar the size of Portugal now marks the land, a varying mix of tropical forest, eucalyptus and red-earth plains.
 The largest in the nation’s history, the fires have come to be seen as a sign that Australia’s climate, despite words to the contrary from Prime Minister Scott Morrison, is warming up and drying out at a much faster rate than predicted even a few years ago.
 There is no argument from the beloved fauna of this vast wild country. On Kangaroo Island, its sand and brush-covered bluffs visible just a few miles offshore from Adelaide, the fires burned without mercy, guided only by the stiff wind.
 Georgie Dolphin, the program manager for animal welfare at Humane Society International, estimated that at least half the koala habitat was destroyed, killing the vast majority of the animals as the fire crackled though it.
 Before the fire, an estimated 50,000 koalas lived on the island. Today, there are fewer than half that.
 “And we really don’t have a full count,” said Adam Parascandola, a Washington, D.C., native and animal handler with the society for the past decade. “It could be much worse.”
 Dolphin, Parascandola and a third member of their team, Patrick Brothers, were exploring a wedge of burned eucalyptus forest just on the outer edge of Flinders Chase, a grove still off-limits earlier last week because of the fire’s aftermath.
 There were clues to track a troubled koala.
 Among the dozens of dead kangaroos scattered across the burned-clean forest floor, small brown mounds appeared here and there. These were makeshift watering holes, seldom used by koalas. But without leaves in the trees, the surviving marsupials came down for the occasional moisture.
 “When you see them on the ground, that is not normal behavior,” Dolphin said. “They look sad, defeated, but we’re happy with every one we save.”
 Brothers and Parascandola managed to ease one koala away from a hole, encase him between two plastic laundry baskets and pad out his brief holding cell with towels. Docile and curious, the juvenile bear had burns on his nose and on the backs of his legs.
 “These are wild animals that have never seen humans, and it makes them very stressed and sometimes difficult,” Parascandola said. “But if we do not take them out of here, they will simply starve to death.”
 This one would get a stay at the local recovery center on the island, among the fortunate. A day earlier, the team found an adult kangaroo lying on its side, unmoving but alive. The team called for a veterinarian. The burns on the legs and bottoms of the kangaroo’s feet were too severe to heal, and on his side still, he was euthanized.
 It is unclear here whether the eucalyptus forests will recover, almost certainly not to the same near-ubiquitous pre-fire extent. The island is lovely, just now so very full of death.
 For the koalas, the recovery will be slow.
 In recent years, there have been debates in Australia over whether to cull a koala population that has perhaps outgrown its habitat. Those plans never made it past public opinion, but for two years, hundreds of koalas have been put on a sterilization program.
 Dolphin said the population will return more slowly as a result, and it is very hard to see the small, stricken bodies on the forest floor and know just how long it may be until the trees are full again. Not even the birds have returned.

WASHINGTON -- A blueprint the White House is rolling out to resolve the decades-long conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is as much about politics as it is about peace.
   
 President Donald Trump said he would likely release his long-awaited Mideast peace plan a little before separate meetings this coming week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main political rival Benny Gantz. The Washington get-togethers offer political bonuses for Trump and the prime minister, but Trump's opponents are doubting the viability of any plan since there's been little-to-no input from the Palestinians, who have rejected it before its release.
   
 "It's entirely about politics," Michael Koplow, policy director of the Israel Policy Forum, said about Tuesday's meeting. "You simply can't have a serious discussion about an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan and only invite one side to come talk about it. This is more about the politics inside Israel and inside the U.S. than it is about any real efforts to get these two sides to an agreement."
   
 Jared Kushner, a Trump adviser and the president's son-in-law, has been the architect for the plan for nearly three years. He's tried to persuade academics, lawmakers, former Mideast negotiators, Arab governments and special interest groups not to reject his fresh approach outright.
   
 People familiar with the administration's thinking believe the release will have benefits even if it never gets Palestinian buy-in and ultimately fails. According to these people, the peace team believes that if Israeli officials are open to the plan and Arab nations do not outright reject it, the proposal could help improve broader Israeli-Arab relations.
   
 For years, the prospect of improved ties between Israel and its Arab neighbors had been conditioned on a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the administration believes that a change in regional dynamics - due mainly to rising antipathy to Iran - will boost Israel's standing with not only Egypt and Jordan, which already have peace deals with the Jewish state, but also Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf nations, these people say.
   
 There have been signs of warming between Israel and the Gulf states, including both public displays and secret contacts, and the administration sees an opening for even greater cooperation after the plan is released, according to these people.
   
 Trump, for his part, told reporters on Air Force One this week that "It's a plan that really would work." He said he spoke to the Palestinians "briefly," without elaborating.
   
 Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for the Western-backed Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, says that's not true.
   
 "There were no talks with the U.S. administration -- neither briefly nor in detail," he said. "The Palestinian position is clear and consistent in its rejection of Trump's decisions regarding Jerusalem and other issues, and everything related to the rejected deal."
   
 Abbas ended contacts with the administration after it recognized disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital two years ago. The Palestinians' anger mounted as Trump repeatedly broken with the international consensus around solving the conflict and took actions seen as biased toward Israel's right-wing government.
   
 The White House has cut off nearly all U.S. aid to the Palestinians and closed the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington. In November, the Trump administration said it no longer views Jewish settlements in the occupied territories as a violation of international law, reversing four decades of American policy. The Palestinians view the settlements as illegal and a major obstacle to peace, a position shared by most of the international community.
   
 Tuesday's meeting offers benefits to both leaders while they are under fire at home.
   
 The meeting allows Trump to address a high-profile foreign policy issue during his impeachment trial, while Democrats are arguing for his ouster. Moreover, if the plan is pro-Israel as expected, Trump hopes it will be popular with his large base of evangelicals and maybe sway a few anti-Trump Jewish voters his way.
   
 According to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of the American electorate, 79% of white evangelical voters in the 2018 midterms approved of the job Trump was doing as president, while 74% of Jewish voters disapproved.
   
 Pastor John Hagee, founder and chairman of the 8 million-member Christians United for Israel, said in a statement that Trump "has shown himself to be the most pro-Israel president in U.S. history, and I fully expect his peace proposal will be in line with that tradition."
   
 For Netanyahu, the meeting allows him to shift press coverage Tuesday when Israel's parliament convenes a committee that is expected to reject his request for legal immunity from charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes.
   
 "The 'Trump peace plan' is a blatant attempt to hijack Israel's March 2 election in Netanyahu's favor," tweeted Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist for Israel's Haaretz newspaper and the author of a biography of Netanyahu.
   
 Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival ahead of the election. The decision to bring Gantz along is likely aimed at forestalling any criticism that the U.S. administration is meddling in the election. But in Israel, the meeting and the unveiling of the plan will be widely seen as a gift to the prime minister. Netanyahu has noted that it was his idea to invite Gantz.
   
 But Gantz said Saturday that he plans to meet privately with Trump on Monday and then return to Israel immediately to lead the parliamentary hearing seeking to reject Netanyahu's plea for immunity.
   
 In Congress, Trump's announced release of his Mideast plan has caused hardly a ripple against the backdrop of the impeachment drama.
   
 Asked on Friday what he thought about the expected rollout, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said: "I'm on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and we've not heard anything about it."
   
 Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, the committee chairman, defended the administration's work on a plan.
   
 "I think the people who are working on this are working on this in good faith," Risch said in the halls of Congress, shortly before Trump's impeachment trial resumed. "I think the people who are trying to do it really are acting in good faith, hoping they can come up with a solution."
   
 Associated Press writers Matthew Lee in Washington and Joseph Krauss, Josef Federman and Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.
