CONCORD — The Pierce Brigade, the membership organization dedicated to preserving the home and legacy of President Franklin Pierce, has adopted Old North Cemetery on North State Street as part of Wreaths Across America. Wreaths will be laid on the graves of 200 veterans in the historic cemetery.
 On Saturday, Dec. 19 at 10 a.m., the public is invited to join representatives from each of the seven military service branches as they place a commemorative wreath at the entrance to the cemetery. The wreath will remain in place until spring. A color guard made up of members of the 6th New Hampshire Volunteer Historical Association will attend the ceremony. The event is rain or shine, and attendees are required to wear face masks and practice social distancing.
 Old North Cemetery is the final resting place of those who served in such conflicts as the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War and the Spanish American War. Old North Cemetery is also where Franklin Pierce, the 14th president of the United States and a brigadier general in the Mexican War, is buried.
 Wreaths Across America was founded in 2007 as a way to expand the annual wreath laying ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery and support groups across the country wishing to pay tribute to the veterans who served their state and our nation. The Concord ceremony is being held the same day that wreaths will be laid in Arlington National Cemetery.
 Volunteers wishing to assist in the placement of wreaths on veterans’ graves are invited to join the Pierce Brigade on Friday, Dec. 18, at 10 a.m. at Old North Cemetery, 141 North State St.

With Jake LaTurner heading off to Washington, D.C., soon, Gov. Laura Kelly will be appointing a new Kansas state treasurer. No doubt she has a list in her office right now of fine, capable, upstanding people who have years of public service and money-management credentials on their resumes.
   
 The governor might want to throw that list out and create a new one, because the person for the job should be a promoter first and foremost.
   
 From the job title, you would think that the state treasurer is a financial mastermind, investing and manipulating the billions of dollars running through the state. Not exactly. The state treasurer sits on two committees -- the KPERS Board of Trustees (one of nine members) and the Kansas Pooled Money Investment Board (one of five members) -- that oversee the investment of state retirement and general fund monies.
   
 The treasurer has a vote at these meetings, and then has time on his or her hands to do other things.
   
 One of the things treasurers like to do is run for higher office. Since 1972, every single elected Kansas treasurer has gone on to run for another office. Joan Finney became governor, and the past three treasurers -- LaTurner, Ron Estes and Lynn Jenkins -- won election to the U.S. Congress. Tom Van Sickle, Tim Shallenburger and LaTurner didn't even get through one term before dreaming of bigger things. LaTurner announced he was running for U.S. Senate a scant two months after being elected to his first term as treasurer.
   
 But that's OK, because the modern job of treasurer now demands a promoter rather than a money manager.
   
 The treasurer can hire good people to do the money stuff, but as one of six officials elected statewide, only the treasurer can command the media spotlight needed to successfully promote several key programs administered by the office. These are the state's program for unclaimed property and money, the Kansas 529 college savings program, and the treasurer's high school scholarship program.
   
 LaTurner understood the promotional role of the treasurer. He excelled at it and took it to a new level by featuring himself and his family in his office's 529 promotional TV ads. Let me humbly state that I was wrong to be critical of those ads when they first appeared.
   
 I didn't understand then what I've come to see now, which is that the new role of the state treasurer requires a person who is not only willing to use the spotlight to promote the state's programs but is also highly talented in doing so. To give you an example of my point, how many of you remember Ron Estes' or Dennis Mckinney's 529 TV ads? Total snoozeville.
   
 LaTurner is the exception. Somewhat surprisingly, most politicians are not impressive promoters nor particularly good on TV, so Gov. Kelly should think outside the box when making her choice.
   
 Look at people from the media business, like television newscasters and presenters, people who know how to connect through television and the modern mediums of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
   
 Look for someone who might raise a few eyebrows at first, but when their first 529 or unclaimed property TV ads start airing, will make us all see that the governor did in fact pick someone well qualified for the modern job of Kansas treasurer.

As COVID-19 continues its march through state correctional facilities, inmates are feeling the effects of the pandemic even before they actually make it into prison.
   
 At several correctional facilities across the state, "intake isolation units" have been set up for incoming inmates to quarantine before actually entering the main facility.
   
 But Mari Flowers, whose daughter is being housed at the intake unit at Topeka Correctional Facility, said the atmosphere was described to her as "inhumane."
   
 Inmates are only to be in the unit, housed inside an unused portion of the prison grounds, for 21 days to quarantine. At that point they are then moved inside the prison.
   
 But Flowers said the entire cohort must test negative before the inmates can be moved. Anytime an inmate is infected, the 21-day clock resets.
   
 "She has been tested eight times, they've all been negative," Flowers said. " ... But every time they test her group, someone turns up positive and her quarantine starts all over. There is just a lot of frustration in that building."
   
 An example of that frustration, her daughter reported, was when another inmate who tested positive punched a corrections officer who came to move her.
   
 And Flowers said the tent is moldy, with one bathroom for the 38 women and cold temperatures each morning, while the mandate to be socially distant is all but impossible.
   
 "It is almost like they want her to get COVID," she said.
   
 While the Kansas Department of Corrections has defended its COVID-19 mitigation strategies, inmates, family members and activists argue they aren't being followed consistently and are in a constant state of flux.
   
 KDOC spokesperson Carol Pitts said the agency is working "ensure all mitigation efforts are consistent with current public health practices."
   
 Activists hope for change at El Dorado
   
 The virus isn't a new problem for the state's prisons and jails. Since the pandemic began, almost 6,000 inmates and staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus and 11 inmates and three staff members have died.
   
 But as case counts have increased among the general public in recent weeks, another spike in cases at KDOC facilities and county jails has followed.
   
 The frustration boiled over at El Dorado Correctional Facility last week, which has over a third of the 324 active COVID-19 cases in correctional facilities.
   
 One of the inmates, Brian Betts, said a hunger strike was launched in protest of the conditions, although KDOC said last week it didn't officially designate the event as such.
   
 Brandilyn Parks, founder of the Kansas Coalition for Sentence and Prison Reform, also confirmed the hunger strike.
   
 The root, she said, was linked to arbitrary schedule changes and the fact that inmates positive for the coronavirus are being returned to the prison population after a quarantine period that varies and may not ensure that an inmate is no longer infectious.
   
 Lisa Patterson said her loved one housed in El Dorado tested negative consistently but one day was moved without explanation to a cell block of inmates positive for the coronavirus.
   
 He since has been returned to the general population, puzzled as to what happened but forced to assume he tested positive.
   
 The outbreak, she said, caught the prison off guard.
   
 "They didn't have a plan and they already knew what happened at Lansing," Patterson said.
   
 Inmates are also strictly limited in their time out of cell, something KDOC insists isn't new and is a part of efforts to stop the virus's spread.
   
 But Patterson said cells are passed over arbitrarily for the scant 15 minutes a day where inmates are allowed out of their cell, which is used for crucial activities, such as showering or accessing email.
   
 It got to the point, she said, where inmates were forced to attempt to wash up in their cell bathroom, using a bed sheet to ensure a modicum of privacy.
   
 "Can you imagine being locked in a room the size of a bedroom with two beds in there for almost 24 hours a day, for eight weeks, with the same person?" she said. "They don't come out of that."
   
 Change appears to be afoot, however.
   
 Parks said that COVID-19 negative inmates in El Dorado were in the process of being moved to Ellsworth and Lansing correctional facilities
   
 While it is unclear whether the inmates will eventually be returning to El Dorado, Parks said it could be an improvement if mitigation practices were more strictly followed at the other facilities and if inmates had more certainty in terms of out-of-cell time.
   
 "We are not sure until we get more information," she said.
   
 Lack of information frustrates loved ones
   
 Family members and loved ones still cite an inability to receive updates from prison authorities.
   
 Patterson, for example, said she always gets a busy signal when calling El Dorado, even though she tries on a near-daily basis.
   
 When she called the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, a representative suggested that she instead talk to the media.
   
 And Flowers said her efforts to reach someone at the prison were only rewarded earlier this week, when a warden called to inform her that the procedures were following KDHE guidance.
   
 "She said they're so overcrowded that they just don't have anywhere to put these women," Flowers said she was told.
   
 Virus affects sex offender program
   
 COVID-19 has also made its way into a treatment program for former sex offenders that is housed at Larned State Hospital.
   
 The Sexual Predator Treatment Program is programming aimed at those who have completed their prison sentence but are considered likely to commit another violent sexual offense.
   
 Relatively few detainees complete the program, in which residents participate until they are deemed suitable to re-enter society.
   
 But many of the components touted as part of the initiative are shut down because of the pandemic.
   
 George Everhart, a resident in the program, said classes have been canceled and group therapy has been limited to one session per week, lasting roughly 45 minutes.
   
 "This is not the therapy we were sent here for," he said. "In reality it is a waste of time and money."
   
 Cara Sloan-Ramos, a spokesperson for the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, which runs Larned State Hospital, confirmed that cases were rising as community transmission became prevalent in Pawnee County.
   
 An exact number of positive cases could not be provided, she said, because the data was changing rapidly.
   
 But Sloan-Ramos detailed a length list of mitigation efforts, including temperature checks, mandatory mask wearing and a ban on outside visitors.
   
 Everhart said the mitigation procedures are being followed but still expressed frustration that there is no mechanism for residents to be released.
   
 "They are letting inmates out of prison and they are there for committing a crime," he said. "We have already served our prison time."
   
 Advocates still push for early release
   
 But activists believe there hasn't been enough effort to release inmates from prisons, which have become overcrowded in recent years.
   
 The state has even sent inmates to a private prison in Arizona in an effort to relieve crowding.
   
 The result? Over 70 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus at the facility, which is run by the firm CoreCivic.
   
 KDOC has maintained that the spread among the 118 total inmates being held at Saguaro Correctional Center is similar to what has been seen in Kansas prisons.
   
 Still, the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has persisted in its effort to secure clemency for a group of inmates who are largely older, have underlying health conditions or were convicted of nonviolent offenses.
   
 An early release program began in the spring but was soon halted due to the virus's spread through the prisons, most notably a major outbreak at Lansing Correctional Facility.
   
 Kelly has said she would consider restarting the program, however.
   
 "The issue of releasing folks from prison is an ongoing one," Kelly said in May. "I expect that it will be sort of a rolling measure, now that we've got the system in place to verify who's eligible for that."
   
 There are roughly 30 applications for clemency from the ACLU currently sitting on her desk, and a spokesperson for Kelly said they will be reviewed "after she receives a full process of developing facts and with input from those affected."
   
 "More importantly, our state has a structural criminal justice problem that needs to be addressed," Kelly's spokesperson said. "The governor is ready to work with the Legislature to revise our approach to incarceration so that we can be smarter about who we send to prison and for how long."
   
 The fear, Patterson said, is that the situation in prisons is going to be out of sight and out of mind for the public.
   
 But none of the inmates, she said, should be confined to a death sentence, regardless of any past offenses.
   
 "A lot of people don't care because 'Well, they're in prison for something, they deserve whatever they get,' " Patterson said. "But some people in there are wrongly convicted or were convicted of something minor. They don't deserve a death sentence."

Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski swore he was not making excuses Tuesday night after his team had suffered its second nonconference loss at home, the first time that’s happened in one season since 1982-83.
 But he nonetheless raised the question after the Blue Devils’ 15-point loss to Illinois: whether college basketball teams should be playing amid a national coronavirus spike that is causing games to be canceled and teams to scramble on a daily basis.
 “I don’t think it feels right to anybody,” Krzyzewski, major college basketball’s all-time leader in career victories, told reporters. “I’m not sure who leads college basketball, you know. It’s done by committee. You have (an) oversight committee, you have this committee, and anything that’s led by committee is not agile in handling a situation. And so we made an assessment, and there was a consensus. It wasn’t, like, well planned that we’re going to start November 25 ...
 “Basically, it was more of a mentality of, ‘Get as many games in as possible.’ And I think I would just like, just for the safety, the mental health and the physical health of our players and staff ... like, to assess where we’re at.”
 In mid-September, about six months after the cancellation of the 2020 men’s and women’s NCAA basketball tournaments, the NCAA announced that this year’s college basketball season would begin Nov. 25 with teams allowed to play 27 games, at most. A handful of Division I programs — the eight-member Ivy League, Bethune-Cookman and Maryland-Eastern Shore — opted to cancel their men’s and women’s seasons.
 But dozens of teams that have played on — including top-ranked Gonzaga; No. 7 Houston; 12th-ranked Tennessee, which didn’t play its first game until Tuesday night; and No. 18 Virginia, the most recent NCAA men’s champion — have had to pause their seasons because of positive coronavirus tests. Hundreds of games have been postponed or canceled, some of them within hours of tip-off after teams already were on site.
 During Tuesday night’s Duke-Illinois telecast, ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said the country was in much better shape with the pandemic when the NCAA decided a few months ago to move forward with its basketball seasons. But with coronavirus numbers spiking across the nation, Bilas said it might be time to consider whether the season should be paused until the virus is better under control.
 “The question I have is, if we were deciding to start now, would we start now?” Bilas said. “The answer, I think, would be no.”
 “I’m sensitive to the fact that the players want to play. I get it,” Bilas continued. “But we also have to acknowledge that the circumstances have changed ... If we were playing outdoors and there were lightning in the area, we wouldn’t canvas the players to decide if they wanted to play. We would say, ‘It’s too dangerous, we’ve gotta pause for now.’ “
 Rick Pitino, the longtime coach who’s in his first year at Iona, has repeatedly called for the NCAA to delay the season until after the new year, saying in mid-November that teams should be restricted to conference-only schedules and that the NCAA tournament should be played in May instead of its usual March.
 When the season started Nov. 25, the Gaels were in the midst of a 14-day, NCAA-mandated shutdown after a person associated with the program tested positive for coronavirus. Iona’s first four games were canceled, and it has seen two more called off since then because of coronavirus issues with opposing teams.
 “What a mess,” Pitino tweeted on Dec. 3 in announcing that the Gaels’ home opener against Merrimack had been canceled. “Hopefully, we’ll someday celebrate our freedom from this virus. Stay safe.”
 The NCAA last month announced that it plans to hold its 2021 men’s basketball tournament in one location, possibly Indianapolis, in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus and to avoid interruption of the wildly popular event, which generates more than 70% of the NCAA’s $1.1 billion in annual revenue.
 In response to a request for comment on whether pausing the season has been considered by the sport’s leadership, the NCAA referred The Washington Post to comments made by President Steve Emmert in an interview Tuesday with the Associated Press.
 “We’ve done a whole array of things, many of which member schools in the past have said, ‘No, no, no, we can’t do that. That’s not right.’ Well, we’re doing it. And the sporting world hasn’t collapsed,” Emmert said of how the governing body has addressed issues stemming from the pandemic, including scheduling. “And so can we as we move forward, say, well, why can’t we continue to do that? Why can’t we continue to provide more flexibility? Why can’t we continue to think more creatively about scheduling models and about the way we run a variety of elements of the associations?”
 Stanford women’s coach Tara VanDerveer is one win away from tying Tennessee’s Pat Summitt for the most in the history of women’s college basketball (1,098), but her next attempt to do so — Friday against UC Davis — was canceled Tuesday. The top-ranked Cardinal has relocated to Las Vegas because of Santa Clara County’s ban on athletic activities that involve physical contact or take place indoors, while the Aggies have paused their program to comply with Yolo County’s new coronavirus regulations.
 “The pandemic, the situation we’re in, it really makes you appreciate each game,” VanDerveer told the AP after her team had ascended to the top spot in the rankings even though three of its games had been canceled or postponed. “Each game is so precious, and we’re so excited to be playing. We’re here in Vegas, we don’t know what our schedule is. We’re working the phones, trying to get games.”
 Teams indeed have been creating new schedules on the fly. Iona’s first game — Nov. 30 against Seton Hall, another team that was amid a coronavirus pause when the season began on Nov. 25 — was scheduled only two days before it was played. No. 2 Baylor, meanwhile, had its first three games of the season canceled after coach Scott Drew tested positive for the coronavirus. But instead of sitting idle, the Bears flew to Las Vegas on Thanksgiving night for two tentative games without even knowing the identities of the opponents (Baylor would score wins over Louisiana and Washington in Las Vegas, with assistant Jerome Tang coaching the team in Drew’s absence).
 Maryland’s last game was last Friday afternoon’s rout of Saint Peter’s, who replaced George Mason on the Terrapins’ scrambled schedule after a positive coronavirus test in the Patriots’ program. Maryland was scheduled to depart for a game the next day at James Madison via bus after Friday’s game, but the game against the Dukes — themselves a replacement opponent for Maryland after a Dec. 1 game against Towson was canceled — was called off about 15 minutes before the Terrapins were scheduled to leave College Park after James Madison reported a positive test within its program.
 Maryland Coach Mark Turgeon was asked if there were any positives to be gleaned from college basketball’s uncertain situation.
 “We were disappointed the game got canceled Saturday. We were packed and getting ready to get on the bus. Just to get away and travel might have been good for everybody’s mojo, but didn’t happen,” Turgeon said. “You adjust your schedule to the lost game and we’ve had a little bit more practice time because of it. We would have had a little bit less. So you’ve got to think of that as a positive. And just kind of go from there. It’s one day at a time. It really is.”

At the 2020 4th quarter meeting of NACCIMA Council in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State recently, it called on government at all levels to fully involve the OPSN and private sector operators in the articulation and subsequent implementation of policies. The council is of the firm view that as the country searches for a way out of economic recession, government must work closely with the private sector, which will have a key role to play, if the goal of early recovery will be met in the first quarter of 2021 as being predicted by the Minister of Finance, the CBN Governor and others in government circles. The council meeting had in attendance members of chambers of commerce from across the country and was presided over by its National President, Hajiya Saratu Iya Aliyu. At the meeting, the council drew attention to the fact that the Q3 contraction of the economy was fore told in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the drop in crude oil prices, and the civil unrest that ensured. All of these issues require robust response in close cooperation with the OPSN. The council also drew attention to the need for proper synergy of monetary and fiscal policies that will engender inclusive growth and development in some strategic sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing and mining. Most importantly, the OPSN must be taken on board in the articulation of policies, policy implementation, and the process of monitoring and evaluation. The council also reaffirmed its position that diversification must be given more serious attention and the Economic Sustainability Plan should be faithfully implemented in a way to ensure quick impact to tackle the issues of unemployment and infrastructural development.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio State football will, officially, play in a fourth consecutive Big Ten championship game.
 The league announced Wednesday that it has eliminated its minimum-game requirement for participation in the Big Ten championship game. Ohio State, which is 5-0 after three cancellations related to the coronavirus pandemic, will play 5-1 Northwestern in the Dec. 19 game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.
 In a news release, the league said the decision was made by the Big Ten Conference Administrators Council — comprised of the athletic directors and senior women administrators from all 14 programs — and in collaboration with the Council of Presidents and Chancellors and the conference office.
 According to the Big Ten, the decision came down to the reality that Ohio State would have advanced to the championship game even if it had played Michigan on Saturday and lost. The Buckeyes own the tiebreaker over one-loss Indiana by virtue of a 42-35 victory on Nov. 21.
 Ohio State is the only league team to experience an COVID-19 case spike that required a cancellation but did not have to cancel two games. The Buckeyes played two games without their head coach, Manchester native Ryan Day, who tested positive for COVID-19.
 Ohio State is also the only Big Ten team to have two games canceled because it was scheduled to play opponents who experienced outbreaks that week. The second came Tuesday, when Michigan determined it could not play The Game on Saturday.
 Ohio State had more at stake than a shot at its fourth consecutive Big Ten championship. The Buckeyes have been No. 4 in each of the first three releases of the College Football Playoff rankings. Conference championships won are not a baseline criteria for the CFP selection committee, but are one of the tiebreakers which they are known to consider.
 Even if Ohio State wins the Big Ten championship game, its CFP resume is not assured in comparison to other contenders. The Buckeyes would be 6-0, while Alabama, Notre Dame, Clemson and others will have played 11 games.
