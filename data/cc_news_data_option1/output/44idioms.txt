Two men and a woman were found dead in a house on Belvin Rd., just off Chestnut Hill Rd., Friday night and authorities believe the trio died from fumes coming from a propane heater that was unvented.
 Cumberland County Sheriff Casey Cox confirmed the deaths and on-going investigation. The bodies were transported to the Tennessee Medical Examiners Office in Nashville for autopsies and to establish positive identities.
 Until that is done and next of kin have been notified, the identity of the trio is being withheld. It is believed all three are Cumberland County residents and at least two of the three were related.
 E-911 Center received a call shortly after 11 p.m. Friday night of the discovery of two bodies in a house, according to Cox. A neighbor had been asked by a family member to go check on the house after being unable to contact family members for a few days.
 When the unidentified neighbor discovered the two bodies, he quickly left the house and notified authorities.
 Responding deputies and Cumberland County Emergency Medical personal raced to the scene.

During the stretch, the Dragons took their first lead of the contest with 2:46 remaining before the break when Apple scored in the paint after receiving an assist from teammate Hailey Morris. The Cavaliers kept the score close, however, behind the play of senior Paris Pettitt, who connected on four 3-pointers in the game, three of which came in the second quarter. Pettitt ended the game with 16 points for Jefferson Forest.
 In addition to the superb all-around performance from Rush, Apple and Weaver each finished with a double-double for the Dragons. Apple had 18 points and 12 rebounds, while Weaver ended the night with 12 points and 10 boards. Morris added seven assists on the evening.

 Paris knife attack called terror related
 PARIS — French prosecutors said a knife attack on Friday that left one man dead and two women injured in a park in the Paris area is being treated as terror-related.
 On Saturday, they said investigations revealed that the assailant, who was shot dead by police, had been radicalized and had prepared the attack in Villejuif, in the Paris suburbs. They said their investigations justify a probe into “murder and attempted murder in relation to a terrorist undertaking.”
 Earlier Saturday, Creteil prosecutor Laure Beccuau described the assailant as a 22-year-old man with a long psychiatric history.
 The two women hurt in the attack have left the hospital.

The heaviest snow up on Mt. Hood came in the overnight hours. Most resorts have so far picked up about 6-10 inches of snow. More of the same is expected tomorrow up on the mountain. We could see another 6-12 inches on Sunday. The mountain snow will continue this week, but snow levels will climb just a bit on Tuesday to above pass level, and then drop again by Wednesday afternoon. Ample opportunities for more inches of snow up on the mountain through the next 7 days.
 Snow on the mountain means rain for us here in Portland. In fact, the next 7 days look wet. Plenty of showers will hit the westside valleys with heavy rain at times. Winds pick up again here on Tuesday, and showers continue into late week. Temperatures will stay in the mid 40s all week long. Some models are indicating a colder turn of weather by next weekend, other then that, the weather pattern stays unsettled with several rounds of rain.

Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz knows that with Russell Wilson on the field, the Seahawks are always just a snap away from a big, game-changing play.
 That said, Schwartz feels his Philly defence knows what to expect from the electrifying Seahawks quarterback.
 "I don't think he'll play out of character -- he's got a long history of how he plays," Schwartz said of one of the more consistent QBs of recent vintage in the NFC. "You look at his stats across the board -- it's really amazing how every year he's just so damn consistent."
 As much as the Eagles would like to attack, Schwartz acknowledges that Wilson is one of the more difficult quarterbacks to force into making a mistake.
 "He's a smart quarterback," Schwartz said. "He's got great mobility and he doesn't turn the ball over very often. He's got great mobility. He can extend plays, but he can also just make his plays from the pocket.
 "All those things will be factors in the game that we're going to have to defend."

WORCESTER -- When people first meet Cindy Purcell they're usually taken aback to learn that even though she's a quadriplegic, she's married -- to another quadriplegic -- she's a mother, she works full-time, she drives a mini-van and she lives a happy, productive life.
 As a senior vocational rehab counselor for the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, she provides an upbeat and uplifting role model for her 135 clients, most of whom have mental-health and substance-abuse issues.
 "I never say I did it, so you can do it," Purcell said from her office in downtown Worcester Friday, "but they see it."
 Christmas cards from grateful clients stand atop her desk and filing cabinet in her office. A card from someone she helped find a job reads in part: "I will always consider you a mentor in my life and also an inspiration to people with disabilities."
 The 61-year-old Rutland resident says she's shocked by the warm reaction she receives from clients she helps find jobs or training for jobs, but Ellen Spencer, area director of the Worcester office of the commission, is not surprised.
 "Some of our toughest characters," Spencer said, "with mental-health issues all over the place or coming right out of jails and horrible backgrounds, she sees the person sitting across the table and helps them have faith in themselves, and sometimes you think, 'We can't give this consumer to a woman because they've been so violent in their past,' and she tames the worst lion to believe in themselves."
 Purcell also advocates for people with disabilities at such other agencies as Center for Living and Working and the MassHire Worcester Career Center, and she belongs to District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr.'s opioid task force and advisory boards for YOU Inc. and the YWCA.
 "The injury that happened in '77 hasn't stopped her from anything," said her 22-year-old son, Tanner. "She does more for herself, her family, her friends than anyone that I know. The injury isn't even a thing because of the way she is, you wouldn't even know that she ever had an injury like that."
 Her positive attitude also goes a long way.
 "Every day is a challenge for her to get here," Spencer said. "She never knows what her body is going to do to her, but she's always smiling, pretty much always."
 Purcell worked for three years at CLW before serving on the board of the agency that works with people with disabilities to live as independently as possible.
 "Cindy is a strong advocate for the consumers we serve," CLW CEO Meg Coffin said. "Cindy is never afraid to speak up and address an issue of inequality, and is an example of what is possible to those we serve. Cindy's positive can- do attitude is infectious, and her sense of humor is contagious. She has used this positive attitude to face and overcome the challenges in her life."
 Purcell suffered a broken neck and severed the nerves of her spinal column when she was an 18-year-old passenger in a car accident on an icy road in Holden on Feb. 13, 1977. When she saw the car approaching a tree, she lowered her head to protect her teeth, which had been straightened by braces, and the top of her head slammed into the dashboard. Her doctor promised her only that she would be able to turn her head from side to side and that she'd be able to shrug her left shoulder. She admitted she wanted to die.
 Thanks to extensive physical therapy, she can move both shoulders and arms. She cannot move her fingers, but with the aid of splints she can feed herself, write and work a computer. She has no feeling below her upper chest, however.
 Personal care attendants get the 5-foot-2-inch, 95-pound Purcell in and out of bed at her house, cook and help her shower and get dressed.
 Purcell admits she cried every day for years after her accident, but she began to regain her upbeat attitude after she learned she could apply her own lipstick, makeup and nail polish. More importantly, she also was told she could still give birth someday. What really turned her life around was reaching out to the MRC for help. The commission helped her to relearn to drive a car and enroll at Mount Wachusett Community College, where she earned an associate degree in human services.
 The commission eventually hired her, and she's been working there for 32 years.
 Purcell's husband of 29 years, Ted, injured himself in a skiing accident at 14 in 1979. Although he's technically a quadriplegic, he has more use of his upper body and hands than his wife and he can push the wheels on his wheelchair. Ted teaches seventh- and eighth-grade science at Paxton Center School.
 "He is awesome," Purcell said. "He still whistles at me."
 With the help of a fertility clinic, Purcell gave birth through cesarean section to Tanner at Memorial Hospital on June 13, 1997. Newspaper and television reporters and cameras crowded into the delivery room to record the first birth in the hospital's history to parents who both used wheelchairs.
 The birth was front-page news in the Telegram & Gazette and was featured on the ABC television show "20/20." When Tanner was 7, the Purcells appeared on television again, this time on TLC's "Amazing Families."
 When Purcell was pregnant, she was sometimes asked if her baby would be disabled as well. One time she joked that he'd be delivered with a wheelchair strapped to his behind.
 "People just don't know," she said. "Education and awareness are so important. That's why I lecture and teach."
 A few times a year, Purcell tells her life story to UMass Memorial Medical Center doctors, nurses and medical students as a guest lecturer. She also lectures at Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences University, Assumption College and Anna Maria College.
 Fewer people look away than they once did when they see Purcell sitting in her wheelchair in public.
 "I don't care if they stare at me," she said. "If they look at me, they're wondering and they're thinking. I always smile and say hello. When people know that I'm OK, they're OK."
 Purcell enjoys people getting to know her.
 "I'm not a wheelchair," she said. "I'm a person."
 Tanner works as a lineman for National Grid. He's always been adventurous. When he was younger, he snowboarded, four-wheeled and dirt-biked, and friends would ask his parents if they were afraid he'd get hurt.
 "We couldn't stop him from living because of us," the Purcells would answer.
 To drive, Purcell presses a fob button that opens the backseat door on the passenger side of her Chrysler Pacifica and lowers a ramp. She backs her wheelchair into the van, then turns it behind the steering wheel and locks it into place. With the splint on her right hand, she moves the tri-pin grip spinner knob that controls the steering and with her left hand she moves another knob that controls the gas pedal, brake and horn.
 In 36 years of driving, she's never been issued a ticket. She has been stopped for speeding three or four times, but after police officers have seen the inside of her specialized van, they've always let her go with a verbal warning.
 "I don't think about being disabled any longer," Purcell said. "I just do my thing. Is it different? Absolutely, but in the end I do things like everybody else does and sometimes more."

Records fell. Firsts occurred. Legends were lost. This was a year of stunning highs -- in the world of sports, in terms of record heat -- and agonizing lows -- history burned, hundreds of lives were lost to shootings and vaping. Here's a look back at 2019.
 Longest shutdown in government history
 The year began with the U.S. government already in a partial shutdown, which stretched to 35 days and became the longest in U.S. history. The shutdown began when President Donald Trump reversed course on a bipartisan funding extension, which forced a partial shutdown.
 The main dispute was Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The Senate rejected two bills that could have ended the 34-day shutdown, but on Jan. 25 Trump signed a deal to end the shutdown until Feb. 15.
 The deal did not include funding for a border wall.
 Trump the disrupter
 • Frustrated by Congress's refusal to fund a border wall with Mexico, a main campaign promise, Trump declared a national emergency to divert $3.6 billion in congressionally appropriated funds from the Defense Department to pay for a border wall. Democrats and even some Republicans criticized the president, and Trump's declaration was challenged in federal court on grounds of separation of powers. On July 26 the Supreme Court ruled in the White House's favor, but Congress continues to attempt to overturn the national emergency decree.
 • President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met in Hanoi, Vietnam, Feb. 27 and 28 in an effort to push North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons. The meeting was cut short and no agreement was reached when the North Koreans angled for an entire lifting of sanctions in return for a partial denuclearization. In June, President Trump attended the 2019 Koreas-United States DMZ Summit with Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, where Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot on North Korean soil.
 • On March 22 special counsel Robert Mueller delivered his report regarding possible Russia-Trump collusion in the 2016 presidential election, concluding that the investigation did not find sufficient evidence that the campaign "coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election- interference activities," but that Russian interference happened. As to allegations of obstruction of justice by the president, the investigation "does not conclude that the President committed a crime"; however, "it also does not exonerate him." While a redacted report was released publicly April 18, as of May 8 the full report cannot be released because the president asserted executive privilege to keep it private.
 • Trade tensions with China spiked, with President Trump imposing sweeping tariffs beginning in July. Neither Trump nor China's President Xi Jinping backed down, leading to a full-blown trade war. The U.S. slapped tariffs on $550 billion worth of Chinese products, while China reacted by setting tariffs on $185 billion in U.S. goods.
 • A whistleblower in the Trump administration released information Sept. 25 regarding a July phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine. When Democrats asked to see the complaint, the White House denied but then changed course and released a summary of the call that raised questions. Though redacted, the rough transcript appears to show Trump asking a foreign leader for a "favor" to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential presidential opponent to Trump in 2020. This led to an impeachment inquiry and the first public presidential impeachment hearings in more than 20 years.
 • On Dec. 18, Trump became the third U.S. president in history to be impeached. The House passed both articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
 Wild weather
 • A dangerous polar vortex swept over the Midwest and Great Lakes regions in January, with wind chills between 40 and 65 degrees below zero and cold so extreme frostbite on exposed skin could occur in minutes.
 A bomb cyclone -- a meteorological term to describe hurricane-like storms at mid-latitudes -- impacted 25 states in March, causing flooding, power outages and intense winter storms. The bad weather started over Colorado and moved east across the central United States wreaking havoc, especially over the Rockies.
 • July officially became the hottest month on record globally, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announcing global temperatures averaging 62.13 degrees. That's 1.71 degrees hotter than the 20th century average.
 • Thousands of individual fires burned in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, peaking in August. The rate of fire was unprecedented and was caused by both naturally occurring events and farmers and loggers clearing land. The world took notice because the Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world and vital to regulating the world's oxygen and carbon cycles.
 • On Sept. 1 Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas with winds peaking at 185 mph. The dangerous category 5 storm -- the most powerful to ever hit the Bahamas -- caused widespread devastation and left 43 people dead. As it moved north, Dorian weakened and stayed about 100 miles off Florida's east coast. Through September and early October, Hurricane Lorenzo, which strengthened to a category 5 then fell to category 3 over the central Atlantic, became the strongest northernmost hurricane ever recorded.
 • In October and into November, fierce Santa Ana winds fanned the flames of California wildfires, driving tens of thousands of people from their homes and leaving hundreds of thousands without power. Some of the biggest included the Getty Fire near the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Kincade Fire and the Easy Fire near the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
 • Between Nov. 10 and 14, hundreds of records fell during a historic autumn cold snap. Record lows included minus 21 F in Turner, Montana, while record- cold high temps included 17 F in Chicago and 38 in McAllen, Texas, on the Mexican border.
 Notre-Dame Cathedral burns
 Possibly caused by a burning cigarette or an electrical malfunction, Notre- Dame Cathedral in Paris erupted in a massive blaze April 15 that nearly destroyed the iconic landmark. Flames shot out of the roof before the cathedral's spire collapsed and the fire consumed most of the roof. A slow rebuilding process began soon after on the Gothic cathedral, which dates from the 12th century.
 Master Archie is born
 Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, the son of Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, was born May 6 in a London hospital. As the first-born son of a duke, he is Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and seventh in line to the British throne.
 Mass shootings
 Back-to-back shootings occurred at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart, with 22 people killed Aug. 3, and less than 14 hours later in downtown Dayton, Ohio, when a gunman killed nine people. The number of mass shootings comes to an average of about one every 15 days, according to Gun Violence Archive.
 A workplace shooting in Virginia Beach, Virginia, in May resulted in 12 deaths.
 In New Zealand, 51 people were killed in the two consecutive Christchurch mosque shootings in March.
 After the attacks, New Zealand's parliament quickly approved gun reform laws.
 Britain's Brexit problem
 After trying but failing to administer Brexit, Theresa May formally resigned as prime minister of the United Kingdom on June 7 but remained in office until July 24, adding more chaos to the process and politics as the country tries to exit from the European Union. She served as prime minister for nearly three years and vowed to deliver Brexit, which continues to prove too complicated to achieve.
 Twists and turns over 3 ½ years have brought uncertainty to the people and delayed business decisions. Current Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues to negotiate trade arrangements in the divorce deal with EU countries.
 Hong Kong protests
 Anti-government protests exploded in Hong Kong starting in June, as residents took to the streets against proposed legislation that would allow extradition of individuals including foreign nationals to mainland China to stand trial. While the bill was withdrawn in September, people continue to protest for democratic reforms and autonomy, and against police brutality.
 Protesters stormed parliament, and the government banned wearing face masks, which protesters defied.
 Vaping deaths
 At least 33 people died due to vaping-related illnesses, and e-cigarettes were linked to many more cases of pulmonary disease, which has affected all states except Alaska. The Trump administration and some states have passed laws banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in an effort to curb their popularity, and in November the CDC said the chemical vitamin E acetate was linked to vaping illnesses.
 Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes
 Airlines around the world grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 airplanes after Nairobi- bound Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed, the second calamity involving that style of airplane.
 All 157 people on board were killed, most of whom were Keynan. On Oct. 29, 2018, Lion Air Flight 610, also a Boeing 737 Max 8, crashed, killing all 189 passengers and crew. The crashes sparked debate on safety, and Boeing executives took questions in congressional hearings. Investigators discovered that Boeing withheld information about a faulty sensor and problems with its flight control system. The company says it wants to restart commercial flights of the Max 8 early in 2020.

I loved the mood of Queen & Slim. I loved the sensuality of it. I loved the unpredictability of its two lead characters -- the young couple on the run (Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith) come together in their effort to escape law enforcement. I loved Waithe's dialogue, and I loved Matsoukas' confident eye. I loved how she sees these characters with sensitivity and clarity, and the way the film is lit. Mostly, though, I found it eye-opening to witness how different it is to run from the law when you're white compared to when you're not. It's hard hitting, without a doubt. It comes to a dramatic, violent close like so many of the best films this year. It is uncompromising in its message and its style. It is by far one of the best films of the year.

Markets on Edge as U.S.-Iran Tensions Flare Up

At the age of three months, Florida's texting-while-driving law has grown its teeth.
   
 The law (HB 107), passed in the last session of the Legislature, went into effect in baby steps. From October to Jan. 1, texting was not allowed, but law enforcement officers were supposed to issue texting drivers written or verbal warnings.
   
 The law also banned the use of handheld cellphones entirely in designated school crossing areas, school zones or highway construction areas. But again, there were just warnings until the start of 2020.
   
 As of Wednesday, things got real. Drivers can get traffic citations, punishable as a moving violation, with three points going against their license for driving while texting -- or for having their phone up to their ears in school and work zones.
   
 Tickets issued for a first offense carry a $30 fine plus court costs. This doubles if you get a second violation within five years.
   
 Florida was late to the game doing this. Lawmakers passed a weak, unenforceable law in 2013. By 2019, when the Legislature passed the new law, 47 other states already had similar laws or stricter ones.
   
 And with good reason. According to the National Highway Transportation and Safety Association, texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.
   
 A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that about 3% of drivers are using their phones while driving at any given time, which is actually an improvement over past years. Still, that's a frightening thing to contemplate on a busy highway. People are not good at multi-tasking, especially at high speeds where a moment's inattention can have frightening results.
   
 Florida had 3,174 traffic crash deaths in 2018, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. It's difficult to know how many were caused by distracted driving, but the department estimates at least 233 were caused by distracted driving.
   
 While there were no deaths caused by distracted driving reported in Alachua County in 2018, there were 11 reported in Marion County and three in Lake County. There were 46 incapacitating injuries related to distracted driving reported in Alachua County that same year, 56 in Marion County and 44 in Lake County. (For county-by-county statistics, visit http://bit.ly/fldistractedrivingdeaths)
   
 These are scary numbers -- which is why it's gratifying to see the Legislature finally take action after years of seeing similar bills die without a hearing.
   
 The Florida Highway Patrol says it has issued about 800 warnings during this interim period. As with seat-belt use, it will take some time for word to reach the average Florida driver that the law has changed. This will no doubt be an unwelcome surprise to many.
   
 But as the public becomes more aware of the law, we can only expect safer driving in the year ahead.

“I’m not going to be hurt by them calling him a ‘career criminal,’” Tim Sr. told the News Tribune. “I already know who my son was and what my son did. I’m not going to hold excuses for his lifestyle. He chose what he did and how he lived.”
 The older Majchrzak believes in protecting gun owners’ rights, too, he said. But the father of six sons also remains protective of his namesake, and was less enthused to learn that his late son has become the subject of a political argument.
 “What my son did in the last moment of his life was a big mistake on his part,” Majchrzak Sr. said. “The police officers involved — I will never disrespect them for what they had to do. As for Stauber, he’s a politician now. Take it for what it’s worth. They all jump on the bandwagon and try to make themselves look good and upright.”
 The officer with Stauber that day, Wright, confirms the congressman's story.
 Wright spoke with the News Tribune in August at his home in the Cody neighborhood of Duluth. He retired from the department as a deputy chief in 2005. The day they encountered Majchrzak, June 23, 2000, Wright recalled he and Stauber gathered at the bottom of the apartment house’s unusually long interior staircase. Wright remembered Stauber in plain clothes, because he had a trainee with him and it was Stauber’s job to blend in as he observed the rookie — details confirmed by police reports.
 They’d been called in the middle of the night, around 3 a.m., after two male victims inside the apartment house reported to dispatchers they'd been held at gunpoint. The men were petrified and afraid to leave, fearing a gunman who threatened to be back, they told police.
 Later, the police would learn that the man who perpetrated the gun threats on the reporting victims was not Majchrzak at all. Given the opportunity, the witnesses couldn't identify Majchrzak as the gunman. Officers never learned why he moved on them in the apartment, gun raised, like he did. The police weren’t even after Majchrzak.
 Following his arrest, Majchrzak wouldn’t cooperate. Before the police turned off the video camera in the interview room, he had fallen asleep, according to police reports.
 But several hours earlier, the apartment house was a live wire. Officers planned their move outside. Not wanting to give himself away, Wright, in uniform, covered up with a green civilian jacket he borrowed from Stauber, a detail written about in Stauber's own report.
 “We’re ready to go up the stairs and Pete grabs me and says, ‘You can go after me, Jim,’” Wright said. “Pete later told me he did it because he knew I had children.”

That meant “Hoo, buddy. You got us.”
 In this season full of unprecedented moments for Young — first win as coach of his dream school, first ACC victory, first upset of a top-five opponent while guiding the orange and maroon — Young’s first exposure to the Tech-UVA rivalry was one he’d like to forget.
 The second-youngest team in all of major-college basketball was blasted and humbled. All its strengths turned to weaknesses, its momentum gained during a four-game winning streak against lesser competition turned to ash.
 “Experiences like that are part of growth,” Young said. “I wish it hadn’t happened — it’s painful — but it did, and I know exactly how they’ll respond. We’ll come back tomorrow and set our jaw and turn our attention to [Syracuse].”
 The best news for the Hokies is that Virginia does this to a lot of people. The No. 19 Cavaliers might hold their lowest national ranking since pre- Thanksgiving in 2017, but they still know how to play world-class defense.
 Virginia held the Hokies to their lowest point total since Super Bowl I (1967) and their fewest points in this series since the year the United Nations held its first meeting (1946).
 Tech, which entered the day No. 1 in the country in fewest turnovers committed per game (9.5), gave it away six times in the first nine minutes of this one.
 “To kick the thing around — sloppy basketball just drives me insane,” Young said, shaking his head.

 Two days later, after beating the Titans, Minshew once more called me Terry. O’Brien posted another tweet that said, “UPDATE: Minshew called @gsmitter Terry again ... it ain’t stopping now.”
 Then things really went crazy.
 At Minshew’s news conference on Oct. 2, after the Jaguars beat Denver, I asked Minshew a question about his sensational TD pass to Ryquell Armstead, in which he scrambled, dodged and ducked Broncos defenders such as Von Miller to buy time for Armstead to get open in the end zone.
 Minshew began with the words, “Well, Terry ...” and went into his recollection of the play. A few seconds into his answer, he couldn’t contain himself and smiled.

Toronto police say a candlelight vigil for an Iranian general killed by a U.S. airstrike -- and a protest by those who opposed him -- ended peacefully on Saturday night.
 Const. Caroline de Kloet says two groups showed up to the event outside a Toronto courthouse a day after Gen. Qassem Soleimani's death was announced.
 Dozens of mourners and protesters attended the Toronto rally, which de Kloet says was not violent.
 She says police were there as a precaution to keep the peace.
 Mourners lit candles at a makeshift memorial by the courthouse, setting a starkly different tone from a celebration of Soleimani's death held in Toronto on Friday.
 Then, attendees danced and cheered, saying they hoped Soleimani's death would mark a rebirth for Iran.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 4, 2019.

 At the age of three months, Florida's texting-while-driving law has grown its teeth.
 The law (HB 107), passed in the last session of the Legislature, went into effect in baby steps. From October to Jan. 1, texting was not allowed, but law enforcement officers were supposed to issue texting drivers written or verbal warnings.
 The law also banned the use of handheld cellphones entirely in designated school crossing areas, school zones or highway construction areas. But again, there were just warnings until the start of 2020.
 As of Wednesday, things got real. Drivers can get traffic citations, punishable as a moving violation, with three points going against their license for driving while texting -- or for having their phone up to their ears in school and work zones.
 Tickets issued for a first offense carry a $30 fine plus court costs. This doubles if you get a second violation within five years.
 Florida was late to the game doing this. Lawmakers passed a weak, unenforceable law in 2013. By 2019, when the Legislature passed the new law, 47 other states already had similar laws or stricter ones.
 And with good reason. According to the National Highway Transportation and Safety Association, texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.
 A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that about 3% of drivers are using their phones while driving at any given time, which is actually an improvement over past years. Still, that's a frightening thing to contemplate on a busy highway. People are not good at multi-tasking, especially at high speeds where a moment's inattention can have frightening results.
 Florida had 3,174 traffic crash deaths in 2018, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. It's difficult to know how many were caused by distracted driving, but the department estimates at least 233 were caused by distracted driving.
 While there were no deaths caused by distracted driving reported in Alachua County in 2018, there were 11 reported in Marion County and three in Lake County. There were 46 incapacitating injuries related to distracted driving reported in Alachua County that same year, 56 in Marion County and 44 in Lake County. (For county-by-county statistics, visit http://bit.ly/fldistractedrivingdeaths)
 These are scary numbers -- which is why it's gratifying to see the Legislature finally take action after years of seeing similar bills die without a hearing.
 The Florida Highway Patrol says it has issued about 800 warnings during this interim period. As with seat-belt use, it will take some time for word to reach the average Florida driver that the law has changed. This will no doubt be an unwelcome surprise to many.
 But as the public becomes more aware of the law, we can only expect safer driving in the year ahead.

BAGHDAD - Iraq was the uneasy epicenter of a region on edge Saturday after the killing of Iran's most prominent military leader, with an angry funeral procession winding through its capital in the morning and rockets falling after dark.
 Adding to the apprehensions was a series of threats and counterthreats from Iran and President Donald Trump, with the U.S. leader tweeting Saturday that targets in Iran would be "hit very fast and very hard" should U.S. assets or personnel be attacked.
 Early Friday, U.S. drone strikes ripped through two cars traveling outside Baghdad's international airport, killing Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a powerful Iraqi militia leader, along with eight other people.
 Iran immediately vowed to seek revenge for the killing of Soleimani, as the Trump administration announced that it was sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East. The tensions continued to build Saturday as NATO announced that it was suspending its training of troops in Iraq and the United States said that it had stepped up security at military bases in the country.
 An Iranian commander quoted by the Tasnim News Agency on Saturday suggested that dozens of U.S. facilities and military assets in the Middle East were at risk, along with Israel, a key U.S. ally.
 "Thirty-five vital American positions in the region are within the reach of the Islamic Republic, and Tel Aviv," the commander, Brig. Gen. Gholamali Abuhamzeh, was quoted as saying. "The Strait of Hormuz is a vital thoroughfare for the West, and a large number of American destroyers and warships cross the Strait of Hormuz, the Sea of Oman and the Persian Gulf," he added.
 Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia backed by Iran, warned members of Iraqi security forces to keep more than half a mile from U.S. military bases, beginning Sunday evening. The militia, which led a siege of the U.S. Embassy before Soleimani's killing, did not say why it issued the warning.
 Trump, tweeting Saturday from his personal resort in West Palm Beach, Florida, appeared to be responding in kind when he said that the United States had targeted multiple sites in Iran and that those targets would be struck should U.S. military sites be attacked or Americans harmed. He also repeated the administration's justification for Soleimani's killing, referring to the Iranian commander as a "terrorist leader" who had been planning additional attacks.
 "Iran has been nothing but a problem for many years," Trump tweeted. "Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!"
 A spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition against the Islamic State said that "we have increased security and defensive measures at the Iraqi bases that host anti-ISIS coalition troops. Our command places protection of U.S. forces, as well as our allies and security partners in the coalition, as the top priority; we remain vigilant and resolute."
 The focal point of the anxiety was Baghdad, where thousands of people joined a funeral procession for Soleimani and Muhandis on Saturday as helicopters shadowed the crowds. "Death to America, death to Israel," people chanted. "We will take our revenge!"
 The procession, which began in Baghdad and moved on to the Iraqi Shiite shrine cities of Najaf and Karbala, offered a vivid display of how both Iran and the United States are deeply entwined in Iraq. The crowds bellowed anti-American cries and vowed to fight to avenge one of Iran's heroes as U.S.-allied Iraqi security forces watched over the chanting throngs. Soleimani's burial is scheduled for Tuesday in Kerman, his hometown in southeastern Iran.
 Later Saturday, rockets were fired toward Baghdad's Green Zone, site of the U.S. Embassy, and at an air base hosting U.S. troops north of Baghdad, but they caused no casualties, according to Iraqi and U.S. officials, who did not say who had fired the rockets.
 The White House delivered a formal notification of the drone strike that killed Soleimani to Congress on Saturday, as is required under the War Powers Act. The report is completely classified, according to a senior Democratic aide, but probably details the administration's justification for the strike, as well as the constitutional and legislative rationale used to send troops.
 It was unclear whether the administration would issue a nonclassified version that could be publicized.
 NATO, which has several hundred personnel in Iraq, said Saturday that it has temporarily suspended its training of Iraqi forces to counter the Islamic State, according to Dylan White, a NATO spokesman. "The safety of our personnel in Iraq is paramount. We continue to take all precautions necessary," he said in an emailed statement.
 Elsewhere, regional governments were scrambling to avoid further outbreaks of violence.
 Qatar's foreign minister traveled to Tehran on Saturday and discussed "ways to maintain collective security of the region" with his Iranian counterpart, the Qatar News Agency said.
 In Saudi Arabia, King Salman called Iraq's president, Barham Salih, and discussed "the importance of calm and defusing the crisis in the region," the Saudi Press Agency reported.
 Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states have reacted nervously to the escalating tensions because of their proximity to Iran and fears of a backlash due to their close partnerships, including military cooperation, with the United States.
 The drone attack early Friday local time struck a two-vehicle convoy on an access road near Baghdad International Airport and also killed several of Soleimani's local allies. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called the attack "an assassination" that was a "flagrant violation of the conditions authorizing the presence of U.S. troops" on Iraqi soil.
 Abdul-Karim Khalaf, a security spokesman for Iraq's prime minister, said Saturday that authorities were investigating crew members who were on the aircraft that brought Soleimani to Baghdad, reportedly from Damascus - apparently to determine how the United States learned of the Iranian commander's whereabouts.
 Khalaf, speaking to Iraq's state news agency, reiterated that U.S. forces are not allowed to conduct military operations in Iraq without the approval of the prime minister, and he hinted that their future in the country is in doubt.
 "We have alternatives to train our armed forces," Khalaf said.

LOWVILLE — At 29 years old, Meghann Hellinger has already started her own day spa, capitalized on a prime location change opportunity and embraced starting another new business that evolved from that change, all in less than two years.
 As a result, Lowville’s historic Bateman Hotel is having another renaissance and the taps will flow at the tavern for the first time since the 1980s.
 “I started doing massage therapy because I was a bartender and I was really tired of curing people’s problems with alcohol,” Mrs. Hellinger said, “So I wanted to focus on bringing another way for people to feel good other than with alcohol,” Mrs. Hellinger said, with a touch of irony.
 After being a self-employed massage therapist at Open Sky Wellness for over three years, Mrs. Hellinger decided she wanted more, which resulted in opening her own shop, the Drift Day Spa on Elm Street in the village, in October 2018.
 Mrs. Hellinger credits Kathleen Merrick, the originator of Open Sky Wellness, with creating the massage market locally, but now, she said, the impact of massage speaks for itself.
 “Once you get someone in for an initial appointment and they realize how helpful it is, they’re sold,” she said, especially for people trying to manage pain issues without opioids or other medications.
 By May, the business was doing very well and with a vision of expanding to include hair services, it was already time for a change.
 “The place on Elm Street was fine, but we needed a bigger space to be able to bring in more people,” Mrs. Hellinger said.
 The Bateman, with its downtown location, deep history and character, was exactly what she hoped to find. She crunched the numbers with the help and support of her husband, Brandon, and she reopened in her new shop on Aug. 1.
 “It’s been more money management than having money,” Mr. Hellinger said about how they were able to start the business and change locations in less than a year and then plan to open a second, very different business in less than two without going into debt.
 He said they have invested their savings, proceeds from the spa and even cash gifts from their September wedding to make it all happen.
 A carpenter by trade, Mr. Hellinger is, they both agree, the man behind the scenes that has made their businesses possible.
 Mrs. Hellinger focuses on “public success” by providing the vision, branding and running the business, she said, but for her husband, success is more personal.
 “The more knowledge I can acquire the happier I am, but that doesn’t always translate into other people thinking I’m successful,” he said.
 While Mr. Hellinger handles much of the paperwork and accounting, Mrs. Hellinger said his carpentry skills made Drift possible in both locations and minimizes the risk of taking on the bar.
 Mr. Hellinger custom-built and soundproofed two massage rooms in the Bateman in a way that maintained the integrity of the vintage architecture, work which would have otherwise cost thousands of dollars, she said.
 The couple plans to take the same approach to the draft house: they have no desire to paint the exposed brick or the wood bar, nor to replace the marble and brass detailing, instead preferring to embrace the vintage and keep the “speak easy” ambiance, just in time for the new ‘20s.
 Their concept is to have 24 taps with craft beers, locally produced wine, malted ciders, New York state-only distilled spirits and to serve soups, salads and sandwiches homemade each morning to get things started.
 “We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves with food, at first we weren’t even considering it,” Mrs. Hellinger said, but it’s required for the type of liquor license they want.
 At first, they weren’t considering opening a bar at all.
 When the owner of the business in the old Bateman tavern space next to the spa announced their closing, Mrs. Hellenger knew she wanted the space that shares a connecting door with Drift, maybe for tanning beds.
 After she had seen it though, she knew it was not meant for tanning.
 “I thought, when you look at it, how’s it supposed to be anything else?” Mrs. Hellinger said, “So when we were down in New Jersey for the weekend, on our way home and I kind of looked at my husband and I was like, ‘So what do you think about possibly opening a bar? You can say no. It’s fine.’”
 It turned out her husband was thinking the same thing and with his love of craft beers and her appreciation of wine and cider, the Bateman Draft House idea was conceived.
 “This happened to work out perfectly for us. Had there not been a bar there already, we wouldn’t be doing what we’re doing, but we feel we need to bring that back to life. It was empty and used as storage for a long time before the last business,” she said.
 After already receiving a positive recommendation by the county planning board, the couple will head back to the village planning board later this month for final approval. They are also in the process of applying for their liquor license and hope to be able to open the Draft House within the next six months.
 Mrs. Hellinger shared some advice for potential young entrepreneurs hesitant to start something new or strike out on their own that was given to her early in life and stuck.
 “Someone told me if you don’t try, you’re always going to wonder why you didn’t and that’s going to eat you alive more than failing. I think that’s what has pushed me to go for it,” she said, “To not try — that fail is a bigger fail than failing.”

Gaskins went 4-0.
 And Powhatan High School wrestling went 3-1 overall across their four duals, taking wins of 57-20 over Smithfield, 52-33 over Patrick Henry and 60-9 over Varina and getting dealt a narrow 32-30 setback to Hanover.
 For the whole day, Powhatan only lost three matches by getting pinned.
 But wins by pins were plentiful for the Indians. Gaskins earned three pins alone, including one against Varina after battling back from a 4-0 first- period deficit to take command of the match with a reversal and build towards the pin with a couple of near-falls.
 The junior also defeated Smithfield’s Cameron Hatchett on a 5-1 decision.
 “He’s looked really good,” Tanaka said of Gaskins. “He’s always been a dedicated wrestler, but I think he’s kind of pushed himself a little bit more and I think we’re starting to see the results of that. Very happy for him – hopefully we can continue his trajectory as it moves forward.”
 Proffitt actually got to wrestle up at 126 – with junior Sean Hall going up to 132 and Gavin Timmons bumping up to 138 – and he picked up two pins before mixing in three takedowns and a couple of near-falls to beat Patrick Henry’s Sam Fox by tech fall.
 Hall went 3-1 while wrestling up a weight class, earning all three of his wins by pin and holding his one winning opponent, Smithfield’s Mason Parker – the 132 weight-class Toys 4 Tots Tourney champion at Ocean Lakes High School – to 3 points on an 8-7 decision.
 Timmons also picked up two hard-earned victories while wrestling up a weight class. After trailing Smithfield's Roberto Hines 4-1 at the end of the first period, Timmons got an escape, got a hold of his opponent’s leg and worked the grab into a takedown of Hines to tie the match at 4-all. He ended the second period with a near-fall to take the lead, then pinned Hines with 45 seconds left in the third. He ended the duals by pinning Varina’s Tyree Nash.
 Shining brightly at 160 for Powhatan was Adam Camp. The sophomore enjoyed a breakout performance as went 3-1 – and earned all three of his wins by pins.
 It’s his first year in the varsity lineup, and Tanaka said he’s been kind of feeling his way through. But one of the things that’s helped Camp – Tanak noted – is that he’s gotten to wrestle a lot with teammate Matthew Bales, who did well in the Lee-Davis Holiday Classic before the break, placing 5th.
 Dylan Coward returned to the 106 weight-class spot with freshman Kieran Hathaway still feeling under the weather following the wrestlers’ trip to the Knockout Christmas Classic in Kissimmee, Florida. The hard-working sophomore closed-out the duals with two contested victories to his name, one at 106 and another at 113. He tied Patrick Henry’s Elias Sotos up to 7-all, then tipped the scales in the waning seconds on a near-fall to take the 10-7 decision. He built on his 3-point win with a 6-point first-period pin against Varina in the 113 weight class. He also came close in the decisive last match of Powhatan’s dual with Hanover as he helped force overtime, but Hayden Bowles narrowly won 8-6 with a sudden-death takedown.

HOUSTON -- Deshaun Watson threw a touchdown pass and ran for a score in regulation and then led the winning drive in overtime as the Texans added another comeback to Houston playoff history by rallying from a double-digit, second-half deficit for a 22-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the playoffs Saturday.
 Both teams had to punt on their first possessions of overtime. On Houston's next drive, Watson evaded a sack by wriggling away from one defender and bouncing off another before rolling out to find Taiwan Jones for a 34-yard reception to set up first-and-goal.
 Ka'imi Fairbairn then kicked a 28-yard field goal to lift Houston to the victory.
 The Texans scored 19 straight points to take the lead before Steven Hauschka's 47-yard field goal tied it with 5 seconds left to force overtime.
 The win gives the Texans their first playoff victory since the 2016 season and extends Buffalo's postseason losing streak to six games, with their most recent playoff win coming in 1995. It's the first wild-card overtime game since the Broncos beat the Steelers, 29-23, in the 2011 season.
 The game conjured memories of another huge comeback in a wild-card game. The last time teams from Houston and Buffalo met in the playoffs it was in a game that is known as "The Comeback." The Bills set an NFL record for the largest comeback in NFL history by rallying from a 32-point deficit for a 41-38 overtime win against the Houston Oilers in a wild-card game in 1993.
 This time Josh Allen and the Bills used a dominant first half to build a 13-point lead and were up, 16-0, in the third quarter.
 Watson had 247 yards passing and ran for 55 yards and DeAndre Hopkins had 90 yards receiving.
 Allen threw for 264 yards, ran for 92 and caught a touchdown pass on a trick play in the first quarter, but often looked rattled late in his playoff debut.
 Three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt had a sack and gave a boost to Houston's defense in his return after sitting out since October with a torn pectoral muscle.
 "This is why you come back," Watt said. "I don't know if I meant to come back for these many plays or this much extra time, but these feelings, these emotions, these fans, these players, Deshaun Watson and all the guys on this team, this is why you come back."
 Houston couldn't get anything going on offense before halftime and had 81 yards in a first half where Hopkins didn't catch a pass for the first time since Week 16 of the 2017 season.
 They were finally able to sustain a drive on their second possession of the third quarter when Hopkins had receptions of 14 and 10 yards to help move the ball. The Texans cut the lead to 10 when Watson dragged two defenders into the end zone on a 20-yard touchdown run.
 Watson then dived into the end zone for a 2-point conversion that got Houston within 16-8 with about two minutes left in the third.
 The Bills were driving early in the fourth quarter when Allen was sacked by Whitney Mercilus and fumbled, and it was recovered by Jacob Martin at the Buffalo 47. Houston cashed in on the miscue with a 41-yard field goal that cut the lead to 16-11 with about 11 minutes to go.
 Watson connected with Carlos Hyde on a 5-yard touchdown pass and Hopkins on a 2-point conversion with about five minutes left to put the Texans on top, 19-16. Hopkins had a 41-yard reception earlier in that drive.
 The Bills were in field goal range on their next drive when Allen got a 14-yard penalty for intentional grounding and Buffalo lost a down to bring up fourth down. They went for it, and Allen was sacked by Jacob Martin for a 19-yard loss to give Houston the ball back with 1:41 left.
 The Texans trailed, 13-0, at halftime and Hopkins fumbled on their opening drive of the third quarter to give Buffalo the ball at the Houston 32. Watt sacked Allen for a loss of 8 yards on third down and the Bills settled for a 38-yard field goal to extend the lead to 16-0.
 Allen scrambled 42 yards for a first down on Buffalo's first possession for its longest rush of the season. Two plays later, the Bills used some trickery to take the lead when John Brown threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Allen to make it 7-0. Brown's pass was wobbly, but Allen was wide open despite having to slow down to grab it.
 It was early in the second quarter when Allen appeared to fumble, and it was recovered by Houston. But the play was reviewed and overturned, giving Buffalo the ball at the Houston 32. The Bills were unable to move the ball after that and made a 40-yard field goal to make it 10-0.
 The Bills added another 40-yard field goal at the end of the second quarter to push the lead to 13-0 at halftime.

There were some true diamonds in the rough out there to choose from, and even though people are decrying the impact of studio consolidation, there is still room to make an impression. It's still possible to have a trailer that's bold, takes some risks, and plays with the format a little. A bigger budget does not always equal a better trailer, and the notable exclusions of this year's top- grossing films on this list, with one exception, is proof of that. These are my opinions as someone who has been doing this for 15 years now, but at the end of the day, I'm just one jamoke who's watched way too many trailers.
