Trump issued the proclamation in October 2019, directing officials to refuse visas to immigrants who aren’t covered by an “approved” health insurance plan and don’t have enough money to pay out of pocket for their doctor bills. At the time, the president justified the proclamation with an unsubstantiated claim that it would prevent the government from assuming the “burden” of covering immigrant health care.

STURGIS, S.D. (AP) — A South Dakota teenager plans to plead guilty to manslaughter in the death of a 16-year-old Wyoming girl whose body was found in his basement last fall, attorneys said.
 The 17-year-old defendant originally was charged as an adult with alternative counts of first- and second-degree murder in the killing of Shayna Ritthaler of Upton, Wyoming. Meade County State’s Attorney Michele Bordewyk told the Rapid City Journal the boy is expected to plead guilty to manslaughter on Thursday. He originally pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.
 Bordewyk and the teen's defense attorney, Steven Titus, have agreed to ask the judge for a 55-year sentence, but the judge does not have to agree to their recommendation.
 Titus called it a “sad situation for everyone involved.”
 Titus said he hopes the judge agrees to the sentence since it gives the teen “a light at the end of the tunnel” by making him eligible for parole in his early 40s.
 Titus had planned on arguing that his client should be transferred to juvenile court, but that hearing was canceled given the plea deal. The Associated Press isn’t naming the defendant because his case might end up back in juvenile court.
 Titus said the plea deal also means he’s dropping the insanity defense, which argued that the defendant was not mentally competent at the time of the killing.

BOSTON -- Gov. Charlie Baker took a step toward preparing the public for what the future may hold, ordering all citizens to wear masks or facial coverings in public if they can't socially distance.
 The executive order signed by Baker on Friday put added weight behind what had only been a recommendation from his administration up until now. It also gives businesses the authority to deny someone service if they don't wear a mask.
 "We view this as common sense and an important way on a statewide basis to establish for the long term a set of standards for what we would call the new normal," Baker said Friday during an afternoon briefing from the State House.
 The order does not apply to children under 2 or anyone who cannot wear a mask because of a medical condition, and Baker said the Department of Public Health would be putting together guidelines for children aged 2 to 5.
 The facial coverings, Baker said, don't have to be proper masks, but can be T-shirts or bandanas. He urged that people reserve medical grade masks for front-line health care workers.
 The order supercedes an advisory issued by his administration on April 10 encouraging people to wear masks if they couldn't socially distance, and comes the same week Baker gave Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito a little over two weeks to craft a plan to begin a phased in reopening of the economy as soon as this month.
 Baker said that he thought "people for the most part" adhered to the recommendation he made on April 10 to use a face covering in public.
 "But I think we all believe that as part of the strategy around anything associated with reopening people are going to need a mask or a face covering if they're going to be close to people. You can't always stay 6 feet away, and even if you can stay 6 feet away, especially if you're inside, you probably ought to have a face covering on," Baker said.
 Under the new order that takes effect May 6, all employees and customers of grocery stores, pharmacies and other retail establishments that have been allowed to stay open during the public health emergency must wear masks at all times. The same goes for users and drivers of taxis, ride-hailing services and public transit.
 Failure to comply can result in a fine of up $300.
 Baker said some businesses and municipalities have already put in place similar policies.
 "It's a big change, I think, for many people, but I'm hoping we get to the point where, as we move down the road here, I'm hoping we get to the point where it becomes the norm, because it should be," Baker said.
 Asked specifically about joggers and bicyclists, Baker said if someone is running early in the morning and confident they won't encounter other people they might be able to exercise without a mask, but if they go running during the afternoon when more people are out they should probably cover their face.
 The Department of Public Health reported another 2,106 positive cases of COVID-19 on Friday and 154 new deaths from the disease, putting the total to date at 3,716 deaths.
 The number of patients hospitalized with coronavirus continued to fall by another 87 patients.
 Baker said the trend lines have moved "a little bit in the right direction," but he wanted to be careful not to try to rush a reopening of businesses and relaxation of safety precautions in a way that would risk a resurgence.
 "By reopening, we could actually create another fire and be dealing with this thing all over again at some point shortly down the road," Baker said. "When we reopen we want to do it based on the right data at the right time with the right mechanisms in place to monitor this so we only have to do this once. Because the calamity and economic hardship associated with it is absolutely not something any of us wants to have to put up with again."
 The state's testing efforts continue to expand as well. The DPH reported 13,989 new tests conducted in Friday's daily report, which was the second highest total ever recorded for a single-day.
 Baker said as part of his administration's testing program, the partnership between Quest Diagnostics and the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers to send 1,700 testing kits daily to these provider organizations had been expanded from the 12 initial centers to include five more.
 Sue Joss, the CEO of Brockton Neighborhood Health Center, said her center has tested 2,341 patients, and found 837 cases with a positive rate, twice the state average. Brockton has been identified as one of the hot spots for coronavirus in the state, along with other cities like Chelsea, and Joss said that made it clear to her that the center needed to be doing more testing.

Loyalty to family is admirable, but limiting yourself to just one bank's brood of credit cards may be a tie that binds you up.
 Sure, having all your cards under a single bank roof can simplify bookkeeping, and it may even grant you access to bonus "relationship" rewards. It can make reward redemptions seamless and, sometimes, more valuable if you're able to pool those rewards across multiple cards.
 But if you never venture beyond your own bank's nest, you might miss out on more valuable rewards, perks and features. Here are some reasons to branch out.
 RICHER INCENTIVES
 Rewards rates and sign-up bonuses vary widely among issuers -- and they can be effective lures. A 2019 study from J.D. Power found that over a 12-month time frame, 45% of credit card customers switched cards for a better rewards program, and 18% switched for a sign-up offer, says John Cabell, director of banking and payments intelligence at J.D. Power.
 Katie Brewer, a certified financial planner at Your Richest Life, a financial planning firm, moved from an airline credit card to a general travel card from another issuer. "We switched to one that's a little bit more flexible where you can either use it (for) travel rewards, or you can do a gift card or you can do cash," she says.
 Even if your bank already offers a card that meets your needs, try combining it with a product from a different institution to maximize rewards. If your bank's credit card earns 1.5% back on all purchases, get a card from another issuer that earns 3% back in specific bonus categories where you spend heavily and use the cards in tandem.
 ADDITIONAL SIDE PERKS
 Especially for frequent travelers, secondary benefits can matter. Your current cash-back card might offer protections like extended warranty or cell phone insurance, but it may not come with rental car insurance or lost luggage reimbursement. And it almost certainly won't grant you juicy travel perks like airport lounge access.
 For that, you'd want a travel credit card that earns miles or points. The best ones don't charge foreign transaction fees, so if your current card does -- or if it doesn't run on Visa or Mastercard, the two most accepted payment networks internationally -- it might be time to look elsewhere.
 LOWER INTEREST RATES
 If you're looking to pay down existing debt via a balance transfer, you may qualify for a 0% introductory APR from another institution.
 These offers can save you a bundle on interest as you attack your debt. "If you're paying 22%, 29% interest, it's really tough to pay down that balance when half of your payment, if not more, is going to interest only," says Jay Funyak, a financial adviser at MFA Wealth, a financial planning firm.
 Same-issuer transfers generally aren't allowed, Funyak notes, meaning you can't transfer a balance on one Citibank card to a different Citi card. In that scenario, you'd have to look beyond the walls of your bank.
 Of course 0% APR offers expire and aren't ideal for revolving balances. For those, a low-interest credit card at a bank or credit union can save you money.
 A HIGHER CREDIT LIMIT
 A different issuer may offer you a higher credit limit on a new card than what you'd get from your current bank.
 A higher credit limit means more potential purchasing power, and it can also benefit your credit scores by lowering your credit utilization, which is the amount of your available credit you're using. In general, lower utilization is better for your scores. If you have a $1,000 balance on a card with a $2,000 credit limit, your utilization is 50%. If the credit limit is $4,000, your utilization is only 25%.
 TIPS FOR MANAGING MULTIPLE CREDIT CARDS
 Applying for cards outside of your bank's suite of products can be worth your while, but juggling multiple cards can get complicated.
 If you're not organized, you could end up paying late accidentally or losing track of how much you're really spending, Brewer says. A solution she suggests is using one card for variable expenses and putting fixed expenses on another.
 Also consider:
 -- Signing up for credit card alerts to track spending.
 -- Setting up automatic monthly payments to avoid slip-ups.
 -- Changing payment due dates to get all cards on the same payment schedule.
 -- Setting reminders for annual fee due dates, reward expiration dates, etc.

Initial unconfirmed reports indicated Bolsonaro had tested positive himself but then he announced on social media his results had come back negative. He has refused to produce the actual document, citing medical privacy.
 Last week, a federal judge in São Paulo ordered Bolsonaro to present the results in response to a request from the O Estado de S. Pãulo newspaper. Bolsonaro’s attorney-general instead sent a summary of the results, the office said in a statement. The judge again insisted on the actual results, and a separate judge on Saturday gave Bolsonaro's team five days to comply.
 Bolsonaro has also further muddied the waters recently. Following the lawsuits, he said last week he had “perhaps” contracted the virus without knowing it.
 All the while, Bolsonaro has kept appearing in public without a mask, addressing crowds and shaking well-wishers’ hands — on one occasion, after wiping his nose.
 Bolsonaro’s support among a core base has long seemed nearly unshakable. While a positive result might not challenge that, it would likely erode support from moderates – the portion of people who are not die-hard but believe his policies are reasonable, said Lucas de Aragão, partner at the Brasilia-based consultancy Arko Advice.
 “All this creates an environment of institutional crisis," said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in São Paulo. "Constitutional crises are complicated because when institutions no longer resolve controversies and conflicts, then who does? The use of force?”
 As the political and economic crisis deriving from the pandemic deepens in Brazil, Bolsonaro might try to further discredit democratic institutions, looking for someone to blame to weather the storm, analysts said.
 “This is why he is bashing the governors and judiciary,” said de Aragão. “The Bolsonaro government and his most influential advocates are always looking for a common enemy, because this creates a sense of community among supporters.”
 Some of that can already be seen unfolding. Over the weekend, Bolsonaro’s core base made the hashtag #CoupFromTheSupremeCourt trend on Twitter in Brazil. Meanwhile in the capital of Brasilia on Sunday, protesters shouted slogans such as: “Careful, Justices, your robes will turn into handcuffs.”
 “We want our president to be able to govern,” Bia Kicis, a lawmaker who appeared next to Bolsonaro on Sunday, said in a live broadcast on the president’s Facebook page. “Our people are not going to let (Supreme Court) Justices, with the stroke of a pen, prevent our president from governing!”
 Experts said the president was playing a dangerous game by taking his legal battles to the streets. “Why not appeal? Why go to the streets?” asked Melo. “This is populism. It's not understanding the constitutional appeals process in the country.”

Hall reconnected with former classmates, teammates and the coaching staff, including head coach Mark Few, who needled the former point guard about putting on a few pounds.
 The Northwest Passages event raised $18,500 for the Halls. A GoFundMe page set up by close friend Wes Oliver generated more than $15,000.
 “More than anything, what was really pleasant for me was to see a lot of old friends and teammates. That’s uplifting in itself,” Hall said. “Having that break and breather from this daily life, to see (former teammate) Matt Santangelo, Wes and Coach Few, it was really enlightening for us all. You need that.”
 And one more thing: “You tell coach Few I could bench press more than him now, he’ll be impressed by that,” Hall chuckled. “I’ve been working out.”
 That’s in his spare time. Hall, a junior high physical education teacher, had returned to work and his sons had returned to school before the coronavirus outbreak reached the islands and shut down nonessential businesses. As of Friday, the Bahamas had 81 confirmed cases and 11 deaths.
 “We were back in school and now that’s taken away from us again,” Hall said. “It feels like (schools have been closed) for two months, forgive me if I’m forgetting some weeks. You forget stuff.”
 Hall’s typical day includes dropping Vanessa off at work, making meals for the family and checking off items on the house’s lengthy to-do list. His boys are keeping up with their studies virtually on their tablets.
 High winds and knee-deep water caused extensive damage to Hall’s house on Grand Bahama Island, but he’s making progress with repairs.
 “We had to take out everything, clean it out and I spent a whole lot of time dealing with the back side of the roof,” he said. “It had a lot of leaks, but we were able to reshingle. It’s back up and it seems to be steady. Hopefully, I did a good job.
 “I’m taking it one day at a time. I’ve been fortunate, a lot of people have come and helped me. It’s amazing how much help we’ve received.”

She says she started with The Connor Group in December after 23 years in the restaurant industry.“My husband has not been working for sixweeks, so him being a stay-at-home dad and being laid off... it just came at the perfect time and just relieved stress for our family,” she said.Copyright 2020 WXIX.

Attorney Jeffrey Kurzon, representing Yang and others, said the case was about protecting the rights of citizens to vote.
 Kurzon said those who brought the lawsuits “must be protected for our democracy to survive" and asked that U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres declare the decision to cancel the democratic presidential primary unconstitutional.

Developing countries in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa could become leading contributors to the global polysilicon market in the coming years due to the steady growth of the solar photovoltaics sector in these regions in the last few years. Cheap solar photovoltaic installations have become the norm in underdeveloped regions, and while this constricts the demand for the more expensive polysilicon, the boost to the solar industry is likely to help the polysilicon market in the long run. Southeast Asian economies such as China and India have become leading producers of solar power in the last few years and are thus likely to remain key regional players in the global polysilicon market.

DUBLIN, Calif. (AP) — A man facing a second trial after a fire killed 36 partygoers at a San Francisco Bay Area warehouse he's accused of illegally converting into a cluttered artists enclave was released from jail Monday over coronavirus concerns.
 Derick Almena, who's been behind bars since 2017, was released after a court hearing by phone, the Alameda County sheriff's office said. He will be under electronic monitoring while he waits for a new trial.
 The 50-year-old is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the Dec. 2, 2016, fire that swept through an electronic music party at the so-called Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland. Prosecutors allege Almena, who was the master tenant on the lease, was criminally negligent when he turned the industrial building into a residence for artists and held events without proper permits.
 The building was packed with furniture, extension cords and other flammable material but had only two exits and no smoke detectors, fire alarms or sprinklers, prosecutors say.
 A jury deadlocked on the charges in September and a new trial has been scheduled for July. His co-defendant, Max Harris, was acquitted of the same charges.
 At least 35 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported at the Santa Rita Jail where Almena was held. According to his attorneys, a report by jail medical staff said Almena’s psychological and physical health were in jeopardy.

The president’s performance incensed Democratic lawmakers.
 “What the American people want to see is their president rising to the moment and providing real leadership during this crisis, not using our sacred national monuments as brazenly political backdrops,” Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee for the Interior Department and the environment.
 “Instead, President Trump chose to sit inside the Lincoln Memorial — a solemn and hallowed place in our national heritage — to berate the press, play the victim and spread falsehoods during a global emergency,” he said. “The National Mall belongs to the American people, and continuing to give the president free rein to use it for political grandstanding is a terrible mistake.”
 In a statement, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, called the event a “moment of national unity” that brought Americans together.
