Moving to interest and taxes. Net interest and other expense in Q3 of fiscal 2020 decreased to $4.7 million from $5.6 million in the same prior year period as a result of reduced average levels of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and lower average interest rates. On the tax side, excluding the impact of discrete tax items, our effective tax rate in Q2 of fiscal 2020 was 23.7% compared to 28.6% in Q3 of fiscal 2019. We recognized discrete tax benefits of $5.1 million compared to $0.7 million in the comparable prior year period. As a result, we reported a tax benefit under GAAP of 3.4% in Q3 of fiscal 2020 compared to a tax provision of 26% in Q3 of fiscal 2019. For the nine months ended March 31, 2020, our normalized effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, was 26.7%.

HOWE - Founders Day will go on, albeit later than initially planned.
   
 Originally set for this weekend, the event is now tentatively scheduled for 2-8 p.m. May 30.
   
 However, that date could change depending on the status of COVID-19 social distancing requirements.
   
 "If we have to keep pushing it back, we will probably reschedule for some time deep into the summer," Howe Director of Economic Development Monte Walker said. "So far, the band is still good and none of our vendors have canceled."
   
 Howe Founders Day was first held in conjunction with the 1986 Texas Sesquicentennial. The inaugural festival included a PCRA rodeo competition. It flourished for many years before going into a gradual decline.
   
 By the late 2000s, the festival seemed to be on life support. Then, in 2015, city leaders began working to reestablish it.
   
 This year's festival is shaping up to be the biggest one yet.
   
 Country-rock band Bent Tree will return for the fourth year. More than 80 vendors have signed up to participate, which is about 10 more than last year.
   
 To accommodate the additional traffic that is anticipated, the festival will occupy part of both Haning and O'Connell streets, which will be lined with booths of artists, jewelers, craft makers, community leaders and more. There will be plenty of food for families to enjoy as well.
   
 Speaking of families, there will also be a kids' zone that includes a bounce house. The Interurban kids train will be making rounds through the downtown area.
   
 According to Walker, a lack of sponsorships may be the biggest challenge facing the festival at this point.
   
 Economic hardships brought on the by COVID-19 restrictions mean many businesses are running on tighter budgets than normal. That has left the festival in dire need of a sponsor for the kids' activities.
   
 Despite the challenges, city officials vow to make this year's festival one to remember. They are hopeful it will be held in May, but if not, it will be rescheduled to a date that works.
   
 "Whenever we have it, we will throw one big party," Walker said.

Thank you very much, Alex, and good morning, everybody. So starting off here with the financial highlights for the quarter. I think we can characterize this as yet another very strong financial performance for the quarter. Obviously, most of the Q1 was still shattered from the impact of the COVID-19, a scenario which will obviously change as we go into Q2. But sticking with the first quarter. Sales volumes of slightly higher than what we produced, overlifted. So 153,000 barrels oil equivalent per day was the sales volume lifted, and that was split into 17.6 oil cargoes and then some gas and condensate in addition to that.

It was happier and less red, and aside from a few hormonal pimples, the acne rash was totally gone.

POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. (AP) — American taxpayers helped pay for the sand on the Maryland Avenue beach, a popular spot on the New Jersey shore that was devastated by Superstorm Sandy and that has since been rebuilt and maintained with federal money.
 Slated to reopen in mid-May, the plan was for only residents of Point Pleasant Beach to use it, at least at first.
 But on Friday afternoon, New Jersey's governor threw cold water on that plan, which is also being used by some shore towns around the country as they inch back toward resuming normal activities in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.
 Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said reopening public beaches is a local decision. But in doing so, he said, the entire public has to be allowed on the sand.
 “A township cannot actually legally restrict folks from outside of their township,” Murphy said. “So that’s not actually within their right to do so.”
 From Maine to Florida, officials in some towns say the restrictions are a necessary first step to see if limited beach crowds comply with distancing requirements; the answer will go a long way toward deciding when, or even if, the beaches will be opened up to everyone.

Best known for her role as Mammy in 1939 movie Gone With The Wind, for which she became the first person of colour to win an Academy Award, Hattie McDaniel was a groundbreaking figure in the entertainment industry. As well as appearing on the big screen, she was also a TV star and recording artist, becoming the first Black woman to sing on the radio in America. In Netflix's Hollywood, she's portrayed by legendary singer and actress Queen Latifah, where she's seen with both male and female lovers. Many film historians believe Hattie was bisexual, while some claim she was a member of the Sewing Circle, a secretive group of Hollywood lesbians and bisexual actresses. Despite receiving critical acclaim and an Academy Award for her role in Gone With The Wind, Hattie faced intense racism and injustice within the industry - she was banned from attending the film's Atlanta premiere, and was made to sit at the back at the Academy Awards, away from her co-stars, as the venue had a 'No Black People' policy.

We had a good first quarter, particularly in light of the impact from the coronavirus in China in February and then the bigger impact it had across the globe in March. Our end markets were largely in line with our projections for the first 2 months of the year, then in early March, we began to experience various adverse impacts from the virus. Our execution was good, both in regards to our results as well as our quick response to the impact from the virus. For the quarter, organic revenue was up 3% from the fourth quarter and down 9% from the first quarter of 2019. The acquisitions of BEKA and Diamond added 5% to our revenue and currency was just under negative 2% for a net of negative 6% from last year. We delivered $1.11 of earnings per share and 19.2% EBITDA margins despite the weak finish to the quarter. EBITDA margins were up almost 300 basis points from the fourth quarter.

I will also guarantee this: If the folks at the University of Delaware do as Marcus asks, and they find nothing, that will satisfy nobody. Once this kind of story gets rolling, there's always supposed to be another memo, another email, another billing record. The argument that answering "legitimate questions" will put anything like this to rest has been refuted, time and time again, since at least the pursuit of the Whitewater affair in the early 1990s. Indeed, on Friday, writing about the situation, _The New York Times_ __' s __ media correspondent sought out for quotation Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of raping her. The name "Donald Trump" appears nowhere in the article, and the central point that somehow the media was too soft on Clinton sounds hallucinatory to anyone who lived through it.
 It is also not unfair to point out that Republicans somehow have an acquired partial immunity to this dynamic. Those people citing the Brett Kavanaugh hearings in discussing the Reade accusations have to confront the fact that, even though Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings were spectacularly dramatic, the guy still was confirmed and will now work his magic for a couple of decades. The same can be said of Clarence Thomas. Democratic presidents do not share this sturdy political immune system. You can ask Lani Guiner or Kimba Wood, on whom Bill Clinton bailed, or Van Jones, whom the Obama administration abandoned. You can ask former Senator Al Franken. You can feel the flinch coming every time some conservative who has spent two years blowing off the #MeToo movement uses it now as a cudgel in this context.
 I have no doubt that this story is now part of the campaign narrative, especially since there is no apparent actual campaign going on due to the pandemic. How crucial it will be is completely up in the air, because everything about this election has been blown to shrapnel by the pandemic, which likely will be the only real issue driving any election for the foreseeable future. Nothing is solid in our politics anymore.

JEFFERSON CITY – During Thursday’s, April 30, COVID-19 briefing, Gov. Mike Parson highlighted housing assistance and resources for Missourians amid the COVID-19 crisis.
 Under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Missouri will receive funding for additional resources to help meet emerging needs, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and the Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) program.
 Existing emergency CDBG regulations allow for grant payments to providers of items and services such as food, clothing, housing, or utilities on behalf of an individual or family. With this funding under the CARES Act, 15 of Missouri’s largest cities and counties, including the St. Louis and Kansas City metro regions, will receive more than $24 million dollars in assistance.
 Missouri also expects to receive approximately $9.4 million for the ESG program, which will be administered by the Missouri Housing Development Commission. These funds can be used to help unsheltered homeless, sheltered homeless or those at risk of homelessness. They can also be used for eviction prevention assistance, including rapid rehousing, housing counseling and rental deposit assistance.
 In addition to these grants, there are several other ways Missourians can receive COVID-19 related housing assistance.
 Moratoriums and evictions
 Under the CARES Act, a moratorium on foreclosures for all federally-backed mortgages, including those covered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was put in place for 60 days starting March 18th.
 Under the bill, a borrower with a federally-backed mortgage experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19 may also request a forbearance for up to 180 days. The bill also instituted a moratorium on filings for evictions for renters in homes covered by a federally-backed mortgage for 120 days.
 Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP)
 The CARES Act provides $900 million in supplemental funding to LIHEAP to assist low-income families in paying their utility bills.
 At the state level, Parson’s administration worked with the investor-owned utility companies throughout Missouri to stop disconnects and shut-offs related to COVID-19, ensuring that Missourians would not have disruptions in utility services in the face of economic hardship.
 On April 1, the Missouri Supreme Court and several judicial circuits also announced they would suspend or postpone proceedings that include eviction or foreclosure cases until May 15, 2020.
 Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) Commissioner Margie Vandeven, Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development (DHEWD) Commissioner Zora Mulligan and Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance (DCI) Chlora Lindley-Myers gave updates on their respective departments.
 Department of Elementary and Secondary Education
 In addition to urging school leaders to think of safe ways to honor Missouri’s graduating seniors, DESE also issued guidance on summer school to school leaders last week. DESE states districts and charter schools are working to find the best solution they can for their students, families and staff members.
 DESE is also preparing to distribute millions of dollars from the CARES Act to local schools in the coming weeks.
 On Thursday, DESE submitted the final U.S. Department of Education paperwork necessary to receive the $208 million Missouri is getting from the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund. These funds will allow school leaders to address remote teaching and learning challenges and other important educational needs resulting from COVID-19.
 Missouri schools will also receive $117 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to reimburse schools for meals served during these extended closures. Schools have served more than 1.3 million meals across Missouri.
 Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development
 DHEWD states it continues to work with Parson and DESE to plan the distribution of federal funds through the CARES Act. The CARES Act provides approximately $30 billion to the US Department of Education (USDE) to disperse across several funds. Two of these provide funds related to higher education – the Higher Education Emergency Education Relief Fund (HERF) and the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund.
 HERF provides money institutions can use for COVID-19 relief. These funds flow directly from the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) to schools and must be used for costs that are related to significant changes to the delivery of instruction due to COVID-19. Missouri will also receive $54.6 million through GEER. These funds will allow the state to provide emergency support for K-12 schools and/or higher education institutions significantly impacted by COVID-19.
 DHEWD has also issued temporary guidance to students and counselors regarding state financial aid program eligibility due to school closures and changes in ACT test dates. This guidance addresses both A+ and Bright Flight scholarships.
 From a workforce development standpoint, DHEWD is working with other state agencies and private partners to ensure Missouri has the workforce it needs to respond to COVID-19, including the training of health care workers at alternate care sites and recruitment of contact tracers to help track and limit exposure to COVID-19.
 Missouri Job Centers and local workforce development boards are working to help Missourians skill up and get back to work. Job Centers offer reemployment services to those laid off due to COVID-19 and training assistance to those who qualify. These services include resume and interview preparation as well as assistance with job searching.
 Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance
 Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, DCI has worked closely with the Governor’s Office and others in state government to remove regulatory barriers allowing more individuals to work in Missouri and help address the health and welfare of Missourians.
 The Department has waived a historic 114 statutes or regulations for the 41 regulatory Boards in its Professional Registration Division alone. DCI has also filed or is in the process of filing five emergency rules related to COVID-19. These waivers have allowed the state to broaden the scope and number of healthcare workers who can provide services in Missouri.
 Additionally, DCI issued a bulletin enabling the issuance of temporary resident insurer producer licenses for the various lines of insurance business. These licenses assisted those looking for work in the industry but who were unable to complete the testing requirement as testing centers were closed due to stay at home and social distancing orders. To date, there have been more than 80 of these temporary licenses issued in Missouri.
 DCI has also issued several bulletins asking insurance carriers operating in Missouri to waive cost sharing for COVID-19 related testing, office visits, urgent care visits and emergency room visits and has encouraged the use of telehealth services to render care while still maintaining social distancing.

Last summer, this phone was introduced by Samsung, and Note 10 Plus is worth your account for a couple of factors even though many other choices have added since then. First off, it's the S Pen stylus, which permits you to draw or write the Note 10 Plus. Also, it can work for lining up the landscape shot or for taking selfies. The Notice 10 Plus is a monster that is a spec, using the Snapdragon 855 chip, 12GB of RAM, a mAh battery, and card service for storage. It's a massive 6.8-inch OLED screen that is fun to check at, functions with each US carrier, and it's IP68 dust and water resistance. It is not much it does not have.

The company posted a value of -$3.08 as earning-per-share over the last full year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -287.90%. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was -32.30% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 12.00% for the next five year.

Use up odds and ends such as off-cuts and peels of carrots, daikon, parsnip, onions, garlic peel, celery and mushrooms in bone stocks (my tip is to roast the bones first for a deeper flavour). These can be portioned out and kept frozen (250mls is my preferred size). If I don’t have quite enough to make a large pot, I save everything up in the freezer first until I do. Making stock can feel like a commitment – it is – but once you’ve finished washing that big pot and your freezer is well stocked up with the future potential of soups, curries, ragu and the like, you will feel an immense satiety.

I think, again, as I had mentioned to Craig earlier, I still think that we definitely have runway with respect to greater efficiencies, yields. Right? So again, if I were to look at the opportunities down the road I still believe that we probably have -- if you think about getting from 33% into the upper 30s, I would say probably I still think 35%, 40% of that will be driven by increase in efficiencies, with the other piece of it coming from volume. So, yes, I still, Dan, that we definitely have opportunities to continue to move up the gross margin from performance areas in the second half of the year.

The impact of these market dynamics on the Overstock Retail performance has been meaningful. This chart shows sales growth as compared to the year ago comparable periods. We've intentionally segmented the time periods to show organic operational improvements versus what I'll call stay-at-home mandate- related tailwinds. As you can see from the chart, we were already performing significantly better in the first quarter as compared to last year. We were already on track to outperform our first quarter plan before stay-at-home mandates began. From March 13 through the 31st, our sales grew in our signature categories as people began to focus on making their homes more functional during the national stay-at-home mandate.

Chapped lips are the opposite of sexy.
 Sure, upping your Chapstick game helps, but it's just one half of the equation.
 If you're starting this season off with flaked, dried-up lips there's no way that a lip balm alone (no matter how good it is) will cure you of your woes. To fix the real issue you've got start from scratch, and that means investing in an exfoliating lip scrub for the summer.  
 But don't worry, lip scrubs are beyond easy to use. In fact, it will only tack on an extra 20 seconds onto your routine.

Yes. And I guess to your second question was in relation to Johan Sverdrup in Phase 2, maybe I’ll take that one and the COVID-19 impact. As I said, so far, we have about 30% complete on Phase 2. And in actual fact, we are right on track, and we were almost kind of surprised that things went perhaps even better than we anticipated. And the – there’s been little disruption. Some of the yards are in Thailand, some in Norway, some in other parts of the world. But in general, we haven’t seen any disruptions. And for the time being, certainly, we remain – we maintain a target of fourth quarter 2022 for first oil. But right now, we don’t see any delay on Phase 2 or any impact on the COVID-19 situation.
