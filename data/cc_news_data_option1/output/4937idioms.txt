“People are acting like we lost 4-0,” Zubac said over Zoom, his comments coming in the Clippers’ first media availability since they introduced Tyronn Lue as their new head coach on Oct. 21. “We went to a seven-game series, we won the first three out of four. We played good enough, but at the end of the day we just couldn’t make shots when it mattered and that’s really what it was.

“We didn’t have it at the wrong time,” Zubac added. “Game 5, Game 6, Game 7, we started them out right, played three quarters right. Just, at the end of the day, it’s a make-or-miss league and we just didn’t make shots when we needed to.
