“We had several weeks left to go, in some cases more than a couple of months to go. So this was a body blow,” Mills said.
 Mills said many resorts generate 25% to 30% of their revenue from March through the end of the season, and the economic damage from the coronavirus is yet to be seen.
 “This is an unprecedented scenario for our industry, for the entire travel industry, for the entire country. And we’re trying to maintain optimism while we deal with some real significant consequences here in the short- and mid- term,” she said.
 Vail Resorts and rival Alterra Mountain Company have closed 49 of North America’s most well-known resorts, including Vail, Breckenridge and Steamboat. The move was an abrupt change of course after most of the country’s resorts vowed to stay open during the crisis while taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — In light of the coronavirus pandemic, Virginia's governor asked Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. on Wednesday to reconsider his decision to welcome students back to the Lynchburg campus this week after their spring break.
 Speaking at a news conference in Richmond, Gov. Ralph Northam criticized Liberty, which is among the nation's largest and most prominent evangelical colleges, as sending “mixed messages” about COVID-19, the illness that has crippled economies, forced restrictions on the movement of millions of people and swamped health care systems.
 As many colleges nationwide began announcing campus closures this month, Liberty initially planned to continue on-campus instruction. But last week, after Northam restricted gatherings of more than 100, Liberty said it would transition most classes online effective Monday.
 However, residential students were told they were “welcome” to return to campus, according to an email sent to students. The move was at odds with many other institutions of higher education, including the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, which has said only students who have “no other options” can remain on campus.
 “I would suggest that President Falwell look to the actions of the leaders of Virginia’s flagship universities for how to set a strong example in this health crisis and to please reconsider his message that invites and encourages students to return to campus," said Northam, who is a doctor.
 Liberty spokesman Scott Lamb told The Associated Press on Tuesday that about 1,100 residential students were back on campus.
 Lamb couldn't immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.
 The university has said it is working hard to comply with all state restrictions while providing safe and reliable accommodations for students, including extra sanitizing measures and changes to on-campus dining.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

The only difference that would be made at this point would be the writers and who they would be told to favor since like it or not, that's the true power behind the heroes and villains of the DC and Marvel universes. Who wins doesn't necessarily come down to whose abilities are greater, who's stronger, or who can blast the other person into oblivion. It's a combination of the writers, their marching orders, and the situation each character finds themselves in. With full power and defenses in place, Wonder Woman would surely take the fight to Thanos in a big way, but given the fact that Thanos has taken on god-level characters in the past and survived, Diana wouldn't stand much of a chance. She might have the weaponry, the shield, and the skills, but Thanos is every bit as skilled and worse, his mind never stops working as he would seek out every weakness of Diana's and attempt to exploit it since that's just the kind of villain he is, every bit as cerebral as he is visceral when it comes to breaking a person down. But again, with the Avengers on her side, Diana would have a better chance, and coming into the fight fresh and without having suffered a wound or two she could possibly take the fight to Thanos in a big way.

Amid the COVID-19 world we are currently living in, I have converted my walk- in closet into my home office. The only space I could find that would provide a corner of space in our home to block out the noise and bustle of having a household of six.
 That’s right, two adults, four kids ranging in age from 16 to one. Finding some solitude is paramount to keeping my sanity through this and also finding a place to decompress without having little eyes on me.
 The day the news broke that all schools would be shuttered until April 24 I was already preparing to work from home.
 I luckily work for a fantastic company that has spent an extreme amount of time and money to find ways for their associates to easily translate their work life into their home, so that part was easy.
 Move the computer, plug it in, and settle into my new office closet.
 What I wasn’t prepared for was adding on the job of educator.
 I had assumed that the school district would have procedures in place that would transition the missed days into distance learning with online access. That assumption was wrong.
 Both Wenatchee and Eastmont school districts have released information stating that they cannot transition this learning because of equity and accessibility barriers because not every student has access to technology and special programs.
 Through social media, I, like most people, have friends located all over the globe. Watching them post about live video classes that their kids are taking with their instructors and following daily assignments that are due and graded and not optional has me raising an eyebrow at our local response.
 You can’t tell me that we’re the only area that has equity and accessibility barriers. Others have figured it out, why can’t we?
 We are lucky to live in a state where some of the world’s smartest people live and operate companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing, and you’re telling me that we can’t come together somehow to find a way to get even a simple smartphone into the hands of these kids so that they can access an online classroom?
 As a community, we are coming out in full force to support our small businesses but we can’t come together to find a way to help our kids learn?
 My fear is that this closure could very well be extended through the end of the year. No return to school this year is a possibility. No distance-learning opportunities for these kids to stay on pace. And when you have a high- schooler who is getting ready to embark on Running Start and keep pace for graduation and beyond, they are going to be missing critical building blocks that will be tough to make up given time constraints.
 They simply can’t move onto the next math class or science class without learning what they were supposed to be taught from now until the end of the school year.
 So, for now, I’m trying to keep the peace. Explain with logic why I am asking them to read each day or complete practice tests for the SATs online. Like all things in parenting you hope that one day — it could be 20 years from now — they thank you for not letting them sit around and watch reruns of "The Office" and "Friends" all day.
 But right now, at this moment, I’m the worst.

The president has reunited his original band to publicize his heroic feats in protecting the public from the evil Chinese Virus: Commander Bonespur and the Stable Geniuses will hit the road to bring their message of narcissism, insecurity, and incompetence to the American heartland.

We'll turn again now to Dr. Jen Ashton here for more answers to your coronavirus questions. We got some great ones that are coming in from our viewers, Dr. Jen. We'll start with the first one, is there any correlation between blood type and whether or not you get the virus or how sick you become? That's a really interesting question. There was a limited study done very early on in this outbreak that showed that people who had type a blood were significantly at greater risk of getting sick with covid-19 than people with type O blood. Who were less likely. Now, it definitely needs more research. It hasn't been peer-reviewed. But if there's any truth to it, it does have implications for healthcare workers. It's not really for the lay public, but in terms of strategizing the risk of healthcare workers. Our second question, does the virus migrate once it's on the skin? The warning is to keep your hands away from your nose, mouth and eyes, but what if you touch your cheek or your forehead? So the virus doesn't crawl like some parasites do. But again, let's say it's on your cheek and you just brush your hand over your cheek and then two seconds later you touch your eye, or your nose or your mouth, that's how you can get infected. Again, the contact transmission the handwashing is really, really important. Once it's on your face it's easy to move it to a place where it can then again virulent. Our third question, does the latest pneumonia vaccination for seniors help with symptoms? Well, that new vaccine is really important for people over the age of 65, however, that does not protect you against this know -- novel coronavirus. What it may do is lower your risk of getting pneumonia from multiple pathogens. Remember, people who go to the hospital sick with pneumonia they can more than one type of pneumonia. Same with the flu. So, not a direct protection but still important nevertheless. All right, and Jen, we've been talking over the past few days about the nationwide blood shortage, and encouraging people that it's still safe to donate. But this next question is interesting, are people giving blood required to have a covid-19 test and await those results before donating? They are not, but the American red cross is taking really, really aggressive additional steps right now in the setting of the pandemic, so they're checking people's temperatures, there's no evidence that this covid-19 or novel coronavirus can be transmitted via blood but they're taking a lot of extra precautions and we desperately need more blood donations. So people if they're interested can go online and see what testing center is near them and register online. All right, that's great advice. I was just talking about this, because this time of year so many of us have allergies, and so our next question is, I get them every year seasonally, our next question, where we live, pollen and tree mold allergies are in in full swing, how can you tell if sneezing, coughing and sore throat are just allergies versus a case of covid-19? The first thing is, Amy, no one knows you better than you. If something feels bizarre to you, that's when your radar index of us is situation should go up, and start paying attention more closely. The other thing that is covid-19 really has such a massive range of symptoms, many people have such mild symptoms, they may have no symptoms so they don't know they're infected. The classic ones are easy to spot -- fever, cough, fatigue, some chest pain if it's severe in terms of respiratory issues, but the other common cold or allergy-like symptoms they can have them, too. That's why it all circles back to testing. We need to be able to test so many people so we get a grip. You can have two things at the same time. You can have allergies and coronavirus. I'm curious, do we even know the answer to this, why is it so different from person to person? We don't know because, again, there's so much about this virus that we're still learning, it's not even three months old yet, in general, we see that with influenza, not everyone gets massively ill and bedridden for seven to ten days with the flu, some people have more mild symptoms, so there's always a spectrum of the virus and we're seeing a huge one with this one for sure. All right, and speaking of tests, our next question surrounds that, do the tests have to be taken up your nose or are there other ways? The good news is that there are other ways that we will be seeing very, very soon, in days to weeks, but right now, the only test that's widely in circulation is a nasal swab and Amy, it needs to go all the way back there. So it's pretty uncomfortable. But you're going to be seeing self- swabbing in the nose. Sometimes in the hospital they do an oral swab down the throat, which causes people to cough and gag. We'll be seeing finger pricks and eventually blood tests, serology, to see if we have antibodies against this. A lot of options in the realm of testing. Over the next couple weeks? Hopefully, as soon as the fda approves these other methods we need to see them, as we say in medicine, stat. All right, Dr. Jen, as always, thank you so much. If you have your questions for Dr. Ashton, send them to her Instagram, @drjashton. Much more ahead as we

The high-value cargoes will stay with air but [for high-demand cargoes] premium ocean services are reliable and you can do weekly departures to get your goods every seven days or multiple services to get your goods in even fewer days.

MARSHFIELD -- Lou Merloni's professional resume resembles his reputation as a multi-dimensional baseball player who could fill in at any number of spots on the diamond.
 Besides being a baseball analyst on television as well as the co-host of a weekday sports talk show on WEEI, the 48-year-old Marshfield resident can now add part-time psychiatrist to his growing list of skills.
 "We are in some challenging and scary times right now and I hope we can give our listeners a little release from what's going on in the world," Merloni said as everyone comes to grips with the growing Coronavirus pandemic. "Hopefully we can give people a couple of hours of solid entertainment during the day."
 Merloni, who was born in Framingham, joins Glenn Ordway and Christian Fauria each weekday from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on 'EEI to go over the day's top sports stories. But with the edicts to emphasize social distancing as we try to go about our daily lives with the COVID-19 outbreak happening, they are no longer in the same studio for the time being. Ordway and Fauria are broadcasting from their home studios while Merloni makes the trip from Marshfield to the Brighton studio each weekday.
 "It's a little different, but right now it's something that's necessary," Merloni said about separating the trio. "We all have Ipad's to see each other during the show, so technology helps us pull it all together each day."
 Ordway, Merloni and Fauria have been together for a few years now and each of them continues to refine their roles with the show.
 "I think we've all learned to be thick-skinned and we can all give each other crap when we need to. It's all part of the entertainment of the show," Merloni said. "It would be boring radio if we all agreed on every subject, every day. I don't think people would want to listen to that."
 Merloni was an MLB player during the 9-11 terrorist attacks and was working in radio when the Boston Marathon bombings occurred in 2013, both times when sports took a backseat to the real world. But, he said, this time feels different.
 "The big difference with the Boston Marathon bombings was people were just angry. They were much angrier than we are right now. They were mad that someone came into their city and committed such a horrible act," Merloni said. "I think right now it's more a fear of the unknown that everyone is feeling. It's a scary time for all of us."
 Merloni spent 15 years playing professional baseball, including two stints each with Cleveland and Boston. He also played with the San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Angels organizations and spent a portion of one season in the Japanese League.
 A solid infielder who played second and third base as well as shortstop, Merloni was a career .271 hitter in 423 major league games and saw his most action in 2002 when he batted .247 in 84 games with Boston. He spent part of his time with the Red Sox traveling between Triple-A affiliate Pawtucket and Boston.
 "It did get frustrating at times, but I know it made me stronger as a person," Merloni said about the trips back to the minor leagues. "The thing I was proud of is when I was sent down I always came back and I never had an attitude about it. I always went down to the minors with the attitude that I was going to work hard and earn my way back."
 Merloni called it a career in 2007 after playing 110 games with Sacramento, the AAA affiliate of the Oakland A's. He went out a winner as the River Cats captured the Pacific Coast League title at the end of a season that Merloni knew would be his last.
 "I was planning for what my next step would be that final year," Merloni said. "I thought about getting into coaching, but I knew what kind of life that was and I didn't think it was for me. Coaches put in so many hours, both in-season and off-season, and that's what makes it such a tough commitment. I got married the fall after I retired and wanted to start a family."
 So after a career of dealing with the media, Merloni switched sides and became one of them.
 "I never thought about becoming a part of the media as a player, but when I retired that door was opened for me. Glenn (Ordway) had me on his show a few times and I started doing a little television work with NESN (covering the Red Sox) and it blossomed from there," Merloni said.
 Despite his connections with the Red Sox, Merloni has been known to be critical of the team at times.
 "It can be difficult going into the locker room after I've said something on the air about the team, but as long as I am fair with my criticism I can take it," Merloni said. "I just try to communicate the things that I see and that I hear. That's part of my job."
 Growing up as a fan of all Boston sports, Merloni said he shares the passion of the common sports fan. He believes the thing that separates Boston from the other places he's traveled is the number of fans following the team.
 "There are passionate fans everywhere, but the sheer number of them is what makes Boston a special place to be a sports fan," Merloni said. "In some places I played there were two or three newspapers or media members that covered the team regularly but that's not the way it is in Boston. There's a lot more media members around the team each day."
 Many of those media members have also been following the final divorce between Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. The end officially came Friday when Brady signed a two-year, $50 million dollar deal to join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
 "I always thought he was going to leave, but even now it's official, it still doesn't feel real that he's moving on," Merloni said. "After 20 years it's over just like that. That's going to take a while to sink in, but I'm excited to see what's next."

Last week, a barrier was placed at the base of the Manitou Incline, the region's busiest trail that Manitou's City Council deemed a health hazard. Near Denver, the popular Waterton Canyon recreation area has been closed. And across America, gates have come down at national parks, including Rocky Mountain National Park.
 At least one Colorado Springs city councilman says local preserves should follow suit.
 "Close the parks until we can get enough test kits to find out who is in fact carrying the virus," Bill Murray said in an interview Wednesday. "All I'm asking is to buy us some time to get our act together."
 While the mayor has so far decided against a stay-at-home measure of the sort ordered by Denver's mayor, Murray has been critical of Suthers, saying: "We are basically watching a Category 5 storm approach us with nobody taking protective measures."
 And while parks have stayed open amid shelter-in-place orders elsewhere — recreation sites remain open during Boulder's lockdown — Murray suggested the Springs was in a unique position with its broad, bustling base of trail users.
 "We may get to the point where we may allow only certain parks to be open," City Council President Richard Skorman said in a phone call, while strolling a meadow near his home. "But for now, it's probably something that's keeping our population from mental health issues."
 In a letter from the Trails and Open Space Coalition (TOSC) and signed by several other local recreation and conservation groups, city officials have been urged to leave parks and trails open.
 "Closing them would be another blow to our communities' collective sprit in coping with this crisis," the letter read.
 TOSC Executive Director Susan Davies encouraged people to visit the nonprofit's website, where lesser-known getaways are spotlighted as part of the group's "Get Out Spread Out" campaign.
 "We're trying to give people choices, other options," Davies said. "Because we know people need to get out."
 The decision makers know, too, said Kurt Schroeder, the city parks department's maintenance and operations manager. Wednesday afternoon, he said the department has not discussed the possibility of limiting or cutting off access.
 "Not yet," he said, "and we're hoping we won't have to."

Airline service in the United States is teetering on the brink of collapse, with near-empty planes and coronavirus outbreaks that have left some air traffic control towers empty.
 Even with sharply reduced schedules, airlines are consolidating some of the remaining flights because passengers aren’t showing up.

The Anjuman Auqaf in a statement asked the people to offer prayers at home to contain spread of coronavirus,the Anjuman has already suspended all congregational prayers at Jama Masjid Srinagar for the time being, Kashmir Media Service reported. The statement said as the world battles Covid-19, Muslim communities around the globe are also carefully considering how best to continue with the religious activities while trying to minimise spread of the coronavirus. “With the increasing rate of transmission, number of deaths, and limited medical facilities available, all Islamic scholarly and medical advice points towards the curtailment of social contact as the key towards reducing the spread,” it said. “Hence, it is our public duty as Muslims to protect one another from harm, and it is evident the most effective way to do this now is to avoid social contact as much as possible. This includes in all walks of life, whether social, work or the mosques. It has become imperative that this extraordinary step is taken to ensure the safety and well being of all as is being done in many Muslim countries,” it maintained. Anjum Auqaf on behalf of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who continues to be under house arrest, requests people to undertake these measures needed in such unprecedented times and put trust in Allah and His mercy and pray for the safety and protection of mankind in this grave crisis, the statement added. Meanwhile, Mufti Nasir-ul-Islam in his message said, as events are unfolding, extremely grim and difficult situation expected, handful of ventilators, inefficient testing facilities and over-burdened medical staff are the biggest concern in occupied Kashmir. “Keeping this in view, I request Imams and Muazins to offer obligatoy prayers with association of two

Espalier is a way of training and pruning plants so their branches lie in an orderly and ornamental two-dimensional form. The beauty comes from the tracery of the branches. Espalier is a way to create a living border in a garden, or decorate a fence or wall.
 Hang fruit on those branches and you have a plant offering superb flavor as well as beauty. The reason for that good flavor is that the espalier form allows leaves and fruits to bathe in light and air.
 Espaliers have a long tradition in northern Europe, and have mostly been applied to apples and pears. Here in North America, our climates and day lengths are quite different, and so attempts at espalier here often fall short of expectations. Sure, you can bend branches in all sorts of designs, but they won't be thoroughly clothed in the requisite flowers and then fruits.

Other stops might have included the third-floor Gray W Legends dining hall, where a personal chef prepares restaurant-quality meals for players throughout the season, or the 160-seat auditorium, lined with leather gray chairs that double as school desks.
 For this particular prospect, getting a full tour of the 75,000-square-foot, $61 million facility in Pullman, and Martin Stadium, was as simple as pulling out an iPhone and making a FaceTime call.
 "It's as good as we can provide right now for kind of a virtual tour in substitution for the usual on-campus visits you get this kind of year," Rolovich said.
 It's anyone's guess when prospects will be able to visit college campuses again, with a mandatory recruiting dead period in place and travel restrictions potentially next on the list. Showing the future generation of Cougars where they might be playing their college football through the frame of a 6-by-3-inch phone screen is an example of how Rolovich is making the most of his resources.
 Granted, it still leaves the Cougars at a disadvantage, he believes.
 "Washington State is a place, I think, you've got to get on campus and see this place and then feel it," Rolovich said. "I think it's a positive for us in recruiting. I think it was trending the right direction ... you've got to be ready to adjust quickly when this thing opens back up."
 Rolovich would've had his first look at the current Cougars in a practice setting Friday, when WSU was originally scheduled to begin spring camp. That start date was pushed back to April 2, although as other Pac-12 schools like Washington and Oregon have canceled their spring scrimmages, it's reasonable to think the Cougars might not hold their first official practice under their new coach until August.
 "I think most people would say it would not be advantageous for a first-year coach," Rolovich said, on potentially forfeiting spring football. "But it just is what it is. There's probably some teams that, a lot of their guys have an idea about their offense and defense, and I've got to give our team a lot of credit. They've come up and they're eager to get comfortable with the new scheme. So I think how they are wired and how they are built has put us in a better place whenever football returns."
 Until that happens, Rolovich and his assistant coaches will rely on alternate means of communication with players, and find other ways to immerse them in new schemes -- on offense and defense.
 "Distance football learning" might not necessarily encompass extended FaceTime meetings in which coaches spend hours sketching out Xs and Os. Presenting information in shorter, daily 10- to 15-minute chats might be more feasible.
 "There's plenty of technology to get some done," Rolovich said. "I'm hesitant to think we can get the whole playbook and the whole schematic identity in over the airwaves. There has to be a point where we can get on the field, and I don't want to stack knowledge on top of bad foundations. ... And with them not being able to make the physical mistakes in practice and get coached on it, I don't want to just assume we can go through the installs in two weeks on Zoom and feel like we're ready to go play."
 If the COVID-19 pandemic bleeds into the summer, it could also push back the date when players are scheduled to return to campus. Before practicing 25 times in August, the Cougars take advantage of a summer strength and conditioning program that allows them to get in shape. If the strength program is truncated, it could restrict or limit what the Cougars can do during camp.
 "You'd need a good four to six weeks to make sure their bodies are ready for training camp," Rolovich said. "Us as coaches need to be prepared to adjust knowing that. Maybe we need to take it easy a little bit, maybe we don't need to scrimmage as much. I don't know."
 Rolovich's priority is ensuring every player has adequately adjusted to the online distance learning system the university implemented Monday as students finished spring break. Trying to control the uncontrollable, he figures, is simply wasted energy.
 "Right now it's like, 'What do you hear, what do you hear?' 'Oh, I'm hearing this' " he said. "I'd rather go hang out with my family and play Chutes and Ladders than talk about what might happen. I just think when it's our turn to know what's going to happen, they're going to tell us."

Production workers at a Southwestern Ontario cannabis company could be the first in Canada's marijuana industry to unionize, a move one union official hopes will create a "ripple effect" across the sector.
 Employees at WeedMD, a London-headquartered company with more than 200 workers at its operations in Strathroy, Aylmer and Bowmanville, have been signing union cards with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union over the past three weeks, national representative Kevin Shimmin said Wednesday.
 Representing 250,000 workers across Canada, UFCW wants to begin negotiating a contract with the company next week, Shimmin said.
 "We're hoping that with enough public attention, the people who are consuming cannabis, both medicinally and recreationally, are looking for an ethical employer," he said.
 "We're hoping that enough public pressure will come to bear on this company and they will sit down and start bargaining."
 The union drive has huge significance across Canada, where more than 10,000 people are employed in the cannabis industry. That includes more than 2,000 in Southwestern Ontario, a region that has carved out a niche as a cannabis belt because of its proximity to 400-series highways, its embrace of the sector and an abundance of labour and farmland.
 "This is a long time coming," Ian Dawkins, a Vancouver-based cannabis consultant, said of the WeedMD unionization effort, calling it a sign the marijuana sector is maturing.
 "The needs of workers and the strains on them are going to continue to worsen, until we figure out formal way of dealing with (the problems) like we do in other industries."
 Shimmin said the push to unionize started earlier this month when workers reached out to UFCW, prompting the union to start recording employee concerns and signing members.
 Staffers aired grievances about health and safety issues, including elevated carbon monoxide levels in grow rooms, pesticides being sprayed on plants while workers were present, too many workers packed in rooms and a staffer fired for helping organize the union drive, said Shimmin, who wouldn't disclose how many workers have signed up.
 A WeedMD spokesperson said the company supports its workers' right to organize but denies all of the union's claims.
 "We've reviewed some of the allegations that they're making and these allegations are baseless, without merit," Marianella delaBarrera said.
 "While we cannot comment on specific internal employee matters, we can say that we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously," delaBarrera said, noting WeedMD is in full compliance with all federal and provincial regulations.
 The company was nominated by its staff for a local business magazine's 2020 best employer award, which the company won, Delabarrera added.
 Cannabis production workers in Ontario are considered agricultural employees and fall under the provincial Agricultural Employees Protection Act, legislation that the UFCW claims violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by failing to protect the right of freedom of association rights for workers. The act sets out a different process for unionizing workers than the route laid out in other Ontario labour law.
 "It's a very weak piece of legislation," Shimmin said.
 UFCW has bargained union contracts for cannabis workers in California, Oregon, Colorado, Washington, Minnesota and New Mexico. Last year, it unionized and ratified a collective agreement for call centre workers at the Ontario Cannabis Store, the government-run marijuana wholesaler and delivery service.
 Shimmin said he's hopeful the WeedMD union drive will lead to a push by others in the industry to follow suit.
 "We've signed cards with other production workers at other facilities in Ontario, but we haven’t gotten to this point (of seeking bargaining dates)," he said. "So we're hoping this causes a ripple effect, so that it would show workers that, yes, indeed it is possible to get unionized."

Coronavirus delivers ‘body blow’ to Colorado’s ski industry


--DocBreak--
Ski resorts across the West that were shut down amid coronavirus fears are grappling with an economic “body blow” at a time when they normally would be welcoming hordes of spring break revelers.
 March is usually one of the busiest months for Colorado resorts, which tallied a record 13.8 million skier visits last winter and typically contribute between $5 billion and $6 billion annually to the economy. But on Tuesday, the chair lifts at Vail swayed silently in the breeze, and the resort’s typically bustling base village was all but empty.
 “Today it’s desolate. It’s a ghost town,” aid Colin Tabb, a Vail resident and snowboarder. “Usually we are fighting lift lines and we are doing our thing still, but it’s a complete ghost town.”
