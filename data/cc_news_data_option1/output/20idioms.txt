One of the big changes was transmitting the election results in to the county clerk's office instead of having the township clerks drive them in immediately after they were tallied.

Castro, 45, was among the youngest in the running at a moment when the party’s ascendant left wing is demanding generational change. And as the grandson of a Mexican immigrant, Castro said he recognized the meaning of his candidacy in the face of President Donald Trump’s inflammatory anti-immigrant rhetoric and hardline policies on the U.S.-Mexico border.But he labored not to be pigeonholed as a single-issue candidate. Castro made the attention-getting choice of Puerto Rico as his first campaign stop, recited the names of black victims killed in high-profile police shootings and was the first in the field to call for Trump’s impeachment.But his sagging poll numbers never budged. He was often eclipsed by another Texan in the race who dropped out this fall, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, and another young former mayor, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend. His campaign and supporters, meanwhile, grumbled that Castro didn’t get due credit for taking out-front positions.Trying to show he could go to-to-toe with Trump, Castro swung for big moments on debate stages, and flirted with a much-needed breakout in June after confronting O’Rourke over not supporting decriminalization of illegal border crossings.But turning his sights on Biden on a later stage brought swift backlash. During the September debate in Houston, Castro appeared to touch on concerns about the age of the then-76-year-old former vice president and added a parting shot at him.“I’m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you’re not,” Castro said.Castro — who was Obama’s housing secretary in his second term — denied taking a personal dig at Biden as others in the field condemned the exchange. Three days later, Castro lost one of his three backers in Congress, Rep. Vicente González of Texas, who switched his endorsement to Biden.Castro had warned supporters in a fundraising appeal that failing to make the November debate stage would spell the end of his campaign. He needed to hit at least 3% polling in four early state or national polls but didn’t get even one.What is next for Castro is unclear. Back home in Texas, Democrats had long viewed Castro as their biggest star in waiting and some have urged him to run for governor as the state trends more diverse and liberal.Castro was pegged as a rising Democratic star after being elected as mayor of the nation’s seventh- largest city at age 34, and he was on the short list for Hillary Clinton’s running mate in 2016. But he swatted away suggestions on the campaign trail this time around that he was auditioning for that role again.___Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City police officer convicted of breaking into a home during a drunken bachelor party in Nashville, Tennessee, has quit the force. Michael Reynolds stepped down rather than face disciplinary proceedings, said Devora Kaye, a department spokeswoman. Reynolds, who had patrolled Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood, will receive no pension or health benefits and will not be allowed to carry a firearm. “His actions are wholly inconsistent with the values and standards the New York City Police Department expects and demands of its officers,” Kaye said in a statement. News of Reynolds' departure came a day after protesters gathered outside the department to call for his firing. Reynolds last month was sentenced to 15 days in jail after pleading no contest to aggravated criminal trespass and three counts of assault in the July 2018 home invasion. Reynolds admitted breaking into a woman's home he drunkenly mistook for the Airbnb rental in which he was staying. He also admitted using a racial slur during the incident. “I'm absolutely sorry I said that word,\" Reynolds said during his sentencing hearing, according to a transcript of the proceeding. “I had no intention of getting that intoxicated that night. If I could take it back, I definitely would have never came to that bachelor party.” Prosecutors said the woman had been home with her four sons at the time of the break-in.

DALLAS (AP) — There was the 1-7-1 start for the Dallas Stars, who had such high expectations after an impressive playoff run last season. When they started consistently winning again, there was the shocking coaching change unrelated to anything on the ice. Dallas then opened 2020 with another comeback victory on New Year's Day, outdoors at Cotton Bowl Stadium before 85,630 fans — the second-largest crowd ever to see an NHL game. “Forty-one games, and it seems like we've been through 100,” center Andrew Cogliano said. This has already been an eventful regular season for the Stars, and they are only halfway done. Through it all, the Stars (23-14-4, 50 points) are third in the Western Conference standings after the 4-2 win over the Nashville Predators in the Winter Classic. It was the third win in a row for Dallas, which came from behind in the third period in each of those games. “Our team still hasn't even shown our true potential. Lately, especially after the coach change, we've been very inconsistent and all over the map, and trying to put our identity back together,” center Jason Dickinson said. “So I think we're on our way there, and we've still got half a season to go. It's about time for us to really hone in on that stuff.” Dallas will be back inside, at home in the American Airlines Center, to start the second half of its 82-game regular- season schedule Friday night against Detroit. The Stars are 6-3-1 since second-year head coach Jim Montgomery was fired Dec. 10 for unspecified unprofessional conduct. They beat New Jersey 2-0 that night when Rick Bowness, in his second season in Dallas, took over as interim head coach for the rest of the season. Bowness has coached in more NHL games than anyone — 2,238 overall, 473 as a head coach — and in...

BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Thousands of women are thrown into the fight of their life against a cancer diagnosis. For many, treatment includes the removal of one breast or both.Pan Duby beat cancer, but she didn’t feel normal. A 3D tattoo artist and registered nurse, Christin Dottolo, helped change that with a simple, but meaningful tattoo.After working as a registered nurse for 15 years and six years as a surgery nurse, Dottolo found a new meaning.She worked with women battling a breast cancer diagnosis from the beginning of the process to the end. “They would come in, get a mastectomy, later on, come back do reconstruction,” she said.Though helpful in the cancer treatment process, some lifesaving surgeries to remove breasts leave women with scars instead of nipples and areolas.One day after a reconstruction surgery, Dottolo asked a surgeon what are possible next steps for women are to feel normal again.That’s when she found out about the medical tattoo industry.Dottolo started training, shadowed trained professionals and went back to school to learn how to complete a 3D tattoo of the nipple and areola for breast cancer survivors.Dottolo founded Medical Ink and had her first patient was mid-2017.She and Duby met in April 2019. Several months after Duby was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, she had a double mastectomy followed by reconstruction surgery.“I was diagnosed at the beginning of July (2018). Beginning of August, I was having surgery,” Duby said.Both of Duby’s breasts were removed to treat her diagnosis, leaving her with scars in place of her nipples and areolas.“The reconstructed breast is kind of like a blank canvas and really all you see at that point is the scars,” Dottolo said.Dottolo scrubbed into countless surgeries, aiding doctors as they remove cancerous tissue from patients. She had no idea after years of nursing, she’d be tattooing. "But when it hit me that this what I wanted to do; I knew this is where I’m supposed to be,” she said.The 3D tattoo artist said she wanted to use her empathy for patients to be on the healing side of cancer.“We go through so much with part of your body removed and gone; you want to feel as normal as you possibly can,” Duby said.Although it’s not like your average tattoo. Dottolo said it can’t be implanted and the needle can’t go very deep into the skin. “It has to be very shallow; she said. “It’s a very surface tattoo. It can fade over time.”That means patients have to touch it up every once in a while. Dottolo said every five to seven years. But if patients want to come in sooner, that’s no problem.That’s still thinking on the bright side for Duby. “It’s life. You can either take it with a grain of salt or you can beat it.”Because she beat cancer and she’s now she’s making the choices in her life. “I’m a competitor. I don’t want to lose. I’m going to beat it so here we are.”Copyright 2020 WAFB. All rights reserved.

The New England Patriots are wobbling into the postseason as opposed to arriving in their typical stellar form. A lackluster December cost the Patriots a first-round bye, and they will be competing in the AFC wild- card round for the first time since the 2009 season when they host the Tennessee Titans on Saturday night in Foxborough, Mass.Third-seeded New England 12-4 lost three of five in December, including a stunning 27-24 setback to the Miami Dolphins on Sunday to assure there would be no bye. The late-season struggles have erased the Patriots from being mentioned among the Super Bowl favorites. Running back James White is aware of that perception but says the focus has to be solely on the sixth-seeded Titans 9-7.We all didnt play our best football last week, and we all obviously wanted to play better but we didnt, White said during a Tuesday press conference. Cant sulk on that. Its a playoff game here, you play to play in these games right here. Were all excited to get back out there. Tennessee landed a playoff berth on Sunday with a 35-14 victory over the Houston Texans, who rested quarterback Deshaun Watson and other key players. It is the Titans second postseason berth in the past three seasons.Running back Derrick Henry will certainly get a lot of work after rushing for an NFL-best 1,540 yards in addition to scoring 18 touchdowns 16 rushing, two receiving. But the player most under the microscope is quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who will see action in his first career postseason game. Tannehill was superb after replacing Marcus Mariota as the starting quarterback following Week 6. Overall, the 31-year-old passed for 2,742 yards and 22 touchdowns against six interceptions while completing a franchise- record 70.3 percent of his passes and averaging an NFL-best 9.6 yards per attempt.Its obviously a big opportunity for us, a huge challenge on the road, Tannehill told reporters. I always wanted to be playing in January and competing for a championship. It is the playoffs, and everything amps up a little bit. ... I definitely expect it to be an intense game.Patriots quarterback Tom Brady hasnt looked so super during his age-42 season. He completed just 60.8 percent of his passes -- tying for the third-lowest ratio of his career -- while passing for 4,057 yards, 24 touchdowns and eight interceptions. There is a lot of chatter that Bradys passing elbow is ailing, but he continues to insist that all is well with his right arm.Its feeling good. I dont have any problem, Brady said on his weekly radio show. I have no injuries. Ive said it, like, a lot. I feel good. Theres no injury, no nothing. I wish I wouldve played better, and thats about it. Even with the rumblings, New England ranks seventh in the NFL in scoring offense at 26.2 points per game. The passing attack ranks eighth 247.6 yards per game, and standout receiver Julian Edelman has 100 catches for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns.The Titans rank 24th against the pass 255.0 yards per game and 21st in total defense 359.5 yards per game but will get cornerback Adoree Jackson back. He missed the past four games with a foot injury. Tennessees defense includes solid playmakers in linebacker Harold Landry team-best nine sacks and safety Kevin Byard five interceptions.The Patriots have two players with five or more picks. Stephon Gilmore tied for the NFL lead with six interceptions while safety Devin McCourty had five. Linebacker Jamie Collins had a team-high seven sacks for a unit that led the NFL in scoring defense 14.1-point average and total defense 275.9 yards per game and ranks second in passing defense 180.4 yards per game.The matchup is the first in postseason play between Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel and Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Vrabel, a former linebacker for New England who was part of three Super Bowl titles, guided the Titans to a 34-10 rout of his former mentor in a regular-season game in 2018. Of course, the stage is significantly bigger on Saturday. And Vrabel says there is no advantage to having inside knowledge on how Belichick thinks and prepares.Theres a fine line between just going ahead and changing a bunch of stuff and thinking, Well, theyre going to do this, so we cant do that, Vrabel said. ... So Bill will prepare his team like he does, and Ill do the best job to get our guys ready to play. --Field Level Media

For film fans, a new year means awards season approaches. Oscar Nominations will be announced on January 13 before the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles hosts the 92nd academy awards on February 9. PAUL STEWARD predicts the runners and riders in the six main categories and says who has the best chance of winning a golden statuette.Best supporting Actress Laura Dern is currently the hot favourite to nab the best supporting actress Oscar, for her portrayal of steely divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw in the Netflix produced Marriage Story. Her competition comes in the unlikely form of popstar\/actress Jennifer Lopez who gained rave reviews for her turn as a lap dancer turning the tables on her Wall Street clients in Hustlers. The Boxing Day release of Greta Gerwig's Little Women throws up a lot of actresses who could potentially end up in this category, with the excellent Florence Pugh, perhaps the most likely, while Margot Robbie could also be in the running for her role in the yet to be released Bombshell, where she stars alongside Nicole Kidman and Charlize Theron as Fox News anchors taking on the toxic male atmosphere at their station. Other names not to be discounted include Annette Benning for the Report, and Thomasin McKenzie for JoJo Rabitt. Top Pick - Laura Dern Outside Bet - Florence PughBest Supporting Actor The performances in Martin Scorsese's gangster epic The Irishman are certain to gain attention in the best supporting actor category, with both Al Pacino and Joe Pesci delivering some of their best work for years. Three time nominee Brad Pitt also stands a good chance of nabbing his first acting Oscar for his portrayal of stuntman Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. While rumours abound that Tom Hanks may run in the best supporting category for his charming turn as Ted Rogers in the film 'A Beautiful day in the Neighbourhood'. Other names in the running include Willem Dafoe for the Lighthouse, Anthony Hopkins for his portrayal of Pope Benedict in Netflix film The Two Popes and Jamie Foxx for legal drama Just Mercy. Top Pick - Joe Pesci Outside Bet - Brad PittBest Actress Rene Zellweger's portrayal of Judy Garland in the American entertainers biopic has many tipping her for the best actress Oscar, however she will face stiff competition from Scarlett Johansson for her emotional performance in Marriage Story. Luptia Nyong'o's stunning dual performance as doppelgangers Adelaide and Red in Jordan Peele's Us is undoubtedly deserving of recognition, whilst outsider Cynthia Erivo has been gradually gaining support for her role in Harriet, the life story of American Abolitionist Harriet Tubman. Charlize Theron for Bombshell and Awkwafina for the Farewell are also very likely to be in the running. Top Pick - Rene Zellweger Outside Bet - Lupita Nyong'oBest Actor Three time nominee Joaquin Phoenix looks to secure his first Academy award for his transformative performance in Todd Phillips DC origin film Joker and is currently the bookies favourite. Meanwhile Phoenix's co-star Robert De Niro is also tipped to be in the running for his portrayal of hit man Frank Sheehan in Martin Scorsese's The Irishman. Others likely to be considered are Antonio Banderas for Pain and Glory, Adam Driver for his turn opposite Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story and Leonardo DiCaprio for his leading role in Once upon a time in Hollywood. Whilst a late contender comes in the unlikely form of comedian Adam Sandler, who is receiving rave reviews for his performance in crime drama Uncut Gems. Top Pick - Joaquin Phoenix Outside Bet - Adam DriverBest Director Two of Hollywoods most acclaimed filmmakers, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino, go head to head in the race for the best director prize. Scorsese for his decade spanning gangster epic The Irishman which has been hailed in some quarters as his late career masterpiece, and Tarantino for the beautifully crafted love letter to the 1960's Once upon a time in Hollywood. Tarantino has won two Oscars before in the Original Screenplay category but never walked away with the directors prize. Something that is perhaps long overdue. The Newly knighted Sir Sam Mendes will also be looking to add to his accolades for his World War One drama 1917, which is due to be released in mid January. Parasite, Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho's follow-up to Snowpiercer and Okja is also not yet released in the UK but is creating quite the buzz stateside, giving him an outside chance, whilst Greta Gerwig's take on the literary classic Little Women could also see her feature in the running. Top Pick - Quentin Tarantino Outside Bet - Greta GerwigBest Picture In the past the Oscar for Best picture and Best Director usually went hand in hand, however since 2010 when the preferential voting system for best picture was reintroduced it has become much more divided. This year the field is wide open for the academy's most coveted prize. Jay Roach's Bombshell seems to be the current front runner, followed closely by Bong Joon Ho's Parasite, and Todd Phillips excellent Joker. However the aforementioned Once upon a Time in Hollywood, The Irishman and Little Women also stand a very good chance. Lulu Wang's The Farewell, Marriage Story, 1917, and Taika Waititi's Anti hate satire JoJo Rabbit are all also likely to be considered worthy of votes, making this category the hardest to predict. Top Pick - 1917 Outside Bet - Once upon a time in Hollywood

Will Varun Dhawan tie the knot with girlfriend Natasha Dalal? Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt actually get married this year?

If 2018 saw the weddings of Priyanka-Nick, Ranveer-Deepika and Sonam Kapoor-Anand Ahuja, then 2019 has been the year when rumours of romances sustained the gossip vine. Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor made their relationship public, while Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar’s love grew stronger. Will 2020 see some power shaadis?

WHITE RIVER TOWNSHIP, Mich. (WOOD/CNN) - A home on Lake Michigan is a total loss after it crashed off the top of a bluff on New Year’s Eve. Aggressive erosion along the lake caused the collapse. Despite the owner's best efforts to combat the rising waters and aggressive erosion, Mother Nature won the day.“I got a message that I never expected to get because we’d been working so hard, and it looked like it was going to work out, and he said, ‘She went over,’” homeowner Tish Gancer said.She said the beloved cottage had been in her family for generations, dating back to the 1930s."I have lots of friends and I am, we have lots of people love it enjoy it And it's been a beautiful wonderful blessing to all of us."The landscape has changed dramatically since she was a little girl, Gancer said."Oh my gosh, you could not see the sunset or the lake from the cottage. There was woods there," she said.She shared a photo from 2012, showing just how much has changed - and disappeared - since then.Although Gancer doesn't live at the cottage full time, lately, they'd been working around the clock to protect their home from falling in. They're grateful no one was around or hurt when it did.“I kept thinking it was going to work, but it really sped up there in the last couple weeks,” she said.Muskegon County officials said they’d been monitoring the home and said the homeowner was in the process of preventing this kind of damage by installing a rock wall.Sadly, they were mid-project when it all came crashing in.Gancer knows it's all the responsibility is on her, the state saying there's little to nothing they can do to help, and she accepts that.Her only message to others living along the lakeshore is to act quickly before it’s too late.Erosion is a threat to many properties around Lake Michigan. Two homes were demolished last year before they fell into the water. Another was moved away from the lake.Copyright 2020 WOOD via CNN. All rights reserved.

Sözer, ''Beşiktaş'ın tasarruf senesinde kadın basketbol takımını ligden çekme kararı aldık. Erkek takımımız bu sezon THY Avrupa Ligi'nde oynayacak. İddialı bir kadro yaptık. Geçen seneye göre çok daha iyi bir kadro oldu. Kız takımına harcayacağımız rakam yetmeyecek. Beşiktaş'ın tasarruf senesinde bunu düşündük. Geçen senelerde plan bütçe yapılmadığı için bu duruma gelindi. Oyuncuların da zor durumda kalmasını istemedik. Oyuncuların maaşlarını ödeyemediğiniz zaman da kulübün borcu artıyor. Biz Beşiktaş'ı düzlüğe çıkarmakta inançlıyız. Beşiktaş'ı bu durumdan kurtarmak için geldik'' şeklinde ifadeler kullandı.

Grant Delpit has had an unusual season. LSU's star safety switched positions early in the year to compensate for an injured teammate. Later in the season, he was the injured player and the Tigers' defense suffered from Delpit being limited by a sore ankle. That didn't stop Delpit from winning the Thorpe Award as the nation's top defensive back or keep No. 1 LSU (14-0) from reaching the College Football Playoff with a perfect record. In a case of fortuitous timing for the Tigers, Delpit heads into the national championship game against No. 3 Clemson (14-0) on Jan. 13 in New Orleans feeling healthy and playing about as well as he has all season. No coincidence, the same goes for LSU's defense across the board. “He was being tough all year and battling through injuries, and he got healthy towards the end of the year, and that was kind of the turning point of our defense,” LSU quarterback Joe Burrow said Thursday. “I think that just shows how important he is.\" Delpit's season took a turn after teammate Todd Harris was lost for the year with a right knee injury in the third game of the season against Northwestern State. Harris had played free safety and Delpit was slotted as a strong safety. From that spot, the 6-foot-3, 205-pound junior wreaked havoc on offenses last year and stuffed the stat sheet. He had five interceptions, five sacks, 9.5 tackles for loss and 14 passes defended to become an AP All-American in 2018. He established himself as a possible future first-round pick in the NFL draft. Without Harris, Delpit moved into the vacated role because he was best suited to be LSU's last line of defense. That put Delpit farther from the line of scrimmage, with fewer opportunities to blitz and run to the ball. JaCoby Stevens has played Delpit's role this season....
