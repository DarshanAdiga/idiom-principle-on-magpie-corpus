 "My hope is that we move educators up to frontline providers, because really that's what they are," Rivers said. "Having been a teacher myself, I believe our kids are probably a year behind."
 Stonier, who currently works as an educator with Evergreen Public Schools, said the Legislature will need to find a way to stabilize school funding. State support is based in part on enrollment, which plummeted this year. If lawmakers don't step in, districts might have to make some painful cuts that reverberate even after students return.
 "As enrollment starts to increase again, and kids need to come back," Stonier said, "we need to try to smooth that out as best we can and make funding more predictable for districts."
 Pandemic relief
 Small business and unemployment assistance will also top the legislative agenda in January.
 A jobs report released Friday indicates that hiring nationwide slowed dramatically last month as coronavirus cases spiked. In Clark County, new unemployment cases filed with the Employment Security Department more than doubled immediately after Gov. Jay Inslee announced new restrictions on bars and restaurant on Nov. 15.
 Ensuring that unemployment assistance from the embattled ESD makes it to individuals and families is among Stonier's top concerns. So is funneling direct cash assistance to small businesses through a statewide grant program.
 Rivers said she wants the Legislature to focus on regulatory relief to try and reduce the burden on businesses, like offering restaurants a onetime waiver on their liquor license renewal fee.
 "Small business often leads us out of economic downturn," Rivers said. "We have to take extraordinary members to keep those businesses in business."

 Results from Dominion Voting Systems machines handed the vote to Donald Trump in 12 of 14 counties where they were used in Pennsylvania. Nonetheless, Dominion was in on the act of stealing the election there and elsewhere.
 The paper ballot votes in Georgia aligned with the Dominion Voter Systems machine count. Somehow, however, that is also proof the voting machines stole the election.

Town Councilman Scott Hokonson, whose home was destroyed, assumed a fleet of relief workers would flood into town.
 He admits now his notion that "literally women and men on white horses or white trucks would come in and there would be trailers, and there'd be power and water and food" was unrealistic.
 There was no grand arrival of people who knew just what to do.
 So, with no place for shelter, town leaders huddled around the picnic table and used a stray garbage can as a windscreen to have a phone call with Gov. Jay Inslee, Hokonson recalled. Hokonson found himself taking charge as the picnic table at Malden's park became the gathering point for community meetings.
 Some people did show up to help, including Bill Tensfeld, Rosalia fire chief and the director of Whitman County Emergency management, and Paul Kimmell from Avista. Still, it quickly became clear that locals would have to lead.
 That's how Hokonson became one of the central leaders in the effort to help his community recover. He now is the executive director of the Pine Creek Community Restoration group.
 "I guess I looked around and there wasn't really anybody else," Hokonson said. "I just kept showing up and so that's how it kind of started."
 On Labor Day weekend, Malden was devastated when the Babb Road fire destroyed 80% of the homes in the town of roughly 200 people. The fire started when a tree snapped and fell into power lines operated by Avista. The power lines slapped together, igniting the tree, and less than an hour later flames were rapidly headed toward Malden, 40 miles south of Spokane.
 More than 120 homes in the Malden area were destroyed.
 Now, 12 weeks later, trucks rumble through the town headed to private properties where a state contractor is removing hazardous waste. Most of the lots in town are still full of rubble.
 But there are signs of life, with a handful of temporary trailers dotting one side of Malden Community Park. Avista provided the trailers to house city hall and the combined library and food bank, as well as state contractors who are clearing properties of hazardous waste.
 One white trailer with blue trim sports a laminated sign reading, "Pine Creek Community Restoration," and inside Hokonson works to put the town back together.
 He has been working to get the Pine Creek Community Restoration group set up. The group, led by Hokonson and a board of directors, will be a nonprofit that helps coordinate with federal, state and local agencies and other nonprofits on restoration efforts for Malden and Pine City.
 Setting up a long-term recovery organization is often the first step to community recovery and rebuilding, Hokonson said.
 Digging through the rubble
 Head to Malden on any given day, and you'll likely find Hokonson at work. Alongside him could be Gerry Bozarth, a disaster recovery specialist on loan from Spokane County, Hank Cramer from state emergency management, interim Mayor Dan Harwood, Kimmell and Tensfeld. This is the team guiding Malden through these next critical steps.
 Tensfeld spent 40 straight hours working the Malden fire, helping get everyone evacuated and managing fire crews. Still, to this day, he remains amazed that no one died in the fast-moving wildfire.
 "The biggest surprise to me was when the sun come up the morning after and there were no fatalities," Tensfeld said, still emotional about that day. "I could have bet $1,000 there would have been a dozen dead people."
 As a fire chief, Tensfeld's work in Malden was done after the fire was out. But as director of Whitman County Emergency Management, Tensfeld will be helping meet the immediate and long -term needs of the community.
 Tensfeld is the sole full-time employee of the Whitman County Emergency Management department, which also has one part-time employee. The emergencies they usually deal with are snowstorms, so they weren't prepared to tackle something as devastating as Malden Tensfeld said.
 Luckily, word travels fast, and a few days after the fire, Tensfeld's phone rang. Spokane County would be sending disaster recovery specialist Bozarth to Malden on indefinite loan to help him sort out the disaster.
 Not long after, Washington State Emergency Management sent a disaster expert of its own, Cramer. Cramer worked with the state's emergency management division for more than a decade before retiring to Winthrop, but his expertise is so valuable he often gets called out for disasters.
 Since the fire, Cramer has been living and working as a disaster recovery adviser out of a hotel in Colfax . He said it's important to recognize the locals leading long-term recovery efforts are also working in a state of trauma.
 "The biggest challenge is the total psychological trauma to everybody involved," Cramer said. "The people who were worst affected are the people whose lives were already in turmoil."
 Even people who felt they were on a good path before the fire are making major decisions while coping with the trauma, he said.
 Cramer sees his role as helping everyone "get through their personal trauma and the total disorientation of their normal world" and start rebuilding.
 Other disaster recovery experts lent their advice to local leaders. Carlene Anders worked to put together the recovery group in Pateros after the Carlton Complex fires devastated the region in 2014. Now she works as the executive director of the disaster leadership team, mentoring community leaders nationwide as they help their communities recover.
 While groups often start meeting right after the fire, it takes time to set up a mission, bylaws and a board of directors, she said. It took them about three months to do so in Pateros, she said.
 In Pateros, the Federal Emergency Management Agency quickly arrived and helped connect local leaders to nonprofit organizations that work in disaster relief.
 "FEMA did come for us and thank God they did," she said. "They were critical for us."
 While other states affected by wildfires this summer, including Oregon and California, quickly received FEMA aid, Malden has been in a holding pattern for months, limiting even the most basic cleanup efforts like removing hazardous materials so residents can return to their properties.
 Wildfires raged near Pateros at the same time they leveled Malden, but Anders still found time to mentor Hokonson on restoration efforts, despite having similar work to do close to home.
 "I am really excited and hopeful for Malden's group," Anders said. "It seems to be forming very nicely."
 The recovery group meets on Wednesdays to update the community on progress and share resources and other information. Meetings are held via Zoom.
 Local leaders step up
 Hokonson moved to Malden about four years ago in hopes of creating a quiet life where he could spend more time with his three sons.
 He bought a 1909 Sears kit Craftsman house that, despite having all original unpainted woodwork, needed a lot of work. Not long after moving to town, a fire came close to Malden. Hokonson happened to be home at the time and helped evacuate people.
 He was so helpful that after the disaster was averted, he was asked to join the fire department. A few months later, he was appointed to the town council.
 Before moving to Malden, Hokonson had worked in a variety of jobs — one for a home builder in Seattle helping homeowner organizations get set up and work with the builder, another working in facilities management for Target, and even as an arborist. He was pursuing a dual master's in social work and urban planning at Eastern Washington University until the fire put that on pause.
 Hokonson's Craftsman home burned to the ground in the fire. Luckily, he was insured and is now living temporarily in a rental home in Spokane. Despite losing everything, Hokonson wanted to help his community and began taking the lead on initial fire recovery.
 Since then, Avista has offered to cover Hokonson's salary as executive director for the recovery group. While he isn't getting paid yet, he has been putting in 80-hour weeks, something he admits bashfully.
 The work is beginning as there's a change in city leadership. Mayor Chris Ferrell resigned late last month. While Ferrell did not respond to requests for an interview, her fellow public servants were understanding about her resignation.
 When Ferrell became mayor about six years ago, the job was far less involved. Andrea Harp, who has lived in Malden for 45 years and served as mayor from 2003 to 2007, said it "really wasn't a lot of work."
 She mainly managed the water system and the fire department, and answered residents' questions, Harp said.
 "It's a volunteer position; you do not get paid," Harp said.
 Being mayor probably became a lot more work after losing city hall and, along with it, the town's records, not to mention dealing with answering residents' questions and fire recovery, Harp noted.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A new report by a National Academy of Sciences committee has found that “directed” microwave radiation is the likely cause of illnesses among American diplomats in Cuba and China.The study commissioned by the State Department and released Saturday is the latest attempt to find a cause for the mysterious illnesses that started to emerge in late 2016 among U.S. personnel in Havana.The study found that “directed, pulsed radio frequency energy appears to be the most plausible” explanation for symptoms that included intense head pressure, dizziness and cognitive difficulties. It found this explanation was more likely than other previously considered causes such as tropical disease or psychological issues. The study did not name a source for the energy and did not say it came as the result of an attack, though it did note that previous research on this type of injury was done in the former Soviet Union.In its report, the 19-member committee noted that it faced significant challenges in trying to get to the bottom of the medical mystery. Among them, not everyone reported the same symptoms and the National Academy of Sciences research did not have access to all the previous studies on the illnesses, some of which are classified.“The committee found these cases quite concerning, in part because of the plausible role of directed, pulsed radiofrequency energy as a mechanism, but also because of the significant suffering and debility that has occurred in some of these individuals,” said committee chairman David Relman, a professor of medicine at Stanford University. “We as a nation need to address these specific cases as well as the possibility of future cases with a concerted, coordinated, and comprehensive approach.”The health effects were experienced by about two dozen Americans affiliated with the U.S. Embassy in Cuba as well as Canadian diplomats and personnel at the U.S. consulate in Guanghzhou, China, in early 2017.Some of the Americans have been critical of the U.S. government’s response to their health complaints and at least one has filed suit against the State Department.Between late 2016 and May 2018, several U.S. and Canadian diplomats in Havana complained of health problems from an unknown cause. One U.S. government count put the number of American personnel affected at 26.Some reported hearing high-pitched sounds similar to crickets while at home or staying in hotels, leading to an early theory of a sonic attack.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

BATON ROUGE, La. (WBRC) - If Auburn is Alabama’s classic rivalry, LSU is not far behind. And this week in Death Valley, The Tide and the LSU Tigers faced off once again for one of the SEC’s grittiest showdowns. LSU came into the match up with a 3-4 record, with tough losses to Miss. St., Missouri, Texas A&amp;M and a particularly brutal 48-11 loss to Auburn. Alabama had come out on top in those same matchups and had managed to maintain an 8-0 record for the season; the only undefeated team left in the conference. This Alabama team has managed to reach new heights thanks to an incredibly dynamic offense that manages to showcase athleticism at every angle. Alabama scored on the opening drive. 7 plays spanning 75 yards. Mac Jones with the accuracy of a sharpshooter and a beautifully timed run, framed by blocks from the big guys to carry Najee Harris 14 yards into the endzone. In true rivalry fashion, the answering LSU possession seemed relentless as the Tigers picked up one first down after another. A total of 5 first downs and a third down conversion brought LSU to 4th and inches at the Alabama endzone. But the Bama D held up and the Tigers came up short, a devastating end after 11 plays, 60 yards and more than 4 minutes off the clock. Even that early in the game, getting shutdown against a team like Alabama can excrete an aura of doom that’s hard to ignore. The Tide scored on all five of their first 5 possessions, crossing receivers all over the place. Like the interchanged route where John Metchie crossed over to the right and brought three of the LSU secondary with him, leaving Billingsley wide open to the left to cradle a 24-yard pass from Mac Jones for a touchdown. The Tigers worked hard to stoke the flame, hammering through a 95-yard drive that was almost blown when Jontre Kirklin let go of the ball dangerously early, in anticipation of the touchdown as he approached the plane. But the call on the field stuck and the Tigers had some points on the board, down 21-7.But it was the following LSU possession that proved to be the shining moment, an outstanding 54-yard run straight into the Tide endzone. John Emery made the carry and with a crucial LSU block that kept the Tide secondary just out of arm’s reach as he broke the plane. The breakout moments were nice, but the true standard of a team set apart is consistency, and Alabama is capable of creating one outstanding moment after another. The defining moment for the Tide offense came with Devonte Smith three deep under secondary coverage. Jones placed the ball nice and high in the back of the endzone, where the tips of even the NFL’s most talented receiver might just be able to make it. And in super human fashion Smith leans back, arm outstretched with his spine curving in a deep C and picks the ball from it’s path out of bounds. It’s another touchdown for the Tide. Alabama plays like a well oiled machine. Mac Jones does not flinch in the pocket. He’s previously stated that he “Likes to get hit” and maybe that lack of fear is what frees his concentration to find opportunities and place the ball in extremely tight places. Jones finished the night 20-28 with 385 yards and 4 touchdown passes. Najee Harris knows out to pause just long enough to let the hole open where he needs it and gives Alabama reliable run game. He had 21 carries, 145 yards and 3 touchdowns Saturday night.The unflinching cohesion of this team ultimately proves unyielding as LSU falls to a final score of 55-17. It’s another rivalry matchup in the books and Alabama progress 9-0 for the season. Copyright 2020 WBRC. All rights reserved.

All Saint's Day is also a time when we can expect a change in the weather pattern from mild to cooler, from frost to freeze and killing frosts.

It seems that the acorn lore is all about cold or wet winter as it refers to a hard winter and a wet winter. Wet could mean snow, sleet, ice, and frozen rain. No matter what the acorn lore is, we will have to wait and see what winter has in store when it gets here.

The Truckload Carriers Association has named ABF Freight's Josh Elmore, from Lincolnton, N.C., a Highway Angel for stopping to help a driver after his vehicle collided with a dump truck.
   
 ABF Freight is based in Fort Smith.
   
 It was a beautiful summer morning and Josh Elmore was northbound on U.S. 220 near Madison, N.C. "I was talking to another driver and checking my mirrors and my speed," he said. "All of a sudden I saw a big cloud of smoke or dust in front of me. I realized there was a dump truck and car that had made contact."
   
 The car was spinning around ahead of Elmore in the left lane and the dump truck was in the right lane. "The car hit the guardrail," Elmore said. "I started getting on my brakes to slow and stop and make sure cars behind me didn't hit him. My first reaction was to stop, protect the scene, and then go check on the driver. I threw my hazards on and came to a stop, blocking traffic in the left lane." As Elmore jumped out, a power company truck stopped traffic in the right lane. He could see that the dump truck went around the bend and pulled over.
   
 Elmore went to check on the driver in the car. "There was debris all over the road," he said. "The driver's air bags had deployed and I didn't know what to expect." As Elmore approached the car he was relieved to see the driver was getting out. "I checked him for injuries and asked him several times if he was okay. He was able to walk around, but was shaken up. He said he was on his way to Raleigh for a business meeting." Elmore remained on the scene for about an hour. He said he's been in a wreck before and understands what it's like. "I try to help people when I can, show some compassion. Whatever happens, I hope I'm never in too much of a hurry to stop and help somebody.
   
 "I try to live by that code every day. That's the way I was raised."
   
 Since the program's inception in August 1997, nearly 1,300 professional truck drivers have been recognized as Highway Angels for the exemplary kindness, courtesy and courage they have displayed while on the job. Thanks to the program's Presenting Sponsor, EpicVue, and Supporting Sponsors, DriverFacts and Drivers Legal Plan, TCA is able to showcase drivers like Mr. Elmore.

Since I am not familiar with the source material, I am presuming that the episode was stretching itself out so that it could end on that cliffhanger, because my, did it seem to be relentlessly killing time! Sure, all of the flashbacks add a certain degree of context to the mental state of each character, and I believe that that there are some new scenes in among those flashbacks, but the writing and direction is also pulling out just about every trick in the book to make sure that nearly everything going on takes a little longer than it has to. Did we really need the montage of the various locales around town showing the snow starting to fall? This has never been a slow- paced series, so I guess they had to draw things out somewhere to achieve a proper stopping point at the end of the season, and this is that “somewhere.” Still, at least some effort was put into building the atmosphere for this turn of events, and the production merits are not bad.

 # GARY COSBY JR.: 2020 vote not an endorsement of liberalism
 Gary Cosby Jr.
 The Tuscaloosa News
 The 2020 national election certainly provided some eye-opening results. While Democrats claimed victory in the presidential election, that win was by no means a landslide. That alone should be a sobering post-election point for the Democratic Party to consider.
 Donald Trump was the very definition of an embattled incumbent, his presidency having multiple scandals, innumerable firings from key posts, lingering accusations of sexual misconduct from his pre-political days, and his mishandling of several critical domestic and international issues, not to mention the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis.
 Joe Biden did win by a substantial margin of more than 6 million votes. That would seem convincing until you see that Trump garnered almost 74 million votes, far more than he did in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton. This begs the question, how did so many American voters view Donald Trump in such a favorable light after a less-than-stellar performance as president?
 I think there are two answers and both answers should really shake Democrats to the core. First, America does not trust the Democratic Party. I think that is clear, especially when you look at the races in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. Republicans lost one Senate seat, though the Georgia runoff elections could change that. Even then, the Democrats will not hold the majority position in the Senate.
 In the House of Representatives, Republicans actually gained nine seats. That, friends, is not a sweeping victory for Democrats. Typically, when a candidate wins big in the presidential election, his coattails are long enough to provide a boost to his party in the Senate and the House. Not so this time. The poor performance by Democrats in those races indicates a clear and present danger to Democratic Party policies. To put it bluntly, the Democrats are too liberal to gain widespread trust from American voters.
 Yes, Biden won the presidential election, which leads to the second observation. Trump drew a stunning number of votes in an election that should not have been close. This points to the idea that people do not wish for the country to move further to the left. Many voters may have found Trump personally distasteful, but they believed that voting for him would protect the country from a move toward more socialism.
 People voting for Trump were at least voting against liberalism if not actually voting in support of the man, Donald Trump. I have yet to understand the strange way Trump managed to create a near cult-like following among his supporters. I have no explanation for that. He cultivated this devotion even among conservative Christians. The fact is indisputable that one of the most openly immoral persons I have seen run for president somehow drew in Christian voters by the millions.
 Part of that was at least due to the general Republican opposition to abortion. For those single-issue voters, and there are many of them, having the “R” beside a candidate’s name matters more than the name itself. These voters see themselves as voting to oppose the killing of the unborn. See Tommy Tuberville’s win as exhibit “A” for that argument. That, at least, I understand. It is the personal devotion to Trump that I can’t fathom, and I am certain that the Democratic Party fails to understand this as well.
 Here is the bottom line, far from repudiating Republican policies, the American public, if anything, gave them an endorsement. Yes, Donald Trump lost, but he lost in large part because he generated so much hate among voters who were not already in his camp. Trump inspired the turnout that ultimately cost him the election. There is some irony there. However, it is a wrong assumption to believe that Joe Biden won because the public believes he will be a great president or that people have grown weary of Republican policies.
 If that is the way you read these election results, you are missing the point. America voted far more to either repudiate or endorse Donald Trump than it did to endorse Joe Biden. American voters did not rush to endorse a swing to the left. America may well have voted to dismiss Trump, but it did not vote to swing liberal, not by a long shot. If Biden and the Democrats miss that point they will not hold the White House for more than one term.
 Consider this, Joe Biden is, at best, a placeholder. If the Republican Party can find a dynamic candidate who does not possess the personal demons of Donald Trump, it will be an easy win in four years. The results show America did not vote against Republican policy; rather, it voted quite specifically to oust Trump. While many reading this might not like that idea, it is the silver lining that gives hope to Republicans for the future.

 MANCHESTER, England, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United enjoyed comfortable wins in the Premier League on Saturday as fans returned to stadiums after an eight-month absence.
 Chelsea beat Leeds United 3-1 in front of 2,000 spectators at Stamford Bridge while Manchester United fought back from a goal down to win 3-1 at West Ham United -- their fifth straight comeback victory on the road -- in front of the same size crowd.
 Clubs in less restricted areas of England were allowed to welcome back 2,000 fans but in higher risk places games carried on behind closed doors with Manchester City beating Fulham 2-0 and Everton held to a 1-1 draw at Burnley.
 Chelsea moved top of the table as they came from behind to beat Leeds United 3-1 at home, set on their way by a fifth goal in four days from French forward Olivier Giroud.
 Giroud, 34, marked his first league start of the season - reward for his four goals in Chelsea's thrashing of Sevilla in the Champions League - by stretching to turn in a whipped cross by Reece James in the 27th minute.
 That cancelled out a fourth-minute opener for Leeds by Patrick Bamford.
 Chelsea went ahead in the 61st minute when Kurt Zouma jumped higher than everyone to power a Mason Mount corner into net and Christian Pulisic sealed the win in added time when he turned in a cross by Timo Werner.
 The win pushed Chelsea up to top spot with 22 points, leap-frogging Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool who both have 21 and play on Sunday.
 Manchester United moved up to fourth after recovering from a poor first-half display at West Ham.
 Czech midfielder Tomas Soucek put the hosts ahead in the 38th minute, turning in at the back post after Declan Rice had headed on a corner.
 CRUNCH MATCH
 United were well below their best, forcing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to bring on Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes from the bench at the break and although the Norwegian had been hoping to rest his key players ahead of Tuesday's Champions League crunch match in Leipzig, the move paid off.
 Portuguese midfielder Fernandes set up Paul Pogba for the equaliser in the 65th minute, the French midfielder scoring with brilliant side-foot curler from outside of the box.
 Mason Greenwood put United ahead with a superb short on the turn and Rashford completed the comeback in the 78th minute with a delicate chip.
 Manchester City are fifth after first-half goals from Raheem Sterling and Kevin de Bruyne secured a comfortable home win over struggling Fulham.
 Only a string of superb saves from Fulham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola denied City a bigger win after Sterling fired the hosts ahead and De Bruyne converted a 26th-minute penalty.
 Dominic Calvert-Lewin cancelled out Robbie Brady's opener as Carlo Ancelotti's Everton earned a point at Turf Moor.
 Burnley grabbed the lead in the third minute when Ashley Westwood fed Brady who drilled the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the box.
 Calvert-Lewin brought Everton level on the stroke of halftime, sliding in to meet a low cross by Richarlison for his 11th league goal of the season.

WASHINGTON (AP) — With time running out, lawmakers on Sunday closed in on a proposed&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;relief bill that would provide roughly $300 in extra federal weekly unemployment benefits but not another round of $1,200 in direct payments to most Americans, leaving that issue for&nbsp;President-elect Joe Biden&nbsp;to wrestle over with a new Congress next year.The $908 billion aid package to be released Monday would be attached to a larger year-end spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown this coming weekend.The cash payments were popular when they were first distributed after the pandemic hit, and Biden on Friday had expressed hope that a second wave might come after weekend negotiations.But senators involved in the talks said the checks won’t be included as part of the compromise, even as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others said that could cause them to oppose the measure.Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, indicated that excluding the checks while assuring small-business aid and renters’ assistance was the only way to reach agreement with Republicans who are putting firm limits on the bill’s final price tag.“The $1,200 check, it cost we believe nationally $300 billion to give you an idea,” he said. “The Democrats have always wanted a larger number, but we were told we couldn’t get anything through the Republicans, except this $900 billion level.”The plan being worked on by a group of Republican and Democratic senators is less than half of the Democrats’ push of $2.2 trillion and nearly double the $500 billion “targeted” package proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., agreed that a new round of direct checks “may be a go” at some point. “This is not a stimulus bill, it’s a relief bill,” he said. “And it’s something for the next three to four months to help those in greatest need.”Both he and Durbin said that McConnell has shown interest in the bipartisan effort, and Cassidy said he was hopeful that President Donald Trump would embrace it as well.The proposal is expected to include about $300 per week in bonus federal unemployment payments, providing relief just as emergency aid payments at regular benefit levels are set to expire at year’s end. It would extend a freeze on evictions for people who cannot pay their rent and reauthorize the Paycheck Protection Program to give a second round of subsidies to businesses struggling through the pandemic.Still, potential sticking points remain.Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said last week they wouldn’t support the $908 billion proposal if it did not include checks for families, and were joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are also against shielding businesses from lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks, a provision pushed by Republicans.While favoring the $1,200 checks, Biden said the emerging compromise was “immediately needed” and that additional assistance could follow later.On Sunday, lawmakers involved in the negotiations said the direct payments would have to wait until after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. At that time, Biden will face a new Congress as vaccines are being distributed, with a narrowed Democratic majority in the House and a closely divided Senate potentially split 50-50 if Democrats are able to prevail in two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Sanders was not involved in the negotiations and “his characterization is just not accurate” about the potential liability protections for businesses. The direct payments, he said, will be a task for Biden.Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said the bipartisan group was focused on extending the most urgent aid for the next four months.“Every indication says more money is needed; we see that,” he said. “This gets us through basically the lifelines that people need and the small businesses that can survive and not go under.”Manchin said Biden’s team, when in power, “can put together a different proposal that takes us further down the road for more recovery.”Durbin spoke on ABC’s “This Week,” Cassidy appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” Warner was on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Manchin was interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

EAU CLAIRE — Therese Olson has worked in the Christmas tree business for about 40 years but hasn’t faced a season like the current one.
 Nearly every aspect of Lowes Creek Tree Farm, which Olson owns with her husband Tim, has changed to some degree because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, those adjustments haven’t slowed purchases in the first few weeks of the season.
 The pandemic has presented challenges for local Christmas tree farms to ensure the safety of workers and customers, but it may also lead to an increase in sales. If more people stay home and don’t travel during the holidays, they have time to purchase and care for a tree. Tree shopping can also be done outside, making it a relatively safe group activity that has a far lower chance of spreading the virus than indoor gatherings.
 “We want everybody to be safe together and have a merry Christmas,” Olson said.
 It’s too early to tell how overall sales this year will compare to previous years, but early returns appear promising. Local operators said sales have occurred earlier this year for a few reasons: mild weather, people trying to avoid crowds and those celebrating the holidays early.
 Olson said a customer bought the first tree at Lowes Creek Tree Farm, S9475 Lowes Creek Rd., Eleva, in October because the customer planned to celebrate Christmas on Halloween. The customer, a parent, didn’t want to go trick-or- treating with kids and potentially spread or become infected with COVID-19.
 On the official opening day at Lowes Creek in mid-November, Olson said all freshly cut trees sold within an hour, and employees continued cutting throughout the day.
 Lowes Creek Tree Farm is following COVID-19 guidelines from the National Christmas Tree Association, which include social distancing; a face covering requirement; hand sanitizer stations throughout the farm; and two outdoor pay stations.
 Other changes include limiting capacity at the tree farm gift shop and having an employee whose sole responsibility involves cleaning high-touch surface areas. Some customers have called ahead to have workers bring a tree to their vehicle so they have limited exposure to other people.
 Olson said ideally the quality of the tree-buying process is the same but “offered in a little bit different environment.”
 Sarah Scharlau, manager of Pleasant Valley Tree Farms, N7240 810th St., Elk Mound, said the business has seen “very strong” sales in the first few weeks and is projecting a revenue increase of 5% to 10% from last year.
 The operation added an outdoor pay station to reduce indoor traffic and some sanitization is occurring as well, but Scharlau said the tree farm has tried to keep the process “as normal as possible” so people can still have pleasant memories in a decidedly abnormal year.
 Scharlau said customers have commented that they enjoy doing a family activity together with people in their immediate household and appreciate a familiar routine in an arduous, unpredictable year.
 At Kyle’s Christmas Trees and Wreaths, located on a lot just south of the intersection of Main Street and South Hastings Way, “pretty much everybody” has worn masks, according to Larry Davis, co-owner of the business.
 There are many repeat customers this year, but Davis has also dealt with plenty of first-time buyers. Davis said many regulars he has spoken to don’t plan to travel for Christmas.
 “Maybe that’ll mean more trees (sold),” Davis said.
 Some people have maintained the routine of buying a Christmas tree even if they will not not have visitors this year because of the pandemic. Tree farm operators called it rewarding to provide a sense of holiday cheer and Christmas spirit during an otherwise devastating, dispiriting year.
 When the pandemic first hit in full force in March, one of Olson’s first thoughts went to the Christmas tree season, so the business was well-prepared several months in advance.
 The company put significant work into ensuring everything runs as safe and smooth as possible, and Olson said customers have responded positively to the health precautions. Many people also said they intentionally bought from a local tree farm during such a difficult financial year for small businesses.
 Olson hopes all the precautions are not needed next year, but for the time being, she and her colleagues will try to make the tradition of buying a Christmas tree as safe as possible.

“Unfortunately, he did not win the state of Georgia,” Duncan said of Trump, who telephoned Kemp on Saturday to try to get him to convene the legislature to appoint electors who would overturn the Georgia result.
 A third Republican Georgia official who helped manage the election, Gabriel Sterling, also disputed Trump’s fraud claims in an appearance on a news talk show. Sterling last week held an impassioned news conference to decry a deluge of social media threats by Trump supporters against officials who upheld the count.
 “It is a game of whack-a-mole to even say: ‘The president’s statements are false,’” Sterling said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “This undermines democracy.”
 At his rally, Trump encouraged his supporters to continue to vent fury over the vote-counting process at those who oversaw it. “So far, we haven’t been able to find the people in Georgia willing to do the right thing,” the president said.

The Berejiklian government revealed a spate of changes last week, which kicked in on Monday, including scrapping the one person per four- square metres rule in favour of a one person per two-square metres – with gyms and nightclubs the exceptions.Standing will be allowed at hospitality venues, but only outdoors, while up to 5000 people can attend an outdoor event that is fenced, ticketed and seated, and stadiums can operate at 100 per cent capacity – just in time for the Test between Australia and India at the SCG.Up to 3000 people can gather outside for organised events, subject to the two-square- metre rule. Those looking to tie the knot can invite as many people they like to their wedding, with 50 guests allowed to hit the dance floor at any one time.A cap at funerals has also been scrapped.Nightclubs can open, with up to 50 people on the dancefloor at a time.The state government has also lifted the limit on outdoor gatherings to up to 100 people.NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet changes would inject millions of dollars into the economy and many people would be back in jobs after “freedom day” on December 7. “In terms of economic activity, you’re looking at hundreds of millions of dollars injected into NSW every single month,” he said.“It’s instant impact, this getting people straight back to work.”“From Monday, life will be very different in NSW,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Wednesday. From December 14, the work from home advice will be scrapped and NSW residents will be encouraged to return to the office.The news comes after another day of no local cases in NSW after a hotel quarantine worker tested positive last week, sparking a testing blitz.
