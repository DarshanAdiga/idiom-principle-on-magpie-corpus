Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina told CBS4’S Peter D’Oench, “We need to step up and say it like we see it. MY eyes are wide open. We are all suffering from this. It was horrific to see this. The callousness that was displayed. This is certainly not what I want any police department to be defined by. Life should be valued. It is outrageous because too many of us suffer from this after trying to do the right thing.”

Saturday morning, expect temperatures to start out in the lower 60s. Some areas of patchy fog are possible and we'll otherwise have a few lingering clouds. The rest of the day is mostly sunny and comfortably warm with highs reaching the lower 80s. Sunday is nearly a repeat, although it will be slightly cooler in the morning.

Germany and the European Commission have reached a pact on a giant Berlin- funded rescue plan for coronavirus-hit Lufthansa, a Commission spokeswoman and a source close to the negotiations said Friday.
 Since the pandemic hit Europe, the Lufthansa group -- which also includes Brussels and Austrian Airlines and Swiss -- has been bleeding one million euros per hour, with around 90 percent of its 760-aircraft fleet grounded.
 The deal would see the German carrier cede eight planes and their associated landing rights, the spokeswoman and the source said.
 German media had previously reported the European Commission would demand the group give up valuable takeoff and landing rights at its Frankfurt and Munich hubs in exchange for Brussels' green light.
 The nine-billion-euro ($9.9 billion) German state lifeline, would see Berlin take a 20-percent stake in the group, with an option to claim a further five percent plus one share to block hostile takeovers.
 That would make the federal government Lufthansa's biggest shareholder.
 On top of a total 5.7 billion euros in extra capital and 300 million to buy the shares at face value, public investment bank KfW would also lend Lufthansa three billion euros.
 The company would agree to pay back much of the capital plus interest, while granting the state two seats on its supervisory board.
 Hammering out the details of the package took so long because Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives were keen to minimise state control over the company's day-to-day running.

After nearly three months of limited contact with other people, we're all a little thirsty these days. Ever the comedic artiste, Maya Rudolph voices these desires with a silly flair and grounded humanity as a blood-lusting mosquito in "Thirsty," a delightful short film from rising filmmaker Nicole Delaney. "Thirsty" also stars Jay Ellis as The Young Man, who captures the mosquito's eyes and nose with his chiseled jawline and post-basketball game glow. "Thirsty" recently premiered on FXX as part of the channel's new Cake series, a showcase of inventive bite-sized content.

Before Rudolph's recording day, Delaney stayed up all night writing three different versions of the mosquito. "Do we play her earnestly, do we play her the crazy ex-girlfriend, or do we play her over the top, kind of horny, crazy Hormone Monstress-esque vibe?", said the filmmaker. "I knew whatever landed on Maya could nail any of those."
