LONG BEACH PENINSULA — The Ocean Beach School District, along with several north county school districts, closed down in-person learning beginning this week after a surge in cases throughout Pacific County.


  Along with OBSD, the Raymond, South Bend and Willapa Valley School Districts announced last week that they will transition back to a remote-only learning model for the time being. OBSD and South Bend announced that the earliest they may return to some form of in-person learning is Jan. 11.


  The districts opted to return to remote learning following a recommendation from the Pacific County Health and Human Services Department, as well as state recommendations. Pacific County’s case rate is currently more than 800 cases per 100,000 people over a two-week rolling average, putting it well into the high-risk category when it comes to schools holding in-person instruction.


  In a letter to families last week, OBSD said that some students will still receive on-campus services in order to meet targeted individual needs. Additional protocols will be enacted for these in-person interactions, the district said, with families of students being offered these services expected to be contacted this week.


  “We know that online learning is not an easy mode of learning for many students, and for some students, it does not work at all,” WVSD Superintendent Nancy Morris said. “Teachers struggle during distance learning to try to reach and support all students adequately due to the limitations of online platforms and limitations of our region’s lack of reliable internet connectivity.”


  “We know that returning to remote learning is not ideal for anyone and that this presents a huge challenge to parents, students, and school staff,” SBSD Superintendent Jon Tienhaara stated via his blog. “We are doing our very best to provide the best education and services possible while remaining in compliance with the recent health guidelines. Our goal is to return to in- person (hybrid) learning as soon as we can safely do so.”


  According to OBSD Superintendent Amy Huntley, there was one Ocean Beach class in quarantine as of Nov. 18 due to a previous positive covid-19 case. At that time, Huntley said the most recent coronavirus cases had a “minimal impact” on the district, but emphasized that the situation is fluid and could change at any moment.

Alaska’s November general election delivered some surprises in legislative elections, and once again there is an almost evenly split state House and a state Senate grappling with deep divisions in a Republican majority.


  It’s possible that Democrat-moderate Republican coalitions could emerge in both the state House and Senate.


  Regardless of that, the Mat-Su region still has the Legislature’s biggest and most influential delegation in the state capital, with three state senators and six representatives, all conservative Republican.


  The conservative “caucus” is even bigger when a senator from Eagle River is included, Republican Sen Lora Reinbold.


  There are also two Republican House members from Eagle River, Rep. Kelly Merrick and Ken McCarty, who defeated incumbent Rep. Sharon Jackson in the August primary election and went on to win the seat in the general election in November.


  Two surprises in November election result for the House was the knife-edge defeat of Rep. Lance Pruitt, R-Anch. by Democrat Liz Synder in Anchorage’s House District 27, and the defeat of Republican Rep. Mel Gillis by Democrat Calvin Schrage in House District 25, also in Anchorage.


  After all the counts are done the House may be divided 20-20, although that depends on decisions by two incoming lawmakers, Rep. Louise Stutes, Republican in Kodiak’s House District 32, who was reelected, and Josiah, Patkotak, an independent newly elected in House District 40, in Northwest Alaska and the North Slope.


  For House Democrats is assumed that two independents, Reps. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Dan Ortiz, I-Ketchikan, join with 16 Democrats who were elected. Edgmon, currently the House Speaker, and Ortiz joined the Democrat- led House coalition after the last election in 2018.


  Patkotak could join either side but has said he will side with fellow “bush” legislators, such as Reps. Neal Foster of Nome, a Democrat, and independent Edgmon, of Dillingham, to protect rural priorities like Power Cost Equalization, or PCE.


  Kodiak’s Stutes, a Republican, is part of the current coalition with Democrats. Like Patkotak, Stutes could join either faction but her commercial fisheries constituents in Kodiak and Cordova differ sharply with priorities of the GOP conservative wing led mostly by MatSu Republicans, who are pro-sports fishing among other things.


  A 20-20 split is untenable for the House because a majority of one side or the other, Republican or Democrat, is necessary to do business and even elect a presiding officer, much less pass legislation.


  A Republican margin of one or even two votes may not be enough to control the House, either, and the same may be true for a Democrat-led coalition with a similar margin.


  Reps. Steve Thompson and Bart LeBon, two Fairbanks Republicans, are part of the present House coalition with Democrats (Thompson is Majority Leader).


  Both issued statements that they will organize with Republicans this time but the two also appear to be hedging their bets.


  Thompson was targeted by conservative Republican Party activists for defeat in the August primary, an effort that took down several veteran moderates in Anchorage like Senate President Cathy Giessel and Reps. Jennifer Johnston and Chuck Kopp.


  Thompson survived the conservatives’ attempt to defeat him, though narrowly. That hasn’t created friendly feelings with his conservative colleagues.


  Moderate Republicans may have been afraid of cooperating with Democrats, fearing attacks in a closed Republican primary as happened in August. However, the passage of Ballot Measure 2, the so-called “election reform” measure does away with the closed Republican primary, assuming it survives a likely legal challenge.


  A lot will depend on how Thompson and LeBon, another moderate, are treated by the conservatives, meaning what agreements might be made on legislative priorities and what committee assignments they are offered by a GOP majority likely to be led by conservatives.


  Seats on the Finance committee, which controls the budget, are always important but even more so this year because of conservative Republicans’ emphasis on a large Permanent Fund Dividend and heavy budget pressures the state will be under next year.


  Thompson is a former House Finance cochair, and former Fairbanks mayor, while LeBon, who works in banking professionally, serves on the House Finance committee in the current Legislature, which ends in January when new lawmakers are sworn in.


  Meanwhile MatSu’s Rep. David Eastman, R-Wasilla, will again play a key role, in a kind of negative way, in the House organization.


  Eastman has a long traditional of voting “no” on almost every bill including the budget. In the new Legislature he may be joined by one other, or more, newly-elected representatives who are hard to the right like Eastman.


  While these votes reflect deeply felt views in Eastman’s case it creates a serious practical problem when the House is split 21-19. That’s because it takes 21 “yes” votes to pass a bill, even the budget.


  Unless a budget is passed by both House and Senate, and signed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, by June 30, the end of the state fiscal year, the state government shuts down because it cannot legally operate without an approved budget.


  If the Republican majority’s margin is 21-19, it is really 20-20 because Eastman is assumed a “no” vote. A split 20-20 vote means the bill, the budget being most important, does not pass the House. The same arithmetic holds for Democrats if they have a 21-19 margin, too.


  Eastman’s practice of voting no led to a handful of moderate Republicans crossing party lines to form a coalition in 2018 when the House was similarly split almost equally.


  If Stutes, Thompson or LeBon decide to join with Democrats, and Patkotak joins that camp, it could create a margin of 21 or 22.


  With the apparent defeat of Pruitt, now the Republican House Minority Leader, many look to Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Palmer, as a Republican with the capability of forging an agreement on the Republican side.


  But under almost any scenario it will be an interesting 2021 legislative session for state House members.


  Meanwhile, the state Senate has its own problems.


  There are now 13 Republicans and seven Democrats in the 20-member Senate but the appearance of solid GOP control is an illusion.


  Three of the GOP senators, Bert Stedman of Sitka; Gary Stevens of Kodiak and Click Bishop of Fairbanks are considered political moderates who have been part of prior Democrat-Republican coalitions. Stevens has twice been President of the Senate.


  Anchorage GOP Sen. Natasha von Imhof as well as Stevens, of Kodiak were targeted by Republican conservatives in the August primary, but narrowly survived.


  Senate conservative Republicans will have to persuade these four to join them, and the biggest obstacle to that will be the conservatives’ priority for a large PFD check. Stedman and von Imhof are cochairs of the Senate Finance Committee in the current Legislature and, being familiar with the state’s precarious finances, are on record opposing a large PFD.


  Given that, it’s possible that these two might split off over the PFD issue, and possibly all four of these senators may split with the conservatives.


  If that happens, a Democrat-moderate Republican coalition could control the senate 11-9.

Mas alla de los dos tantos convertidos por Thiago Almada (St. 28m. y 39m.), que lo convirtieron en figura de la lluviosa jornada en Liniers, el verdadero e involuntario protagonista del partido resulto ser el arbitro chileno Cristian Garay.


   

   

  El juez sudamericano anulo una conquista del elenco visitante, a priori licita. Y ademas demoro sistematicamente sus decisiones, recurriendo al VAR y expresando sus dudas, junto a todo el equipo arbitral.


   

  La revancha se jugara el martes 1 de diciembre, a las 21.30, en el estadio Pascual Guerrero de Cali.


   

  La lluvia amago con convertirse en la verdadera figura de la primera mitad. Primero, porque arrecio en Liniers durante los primeros diez minutos. Sin embargo, el vertigo empezo a ganar espacio y el partido se hizo de ida y vuelta, pero sin llegadas claras.


   

  En ese contexto, Deportivo Cali lucio mejor, con laterales que se animaron a pasar reiteradamente y con mediocampistas que presionaron arriba, en procura de la equivocacion rival.


   

  El conjunto visitante, pese a lo apuntado, no tuvo maniobras claras para desnivelar y sus intentos se redujeron a remates desde fuera del area de Angelo Rodriguez, el argentino Agustin Palavecino (ex Platense) o Deiber Caicedo, que salieron desviados.


   

  Paradojicamente, con menor tiempo de posesion del balon, Velez fue mas practico y lo utilizo mejor, sobre todo cuando paso por los pies de Federico Mancuello, quien le otorgo claridad a cada una de sus intervenciones.


   

  La mas clara del equipo del DT Mauricio Pellegrino ocurrio a los 22m., cuando Tomas Guidara envio un centro desde derecha y propicio un cabezazo a quemarropa de Lucas Janson, que fue detenido por el arquero visitante, David Gonzalez.


   

  El primer tiempo se marchaba sin contratiempos, cuando sobre los 44m., la actuacion del juez chileno Cristian Garay gano preponderancia.


   

  El mediocampista Valencia envio centro desde la derecha y su colega Jhon Vasquez se elevo en el area ante la marca de Tomas Guidara y ejecuto un cabezazo limpio, que se traducia en la apertura del tanteador.


   

  El arbitro anulo la maniobra por una aparente infraccion que no se observo y que el VAR (Video Assistant Referee) no reviso, aun cuando la tecnologia estuvo a disposicion.


   

  La segunda parte tambien tuvo otra accion con nitido protagonismo del dispositivo tecnologico de moda. A los 20m., un tiro libre al corazon del area termino con un remate de Janson que se le colo arriba al arquero Gonzalez. Sin embargo, despues de cinco minutos de analisis, observaciones y cabildeos, el chileno Garay invalido la conquista por una posicion adelantada muy fina del peruano Luis Abram.


   

  A esa altura, Velez ya habia emparejado el desarrollo, con un Almada que se animaba mas y mostraba el desenfado que le es habitual.


   

  Entonces, el pibe de Fuerte Apache sentencio el partido por duplicado. Primero, a los 28 minutos, el mediapunta llego para empujar un rebote largo que dio el arquero Gonzalez ante un centro desde la derecha que mando el ingresado Tarragona.


   

  Y luego, a los 39m., el goleador sentencio la historia con anticipo en el area chica, tras una buena proyeccion de Ortega por izquierda.


   

  Todavia hubo una accion mas discutida por los protagonistas que se dio en tiempo de descuento (46m.), cuando Miguel Brizuela tomo del brazo en el area a Angelo Rodriguez. Luego de ocho minutos de revisiones, el juez Garay sanciono el penal pertinente. La ejecucion del ingresado Lizarazo permitio una excelente intervencion del arquero Hoyos, que rechazo el tiro al corner.


   

  Asi, en un encuentro controvertido y que le fue esquivo durante un tramo largo, Velez se abrazo a la victoria y tomo una ventaja importante, con miras a la revancha de la semana entrante.

With the Biden victory in Arizona, aka McCain's Revenge, the extent of the Donald Trump election rejection is now documented. Nevermind his desperate fantasies of a legal tap dance to victory -- can you imagine Donald Trump tap dancing? -- there's no way to soft shoe over the reality of a 5 million popular vote loss to Joe Biden and, more importantly, Biden's 306 electoral college accumulation. That's what the Trumpster collected last time around, which he called a "landslide." No matter how many thousands of his MAGA supporters crowded the streets in a show of support for the delusion that he couldn't possibly lose the election, he did. And on Jan. 20, one way or the other, Trump will be extracted from the White House. Then what? We know what President Biden will be doing. He'll be following a really bad act and trying to rebuild a country that was wrecked by the former president. But what about that former president? Besides trying to stay ahead of his legal problems, stay out of jail and avoid financial ruin, what will he be doing during his forced Mara Lago phase? Perhaps he will rename it Elba Lago. Will Melania Trump follow him to Florida? She perfected her enigma act when she was first lady, and there's really no telling what she will do or where she will go in her afterlife. But what mischief will Donald Trump get into once he doesn't have the power to sabotage the transition? What will he do when he's not meeting with his attorneys? Speaking of attorneys, will Rudy Giuliani continue as his lead lawyer, or will Trump opt for someone who is not as loopy? How will ex-President Trump plot his triumphal return as POTUS in 2024? Will he be so discredited by then that it won't be possible? In any case, he will need to contrive how to follow the two pursuits that he cares about most in life: making money and getting attention. Will he be satisfied with doing 1-800 ads on television, hawking Trump-branded products? He will certainly do that. Will there be a ghost-written memoir? Will he make highly paid speeches to supplement his dwindling fortune? Will he go whole hog with his Biden heckle hustle and actually start his own news network? If so, what will it be called? Yes, I know Trump News Network, TNN, is likely. But that's so obvious. As for President Biden, he will certainly provide plenty of material to mock. First of all, he may be chief executive, but he's still open-mouth, insert-foot Joe Biden. Not only that, cleaning up the Trumpian mess will be uh, messy, as in politically fraught. It will be easy to second-guess the dreary steps the new administration will have to take to suppress the coronavirus and return us to a new normal, which will not be much like the old normal. For example, Biden has been invited to throw out the first pitch of the Washington Nationals season. But that assumes there will be another season for Major League Baseball. Will the Republicans play ball with the administration, particularly if they hold control of the Senate? If Donald Trump is still in control of the party and exercising what could be called "Trump's Revenge," it could be even less likely.

They opened the postseason with a 58-14 win over Roseville. Since De La Salle has beaten Lakeview 35-6 and previously undefeated Port Huron 36-0.


  A regional championship game is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 15, at Warren- Mott. Kickoff is 7 p.m.


  “The wheels fell off against DeWitt, especially in the first half. Anything that could go wrong did go wrong. Our starters had played so much up to that point, I think we just broke down.

  “Even when we played Cass Tech two weeks later, we came out in the second half and fought. That showed me something. We felt we were going in the right direction,” the coach continued.


  The Pilots fell 35-0 to the Technicians.

Verbal abuse won’t be tolerated during the series with fierce rivals India, Australia coach Justin Langer said Wednesday, promising his team had moved on from their days of harsh sledging.


  Previous clashes between the cricketing heavyweights have been marked by bitter rows, and Australian opener David Warner said this week that he expects Virat Kohli’s men will try to wind him up during the tour.


  But Langer said the Australians would keep any exchanges within the spirit of the game.


  “There’s plenty of room for banter, having fun and having that competitive instinct but there’s no room for abuse,” he told reporters on a conference call.


  Langer took over in late 2018 vowing to change the win-at-all-costs mentality that led to the infamous ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.


  He said the culture of the team, once notorious for sledging, or verbal abuse, was now different.


  “Anyone who’s watched what’s happened in the last couple of years (can see), we’ve talked about our behaviours on and off the field,” he said.


  That does not mean it will all be sweetness and light, with Langer pointing to a heated verbal exchange between Kohli and Australia’s Test captain Tim Paine during India’s last tour in 2018-19.


  “We loved what Virat Kohli was doing, there was a great sense of humour and a great sense of theatre to it all,” he said.


  Langer hinted he was taking a conservative approach to Australia’s main selection dilemma: whether rising star Will Pucovski should replace out-of- form veteran Joe Burns at the top of the batting order.


  “We think very, very highly of Will, he has enormous talent. When the opportunity comes, he’s ready to play Test cricket,” he said.


  “The opportunity hopefully will come for him at some point, whether it’s this series or a series to come.”


  While all signs are that Burns will get the nod, Test greats such as Michael Clarke, Ian Chappell and Mark Waugh have been clamouring for Pucovski’s inclusion after the 22-year-old plundered back-to-back double centuries for Victoria.


  Australia and India will play the first of three one-dayers in Sydney on Friday, followed by three Twenty20 matches and four Tests.


  Langer said the tour was economically important for cash-strapped Cricket Australia, but also a welcome distraction for cricket lovers everywhere during the Covid-19 pandemic.


  “To watch Australia and India is going to be great entertainment,” he said.


  “Hopefully it’s going to put some smiles on people’s faces, that’s the bigger picture we’re looking at.”

Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike is scheduled to hold a news conference at 5 p.m. in which she is expected to disclose new measures to deal with the recent spike in coronavirus cases.


  The request will apply from Saturday, local broadcaster TBS reported, citing an unidentified person.


  The plans come a day after a surge in serious COVID-19 cases in the city. Severe cases, which the area defines as those on a ventilator or ECMO machine, jumped 24% on Tuesday to a total of 51, the highest level Tokyo has seen since the start of the pandemic. The seven-day average of coronavirus cases in Tokyo has more than doubled over two weeks to more than 400. Similar restrictions on retail activity were adopted earlier this year as the outbreak took root in Japan.


  Just last week, Koike said the number of severe cases, rather than the number of new infections, were her "red line” that would spur further action.


  "Keeping the number of severe cases is the most important thing, the red line,” Koike told a briefing last week, asked why she had not yet requested stores to close early. "That will be used as the base for any decision.”


  It was unclear exactly what kind of stores would be asked to close, although a similar request during a summer surge applied to businesses such as bars and karaoke parlors, as well as restaurants.


  The capital and its neighboring prefectures account for about a third of Japan’s gross domestic product, so any limitations on businesses would have an outsize effect on the economy. Authorities have been reluctant to take firmer steps for fear of pushing Japan back into recession.


  The request will also come at what is already a tough time for Tokyo’s thousands of bars and restaurants. In any other year, they’d largely fully booked for year-end office parties, known as _bonenkai_ , or "forget-the-year gatherings.” But despite Japan’s success in combating the pandemic, most companies are refraining from such events this year, with almost 90% of more than 8,000 companies surveyed by Tokyo Shoko Research saying they don’t plan to hold such events.


  Both Tokyo and national authorities have already called on people to take extra care while having meals. Koike introduced guidelines last week calling on people to keep groups small, meals short and their voices down while gathering, while Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has called on people to continue wearing masks when talking during meals.


  The metropolitan government plans to offer financial support to stores that follow the request, TBS reported. Japanese authorities are limited in the powers they have to enforce early closures or shutdowns.


  Tokyo is just one of several metropolitan areas in Japan battling the latest surge in infections, with the northern island of Hokkaido already calling on people to avoid unnecessary trips outdoors, and Osaka moving to reduce opening hours. A popular campaign to spur domestic travel, which some have blamed for spreading infections, is also being partly suspended.

I have seen your poll and wanted an opportunity to submit my take. Out of the 4 candidates mentioned, I really would like to see us give Holmes the chance. I mean, look at how well he does in the draft every year! He hasn't even had a first-round pick to use in years and they still build good teams for McVay. The other 3 have proven they can pick good players but not build championship rosters. At the end of the day, I want to see a winning product as often as possible! So, let's give Holmes the leg up!!

Electric vehicles are coming, faster than many would like to acknowledge. Yes, there are upsides to EVs including efficiency, lack of generated pollutants from internal combustion, lower operation and maintenance costs, and remarkable performance and cutting-edge technology. Yes there are drawbacks, too, including heavy batteries that still have a way to go to reach peak longevity, lack of charging infrastructure, higher up-front purchase costs and longer “refueling” or recharging times.


  Still, they are coming. Many countries around the world have already set dates to ban sales of new gasoline and diesel powered vehicles and others have proposed plans to do the same.


  France and Spain have set their sights on 2040; Scotland is aiming for 2032; Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Slovenia, and Sweden are shooting for 2030. Even California, while only a state, is attempting to halt the sale of new internal combustion vehicles beginning in 2040.

  # Trucking company expands to Bushnell


  Steven Barnum


  Voice Correspondent


  BUSHNELL — Justil Parcel Delivery Inc., a Peoria area trucking company, announced that they have secured a new location in Bushnell.


  The company is contracted through FedEx Ground to provide parcel pickup and delivery and has been in existence for 22 years, according to Owner and Operator Darwin Runyon. In the past, doing business in the Bushnell area required drivers to make the trek from the Peoria area. Now, the Bushnell location allows them to significantly reduce travel and to keep drivers alert and energized, Runyon said.


  Runyon said that COVID-19 sparked a spike in demand for electronic commerce and delivery. Thus, in 2020, business has soared for essential companies like his.


  “It’s been an exciting year and we’re excited to hire some local workers,” Runyon said. “But as much as we like e-commerce, we’d like to see local businesses survive and continue to operate.”


  All eight of the newly-hired employees reside in McDonough and Knox Counties, according to Runyon, who said that they plan to hire at least two more people in the near future.


  The building, located on RT 41 in Bushnell, is currently undergoing improvements. Runyon said that the landlord who leased them the building is allowing them to make all of the necessary alterations in order to meet their needs. He said that he is thankful for the community’s support.


  “We’ve been appreciative of the Bushnell community helping us get this up and running – with the local contractors and workers and person who owns the building…,” he said. “They’ve all been very accommodating.”

Given the way that _Apex_ drops players into the match, this reasoning makes sense, as it would have been easy to assume that players might have accidentally tried to land in those flat additional cities. And at the end of the day, their appearance or absence doesn't take away from how cool the map itself is.
 The Olympus map is just one showcase of how much Apex Legends has grown over the past year and some change -- something that is seemingly set to continue.
 "The other [focus] is: how do we expand it?" game director Chad Grenier previously told EuroGamer. "So that means new players, new platforms, and it also means new ways to play _Apex_."
 "Right now we're a battle royale game," Grenier continued. "I think if you look into the future, we have a lot of conversations of, you know, should we expand beyond battle royale? We have this roster of legends that people love - how else can we use them? I think looking into the future, you're probably going to see the game becoming more than just a battle royale game. You see we have all these LTMs (limited time modes) and other ways to play. I think that's a great starting point."

In light of the new law in Pennsylvania, it is important to check your estate planning documents to make sure that your documents address digital assets. For example, check your Durable Power of Attorney to make sure that it specifically discusses digital accounts and assets. It is also important to check your online accounts and read the terms and conditions of the service agreement. Often social medial platforms, and online accounts grant their users the ability to grant access to a third party in the event of your death or incapacity. For example, Facebook allows you to designate a legacy contact.

He still looks the same young man from last year's national championship game more often than not to me. It seems to me that whoever the GM and head coach for the Falcons in 2021 are, will truly have to look at him in particular.

Sen. Marco Rubio, another potential White House hopeful, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will consider Blinken's nomination, broadly wrote off the early selections.


  "Biden's cabinet picks went to Ivy League schools, have strong resumes, attend all the right conferences & will be polite & orderly caretakers of America's decline," Rubio tweeted.


  Biden said his choices "reflect the idea that we cannot meet these challenges with old thinking and unchanged habits." He said he tasked them with reasserting global and moral leadership, a clear swipe at Trump, who has resisted many traditional foreign alliances.


  The president-elect said he was "struck" by how world leaders have repeatedly told him during congratulatory calls that they look forward to the U.S. "reasserting its historic role as a global leader" under his administration.


  Trump, who has debated recently whether to mount another presidential campaign in 2024, appeared to defend his worldview on Tuesday.


  "We shouldn't go away from that -- America First," he said at the annual turkey pardon, a lighthearted pre-Thanksgiving White House tradition.


  While Trump expected total loyalty from his Cabinet and chafed at pushback from advisers, Biden said he expected advisers to tell me "what I need to know, not what I want to know."


  Further drawing a contrast with Trump, Haines said she accepted Biden's nomination knowing that "you value the perspective of the intelligence community, and that you will do so even when what I have to say may be inconvenient or difficult."


  Haines said she has "never shied away from speaking truth to power" and added "that will be my charge as director of national intelligence."


  Biden celebrated the diversity of his picks, offering a particularly poignant tribute to Thomas-Greenfield. The eldest of eight children who grew up in segregated Louisiana, she was the first to graduate from high school and college in her family. The diplomat, in turn, said that with his selections, Biden is achieving much more than a changing of the guard.


  "My fellow career diplomats and public servants around the world, I want to say to you, 'America is back, multilateralism is back, diplomacy is back,'" Thomas-Greenfield said.


  Mayorkas, who is Cuban American, also offered a nod to his immigrant upbringing.


  "My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism," he said. "They cherished our democracy, and were intensely proud to become United States citizens, as was I."


  But Mayorkas might pose the most difficult confirmation challenge from Biden's early round of nominees.


  The Senate previously confirmed him in December 2013 by a party-line vote to be the deputy secretary of Homeland Security. The Senate was controlled by Democrats then, and all of the chamber's Republicans voted against his confirmation mainly because he was then under investigation by the inspector general in that department who had been appointed by President Barack Obama. At the time, the Senate historian's office said it was unprecedented for the Senate to vote on a nominee who was under investigation.


  The inspector general, John Roth, found in March 2015 that Mayorkas, as director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to give special treatment to certain people as part of the visa program that gives residency preference to immigrants who agree to invest in the U.S. economy.


  Meanwhile, there were signs on Tuesday that the stalled formal transition of power is now underway. Biden's team now is in contact with all federal agencies, according to a transition official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe developments that have not been announced.


  At the Pentagon, Kash Patel, chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense, is heading the department's transition work. A transition task force has been assembled, led by Tom Muir, head of the Pentagon office that provides administrative and management services to all Defense Department facilities in the Washington area.


  Muir said the first meeting with Biden's team was held virtually on Tuesday morning and that he expected daily meetings to come -- some virtually and some in person. He said normal accommodations for the Biden team have been made, including provision of briefing materials, video-teleconferencing capabilities, and office space inside the Pentagon.


  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also said his agency is working to get briefing materials to Biden's aides immediately and pledged a "professional, cooperative and collaborative" transition.


  The moves came a day after the head of the General Services Administration wrote the necessary letter of "ascertainment" acknowledging Biden as the apparent winner of the election, triggering the transition process.


  Trump, who continues to press a legal challenge to overturn the election results, again on Tuesday refused to concede his election loss.


  Trump tweeted that "the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be."

Black Lives Matter came up with the single most effective political slogan of the year. While no one was likely to be overly impressed with Joe Biden's line, "Build Back Better," and Donald Trump's "Keep America Great" or "Make America Great Again, Again" didn't have the resonance of the original 2016 version, BLM broke through the clutter with a catchphrase that was memorable, pungent -- and utterly devastating to Democrats. After a surprising Tory victory in the British parliamentary election in 1992, the pro-Tory tabloid The Sun famously boasted, "It's the Sun Wot Won It." In the same spirit, it could be said that in this year's congressional election, "It's 'Defund the Police' Wot Lost It." Democrats have an uphill battle to take the U.S. Senate -- pending two Georgia run-offs -- and suffered shocking setbacks in the House that drastically diminished their majority. All over the map, Democrats got hammered on defunding the police, which couldn't have been better designed to extract maximum political pain with zero upside. Black Lives Matter has been a stunning success in the elite culture. It won the obeisance of almost every major institution, from corporate America to sports leagues to colleges. It created a powerful, if dishonest, narrative of systemic police racism. It got invested with nearly a holy significance, such that criticizing it is considered at least a sin and perhaps a firing offense. Much more importantly, at least for a time after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, it won the goodwill of a clear majority of Americans. To take this position of strength and use it primarily to associate your allies with a politically radioactive position requires extraordinary strategic folly and heedless ideological fanaticism. BLM had both, in ample supply. The notion of defunding the police had been rattling around the left for a long time, but the George Floyd protests took it mainstream. BLM pushed municipalities to actually act on the proposal. Whenever someone tried to take the edge off defunding the police by redefining it as simply reallocating some law- enforcement dollars, defenders piped up to say, No, we really mean it. The New York Times ran an op-ed against incrementalist interpretations, "Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police." Predictably, Republicans took the weapon handed to them and used it, as Democrats would have done if a voluble faction on the right called for, say, abolishing child welfare agencies. The effectiveness of the attack now has Democrats who are otherwise loath to speak ill of BLM complaining about what its catchy slogan did to the party. After support for BLM surged last spring, positive feelings for it have been declining. A Pew Research report showed support for BLM dropping from 67% in June to 55% in September. Only 45% of white people expressed support for the movement. Given that BLM elevated the dumbest, most self-destructive slogan in American politics in a very long time, and an even more atrocious policy, its numbers deserve to fall further. Advocates of defunding the police argued that setting out an extreme position could have a political effect even if it had no chance of enactment. They proved exactly right -- just not how they expected. Rich Lowry is editor of the National Review. (c) 2020 by King Features Synd., Inc.

This fundamental right to equal weight was not defended or actualized in this election. There is evidence of ballots being discarded, hundreds of thousands of ballots appearing out of thin air, ballot harvesting, and a lower standard of verification for some mail-in ballots. This is voter fraud and has infringed upon Americansâ€™ sacred right to vote and for their votes to carry equal weight.
