The 60% reduction to its April schedule is due to additional travel restrictions and steps to battle the virus outbreak. Even at that reduced rate of flying, it expected to fill only 20% to 30% of seats. That is not only far below the 84% of seats that it sold throughout last year, but it is far below the roughly 65% of seats that an airline needs to sell to just break even.

“In an instant, the dreams that UCO’s qualifiers had of becoming an all- American or contending for a national championship were dashed. For Karstetter and Moore, it was even more devastating.
 “‘I didn’t think it was real,’ Moore said of hearing the news. ‘It felt like I was in a movie. Ever since then I’ve had a feeling that something’s missing, there’s something I can’t accomplish. It’s like a missing puzzle piece that I can’t find to put in.’
 “A Putnam City High School product who spent four years at West Virginia before transferring to UCO for his final season, Moore was on a roll entering the national tournament. He had battled Filippo for the starting spot at 149 pounds throughout the season while also seeing time at 157 and then jumped to 165 for the Regional IV Tournament. Moore went 5-1 in that tournament in finishing third to earn a qualifying berth, with his only loss a tough 3-2 decision to the top-ranked wrestler in the country.
 “‘I had all that momentum from the regional and then nationals gets cancelled,’ said Moore, who finished the season 26-8 with a team-high 14 falls. ‘Every time I hear the word coronavirus I’m reminded about it, and I hear that word a thousand times a day. It still hurts.’

This said, manufacturers might not necessarily find this beneficial.

Her departure left a huge hole on the team.
 Chayse Capps ultimately filled a big part of the void -- and the Sooners won another national title.

“Karstetter, like Moore, is in his fifth year of college. He’s battled injuries throughout a career that saw him attend two Division I universities and Northeastern Oklahoma A&M before landing at UCO two years ago. After settling into the lineup at 133 early in the second semester, Karstetter had been making plenty of noise. He had beaten several ranked wrestlers, qualified for nationals with a regional runner-up finish and was excited about ending his career standing on the podium as an All-American.
 “It was not to be.
 “‘With social media it’s easy to see the news spread, and I saw stuff getting shut down left and right as we were on the bus heading to the tournament,’ Karstetter said. ‘As a wrestler, you think there’s no way that’s going to happen, especially after we got there and got comfortable. We spent the night, ate breakfast and went to practice. I wasn’t really thinking about it that much because I was really focused on the tournament. And then it all blew up.’
 “A week later, the emotions are still raw for Karstetter. ‘This Pandemic is a bad situation and hopefully it gets settled,’ the Tulsa native said. “But as far as my athletic career is concerned, I’m gonna be selfish about it. It means a lot to you when you’ve grown up around the sport and always looked forward to competing in the national tournament, and then when you finally get a chance to do that, it’s ripped away. Others are talking about their seasons ending, and I’m talking about my career ending. I’m hopeful that those who qualified for nationals get another year, or at least another semester, but I know that’s probably a long shot.’
