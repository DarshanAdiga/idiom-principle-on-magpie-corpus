He worries that so many of the supplies and testing resources that are needed are not yet available. "Right now, the testing is only for people with symptoms," he said. "We need to start testing people who are asymptomatic as well. Ideally, you'll want to test the entire population on a regular basis. That's unlikely, but we have to prioritize and get going."

The home office deduction was misused in the past, which made it an audit red flag. In light of the coronavirus pandemic, the IRS will most likely have a difficult time making the argument that a large number of Americans weren’t working from home for part of 2020. That’s assuming you keep good records and actually qualify for the deduction. I must repeat, if you are a W-2 employee, you will not be eligible for the home office deduction thanks to the Trump tax plan.

Expect political ads mentioning the pandemic to continue for the time being. Advertising Analytics says while it’s difficult to project messaging trends out too far, given how quickly the political landscape shifts, it seems that Covid-19 will be the largest topic of ads in 2020. Not   all of the ads will be on this topic, however. We’re already seeing the curve of ads mentioning Covid-19 smooth out at around 40-45% of political ads. However, this could easily increase or decrease depending on if there is a second wave or a vaccine or some other drastic event. For the week of March 10, in local broadcast, candidates spent $467,000 on ads that mentioned Covid-19. In the most recent available data (week of April 28), it had risen to $3.2 million.
