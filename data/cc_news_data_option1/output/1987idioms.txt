Last week, it was _Grand Theft Auto V_. This week, it’s _Sid Meier’s Civilisation VI_.

BERLIN -   A new generator will ensure the town can continue its efforts to keep electric costs low.
 On Friday, crews delivered the town's new 2-megawatt, natural gas generator to replace the one that failed last July. Once it's up and running, the town will have four engines to generate power when purchase costs are high.
 "During peak high demand we'll start these engines to cut the amount of load that we're purchasing from the grid," said Tim Lawrence, the town's electric utility director.
 According to Lawrence, the electric department typically has four functioning generators to use during peak times in the summer and winter. By using the generators, the town is able to reduce the amount of power it has to purchase off the grid.

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 21st May, 2020) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday accused Russia of using imagery, obtained during Open Skies overflights, to support the doctrine of targeting critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe with precision-guided conventional munitions.
 "Moscow appears to use Open Skies imagery in support of an aggressive new Russian doctrine of targeting critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe with precision-guided conventional munitions," Pompeo said in a statement. "Rather than using the Open Skies Treaty as a mechanism for improving trust and confidence through military transparency, Russia has, therefore, weaponized the Treaty by making it into a tool of intimidation and threat.

OCEAN CITY -- Quietly amid the uncertainties surrounding the ongoing pandemic and the impact on the summer season, resort officials this week approved a fiscal year 2021 "Plan B" budget amounting to a property tax reduction for most.
 When first presented in March, the proposed fiscal year 2021 budget for all funds came in around $156 million including enterprise funds. The all- important general fund budget in the original Plan A, or pre-COVID-19 budget, came in around $97 million and was based on anticipated revenues and expenditures in the coming year.
 At the same time, City Manager Doug Miller and Budget Manager Jennie Knapp presented a Plan B budget that attempted to account for the potential and realized ramifications of COVID-19 with adjusted estimates on certain revenue sources including room tax, for example.
 For second reading on Monday, the Mayor and Council had before them proposed Plan B budget, which had been pared down from the original spending plan. The Plan B budget approved unanimously by the council on Monday comes in at roughly $136 million, or about $20 million less than what was first proposed. The general fund under Plan B is around $89 million, also significantly less than what was originally proposed.

El presidente Alberto Fernández ratificó hoy que su gobierno no asumirá "ningún compromiso con la deuda que postergue a los argentinos" y aseguró que la economía del país volverá a "levantarse", como en 2003, una vez que pase la pandemia de coronavirus, al encabezar un acto junto al gobernador Gerardo Zamora en Santiago del Estero, en el primer viaje al interior del país desde el inicio del aislamiento social.      “En estos días que leo en los diarios que corremos el peligro de caer en default mañana, me pregunto por qué se mienten así, si estamos en default desde antes de diciembre, solo que no lo escriben, lo ocultan”, advirtió Fernández.      "Renuevo mi compromiso con cada argentino; no vamos a asumir ningún compromiso con nuestra deuda que postergue a los argentinos; no vamos a someter a la Argentina a nuevos compromisos que no podamos cumplir”, añadió.      Así se pronunció el Presidente, en la Escuela del Bicentenario de Santiago del Estero, un monumento histórico provincial, cuya obra de reparación está paralizada desde abril del 2019 por la falta de giro de fondos por parte de la anterior gestión nacional, a través del denominado Plan Belgrano.      Fernández visitó la provincia, acompañado por los ministros del Interior, Eduardo de Pedro; y de Obras Públicas, Gabriel Katopodis; el secretario General de la Presidencia, Julio Vitobello; y el secretario de Obras Públicas, Martín Gill.      "Quiero que el mundo nos vea como un país honorable que cumple con sus compromisos, por lo tanto no vamos a hacer más de lo que debamos hacer y que nuestros compromisos no signifiquen una nueva postergación de nuestro pueblo”, enfatizó durante el acto, en el que dedicó palabras elogiosas al gobernador Zamora, con quien dijo compartir la "mirada" de lo que "necesita el pueblo", pese a que ambos provienen de orígenes políticos distintos, en alusión a la pertenencia radical del mandatario provincial.      Fernández replicó palabras de Zamora en cuanto que "no está en discusión la bondad del capitalismo", sino "la degeneración" de ese sistema económico, que "un día prestó más atención a las ganancias financieras que a la producción" y "empezó a desequilibrarse".      “El capitalismo que invierte pensando en que todos accedan al producto que se produce, ese es el mejor capitalismo”, aseguró y exhortó a "construir otra sociedad” y una “economía más solidaria, que termine con esa lógica de la meritocracia", por la cual "el rico más mediocre tiene más posibilidades que el más brillante de los pobres".      En ese sentido, advirtió que la “economía no es una ciencia exacta", sino "una ciencia humanista que nació para distribuir mejor la riqueza entre los hombres” y garantizó que su gobierno trabajará para que "rápidamente la economía se ponga en marcha" una vez que se haya superado la emergencia sanitaria causada por la pandemia de coronavirus, como ocurrió a partir del 2003 tras la crisis social y económica del 2001.      Entre las prioridades, Fernández marcó la necesidad de "volver a poner la educación, la ciencia y la tecnología en el lugar que le corresponde" porque, dijo, esas herramientas son "el futuro del país", y también en generar "más trabajo para la construcción" y el desarrollo de las fábricas.      "Poco a poco vamos a recuperar la normalidad, pero ya no será la normalidad que conocimos; el mundo de hoy ya no es el mundo de marzo pasado", advirtió y agradeció al gobernador Zamora por su “afecto y cariño”.      “Querido Presidente, Dr Alberto Fernández, bienvenido a Santiago del Estero!!! Un orgullo recibirte aquí, en esta Madre de Ciudades, en el año del Bicentenario de nuestra Autonomía Provincial!!!”, escribió poco antes del inicio del acto el gobernador a través de su cuenta de la red social Facebook.      En la ciudad capital, Fernández recorrió las obras de ampliación de colectores y redes cloacales, que beneficiará a 37.600 habitantes directos y a 180 mil indirectos, con una cobertura del 100 por ciento de los desagües cloacales y una inversión estimada de 2.267 millones de pesos.      Después, recorrió la Escuela del Centenario, cuya puesta en valor requirió una inversión de 226 millones de pesos, y cuyas aulas, patio y microestadio fueron refaccionados y ampliados integralmente.      El Ministerio de Obras Públicas de la Nación realiza éstas y otras obras en Santiago del Estero por una inversión total de 9.893 millones de pesos, que incluirá la reactivación y finalización de dos obras hídricas que permitirán el acceso al agua potable a más de 80 mil habitantes.      También activará cuatro obras viales -que serán finalizadas en 2022- y trabajos de infraestructura social en 18 municipios, que generarán 1.300 puestos de trabajo local en el marco del Plan Nacional Argentina Hace.      Tras su visita a Santiago del Estero, el presidente Fernández emprendió viaje a Tucumán, donde tenía en agenda varias actividades con el gobernador Juan Manzur.
