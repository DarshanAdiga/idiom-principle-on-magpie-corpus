A lot of people can say they love their home town. But few are lucky enough to be able to say they supported it the way Antonio (Tony) Izzi Jr. did.
   
 Izzi, who died this week at age 90, dedicated nearly his entire adult life to Shelby, helping start or secure money needed for multiple community organizations and projects.
   
 "He was a quiet giant in Cleveland County, and he loved Shelby," said Allen Langley, a longtime friend of Izzi. "He had a very deep love of his family, and he wanted to make Shelby a better and safer place for them."
   
 Born in Shelby in 1930, Izzi was one of nine children raised by a couple of immigrants from Viticuso, Italy. Almost from the word go the Izzi family had an impact on Shelby. They were one of six families who joined together to found Saint Mary's Catholic Church. Izzi spent his formative years working at his family's business,Tony's Ice Cream, on South Lafayette Street. The business was known for having a policy of giving free ice cream to anyone in uniform or any kid too poor to buy their own.
   
 He briefly left home to attend college at Wofford and to serve in the Korean War, but returned home in the '50s to start his own family with his wife, Mickey. Two years after he came back to Shelby, Izzi, along with his boss Hoyt Bailey and Jack Schweppe, then plant manager of PPG, started an effort to bring a Boys Club - now the Boys and Girls Club - to Cleveland County.
   
 The club started at a house on West Sumter Street, where the Shelby club still sits, and Izzi was an instrumental part of raising the money the club needed to get its own building.
   
 "In '69 they started a campaign to build a building, and Tony was instrumental in raising $100,000 to build that building," said Jack Weller, president of the Boys and Girls Club. "Tony was one of nine children and his family came from Italy. In 1943 his father got his citizenship, and one of the things I think Tony felt strongly was children need an opportunity to grow up in a place where they are safe and they have adults who are mentoring them and giving them the values they need to succeed in life."
   
 The Boys and Girls Club would end up being a defining part of Izzi's contributions to the city. Even after leaving the board of directors, he remained a regular figure at the club. A few years ago Izzi was recognized by the national Boys and Girls Club organization for 50-plus years of service.
   
 Nearly four decades ago Izzi came up with an idea for a repeatable fundraiser for the club, raffling off a car. The club sells tickets for $100 each for the raffle, and the day of the raffle it hosts a small auction to raise money for the club.
   
 In 2020 the fundraiser made more than $40,000 for the club.
   
 In 2014, after the Boys and Girls Club came up with a plan for a half-million dollar renovation to the gym at Turning Point Academy in exchange for the ability to use it after hours, Izzi lobbied wealthy donors for sums in the thousands of dollars to support the project.
   
 "What is unique in my mind is he joined in 1959 on the board and up until even this year he was active," said Weller. "He would come by and just stop and see what was going on. Most board members don't come back to a charity and ask 'what can I do to help?' or 'what are you working on?' and he was that kind of person.
   
 In addition to his work with the Boys and Girls Club, Izzi was also active in the local Rotary Club, where he boasted 39 years of perfect attendance and contributed more than $2,000 to various projects and causes. He was also a leader in an effort to get posters claiming "In God We Trust" in every classroom in Cleveland County.
   
 He also led efforts to get the train at Shelby City Park up running again. The depot for which is now named for his late wife.

Regina Bento Sequeira, a 59-year-old lawyer and candidate for the municipal elections in Brazil, which holds the first round on November 15, poses for a picture in Rio de Janeiro, on November 11, 2020. - After losing eight elections, Sequeira came up with a plan to win a city council seat in Brazil: she reinvented herself as a superhero, "Captain Chloroquine." The name -- which will actually appear on the ballot for the country's local elections on Sunday -- is a nod to her political idol, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who hails chloroquine as a wonder drug against COVID-19 despite a slate of studies finding it is ineffective.
