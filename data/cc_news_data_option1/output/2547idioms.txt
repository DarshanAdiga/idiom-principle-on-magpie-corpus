Thursday night was special for US 30 Speedway as it was the first time it was allowed to open its grandstands to 75% capacity after being limited to just 50% most of the season.
 It also was just the second time this season that weather didn't cut the night short as six drivers claimed feature wins.
 Fans were also treated to new additions on the concession menu, including Jed's Backstretch BBQ.
 US 30 finished the night with the feature races, but not without Mother Nature teasing the drivers with on and off light rain for a majority of the night.

Before facing workplace disruption, Chinese businesses and Western business with trans-Pacific operations are wise to get ahead of the curve. This involves rethinking corporate policies and integrating a corporate culture that prioritizes gender equality in corporate practices. Often, these organizations work with liaisons who can help to bridge cultural gaps and ensure that company standards are at or above local and state level laws in the U.S., many of which set a high bar for the protection of women in the workplace. However, the trend towards greater gender equality is global, and international businesses will see meaningful benefits as they move toward gender equity at every level of their operations.

 Sometimes a program sounds like such a feel-good no-brainer that it doesn't get the scrutiny it needs before it's rolled out the door.
 The Canada Student Service Grant program, which connects students who need work with charities that need labour, is a textbook case.
 Last week, the federal government announced that it had outsourced the administration of this $912-million pandemic relief program for student volunteers to WE Charity.
 The fact that the prime minister's wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, is a well- known volunteer ambassador for WE isn't a great look for the government. But that's the least of this program's problems. The design itself is deeply flawed.
 The program allows eligible post-secondary students and recent graduates to apply for up to $5,000 for 500 hours of volunteering.
 The very definition of volunteering is to help others without being paid. That's why it's called volunteering, not working.
 So if volunteers are essentially being paid an hourly wage, as they are under this program, are they still volunteers?
 This degree of line-blurring raises serious concerns about whether the program will harm the charitable sector more than help it.
 On top of the problematic suggestion that young people need a financial incentive in order to volunteer, this service-grant doesn't even pay minimum wage anywhere in the country. It works out to just $10 an hour.
 Worse still is the possibility that some organizations that might have hired students to work this summer or fall will replace those jobs with volunteer hours under this no-cost labour option.
 Canadians may never get clear answers on what the student grant program actually achieves and what unintended consequences come with it since the government's decision to outsource its administration to a third party is quite likely to reduce oversight and scrutiny.
 It makes little sense to outsource a service-grant program to a charitable organization in the first place. It makes even less sense to do it without a competitive bidding process.
 According to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, federal bureaucrats decided that WE was "the best and only organization" in Canada with the national connections to run the program.
 That seems particularly ridiculous in light of the fact that WE itself sought to outsource the work of connecting with organizations looking for volunteers to yet another charity, Volunteer Canada.
 Such a haphazard design and delivery of a program originally announced back in April suggests the government didn't really know what to do to help the charitable sector, which is facing financial disaster with vital fund-raising events cancelled because of the pandemic and regular donations hard to come by.
 But opting for a poorly designed, feel-good program is no way to treat more than $900 million in taxpayers' dollars.
 The charitable sector needs financial assistance to weather the pandemic. Students need paid work or assistance to pay for tuition and living expenses if they can't find work. This program addresses neither of those significant problems particularly well.
 When a national organization like Volunteer Canada decides not to participate in a program to promote volunteering, that should have been a significant alarm bell for the government and prompted it to rethink this program.
 "Volunteering can be a fantastic way to build skills, make contacts or just give back," Trudeau said in April when he first announced plans to provide volunteer grants to students who couldn't find work because of COVID-19.
 He was right about the merits of volunteering. But the program his government unveiled doesn't promote that. Instead, it turns volunteering into yet another underpaid labour pool.
 That's not the sort of "national service" Canada should be promoting.

 The sport likely couldn’t have kept it under wraps in this day and age, nor should it have tried to.

There was overzealousness, myself included. We live and learn. And this outcome was so very positive.

Jailed without trial when Hong Kong was a British colony, former underground communist Lau Man-shing says he fears a new generation of dissidents could suffer a similar fate once Beijing imposes its new national security law.
 Now 91, Lau was among a group of prominent dissidents held in an unofficial detention facility by Britain during leftist riots that swept Hong Kong in 1967.
 At the time Lau was a loyal supporter of China's Communist Party and a committed anti-colonial activist.
 Five decades on, he yearns for democracy, convinced the city's inhabitants swapped one authoritarian master for another after the 1997 handover to China.
 "Many people used to believe the promise made by Beijing that Hong Kong will gradually and eventually get universal suffrage," Lau told AFP.
 "But Beijing is asserting more and more control over Hong Kong and is wielding the greatest force to suppress opposing voices."
 Faced with growing popular unrest, Beijing on Tuesday imposed a sweeping security law on Hong Kong, according to local media reports.
 In an unprecedented move, the anti-subversion legislation was written in Beijing, bypassing semi-autonomous Hong Kong's legislature.
 The law is a response to months of huge and often violent pro-democracy protests.
 The last time Hong Kong went through similar political tumult, Lau was at the very centre.
 Fuelled by resentment of colonial rule and inspired by the Cultural Revolution unfolding in China, the 1967 riots left 51 dead.
 What started as a labour dispute in an era of poverty and corruption became large-scale street battles.
 The protesters initially had some popular appeal.
 But public opinion turned against them when leftist bombs killed dozens -- including two children -- and a prominent anti-communist radio host was burned alive in his car.
 Britain responded with a slew of emergency decrees, banning protests and many leftist publications.
 During the unrest's early stages, Lau led a strike at the Water Supplies Department, where he worked as an inspector.
 He was one of 52 protest leaders rounded up and held without charge in a facility that came to be known as "the white house" because of the colour of its walls.
 Known only by his inmate number 459, he spent 13 months there until his sudden release.
 "I never knew when it was going to end," he recalled.
 Lau said he was never tortured and that conditions were better than the more lurid descriptions given by former inmates who have remained loyal to Beijing.
 "The guards there were all local Hong Kong people who were rather polite to us," he said.
 On release, Lau felt abandoned by the Hong Kong leftist groups who distrusted him because he refused to say he was tortured, and stopped helping him after he lost his well-paid civil service job.
 The last straw for Lau -- who was born in Beijing in 1929 and fled with his family to Hong Kong -- came in 1970 when his older sister died during the purges of the Cultural Revolution.
 The same movement he had sacrificed his liberty and career for had come for his family.
 "My heart aches still now," Lau said.
 \- 'Quelling resistance' -
 Earlier this month the South China Morning Post quoted government sources saying they were mulling whether to set up dedicated detention facilities for national security cases, modelled on the "white house" of colonial rule.
 Now frail and reliant on a wheelchair, Lau said he felt the radicalism of his youth was caused by "being deceived by the Chinese communists and blinded by the Hong Kong leftists".
 Many current pro-democracy protesters have also embraced confrontations with police and more violent tactics.
 Lau said he felt Hong Kongers had been left with little choice after years of peaceful protests achieved little from Beijing.
 "People broke a lot of things but what other means were they left?" he asked, describing the current crop of protesters as "informed and educated citizens fighting for universal values".
 Beijing, he said, "wants to quell resistance for once and for all".
 "But will Hong Kong become quiet and stable afterwards? Will Hong Kong people become obedient under suppression? I don't think so."

While many things have been rescheduled or canceled altogether due to the coronavirus pandemic, a day at the beach may be your only option to beat the heat this summer. In Fergus Falls, Pebble Lake Beach has seen a plethora of community members enjoying a swim in the lake, a few casts with the fishing rod and even kayaks have made it out onto the waters.
 But while the beach is open to the public, Fergus Falls recreation coordinator Pam Muxfeldt wants to remind the public that the beach will be open but it is “swim at your own risk.”
 “We have no lifeguards this year,” Muxfeldt said. “We had to make a decision early as we contract with the YMCA to provide lifeguards. With so many things unknown, we weren’t even sure we were going to be able to open the beach.”
 In a typical year, lifeguards would be manning their stations in the middle of June. One of the issues that lifeguards faced this year was that they could not get certified due to their certification classes being canceled. So rather than close down, the recreation department decided to keep the beach open.
 It has also been a very popular spot as families and those looking for a swim are finding different forms of recreation to enjoy. With that in mind, the city staff recently opened up the restrooms at the beach and established a cleaning protocol for the beach. Muxfeldt was asked if any of the docks that are available in the swimming area will return but was unsure if they would be put in this year.
 Earlier in June, there was confusion on whether the beach was open or not due to city crews clearing trees and brush from the area. Like all city parks, Muxfeldt stated that the beach had not closed and community members are responsible for their own safety.
 Even though the beach is without lifeguards, people are happy to have a public beach to visit.
 “Of the folks we’ve talked to, people have been really happy that the beach is open,” Muxfeldt said.

Australia and Zimbabwe have agreed to postpone three one-day internationals in August because of the difficulty of putting on the series while the new coronavirus pandemic continues, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Tuesday. Zimbabwe were due to play the first match at a venue yet to be determined in the far north of Australia on August 9 with a further clash three days later and a final fixture in Townsville on August 15. CA said in a statement that the decision was mutually agreed and that they remained committed to playing the series on "alternative dates".
 "While we are disappointed to postpone the series, CA and (Zimbabwe Cricket) agree that in the best interest of players, match officials, volunteers as well as our fans, this is the most practical and sensible decision," said CA's Nick Hockley.
 Australia last played an international match on March 13, when they beat New Zealand behind closed doors at the Sydney Cricket Ground just before the novel coronavirus outbreak forced the shutdown of all sport.
 England's director of cricket Ashley Giles said last week that he was "quietly confident" Australia would agree to play a one-day series in Britain in September.

"There is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations and in effect there are dissenting opinions from some in the intelligence community with regards to the veracity of what's being reported and the veracity of the underlying allegations continue to be evaluated," McEnany said.
 The intelligence assessments came amid Trump's push to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan and suggested Russia was making overtures to militants as the U.S. and the Taliban held talks to end the long-running war. The assessment was first reported by The New York Times, then confirmed to The Associated Press by American intelligence officials and two others with knowledge of the matter.
 While Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn't new, officials said Russian operatives became more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012. Russian operatives are said to have met with Taliban leaders in Doha, Qatar, and Afghanistan; however, it's unknown if the meetings were to discuss bounties.
 The officials the AP spoke to said the intelligence community has been investigating an April 2019 attack on an American convoy that killed three U.S. Marines after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they traveled back to Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan.
 Three other U.S. service members were wounded in the attack, along with an Afghan contractor. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. The officials the AP spoke to also said they were looking closely at insider attacks — sometimes called "green-on-blue" incidents — from 2019 to determine if they are also linked to Russian bounties.
 In early 2020, members of the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group, known to the public as SEAL Team Six, raided a Taliban outpost and recovered roughly $500,000. The recovered funds further solidified the suspicions of the American intelligence community that the Russians had offered money to Taliban militants and linked associations.
 One official said the administration discussed several potential responses, but the White House has yet to authorize any step.
 The intelligence officials told the AP that Trump was briefed on the bounty matter earlier this year; Trump denied that, tweeting Sunday neither he nor Vice President Mike Pence had been briefed. Trump tweeted Sunday night he was just told intelligence officials didn't report the information to him because they didn't find it credible.
 The intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter insisted on anonymity to discuss the highly sensitive matter.
 The White House National Security Council wouldn't confirm the assessments but said the U.S. receives thousands of intelligence reports daily that are subject to strict scrutiny.
 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who golfed with Trump on Sunday, tweeted Saturday it's "Imperative Congress get to the bottom of recent media reports that Russian GRU units in Afghanistan have offered to pay the Taliban to kill American soldiers with the goal of pushing America out of the region." GRU is a reference to the Russian military intelligence agency.
 Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House, called for the White House to share more information with Congress, saying, if true, lawmakers need to know "Who did know and when?" and, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, "What has been done in response to protect our forces & hold Putin accountable?"

Amid uncertainty in the academic calendar and downsizing in the industry due to Covid-19, the higher educational institutions in Kashmir had very low placements during the lockdown while research, educational and software companies are now showing some promise in online recruitments as the sectors are unlocking.
 The placement in-charges of universities and other educational institutes of the valley say that the period of lockdown was very bad in terms of placements.
 "Man big brands used to come to our university in tourism, automobiles and banking sectors but since the lockdown the corporate are not showing any interest. Our known brands are not responding and we are still waiting," said Dr Zia-ul-Haq, placement officer of Central University of Kashmir.
 "The question is of stability. Many organizations are laying people off. Campus placements are futuristic and businesses can only recruit when they see a bright outlook. The manufacturing is down, supply chains are disturbed, and transportation is minimum and the future is uncertain," he said.
   
   
 At National Institute of Technology (NIT), Srinagar, two students have been placed online during the lockdown. "We had one placement during lockdown and another student was placed in an oil company in first week of June," said Dr Obbu Chandra Sekhar, head of the Training and Placement Department at NIT Srinagar.
 He said that June was showing some promise after the announcement of unlock. "The things had really slowed down during lockdown but now they are going better. A research based company did online recruitment of five students recently. Five to six more companies are in the pipeline and will announce their results in a week's time," he said.
 All the recruitments are happening online. "Most of these companies are research oriented, software and public sector undertakings," he said.
 At Islamic University of Science and Technology(IUST), Awantipora , an e-commerce organisation is going to hold an online placement drive for recruiting Customer Service Associates this week.
 "We managed to get a few students placed during the lockdown in an online educational company and one student in Apple," said Dr S. Iqbal Querishi, in- charge Career Counselling & Placement Officer of IUST.
 "There is a change now in recruitments. Work from home is the new concept but our 2G internet speeds are hampering the online recruitment process. There is a change in student mindset to target the companies looking for work form home options," he said.
 The students are also scaling up things to improve up their skill sets particularly relating to information technology.
 "The post lockdown period will be more technology oriented and the students have started thinking on those terms. Some common sectors of work from home will be online tuitions, filing tax returns, content writing and the related aspects. We have been attempting to organize online workshops for the students," said Central University of Kashmir's Zia-ul-Haq.
 "Nobody knows where it will end and we can't just wait. The initiative has to be taken," he said.

NATICK - Nearly a dozen ash trees on the downtown common will be cut down due to an Emerald Ash Borer beetle infestation.
 Ten trees will be removed in early July. Nine on the Park Street side of the common are infested and another is likely infested. Other species of trees will be replanted next spring.
 "We're shocked by how quickly it took over," said Jeremy Marsette, public works director.
 Marsette said his staff noticed the trees were slow to bloom this spring, and experts brought in confirmed it was a borer infestation.
 Removal will not prevent the beetle's spread, said Nicole Keleher, forest health program director at the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation Bureau of Forest Fire Control and Forestry; once an infestation is noticed, it is too late to prevent its spread.
 Approximately 3% of Natick's public trees are ash, according to a town memo. It noted many more ash trees are on private property.
 Marsette recommended homeowners who notice that their ash trees are a little sluggish should hire a tree expert.
 A telltale sign of the beetle's presence are small circular holes on the bark, with one side of the hole being flat, Marsette said. Pull back the bark, and burrowing beetles will appear.
 "Once it gets in the tree, that's pretty much it," Marsette said, noting the town's strategy is to contain its spread.
 The beetle arrived in the U.S. from Asia in the early 1990s and was first detected domestically in Michigan in 2002.
 "It's rapidly spreading across the country," Keleher said of the beetle that grows to three-quarters of an inch long, with infestations in 32 states and five Canadian provinces.
 It was first detected in Massachusetts in 2012 in the town of Dalton, and Keleher said its numbers have exploded statewide over the past two years. Last year, the beetle was newly detected in 50 Massachusetts communities.
 The Cape and Islands are the only part in the state where there is no detection, because those areas have small ash tree populations.
 While Keleher said removal won't stop the spread, it's important to take infested trees down quickly, because they become brittle and can topple over.
 Once removed, the trees should be run through a chipper to kill any of the beetle's larvae. That will help prevent the spread into other communities. Marsette said a chipper will be used on the trees taken down in the common, and the chips will be safely removed.
 When the beetle was first detected in Dalton, downed trees could not be moved out of Berkshire County. According to Keleher, Massachusetts is now part of a national quarantine, which means downed trees can be transported throughout the state.
 Movement outside Massachusetts is determined by regulations in neighboring states.
 Emamectin benzoate is a pesticide used by state forestry officials at the point of early damage detection. It's the most effective approach to kill the beetle , Keleher said, based on studies by the United States Department of Agriculture and U.S. Forest Service.
 The pesticide is injected into a tree's base, but it may not be effective for trees in urban communities because their bases tend to be damaged by municipal equipment or citizen recreation.
 Tiny parasitic wasps, provided by the United States Department of Agriculture, is another method used by state forestry crews to kill the beetles. That started in 2014, and some are injected in beetle larvae located inside the tree. Others are injected in beetle larvae on the bark.
 The method is being used in 16 Massachusetts sites, and its effectiveness is unclear.
 "It's a slow process. It's challenging to assess," Keleher said. "It doesn't kill all the beetles, but it helps to decrease the population."
 As younger ash trees grow, Keleher said the hope is the wasps injections will slow infestations enough to allow time for natural predators to develop.

We’re very fortunate for that.” But now we needed to learn to fight back, he said. “We must learn to dominate the virus and not let the virus dominate us.”

"The truth of the matter is that there is so much information that has been divulged on this case that everybody, Erin, you all at CNN and all the other media companies are trying to get information," Crump said. "It is important to be transparent.

PLANS to consider operating Mullumbimby’s public pool all year round, and improve its range of services, have progressed.
 Byron Shire Council deputy mayor Sarah Ndiaye brought a notice of motion before Thursday’s ordinary meeting.
 The motion was asking that the council seeks funding from the State Government or another funding body for a feasibility study into a proposed upgrade of the pool.
 Cr Ndiaye has been calling for consideration to be given to turning the Petria Thomas Swimming Pool into a year round, solar-heated facility with a disability access ramp to access the existing 50m pool.
 She’s also called for a children’s splash pool and a rehabilitation or hydrotherapy pool and for the feasibility study to consider a range of water treatment options.
 Cr Ndiaye acknowledged the shire had “hit a very difficult financial situation” in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “I put this motion forward initially to do a feasibility study to make the Petria Thomas swimming pool a year round facility with a lot of community support behind it and it was voted for unanimously,” she said.
 “I’ve been contacted recently by people who work in the carers sector … outraged we have no facility to support people who need to do any rehabilitation.
 “There’s a lot of people that use it for their general mental and physical wellbeing.
 “The NDIS doesn’t provide enough funding for them to travel to Murwillumbah, because of the time included in going there in back, the same with Ballina.”
 She asked if they consider whether there was “any appetite to ask staff to re- look at the budget”.
 Failing that, she asked that they actively seek external funding to upgrade the pool.
 “I’m not asking us to increase our deficit,” Cr Ndiaye said.
 “I am going to remain optimistic that we will be able to get this funding from somewhere else because I know all the fat’s been cut on our budget as it is.
 “These projects are community-building.
 “They increase the health wellbeing and provide a lot of valuable learning activities for young people and options for people who are injured or elderly to get exercise.
 “That needs to be provided year round.”
 Resident Sandra Kessler, who urged councillors to vote for the motion, said members of the community had been “demonstrably moved” by the prospect of having a local hydrotherapy pool.
 The closest pool that meets hydrotherapy standards is at the Tweed Regional Aquatic Centre’s Murwillumbah site.
 “Yes, there’s funding challenges,” Ms Kessler said.
 “But there’s also funding opportunities.
 “And they can be pursued when the costing and research phases are completed.”
 She assured councillors there was “enthusiastic support” for the proposal.
 “Mullumbimby Residents Association endorse and support this project,” she said.
 The motion was unanimously supported.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Fulton County Schools will start its 2020-21 academic year in August with in-person instruction, but a week later than originally planned.
 Also, students will have the option to instead take online classes, but they must spend the entire semester taking in-person or virtual classes unless a second wave of the outbreak requires the district to close schools again.
 “We’re asking any families to make a semester-long commitment for face-to-face or virtual because we have to staff accordingly,” Superintendent Mike Looney said. “Understanding there are always scenarios that pop up, we will work with families to (handle them).”
 Looney made the announcement at the Fulton Board of Education’s special called meeting June 29 at the North Learning Center in Sandy Springs. While the decision to have in-person classes with an online option did not require a board vote, it did provide input on the plan, president Julia Bernath said. Also, the board voted 7-0 to approve amending the 2020-21 calendar so school could start Aug. 17 instead of Aug. 10, as Looney requested to give it more time to prepare.
 As announced at the board’s June 18 meeting, the district has implemented an interim school closure matrix decision strategy that includes criteria on what it would do if one or more schools had COVID-19 cases with its students or staff. At the June 29 meeting, Looney and board members said the plan to start school with in-person instruction could change quickly if state and/or CDC guidelines change.
 “If our data says it is too dangerous to open school, then we will open with scenario number 2, which is universal remote (classes) for all students,” he said, adding the plan was adjusted as late as earlier in the day, when the board had a working retreat.
 Regarding the online classes option, parents can sign up their children through the district’s website (www.fultonschools.org) from June 29 at midnight through July 17 at midnight.
 The Neighbor covered the meeting remotely, and the district has a longstanding policy of not broadcasting the public comment portion of each meeting that has it. But the Neighbor has requested a list of individuals who gave public comments and the topics each one discussed. But based on board members’ comments afterwards, many of those who spoke talked about the district’s impending decision to choose in-person or online instruction or a combination of both.
 Bernath said the public commenters included those both for and against in- person instruction, adding it’s impossible to please everyone with each decision.
 “But as all of our board members have said, the primary goal is for us to have the health and safety of the students in mind, and I have no doubt that Dr. Looney and all of our staff have been working toward those ends,” she said. “This is a developing time.”
 District 1 board member Katha Stuart added, “Can ya’ll believe what we’ve been through the last five or six months? I’ve gotten a lot of comments recently. Those comments have been great, and you raised some questions we had not thought of.”
 Patrick Burke, the district’s chief operating officer, said each school will undergo regular cleaning and will have hand sanitizer and personal protective equipment available to ensure the health and safety of students and staff. Employees will be required to wear masks, and students must wear them while on school buses but will only be strongly encouraged to wear them while on campus.
 “There are a number of things we’re putting in for bus safety,” Burke said. “We’ll have face shields for bus drivers. We’ll be managing where students sit. The idea is to manage where they sit, so we can do contact tracing … (if they contract COVID-19), but it’s also how we sit our students, so we minimize how much they’re passing each other. Not in every instance, but there are other things we must consider, but loading from the back to the front, emptying from the front to the back and the reverse is true on the way home. …
 “Surfaces will be wiped down between the elementary, middle and high school runs. At the end of the route in the evening, we’ll disinfect the buses in a fogging matter. … We do expect to see parents may opt out of riding a bus, and we are, and Mr. Jones will talk about it in a moment, how it will affect school management and school logistics as well. We’ll expect that to have an impact on student drop-off times.”

 The top series raced Saturday and Sunday at Pocono Raceway. In the weekend finale, first and second swapped places with Denny Hamlin edging Kevin Harvick. Saturday marked Harvick’s first victory there, but winning at Pocono is old hat for Hamlin, who tied Jeff Gordon for most victories all time at the track with six.
 One of the more entertaining moments of Sunday’s race belonged to Bubba Wallace, who just barely squeezed between Ryan Preece’s sliding car and the barrier.

WICHITA, Kan. - Legendary former Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder says he misses being on the field but has no interest in returning to the sidelines more than 18 months after wrapping up a Hall of Fame career.
   
 Snyder stepped away in 2018 after 27 seasons on the sidelines that included winning 215 games, reaching 19 bowls and claiming a pair of Big 12 titles. He said he's now mostly at home spending time with his wife and family.
   
 "I don't wake up thinking, 'Boy, do I miss football,'" Snyder told The Wichita Eagle during a recent video conference. "I don't really think about it all that much."
   
 Snyder said that when he first retired in 2005, it took him about half a year to get accustomed to the new role. And though he returned from retirement three years later, it's never bothered him since.
   
 "I can't say that I don't miss being on the field, but it's not something that I think about going back to," Snyder said. "The time has come and passed and I enjoyed it."
   
 Snyder arrived at Kansas State in the fall of 1988, a nondescript offensive coordinator from Iowa who once coached high school swimming before learning under legendary Hawkeyes coach Hayden Fry. During his tenure in Manhattan, which began in the Big Eight, he weathered seismic shifts in college football. Along the way he overcame throat cancer, sent dozens of players to the NFL and gave countless more an opportunity to succeed on and off the field.
   
 Snyder said he still talks to many of his former players and recently made the case for Michael Bishop and Darren Sproles to join him in the College Football Hall of Fame
   
 Synder said he's always loved mentoring young players and imparting wisdom. He offered insight to anyone struggling with the unprecedented times we're living through.
   
 "I would like to think that it would be virtually the same," Snyder said. "With all the turmoil that goes on, one thing that stands at the top is the quality of character and the type of person that you are and the value system that you possess."

Overall, however, Asian shares are still on course for a 7per cent decline over the first half of this year, underscoring the severity of the pandemic- sparked losses and the challenges facing investors as global infections continue to rise in a blow to hopes of a quick recovery.
 "Overnight moves in markets were not large but one does get the distinct impression that markets have got it both ways – with equities rallying on rebounding data and bonds rallying on dismal COVID-19 news," said ANZ Research analyst Rahul Khare.
 Indeed, for the second quarter Asia ex-Japan shares were on course for a 17.8per cent gain, which would be the biggest quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2009. Stocks appear to have received an added boost on Tuesday as some investors adjusted positions on the last trading day of the quarter.
 On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.32per cent, the S&P 500 gained 1.47per cent and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.2per cent.
 China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) released Tuesday showed factory activity in the world's second-largest economy grew for a fourth straight month in June. China's services sector PMI also expanded at a faster pace compared to the previous month.
 A recent resurgence in coronavirus infections had led some investors to question the strength of a rebound in global economic activity.
 The swing in sentiment between hopes and fears has kept markets on edge.
 The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was little changed at 0.6348per cent in Asia as traders braced for U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Thursday, which is forecast to show an improving labour market.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Monday said the outlook for the world's biggest economy is "extraordinarily uncertain" and signalled more monetary stimulus may be necessary, which could limit gain in yields.
 Confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide rose past 10 million and deaths surpassed 500,000 on over the weekend.
 The bulk of new cases were reported in the United States and Latin America, stoking fears that the outbreak could stall economic recoveries just as lockdowns begin to ease.
 In currency markets, the dollar held onto gains against the yen and the Swiss franc as the recent increase in coronavirus infections supported safe-haven demand for the greenback.
 In the onshore market, the yuan rose slightly to 7.0685 against the dollar.
 U.S. crude fell 0.48per cent to US$39.51 a barrel, while Brent crude slipped 0.31per cent to US$41.58 per barrel, weighed by concerns about oversupply after Libya cited progress in resuming oil exports.

Andhra Pradesh Police performed the last rites of a woman who died during childbirth as the locals refused to cremate her due to superstition.
 Lavanya (23) was admitted to Nandyal Government Hospital for her delivery. However, she died on Saturday morning. Her relatives took her body to the village on the same day but some villagers stopped them from performing final rites of the woman. They felt that the dead body of a woman with a baby child in her womb is not good for the villagers," said Rudravaram police station Sub Inspector Ramamohan Reddy.
 He further said, "As the villagers had refused to allow her family members to conduct Lavanya's last rites, her family members took her body to a forest area near Pedda Kambuluru village and tied the body to a tree and left the place.
 "The body was later found by some locals from nearby villages who then informed the police on Sunday at around 7 pm. On Monday morning, the police performed the last rites in the presence of her family members and local Mandal Revenue Officer (MRO)," Reddy added.
   
   
 The police have booked 15 persons on the charges of not allowing Lavanya's family to perform her last rites in the village. Cases are filed under sections 259, 270, 297 and 504 IPC.
