India itself is involved in terrorism all over the world. In the report of the European organization EU DisinfoLab, where the role of Indian terrorism in Pakistan is clarified, it has also exposed the absurd propaganda against Pakistan and China. No matter how much India willingly rejects this report, declaring these allegations to be false, it cannot be acquitted in any way. The above said European organization is independent and neutral, and has nothing to do with Pakistan, there is no question of its being under the influence of Pakistan, if there was any truth in India's position then it would have taken this European organization to the International Court of Justice, India's mere denial of the report cannot prove its innocence.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Idaho Gov. Brad Little has proclaimed December, “Health Care Worker Appreciation Month,” recognizing the work care providers are doing in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Little made the proclamation on Wednesday, calling health care workers heroes, and urging Idaho residents to show gratitude by wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding gatherings with non- household members and maintaining social distancing. Idaho is currently 10th in the nation for new cases per capita. One in every 173 people in Idaho tested positive for coronavirus infection in the past week, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. At least 124,000 Idaho residents have been infected with coronavirus so far.

Nutritional advice can be confusing. Getting a definitive answer regarding whether any particular food is good or bad for you is like trying to pin Jell-O to a wall with a red-hot branding iron.
 For instance, there once was a time when nutrition authorities implied that coffee is bad for every lifeform on the planet. Java, they said, could engender any number of maladies including noxious halitosis, felonious foot odor, and widespread outbreaks of speed-talking which, in turn, caused spittle spatter to become a major public health concern.
 We were given the impression that all liquid coffee should be poured down the drain, except that doing so might severely damage the sewer system. You should no sooner drink espresso than you would chug paint thinner.

Replacing the fiduciary rule has long been an industry goal. Before assuming his current role, Secretary of Labor Scalia, was a private attorney who led the lawsuit that vacated the Obama-era fiduciary rule. That lawsuit was filed by a slew of business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, SIFMA and FSI.
 SIFMA said it welcomed the new Labor Department rules and the nimbleness they provide advisors and brokers.
 “The exemption is a step forward as it will encourage a variety of investment advice approaches and it will provide retirement investors with the services they seek. SIFMA supports permitting financial professionals to provide investment advice in a flexible fashion,” SIFMA CEO Kenneth Bentsen said in a statement.
 AARP, which was a supporter of the Obama-era fiduciary rule, criticized the new rules for being too permissive of conflicts of interest.
 “This rule is both harmful and contrary to the letter and spirit of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act,” Nancy LeaMond, chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a statement.
 The department’s rulemaking becomes effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - The COVID-19 vaccine became available for selected health care workers in Arkansas and Mississippi starting Monday.Since then, thousands of doses have arrived in those states.In Tennessee, where the number of coronavirus cases is skyrocketing, neither hospitals nor the state have administered a single dose.The Mississippi and Arkansas Departments of Health have each received 25,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.Tennessee has received one tray, a total of 975 doses, according to the Department of Health.In a press release, the state said it would “hold” those doses as “an emergency backup supply should any receiving hospital’s supply be damaged.”Selected hospitals will begin receiving the vaccine Thursday. Not from the state but from Pfizer directly, which is one reason for the delay, according to a Tennessee Department of Health spokesperson.“This will allow hospitals to begin administering the vaccine as soon as it arrives,” said TDH spokesperson Bill Christian.The fact that the arrival date in Tennessee lags behind Arkansas and Mississippi has drawn criticism from lawmakers and doctors alike, especially as Tennessee’s coronavirus case numbers are skyrocketing.“We are sitting on these vaccines that people that want them could utilize and take right now,” said state Rep. Antonio Parkinson, a Democrat from Shelby County.When the doses arrive Thursday, priority will be given to areas in the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index; communities that are more vulnerable to the affects of a disaster, like a pandemic.Shelby, Lauderdale, Haywood, Hardeman and McNairy counties all fall into that category.The WMC Action News Five Investigators wanted to see how many doses will go to those vulnerable communities so we asked for a list of the hospitals receiving the vaccine.Our request was denied.Copyright 2020 WMC.

It is worth mentioning that Southampton could have briefly gone to the top of the Premier League last night if they had beaten Arsenal, so we were expecting another tough game at the Emirates.
 So when the ex-Gunner Theo Walcott put the visitors in front, we expected heads to drop, and pondered the fact that we hadn’t scored an open-play goal in over 12 hours, but the lads didn’t give up and in fact seemed to raise their game in search of the equaliser.
 Just 7 minutes after the break, Aubameyang finally got his name on the scoresheet and it looked like we were back in the game, until, as usual, disaster struck when Gabriel was given his marching orders after two quick yellow cards.
 But despite our usual setback, Arteta was pleased that we held on to a point, only our second in 6 League games. The boss told Arsenal.com: “Considering the fact that we played 35 minutes with 10 men, we have to take the point because we showed some resilience and character to hang in there for so long against a really dangerous team.
 “But at the same time we’re disappointed because we came back after conceding the goal, we showed how much we wanted it, created some situations and at half-time we corrected a few things. We came back really strong in the game, scored a goal and then when we had the best moments, we shot ourselves in the foot. It obviously made it really hard.
 “It’s very difficult to compete in this league when you play for such a long period with 10 men. When you’re struggling for the results, it makes it even more complicated but I think that the boys stood up for it and again showed a lot of character and resilience. They never gave up. After 1-0 I was worried because after this moment, you can start to see players hiding but they did the complete opposite.”
 So Arteta is still seeing the pòsitives in our play depite the lack of points to show for it. Let us hope that some confidence has returned to the side and we can start pulling away from the relegation zone very quickly…

LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Bitcoin set a fresh all-time high on Thursday, after rising 6.5% to $22,765 by 0833 GMT, just a day after smashing the $20,000 milestone for the first time.
 The world's highest profile crypto-currency has gained more than 175% this year, buoyed by demand from larger investors attracted to its potential for quick gains and perceived inflation-hedging qualities.
 Smaller coin ethereum which often moves in tandem with bitcoin, was trading 1.75% higher.
 The recent bitcoin rally has been driven in part by increasing expectations it will soon become a mainstream payment method, after shedding a poor public image for opacity among yield-hungry investors and risk-averse consumers.
 Yang Li, Chief Growth Officer at digital foreign exchange platform Ziglu said modern personal money apps were at the forefront of ensuring easy, safe, fast access to cryptocurrency.
 "Wider adoption will grow the value of bitcoin even more, this is just the start," Li said. (Reporting By Sinead Cruise, editing by Rachel Armstrong)

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials say they’re actively negotiating for additional purchases of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine after passing up a chance to lock in a contract this summer since it was still unclear how well the shots would work.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and special adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui also told reporters Wednesday that Pfizer had been unable to commit to a firm delivery date. Azar called that “the core issue.”There was no immediate comment from the company, whose CEO Albert Bourla told CNN this week it is “working very collaboratively” with the government to deliver additional vaccine through the federal Operation Warp Speed. That’s a White House-backed, taxpayer-funded effort to quickly develop coronavirus vaccines and treatments.Meanwhile, the FDA said late Wednesday that some Pfizer vaccine vials may contain more than the standard five doses. The FDA statement followed reports from hospital and pharmacy staff that some vials are apparently overfilled. The FDA advised health professionals to use every full dose possible “given the public health emergency.” The agency said it is communicating with Pfizer about the issue.The Trump administration has come under scathing criticism from congressional Democrats after news leaked out last week about the missed opportunity to secure more vaccine.“We are concerned the failure to secure an adequate supply of vaccines will needlessly prolong the COVID-19 pandemic in this country, causing further loss of life and economic devastation,” a group of senators led by Patty Murray of Washington and Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote HHS. “We fear this is yet another instance in which the Trump administration’s failure to develop a comprehensive national vaccines plan in a timely manner could jeopardize efforts to get people vaccinated and ultimately end this pandemic.”Azar sought to rebut that concern Wednesday, saying that pending contracts with a number of manufacturers will ensure enough vaccine for all Americans by around the middle of next year. A second vaccine from Moderna appears headed for Food and Drug Administration approval within days, and more vaccine candidates are advancing through clinical trials.But the one from Pfizer and German pharmaceutical BioNTech was first into the arms of Americans, raising hopes of taming a pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 people in the U.S. and hobbled much of the national economy. Health care workers and nursing home residents top the list as local TV stations across the country are broadcasting scenes of the first vaccinations. Some polls show skepticism about getting vaccinated may be easing.After early failures with testing, Trump administration officials are hoping to write a very different ending with vaccines. Operation Warp Speed has financed the development, manufacture and distribution of millions of doses, with the goal of providing a free vaccine to any American who wants one.Pfizer was not as closely involved with Operation Warp Speed as other manufacturers, preferring to retain control over its own development and manufacturing. But the government did enter into a contract to buy 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the first of which were shipped this week.At issue is the purchase of another 100 million doses for delivery as early as the middle of next year.“We are engaged in active negotiations,” said Azar.Slaoui, a world-renowned vaccine scientist who is helping lead the federal effort, said the goal all along was to have several promising vaccines in development, with taxpayers assuming the financial risk if any given vaccine failed to secure FDA approval.“We built a portfolio of vaccines to ensure one of them at least would make it to the finish line,” he said.Back in the summer, “it wouldn’t make sense to preorder more from a manufacturer before we knew how a vaccine worked.”Although initial signals were positive about the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the full FDA review did not take place until earlier this month.Slaoui and Azar also said that because of Operation Warp Speed’s arm’s length relationship with Pfizer, officials had less of a window into the company’s manufacturing and any potential problems that might develop.“We of course would welcome having another 100 million doses,” said Slaoui, adding that it’s his expectation that negotiations with Pfizer will be successful.With at least one other vaccine appearing headed for approval, they’re already talking about a surplus that could be sent out to the rest of the world.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

THE threat posed to Christmas celebrations by Covid-19 was brought home last night as nearly 400 children and teachers were told to restrict their movements until December 30. With just under a week to go until most schools break for the holidays, Ireland has experienced its first major outbreak of the virus in an educational setting.Health officials have ordered that all pupils and staff at a school in the constituency of Education Minister Norma Foley be tested for Covid. They have also been told to stay at home for two weeks, including Christmas Day.The development is likely to be careful watched school principals and parents around the country.In recent days the Department of Education resisted attempts by a number of schools to close in order to reduce the risk of infection ahead of next week&rsquo;s break.A total of 17 cases have so far been detected at Scoil Mhuire Killorglin, a mixed primary school of 386 pupils have been recorded so far &ldquo;and contact tracing is ongoing&rdquo; according to the HSE.Local TD Michael Healy Rae said that this incident should act as a wake up call.&ldquo;It brings home how careful we have to be. This will make us buck up and realise things are not normal,&rdquo; he told the Irish Independent.In a letter to parents, the Department of Public Health said it &ldquo;has been uncommon to see an outbreak of this scale among a school population&rdquo; in Ireland so far.School management had implemented and continued to implement appropriate Covid control measures. And cases and close contacts have been isolating.&ldquo;Following further review today, based on current evidence the decision has been taken to extend testing to the remainder of the school population, (children and staff),&rdquo; the letter states.Any child not previously identified as a case or a close contact is now advised to restrict their movements until Wednesday, December 30,&rdquo; the letter advises. The children are being referred for two tests, a number of days apart, by the HSE.Restricted movement means &ldquo;the child does not go to school&rdquo;, the letter says.They are also to stay away from older people and not have visitors in homes.In a statement last night, the HSE confirmed that parents of children at a school in the south of the country have been told that their children should not attend school, a decision made after a &ldquo;public health risk assessment of the school&rdquo;The spokesperson confirmed that both staff and students have been asked to restrict their movements up until December 30.The spokesperson said that when a coronavirus case is identified, public health engages in contact tracing.&ldquo;Public Health professionals will also discuss the matter directly with the educational facility if deemed necessary, undertaking a public health risk assessment. Recommended measures, including mass testing and any exclusions of other pupils or staff members, or closures are made at this point. Responses and recommendations for each facility may well differ, depending on the circumstances identified by public health.&rdquo;Meanwhile, in a statement, the Department of Educations said that it does not comment on individual cases.It said that according to public health guidelines, when a case is identified in a school, contact is made with the school and risk assessment is carried out, which &ldquo;takes into account all of the evidence in relation to the particular circumstances of the school and the advice provided is based on this.&rdquo;The school then must follow public health advice and close if they must. &ldquo;While the Department understands that schools and principals have been working tirelessly through these unprecedented times, it is important that the advice and expertise of public health leads decisions about closure and other measures schools need to take,&rdquo; said the spokesperson.&ldquo;Schools will close for the Christmas holidays on Tuesday 22 December and will remain closed until 6 January.&rdquo;Elsewhere, Claremorris Boys National School in Mayo had 16 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last three weeks.However, while principal Mark Loftus and the board of management decided to close the school and switch to online learning last Friday, the Department of Education overruled the decision and directed the school to remain open.Meanwhile, a special Cabinet meeting has been scheduled for December 29 in light of the steadily growing number of coronavirus cases.

Another Grand Slam title in 2021 would also make him the oldest man ever to win a major.
 Ken Rosewall, who was 37 years and 67 days old when he won the Australian Open in 1972, currently boasts that distinction.
 If Federer is to break that mark then Wimbledon, where he has been victorious eight times, remains the most likely stage.
 World number one Novak Djokovic will be most people's choice for a ninth Australian Open, whenever the tournament, still under a coronavirus shadow, takes place.
 Federer admits that the 2021 Grand Slam season opener in Melbourne may come too soon as his recovery from two knee surgeries takes longer than expected.
 "It's a race against time. Of course it would help if I had a little bit more time. But it's going to be close," Federer said at a weekend awards ceremony in Switzerland.
 "I would have hoped that I'd be at a 100 per cent already in October. But I'm not at this level even today. It will be a close call for the Australian Open."
 Nadal will be favourite to win again at Roland Garros where he has 100 wins and just two losses in 15 years.
 Federer is a five-time US Open winner but the last of his titles in New York came in 2008.
 Since then Nadal has been champion four times and Djokovic on three occasions.

Looking back now, fourteen years later, given the very different lens that I view the world through today, I acknowledge that a lack of diversity at the upper levels of the staff may have contributed to Leonard experiencing the lack of sensitivity that he describes. I have been committed to improving upon this issue with every project I pursue. I remember Leonard fondly and wish him well."

Sloppy and listless, unable to take advantage of late-game opportunities, and having to deal with a suddenly mercurial quarterback who quite obviously had seen his own picture on the cover of Sports Illustrated, the Wildcats lost to a barely average visiting BYU team. (BYU would go on to lose home games that season to Utah State and—gulp!—Northern Illinois.)

Are tanks obsolete? Not by a long shot. The Syrian army operates the same variants of the T-72 and has been successful to discover its importance on urban battlegrounds. Military commanders know that tanks thrive in cover and are vulnerable against artillery fire and surgical/carpet bombing. This has been common knowledge even between Wehrmacht field marshals because the Panzer V “Panther” that preyed on allied armor due to its superior sloped frontal armor and its 75mm high velocity cannon had weak top armor plating and was easily wiped out by allied bombing runs. So, as long as the fighting occurs in urban grounds and/or state-of-the-art surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems are guarding the airspace, armor can be highly effective for holding down or taking strategic points. As the father of mechanized warfare, Guderian, once said, “If the tank succeeds, victory follows.”

"At half-time we moved the pieces around a little bit, but overall the game was always under control and I am very pleased with the performance.
 "The changes were to find counter-attack situations, which we did immediately, but with Gio's [Giovani Lo Celso] yellow card and the incredible pressure these guys on the touchline [Liverpool staff] put on the officials, I was afraid of the yellow card and I had to take him off."
 Liverpool have now won all seven of their Premier League games at Anfield this season, where they are unbeaten in 66 top-flight matches, while Mourinho has not won away against Jurgen Klopp in six attempts in all competitions (D2 L4),
 The result moves Liverpool above Spurs to the top of the table and Klopp is in no doubt his side deserved maximum points.
 "A good game against a counter-attacking monster and with the possession we had we did incredibly well," he said. "Yes, they have scored a goal, had two chances, but apart from that we controlled the game and it is a massively deserved three points and I am happy.
 "It was just a really good game and I am so happy we scored that goal because it felt like 70 per cent of the ball against a top side.
 "Bobby [Firmino], what a header, I am over the moon for him. What a game he played, those movements, he opens up all the other gaps."

TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, Dec 17 (Reuters) - When Abdullah boarded an inflatable boat crammed with fellow migrants in February he thought he would finally reach Europe after braving the dangers of a Sahara crossing and Libya's civil war.
 The 27-year-old from Niger knew the voyage ahead was risky. The Mediterranean waters between Libya and Italy have claimed thousands of lives in recent years as people sought a better life in richer, safer countries.
 After only two hours at sea, naval vessels turned back the small flotilla of smuggling boats, returning Abdullah to the Libyan mainland where he had faced violence and abuse.
 "I cried and cried ... It was terrible to fail after all that hard work," he said.
 Afraid of being detained by police or an armed group, Abdullah asked to be identified by his first name only.
 As the coronavirus pandemic slowed people's movement in the spring, the numbers trying to cross from Libya to Italy dropped. But as the months have worn on, smugglers' rickety vessels have taken to the waves again.
 So far, more than 1,000 people have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2020. That is fewer than last year's 1,800, but fatalities have picked up since October.
 Mediterranean migrant deaths rose from 117 in September to 141 in October and 184 in November, according to the U.N. migration agency.
 The risks migrants take to reach mainland Europe are not only at sea. In Libya, there has been little central authority since the 2011 uprising and armed groups often control the streets in major cities.
 In May, gunmen in the desert city of Mizda abducted 30 migrants in the hope of extracting a ransom, tortured them and slaughtered them when a few tried to fight back.
 SMUGGLERS
 Abdullah was confined to a crowded detention centre in northwest Libya after his abortive attempt to flee, and there was little to eat and barely room to sleep. After two months, a friend bribed a guard and he escaped, he said.
 When Abdullah tried to make the voyage a second time, he was stopped by fighters on his way to the rendezvous and robbed of the money had earned in previous months to pay for his passage.
 He now works as a cleaner in Tripoli, and has given up on another sea crossing.
 Even reaching Libya was a triumph of sorts. After paying a smuggler, Abdullah joined a dozen other migrants in a pick-up truck trundling for days across the desert to the border. They had little water and two passengers died, he said.
 Once inside Libya, he faced the reality of a country at war.
 "There are militias everywhere here. Sometimes I lose hope and I just want to return to Niger. I work very hard then armed people storm my home and take my money," he said.
 In the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, Somali national Abdul Razzaq Yassin is still determined to get to Europe.
 Sick of the insecurity in his hometown of Mogadishu, Yassin left after his father was killed.
 Smugglers helped him cross into Ethiopia and then Sudan before reaching the remote Libyan desert area of Kufra, where he was detained with hundreds of others in an airport hangar.
 Eventually he escaped.
 Several friends have already reached Europe and he is determined to join them, whatever dangers the Mediterranean poses.
 "There's no future at all. I want to go to Europe." (Reporting by Reuters Libya newsroom; Writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by Mike Collett-White)

Benzema, however, showed his class late in the game, restoring Madrid’s lead by heading in a Dani Carvajal cross before rounding off the victory by finishing off a rapid counterattack in added time. The coach was asked if his compatriot was the best French striker ever after the game and he had no doubts. “For me he is the best, because he has spent so long at Real Madrid and he keeps proving himself,” Zidane told a news conference. “He has played over 500 games and scored so many goals. His achievements and honours speak for themselves. For me he is the best, of course.” Benzema has turned into a talismanic figure for Real since Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure in 2018 but has not featured for France since 2015 following an incident involving his then national team mate Mathieu Valbuena.

  AMSTERDAM, Dec 17 (Reuters) - German bond yields edged up in early Thursday trade, ahead of the country's bond issuance outlook for next year.


  After a record level of bond issuance this year, Europe's benchmark bond issuer is expected to raise double the new debt -- at nearly 180 billion euros -- it initially envisaged for 2021.


  Commerzbank analysts expect the release around 0900 GMT.


  German 10-year yields were up one basis point in early trade, at -0.56%, just off one-week highs touched a day earlier.


  "Looking at the underperformance of Bunds versus other developed markets and in particular versus swaps yesterday, it appears that some of that could be also be owed to the market anticipating a significantly higher bond issuance volume of up to EUR280bn," ING analysts told clients.


  Euro zone bond yields led by Germany jumped on Wednesday after better-than- expected business sector data readings for December, which pushed the country's 10-year yield up some 5 basis points, their biggest daily jump in over two weeks.


  "However, much will also depend on the split between short-term money market funding, which was wound down again this quarter, and the longer term bond market," ING analysts said.


  A 50-50 split between the two segments would lead to issuance closer to 240 billion euros, they said.


  Positive risk sentiment on the back of progress on U.S. stimulus, where negotiators were closing in on a $900 billion COVID-19 aid bill, and hopes for a Brexit trade deal probably also hurt safe-haven bonds.


  There was little impact on euro zone bonds from the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, which said it would maintain its current bond-buying policy until significant progress in the U.S. economic recovery is made. That led to only a modest steepening of the Treasury yield curve.


  The gap between U.S. and German 10-year yields was at 149 basis points, just off its lowest in nearly two weeks.
