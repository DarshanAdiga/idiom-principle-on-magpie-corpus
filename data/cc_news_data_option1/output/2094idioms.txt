The governing body that writes the rules for the majority of high school athletics in the United States has released guidelines that provide a road map for a return to sports amid the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 The document from the National Federation of State High School Associations lists precautionary measures that must take place before any contact play resumes and says that until a valid treatment or vaccine is available, or herd immunity is reached, preventive measures such as social distancing and face covering should be used if practices or games are to take place in the fall.
   
 In its guidelines, the NFHS recommends that athletes wear cloth face masks in order to prevent the spread of the virus. It also says that, in the event of an outbreak, teams would need to prepare to self-isolate for two or three weeks during the season.
   
 State associations like the PIAA generally use the NFHS's rules to govern high school sports in Pennsylvania. But officials caution these guidelines are just that -- guidelines.
   
 "I know they put it out as a guideline, but guidelines scare me," PIAA Executive Director Robert Lombardi said. "Sometimes, people interpret them as things you should do. I'm not sure the federation's intent was that, at least listening to them, but some states have asked them for help because they have very small staffs."
   
 High school athletics have been canceled in the state since mid-March. The PIAA has postponed any high school sports activities until at least July 1, though it has opened the door for some activities to resume before that if allowed by state health officials.
   
 "That was a resource document that was provided by the federation, trying to give a broad view of all the things that should be considered or should be at least discussed within each state association. By no means is it a firm document that everybody has to follow," said Amy Scheuneman, associate executive director of the WPIAL.
   
 Pennsylvania's adherence to NFHS guidelines could be complicated by the fact that large portions of the state are in different phases of Gov. Tom Wolf's reopening plan. Philadelphia and most of the eastern part of the state are in the red phase, which has more restrictive mitigation policies. The western and northcentral portions of the state have moved to the less restrictive yellow phase. No counties are in the green phase as of May 21.
   
 "That answer is to be determined based upon what the governor and the department of education want to come forward with," Lombardi said. "Anything prior to us getting some real factual information is nothing more than conjecture."
   
 Even if the state forges its own path and simply uses the document as a reference guide, it offers a glimpse of what may come, with some sports getting underway while others stay on the bench. As part of the guidelines, the NFHS introduced three phases that should be reached before a full return to sports. It also split up all high school sports into three categories based on risk: Lower Risk, Moderate Risk and Higher Risk.
   
 Lower Risk sports include individual activities like golf and cross country. Moderate Risk sports would include team activities with some contact, like baseball, softball, soccer, volleyball, and basketball. Higher Risk sports involve the most contact like football, wrestling, and competitive cheer.
   
 Recommendations from health and government officials would be used to determine movement through each phase.
   
 The first phase would recommend against the shared use of equipment and the cleaning of equipment after each usage. Students should remain 6 feet apart, no more than 10 people should be gathered together, and locker rooms stay closed.
   
 The second phase would include workout groups of up to 50 people outdoors and 10 people indoors, with social distancing in effect. Locker rooms can open, and Lower Risk sports can resume. The third phase allows gatherings of up to 50 people, though athletes should maintain some distance when not competing or in workouts. Moderate Risk sports could resume, while feedback from the previous steps would determine when Higher Risk sports could fully return.
   
 Even with Higher Risk sports in action, the NFHS considers spectators and vendors as "non-essential" and said they should not be permitted at events until restrictions on mass gatherings are lifted.
   
 "First of all, I'm happy that (the NFHS) is setting guidelines just because everybody wants to get back to sports," said Patti Brown, the athletic director at Corry Area High School. "We need clear guidelines and we need to be proactive, so hopefully we'll get started after the next month. I'm happy that the PIAA also is talking about this."
   
 However, Brown did see many challenges ahead. Schools could be hindered by a shortage of funds to implement new policies and and lack of employees to carry them out. Trainers could be especially challenged to keep up with the new, extensive safety protocols before, during and after workouts.
   
 "We'll certainly have to relook at our budget to see if we need to cut something in order to bring in all of the necessary (resources)," she said.

“As far as we know the provider was wearing a mask in the clinic. I think the risk to my staff and to the patients that were served that day were very low,” Silvernail said. “Unfortunately as this continues to circulate in the community we will likely to see more of this where people inadvertently expose others.”
 A six-day wait before testing is recommended because a false negative could come from testing too soon, he said.
 “The virus needs some time to incubate in an individual before you can detect it,” he said.
 The most common time to develop the illness after exposure is one to three days. Many people have presented by five days and most everybody has presented by day six or seven, Silvernail said.
 With in-person clinical services suspended, patients who have upcoming appointments will be contacted to reschedule, or to be served via telehealth. Walk-in clinical services will not be provided until further notice. Further disinfection measures will be taken, in addition to the cleaning procedures currently in place.
 The Women, Infants and Children Program and other non-clinical services will be provided as usual. The Health Department will continue to provide temperature checks of anyone entering the facility. Individuals are encouraged to wear a face covering, cloth mask or scarf as an additional protective measure.
 Individuals who are sick should not visit the health department, Silvernail said.
 “I hate to send anybody to the emergency department, but the emergency department is available if someone needs care urgently,” he said. “We will try to be up and running for those services that were suspended as soon as possible.”
 Pitt County reported the cumulative positive testing total for COVID-19 on Thursday was 267, four cases higher than Wednesday. The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services reported 273 cases in Pitt County on Thursday, six cases higher than its total for Wednesday.
 Thursday marked the fifth incubation cycle or — 10 weeks — since the first COVID-19 case was identified in Pitt County, Silvernail said.
 “Unfortunately it also is the day we dreaded would come for some time, the day one of our own health care workers tested positive for COVID-19,” he said.
 “While we have taken steps to protect our staff and clients from COVID-19 viruses are devilish things and (have) found a gap in our defenses,” he said.

State House Republicans from the area said they had little contact with a GOP member who announced Wednesday that he had tested positive for COVID-19 on May 20, six days after he was last in the Capitol.
   
 State Rep. Josh Kail, R-15, Beaver, sits on the House Judiciary and Liquor Control committees with Dauphin County state Rep. Andrew Lewis, who said he had self-quarantined after testing positive.
   
 On Thursday, Kail said neither committee he shared with Lewis has met in person since March amid the pandemic. "Thankfully, I haven't had any contact with him," Kail said.
   
 Kail refuted Democratic accusations that Lewis' condition was kept secret from them while Republicans were informed, saying that he only learned of Lewis testing positive from reports on Wednesday.
   
 "There were very few people who actually knew," Kail said, who echoed other GOP members insisting that Lewis followed guidelines put out by the CDC and the Wolf administration.
   
 State Rep. Jim Marshall, R-14, Big Beaver, also said he was unaware of Lewis' condition and only found out when he texted state Rep. Rob Matzie, D-16, Ambridge, on Wednesday.
   
 Marshall, who said he has had no interaction with Lewis, said Lewis was obligated to tell all House members about his positive test as well as the public because of his movements outside of the capitol building.
   
 "When you're an elected official, you no longer have privacy," Marshall said. "I think it should've been made public."
   
 State Rep. Aaron Bernstine, R-10, New Beaver, said he is "good friends" with Lewis, but has not been around him during the timeframe in question.
   
 Matzie had scathing words for House Republican leadership.
   
 "The fact that Republican leadership would try to bury this information is unconscionable. There is no excuse," Matzie said. "They knew for at least a week, if not longer. Letting these members wander the Capitol - without masks I'd add - and expose colleagues and staff is, frankly, disgusting."
   
 Matzie said he and other Democrats are demanding "more stringent rules, including disclosure," following Lewis' announcement.
   
 Calling it a "sad day in the history of the House of Representatives," Matzie said "all avenues should be explored to determine who knew what and when did they know it."

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer spending plunged by a record- shattering 13.6% in April as the viral pandemic shuttered businesses, forced millions of layoffs and sent the economy into a deep recession. Last month's spending decline was far worse than the revised 6.9% drop in March, which itself had set a record for the steepest one-month fall in records dating to 1959. Friday's Commerce Department figures reinforced evidence that the economy is gripped by the worst downturn in decades, with consumers unable or too anxious to spend much. Even with employers cutting millions of jobs during the month, personal incomes soared 10.5% in April, reflecting billions of dollars in support through government payments in the form of unemployment benefits and stimulus checks. The depth of the spending drop is particularly damaging because consumer spending is the primary driver of the economy, accounting for about 70% of economic activity. Last month’s figure signaled that the April-June quarter will be especially grim, with the economy thought to be shrinking at an annual rate near 40%. That would be, by far, the worst quarterly contraction on record. Friday's report showed sharp declines in consumer spending across the board — from durable goods like cars to non- durable items such as clothing and services ranging from doctor visits to haircuts. In April, the nation's jobless rate was 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression, and many economists think it will top 20% for May. States are gradually restarting their economies by letting some businesses reopen with certain restrictions, and some laid-off employees are being recalled to work. Still, the job market remains severely depressed, and the outlook for the rest of the year is still bleak. Some financial support for the tens of millions of consumers who have been...

It's a digital world, but Karen Morrow never thought she'd see the day people would buy houses online without ever crossing a threshold.
   
 Chalk it up to the novel coronavirus.
   
 The pandemic forced people to come up with novel ways to circumvent mandates to stem the highly contagious infection spread by people-to-people contact.
   
 "At first I thought 'who's going to buy a house online,'" said Morrow, a Realtor with RE/MAX Select Realty in Center Township.
   
 "I show people houses and they're in there for three hours," she said, inspecting every nook and cranny.
   
 But virtual home sales are moving forward, she said.
   
 "It's working out."
   
 Dynamics obviously changed because of the health crisis.
   
 Social distancing prevented real estate agents from hosting open houses for potential buyers. Instead, showings were virtually with sellers using Zoom and FaceTime to record room-to-room walk-throughs, for example. Closings were conducted electronically.
   
 Some sellers -- "still COVID-scared," Morrow said -- are "apprehensive about people coming into their home" and simply delayed listing them or removed them from the market.
   
 Home inspections and loans also were affected. Inspectors were allowed inside a home; Realtors were not.
   
 And the economic fallout caused jitters, too, causing some consumers to pull back from major purchases. Others no longer qualified for mortgages having lost jobs.
   
 The Federal Housing Administration raised its credit score for first-time home buyers, which took a lot of buyers out of the market because they no longer qualified for loans, said Biba Lubenski of Wayne Township, a Realtor with Howard Hanna Real Estate Services.
   
 February and early spring is usually the peak housing market season, she said.
   
 "We're behind the 8 ball, but buyers are out there ready to buy. It's a good thing."
   
 As markets find their footing in response to COVID-19, Realtor.com predicts continued "ups and downs" in 2020, with sales rebounding in late summer and early fall as coronavirus fears abate.
   
 The real estate site's forecast:
   
 • Home price growth will flatten, with a forecasted increase of 1.1 percent.
   
 • Inventory will remain low, but the rate of decline steadies and the mix of homes for sale shifts toward greater availability of lower-priced homes.
   
 • Mortgage rates remain low and may slide under 3 percent by the end of the year.
   
 • Home sales are constrained by low inventory and diminished seller and buyer confidence as the effects of COVID linger in the labor market.
   
 • Buyers seeking affordability and space drive interest in the suburbs.
   
 Morrow's confident in a rebound.
   
 "I think it's really going to break loose," she said whenever stay-at-home restrictions are lifted in Pennsylvania. "All in all, we have a lot of people with their tongues hanging out ready to roll."
   
 Presently, counties in western Pennsylvania remain in the yellow phase under Gov. Tom Wolf's color-coded reopening plan, which gives agents more leeway, but the recommended and preferred practice is to continue with virtual home tours until given the "green" light.
   
 Morrow and other Realtors are now able to show and list homes. However, those appointments will be very different.
   
 Pennsylvania Association of Realtors created "real estate best practices" developed by a task force to govern transactions during the "age of COVID-19." Essentially, it's a framework for brokers to follow that includes forms outlining hygiene and property access rules for buyers and sellers, and a health-screening acknowledgment form that identifies some of the most common risk factors for contracting the virus.
   
 Only two prospective buyers and the selling agent are permitted inside the home, said Lubenski, and "everyone has to wear a mask" and practice social distancing.
   
 Gloves and disinfecting touch points are musts, too. Appointments must be scheduled with a minimum 30 minutes between showings.
   
 Iris Marko has been in the business more than 32 years and said real estate agents are "dealing with stuff that no one has ever experienced."
   
 She's a Realtor with Howard Hanna West Suburban office in Moon Township and said April's numbers were "very good" despite not being able to do in-person showings or open houses.
   
 "We were able to work remotely. People were making offers and offers were being accepted electronically. Contracts were being written up," she said. "Now, we'll be able to proceed further since we went into yellow. Hopefully, things will transpire quickly since we're allowed to start showing homes."
   
 Like Morrow, Marko thought it "amazing" that people made offers on houses "basically sight unseen."
   
 But most contracts written during the pandemic gave buyers a day to view the property once COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and then decide whether to proceed or terminate the agreement, she said.
   
 "And the seller is willing to take that risk," Morrow said.
   
 As with most things, the law of supply and demand is in play.
   
 Homes listed for sale receive multiple offers because inventory is low.
   
 "It has been the last couple, five years," said Marko. "It's critically low now."
   
 Which is why, she said, when a new listing appears, buyers "jump on it."
   
 Lubenski thinks some sellers are waiting "to see what's going on. They don't want to put their house on the market if they can't show it."
   
 But she encourages the opposite.
   
 "Now, everybody's home. Everybody's on the internet. Your home's getting so much exposure through the social network. People definitely are looking at them."
   
 And with most people spending more time at home, they also are engaged in DIY projects -- cleaning, painting, remodeling.
   
 "My sellers are working on their houses, getting them ready. We are going to have the nicest-looking homes on the market," said Lubenski.
   
 Mortgage rates now are historically low.
   
 The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.28 percent during the week ending May 14, according to MarketWatch.
   
 "It's a great incentive, right now, for people to buy," Lubenski said.
   
 "It sure is a good time," echoed Morrow.
   
 However, Realtor.com said qualifying criteria will be tougher as lenders seek to mitigate their risks against economic uncertainty.
   
 "This means buyers need more cash for a down payment and higher credit scores in order to get a loan," the site said.
   
 Realtors also see a continuation of virtual tours "as a matter of course" even if coronavirus is put behind us.
   
 They're a time-saver for both seller and buyer and afford a layer of protection against infection.
   
 "I think it's a good thing," Lubenski said.
   
 The current real estate situation will take "a little while to rebound," predicts Lubenski, but "I don't expect it to be like the 2008 housing crisis. We don't expect that at all. This is a totally different circumstance.
   
 "This honestly is a hiccup. It definitely was a setback, but from what I'm seeing in Lawrence County with turning yellow, things are moving…I think we're going to be fine."

Loro lo guardano adoranti, lui scherza e ridono insieme, in un clima di complicità e allegria sincera e contagiosa, che è bella da vedere per chi se li trova a passare di fianco, a passo svelto, tra piazza Duomo, via Belenzani e via Manci. Impossibile non voltarsi a guardarli. La conferenza è andata bene, sono contenti. Alberto Alesina è esausto, perché non si risparmia mai in questi confronti pubblici, come in tutto ciò a cui si dedica.      Ma è lui a congratularsi con i due studenti di dottorato all’università di Harvard, che lo hanno seguito a Trento al Festival dell’Economia. «I miei studenti sono i miei figli» confessa il professore e gli si illumina il viso mentre lo dice, come solo un grande amore può riuscire a fare.      Alesina era stato invitato a Trento l’anno scorso da Tito Boeri a presentare una indagine illuminante sulla falsa percezione dell’immigrazione in Europa, oltre al libro - allora appena uscito - «Austerità. Quando funziona e quando no» (edizioni Rizzoli), scritto insieme a Carlo Favero e al caro amico Francesco Giavazzi, libro che da poco ha ottenuto il premio Hayek, intitolato all’economista premio Nobel nel ’74.      Non poteva sapere, nessuno poteva immaginare, che sarebbe stato il suo ultimo Festival. E la sua improvvisa scomparsa è stato uno shock per chi lo stimava e gli voleva bene.   Gli piaceva questa kermesse trentina, che metteva a portata di mano di persone di ogni tipo tante occasioni di dibattito sui temi economici, ma con protagonisti di altissimo livello. E gli piaceva proprio per questo. Detestava infatti l’improvvisazione - salvo quella pianistica di Keith Jarrett - e la mediocrità, specie se unita a saccenza e presunzione, caratteristiche lontanissime dal suo modo di essere.   Non mancava di ripetere quanto era stato bravo Tito ad avere l’idea. Ma al tempo stesso, alla fine, furono poche le volte in cui venne al Festival, perché per venirci doveva avere qualcosa da dire. Non era infatti un presenzialista. «Non è il mio campo» diceva, quando il titolo scelto per quell’anno non era nelle sue corde. Meglio andare a scalare in montagna, sul suo amato Monte Bianco. E comunque aveva sempre mille altri impegni.      La prima volta che venne al Festival fu nel 2009, in piena crisi economica, e sostenne che «le grandi opere non servono per uscire dalla crisi, sono spesso inutili e troppo lente», quando allora tutti dicevano il contrario.      Si è trovato spesso controcorrente e senza paura di sentirsi in minoranza o persino isolato nelle sue posizioni, come sul tema dell’”austerità”, che lo rese oggetto di un durissimo attacco da parte del premio Nobel Paul Krugman; ma ha sempre portato avanti le sue idee poggiandole sui numeri e su argomenti solidi, mai sulle chiacchiere. E soprattutto senza pregiudizi o partito preso.      Non incasellava gli altri e avrebbe voluto non essere incasellato, perché aveva una libertà di pensiero tale da permettersi di mettersi sempre in discussione, ammettere gli errori e cambiare opinione. Per questo amava confrontarsi con le persone che incontrava, poteva essere chiunque, l’importante è che da questo dialogo potesse ricevere qualcosa, cogliere uno spunto intelligente, avere un’idea a cui non aveva pensato, aprirgli orizzonti diversi e per questo interessanti. Cercava l’intelligenza e l’autenticità, scappava dalla stupidità, dall’ottusità e la vanagloria delle persone, che fossero professori, notabili, politici o gente comune di ogni sorta, la discriminante era una sola.   Ho conosciuto Alberto Alesina nel 2009, perché mi mandò un messaggio email, per ringraziarmi del pezzo che allora avevo scritto sull’Adige sulla sua conferenza. Mi disse che avevo colto e trasmesso in modo efficace il suo pensiero e mi chiese se avevo voglia di aiutarlo e dirgli cosa ne pensavo del libro che stava scrivendo allora, insieme ad Andrea Ichino. Era «L’Italia fatta in casa» (Edizioni Mondadori), una indagine sulla struttura economica e sociale italiana basata - nel bene e nel male - sulla famiglia.      Iniziò a mandarmi le bozze dei capitoli e io a dire la mia, soprattutto quello che non mi convinceva. E lui era contento specialmente di questo. La sua preoccupazione era rendere semplici e interessanti per tutti i concetti difficili. Ci riusciva sempre. Fu un’esperienza bellissima.   Il libro è stupendo e io sono ancora incredula della fiducia del professore di Harvard, che si faceva dare del tu, come dai suoi studenti, e incoraggiava a tirare fuori il meglio di sé, rivelando una umanità straordinaria.      In questi 11 anni abbiamo continuato a scriverci, fino a poche settimane fa, in piena pandemia da Coronavirus in Italia e negli Usa. Scherzava, dicendomi che avrei dovuto mettere la mascherina anche al mio cavallo. I viaggi erano saltati. Lui era molto preoccupato per le conseguenze economiche di questa crisi, ma anche per il futuro dell’Europa e per quel virus del populismo che attacca le democrazie liberali, come ha scritto magistralmente in un recente imperdibile editoriale sul Corriere della Sera a doppia firma con Francesco Giavazzi.      Alesina era curioso di quanto stava accadendo nella politica italiana, faceva parte del suo lavoro, perché economia e politica non possono essere due mondi separati per incidere sulla realtà. Gli piaceva sollecitare interpretazioni diverse e sintetiche dei fatti politici, anche degli episodi minori o buffi, su cui non risparmiava battute, mentre spesso quando si trovava negli Stati Uniti, non aveva il tempo e non voleva trovarlo, di informarsi di queste dinamiche e se le faceva raccontare. Le beghe politiche italiane, infatti, le considerava assurde, quasi come Donald Trump. E così i suoi commenti - alla fine - erano sempre sagacemente e inesorabilmente netti e spietati.

Martin Kanschat had a lot to be thankful for earlier this month.
   
 The 72-year-old resident at Rochester Manor and Villa had beat COVID-19 -- not a small feat for a senior citizen. But he couldn't hug and kiss his family in celebration.
   
 That's not how it works in COVID world.
   
 Instead, administrators and staff at the Rochester facility celebrated him the best they could -- they threw a parade complete with balloons and signs, classic cars and a big ole fire engine.
   
 "We've been doing Skype visits, but it's different when you can set eyes on your loved one in person, even if there's glass between you," said Kristin Goldstrom Oeder, executive director of the facility. "It has to be kinda tough at home. You're wondering how your husband or parents or grandparents are doing inside this place you can't visit."
   
 Parades, socially distant kissing booths and drive-by visits are the new norm for those with loved ones living at nursing homes. It looks like that won't be going anywhere anytime soon.
   
 Beaver County entered the state's "yellow" phase of reopening on May 22, but there are still strict restrictions on visitation at long-term care facilities.
   
 That's left nursing homes to get creative with how they can reunite loved ones.
   
 Since facilities were shut down to visitors in March, staff and residents have used Skype and other video chat programs to help connect residents.
   
 A video only goes so far.
   
 At Concordia at Villa St. Joseph, staff would create musical numbers where residents would hold up signs to participate and sing along that would be shared with residents.
   
 Seeing her mom hold up a sign reminding her that "you are my sunshine" during a "performance" of "When You're Smiling" made Linda Moreland cry happy tears. She misses her mother, Doris Swartzlander, but the staff's creativity at Villa St. Joseph has helped soothe some of that.
   
 "They always do more than what you would expect -- they put themselves out there just to keep us all in the loop," Moreland said in April. "They know how close we are. They know this is hard, I can't say enough about what the staff is doing."
   
 At Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Brighton Township, staff is trying to set up safe visitations with families in pavilions or with other precautions to keep families and residents safe. The former county-owned Friendship Ridge nursing home is the site of the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the state and one of the worst in the nation.
   
 But families are still able to share some love and affection -- from afar -- through drive-by visits and socially distant conversations.
   
 At Beaver Valley Health Care & Rehabilitation in South Beaver Township, family members did their own parade, driving by a line of residents and staff who couldn't come close. Residents bundled up in early May to hunker down and say hello, wearing masks, blankets and heavy clothes in the unseasonable weather.
   
 And then there's Rochester Manor, where staff has created a socially distant haven for family to visit. In their courtyard, families are reunited with their loved ones behind glass. They can play tic tac toe and take part in a kissing booth through plexiglass.
   
 "We understand the need to visit -- we're trying to do it in the safest way possible," Goldstrom Oeder said.

HAGERSTOWN, Md. -- A fugitive college student on the run for six days and wanted in the slayings of two people in Connecticut was taken into custody in the Halfway area, according to Maryland State Police and Hagerstown Police Chief Paul Kifer.
   
 Kifer said he got a text at 9:26 p.m. Wednesday after his investigators learned Peter Manfredonia, 23, was in custody. Police were told Manfredonia walked out of a wooded area behind the Pilot truck stop at Halfway Boulevard and Hopewell Road and turned himself in, Kifer said.
   
 The U.S. Marshals Service and Washington County Sheriff's Office were at the scene along with state police, authorities said.
   
 Further information about Manfredonia's custody was not immediately available.
   
 Kifer said earlier there was "high confidence" the man an Uber driver dropped off in downtown Hagerstown on Tuesday morning was Manfredonia.
   
 Hagerstown police had been treating the situation as if Manfredonia, 23, was still in the area even though he had a pattern of not staying in one place too long, Kifer said.
   
 Hagerstown police were notified early Wednesday afternoon that Manfredonia might have come to the Hub City, Kifer said. That was more than a day after Manfredonia was dropped off downtown, he said.
   
 Information from Pennsylvania State Police, Chambersburg Police Department and U.S. Marshals Service revealed Manfredonia abandoned a stolen vehicle in Chambersburg, Pa., on Tuesday, according to Hagerstown police. Authorities discovered the stolen vehicle on Wednesday. The other agencies investigating determined Manfredonia then took an Uber to Hagerstown.
   
 When notified, Hagerstown police investigators and patrol immediately began going through surveillance footage from the city's cameras and spoke to the Uber driver, who was not familiar with the Hagerstown area, Kifer said. Police believed the Uber driver dropped Manfredonia off mid- to late Tuesday morning in the downtown area and were reviewing camera footage to determine where Manfredonia headed.
   
 Hagerstown Police Lt. Rebecca Fetchu said earlier the male Uber driver was OK.
   
 Pennsylvania State Police on Wednesday afternoon said they had received a tip about a possible sighting of Manfredonia at a Sheetz in Chambersburg. Witness descriptions and surveillance video images matched that of Manfredonia, according to police.
   
 There are three Sheetz gas stations in the Chambersburg area. Two are right off Interstate 81. It was not immediately clear from which Sheetz the images were taken.
   
 The person in the surveillance images hailed an Uber driver, who took the individual to Hagerstown, according to police. A black bag was in his possession, and he was wearing red sneakers.
   
 Pennsylvania State Police also stated that a stolen Hyundai Santa Fe was recovered in the area of the Sheetz. On Tuesday, a Pennsylvania State Police spokesman stationed in northeastern Pennsylvania tweeted that a 2012 black Hyundai Santa Fe was stolen Monday night in an area near where Manfredonia had last been seen on surveillance video.
   
 On Tuesday, a search for Manfredonia lasted several hours, but came up empty after someone spotted a man matching the fugitive's description in northeastern Pennsylvania, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.
   
 Police in Duryea, Pa., said a firefighter spotted a man with a large backpack behind the Germania Hose Co. shortly after 11 p.m. Tuesday. The man fled toward nearby railroad tracks and a wooded area, officials said. The firefighter asked the man what he was doing, but he did not respond as he left the scene, police said.
   
 Authorities said the man fit the description of Manfredonia. The University of Connecticut senior reportedly was seen on Sunday about 50 miles southeast of Duryea in East Stroudsburg walking along railroad tracks with a large bag.
   
 Duryea officials said they called in officers from surrounding towns and state police Tuesday night and used a helicopter to help with the search of the railroad tracks and woods, but they didn't find anyone and called off the search after several hours.
   
 Connecticut State Police said Manfredonia is wanted in the machete killing of 62-year-old Ted DeMers and wounding of another man in Willington on Friday. Manfredonia went to another man's home, held him hostage and stole his guns and truck, then drove about 70 miles southwest to Derby, Connecticut, state police said.
   
 In Derby, police found Manfredonia's high school friend, Nicholas Eisele, 23, shot to death in his home. Authorities believe Manfredonia then forced Eisele's girlfriend into her car and fled the state. The girlfriend was found unharmed with her car at a rest stop on Interstate 80 in Columbia, New Jersey, police said.
   
 Manfredonia then took an Uber to a Walmart in East Stroudsburg, not far from the New Jersey border, Pennsylvania State Police said.
   
 A lawyer for Manfredonia's family said he has struggled with mental health problems, but did not show signs of violence.
   
 The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Per dare la parola a Majorino, Formigli è costretto a togliergli l'audio.

This letter is in response to the letter titled, "You can't bless America and blast the president." The writer mentions the pledge of allegiance to the American flag. The pledge has the words indivisible and liberty and justice for all. Webster defines the word indivisible as not separate, we as Americans are all one.
   
 Tell that to all the unarmed black men, women and children who have been shot to death in our America. The people with the gun doing the killings claim they are the victims and cleared of any wrongdoing. Is this the American definition of liberty and justice for all?
   
 As for ridiculing President Donald J. Trump, his motto is "pass the buck, don't be responsible for any important issue." He passed the coronavirus pandemic to Vice President Mike Pence. Then he passed his presidential leadership to all the state Democratic and Republican governors, totally dividing this nation.
   
 This guy is a divider, not a unifier, AKA Teflon Don. Shame on you Trumpers. You know who you are. Remember in November, dump Trump and make America, America again.

Public transit remains heavily impacted after coming almost to a full freeze or a very significant drop in capacity for weeks. Ridership often came down 80-90% where some traffic remained, as is the case in the USA. As capacity slowly comes back up, commuters will remain reluctant to pack in again on metros, buses, and tramways as shown by this survey performed in London by engineering firm Systra. The short term modal shift to personal vehicles is not sustainable because of its impact on congestion and personal budgets. However, the modal shift towards micromobility and walking will likely linger. Lastly, public transit may suffer from future budget restrictions as local administrations will see reduced tax revenue in the short/mid-term.

Over a period of time, our CBD balms started to line up with what we had envisioned months before. Our continued tinkering, coupled with friends and family feedback, garnered better and better products. We were actually seeing and hearing results! We used my salon to educate and provide free samples to customers with various aches and pains. Word of mouth spread about our “magic cannabis balms” and everyone was requesting samples. From tragedy to opportunity, Muscle MX began to take shape.

Nice review. DH 14 sure does brawl with the best. My H80i came with such loud fans that I had to replace them with 2x Scythe GT 1850RPM which are much quieter and also made a nice drop in my load temps. However, I will be selling my H80i with it's stock fans since I am moving to complete custome water cooling build in a week or so. For those who want bang for buck, Noctua NH-D14 is the way to go.

He said he wears a plain cloth one himself. “People have stopped sending me socks and they’re sending me masks. I now have a few nice ones.

But in Nigeria, no-one is really above board when it comes to petty issues of ethnicity and religion. It's a country where verifiable falsehood is accepted as gospel by even the very educated, if such falsehood is sold to undermine a different ethnic group.
