To pave the way for harmonious relationships, he said it’s important for parents to acknowledge the distress their children are undoubtedly feeling from the hardship of being ripped away from the lives they were living to a new life. Being attuned to that process and expressing sympathy and empathy can go a long way toward heading off disputes, he said.
 Carl Pickhardt, a psychologist and author of the Psychology Today blog, “Surviving Your Child’s Adolescence,” said that for young adults, returning home can feel regressive as they move from living independently to living dependently. “The closer the quarters, the more little differences can be abrasive.” He recommended setting ground rules for living together and bridging lifestyle differences. This includes devising a contract for managing household responsibilities, like how a family will share the same bathroom, washer and dryer and refrigerator.
 Instead of complaining that the grown child is being “messy” and “irresponsible,” which can be inflammatory, he said parents are better served by discussing how and when the kitchen is used and making clear that dirty dishes must be washed and put away after meals.
