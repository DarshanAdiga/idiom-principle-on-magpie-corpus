Early on in this history of the _Fast and Furious_ franchise, the movies were known primarily for cool cars and car stunts, as well as showing the ins and outs of the street racing scene, which included fun-loving chicks in skimpy outfits.

It’s smart to wash the wheels first with a wheel cleaner to avoid water drying on the paint. In my experience, products from AMMO, Wizard’s, Meguiar’s and Griot’s Garage do the best job without possibly ruining wheel finishes. Using a wheel brush––I like a foam brush with a removable microfiber sleeve so I can wash the sleeve for reuse––clean both the front face of the wheel and inside the wheel’s barrel. Make sure to clean the dirt, brake dust, and debris from the wheel brush after each wheel (or mid wheel depending on the level of dirt) in the dirty water bucket, then use the soapy water bucket to wet the wheel brush. Rinse each wheel after finishing.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

London, May 1 (AFP) Scottish football's medical chief has warned that the coronavirus pandemic could exacerbate mental health problems among "at-risk" players.
 Global players' union FIFPro last month warned of a sharp rise in the number of footballers reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression since the game was suspended worldwide.
 A study in 2015 found that 64 percent of players in Scotland reported that they or a team-mate had experienced issues with their mental health.
 "Our initial study identified key triggers for mental health issues in football," John MacLean, the Scottish Football Association's chief medical consultant, told the SFA's website.
 "These include players at the beginning or end of their career with uncertainty around their new contracts and the prospect of having to find employment and finance outside professional football."
 "At times like this, some players already considered to be at risk will potentially feel further impact," he added.
 MacLean sits on the COVID-19 joint response group, which brings together the SFA and the Scottish Professional Football League.
 Football in Scotland has been suspended until at least June 10 and all leagues below the Premiership have been declared over for the season.
 England's Premier League clubs were meeting on Friday to discuss proposals on how to finish the campaign behind closed doors.
 "From a medical perspective, we will look at the issues in the journey back to training and eventual matches," said MacLean.
 "We will discuss the practicalities of testing, protocols for unwell players and staff, as well as using facilities shared with other groups.
 "When you list all the different aspects, it's quite a task but we have a group motivated to find solutions and take advice from others around the UK and the world, in both football and other sports." (AFP)

Even in these trying times where companies are slashing dividends in order to conserve cash, PepsiCo is giving back to the shareholders, to the tune of $7.5 billion with share repurchases and cash dividend payouts, from its cash- generative business.

So, the question is what to take away from these new statements. To me, it seems like Universal is trying to walk the line between not publicly apologizing for this dust-up but also trying to signal to theater chains that it will respect the theatrical window on bigger titles. At the end of the day, both AMC and Regal have made it clear it will not program Universal movies that don’t respect the window. They don’t have any financial incentive to do that, and it’s hard to see them budging on anything except maybe the length.

Great, thanks for the questions. I guess just following up on the Health Services segment, the retention rate you guys laid out, obviously, looks pretty solid as you think about 2021. I'm just curious, how this selling season, it's early, has progressed, just given I can only imagine payers are doing benefit managers that payers are dealing with a lot of other distractions right now. So wondering if that's adding to maybe a reluctance to explore switching? And then conversely, do you think because of those dynamics that there might be less opportunity this year for net new wins just given that the retention rates across the board might in fact be higher?

Based on application, the oilfield chemicals market has been classified into production chemicals, drilling fluids, well stimulation fluids, cementing fluids, enhanced oil recovery, and workover and completion. According to the American Petroleum Institute (API), a drilling fluid is defined as a circulating fluid used in rotary drilling to perform any or all of the functions in drilling operations. It is a mixture of natural and synthetic chemical compounds that are employed to lubricate and cool the drill bit; carry cuttings to the surface; clean the hole bottom; control formation pressures; and improve the function of the drill string and tools in the hole. The drilling fluids segment has been classified into two sub-segments: water- based drilling muds and oil-based drilling muds. Type of the fluid base to be used depends on drilling and formation requirements and requirements for disposal of the fluid. Some of the drilling fluids are anti-foams, corrosion control inhibitors, dispersants, scale inhibitors, shale stabilizers, thinners and conditioners, viscosifiers, and surfactants. The drilling fluids application segment constituted a prominent i.e. more than 40% share of the global oilfield chemicals market in 2017. The share is estimated to increase by the end of the forecast period.

There’s always a healthy bit of tension and sometimes even barely concealed animosity in the movie business.

This battle did not occur behind closed doors, but it’s hard to imagine anyone involved letting that get in the way of what has been and should continue to be a productive partnership down the road.

An heir to the Hot Pockets fortune and a former investment executive who participated in the college admissions cheating scheme won't get to serve their punishments at home, but they can delay going to prison until this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic, a judge has ruled. Michelle Janavs, whose family invented Hot Pockets, and Douglas Hodge, the ex-CEO of Pacific Investment Management Co., can remain free until at least June 30, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton ruled Thursday. Gorton denied their requests for home confinement instead of prison time, saying he will “not forfeit his obligation to impose a sentence that is warranted by a defendant's criminal conduct\" despite the “evolving cause of concern” posed by the COVID-19 outbreak. “If the public health crisis has not abated by the time of the extended report date, the court will entertain further motions,” the judge wrote. Lawyers for Janavs and Hodge had argued it's too dangerous to send them to prison. The virus has been rampant in prisons and jails across the country, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr has instructed officials to consider moving nonviolent and vulnerable inmates to home confinement to help limit the spread of the virus behind bars. Their lawyers didn't immediately respond to email seeking comment Friday.

This is a different scenario where you could see a V, or in our case, we've modeled the U, and that might be a scenario where stronger growth comes later versus in the short term. And so I think we have to strike that right balance to ensure that we don't go overboard in working capital. But overall, I would expect conversion to be strong given the historical dynamics we've seen.

Universal, as well, has every financial incentive to work with the movie theaters. _Trolls 2_ may have found some success using PVOD, but how many movies can that realistically work for? In addition, some of the company’s biggest titles, _Fast And Furious_ as an example, are clearly shot and made for the big screen. They don’t translate as well to being viewed at home, and it’s hard to imagine they would put up nearly the total grosses if the theater was removed from the equation.

If there is no chance finish the season and play the play-offs, there is a suggestion that the teams in third on average points in the Championship and League One would get the nod to go up – and likewise the team in fourth in League Two, and second in the National Leagues.
 That would all mean that Derby County would lose Leeds United, West Bromwich Albion and Fulham from the Championship fixture list – and gain Coventry City, Rotherham United and Wycombe Wanderers, who leap from eighth to third on average points.
 Would League One – following last summer’s demise of Bury – stay as 23 teams by losing three teams to the Championship and only gaining three from League Two?

Microsoft usually doesn't issue the outlook in its earnings press release, but the company provides the outlook during the earnings call. Microsoft expects the continued demand across Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming in Q4. However, growth might be impacted when the stay-at-home guidelines eased. Advertising spend levels are not expected to improve in Q4, which will impact Search and LinkedIn businesses. In Commercial business, the sales dynamics from March are expected to continue, including a significant impact in LinkedIn from the weak job market and increased volatility in new, longer lead time deal closures.   Capital expenditures are expected to increase sequentially in Q4 to support the growing usage and demand for cloud services.

Now moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook. Our capital-efficient businesses generate a substantial amount of cash flow, which provides us with financial flexibility, particularly in times of stress. In the first quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flows from operations. We also deployed $1.1 billion to debt repayment in the first quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 5.9 million shares of stock for $1.1 billion. For 2020, we continue to expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well- performing businesses. Looking to our liquidity and flexibility, as of March 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of cash available to the parent. In April, we entered into a term loan for $1.4 billion to further enhance our current liquidity position in light of disruptions in the commercial paper market. We feel very good about the cash flows that our businesses generate and our overall liquidity. And I would also note that we have access to an additional $4.25 billion in committed and untapped revolving lines of credit.

Don't get me wrong, I love the guys, Sammy, Kruger, Aaron, Kristin, Lincoln, Brandon, Derek, Béla, Tony, Alison, I love them all … we're brothers. Crowe and I are brothers. But, I don't listen to their banjo playing. Like to take it apart. Understand, to me, the right hand is the most important part for a person to conquer. A great right hand, with all the correct moves, and the rest will fall into place. All of the above have great right hands that fits perfectly with what they want to accomplish with the banjo. But for me to play what I play, the way I go about it, 'twould be a detriment to my way of thinking!

The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has been devastating, and California must continue to act decisively to help mitigate the damage. As a California state senator representing the 8th Senate District, I have learned heartbreaking stories from employees and business owners who are seeing their dreams and investments dismantled. If lucky enough to have employment, many working parents are forced to juggle work with the new demands of homeschooling, often while vulnerable elderly fend for themselves in solitude. As a father of two school-aged children with elderly parents, this hits close to home. (State Sen. Andreas Borgeas, 4/28)
