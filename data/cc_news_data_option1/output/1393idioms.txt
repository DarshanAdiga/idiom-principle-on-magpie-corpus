WASHINGTON (AP) — In a first, small step toward reopening the country, the Trump administration issued new guidelines to make it easier for essential workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 to get back to work if they do not have symptoms of the coronavirus. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced Wednesday at the White House that essential employees, such as health care and food supply workers, who have been within 6 feet of a confirmed or suspected case of the virus can return to work under certain circumstances if they are not experiencing symptoms. The new guidelines are being issued as the nation mourns more than 14,000 deaths from the virus and grapples with a devastated economy and medical crises from coast to coast. Health experts continue to caution Americans to practice social distancing and to avoid returning to their normal activities. At the same time, though, they are planning for a time when the most serious threat from COVID-19 will be in the country’s rear- view mirror. President Donald Trump said that while he knows workers are “going stir crazy” at home, he can't predict when the threat from the virus will wane. “The numbers are changing and they’re changing rapidly and soon we’ll be over that curve. We’ll be over the top and we’ll be headed in the right direction. I feel strongly about that,\" Trump said about the coronavirus, which he called \"this evil beast.” “I can’t tell you in terms of the date,\" Trump said, adding cases could go down and then once again “start going up if we’re not careful. ” At some point, he said at his daily briefing, social distancing guidelines will disappear and people will be able to sit together at sports events. “At some point we expect to be back, like it was before,” he...

The neighbors were the first ones to take notice of the Sentinel Boys, and they didn’t welcome them with open arms. “They got tired of the nonstop free- form jams coming from downstairs,” Worley says. “We’d get notes from all the neighbors saying, ‘These are apartments, not recording studios!’”
 Free form is as good a term as any to describe the Sentinel Boys’ sound. It was a lively mix of styles and genres from folk to jazz to bluegrass to rock blended with whatever else crossed their path and struck their fancy.
 “The only rule we had was we had to like it,” Worley says of the Boys’ eclectic tastes reflected in their music. “Bluegrass, jazz, whatever — McCoy Tyner one second, bluegrass the next. Made perfect sense,” he deadpans. “We just felt like if we liked it, probably everybody else would. If we got into it, hopefully it would rub off.”
 Kelly says the band members were big fans of world music before there was such a label. “Remember the label Nonesuch Records? That was a big influence on us. We loved hearing that strange and beautiful music. It just so happened to combine with a time when jazz had done sharp left turn, Miles (Davis) had gotten electrified, and the whole world was rotating in a different direction.”
 Locals accepted it, supporting their shows enough to allow the Boys a nearly two-year run doing Friday nights at Aliza’s Cafe beneath the Hong Kong House on Tate Street. The band took it out of town as well, playing gigs at Cat’s Cradle in Chapel Hill and an outing to the coast and up to Boone, even venturing as far as Richmond and Washington, D.C.
 But the Boys’ eclectic offerings didn’t endear them to all club owners. “Some of them admired our courage or lack of good sense, I don’t know which,” Kelly says. “We’d literally do a Flatt and Scruggs song and then do a John Coltrane or McCoy Tyner the next. People didn’t know what to think, man. Occasionally people would go, ‘Yeah, this is great. Don’t call us, we’ll call you about that return date,’ but no death threats or anything.”
 By all accounts even the local gigs were loosely organized, to say the least. “Honestly, I couldn’t tell you how we all knew we had a gig to go to,” Worley says. “We just sorta showed up. Got through somehow.”
 Pricing was a key factor. The band charged a very reasonable 50 cent admission fee at first, but when they tried to raise it to a dollar, all hell broke loose. “I’ve got the poster,” Manring says, “got the original poster where it was 50 cents, and it was crossed out and said $1, and that’s when people mutinied and that’s all written on the poster. There’s blood on it and everything. It’s a killer poster.” Manring has since passed on his trophy, now framed up, gifting it to Kelly after the project the two worked on to restore and remaster some of the original Sentinel Boys tapes onto an anthology offered to the public as the first and only commercially available product of the nearly 50-year-old band.
 The year 1973 is the agreed upon date for the band’s startup, and it kind of stuttered to a halt around 1978. But in between, they created some exceptional music. The three were all extremely gifted musicians, who despite their youth, had a good deal of experience playing and recording in many and varying styles.
 Scott Manring and Worley were the vocalists, with Manring also handling guitars, mandolin, Dobro and harp and was the principal songwriter. Dennis Worley also wrote, played guitar and could sing like a fallen angel. With Bobby Kelly on bass and Mu-tron, it provided a groove deep enough for a Rhino to lie down and wallow in.
 The songs were novels compressed into small packages, spooling out intriguing tales bristling with snarky, sophisticated witticisms.
 “They were just such great players, and they’d all had such great experience, and they’d already recorded some,” Manring says of compatriots Kelly and Worley. “(Worley) was just an amazing singer, and his tunes were spot-on. They just were all so good,” Manring. “I guess the tunes just fit what we knew how to do, or we fit what we knew how to do to those words. But I think for a songwriter, he’s hard to beat. He’s got a lot of class, and for the stuff to be so sophisticated and so cool, it was different, you know. It was just a cut above to me.”

McGinty added that most hospitals and long-term care facilities are not equipped to store large numbers of deceased victims, so the temporary morgue is designed to ease that burden.      “You know in any incident it’s about being prepared and we are prepared at this point,” said McGinty.      Of course, no one yet knows when COVID-19 deaths will peak in Indiana or how many people will die and the hope is the 750 cold storage slabs won’t be needed, but they’ll be ready if they are.      “You know we actually pray we don’t see anything near what is projected,” said McGinty. “We just simply wanted to be prepared and didn’t want to be in a situation where we had nowhere to store bodies.”      In the meantime, McGinty joins other health officials in encouraging people to continue to social distance with the hope that the spread of the virus will be slowed and the number of deaths will come down.      “We certainly want to see the numbers decrease and don’t want to have that facility filled at all,” said McGinty.      The temporary morgue will be staffed round the clock 24 hours a day. Funeral homes will be able to pick up bodies between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m.

BOSTON (AP) — When Rebeka McBride and her husband put their home in Washington state on the market in early March, the coronavirus outbreak was just taking hold in the United States. They managed to hold two open houses and a smattering of private viewings before accepting an offer. But with the U.S. economy now collapsing, the family is less confident about their move to a Minneapolis suburb, where McBride sees brighter job prospects in her field of medical device research. She worries that their buyer will pull out before closing. And for her own new home, she's using virtual tours but isn't inclined to make an offer without seeing a home in person. Worse, McBride is suddenly worried about job prospects amid mass layoffs, forcing a reassessment of what she and her husband can afford. “I’m nervous the layoffs and change in economy will cause the bottom to fall out,” said McBride, the mother of a 4-year-old. McBride is among many sellers and buyers, in the United States as well as in Europe, caught in the grip of a pandemic that has upended the housing market just as it was entering the busy spring season. Shutdown orders have halted open houses and complicated property viewings. Sellers are delaying listings or yanking their properties off the market. Prospective buyers are dropping out, some of them after losing jobs. Agents are turning to virtual tours, electronic signatures and “drive-through” closings, where paperwork is completed through car windows. Where it’s still allowed, buyers and agents are entering homes separately, armed with hand sanitizers and wipes. Mortgage applications to buy a home fell 12% in the week that ended April 3 compared with the previous week — and were a stunning 33% lower than in the same week last year, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported.

As for other things drivers and customers should do to mitigate the risk of spreading the virus? It's a refrain we're hearing just about everywhere: "Just wash your hands a lot and don't touch your face," Adalja said.
 The DoorDash driver said he's seen his deliveries increase by 25 to 30% in recent weeks, though he can't say for sure if it's all related to the coronavirus. It's also tax-refund season, he added. The major food-delivery companies — including DoorDash, Caviar, Postmates and Uber Eats — declined to share data on deliveries.
 The four companies are rapidly developing plans and protocols for drivers, who are considered independent contractors (although California lawmakers passed a bill last year to force the companies to treat them as employees). The companies are informing drivers to follow practices encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities. Besides regularly washing hands for 20 seconds, that includes staying home if they're feeling sick and keeping surfaces clean, including those in vehicles and hot- food bags.
 The companies are also implementing new policies or stressing current ones. Some are even creating ambitious financial plans to support drivers who may be sidelined. DoorDash/Caviar and Uber Eats have implemented financial-assistance programs they say will compensate drivers who have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, placed in quarantine and/or asked to self-isolate. Some details of these programs were still being worked out, but a spokesperson for Uber Eats said drivers will be compensated for up to two weeks based on their previous two weeks of earnings, once they provide documentation on their medical condition.
 On Tuesday, Postmates said it has created a fund that will provide credits for drivers in more than 2o states and the District of Columbia to cover their doctor appointments and other medical expenses related to the coronavirus. Postmates drivers who have made at least one delivery in the past two weeks in the 20-plus jurisdictions will be eligible for the credit from a new relief fund. Postmates also announced a pilot program in San Francisco to waive commission fees for restaurants and other business that sign on with the platform. The pilot is an effort to help brick-and-mortar establishments that are experiencing a decline in business because of the virus.
 "Nationally, one in four private sector employees lack access to any sick leave at all," Vikrum Aiyer, Postmates' vice president of public policy, said in a statement. "While our ongoing campaigns in California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois seek to modernize 20th century laws to fit 21st century work for independent workers, now is the time to put aside the politics of the gig economy and work with all stakeholders to develop creative and meaningful emergency support for front line workers who may be exposed. It's the right thing to do."

“Any room we can make for women — the ripple effect — has been really positive,” Shires says of The Highwomen. “We’re making steps in the right direction.”
 Because of their solo careers, The Highwomen have performed live together only a few times, though a tour is in the works. Shires envisions the quartet staging intimate multi-night residencies in different cities, rather than a massive arena tour.
 “That way, we would get to bring our families, which is important to me because I don’t ever get to do that,” says Shires, who has a 4-year-old daughter, Mercy, with her husband and frequent collaborator Jason Isbell. “A smaller room also makes us all feel more together and more connected.”
 Meanwhile, Shires is working some of The Highwomen’s songs into her current Atmosphereless tour. The group’s namesake track, a reimagining of Jimmy Webb’s “Highwayman,” has particular reverence for Shires.
 “It goes past the part of women and into the lines of racial inequalities,” Shires says. “You can take the meaning however you want (of the lyric) ‘we carry the sons you can only hold.’ That song, it’s our mission statement.”

Demand crunch and high inventory are keeping Indian rubber prices depressed despite a slight recovery in the global market. The spot market has been closed for nearly two weeks. At the Indian Commodity Exchange(Icex), April contract for delivery was marginally lower at Rs 117/ kg with just 20 lots of outstanding open interest. “There should be around 2.5 lakh tonnes of rubber with various stakeholders in the country and the demand has dried up,” said Tomy Kurishumoottil, president, Indian Rubber Dealers Federation. He said except for MRF — which bought a good quantity in the last couple of months — demand has been muted from the tyre sector. The federation has written to Rubber Board to request the Centre to ban import of tyre, rubber and other related products till the present crisis is over. “This is the only way that the growers, traders and workers in the rubber industry can survive. The expected 13 lakh tonnes of consumption this year is not going to happen,” Kurishumoottil added. Meanwhile, the current spell of summer rains in different parts of Kerala — the largest rubber producer in the country — is expected to augur well for production. “It could help in resuming tapping after the lockdown. But most tyre companies are flush with stock and procurement by them from the domestic market could be delayed,” said George Valy, a rubber-dealer based in Kottayam. Low price sentiment in India has outweighed firm trend on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (Tocom) and gains in crude oil. Benchmark September Tocom rubber ended at over a week high at151.30 yen a kg, up 2.5 yen from Tuesday. 75059585 “If Opec+ agrees on 14-15 mbpd output cut, it could push oil higher, supporting rubber prices to top Rs 120 per kg on Icex,” said Kunal Shah, head of commodities research, Nirmal Bang. However, he added, if the cut is 10-12 mbpd, it could dampen market sentiment. Rubber prices were expected to slip below Rs 100 per kg in India earlier this month after global body ANRPC forecast sluggish demand in the coming quarters as more and more economies go into extended lockdown to curtail the Covid-19 outbreak. “We continue to maintain a cautious view on prices as global demand is unlikely to recover quickly and despite demand from China, we see prices opening near Rs 115/kg when physical markets open, but dipping to about Rs 105-100/kg before lower prices bring in buyers in the physical market,” said Akshay Agarwal, MD, Acumen Capital.

In the midst of a global pandemic, Kirkland Lake Gold has made some significant changes to its operations in Northeastern Ontario.
 On April 2, the company announced the temporary suspension of all operations at its Holt Complex in Black River-Matheson, as well as a further reduction in operations at the Macassa Mine in Kirkland Lake.
 The new measures are in effect until April 30 and follow the transition of the Detour Lake Mine to reduced operations, which became effective on March 23.
 The company's Fosterville Mine, in Australia, remains in operation with company-wide health and safety protocols implemented.
 The company said the safety of its employees is the No. 1 priority, and workers impacted by the reductions will receive their base wages for the month of April.
 "The latest business reductions are in response to recent developments related to the COVID-19 virus, including increased border restrictions between Ontario and Quebec, which is making the movement of workers increasingly difficult," the company said, in a media release.
 "Both Macassa and the Holt Complex have a significant number of employees and contractors resident in Quebec who travel to Ontario for work.
 "Essential activities at both operations, that will continue, are being completed entirely by a local, Ontario-based workforce."
 Kirkland Lake Gold has also announced that due to the reduction in operations, the company is withdrawing its 2020 guidance until further notice.
 The company's guidance for the year will be updated once normal operations resume.
 "At Kirkland Lake Gold, nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of our people and their families," said president and CEO Tony Makuch.
 "The COVID-19 pandemic represents a serious and unique challenge to citizens across the world.
 "We have been carefully monitoring the rapidly evolving developments related to COVID-19 and have introduced a number of proactive measures with the aim of protecting the people of Kirkland Lake Gold and the communities in which we live and work."
 The company has a COVID-19 Management Task Force that meets daily to assess emerging developments and identify new measures required to protect the company's people, their families and communities.
 At the Macassa Mine, the ongoing work is focused on production, as well as water and environmental management.
 Non-essential activities have been suspended, including exploration drilling, work on a new surface ramp and mill upgrades. Work on their new No. 4 shaft is continuing, at reduced levels.
 At Detour Lake, ongoing work includes the mill processing a reduced feed from the open pit and stockpiled ore and the management of water levels during the spring runoff, as well as other environmental activities.
 Approximately 300 people are still working on site, which is around 30% of their normal workplace during regular operations.
 A number of additional measures applicable to camp operations have been implemented at Detour Lake to protect workers, including processes for assessment, isolation and ambulatory evacuation of employees showing any kind of symptoms, increased food and hygiene safety, and a greater frequency of cleaning.
 The Holt Complex, which encompasses the Holt, Holloway, and Taylor Mines, as well as the Holt Mill, will be down until at least the end of April.
 Most of the 529 employees will be off work for the time being, with a very small number continuing work at Holt and Taylor.

HINGHAM -- A local group of friends has launched a Boston-area group aimed at feeding medical workers who are on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "It provides community for people and a way for them to give and to get involved," said Shelly Osterberg, a Hingham resident and the founder of Front Line Appreciation Group (FLAG) Boston.
 FLAG Boston is one of a network of similar groups around the country that raise money to buy food for medical workers who are treating coronavirus patients. Osterberg said she was inspired by a friend who started one in the Detroit area, who in turn was inspired by the first FLAG group, in Chatam, New Jersey.
 Osterberg said she watched as the group her friend began in her Detroit suburb grew over just a few days to involve the entire metro area.
 "At first, honestly, it was overwhelming. But it didn't take long before it sunk in that this was really something I would love to do," she said.
 She reached out to some of her friends from Hingham and a few surrounding towns-- she calls them her "lunch club crew"-- and the women quickly decided to start their own FLAG. Kathleen Thrun, Wray Clifford and Amy Crean of Hingham, Kirsty Nicholsan from Scituate and Carolyn Wright from Norwell all signed on to launch FLAG Boston.
 Like in Detroit and other cities, the group has grown exponentially in just a few days.
 The Boston group officially launched last Tuesday and already has raised more than $15,000, mostly through small donations of $5 or $10. As of earlier this week, they have delivered 100 meals and lined up more than 750 more to be delivered this week. A Facebook group of people looking to get involved already has more than 1,600 members from the greater Boston area.
 Organizers from Boston FLAG coordinate with local restaurants and supermarkets to purchase meals in bulk, which the businesses all individually package for maximum hygiene. Volunteers then drive the meals to area hospitals.
 So far, they've brought 100 bagels and juice from Atlantic Bagels to South Shore Hospital, and grocery store Euromart and Marshfield caterer Chef's Table have also both agreed to provide 35 meals each to the hospital. Local Hingham eateries like Green Light and Brewed Awakenings are also taking part. This week, the group will begin sending meals to Mass General Hospital, where a Hingham father is being treated in the ICU for COVID-19.
 Osterberg said the group is working on building up relationships with local restaurants to keep the meals coming. The group is working to create contacts at more local hospitals, so it can coordinate how best to help out the workers.
 The group wants to make sure they're working with restaurants that package food properly for minimum contamination and that it's delivered safely, with minimum human contact so workers and volunteers can practice social distancing.
 And, Osterberg said, members are trying to figure out what exactly workers at different hospitals need. Some hospitals are looking for hot meals, but some busy workers might have a greater need for protein shakes and snack bars they can eat quickly, she explained.
 Osterberg said community members and local businesses have been eager to help.
 "It's amazing how social media can spread things," she said. "Things are just popping up."

For anyone who’s spent time in Scotland’s highlands and islands, it’s a familiar sight. Footprints of subsistence farms and villages are scattered across the country, marking where communities were lost to the Clearances of the 18th and early 19th centuries, when landowners evicted tenant farmers. The story is more complex here: Rhenigidale expanded due to the Clearances, then shrank in the late 1800s as residents emigrated to Canada. It takes little imagination to picture the buildings’ former inhabitants walking to the bay to fish, or to streams to collect drinking water. I was riding not just in Kenny’s footsteps but in those of generations of communities who made a successful – if hard – living all along the coast.

Rev. Humphries added that how parents spoke to their children was also important.      “It can be helpful if parents are mindful of the way they phrase questions,” he said.      ““What’s on today?” or “What are the interesting activities that you are going to have on in [insert subject name]?” are likely to be better received and more encouraging, than “How much work have you got to do today?” or “Have you done all your work?””      “In saying that, it is good for parents to have copy of the timetable or work set, so that they can touch base with their kids and ask how things went or if they need help with anything. Finally, it is really unhelpful even if we think it might be funny, to photo bomb online lessons.”

WITH a plethora of online streaming services available, video stores are few and far between but Bowen’s Movie HQ are ticking along steadily and pledge to keep “kicking on”.
 Bowen’s Movie HQ is one of the last remaining stores in central Queensland, and with many small businesses struggling in the current climate, they are maintaining a “steady” flow of business.
 Owner Sunny Mahadevan said they have experienced a slight drop in trade with many isolating themselves at home and using online streaming services.
 But the drop was balanced out by the pensioners who didn’t have access to Netflix and those who may have exhausted the streaming services options, said Mr Mahadevan.
 “As far as business goes, with the little drop in trade, the Jobkeeper initiative will help us out heaps. It will get us through the next couple of months,” he said.
 Mr Mahadevan took over the business in 2002 and said there have been times he’s considered closing, but while the community continues supporting him, he’ll keep “kicking on.”
 “I came close to cutting it right back, but there are still customers coming in and you feel a bit of an obligation to them while they’re supporting you,” he said.
 “While I can, I’ll keep going as long as I can.
 “As long as the public is there, every small business is the same, you rely on the public, so for now we’re kicking on.”
 Mr Mahadevan said video stores were important in small communities, particularly for pensioners who may not have access to online services.
 “We do cheap Tuesdays which is great for pensioners and they generally don’t have Netflix,” he said.
 “You get people coming in asking for something we haven’t rented in ten or so years, something that’s not even available on Netflix.
 “It’ll probably be more of a video museum one day.”
 Mr Mahadevan said it was hard to know how many MovieHQ stores were left in Queensland, but said he believed he was the last in central Queensland and “probably one of the last in the state”.
 “We have a running joke about Steven Bradbury - we’re the last one standing,” he said.

“Very likely there’s a vast unsampled diversity,” he said.
 Copying mistakes aren’t the only way for new viruses to arise. Sometimes two kinds of coronaviruses will infect the same cell. Their genetic material gets mixed up in new viruses.
 It’s entirely possible, Boni said, in the past 10 or 20 years, a hybrid virus arose in some bat that was well-suited to infect humans, too. Later, that virus somehow managed to cross the species barrier.
 “Once in a while, one of these viruses wins the lottery,” he said.
 In January, a team of Chinese and Australian researchers published the first genome of the new virus. Since then, researchers around the world have sequenced over 3,000 more. Some are genetically identical to each other, while others carry distinctive mutations.
 That’s just a tiny sampling of the full diversity of the virus. As of April 8, there were 1.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the true total is probably many millions more. But already, the genomes of the virus are revealing previously hidden outlines of its history over the past few months.
 As new genomes come to light, researchers upload them to an online database called GISAID. A team of virus evolution experts are analyzing the growing collection of genomes in a project called Nextstrain. They continually update the virus family tree.
 The deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China. The Nextstrain team has also used the mutation rate to determine that the virus probably first moved into humans from an animal host in late 2019. On Dec. 31, China announced that doctors in the city of Wuhan were treating dozens of cases of a mysterious new respiratory illness.
 In January, as the scope of the catastrophe in China became clear, a few countries started an aggressive testing program. They were able to track the arrival of the virus on their territory and track its spread through their populations.
 But the United States fumbled in making its first diagnostic kits and initially limited testing only to people who had come from China and displayed symptoms of COVID-19.
 “It was a disaster that we didn’t do testing,” Heguy said.
 A few cases came to light starting at the end of January. But it was easy to dismiss them as rare imports that did not lead to local outbreaks.
 The illusion was dashed at the end of February by Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington, and his colleagues.
 Using Nextstrain, they showed that a virus identified in a patient in late February had a mutation shared by one identified in Washington state on Jan. 20.
 The Washington viruses also shared other mutations in common with ones isolated in Wuhan, suggesting that a traveler had brought the coronavirus from China.
 With that discovery, Bedford and his colleagues took the lead in sequencing coronavirus genomes. Sequencing more genomes around Washington gave them a better view of how the outbreak there got started.
 “I’m quite confident that it was not spreading in December in the United States,” Bedford said. “There may have been a couple other introductions in January that didn’t take off in the same way.”
 As new cases arose in other parts of the country, other researchers set up their own pipelines. The first positive test result in New York came on March 1, and after a couple of weeks, patients surged into the city’s hospitals.
 “I thought, ‘We need to do this for New York,’” Heguy said.
 Heguy and her colleagues found some New York viruses that shared unique mutations not found elsewhere. “That’s when you know you’ve had a silent transmission for a while,” she said.
 Heguy estimated that the virus began circulating in the New York area a couple of months ago.

Worley tosses the praise right back at Manring’s for his songwriting skills. “He was writing all kinds of nice hooky songs. Just hooky all over the place — he was writin’ ‘em left and right.” Kelly says he thought Manring’s tune “Life’s Little Problems” predated Dave Matthews by about 30 years. “Yeah, like I said, Hooky? My God!” Worley exclaims. “I’d say it even had kind of a Little Feat groove to it. Wasn’t really New Orleans, but had that nice beat, man.”
 The songs on the anthology, which Kelly, his younger brother Pat, and Manring have been working on for about three years, still stand up today. “I change my partner occasionally, control my baby astrologically,” Manring says snarkily on “Zodiac Waltz,” a Cajun-flavored, Appalachian-tinged, shape-shifting chunk of Americana before there was even a term for it. That’s Manring on the husky, soulful vocal lead, a skill he also demonstrated with David Sheppard as the B.R. Boys and later as a multi-instrumentalist and singer for the Swamp Cats. He now accompanies Laurelyn Dossett on tour and also serves as an instrumental jack of all trades from underneath the stage providing sound effects as well as the occasional onstage accompaniment to Dossett’s road company shows for the some of the six plays she helped create with Triad Stage’s Preston Lane.
 Kelly slithers around sinuously on “Samba,” supporting Bruce Swaim’s trilling flute. Kelly one of Tornado’s founding members, is also a revered sound tech and engineer who has helmed many local gigs and sessions. “I engineered and produced all three of the Swamp Cats’ albums,” Kelly says proudly, “and I engineered and co-produced the B.R. Boys record.” He has also toured with Johnnie Whitlock, Bob Margolin, Hubert Sumlin, Nappy Brown, a well as being a member of Blues World Order, and Mel Melton & the Wicked Mojos.
 One of Worley’s tunes, “Soot’s Lament” comes across like Neil Young fronting Stonesy country honk. Worley, also a founding Tornado member, had previously played with Fred’s Hat Band with Kelly. Another of his tunes on the anthology, “Hobos,” sounds like a cross between Tim Buckley and Crosby, Stills and Nash. “I would say that’s a fair assessment,” Worley says, “because they loomed pretty large, both of them.”
 The anthology displays a side of the Boys that early fans of the band might not recognize and some didn’t care for at the time. The band expanded and plugged in. Kelly’s brother Pat remembers the reaction of a friend of his brother’s coming back rather disgruntled from one of the early plugged-in shows. He said, “I went down to see the Boys, and they had all these amplifiers and electric guitars. It was almost like when Bob Dylan went electric — some fans weren’t all that pleased. ”
 The Boys brought in flautist/saxophonist Bruce Swaim, a preacher’s son from Winston-Salem who could blow like a demon, moving to D.C. and working with Danny Gatton, Martha Reeves, Millie Jackson, The Spinners, The Four Tops and The Temptations and currently fronting the Bruce Swaim Quartet. And to add some thump, David Licht came onboard. Licht would soon move to New York as a founding member of the globe-trotting Klezmatics, also playing with Bongwater and Eugene Chadbourne in Shockabilly, as well as with Itzak Perleman.
 The band added more percussive propulsion with Greensboro businessman Al Clinton on Congas, then took on Tom Wimbish on keys. Scott Sawyer lent his guitar skills on occasion, percussionist Frank Worrell showed up frequently as well.
 The music got funkier, and friendship with local drummer Chuck Cotton led to an invite to sit in with the band he was in, Funkhouse, who went on to become Betty Davis’ backup band, recording the album “Nasty Gal” with her. Betty was married to Miles Davis.
 “We finally got to where we connected with some of the guys we looked up to in the jazz community around here who were our elders, and then they wanted a piece of it,” Manring says of the Boys’ newfound funky side. “And it was cool as sin. It was liberating in a way without having to be a piece of commerce, just to play music like that.” And even though some might have had initial doubts about the young intruders, they soon won over the crowd. “You don’t dance into that world and dance around like you know something unless you can get in there and do it,” Manring says. “And we got in pretty good from time to time.”
 That’s evident on the tapes, as is the meticulous research and remastering efforts. Everybody thought that Manring had written”Greensboro Blues,” because he was the one who brought it to the band. But when it was time to list the credits for the songs, Manring denied ownership, revealing it was a David Olney tune he had recreated from memory after seeing him perform it live.
 “I never said I wrote it,” Manring said. “I was helping with the digital project and a lot of it was supplying the music actually,” says Pat, who had accumulated treasure trove of Boys tapes over the years. “Bobby kept saying we need to get David Olney’s blessing to use the tune because we don’t want this to turn around and have some legal suit on our hands.” Pat finally reached Olney through his website, and Olney gave his permission to use the tune. “He said something like, ‘I’m honored that yawl would be playing my tune.’”
 The music and the memories still endure. People still come up to Bobby and say they remember him from Sentinel Boys. “I had no idea anybody even had a glimpse of what that band was all about,” he says, seemingly surprised that people still wanted copies of the music. “Ironically, we had always recorded even our first rehearsals, down to every gig in some form or the other so we could learn from it. My brother became the archivist for that stuff and has the tapes I had given him and forgot about. He supplied a lot of material that Scott and I had forgotten about.”
 Worley says he’s gotten Sentinel feedback over the years as well. “I hear things. It was fun, man, it was just a real fun thing to do. And everybody loved it.”
 The project and the band mean a lot to Manring as well. “You don’t meet too many people like them. You don’t meet all these cats who have these real sophisticated tastes. And everybody was just really smart and cool and good and could do a lot of stuff — an amazing bunch of people. There were really pretty solid people, and I think our friendship today stands to speak for that.”

It was Friday, March 13, and Cate Dahlberg was joking around with her sister.
 “What if I had to cancel my wedding?” Dahlberg recalled asking.
 The next day she realized that canceling her wedding, which was less than a month away, was no longer a joke. Dahlberg talked with her mom and together they decided to move the date or at least contact the venue to see if it was possible.
 Dahlberg and her fiancé, Nithin Joseph, live in Edina. Dahlberg played volleyball all through high school and college. About four years ago she picked the sport back up and started playing in open gyms. She was invited by a man she met at an open gym to play with his team.
 She showed up at the gym to a team that consisted of all men from India, she said. She’s been on the team for over three years. Through the team she met Joseph. They have been together just over two years, she said.
 Dahlberg’s family was having a little get together at her sister’s house. It was April 28, her birthday. Joseph said he had to take a friend to the airport so he would be late. She arrived with her parents and her sister told her that a present was outside for her on the deck.
 She walked out onto the deck “and it was covered in flowers. Beautiful spring flowers. He’s standing there in the corner with a dozen roses,” she said. Joseph proposed while surrounded by Dahlberg’s family.
 “It was perfect,” she said.
 They started planning the wedding right away. She wanted most things arranged in the summer because she is a teacher in the Osseo School District. She knew once fall came she would have no time to plan. The wedding would be Saturday, April 4, and specifically planned around her school’s spring break the next week.
 In just a few months, they found their venue the Medina Entertainment Center, the church Lord of Light Lutheran in Maple Grove and met with photographers and florists. All before summer school started in July. “It was a pretty smooth process,” Dahlberg said.
 Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. A once smooth road now had a bump. Dahlberg knew that it was time, she said.
 Contacting the venue first, she was given a few available summer dates. She then called her photographer, Studio 220 Photography in Excelsior, as well as her florist and other vendors. “Within a few hours I had everything moved to a new date,” she said, adding “everyone was really understanding.”
 The couple was not charged extra fees to move their wedding date. They felt lucky that all the components of the wedding were all available on the same date, she said. “It ended up being much easier than I anticipated.”

BOSTON (AP) — Courthouses shuttered. Thousands of trials on hold. Legal deadlines pushed.
 The coronavirus pandemic has crippled the U.S. legal system, creating constitutional dilemmas as the accused miss their days in court. The public health crisis could build a legal backlog that overwhelms courts across the country, leaving some defendants behind bars longer, and forcing prosecutors to decide which cases to pursue and which to let slide.
 "Everybody is scrambling. Nobody really knows how to handle this," said Claudia Lagos, a criminal defense attorney in Boston.
 Judges from California to Maine have postponed trials and nearly all in-person hearings to keep crowds from packing courthouses. Trials that were underway — like the high-profile case against multimillionaire real estate heir Robert Durst — have been halted. Some chief judges have suspended grand juries, rendering new indictments impossible. Other have allowed them to sit, though six feet apart.
 Prosecutors may have to abandon some low-level cases to keep people from flooding into the legal system.
 Many judges are holding hearings by phone or video chat to keep all cases from grinding to a halt. Other courts are stymied by outdated technology. The clerk for the the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Molly Dwyer, likened the logistical challenges to "building the bike as we ride it."
 Judges have asked for emergency powers to delay trials longer than the law generally allows and extend key deadlines, like when a defendant must initially appear in court.
 That could keep people locked up longer, exposing them to unsafe jail conditions, and violate their constitutional right to a speedy trial, defense lawyers say.
 "We shouldn't be creating mechanisms in the current crisis to keep people in jail longer. The jails are just tinderboxes waiting for the virus to take off," said Jeff Chorney, deputy public defender in Alameda County, California. Courts there now have seven days instead of 48 hours to hold arraignments, during which a defendant is often appointed a lawyer and can enter a plea.
 The pandemic has shuttered nearly every aspect of everyday life as the death toll mounts and more states impose strict stay-at-home orders. There are nearly 400,000 cases and more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S., according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.
 Still, coast-to-coast disruptions of the courts system are unprecedented.
 In 2004, Hurricane Katrina forced courts in New Orleans to temporarily close. The suspension of legal deadlines after the natural disaster left thousands languishing behind bars for months without formal charges, attorneys say. Lawyers there fear a repeat.
 "On a regular day, without a crisis like Katrina and COVID, you can imagine people getting lost in a system like this," said Alanah Odoms Hebert, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana. "There will be a lot folks who fall through the cracks."
 No civil litigation is getting done. U.S. District Judge Steven Seeger in Chicago chafed at a recent request for an emergency order barring the alleged misuse of elf and unicorn drawings. "The world," he said, "is facing a real emergency. (The) plaintiff is not."
 The COVID-19 disruptions are causing widespread confusion with prosecutors and defense attorneys as they struggle to file documents, get matters heard in courthouses operating on skeleton crews and share information with jailed clients while maintaining social distancing.
 Lawyers for Elizabeth Holmes, head of the blood-testing startup Theranos scheduled to be tried this summer for allegedly defrauding investors, asked a California federal judge to also exempt them from the orders. They said the restrictions made witness preparation and serving subpoenas difficult. The judge refused.
 Attorneys are wary of visiting their clients in jails for fear of contracting the virus or spreading it behind bars. They rely on phone calls, which in some places are recorded, limiting what they can say.
 "You have to sort of chose between your safety and your client's safety ... or their constitutional rights. It's a really impossible situation," said William Isenberg, a Boston defense attorney.
 The haphazard operations could lead defendants to later challenge convictions, even if their lawyers did the best they could during the virus-related tumult.
 Courthouse chaos may worsen when the shutdowns end, as judges try to return to old cases while fielding a burst in new cases. A flood of lawsuits linked to COVID-19 will add to the logjam.
 "The courts are looking down the barrel of a real serious bottleneck," said Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. "I don't think anybody has figured out what they're going to do."
 Crime victims are also forced to wait. In Minnesota, the virus has postponed the federal trial of an Illinois militia leader accused of being the ringleader in the 2017 pipe bombing of a Minnesota mosque. Michael Hari's trial was already postponed once. Now it's scheduled for late July.
 Mohamed Omar, executive director of the mosque, said community members want to see quick justice, but that he understands the need for a delay.
 "The safety of our community and those that are vulnerable are more important to us now more than any other thing," he said. "This is bigger than all of us."
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in a few weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination in 2016, mounted a formidable 2020 bid.
 He raised astonishing amounts of money from record numbers of donors, becoming the front-runner early this year and earning the most votes in the first three state-wide contests.
 But he was eclipsed by a surging Biden, who won the vast majority of remaining primaries and now holds a commanding lead in the all-important race for delegates who choose the nominee.
 Sanders brought his liberal ideological platform — including a call for universal health care and a $15 hourly minimum wage — into the mainstream.
 "Together we have transformed American consciousness as to what kind of nation we can become, and have taken this country a major step forward in the never- ending struggle for economic justice," Sanders said.
 Several lawmakers have come out in support of his policies, and Biden has shifted leftward to incorporate some Sanders positions, although he does not support Sanders's Medicare for All plan.
 Biden immediately hailed Sanders as "a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country."
 He urged Sanders supporters to join his campaign, which already has the backing of nearly all other ex-rivals in the race including Sens. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, and former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg.
 "I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country," Biden said in a statement to Sanders and his supporters.
 "I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You're needed."
 Trump made his own pitch for Sanders's supporters, though in a more abrasive tone.
 "Bernie Sanders is OUT!" the president posted on Twitter, saying Senator Elizabeth Warren helped split the liberal vote by remaining in the race during key contests, thereby helping Biden, the Democratic establishment's clear choice for the nomination.
 "The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!" Trump said.
 Trump won the 2016 election with help from disaffected working-class voters who believed they were being left behind by politicians in Washington.
 Sanders also appeals to those voters.
 On Wednesday he warned the coronavirus was causing an "economic meltdown" that has resulted in millions of lost jobs and a scramble for many to regain access to health insurance.
 Sanders said he would not remain in an unwinnable campaign that would "interfere" with important anti-coronavirus work while the country is gripped by crisis.
 Biden said his focus is on ending the pandemic, but promised to continue campaigning despite the logistical challenges.
 "First things first: how we're going to keep America safe and get this crisis under control and provide economic assistance," he said during a virtual fundraiser.
 And he repeated a pledge to choose a woman as his running mate — a topic on which he said he has asked former president Barack Obama for advice.
 "I'm going to need a woman vice president who has the capacity, has strengths where I have weaknesses," Biden said.
 Sanders stressed he would remain on the ballot and seek to gain as many delegates as possible in order to "exert significant influence" over the direction of the party.

With more than 95per cent of Americans under "stay-at-home" or "shelter-in- place" orders, reports continue to mount of state employment offices being overwhelmed by a deluge of applications. Mike Ricci, a spokesman for Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that "we have approximately 1,000 calls coming through in every two hour period of time," noting that "currently, federal employees and people who have worked in multiple states cannot file online."
 RANKS OF UNEMPLOYED SWELLING
 As such, any moderation in claims last week would probably be temporary. The breadth of businesses shuttered because of the stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has expanded from bars, restaurants and other social gathering venues to transportation and factories. The United States has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world.
 Businesses are also encouraging their lowest paid hourly workers to apply for unemployment benefits to take advantage of an extra US$600 per week for up to four months. This enhancement is part of a historic US$2.3 trillion rescue package and is on top of existing jobless benefits, which averaged US$385 per person per month in January.
 It is equivalent to US$15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The federal minimum wage is about US$7.25 per hour.
 "The new US$600 Federal payment alone still exceeds average earnings in leisure and hospitality by almost 50per cent," said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
 "This may in turn be part of the reason why jobless claims have soared so rapidly in recent weeks. Workers may be more accepting of temporary furloughs if they stand to lose little income, and several major retailers have cited the new provisions when announcing layoffs."
 Thursday's claims report is also expected to show the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid shot up to 8.0 million in the week ending March 28 from 3.029 million in the prior week, according to the Reuters survey. That would obliterate the record 6.635 million hit in May 2009.
 The so-called continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag and is viewed as a better gauge of unemployment and its impact on gross domestic product.
 "The labor market has entered a traumatic period," said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. "We foresee the unemployment rate spiking to 14per cent in April."
 The economy is believed to have contracted sharply in the first quarter, with even an historic decline in GDP being forecast for the second quarter. Economists say the economy entered recession in March.
 The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.

Delving back into the archives to find out what happened to a lot of people from the past several decades is bound to turn up a lot of interesting facts and remind people that at one time these individuals were interesting enough to pay attention to. But time and a continually-changing industry do manage to erode the base that a lot of people have stood on for a while, and as a result those that are front and center and continuously changing with a constantly changing business are those that are going to be noticed more often than not. Ari is one of the many that a lot of us can possibly recall from our younger years but might have trouble remembering now unless we were fans back in the day.

If anyone remembers, the movie had to do with the character of Dutch Dooley, played by O'Neill, who had the unfortunate task of bringing Doyle Standish, a young and very snobbish kid played by Ethan Embry, back home to his mother for Thanksgiving. Long story short, the trip has its ups and downs as Doyle and Dutch continually try to understand and even one-up each other throughout the movie, but one of the funniest parts comes when the pair meet up with two young ladies by the name of Brock and Hailey, who just happen to be call girls that agree to give the duo a ride.

"For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look."
 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that the WHO "hasn't accomplished what it was intended to deliver" but stopped short of calling for Tedros to step down.
 Representative Chris Smith, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on global public health, said Trump was not talking about "defunding, as much as a pause" in WHO support to press for an investigation.
 "We need answers and the people of the world deserve a WHO that is absolutely transparent," said Smith, a supporter of robust US aid to fight diseases.
 "People in my district are dying. People all over the United States and Europe and elsewhere are dying because of what we think was very, very poorly handled, which is probably the most diplomatic way of putting it," he said.
 For the United States, a key criticism is how the WHO, quoting Chinese scientists, initially said there was "no clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission of the mysterious virus found late last year in the metropolis of Wuhan.
 Tedros in late January traveled to China to meet President Xi Jinping and praised Beijing's "transparency" and cooperation with the WHO.
 Smith said the WHO should have been "dogged" at a time that China was muzzling doctors including Li Wenliang, a COVID-19 whistleblower who later died of the disease.
 "When they accepted the Chinese government's line that there was no human-to- human transmission, there were people in Wuhan who were paying a terrible price for speaking truth to power," Smith said.
 "It's either a competency issue or there's some other agenda, and with the Chinese government there is always another agenda and the truth is always the first casualty," he said.
 Trump himself had said in January that the virus was "totally under control" in the United States, later adding it may go away in April due to warmer temperatures.
 The United States has since recorded more than 14,700 deaths, with most of the population under some form of lockdown.
 As criticism mounted of his own response, Trump heavily condemned Beijing over what he called the "Chinese virus."
 But his tone stepped up against the WHO after he spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping and reached a truce with the Asian power, which supplies much of the medical equipment needed in the United States.
 Trump — whose tough line on immigration is a signature issue — in particular has taken umbrage to the WHO's initial criticism of his ban on visitors from China.
 The WHO said as of late February that such bans were ineffective and warned of "negative social and economic effects," but much of the world has now imposed major restrictions on travel.
 J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the WHO deserved some criticism for its "gushing" praise of China and delay in declaring a public health emergency.
 But he said it was important to be realistic about the limited leverage of the WHO, especially when faced with a major power such as China.
 "What is going on here, I believe, is that this is part of the Washington blame game," Morrison said.
 "This is the WHO getting caught in the middle of a worsening U.S.-China confrontation and an increased effort by Washington to deflect attention away from Trump."
 Morrison said that Tedros had proven his competence, including the former Ethiopian foreign minister's successful efforts to fight Ebola in Africa.
 "It would have had no backing from the U.S. or other powerful states if it had chosen to be confrontational with China at those key moments," Morrison said of the WHO.
 "It would have simply had its access terminated."

By Ravi Gopalakrishnan With the onset of 2020, two factors have led to the unprecedented corrections in stock markets globally. One, the spread of the Covid19 virus. Two, the meltdown in oil prices. Both these factors have affected the market sentiment and contributed to the high volatility. The frontline Nifty50 index witnessed its biggest single day correction on Mar 23, 2020, with a 13% negative return. The full impact of the virus on society and its consequent impact on the economies across the world remains largely unknown. Governments across the world have announced fiscal and policy stimuli in a bid to mitigate the economic impact. However, these steps are currently unable to calm the financial markets. The fears, in our assessment, will subside once the governments get a better control – on both the spread of the virus as well as progress in finding a cure/vaccine. Oil prices have added to the volatility in global financial markets. The moves by Saudi Arabia -large price discounts to its Asian customers and threats to increase production in a bid to defend its market share- have unnerved the oil and financial markets and oil prices are hovering at 18-year lows, leading to large scale redemptions from Sovereign Wealth Funds across the world. Amid the current negatives, India seems in better control of the situation in containing the number of Covid-19 cases. This containment can be largely attributed to the early ban on flights imposed by the government, especially from major Covid-19 affected countries like China and Italy. Also, the 21 days countrywide lockdown is expected to help in curbing further spread of the disease. As the dust settles down, it is believed that India, along with a few other developing economies like Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia are poised to benefit from the expected recovery in the global economy. We believe most global businesses would look to diversify their manufacturing destinations outside China to mitigate the country and concentration risk. Another sign of positivity comes from the institutional investors’ cash flows. For the last five financial years since FY2016, the DII net flows have been positive. This trend of DIIs investing is unprecedented and points to the growing strength and significance of domestic institutional investors in the Indian equity markets. According to Motilal Oswal research, the net fund flows from DIIs (FY 16 to FY 20 is about USD 62.5 Billion) while the net fund flows from FIIs during the same period has been USD 11.2 Billion. Additionally, the Indian equities across capitalization and sectors are at attractive valuations. For example, Nifty 50’s trailing price to earnings (PE) ratio is 19.3 (as on March 31, 2020), a level last seen in February 2016. The Price to Book value of Nifty 50 currently is 2.45 (as on March 31, 2020) closer to the levels last seen in February 2009. We believe that it is as good a time as any to be investing in the equity markets. Thus, this provides a good entry point to the investors who have been fence sitting, waiting for opportunities to invest at lower levels and attractive valuations of equities. Almost all segments of the market have been impacted in the recent market decline and have seen significant corrections in the last couple of months. In our view, as the market starts to recover from the pandemic effect, the large caps should be initial beneficiaries as usually seen during recovery phases of markets. Quality companies with strong fundamentals would be expected to recover once the volatility subsides. High quality midcaps and small cap companies are also expected to follow suit. In the current conditions, we suggest mutual fund investors should consult their wealth/financial advisors and adopt a calibrated approach to stagger their investments over the next three to six months. A good strategy, as always, would be to use systematic transfer plan facility by investing a lumpsum in fixed income funds and switching to equity funds as advised by their advisors. Systematic investment plans (SIP) are also a good and convenient route to continue investing in equity funds. We believe advisors should continue to stick to the financial goals and consequent asset allocation plan of their investors while allocating to different asset classes.

It's their identity, their way of life, their cart path to success.
 A restaurant or bar can take a huge step toward profitability off the business it generates in a single week. An ahead-of-its-time industry sprung out of the locals renting their homes to strangers to accommodate the influx of fans, sponsors and media. From ticket brokers to impromptu parking-lot attendants, it seems everyone in the east Georgia city of 200,000 has figured out a way to make a buck off the first major golf championship of the year.
 But the Masters is more than just commerce. Relationships are made out on the course, over a pimento cheese sandwich perhaps. Or afterward, over a late- night bourbon and cigar. Then, the whole cycle repeats itself, year after year, decade after decade.
 In some ways, it has the feel of a family reunion.
 "We obviously do a lot of business that week,” said Mark Cumins, who 35 years ago co-founded one of the city's most famous restaurants, TBonz steakhouse, right down the road from Augusta National Golf Club. "But it's not just the money. People have been coming for a long time. We like ‘em. Even though it’s a busy, busy, busy week, it's a good time. That's what makes the Masters special.”
 Of course, this tradition unlike any other is on hold at the moment. The coronavirus pandemic has killed thousands, forced nearly everyone to hunker down in their homes, and shut down sporting events around the world.
 For the first since a three-year hiatus during World War II, the Masters won't be held in its usual slot on the calendar, serving as sort of an unofficial kickoff to spring.
 The tournament is now set for November, when all those booming drives and tricky putts will be accompanied by the changing leaves of fall rather than azaleas blazing forth in all their colorful glory, the hope of spring replaced by the gloom of an approaching winter.
 Everyone wonders what an autumn Masters will look like, what the world will look like in seven months.
 "We don't what the know rules will be,” Cumins said. "Are people even going to want to go out to crowded places?”
 Until now, Masters week always coincided with spring break for Augusta’s schools, largely to accommodate another tradition that predates the Airbnb era. Many locals clear out of their homes for the week, heading off on vacation and freeing up space for all those visitors who couldn't possibly be handled by the city's limited hotel space.
 Even that comes with an extra Augusta touch.
 Since the tournament doesn’t end until early Sunday evening, and most of those renters need to stay on until the next morning, the schools tacked on an extra day to the week-long break. The kids don’t have to resume classes until the Tuesday after the Masters.
 "Of my friends, I would say probably 80 to 90 percent rent out their homes, and have been for years," said Suzi Hall, whose two-story home is just a few kilometers from the course. ”It's a huge industry."
 For at least 15 years, Hall and her husband have rented their five-bedroom house to a contingent of AP reporters and editors covering the Masters.
 Their two daughters were little girls when that tradition began.
 Now, one is married, the other just completed graduate school.
 Washington Road is usually the epicenter for Masters week, a hodgepodge of sprawling strip malls, fast-food joints and, of course, John Daly, who sets up his camper in the Hooters parking lot to sign autographs, pose for pictures and sell all sorts of kitschy merchandise.
 This week, the parking lot is empty other than barriers adorned with hastily drawn signs, showing customers where they can pick up to-go orders.
 The hoopla of the Masters stretches beyond Washington Road. A few kilometers away, the French Market Grille would normally be in the midst of doling out spicy Cajun cuisine to packed houses. Instead, owner Walter Clay has been making dinners for laid-off employees who need all the help they can get.
 "During the Masters, we do a month's worth of business," said Clay, who also owns another popular restaurant, Raes Coastal Cafe. "Then we do another month's worth over the next three weeks. That's nice. It's like running a business with 12 months of expenses but 13 months of revenue.”
 The Masters has a trickle-down effect on the entire Augusta economy.
 For instance, all those homes that are rented out require extra cleaning services during the week. Those jobs aren't needed at the moment, of course. That's a financial blow to some who can least absorb it.
 "This is a game changer for a lot of people," Hall said.
 Indeed, this is a city that marks time by its signature event.
 How many days until the Masters?
 Then, as soon as it's over, they start counting down again.
 Now, all they can do is wait.

Maj. Barber fought in both World War II and the Korean War. On January 20, 1942, he volunteered for the U.S. Marine Corps and in April of that same year, PFC Barber departed for the Pacific. He participated in landing assaults against strongly defended Japanese positions on islands of the Guadalcanal group in the British Solomon Islands. The First Marine Division, to which he was assigned, completely routed all the enemy forces and seized a valuable base and airfield in the Solomons. His division received their first Presidential Unit Citation for their gallantry and resolve in successfully defeating the enemy.   Promoted to corporal, Barber was again in the thick of a landing assault over a treacherous coral reef against hostile mortar and artillery fire when the First Marine Division seized the island of Peleliu. By their individual acts of heroism, their aggressiveness and their fortitude, the men of the First Marine Division received their second Presidential Unit Citation for these actions, while Cpl. Barber was awarded his first Purple Heart for a shrapnel wound received during the battle.   After being discharged from the U.S. Marine Corps, he enlisted as a corporal in the U.S. Army. A member of the 82nd Airborne Division when the Korean War started, Sgt. Barber answered the call for ranger volunteers and began training at Fort Benning, Ga. Joining the 3rd Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne) on October 4th, 1950, Ranger Barber served as platoon sergeant of the 2nd and 1st platoons during the first and second training cycles of 3rd Company.   Arriving in the Korean War zone on March 24th, 1951, the company was attached to the 3rd Infantry Division. On April 11, 1951, the company was given the mission of spearheading the division advance. Clearing the village of Kantonghyon, Ranger Barber’s platoon was crossing open terraced paddies and came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire against a well-defended enemy hill. Assuming command of the 1st Platoon when his platoon leader was wounded, Ranger Barber led his Rangers in a bayonet assault on the enemy entrenchments. Although wounded by a grenade fragment, Ranger Barber encouraged and led his men in continuous combat as they responded with individual acts of bravery, entered the enemy trenches, killed approximately 17 enemy and captured one prisoner. Only eight Rangers (three not wounded), were able to continue onto the final objective 2,000 yards away and seize the hill (Bloody Nose Ridge).   For his aggressive leadership and gallantry in action this day, Ranger Barber was awarded the Silver Star and recommended for a direct commission. Ranger Barber was commissioned a second lieutenant on December 29th, 1951, and served on active duty and continuous jump status until his retirement on July 1, 1965.   His personal actions and leadership in combat clearly demonstrated that Ranger Barber lived the Ranger motto of displaying the intestinal fortitude required to fight onto the Ranger objective and complete the mission, though I be the one survivor. Rangers lead the way!   In life, Maj. Harold L. Barber would have shied away from having his accomplishments touted. He was a quiet, humble man that was fun to be around but seemed uncomfortable with attention that focused on him. However, it would be difficult not to acknowledge that Maj. Barber received two purple hearts and was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame located at Fort Benning, Ga., in 2006.   Maj. Barber kept close to his Bulloch County roots when he met and married Bobbie Mae Spence from Portal.   He is preceded in death by his father, Howard Harold Barber; his mother, Allie Parrish; his first wife, Bobbie Mae Spence Barber; and his second wife, Mary Jimmy Jackson Barber. He is also predeceased by a son, Grover Earl Johnson Barber; a daughter, Brenda Kay Barber Newcomb; and a son-in-law, Mark Barronton.   Maj. Barber is survived and will be greatly missed by his sons, Harold Spence Barber of Ohio (Marla), William Keith Barber (Patti) of Statesboro, David Ronald West (Karen Minor) of Newnan and Joseph Russell West of Griffin. He will likewise be eternally loved and remembered by his daughters, Sandra Faye Barber Lewis of Statesboro and Deborah Eileen West Barronton of Newnan; his brother, Larry H. Barber of Atlanta; and his sister, Patsy Boatwright of Texas. He is also survived by several grandchildren, great-grandchildren, great-great-grandchildren and nieces and nephews.   In light of the current situation, a celebration of life will be held at a later date.   Deal Funeral Directors, Statesboro, Georgia, is in charge of arrangements.

On Monday, ASUS unveiled its Tablet 600, the first official Windows 8 tablet powered by Nvidia's Tegra 3, quad-core CPU.

Yesterday, (April 8, 2020) Rohan turned a year older. Yes, it was the actor's 'Happy Wala Birthday' and he received wishes from all over. How could his BFF Hina miss to send him lovely wishes to him? Just like every year, without fail, the actress took to her Instagram handle to share a sweet wish for the young actor. She shared an adorable collage of their pictures. The photos were from YRKKH as well as their off-screen masti. Along with it, she wrote, 'Happy Birthday dear Rohan. You know I love you tons.' Well, we must say Hina surely knows how to keep her near and dear ones happy. And we miss seeing the on- screen mother-son duo.

 Scapegoating is nothing new of course. There are probably cave paintings somewhere which show that the woolly mammoth was at fault when the sabre- toothed tiger strolled through the middle and buried a header past the caveman.
 Fast forward a few thousand years and plenty of fans decided Mauricio Taricco was garbage before he went on to become one of the best attacking full-backs in the club’s history.
 And who can forget people falling out over whether James Scowcroft was any good (he was, by the way). Even Sir Bobby had to endure people jeering him early in his tenure as Ipswich boss.

 So it’s not a new problem, but the Internet has allowed us to spread our scapegoating far and wide. We can even track the player in question down on Insta and harass them until they make their account private.

We started riding from Rhenigidale, climbing tarmac for 100 metres before turning on to a track just wide enough for single-file footsteps or cycle tyres. With the coast to our left, the track contoured above cliffs and around small coves. I stared down through the still and clear sea, strangely calm despite the brooding weather. I passed through the remnants of the long- abandoned buildings of Gèarraidh Lotaigear, just a few hundred metres from the start of the path and once home to the only shop in Rhenigidale.

India’s case is strange for several reasons. First, experts believe India has a much less severe public health crisis due to Covid-19 than many peer emerging-market economies, as well as advanced economies. Second, the lockdown does not guarantee prevention of the spread of the virus, and even it works well, there will be a relatively minimal benefit in the reduction of the spread of infection.

It rained, of course. But that was fine. I was watching on television April 26, 1989, nice and dry. Sometimes, I’ll slip and catch myself talking about that night as if I was in the ballpark as a newly minted 12-year-old. I have to forgive myself, because I’ve heard so many stories about that night, I feel like I was there.
