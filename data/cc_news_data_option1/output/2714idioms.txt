WORCESTER -- Several Central Massachusetts police chiefs Friday urged state lawmakers to slow down a wide-ranging police reform bill, saying they wanted more public debate and to ensure that the legislation will "get it right."


  "My primary concern is the speed at which everyone is trying to pass this bill," Auburn Police Chief Andrew J. Sluckis Jr. said in an interview Friday afternoon. "This bill is going to affect everybody that lives in Massachusetts, and it deserves careful, thoughtful, debate, and we don't have the ability to do a redo so I feel strongly that we need to get it right the first time."


  Worcester Police Chief Steven M. Sargent concurred, saying in a statement that he had "serious concerns with some of the proposals" in the bill.


  "I hope law makers will take time to properly debate and discuss the proposals with law enforcement agencies and the general public," Sargent said in the statement. "I believe that rushing sweeping reform legislation could create unintended negative results."


  Meanwhile, the president of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association has also weighed in.


  "The bill is a far-reaching extreme change to law enforcement practices," Jeff W. Farnsworth, president of the MCOPA and chief of Hampden Police, said in a statement.


  Farnsworth noted that the organization supports creating a Police Officers Standards and Training (POST) program as Gov. Charlie Baker has proposed in his own legislation.


  However, Farnsworth said "the Senate's version, while including their version of POST, includes much that we as police leaders find problematic and should receive appropriate review and discussions to fully understand the implications of the bill that is not possible in such a short time."


  "We do not support the expedited passage of the Senate bill that now has 145 amendments attached which further complicates an appropriate review," the statement concludes.


  The proposed Senate bill would create an independent oversight and investigatory body to hold police accountable and create a system to certify law enforcement officers at all levels of government, with clear guidelines on the use of force by police. Law enforcement officers would also be newly required to intervene if they witness police misconduct and submit to racism training.


  The bill would also impose a temporary ban on facial recognition technology, codify the prohibition on racial profiling in law enforcement, eliminate a requirement that police officers be present in schools, and expand access to expungement for young adult offenses.


  The 73-page bill was put together in the weeks since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and nationwide outrage and protests over police violence and systemic racism. Both Democratic lawmakers and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker have identified police reform as a priority.


  But on Thursday, and again Friday, Senate Republicans -- led by Sutton's Ryan Fattman -- blocked debate on the proposed bill. Fattman has said that the lack of a public hearing on the bill and the limited time given to members to review the legislation -- introduced Monday -- warranted the delay.


  The move by Fattman on Friday pushes off debate until at least the next formal session, but Senate leaders did not immediately say when that would be.


  "Everyone in this senate -- everyone -- wants a good police reform bill that makes sense and is effective because your life matters; I believe that, the senate believes that, and people outside this building believe that," Fattman said in a speech on the floor of the Senate that addressed both police officers and "victims of injustice or brutality," on Thursday.


  "But the truth is, this bill as I've outlined, had no hearing, had little to no input from numerous stakeholders."


  Meanwhile, Democratic leaders said that a public debate was the best way to vet the bill.


  "The Senate is going to stay focused on what we set out to do with this bill: protect the lives of our Black and brown residents from systemic racism and institutionalized violence," said Senate President Karen Spilka and Sens. Sonia Chang-Diaz and William Brownsberger in a statement Thursday night. "We know that these conversations are difficult, and the actions we're called to take will not be easy, but it is our responsibility to begin to respond to the voices who have called on us to make these changes. We welcome further discussion on the very important provisions of this bill -- and the right way to do that is to proceed with debate on the bill and its amendments."


  "The president's office, Ways and Means, myself, we met with stakeholder groups from law enforcement and wove their input into the bill," Chang-Diaz said Friday after the bill stalled a second time. "Does it have everything they want? Of course not. Does it have everything that people from Roxbury want? Of course not, and I have to live with that discomfort. But to suggest that this process did not attempt to bring people together, I'm calling B.S. on that. People were at the table."


  Away from Beacon Hill, both Sluckis and West Brookfield Police Chief C. Thomas O'Donnell said Friday afternoon that they felt the legislation contained a mix of good and bad and, in some cases, well-intentioned but perhaps not applicable measures.


  For instance, Sluckis said the ban on chokeholds was "fine to have in there," but said that Massachusetts officers are not trained to use chokeholds.


  Moreover, he criticized calls for data collection, for instance, data from traffic stops that do not result in a ticket.


  "It's a knee-jerk reaction to things that happen with respect to racial profiling in other parts of the country," Sluckis said. "Here in Auburn, racial profiling does not happen and doesn't exist. I can't speak to other parts of the state, but here it is not a problem."


  And both Sluckis and O'Donnell said they worried about the impact of the bill's calls to limit qualified immunity, which shields government officials including police officers from civil lawsuits unless their conduct violates "clearly established statutory or constitutional rights."


  Critics of qualified immunity argue that it makes it virtually impossible for police officers to be held liable for illegal actions.


  "It protects you if in good faith you make a mistake," O'Donnell countered, advocating that people misunderstood qualified immunity. "It never ever protected people who went out and did the wrong thing for the wrong reason..."If (the section on qualified immunity) passes in its present language, I think you'll see a lot of people leave the profession."


  Sluckis agreed.


  "If officers are afraid that their actions could cost them monetarily or they could be sued and lose their houses, I think it will make them more hesitant to go out and do jobs effectively," Sluckis said. "You can't do police work with the threat of losing your house constantly looming over your head. It makes it very, very difficult."


  The two had different takes on requiring police officers to be certified.


  "(POST)'s been a long time coming, and I think most people in law enforcement recognize and welcome it -- it's the standard in most of the country, and there's no reason that Massachusetts can't join the rest of the country in that standard," Sluckis said.


  Meanwhile, O'Donnell noted that police departments could already become accredited in the state, and wondered how that would mesh with certification, as well as how part-time officers (as are depended on in West Brookfield) would get certified.


  But both chiefs expected -- and welcomed -- that reform legislation would eventually be passed...they just expressed the wish that it be a more slow process.


  "I think it's well intentioned, a start in the right direction," O'Donnell said. "But like anything else, I think everybody's in such a rush to be seen as doing something and getting something done, and not paying attention to some details."


  And O'Donnell echoed Sluckis' comments that they wanted the legislation done right.


  "I think for something this important...there is an obligation to do things right the first time," O'Donnell continued.

To Whom it May Concern:


  As an employee of Ozark School District for more than 20 years, I have worked both personally and professionally with Aaron Johns for the last 12 of those years. His role has been as a school board member and mine as a school administrator. Mr. Johns’ family has lived in Christian County for five generations. This expertise regarding our community has assisted him as a civic leader.


  Mr. Johns is dedicated to the students and staff of our school. He is a strategic thinker and often contemplates our next steps. He has challenged our school leadership to be on the leading edge — to do the best we can for our students.


  Ozark School District is very fortunate to have the support of our community, however, like many, we have difficult moments. Mr. Johns has been a major player in helping the school district navigate through these rough times. He has served on many committees to improve policies and procedures and to help the district efficiently allocate funds provided by tax payers. Mr. Johns stresses doing the best we can with what has been provided to us.


  In working with our $60 million budget, his focus is to wisely apply each dollar to meet our mission and vision. His leadership calls for strong teamwork. Every year, school districts receive external audits. Ozark schools have an impeccable record — no deficiencies noted — we have even received commendations. Aaron Johns’ leadership has assisted in these great results.


  At the beginning of the school year kickoff, Mr. Johns addressed 700-plus faculty members. In his speech, he communicated the importance of teamwork and compared the success of our team to the spokes of a bicycle wheel relating that if any of the spokes were out of line or missing, the wheel would not function properly. He reiterated that it takes every spoke for the wheel to glide smoothly. Mr. Johns has worked hard to build a great team at Ozark schools and I have no doubt he would do the same as Christian County treasurer.


  Sincerely,


  Chris Bauman


  Superintendent, Ozark School District

A local man facing multiple charges out of Essex County was freed from jail to lodge at the Colonnade Inn in Lyndon.


  Jason Fournier appeared for a court hearing in St. Johnsbury on Thursday to say he can stay at the Colonnade for at least the next two weeks. Judge Michael Harris had earlier granted Fournier a 24-hour pass from jail to find a home. He was told to report to the courthouse at 3 p.m. on Thursday to let the court know if he was successful. Absent a suitable lodging location, Fournier faced being put back in jail.


  Fournier faces eight pending charges out of Essex County, including felony charges of burglary and grand larceny. He also has criminal convictions from Caledonia County and is wanted in New Hampshire for a burglary at TJ’s Truck Stop in Lancaster in June 2019.


  Through his attorney, Laura Wilson, Fournier argued for a chance to get out of jail long enough to find someone to take him in. He claimed he couldn’t do an effective outreach for lodging while being held in jail. One of the options he suggested was one night at the Colonnade Inn in order to seek a longer-term living scenario where he would be restricted by a curfew. Additionally, he offered to wear a GPS ankle monitor. Both of those things happened.


  Against State’s Attorney Vince Illuzzi’s objections, Judge Harris freed Fournier on Wednesday and told him he had one day to find a place to stay. Fournier spent Wednesday night at the Colonnade. He was told to get to the courthouse for a 3 p.m. hearing on Thursday to communicate the results of his home search.


  He arrived on time for the hearing after taking the RCT bus from Lyndonville to St. Johnsbury. Wearing a face covering, he appeared before Judge Harris in the courtroom. Joining the hearing via video conference were attorneys Wilson and Illuzzi and Mike Carlisle, from the probation and parole office.


  It’s Fournier’s probation for convictions in Caledonia County that make the GPS monitoring an option.


  Judge Harris was satisfied with Fournier’s efforts to secure the Colonnade as a home for two weeks, and with probation and parole confirming the GPS monitoring, the judge allowed Fournier to remain free while being restricted by a series of conditions that include a curfew. He is allowed off the Colonnade property between the hours of 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. each day if he is using the time to look for his next home, look for a job or get groceries.


  “It sounds like you’ve got a good plan,” said Judge Harris to Fournier. “You’ve made efficient use of less than 24 hours and you gave priority to what I told you to give priority to … you have 14 days with very good prospects to go forward. Thank you for that progress.”


  Illuzzi maintained his objection to Fournier’s freedom, claiming that Fournier continues to lack any concrete plans to find suitable, long-term lodging while his case proceeds through the judicial process.


  “He told the court that he was going to do plan A and of course that no longer is in the works, now it’s public housing at state expense for some unknown location in the future,” Illuzzi said. “I’m not sure that’s what was told to the court the other day when we had this hearing and I continue to object to his release…”


  Illuzzi will have a chance to further argue for Fournier’s pre-trial incarceration on July 17 at what’s called a weight of the evidence bail review hearing. Illuzzi is looking for Fournier to be determined a habitual offender and will seek a hold without bail order.


  Fournier said he will get himself to the hearing next week. He said he’s glad to be out of jail and credits Northeast Kingdom Community Action for being willing to work with him on the lodging. “NECKA is working with everybody and they’re doing a pretty good job actually helping stuff around here,” said Fournier.


  He said his work search will likely be for construction jobs.

Moonrise Cinemas is an oasis.


  The newly launched drive-in theater offers Northeast Kingdom residents a break from COVID-19 concerns, political turmoil, and the everyday stresses of life in 2020.


  “What we’re trying to create here is a new normal,” said co-founder Saturn Roblee of Glover. “When people pull through the gates, we want them to let go of what’s happening outside the drive in.”


  Moonrise Cinemas is a pop-up business that will be hosted by the Orleans County Fairgrounds from July 8 to Aug. 2 and the Caledonia County Fairgrounds from Aug. 5 to 30.


  For movie listings and more information visit MoonriseCinemas.com.


  It is Roblee’s brainchild. She grew up going to The Delevan Twin Drive-In Theatre in upstate New York.


  For years, she and her partner Cavan Meese talked about opening a drive-in of their own. Then the pandemic struck. That created a need for socially distant, family friendly entertainment that could unite community.


  Weeks after having a son, Roblee and Meese decided to make their drive-in dream a reality.


  The enlisted longtime friends Emily and Tito Ladd, who moved to the area (after a quarantine with their three-year-old child) to lend a hand.


  All four have entertainment and production backgrounds, and their seasonal gigs had fallen through. They worked for a month and a half to prepare for their opening.


  When Moonrise Cinemas launched on Wednesday, with a double feature of The Addams Family and Knives Out, Roblee felt a wave of nostalgia.


  “Seeing cars pull in on the first night, people setting up lawn chairs and ordering popcorn, it was a happy sight,” she said.


  It was the product of a lot of work.


  In six weeks, they developed a plan, secured locations, obtained permits and licenses, purchased equipment, lined up sponsors (including the St. J Automotive Company), scheduled films, created safety protocols, and sorted out the logistics (including ticket and concession sales).


  “There are hundreds of individual elements,” Meese said, adding, “It was a lot of perseverance and a little bit of luck.”


  Movies will be projected onto a 52-foot inflatable screen. They purchased one, but a production delay left them scrambling. They rented one (also 52 feet) to cover the first week until the other one arrives.


  Meese said a large screen was key to the experience.


  “We decided it had to be big in scale,” he said. “We don’t want it to feel like a backyard movie theater. We wanted a full drive in experience.”


  Meese said the local fairgrounds were natural partners.


  They were large properties with ample power, water, parking and infrastructure designed to host ticketed events.


  What’s more, the fairgrounds had canceled their summer schedules and were in need of events. So they eagerly welcomed the drive-in movie concept.


  “The fairgrounds around here are such awesome organizations of volunteers, everyone works hard to maintain the facilities so that once or twice a year everyone can come and enjoy them,” Meese said, noting the Orleans County Fairgrounds normally hosts a Fourth of July celebration and the Orleans Country Fair in August. “When we came to them saying we have something we think we cold do, they were immediately so excited about it. It was the same with the Caledonia Country Fairgrounds. Everyone involved in the fairgrounds is passionate about it and supportive. They were happy to use the space for something.”


  Moonrise Cinemas runs from Wednesday though Sundays. Gates open at 6:30 p.m. and there are double features on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.


  General admission tickets are $25 per vehicle for up to five people and an additional $10 for each passenger beyond five. Senior tickets (60 and over) are $15. Tickets can be purchased online (moonrisecinemas.com).


  Maximum capacity at the Orleans County Fairgrounds is 150 cars.


  Vehicles park in 200-square foot spaces where people can sit in, on, or around their vehicle. Audio is broadcat over an FM radio frequency. Transactions are touchless and social distance is maintained throughout the experience.


  The kitchen offers theater favorites like popcorn, nachos, hot dogs, ice cream sandwiches and candy. Food can be ordered through the web site. Items can be delivered directly to vehicles, or picked up outside the kitchen.


  There will also be a full service bar starting on July 15 that will offer beer, wine and mixed drinks. It will be created with assistance from those who have operated beer gardens at the fairgrounds before.


  “We wanted to make it a place where everyone in the community could have something to do and experience a wonderful night,” Roblee said.


  On its opening night, the moon literally rose from behind the screen.

BURLINGTON – Ariel Quiros, who the government maintains was the ring leader of a major federal EB-5 investment fraud in the Northeast Kingdom, plans to withdraw his not guilty pleas, his new lawyer revealed Friday.


  Defense attorney Neil G. Taylor made the surprise disclosure at the start of a U.S. District Court hearing in Burlington.


  “We have been cooperating with the government and we anticipate disposing of his … case by plea in the immediate future,” Taylor told the court.


  After the hearing he told the Caledonian-Record details must still be worked out with prosecutors and Quiros wants to make explain “how the wheels came off” for the major development.


  “He has been waiting to tell the story,” Taylor said about Quiros. “He wants to make amends.”


  The terms of any possible plea bargain still need to be negotiated, according to Taylor, who took over as the main defense counsel for Quiros last month.


  “We have been working pretty diligently with the government,” Taylor said. “We do not have an agreement.”


  It was unclear when a signed agreement would be executed or when the court might set a date for a change of plea hearing.


  The revelation by Taylor appeared to catch the other lawyers for the co- defendants off guard at the hearing.


  The trial for Quiros, William Stenger and William Kelly is scheduled for Jan. 21, 2021. It was set for Oct. 5, but got bumped earlier this year.


  Quiros, who owned Jay Peak ski resort, pleaded not guilty in May 2019 to 12 felony charges, including 7 counts of wire fraud and 3 counts of false statements.


  Burlington lawyer David Williams, co-defense lawyer for Stenger, said he wants to ensure Quiros gets sentenced before any trial is held for his client.


  Stenger will want to have Quiros called as a trial witness if the prosecution doesn’t use him in its case, Williams said.


  “We’d like the jury to hear what Mr. Quiros has to say,” said Williams, who is defending him along with Brooks McArthur.


  Taylor, in the phone interview, said he would expect prosecutors would want his client to tell the full story when they present their case.


  McArthur told the Caledonian-Record after the hearing he believes if Quiros testifies truthfully, Stenger will be found not guilty.


  Williams said if Quiros was unavailable a request to postpone the trial would be made.


  Chief Federal Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford said there should be enough time for the change of plea, a presentence report and a sentencing hearing before the trial.


  The prosecution has predicted it would need 15 days to present its case. The defense believed it would need 4 to 6 days, but it is unclear what the change of plea might do to the trial length.


  The indictment centers on the scheme to develop a biotech facility, AnC Bio in Newport, as part of a series of ventures the businessmen undertook under the federal EB-5 investor program.


  Quiros, 64, of Key Biscayne, Fla. appeared at the hearing by video on Friday, but did not speak.


  Stenger, 71, of Newport, the resort’s former president and CEO, has denied 10 criminal counts.


  Kelly, 71, of Florida and an adviser to Quiros, has pleaded not guilty to 10 felony counts.


  A fourth defendant, Jong Weon Choi, a South Korean businessman, remains at large. He is named in 10 criminal counts in the indictment. The government has said Choi, who operated AnC Bio in Korea, was a “hidden partner.”


  The hearing on Friday was designed to give the prosecution and defense a chance to spar over how much specific information had to be disclosed before the trial.


  As the hearing began, Taylor dropped the bombshell saying there were plans for disposing of the case “in the immediate future.”


  Taylor then added he would become a “passive” on the motion, which had been filed by his predecessor, New York City lawyer Seth Levine, in February.


  Before a hearing could be conducted, Levine petitioned in May to withdraw from the case. Crawford later found “that Mr. Quiros is significantly in arrears in paying his attorneys,” and granted the motion.


  Williams then took the lead at the hearing asking for the “bill of particulars” for the case since the government has shared 2,900 potential exhibits.


  “It should not be finding the Easter Egg out in the woods,” Williams stated.


  He was soon joined by Kelly’s defense lawyer, Robert M. Goldstein of Boston, who noted they had more than 3 million pages of documents. He said the government could certainly give an idea of the documents it planned to rely on to try to prove the case.


  Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul J. Van de Graaf maintained prosecutors had provided sufficient information and it should not be pinned down now on what documents might be used several months down the road.


  He said the documents are searchable and the prosecution has met with defense lawyers multiple times to discuss the case.


  Crawford took the arguments under advisement. He said they would have another video conference in two weeks.


  The government has said the fraud began about 2008.


  The witness list includes U.S. Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders, Rep. Peter Welch, former Vermont Governors Jim Douglas and Peter Shumlin.


  They have been strong supporters of the EB-5 program that allowed non- citizens to obtained immigration papers in exchange for $500,000 investments in businesses and additional jobs.

Instead, the new streamer was on board with offering money for post-production, special effects, scoring, and even some ADR to add / change dialogue, but that was it.

  NIA registered the case under sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, against four persons — Sarith P.S, Swapna Prabha Suresh, Fazil Fareed and Sandeep Nair.


  “The aforesaid consignment was found camouflaged in diplomatic baggage from UAE that is exempted from inspection as per the Vienna Convention. The said consignment was to be received by Sarith, who had worked in the UAE Consulate earlier as Public Relations Officer. Initial investigation by Customs Department has revealed that Sarith had received multiple such consignments earlier as well,” the NIA said.


  As the case pertains to smuggling of a large quantity of gold into India from offshore locations, threatening the economic stability and national security of the country, it amounts to a terrorist act as stated in section 15 of the UAPA, it said. “Further, as the case has national and international linkages and as the initial enquiries have revealed that the proceeds of smuggled gold could be used for financing of terrorism in India, NIA has taken up the investigation of the case.”


  Earlier, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had petitioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an “effective and coordinated” investigation by “all Central agencies concerned.”

Harrison and Victor have the same body types. Perhaps Harrison puts on some weight this year but remember, he's going to enroll at Ohio State in December. Therefore, it's most likely he'll weigh somewhere in the 180-pound neighborhood when he gets to Columbus, as did Victor back in 2016.


  Both are willing downfield blockers who have no problem laying a defender in the dirt who failed to keep his head on a swivel. Both are red-zone options with elite catch radii. That's about where the similarities end, however.


  To me, the biggest difference between these two coming out of high school is Harrison is considerably faster now than Victor was then. As a matter of fact, I'm willing to put up this month's paycheck that Harrison Jr. would outrun Victor in the 40-yard dash right now if you put them both on the laser. At the NFL combine, Benjamin's best 40-time time was 4.61. I'm going to assume that in the months leading up to the draft he hired a trainer to help him manufacture that time. On January 9, 2020, Harrison clocked an impressive 6.82 in the indoor 55-meter dash at the Briarwood Running Camp Holiday Invitational in Haverford, Pennsylvania. Shout out to his track coach. That time translates to about a 4.55 in the 40-yard dash. Harrison is still very lean and can add to his speed with discipline in the weight room.


  Another thing that differentiates Harrison from Victor is his field cognition. Victor was raw coming out of high school. He was bigger than everyone else and just Mossed highschool defenders and was often too much to bring to the ground with the ball in his hands. Harrison, on the other hand, exhibits an understanding of how to manipulate defensive backs using route principles. He knows how to sit down in the zone, how to stem his routes into a defender's blind spot, and looks better getting in and out of his breaks. He's also bigger than everyone else, Mosses people, and is hard to bring down as well.


  While both were ranked inside the Rivals100, Harrison is ranked 49 spots higher. Victor was supposed to be drafted in the third round, based on his rivals ranking of 91st in the nation, but ended up being an undrafted free agent signee with the New York Giants.


  Harrison is ranked at 42 which means Rivals believes he will be selected in the second round. I was high on Victor coming out of Coconut Creek back in 2016. In fact, I thought he was underrated so I am in no means taking a shot at the national analysts. When it comes to Harrison I think his ranking is right on the money.


  My assessment of Harrison is that he's a long rangy receiver who can stand add about 15 to 20 pounds of muscle to his frame. His track times manifest to his game speed. While he's a high hipped long strider, he's not stiff and looks twitchy. He posses a large catch radius coupled with a natural ability to track the ball as well as go up and high point it and bring it down in a crowd. He's also a willing an effective blocker whether he's cracking down on a linebacker or stalking a defensive back downfield. Harrison is one of the most complete receiver prospects in the country and his blocking ability could lead him to jump out ahead of the pack and see the field before others vying for a spot on the depth chart.

They put their heart and souls on the line and declared – as loudly as their voice boxes could – that they were with me. All the way!

"Curiosity can't drive entirely without humans in the loop," Matt Gildner, rover driver and member of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a statement. "But it does have the ability to make simple decisions along the way to avoid large rocks or risky terrain. It stops if it doesn't have enough information to complete a drive on its own."

"Parlamentarii PSD, două săptămâni înainte de trecerea la faza a doua a stării de alertă au anunțat public că nu vor vota prelungirea stării de alertă, după care și-au dat seama că au comis-o grav și că nu au înțeles nimic din riscurile aferente acestei epidemii. Nu cred că sunt eu în situația să comentez niște declarații ale unor reprezentanți ai PSD care literalmente au făcut un uriaș rău românilor, care prin ignorarea pericolului reprezentat de acest virus, prin propaganda deșănțată pe care au derulat-o pentru ignorarea regulilor aferente, prin toate acțiunile pe care le-au întreprins către alte instituții, au provocat literalmente un risc major pentru ca oamenii să se îmbolnăvească, sunt o amenințare la adresa sănătății cetățenilor români și la adresa vieții cetățenilor români. Acestă lege este fundamentală. În toate țările democratice din Europa, în America, există pentru autorități instrumente ca izolarea, carantina (....), a afirmat Orban.


  Șeful Guvernului a mai afirmat că această strategie de a bloca, pas cu pas, eforturile făcute în direcția adoptării unui set de măsuri, poate avea efecte dramatice.


  "În prezent nu avem pârghii legale ca să putem dispune izolarea la domiciliu a persoanelor care au intrat in contact cu o persoană infectată. Nu va puteți da seama ce înseamnă asta”, a precizat Orban.


  Proiectul de lege privind carantina și izolarea ar urma să intre, sâmbătă, în plenul Senatului, care este și cameră decizională, după ce a fost din nou modificat, la solicitarea PSD.
