In the match between Delhi and Punjab, Marcus Stoinis was the standout performer for the former as he played an innings of 53 runs off just 21 balls to take Delhi''s total to 157/8 in the allotted twenty overs.Then, Punjab needed just one run off the final two deliveries in the match, but Stoinis was able to take two back-to-back wickets to take the game to a Super Over."I think it was incredible batting by Stoinis. He played an unbelievable inning towards the end to get us to a respectable total, and I thought Shreyas and Rishabh batted extremely well together to get us out of that hole early on," said Rabada."What a day Stoinis had - he bowled two full tosses and got two wickets so it was his day. And from there, I think we took our opportunity to win that game," the pacer added.The South African also said that it was nice to be under so much pressure in the first game as he reflected upon the team's first match."Unfortunately our top order couldn't do it this time, but we know all of them are quality players and will click in the upcoming games.

I think we've got to be vigilant. In most of the interviews I do about LGBTQ issues, people always say, “Isn't it great? We've come so far.” And I say, yes, but we haven't come far enough. We still don't have equality. You know those places in America where you can still be fired for your sexuality or your gender orientation? You know, black trans women are being killed at an alarming rate; The life expectancy for a black trans woman in America is 35 and that's not because they're dying of diseases. That's because people are killing them who hate them, so I feel there’s a long way to go. I think the most important thing is not to be complacent and to be vigilant about the little things that are happening: a ban here, a health care ban there. You know that this administration does not like people who are, in their view, different. And I am different, and I am worried about what could happen if Trump gets in again. So, yes, we can get married and yes, we can do things that we would that we might never have dreamed of, even a relatively short time ago. But we still don't have equality and we still don't have the respect that most straight people don't even have to think about.

Archer has also conceded 616 runs, and bowled 491 deliveries in total.Meanwhile Dhoni, who made his IPL debut in 2008, has played in 191 matches, notching 4,432 runs at a strike rate of 137.76. He has a high score of 84. He has also notched 23 half-centuries, hitting 297 fours and 209 sixes along the way.In their first match of IPL 2020, Dhoni came into bat very late, facing only two balls in the victory for CSK. He sent Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran ahead of him.Archer's usage in the last over for RR could well be against CSK's captain, depending on the circumstances. Dhoni is known to dismantle any kind of bowling attack, but his age could play a role.Currently, 39 years old, Dhoni looked out of sorts occasionally with the bat during the 2019 World Cup. Archer, 25, is considered to be one of the fastest bowlers in the world.The encounter between the two will be an exciting one, and could be the deciding factor in the match.

Stalin called together his closest comrades-in-arms. “I understand you’re wondering how I govern the people so that every last one of them … thinks of me as a living god. Now I’ll teach you the right attitude toward the people.” And he ordered a chicken brought in. He plucked it live, in front of them all, down to the last feather, down to the red flesh, until only the comb was left on its head. “And now watch,” he said, and let the chicken go. It could have gone off where it wished, but it went nowhere. It was too hot in the sun and too cold in the shade. The poor bird could only press itself against Stalin’s boots. And then he tossed it a crumb of grain, and the bird followed him wherever he went. Otherwise, it would have fallen over from hunger. “That,” he told his pupils, “is how you govern our people.”

There is a high possibility that Archer could be taking on CSK captain MS Dhoni, famous for winning matches in such situations . Other than Dhoni, the rest of CSK's batting line-up will also face Archer's wrath but in Twenty20 matches, each bowler is only afforded four overs. With both teams looking equal on paper, Smith could reserve Archer for the death overs. Both teams will face each other at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.
