Another blocker is failure to recruit the right talent. “There’s always a danger in corporate innovation that when somebody comes up with a great idea, a senior manager just assigns a few people to work on it who happen to be nearby or not particularly busy at that point. It’s almost a case of using whatever spare capacity they have, rather than putting the right creative, entrepreneurial people in place,” Lambert continues. “And that’s disastrous.” As is the next “deadly sin” which is neglecting to build enough on-going, internal political support to see the new venture through the turbulence that innovation and experimentation inevitably involves.


  ## The trap of legacy thinking


  Finally, and perhaps most crucially, innovation can be holed below the waterline by cultural deficiencies. “It’s very easy to say ‘No idea is a bad idea’,” he adds, “but if you’ve got the wrong culture, the moment a bad idea is put in front of 20 people, it will get shot down in flames in a very public way. That then prevents other people with ideas from sharing them. So you do need to create not just a group of people who are tasked with thinking creatively, but a whole culture where constructive challenge and risk-taking are actively encouraged.”


  If large companies can steer clear of these pitfalls, however, then they are far better placed than startups to innovate their way to new opportunities at scale, says Lambert. Research by business strategist Kaihan Krippendorff, in association with Wharton Business School, found that contrary to received wisdom, “only eight of the 30 most transformative innovations were first conceived of by entrepreneurs; 22 were conceived by employees.”


  In other words, legacy businesses are teeming with talent – it simply needs to effectively be set free. And the much-derided scale and seemingly arcane processes which make many big corporations slow to reach decisions can, in fact, offer a range of “unfair advantages” that no go-it-alone VC-backed startup can ever hope to match. How? By combining them with deep in-house expertise, global networks and customer bases, a trusted brand, laser-like focus on the customer and experience at navigating compliance and regulatory issues in multiple territories.

Shahlon Silk Industries, a leading textile player, has realised ₹18.50 crore from dilution of non-core asset, a land measuring 22,619 square meters, under compulsory acquisition by the government for Vadodara Mumbai Express Highway.


  The proceeds would be used to reduce debt to the tune of ₹12.50 crore, and the remaining ₹6 crore for working capital and strengthening the balance sheet.


  Dhirajlal Raichand Shah, Chairman, Shahlon Silk Industries, said there has been a strong recovery in sales because of the overall improvement in retail and e-commerce sales while markets continue to recover from the slowdown caused by the pandemic.


  Moreover, the company’s exports are back to 75 per cent level of its pre- Covid levels and is expected to normalise soon. Furthermore, dilution of non- core asset has enhanced cash flows of the company to the tune of ₹18.50 crore.


  The company reported a net profit of ₹39 lakh in September against loss of ₹6 crore in June quarter. Revenue from operations was at ₹crore against ₹10 crore in Q1 FY21.


  EBITDA increased to ₹6 crore, against loss of ₹30 lakh in Q1 FY21.


  The recent Production Linked Incentive scheme announced by the government is a major step, and being one of the leading man-made fibre and technical textile players, the company stands to gain from incentives for manufacture and export of specific textile products, he said.

From a young age, Katelyn Arnold, of Topeka, understood what it felt like to be on the outside looking in.


   


  As a child struggling with social and generalized anxiety, Arnold had a difficult time socializing with her friends, holding a simple conversation over the telephone and ordering food at a restaurant.


   


  When Arnold's mother, Darlene Morgan, recognized that her daughter's anxious tendencies went beyond what she was capable of supporting. She knew it was time to seek outside help.


   


  Arnold was in the fifth grade when she first started meeting with a therapist -- a difficult task for someone who didn't like speaking to others -- through Family Service and Guidance Center's anxiety treatment program.


   


  Easing Arnold into the program, Family Service and Guidance taught her how to manage her anxiety, how to move past it and get through it.


   


  Arnold recalls those early days of the program when her therapist would push her outside of her comfort zone to perform a task that may seem simple to most, but created anxiety for Arnold.


   


  "I remember two weeks into doing therapy, one of my exposure therapies was to order my own food at Taco Bell, and that was terrifying," Arnold said. "I had to go in there alone and walk through an order, and I didn't want to do that, but I did it. Afterwards, I was on top of the world. I was so proud of myself, so when I had to do that again, it just got easier and easier."


   


  Those undesirable situations that a therapist put Arnold in at an early age has helped her become who she is today.


   


  Arnold, now 17 and a high school junior, excitedly and proudly boasts about her group of friends and being a member of her school's theater program, which allows her to sing, dance and act on stage in front of a large group.


   


  Without FSGC's anxiety treatment program, Arnold isn't sure where she would be today.


   


  "This program has made such an impactful change on my life ... " Arnold said. "If you would have told me in fifth grade, 'Hey you're going to be on stage in a few years doing things in front of groups of people,' I would have not believed you at all. Now I can and I love it. I enjoy it and it's not as much of a chore as it used to be anymore."


   


  While Arnold still battles anxiety, she now knows how to control and handle it and "live freely without this kind of shackle around me," she said.


   


  FSGC's anxiety treatment program has been in existence since 2011. It is the only program in Kansas that specializes in treating kids and young adults suffering from high levels of anxiety.


   


  According to Crystal Scott, program coordinator for the anxiety treatment program, FSGC serves 100 to 150 kids through the program each year.


   


  The treatment's length varies and depends on the child, Scott said, but the average treatment protocol is about three months and includes 12 to 16 sessions.


   


  "So what we do is what we call cognitive behavioral therapy using exposure response prevention," Scott said. "We help them kind of recognize some of their anxious symptoms and some of their anxieties though patterns and recognizing how to challenge those in a more productive manner."


   


  For example, if someone is exhibiting anxiety about driving over bridges, they may begin to worry about the bridge collapsing under them. In order to move past the worry, a person would need to find evidence to support if the bridge will crumble while they are driving over it versus evidence as to why the bridge won't fall.


   


  "Then the exposure prevention part is where we say let's test it out," Scott said. "So we engage in the behavior that we are kind of scared to do."


   


  Therapists might begin with imaginal exposures before working someone up to driving over a bridge, or in Arnold's case, ordering food from Taco Bell.


   


  The anxiety treatment program can meet the needs of kids from the age of 3 to 18, and while anxiety is common in kids and adults of all ages, it is when the anxiety reaches a high level and takes over daily life that it becomes impairing.


   


  "If you're seeing your kid not going and doing stuff that they used to do, they used to love and they seem to be scared to go do stuff, if you're seeing them reporting some symptomatic symptoms -- like their stomach hurts, their head hurts all the time so they can't go do stuff -- those are warning signs that maybe you should call and see what's going on," Scott said.


   


  While the program hasn't necessarily seen an influx in kids suffering from anxiety related to circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, therapists have been noticing anxiety presenting itself differently.


   


  "So we are having kids who are anxious about social situations, but we are also seeing kids who are able to do remote learning, which means they are avoiding some of those things that trigger anxiety," Scott said. "So maybe it's not as big of a problem right now because they're not having to face it. Long-term, I can see that being potentially problematic."


   


  Arnold is one who has experienced her anxiety manifest itself in new outlets because of the global pandemic, but she has been able to find ways to challenge those feelings and worries.


   


  A tool that Arnold became familiar with when she first started the treatment program, and still uses today, is called probability versus possibility.


   


  "You have a scenario in your head and you say, 'Could this happen? Yes, there's always a chance it could happen,' so that's a possibility," Arnold said. "But probability, is it really going to happen? You kind of have to put it into perspective and think it could happen, there's always the chance, but is it realistically going to happen? So figuring out those percentages in my head just kind of clicked something in my brain and it helps me put things into perspective."


   


  The program has also allowed Arnold to open up and speak with friends and peers about anxiety and mental health -- topics that hold a strong stigma and are difficult for many to discuss.


   


  "Once you start talking about it, it creates a movement and people realize that they aren't alone and they have outlets and there are other people experiencing the same things as they are," Arnold said. "I think a lot of people, and I kind of had this issue, they don't want to be seen as vulnerable or weak and they want to seem like they have everything together and that they are just fine. I get that, I've been through that, but my mom would always tell me, 'It's not weak admitting that you're not OK. It's a strong thing to do to break down and say I need help. It's strong to do that.'


   


  "There's nothing wrong with that. You're human, but a lot of people don't feel like they have a safe place to do that or they don't have a support system to help them with that and they just don't want to admit it. When you admit it, then it becomes real to people and they don't want it to be real."


   


  For Morgan, Arnold's mom, she is proud that her daughter uses her experience with anxiety to break barriers and talk to people who are uncomfortable with the topic.


   


  Morgan is also grateful to the the treatment program for bringing her daughter out of her shell and making her more confident.


   


  "It's really been beautiful ... " Morgan said. "It's not like I'm even seeing the same kid, same young lady. She's doing things now that I would never in a million years have thought she would ever be able to do. She makes it look easy."


   


  The treatment program also taught Morgan, who felt like she has exhausted every method in helping her daughter, how she was negatively reinforcing Arnold's anxiety.


   


  "Some of the things that I had been doing, not intentionally, were reinforcing her anxiety," Morgan said. "I really had to change my parenting and how I managed her symptoms when she would have anxiety. It was really a learning curve for me to be able to help her as a parent."


   


  When Arnold would start to feel anxious, Morgan would tell her it was OK and there was nothing to worry about. The program taught Morgan that she was rationalizing her daughter's anxieties.


   


  "I could tell her it was OK or it was no big deal, but those things were real for her," Morgan said. "So now when she has those times when she might be anxious about something, my natural instinct as a mother is to reassure her, to sometimes rescue her, and that's not what you do with anxiety. You let her sit with it and work through it and have that experience."


   


  Having to take a step back and watch her daughter struggle through her anxiety is difficult as a parent, Morgan said, but knows she has to let Arnold work though it herself.


   


  "She used to call me from school saying she was anxious about something," Morgan said. "For Katelyn, her anxiety was often presented in a physical symptom, so she would say, 'I feel sick, my stomach hurts, I have this pain,' and as a parent, you want to rescue it, you want to take her to the doctor every time that she says she doesn't feel well. That was just reinforcing it and it was a difficult line to walk to know when is this real and when is this anxiety. Again, as a parent, the program really taught me how to figure that out. It's very powerful."

  • Jermall Evans, convicted of first-degree robbery.


  • Jahzeel Fenton, convicted of first-degree assault, domestic violence. Fenton was 17 years old when he shot a woman in the stomach in front of her young children in March 2010.


  Fenton was arrested and charged with attempted murder. Six years after the shooting, he entered an agreement with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to the lesser assault charge.


  He was sentenced to 20 years in prison in July 2017 and ordered to pay the victim’s medical bills of more than $162,000. Fenton appealed, and the V.I. Supreme Court affirmed his 20-year prison sentence in Nov. 2018.


  • Jahni Hamilton, 33, convicted of voluntary manslaughter, first-degree assault, and possession of a dangerous weapon. In 2015, Hamilton pleaded guilty to stabbing fellow Golden Grove inmate Adrian Wheatley to death inside the prison on July 9, 2011.


  At the time of the homicide, Hamilton was serving a 20-year sentence for the brutal 2003 beating of a woman in her Jolly Hill home when he was 16 years old. Police said he beat the woman with a piece of lumber and then stole more than $1,000 from her.


  She suffered a fractured skull, brain damage, broken ribs and broken wrists.

Many farmers in Nigeria are already used to hybrid seeds, which have been around for some time now, and which need to be purchased each season as opposed to the common age-old practice of saving some of your harvested grains to replant as seeds. So I really find this a non-issue, mainly because majority of farmers now do purchase certified seeds and get better yield and make more money. The incredible work of the National Agricultural Seeds Council cannot be over-emphasised. I have seen data that points to the availability and usage of certified quality planting materials on the rise. In any case, some corporates sign agreements with farmers not to save or share GMO seeds they purchase from them but in many public sector projects over the world, like the Water Efficient Maize for Africa, farmers are free to save and share GMO seeds and no royalties are charged.

  Sunday trading laws were first introduced under the Sunday Trading Act in 1994.


  It means large retails can only trade from 10am to 6pm.


  These rules apply in England and Wales only with a number of exemptions such as pharmacists, shops at airports, railways and service stations.


  A Department for Business spokesman told Mirror Money trading times are under review.

Rooster, Turk, Mercury, Bobber and I are 13 years old. We're riding our bikes fast and single file down the well-worn path along Bean Creek on our way to the old swimming hole at the park on the north edge of town.


   


  We've already ridden past BA Beach and Harry's Hole, two other favorite places to swim, but they were both already occupied by some younger kids. It's a hot day.


   


  We stop to talk to Sinclair Lattimer and Earl Buckmaster, a couple of our friends, who are sitting on the bank of the river holding fishing lines in their hands. There are fishlines with hooks and bobbers stashed all along the route, so anyone in the mood to fish a bit can stop about anywhere.


   


  "Catchin' anything?" says Turk.


   


  "One little one. Didn't keep it," says Earl


   


  "There's a big 'un in here," says Sinclair, always the optimist. "I'm not givin' up 'til I catch 'im."


   


  We pedal on. When we get to the old broken dam at the overgrown park, there's are three older guys splashing around in the swimming hole.


   


  "Zook's Mill," says Mercury, who's leading the parade. We continue, now on the washed-out two-track road leading out of the park, headed for the last swimming hole, nearly a mile away.


   


  We need to ride north a quarter mile and then turn on a gravel road and go north a half-mile before riding up another path through the woods to the high bank of the swimming hole at Zook's Mill. If there ever was a mill there, no trace remains but for the name.


   


  At last we find an unoccupied beach and in less than a minute, our clothes are tossed on top of our bikes and we're splashing around in the cool water. All of our swimming holes are clothing optional, but we've never exercised the "clothing" option as we never plan that far ahead.


   


  After a bit, Mercury and Bobber scramble halfway up the steep clay bank on the bend of the river and start digging a cave, as if they are cliff-swallows. Rooster, Turk and I put our clothes back on and begin building a fort, on the inside edge of the riverbend. We're dragging fallen branches out of the woods to our construction site, arranging them tepee fashion on the muddy soil.


   


  This work goes on for some time. We have one particularly large branch to put up and need a little help.


   


  "Hey, you guys," says Rooster, shouting to Mercury and Bobber. "Come help us."


   


  There is no answer. We look up at the clay cliff and all we can see is a collapsed tunnel with four feet sticking out, kicking furiously.


   


  We all splash through the river and climb up there, grabbing feet and pulling our buried friends out of the mud.


   


  Thirty minutes later, our fort is completed to our satisfaction. We ride home, knowing it will be destroyed in due course -- it is the law of the creek -- by other kids visiting the swimming hole and seeking to build their own fort. We mount our bikes and pedal homeward.


   


  "You've been at the creek," says my mom when I walk in the house, muddy and smelling of woods-and-creek. "At least you're not smoky."


   


  "Our matches got wet," I say.


   


  My dad always forbids me to play by the creek, but Mom grew up here, so she understands the law of the creek.

NOV. 23, 1846


   


  On this day, water flowed into the Augusta Canal for the first time.


   


  It had not been an easy process. Soon after civic leader Henry Cumming announced his canal plans in 1844, critics raised an outcry.


   


  They griped about its cost, its route and its usefulness. The Legislature got involved. The courts got involved. But the canal got built. Not only that, it worked brilliantly.


   


  The Augusta Manufacturing Co. would soon hire 200 workers and each week produce 32,000 of cottonyards of cloth.


   


  In the canal's heyday during the mid-1800s, an estimated 25,000 bales of cotton a year moved along its banks, either mule-drawn by barge or in Petersburg boats - cigar-shaped cargo vessels.


   


  During the Civil War, the canal served to power the Confederate Powderworks. Today, the canal is a National Heritage Area.

All the same, Huawei's Chinese rivals smell blood in the mid-to high-end phone market. In August a Huawei executive said the company will not be able to produce its flagship processors that power its high-end smartphones.


  "What we can see now, whether from Xiaomi, Oppo or Vivo, is that they're raising their forecasts for next year," said Derek Wang, an executive in charge of production at handset maker Realme, which shares a supply chain with Oppo.


  "They believe the sanctions against Huawei will more or less hurt it in the international market, and they may want to take a share of the market from Huawei."


  Founded in 2018, Realme is on course to double its smartphone shipments to 50 million this year, Wang said. It has built a base with low price-offerings in Southeast Asia and India, and is looking to target Europe and China next year with a push into the high-end market, regardless of Huawei's situation, Wang said.

Australia’s big-hitting opener David Warner on Monday said his “days are numbered” in international cricket and continuing an approach of keeping his aggression in check, he would rather ignore than engage if Indian players attempt to sledge him during the upcoming series.


  Warner, in a virtual press conference facilitated by the series’ official broadcaster Sony, touched upon his evolution as a batsman in the past couple of years.


  “I’ve just recently turned 34, so my days are numbered. When you’re in the 30s there’s obviously a risk element but there’s obviously a cricket smarts element to it as well,” the explosive opener said ahead of the limited-overs series against India starting with the first ODI on November 27.


  Warner, who has had his share of aggressive on-field showdowns, said he would prefer to look the other way if Indians try to get chatty with him.


  “I’ll always draw from that mate. To try and get engaged, that’s the way they like to play as well,” he said.


  “We’re learning over time, trying not to engage in that. Probably try and reversing the effect by trying and ignoring it, trying to take it on board and using it against them by using your bat,” he added.


  “It’s probably something I’ve learnt over time. And you don’t know the effect it can have on your teammates as well. You’ve got to be a bit more humble in that respect.”


  Warner said at 34, he has become a calculated risk-taker and is focussed on maintaining a strong strike rate.


  “For myself, it’s about getting off to a good start and taking calculated risks in that middle-overs period if we’re talking about 50-over games,” he said.


  “For me, it’s about making sure that I am batting as much as I can and at a good strike-rate as well. I think last year was probably the most disciplined I’ve batted in Test match cricket as well.


  “I really took pride in the last 12-24 months, to apply that discipline and you keep learning as you get older...You’ve got to be on top of your game to be able to adapt to that.


  A lot of this discipline has come fatherhood, said Warner, crediting his children for the gradually-acquired patience.


  ”...not get too aggressive or angry when the kids aren’t listening. For me, I am getting tested on and off the field. So, it’s about being calm and relaxed and trying to sum up the situation you’re playing in,” he said.


  “And making sure, you’re taking that right risk at the right time. I think last 12-24 months, I’ve been doing that quite well,” he added.


  “Make sure you’re not bringing people down with your emotions and keep trying to find ways to get better as a player and as a team player.”


  Talking about the Indian team, which will not feature in-form opener Rohit Sharma at least in the ODIs and T20Is, Warner said it would a big hole to fill but Virat Kohli’s men do have the wherewithal to manage.


  ”...obviously he is a big piece of their team, that they are going to be missing, but they have got great in-form guys KL Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan and Mayank (Agarwal), these guys played in the IPL, so you have got guys who are in good touch,” he said.


  Indian captain Virat Kohli will be flying back to India for the birth of his first child after the first Test, starting December 17 in Adelaide, and Warner lauded the decision.


  The batting main-stay also had words of praise for India’s Test vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane and said he brings a calm and measured approach.


  Asked how different the Test contest would be with Rahane expected to lead after Virat leaves, Warner said, “He’s calm and very measured in his approach. He’s got a very good cricket brain.


  ”...it’s like chalk and cheese with them two (Kolhi and Rahane) and as a player to try and engage him on the field, as we’re talking about engaging, and getting into that contest as players, it’s obviously lots to think about how to do that especially with Ajinkya as captain.


  “The great thing from India’s perspective is that you’ve got three if not four very good players who could captain the team at any time. With him, he’ll bring a calm and measured approach with his nature.”


  Warner was seen playing aggressively at the back end of the IPL and he stressed that he won’t be changing his game.


  “Yeah definitely. What do you want to see? 100 of 10 overs or something? (laughs). In the one-day stuff, I’ll still come out and play the way I normally do. There’s probably going to be no change to that,” he said.


  “Here in Australia, it’s a bit different, in 50-over cricket, you can still play the normal way you do and I think I showed that last year, the way I played against Pakistan and Sri Lanka.


  “I played pretty much the same way as I did during the backend of that IPL. I won’t be changing my game and will go out and tackle it the way I always do,” added Warner, who has 5,303 ODI runs.


  The series will be aired on Sony Ten 1, Sony Ten 3 and Sony Six channels from November 27, 8 a.m. onwards.

But suppose the Bomb was indeed militarily necessary to win the war? I have not met a single person who supports the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, who would justify the up-close-and-personal murder of a child for the same reason--even to win a war. But somehow the act of killing the same child and non-combatants--men, women, children--is "the correct choice" when we target them with bombs from an altitude of 20,000 feet? The greater the distance, the easier it is to keep a crime from stinging a conscience. Out of sight, out of mind. But God's ways are not our ways. The Fifth Commandment indicts, or consoles: Thou shalt not murder.

With the initiative then a more credible threat, the rest of the industry was willing to come to the table as California State Senate Majority Leader Bob Hertzberg drafted a last-minute bill that kept most of the initiatives power but offered big tech companies a chance to soften it in following years. Reed was the core of the group that worked on that bill, Hertzberg told Reuters.


  “This initiative would not have happened without Bruce, theres no question. He took it seriously when everyone else didnt,” Hertzberg said.


  Reed's position on 230 could prove more controversial. In a book published last month, “Which Side of History? How Technology Is Reshaping Democracy and Our Lives,” Steyer and Reed co-authored a chapter that called 230 an enemy of children. Though 230 had allowed tech freedom to flourish, they wrote that it has now gone against the desires of its backers by giving companies a financial incentive to encourage hate and abuse.


  “If they sell ads that run alongside harmful content, they should be considered complicit in the harm,” Steyer and Reed wrote. “If their algorithms promote harmful content, they should be held accountable for helping redress the harm. In the long run, the only real way to moderate content is to moderate the business model.”

  The winning recipient of the 50/50 will take home half of the pot, to the tune of $495,900. The rest will go towards the fund created by the Winnifred Stewart Association, a group that empowers people with disabilities.

It all started with a bowl of soup. The weather was a bit nippy, and we wanted to have something that was light but hot. We’d have soup for dinner, we decided, and I started surfing the Net to see where I could order from. To my great joy I found that Fa Yian was delivering to my part of town.


  I have old and fond memories of Fa Yian. Among all that I miss in these pandemic times are a Mumbai friend’s Delhi visits. He used to follow a pattern that we had to stick to, no questions asked. We would go for a meal to one of his favourite restaurants, and order the dishes he loved. ‘Have something else if you wish to,’ he’d say, but he looked so sad when he said this that we never went beyond the script. One of his haunts for a long spell was Fa Yian, in Connaught Place (A Block 25/5, Middle Circle; Ph: 9899358888 011-41516788).


  The good thing about the pandemic is that Fa Yian’s food is coming home, so we can order what we wish to, without having to contend with the friend’s sorrowful look. We’d originally thought of just ordering mixed hot and sour soup (₹235), but then we decided we could do with some mixed Chinese chop suey (₹415), too. And since a healthy meal calls for greens, I asked for a plate of stir-fried vegetables (₹395).

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard is pleased with his side's strong start to the Premier League season but said they have a long way to go to match the standards set by Manchester City and Liverpool in previous campaigns.


  Chelsea went top of the league briefly on Saturday with 2-0 victory at Newcastle United before dropping back to third after Tottenham Hotspur's win over Manchester City and Liverpool's win over Leicester City.


  "After eight or nine games, it would be easy to get excited about being in a lofty position but I'm not going to smile too much," Lampard told Chelsea's website.


  "We're in a decent position but doing that consistently over a big period is the next step for us now.


   


   


  "The first port of call this year was to close the gap on Man City and Liverpool, who have set different levels of consistency through a season," Lampard added.


  "We are improving but we cannot get carried away. We have to try to reach those levels but I'm happy with where we're at right now."


  Chelsea face Rennes in the Champions League on Tuesday with German playmaker Kai Havertz set to return after completing his period of isolation following a positive Covid-19 test earlier this month.


  "Kai is a naturally fit boy so I hope to have him travelling with us to Rennes and maybe he'll get some minutes," Lampard said.

This idea is at the heart of the concept of Shared Value, which has been defined as “a framework for creating economic value while simultaneously addressing societal needs and challenges,” and as the “practice of profit in a way that creates value for society.” Shared Value doesn’t suggest that businesses should act as philanthropies or charities, giving handouts to those who exhibit need. It goes beyond the idea of corporate social responsibility, which is often based on volunteerism and one-off donations. Perhaps most important, Shared Value recognizes that companies can only stay in business if they are making money. As consultants FSG described it, the value companies and the community are sharing is “worth,” that is, economic value on a financial sheet and societal value in the form of progress on social issues.

In addition to poking Facebook’s previous acquisition, investigators are also eyeing the way in which it managed its vast troves of user data, as well as the policies it has in place that govern when and how third-party app developers and other companies can access it. It’s not hard to read between the lines. Expect an argument from investigators contending that Facebook weaponized its most valuable asset – data – as a way to stamp out emerging rivals. Facebook, for its part, has lobbied hard against these claims. Mark Zuckerberg has stressed to lawmakers that his company’s purchase of Instagram, WhatsApp and other startups did not threaten competition, but rather allowed those services to flourish worldwide.

  Warner, who has had his share of aggressive on-field showdowns, said he would prefer to look the other way if Indians try to get chatty with him.


  “I’ll always draw from that mate. To try and get engaged, that’s the way they like to play as well,” he said.


  “We’re learning over time, trying not to engage in that. Probably try and reversing the effect by trying and ignoring it, trying to take it on board and using it against them by using your bat,” he added.


  “It’s probably something I’ve learnt over time. And you don’t know the effect it can have on your teammates as well. You’ve got to be a bit more humble in that respect.”


  Warner said at 34, he has become a calculated risk-taker and is focussed on maintaining a strong strike rate.


  “For myself, it’s about getting off to a good start and taking calculated risks in that middle-overs period if we’re talking about 50-over games,” he said.


  “For me, it’s about making sure that I am batting as much as I can and at a good strike-rate as well. I think last year was probably the most disciplined I’ve batted in Test match cricket as well.


  “I really took pride in the last 12-24 months, to apply that discipline and you keep learning as you get older...You’ve got to be on top of your game to be able to adapt to that.


  A lot of this discipline has come fatherhood, said Warner, crediting his children for the gradually-acquired patience.


  ”...not get too aggressive or angry when the kids aren’t listening. For me, I am getting tested on and off the field. So, it’s about being calm and relaxed and trying to sum up the situation you’re playing in,” he said.


  “And making sure, you’re taking that right risk at the right time. I think last 12-24 months, I’ve been doing that quite well,” he added.


  “Make sure you’re not bringing people down with your emotions and keep trying to find ways to get better as a player and as a team player.”


  Talking about the Indian team, which will not feature in-form opener Rohit Sharma at least in the ODIs and T20Is, Warner said it would a big hole to fill but Virat Kohli’s men do have the wherewithal to manage.


  ”...obviously he is a big piece of their team, that they are going to be missing, but they have got great in-form guys KL Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan and Mayank (Agarwal), these guys played in the IPL, so you have got guys who are in good touch,” he said.


  Indian captain Virat Kohli will be flying back to India for the birth of his first child after the first Test, starting December 17 in Adelaide, and Warner lauded the decision.


  The batting main-stay also had words of praise for India’s Test vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane and said he brings a calm and measured approach.


  Asked how different the Test contest would be with Rahane expected to lead after Virat leaves, Warner said, “He’s calm and very measured in his approach. He’s got a very good cricket brain.


  ”...it’s like chalk and cheese with them two (Kolhi and Rahane) and as a player to try and engage him on the field, as we’re talking about engaging, and getting into that contest as players, it’s obviously lots to think about how to do that especially with Ajinkya as captain.


  “The great thing from India’s perspective is that you’ve got three if not four very good players who could captain the team at any time. With him, he’ll bring a calm and measured approach with his nature.”


  Warner was seen playing aggressively at the back end of the IPL and he stressed that he won’t be changing his game.


  “Yeah definitely. What do you want to see? 100 of 10 overs or something? (laughs). In the one-day stuff, I’ll still come out and play the way I normally do. There’s probably going to be no change to that,” he said.


  “Here in Australia, it’s a bit different, in 50-over cricket, you can still play the normal way you do and I think I showed that last year, the way I played against Pakistan and Sri Lanka.


  “I played pretty much the same way as I did during the backend of that IPL. I won’t be changing my game and will go out and tackle it the way I always do,” added Warner, who has 5,303 ODI runs.


  The series will be aired on Sony Ten 1, Sony Ten 3 and Sony Six channels from November 27, 8 a.m. onwards.

The number of confirmed COVID-19-positive cases has remained low since September even in light of the reopening of markets and businesses. That said, the enforcement of wearing masks in schools, shops and other public places is still in effect even though an increased number of people are seen without wearing masks. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on the economy at large. Several sectors have been adversely affected, specifically tourism and hospitality, with some organisations scaling down their operations and others having either reduced or cut the salaries and benefits of their staff. Despite this and to limit its impact on the economy, the Reserve Bank of Malawi has recently reduced the benchmark policy rate to 12.0 percent [1] in order to support economic recovery. The Central Bank has done this by supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), commercial banks and microfinance institutions via the provision of structured SME loans and provided a moratorium on their debt service until the end of 2020. Fees on mobile money transactions were temporarily waived to encourage cashless transactions.

“Outside of a couple of songs, these are songs that feel rare or at least rare to other people. Young Green Day fans have never heard a song like ‘Kids In America’. I don’t know how that’s possible, but they’re able to get turned on to different things. Same with a song like ‘Corpus Christi’ too. That’s one of my favourite songs of all time. I also noticed that I ended up covering a lot of women. Maybe it’s just because my voice is womanly or feminine – I’m not really sure! Maybe it’s just about taking those songs and putting a male take on it. There are songs by Kim Wilde and The Bangles, plus Green Day covered ‘Dreaming’ by Blondie, but that’s not going to come out on this album. There’s no rhyme or reason to any of it really."

Turnbull said reigning royalty will continue their reign for another year.


  This year’s festival scheduled begins on Dec. 11 with a Virtual Tree Lighting in Limpricht Park, hosted by the Crucian Cultural Group. The organization’s president, Vivian Fludd, said they will be broadcasting the tree lighting on as many platforms as possible to give everyone an opportunity to enjoy it.


  “This will be the biggest of the events we are having for the season and our theme ‘A Crucian Chandelier of Lights,’ will hopefully raise some spirits in the community because this has been a tough year,” she said.


  Because of coronavirus considerations, Fludd said the park may not be open to the public, so there will be no intricate decorations this year. “It’s just going to be the lights. People don’t have to come into the park to see the lights. They can see from outside or across the street,” she said. “But it is also really symbolic. In a year like we’ve had, we see the lights as a symbol of hope and a reminder that we are resilient and there is light at the end of every tunnel.”


  Crucian Cultural Group will also present its mobile lantern parade, a historical dialogue and cultural food demonstrations. Among other highlights of the festival, Turbull said everyone should get ready for Drive for Drive, Culinary Showcase, Capri Curves Fitness and the Jou-virtual virtual j’ouvert.


  “We want people to feel like they are really coming down the road. The energy for this virtual j’ouvert is going to be insane,” he said. Shamari Haynes, assistant director for the Division of Festival on St. Croix, said while some residents and people who planned to visit St. Croix for this year’s festival are disappointed, they are all also very understanding of the reasons the festival has to be virtual.


  “This is a life of new normalcy for all of us, things are changing almost daily. People want to have a good time, but they also realized the risks associated with mass gatherings,” he said. “The energy on the feedback has been great and we have received a tremendous amount of support from the community.” Turnbull said the Festivals Division is focused on perfecting on the virtual product and making a name for the territory.


  “We have three festivals, which is a very advantageous position for us to be in versus other locations,” he said. “We’ve gotten it right each time and artists and potential visitors are paying attention. We’ve expanded our reach so that people can chose to come in December, April or July and enjoy our culture and we will promise a great time every time.”

In an announcement, Total said that the Luiperd well was drilled to a total depth of about 3,400 meters and encountered 73 meters of net gas condensate pay, making it even larger than the main reservoir at Brulpadda. Total and its partners have decided to commercialize the Luiperd gas rather than drill another exploration well in the program.

  Arizona, as an African immigrant living in diaspora, I never thought I would experience a time when Nigerian politics, which has been widely criticized by our American leader, President Trump, is now looking like child’s play. In fact, I recall the second day after President Trump had been sworn into office, I was shocked when Nigeria was listed amongst the terrorist countries!


  I watched in horror as Nigeria scrolled across my TV screen. I remember thinking to myself, she may be a lot of things but a terrorist country — she is not.

John-Baptiste began looking for a location where she could sell her teas and saw a listing for 81C, a new pop-up event space created by local entrepreneur Zack Zook. Located on Strand Gade near Market Square, the two-story building was originally built in 1810 as a rum warehouse and residence and is now completely renovated and restored. Zook’s aim is to create a platform for creative event rental, artist/entrepreneur networking and giving young entrepreneurs such as John-Baptiste a space to test new products or hold supplemental events to complement their online business.


  A deal was struck, and the first Bubbles by Lani pop-up networking event will be hosted Sunday from 1 a.m. to 8 p.m.


  “It’s a good way to test the product and make sure it’s something people want before I pay $5,000 a month in rent for something people don’t really like,” said John Baptist. “Meanwhile, people can have it, and if I never end up having a store, at least I can show something new to my people, brought to them by somebody who grew up here. If I can’t go all the way with it, that’s fine with me. It’s more important for me to do it and say that I’ve done it than to hold my breath and not start until I make sure from start to end that this is going to work, because I cannot control the future. So, today, if I can stand up at a counter and sell some people bubble tea, then I’m going to, and if tomorrow, some crazy murder hornet comes into my house and eats up all my tea leaves, then I’ve still sold bubble tea and I can check it off my list.”


  At the event, John-Baptiste will introduce her bubble tea for $6.50 for a 16-ounce drink. A limited menu will include her personal favorite, blueberry and peach with strawberry boba, as well as a brown sugar and milk tea with tapioca boba, a classic milk tea and a strawberry, passion fruit and mango mixture.


  “I’m just excited to have people try it. If this is the only time that they get to try bubble tea, I’m the one that brought it to them and that’s kind of cool,” she said. “Plus, I can show other local girls that they should just do something, just go for it. You don’t have to have a big place, just have an idea and roll with it. My whole life, I just do things. They don’t always go all the way, but at least I can say I had the experience and if I don’t try, then what do I have? You just take it one step at a time and figure it out. Just keep on making moves and you’ll end up somewhere. Maybe it won’t be where you expected, but it’s going to be somewhere different than where you started, and I think that in itself is an accomplishment.”

Once the PC had the right bootloader, a 64k FreeDOS bootable disk image was recorded on vinyl. [Jozef] provides infuriatingly little detail about the process other than to mention that the audio was sent directly to the vinyl lathe; we'd have loved to learn more about that. Nonetheless, the resulting 10″ record, played back at 45 RPM with some equalization tweaks to adapt for the RIAA equalization curve of the preamp, boots the PC into FreeDOS just fine, probably in no more time than it would have taken to boot from floppy.
