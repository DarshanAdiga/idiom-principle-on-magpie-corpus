 "The red card was a joke, it was not intentional, for sure it was not violent,” Ancelotti said on _Sky Sports_.
 “Maybe it was a yellow. Maybe all this talk all week against [Jordan] Pickford, against Richarlison, affected the decision and if so it's not right, it's not fair. We will appeal, for sure.

The Jets dropped to 0-7 for the first time since the 1996 team opened 0-8 en route to a 1-15 season.
 New York coach Adam Gase said the team was looking for anything that might help it get a victory. So he handed off playcalling duties on offense to coordinator Dowell Loggains — and it seemed to give the Jets an early spark.
 Darnold, making his first start since missing two games with a sprained AC joint in his right shoulder, marched New York down the field before the drive stalled in the red zone. Sergio Castillo booted a 29-yard field goal — his first NFL kick in place of the injured Sam Ficken — to give the Jets a 3-0 lead.
 The Jets’ second drive also stalled in the red zone, with La’Mical Perine getting stuffed for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-1 from the Bills 18.
 New York's defense came up with a big play on Buffalo's second possession. On third-and-goal from the 14, Tarell Basham sacked Allen and caused a fumble that John Franklin-Myers recovered. The Jets capitalized, with Perine reaching for the pylon on a 5-yard touchdown run that put New York up 10-0 midway through the second quarter — its largest lead of the season.
 The drive was helped by pass interference calls on Tre'Davious White and Hyde.

 Authorities requested military assistance after reports that several stowaways onboard the Liberian-registered Nave Andromeda had turned violent. Initial reports suggested the ship had been hijacked.
 A 3-mile (5 kilometer) exclusion zone was set up around the vessel, which is anchored near the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have again agreed to respect a "humanitarian ceasefire" in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, effective Monday, the US State Department announced.
 Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun met Saturday with the two countries' foreign ministers and the co-chairs of the Minsk Group, the department said in a joint statement on Sunday.
 Washington, along with France and Russia, is part of the Minsk Group, which was formed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to be the main mediator in the conflict.
 The statement said the ceasefire would take effect at 8:00 am local time (04H00 GMT) on Monday after an earlier ceasefire brought a brief lull Saturday before each side accused the other of violating it.
 The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, recognized internationally as part of Azerbaijan but controlled by Armenian separatists, began September 27.
 Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of having targeted the civilian population since the beginning of hostilities in the mountainous region.
 This is not the first time they have committed themselves to a truce, but it has not held so far.
 The latest agreement came after "intensive negotiation" between Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
 Pompeo had met separately Friday with Mnatsakanyan and Bayramov, urging them to "end the violence and protect civilians."
 The State Department said the Minsk co-chairs and the foreign ministers "agreed to meet again in Geneva on October 29" to seek "all steps necessary to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict".
