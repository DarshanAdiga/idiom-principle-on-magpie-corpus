Drown said they reduced their allowed capacity by half (from 196 to 98), which is disappointing for the holiday.
 “St. Patrick’s Day is normally our busiest time but people aren’t taking any chances,” Drown said. “I’m sure things will keep changing but we’re flexible. Everyone has been calm. We just want to make sure everyone is safe. We don’t think this is anyone overreacting.”
 Popular restaurants like Buffalo Wild Wings in Yuba City will not allow more than 50 people at a time to dine in, per the CDC’s recommendation, and even local Starbucks have closed their lobbies to prohibit dining in and encourage social distancing.
 “We’ve seen a significant drop in business since Friday,” said Colette Davies, the general manager at Brick Coffee House Cafe, a popular meet-up place for breakfast and lunch in Marysville. “Our revenue has already been cut in half. We’ve had to reduce staffing until further notice.”
 During the normal rush hour on Tuesday, there were no customers waiting in line at the Brick. Davies said the shop has made some changes like closing at 3 p.m. instead of 5 p.m. She also said that if social distancing is mandated, they will practice seating guests away from each other or start pick- up/curbside orders.
 Rebecca Chiles, a bartender at Big John’s Bar and Grill in Yuba City, said she was concerned when she first got word of the governor’s recommendation to close bars.
 “I’m a full-time student at Yuba College, I have kids and this is my only source of income,” Chiles said. “Classes were already being moved so I was worried about that, but when I heard about bar shutdowns, I got really nervous. Luckily Big John’s isn’t just a bar, it’s also a restaurant so we don’t have to close and I’ll still be able to work.”

So yeah, high praise.
 The only real downside to the Viper Mini is the sensor. Whether to cut down on price or on weight, I don’t know, but Razer has opted not to use its top-tier PMW 3360 spinoff, the 3389 sensor (also known as the Razer 5G Optical).
 Instead, the Viper Mini uses a PMW 3359—which, as far as I can tell, was invented specifically for this mouse. Numbers aren’t everything, but they do indicate this is a budget sensor. Where Razer’s 3389/5G Optical sensor hits 16,000 DPI, the 3359 tops out at 8,500. Maximum speed has also taken a hit, with the Viper Mini capped at 300 inches-per-second compared to the 3389’s 450.
 Does it matter? Probably not. Having tested the Viper Mini and the 3359 both with some basic benchmarks and in-game, it seems every bit as capable as the 3360/3389 (up to the DPI cap at least). That’s what I expected, really. Nowadays I’d be surprised if _any_ mouse sensor gave people problems.
 IDG / Hayden Dingman
 Still, I find it weird Razer opted for a budget sensor. I’ve seen a lot of people asking for a Viper Mini the past few months, and presumably they wanted a full-blooded Viper Mini with the original 3389 sensor. The same mouse as the Viper, only smaller. Compromising the Viper Mini’s performance—even if only on paper—seems like a strange choice to make along the way.
 Part of me wonders if it’s intended (at least in part) for kids. Small, lightweight, cheap—the Viper Mini could be an up-and-comer’s first gaming mouse. Maybe I’m reading too much in to a few unrelated choices, but...well, I’m curious.
 ## Bottom line
 I don’t mean to sound dismissive of the Viper Mini. It’s not _only_ for kids. That just seems like a side-benefit, accidental or not.
 As I said, there aren’t many options for people with smaller hands, and the Viper Mini seems like a solid newcomer. I wish Razer had used its tried-and- true sensor instead of a cheap alternative, but aside from that, it’s a sturdy mouse that should survive a lot of wear and tear, and at $40 it’s about as budget-friendly as you can get for a name-brand gaming mouse.

Generally, most farms see a 10% increase in organic matter every year, which eventually adds up in economic benefits. Two weeks ago, the Land Stewardship Project held a soil health event with Jonathan Lundgren, who holds a PhD in entomology and was a top scientist with the USDA. His studies showed that net profit is directly correlated with organic matter in the ground.
 Additionally, McCormick said they also want to try no-till, which has worked for other farmers in the area. That could take a bit longer to see the benefits, because Houston County’s clay soil doesn’t respond well to no-till, he explained.
 “At the end of the day it’s about making a living out of it,” McCormick added.
 The 30 beef cows living on the farm have a role to play too. Eventually they’ll be moved out to the rye and allowed to graze. When they’re ready to calve, the rye will provide a dry place for new calves.
 Though McCormick learned about some of the new practices while in college, he’s also learned a lot from Spring Grove farmer Myron Sylling and neighbors Bob and Greta Mierau.
 “It’s nice to have people you can bounce questions off of,” he said. “You learn as you go. You might make some mistakes but it’s worth the lesson. The benefits outweigh the cost.”
 And though the soil practices aren’t necessarily new, more and more farmers are starting to use the methods again.
 “With the lower commodity prices now, you have to find ways to utilize your land while still taking care of it and this is a good way to do it,” McCormick said.
 He is also planning to do custom cover crop seeding for local farmers this fall.
 As for the future, McCormick recently bought his own acreage of land just down the road and is excited to improve the soil health. Eventually, he and his dad would like to have every acre planted with a cover crop and no-till.
 Their farm was originally established in 1949 by McCormick’s grandfather, Jim, and his brothers.

Gonzaga (31-2) finished second after beating Saint Mary’s in the West Coast Conference finals, one of a handful of league tournaments that were completed. But the Bulldogs will be left to wonder whether another dominant team from coach Mark Few would have finally delivered the school a national championship.
 Dayton (29-2) was third behind behind breakout stars Jalen Crutcher and Obi Toppin. That matched the 1955-56 team led by Bill Uhl and Jim Paxson for the best finish in program history.
 “The voters who deemed us worthy to be one of the top five teams in the country and finish in the poll in the top three, we appreciate that,” Flyers coach Anthony Grant said. “Having that recognition hopefully is something — another thing that you can look back on and will be in the history books, that this team was able to accomplish a top-five ranking.”
 Florida State (26-5) was fourth in the final poll, easily the best finish ever for the Seminoles, while Baylor (26-4) rounded out the top five after spending a longer stretch at No. 1 than any other team during a topsy-turvy season.
 “I think ‘historical’ always sums up a season when you’re able to set so many records and accomplish so many things,” said Bears coach Scott Drew, whose team was in the running for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament after finishing second to Kansas in the Big 12 race. “This group really got along well. It is a group that really loved one another, spent time with one another, and they were always positive, and that led us to having a historical year.”
 REST OF THE POLL
 No. 11 Duke finished outside the top 10 for only the second time since 2007, while Maryland, Oregon, Louisville and Seton Hall came next.
 The rest of the Top 25 included reigning national champion Virginia at No. 16, followed by Wisconsin, BYU, Ohio State and Auburn. The final five in the poll were Illinois, Houston, Butler, West Virginia and Iowa.

Overseen creatively by Liz Tigelaar ("Life Unexpected"), "Little Fires Everywhere" is one of those rare multi-generational dramas where the arcs involving the kids are every bit as good as the adults, as the conflicts gradually build. Indeed, while Witherspoon and Washington understandably have some of the showiest moments (both are producers on the project), the series has the feel of a true ensemble piece in all the best ways.
 Set in the late 1990s, the show also offers a knowing glimpse at a time when casual racism and classism were bandied about a bit more overtly, but really rear their ugly heads in moments of tension or crisis. In this case, that involves a third-party dispute over an adopted baby that draws both Elena and Mia into the fray.
 Various networks sought the project's rights before Hulu landed them, and while such feeding-frenzy scenarios don't always pan out for the winning bidder, in this case, the appeal of "Little Fires Everywhere" is more than just smoke and mirrors.
  _"Little Fires Everywhere" premieres March 18 on Hulu._

Third District Councilwoman Suzie Price, for her part, said she had a difficult time supporting a ban on evictions if, say, it would also prevent a landlord from kicking out a tenant who had committed domestic violence on the property.
 “If they are involved in something other than the nonpayment of rent because of COVID-19,” she said, “I don’t believe the moratorium should apply to that.”
 That reasoning ultimately won out, although other council members said they thought more work would need to be done to protect a broader scope of renters.
 Richardson, for his part, said he believed the city should act to prevent landlords from kicking out tenants to remodel a unit for the time being.
 “How do you evict a whole building for a substantial remodel in this moment?” he asked.
 Still, he said, he supported the narrower scope for now.
 “It is not perfect. We’re going to have to continue to meet and work these things out,” he said. “But tonight, we’re giving a lot of calm to people who are struggling and have a lot of anxiety.”
 Mayor Robert Garcia, meanwhile, said the council’s action was important.
 “I think, as we are all aware, we are at the beginning of what is going to be a long and very difficult economic recovery,” he said, “and the city’s actions tonight, I think, are absolutely an important part of that.”
 But he also said more work would be necessary. In addition to calling on the state and federal governments to provide direct aid to all residents to help them survive the crisis, he said the current pandemic will likely impact the city for months and years to come.
 “We are entering, once we get past the immediate health crisis which is in front of us right now, and will continue, I believe, for probably weeks and months ahead,” he said, “absolutely the next focus for this body and for the city is going to be economic recovery.
 “We’re going to have to make very difficult decisions,” Garcia added, “as it relates to our finances and our budgets in the weeks, months and probably years ahead.”

The items that were given the okay included a 30-day ban on commercial and residential evictions that happen as a result of non-payment.
 That item will have to come back to the council in the form of an ordinance to be implemented, which will likely happen next week.
 On top of the ban, so property owners don’t have to worry about what the loss of income means for them, the council also directed city staff to look into nonprofits and other potential funding sources that may pay rent on behalf of tenants who have lost income as a result of the coronavirus.
 Other ideas the council directed city staff to explore included partnering with banks and lenders to prohibit foreclosures; finding ways to support workers who have been impacted but are not covered by unemployment benefits; and offering relief for laid off or furloughed workers in a slew of impacted industries, including tourism, hospitality, trade and service work.
 Regarding the moratorium on evictions, Ninth District Councilman Rex Richardson said the policy would fall in line with other moves the city government has made to ensure people are able to stay isolated at home.
 “The idea is to limit movement,” he said. “You can’t shelter in place if you don’t have shelter.”
 COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms associated with the respiratory disease, which appear two-to-14 days after exposure, include fever, a cough and shortness of breath. While most people — including healthy young adults — will experience mild symptoms, the disease can be severe and possibly fatal for at-risk groups, such as the elderly and those with other health problems.
 Bars, restaurants and large events have been targeted for closure or cancellation because the virus travels easily among people in close proximity; experts recommend maintaining at least 6 feet of distance between people to prevent it from spreading.
 Allowing landlords to force people to find new housing in the middle of the pandemic, Richardson said, would run counter to the other actions the city has taken.
 Council members debated over the details of the policy, like whether evictions unrelated to renters’ ability to pay due to the coronavirus pandemic should be included. The original motion would have applied to all evictions, regardless of the reasoning.

That's not to say, however, that there aren't multiple barrels from the same distillation used for a single barrel proof expression. (That is to say, "barrel proof" doesn't mean "just one barrel.") The point is more that these are the bourbons that taste good from the barrel that they can go straight to the consumer at a higher ABV and still be very palatable.

"Jeder Spieler hat einen Trainingsplan bekommen. Heute mussten wir 40 Minuten Laufen und Stabilitätsübungen machen. Gelaufen bin ich am Main, die Übungen habe ich daheim gemacht. Den Rest des Tages gehe ich viel spazieren und koche viel. Zwischen den Spielern gibt es schon noch Kontakt, unter anderem in einer WhatsApp-Gruppe. Aber man kommt auch mal eine Woche ohne die Teamkollegen aus."

Pinot noir is far and away my favourite. It's funny, because Pinot noir can be quite difficult to grow and hard to work with, so you would think it would be my least favourite. For me, making Pinot noir is truly a labour a love. All of our Pinot is produced exclusively with grapes grown by my parents on the farm where I grew up. There is something really special about this place. The vineyard sits at an elevation of 620 metres and when it comes to growing Pinot, elevation is key.

The easiest fix on the roster to fill the void at left guard is Matt Feiler. He's been the team's starting right tackle for the last season and 10 games but is a natural guard. Just looking at veteran depth on the team, there is much more at tackle than guard so the Steelers might find it easier to slide Feiler inside and let Zach Banner and Chuks Okorafor duke it out for the starting right tackle spot.

Renters and business owners in Long Beach will have some economic relief in the midst of the new coronavirus pandemic, thanks to action the City Council took Tuesday, March 17.
 The panel voted unanimously to move ahead with a slate of regulations to help residents weather the storm unfolding as nightclubs, bars, theaters, bowling alleys, arcades and gyms have been ordered to close in accordance with state and county guidance to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.
 Bars and restaurants have already reported laying off workers; earlier Tuesday, Hyatt announced it would shut down its two Long Beach hotels until at least May 11.

The WIAA decided to go ahead with the sectional games, but limited the number of fans who could be in attendance.
 “This has happened so fast that you just try to go with the flow and try to make it work for the kids,” DeForest athletic director Mike McHugh said. “We just want the kids to have the experience they have earned. It was a test to see how much they wanted it as a team because they were not going to get to play in front of their classmates. This was all about them.”
 While some of the sectional semifinal games were played with no crowd, players from DeForest and Stoughton were allowed to purchase four tickets each for their families.
 “This gym would be packed under normal circumstances and I know the boys were looking forward to that experience,” said Jenny Elvekrog, whose son, Alex, is a senior for the Norskies. “They have been robbed of it. I think it was a good call to play the game, but it is sad at the same time.
 “It has been really weird,” she added. “We don’t know if there will be a state tournament even if we get there. It breaks your heart because of all the hard work they have put in over the years.”

Lorenzo Carter is a promising option at that spot, but his consistency is an issue. He only recorded 4.5 sacks last year and experienced spurts of two, two, and three games in which he didn't record one at all. It was the same story in his rookie year. During that season, Carter racked up four sacks but went through spurts of two, two, three, and four games without one.

"Her vomit can be yellow and clear but sometimes there is blood in her vomit where she ruptures the blood vessels if she has been strained," Philipa said.
 "That’s why we can’t wait a year for the NHS to do the operation, it’s not fair on her."
 Because of an undiagnosed genetic condition, Bella is also very small and it took her a little bit longer to walk and talk because of the developmental delay.
 But despite everything, Bella, who now has a nine-month-old brother, Teddy, is always smiling.
 "Bearing in mind she has only been talking a year, she is a massive character, Philipa continued.
 "She’s so happy, she’s a typical three and a half year old, trying to get her own way and considering she has a few issues, she is a very happy child.
 "Everyone knows her where we live in Great Baddow.
 "She didn't walk or talk until she was two and a half but since then she has come on so far.
 "She grows but really slowly, her brother is nine months old and wearing nine to twelve month old clothes and I can put them on her."
 With everything up in the air with coronavirus, Bella's parents are concerned that the operation, scheduled for April 2 at the No Tube Clinic in Austria, could be jeopardised.
 They have made the decision to pull Bella out of preschool to make sure she stays healthy enough to go.
 It is essential that Bella can get to the clinic before she turns five, the maximum age at which the clinic can accept children.
 There is a 90 percent success rate for weaning tube-dependent children off the tube - which Philipa and Matthew hope will change their daughter's life.
 "For her sake, we want her to eat," Philippa says.
 "It would mean everything to us just to get her to eat and get that tube off her.
 "It restricts her because she can't run around because of how heavy it is. We have to change her tube too and now she is more aware of what is happening.
 "It's heartbreaking for us to have to pin her down and change the tube. She says 'no mummy, no milk' because she knows as soon as it is in her she is going to vomit."
 Even daily meal times have become difficult, as Bella can’t sit and eat a meal with her mum, dad and brother.
 Thankfully at pre-school, the staff all make sure that Bella is never left out and joins in at snack time, even if she doesn’t eat.

Organizers say the festival, due to take place June 24-28, would be postponed until 2021.
 Glastonbury organizers Michael Eavis and Emily Eavis said there would “inevitably be severe financial implications” for staff, suppliers, charities supported by Glastonbury and more. But they said there was no choice but to call off the festival in light of government advice for people to avoid contact with others.
 Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, the Pet Shop Boys and Paul McCartney were among the acts announced for the 50th anniversary edition of the music extravaganza.
 The festival takes over Worthy Farm in southwest England every June. The 135,000 tickets for this year’s event sold within an hour of going on sale.

“The Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps above and beyond what the House has passed to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm,” McConnell said.
 Bigger than the 2008 bank bailout or the 2009 recovery act, the White House proposal aims to provide a massive tax cut for wage-earners, $50 billion for the airline industry and relief for small businesses.
 Two people familiar with the request described it to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.
 “There’s great spirit” among lawmakers, President Donald Trump said at the White House briefing Tuesday as he outlined several elements of the rescue plan. “I can say that for Republicans and Democrats.”
 But it’s an enormous political and economic undertaking as a slow-moving Congress tries to rise to the occasion of these fast times.
 The debate is sure to revive the sharp divisions over the costly bank bailout and economic recovery of the Obama and Bush era. Particularly striking is McConnell’s urgency after having adjourned the Senate over the weekend while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi muscled through an aid package.
 Angry senators from both parties boarded planes returning to a changed Washington, as Trump declared a state of emergency, the virus spread and the economic free-fall worsened.
 The White House hopes the measure will pass quickly, possibly this week, an enormous political undertaking as the administration scrambled to contain the economic fallout of the severe disruptions to American life from the outbreak.
 White House officials offered senators a preliminary briefing late Monday at the Capitol, saying they want the plan approved by Congress as soon as possible, suggesting in a matter of days.
 “ASAP,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late Monday. “There’s an urgency.”
 The rush to inject cash and resources into the economy is an effort unlike any since the 2008 economic crisis, with political and economic interventions and eye-popping sums to try to protect Americans from the health and financial fallout.
 “We’ve got a lot of work to do from here,” Mnuchin told reporters late Monday.
 The new proposal is beyond the House ‘s estimated $100 billion aid package of sick pay, emergency food aid and free virus testing that was approved over the weekend and is pending before the Senate.
 Now Congress will be rushing to pass two — a massive, sweeping response to the virus outbreak that is rewriting America’s way of life.
 Muscling the aid will test Congress and the White House at a pivotal moment in the crisis and in an election year when the two parties have vastly different outlooks on the best way to prop up the economy and help Americans.
 Senate Democrats have proposed their own $750 billion package — boosting hospital capacity and unemployment checks for the suddenly jobless — with deep negotiations to come.
