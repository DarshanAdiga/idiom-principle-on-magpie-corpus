New Delhi [India], Apr 21 (ANI): The magnitude and speed of collapse in economic activity that India has seen over the last few weeks due to COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented and there is tremendous uncertainty about what the future holds for businesses and enterprises, according to a recent survey by FICCI and Dhruva Advisors.   Almost 72 per cent of the respondents to the survey reported that COVID-19 is having a 'high to very high' level of impact on their business. Further, a substantial majority of the respondents do not foresee a positive demand outlook for their business in this fiscal with 70 per cent of the surveyed firms expecting degrowth in sales in the fiscal year 2020-21.   A vast majority also foresee a reduction in their business cashflows and company's order book. The survey clearly highlights that unless a substantive economic package is announced by the government immediately, there could be a permanent impairment of a large section of industry, which may lose the opportunity to come back to life again.   "Jobs are also at risk over the coming months as nearly three-fourth of the surveyed firms said that they may look at some reduction in manpower in their respective companies." These findings came up in a joint nationwide survey of businesses conducted by FICCI and Dhruva Advisors over the last week.   The survey was conducted to find how enterprises are getting impacted in terms of their business operations, what steps are being planned to maintain business continuity, what is their outlook for business in the FY21 and what are their expectations from the government in this hour of crisis.   The survey saw participation from almost 380 companies from across sectors and has thrown up important results and insights that should be useful for the policymakers as they plan for the next steps of their integrated approach to support the Indian industry.   "The COVID-19 pandemic is causing deep economic harm and could reverse the gains made in the industrial economy over many decades," said FICCI President Sangita Reddy.   "There is a need to render immediate and sizable support to industry to protect people, jobs and enterprises. Industry members are reeling under severe financial stress and are in urgent need of ample liquidity to ensure business continuity," she said.   "We are hopeful that the government will introduce a series of measures in quick succession to support demand and ensure business continuity. This will be a confidence booster and we hope sentiment will improve following the economic package," said Reddy.   Dinesh Kanabar, Chief Executive Officer of Dhruva Advisors, said the broad- based survey shows the deep impact that COVID-19 is likely to leave on the Indian economy in the short to medium term. Clearly, the plans prepared by businesses on fund-raising, investments and expansion are being pushed back.   "Businesses will focus on cost optimisation and supply chain management. There is a significant expectation from the Government for a financial stimulus and providing liquidity, including by way of tax refunds and cheaper credit, so that the economy returns to normalcy faster," he said.   The other notable findings the survey has thrown up include the impact COVID-19 has had on companies' expansion plans. Results show that in respect of approved expansion plans, 61 per cent expect to defer such expansions for a period up to 6 or 12 months while 33 per cent expect to defer approved expansion plans for more than 12 months.   Further, while 60 per cent of the surveyed firms have deferred their fund- raising plans for the next 6 to 12 months, nearly 25 per cent of the firms have shelved the same.   With domestic demand plummeting to record low levels, companies were hoping that exports may provide an outlet for them to energise growth. While 43 per cent of the surveyed firms reported that they do not foresee an impact on exports, nearly 34 per cent said that exports will take a hit by more than 10 per cent. (ANI)

Democrats have entered the hand-wringing phase of the election season, fretting about Joe Biden and poised to leap from their windows. I’ve been around this game long enough to tell you that this happens every time with every nominee. Everyone needs to chill. We’re all stuck at home anyway, so there’s no reason not to.
 Assuming that the November balloting takes place (it’s mandated in the Constitution, if that’s any solace), I foresee six reasons why Uncle Joe is likely to oust the worst excuse for a human being to ever fail upward:
 This election is a referendum on Trump. His predictably disastrous botching of the pandemic has made it so, and the verdict is already in. By the time this pandemic wanes, Trump, by dint of his serial incompetence, will have presided over the highest civilian American death toll in history (exceeding the Civil War’s 50,000). Try running for re-election on that record. And did I mention that he can no longer claim credit for a robust economy?

While that technical issue made for some splashy headlines, the broader oil market largely shrugged it off since producers are slashing supply, which will hopefully alleviate some of the storage issues in the coming months. However, that doesn't mean the June WTI contracts won't also go negative as they near expiration a month from now. Nor does it imply that oil stocks are out of the woods since crude prices in the $20s and $30s are still well below the level most producers need to survive. Because of those factors, the worst likely isn't over for the oil market.

Sonos has been making speakers for years now, but it's always been up to their owners to find audio to play on them. That hasn't exactly been a problem -- Sonos supports more than a hundred streaming services right now, and you could always play music from your personal library, as well. But today, the company is making its first foray into content with the launch of Sonos Radio. As the name implies, you'll be able to listen to a ton of terrestrial radio stations, but Sonos is also jumping into original content for the first time by curating its own genre-based stations and artist-created channels.
 The biggest source of content provided by Sonos Radio is 60,000-plus radio stations from around the world. Those stations are powered by a deal with providers TuneIn and IHeartRadio, and Sonos says it'll add more stations soon thanks to additional partnerships with Radio.com in the US and UK-based service Global. Sonos has offered TuneIn and IHeartRadio as streaming options for a while now, but it seems like this new service will make that experience more robust by aggregating stations from across the multiple services it has deals with.

The notorious, armor-clad, 19th-century Australian bushranger (slang for rural outlaw) Ned Kelly had previously been portrayed onscreen by Mick Jagger ("Ned Kelly," 1970) and by Heath Ledger ("Ned Kelly," 2003). Neither of those films was particularly memorable. Now, here comes British rising star George MacKay, the long-faced lead actor in "1917," to sparklingly bring the character to life in what turns out to be the best, by far, of the three attempts to tell the story.      But let's start with an important point: The beautiful and occasionally brutal film, from Australian director Justin Kurzel, bearing the much longer title "True History of the Kelly Gang," is not a "true history." Based on the Booker Prize-winning 2000 novel by Peter Carey, it, like the book, is a dramatic mix of fact and fiction that tells a fanciful version of the short life of Kelly from the age of 12 (terrifically played by Australian newcomer Orlando Schwerdt) to his final date with destiny 13 years later.      I won't attempt to speculate what's true here and what isn't, because since the film is making no claims to it, it doesn't make any difference. Besides, what's up on the screen is both riveting and entertaining.      Young Ned is first met growing up in a tin shack in a rural town north of Melbourne, the oldest of his siblings, with his mum, Ellen (Essie Davis), and dad, Red, all of them just eking by. Red (Ben Corbett) was a no-count loser who didn't provide for his family. Ellen, much to Red's consternation, earned money by selling her body to various male visitors, including the strapping but dastardly Sgt. O'Neil (Charlie Hunnam).      After Red is removed from the story, Ellen, hoping to give Ned something of a future, works out a deal with an old friend, the smiling, rough and tumble scoundrel Harry Power (Russell Crowe in an extended, scene-stealing cameo), who takes the lad out on the road to teach him the ways of the world, which include keeping a journal "to write your own history" and how to kill people.      Every performance in the film's first 40 minutes is right on the mark (Crowe even gets to sing!). But it's at that point, 10 years later in the story, that MacKay appears, bent backward, his head disconcertingly upside down, his adult Ned Kelly preparing for a bare-knuckle barroom fight, just before heading back home to his mum and grown siblings with hopes of becoming a farmer.      But that hope doesn't materialize, and we know that part is true, that Ned will end up embracing a life of crime, due to a variety of reasons, people and circumstances. It's then that the film starts introducing many more characters. Of note are George King (the amazing Marlon Williams), the much- younger man - and cad - who is about to marry Ned's unbalanced mum, and who is training Ned's brothers to become thieves; the charming but heinous Constable Fitzpatrick (Nicholas Hoult), whose behavior eventually goes unhinged; and Mary Hearn (Thomasin McKenzie), a sweet young woman working at a local brothel.      It would be simplest to say that this is an Australian art house Western, but it's chock full of cinematic and storytelling ingredients that pull it up above that category. It's about bad things happening to good people, and the revenge being sought because it of; it gets into people who are so driven by their goals, they start losing their marbles; and it offers explanations of why the bushrangers who became known as the Kelly Gang started donning dresses and armor before going into action.      One outstanding visual highlight of the film occurs near the end, when the law is closing in on the gang, and the screen erupts in an eerie and bizarrely and beautifully photographed nighttime gunfight. But even that long sequence can't hold a candle to the bigger-than-life, make that gigantic, performance by George MacKay. He's been at his craft for quite a while, and he's now, finally, a star in the making.      "True History of the Kelly Gang" will be available on most digital and cable platforms beginning April 24.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

Claims will be backdated to the date a person was first unemployed, Dickinson said.
 Statewide, the department has received 1,525,458 claims since March 15. They received nearly 200,000 new claims last week, according to data from the Office of Unemployment Compensation.
 The office has caught up with issuing pin numbers for benefits, which typically take seven to 10 days before they are received. Dickinson said if anyone has filed for unemployment and has not received a pin number, wait for two weeks before requesting a new pin because once a new pin is requested, the old pin becomes invalid. A new tab was created under the "Contact Us" portion of the unemployment website at www.uc.pa.gov for requesting a pin number.
 Officials repeated statements that they are working through a backlog of requests and working to shorten wait times for phone calls and address any errors with people who were eligible for unemployment and have not received it. Additional staffers were hired to address those issues.
 “I can assure you we are doing all we can to respond quickly to the needs of our citizens,” Oleksiak said. “We take this personally. We really want to do the right thing for our citizens.”

It’s been a month since the lockdown, and you are tearing your hair out. Just how are you going to cope with the remaining days of this isolation? Ask someone who’s been there — and done that: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, who was released late last month after almost eight months in detention.
 “Establish a routine & try to stick to it,” Abdullah tweeted after the Centre imposed a nationwide lockdown in a bid to stem the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. A set routine during his time in detention gave him a sense of purpose and stopped him from feeling “aimless or lost”, says Abdullah (who, incidentally, let his beard grow long and white during this period).
 The importance of adhering to a daily routine is seconded by health experts. Dr Naveen Jayaram, consultant psychiatrist at Bengaluru’s Sakra World Hospital, underscores the need for a daily timetable to fight tension. “When the lockdown was declared, it was sudden and we were not prepared. That gave rise to anxiety.”
 Additionally, staying indoors for long periods may lead to heightened worry, insecurity and restlessness, he points out. To top it, there is the fear of contracting the virus, which adds to the anxiety. “And then there is the whole uncertainty about the future,” he says. So it’s important to follow a structured routine, Dr Jayaram stresses.
 “The human body works best in daily rhythms or circadian rhythms. Therefore, waking up, eating and sleeping on time is very important.” This, he says, helps reduce the fear and stress common during a lockdown and keeps the adrenaline in check.
 He recommends a daily routine of 6-8 hours of sleep, timely meals and some form of physical exercise such as aerobics, yoga and bodyweight training. Supplement this with relaxation techniques such as _pranayam_ , meditation or other breathing exercises. “Dedicate some time to a hobby or some creative pursuit such as writing, painting or even gardening. Now that there is more time in hand, some hours must be set aside for the family,” he emphasises.
 Family activities may also include cooking or eating together, points out nutritionist and dietician Ashwini Jagnade. “As a principle, one should follow the practice of ‘mindful eating’,” Dr Jagnade says.
 To do that, one needs to “plan” menus in advance based on the available ingredients, more so now that supplies are limited. “This means not resorting to ready-to-eat noodles at the last moment,” she says. She recommends a light and early dinner, preferably by 7.30pm. Isolation may lead to a desire for junk food, but steer clear of that, she warns. Substitute cravings for sweet and salty foods with healthy snacks.
 “During this lockdown, we need to boost our immunity and our food intake must take care of that. A high-fibre, high-protein diet which includes antioxidants in the form of plenty of fruits and vegetables is the ideal meal plan to be followed. Carbohydrates must be eaten in moderate quantity,” she says.
 Abdullah’s advice about the need for regular physical exercise is also widely seen as an important coping mechanism. Chandan Reddy, a professional fitness trainer in Bengaluru, points out that staying fit boosts a person’s overall immunity, especially needed in the time of Covid-19. He advises a minimum of 15-20 minutes of daily exercise. “Basic bodyweight exercises that can be done at home such as planks, squats, lunges, push-ups are sufficient,” he says. For those unable to step outdoors for walks, even jogging on the spot helps.
 Apart from exercise, he advises at least 20 minutes of meditation first thing in the morning. That keeps you calm and productive through the day, he adds.
 The experts warn against the excessive use of social media. The information overload on Covid-19, the forwards on WhatsApp, on miracle cures and so on can cause unnecessary panic. On the other hand, they recommend the use of technology that helps people keep in touch with friends and relatives.
 Dr Jayaram cautions against “binge-watching” on streaming platforms. Do not watch for more than an hour or two, he says.
 The experts stress that children, who are at home now that schools are closed, need to follow a daily routine, too.
 Dr Jayaram says, “Children need constant encouragement and appreciation. When fixing hours for their studies, for watching TV, for playing, parents must also designate at least one hour every day for some creative activity with their kids or even storytelling.”
 The impact of the lockdown on children will depend on their parents — how calm and resilient they are, he says.
 “And that’s where the daily routine becomes significant, by instilling a sense of discipline and of calm,” he says.
 What’s equally important is that parents also need to be flexible with their children, because the lockdown is equally a period of uncertainty for the young ones, he adds.
 Since most people are working from home now, they should remember to relax the routine during the weekends.
 “The entire day then can be left unstructured,” he says.

Although Turkey, like the rest of the world, is facing its own problems with the coronavirus pandemic, that has not stopped it from mustering the effort to send vital medical aid to dozens of countries around the world.&nbsp;Some of the most hard-hit countries, including Italy and Spain, have been recipients of Turkish aid, as have countries ranging from the economically advanced like the United States and the United Kingdom to developing countries such as Iran and Somalia.However, while Turkey&rsquo;s relief efforts have been global in outlook, it is ironically European powers who have been the primary beneficiaries of Turkish magnanimity despite decades of hostility towards Ankara.Decades of poor treatmentIt is of little surprise that Turkey has been able to marshal its resources and impose effective measures in containing the coronavirus.&nbsp;For a start, Turkey has been host to millions of refugees from Syria alone for the better part of a decade and has managed to handle a crisis that would have brought many other economies, including in the West, to their knees.Turkey also has a long-standing history of disaster management, with cities such as Istanbul in the West and Van in the east suffering repeated earthquakes that have shattered homes and lives repeatedly.From an industrial point of view, Turkey also has a thriving technology and manufacturing sector, with Turkish defence and major appliances giants teaming up to produce the country&rsquo;s first domestically manufactured ventilators.&nbsp;Around 250 of these ventilators have now been completed, with the industrial conglomerate promising 5,000 units by the end of May at the cost of $6,500 per unit as opposed to almost $20,000 per unit for imported devices.With such a solid humanitarian and industrial foundation from which it can effectively combat the deadly disease, it is unsurprising that Turkey can take the initiative in providing aid abroad. It may be surprising that Turkey is so willing to do this at all, considering how much negativity and hostility had been directed its way from many of those powers it is now so open-handed with.It is no secret that Turkey has long harboured ambitions to join the European Union, having made an application to accede to the EU&rsquo;s predecessor, the European Economic Community, in 1987.&nbsp;Since then, Turkey has faced hurdle after hurdle despite bending over backwards to facilitate the demands placed on it by EU leaders. Nevertheless, and even though it has an established secularist tradition with close to a century of westernisation efforts, &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; Turkey&rsquo;s accession has always been resisted by &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; Europe.The racism and discrimination do not end there. During the seemingly never-ending Brexit debate, one of the key advocates for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU, Boris Johnson, began actively fear-mongering that 80 million Turks would be on their way to migrate to Britain if Brexit did not happen. He also ramped up fears of a mass refugee influx to Britain by claiming Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had his &ldquo;hand on the tap&rdquo; and could send Syrians and other refugees to the UK.That man is now the prime minister and was himself stricken by the coronavirus where his country&rsquo;s National Health Service has been feeling significant strain and is currently being sent several relief packages from Turkey.Even in terms of Turkey&rsquo;s vital interests, Ankara has repeatedly been snubbed by its &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;allies&rdquo; in favour of Marxist terrorist organisations.Western powers, led by the United States, made no secret of the fact they were supplying arms to the (YPG), a group so intimately tied to the PKK terrorist organisation that it is impossible to know where one begins and the other ends.While the PKK is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and most of its NATO allies, the YPG was conveniently compartmentalised away from the PKK in the eyes of Western lawmakers so they could use YPG terrorists against Daesh terrorists in Syria. This was no honest mistake, as now-retired US General Raymond Thomas himself admitted the YPG was simply a rebrand of the PKK.Moving forward post-coronavirusMuch of the anti-Turkish hostility outlined above is very recent and showed a complete disregard for Turkey&rsquo;s legitimate interests in terms of security for its borders and citizens. Turkey has consistently been mistreated by those it is now sending significant quantities of aid to.Sadly, and considering the pragmatic and cynical way global politics often works, it is unlikely that this hostility towards Turkey will change.&nbsp;Although Ankara has once again demonstrated that it is both good and beneficial to have Turkey as a friend and ally, the track record of these countries and their political leadership shows that Turkey should not believe their humanitarian efforts to fight off the most significant global public health crisis faced in living memory will bank them any goodwill.It is entirely fair to say that Turkey has often been unable to advance its point of view to an international audience. Turkey is now developing its soft power, but when compared to small but resource-rich nations like Qatar &ndash; who wields the media giant Al Jazeera Network and an array of smaller boutique outlets as an effective lever of power &ndash; Ankara is still in the process of developing and advancing this capability.With the impending global economic crisis that may exceed the Great Depression in its damage, Turkey could do worse than to invest in maximising its media and lobbying potential to better channel its perspective into influential capitals around the world.&nbsp;It would be enormously beneficial for Turkey to enhance its image as a friend to populations around the world, and not only their political leadership, as it could then find itself enjoying the support of the public in pressuring their governments to treat Turkey as it deserves &ndash; as a friend to cherish and support, not an adversary to be undermined and attacked at every turn.

The launch market needs to decrease the cost of the satellites. Besides, SpaceX desires to do with reusability of the orbit access cost. Anyhow, the cargo cost being placed, where there would be no reason to increase the demand for launches. The internal effort of SpaceX is to enter Starlink and develop it from scratch. The vast majority of cheap and reliable mass- producible satellite operates the software and hardware and also orbits within the broadband network. The comparable companies such as Oneweb focused on introducing a new generation of miniaturized satellites. This is created to set for the future where the price of orbital payloads decreases just as the cost of launching them.

Goodbye to the “socialist” bogeyman. Trump and the GOP yearned to run against Bernie in order to conjure the evils of socialism. But not only have they been denied Bernie, they’ve lost that phony issue as well. How can they scream about socialism when a pandemic is compelling Republicans to spend trillions of government dollars? There’s an old joke that a conservative is a liberal who’s been mugged. This year, a liberal is a conservative who needs a handout.
 Some historical perspective, please. Democrats always freak out about their nominee. They need to get a grip. I covered the 2008 Democratic Convention, and I remember that people were worried that Barack Obama would lose the race. He wound up winning the biggest Democratic majority since LBJ in 1964.
 And in April 1992, presumptive nominee Bill Clinton was running third in the polls – behind incumbent George Bush and nutty Ross Perot. I was covering that race as well, and that month I described Clinton as “the laggard runner in a three-man marathon, a leaky vessel that had dropped anchor in the Bermuda Triangle.”
 Clinton went on to become the first Democrat since FDR to win two elections.
 So skip the woe for Uncle Joe. Trump got himself impeached for trying to smear his foe at the starting gate. Just ask yourself why he tried.

A lot has changed since 1840, when Pierre-Joseph Proudhon published _What is Property?_ But the ‘prejudice’ for government which Proudhon slammed is alive and kicking. Anarchist analysis of the state as a colonising process, of militarism, patriotism, what used to be called ‘sex slavery’ — domination in the round — is still potent. Anarchism has also evolved — so there’s plenty of material out there for people interested in ecology, education, crime, social policy, religion, consumer cultures, democracy, work.

I know we talked about the 81 team with one in the hole but it was very, very rare. So maybe if Joe Royle was managing later he would have worked with that front three more easily because a lot of teams play with three up front now and three in midfield, which probably wasn’t the case back then.

Intel's NUCs have always seemed like crazy projects developed by the company's in-house small form-factor fetishists, with no thought towards how their innovations can be used by the rest of the industry. But with the NUC 9 Extreme, Intel is finally building a genuine platform that other companies can adopt. It's the core architecture of Razer's Tomahawk PC, which is slightly larger than Intel's reference kit, but can also fit in a full-sized graphics card. You'll be able to move your Compute Unit between all of these kits, which adds another level of modularity to the entire concept. If another company makes a case with more features, you can easily jump ship.

I don’t try to find ‘lessons’ in the work of any of the anarchists in the series. I try to highlight concepts or issues which, to my mind, continue to resonate or which have been wrongly overlooked: free agreement, ‘science’, propaganda, democracy, obedience and so forth. I think it’s helpful to discuss how earlier anarchists approached these ideas or problems, particularly since their approaches often fly in the face of established conventions. If we want to build alternatives, we don’t need to reinvent the wheel or rely on frameworks that are antipathetic to anarchist ways of thinking. We can use the history.

We love VanMoof's electric bicycles, but they're hardly an impulse purchase. The Electrified S2 and X2, for instance, launched with a $2,598 price-tag two years ago -- and that was with an $800 early-bird discount. For its third-gen lineup, then, it's no surprise that the company has chosen refinement and affordability over expensive innovations. The new S3 and X3 will cost $1,998 which, while undeniably expensive, is the cheapest e-bike range that VanMoof has ever put together. It's technically an "introduction price," but one that shouldn't change unless COVID-19 has a massive impact on the business. "We're launching at this price and we intend to keep [the] S3 and X3 at this price," a spokesperson told Engadget.From afar, the S3 and X3 look the same as their stylish predecessors. The S3 has a conventional frame shape and 28-inch wheels that are designed for riders between 175cm and 210cm tall. The X3, meanwhile, has a head-turning 'cross' frame and 24-inch wheels that suit a slightly smaller cyclist. The city- centric frame also has a small space on the front with stretchy straps for stowing a bag or small parcel. In the past, VanMoof has sold a basket accessory that clips onto this part of the frame, making it even easier to transport grocery bags and other precarious items. Don't be fooled by the familiar silhouettes, though. "Under the hood, everything is different," Job Stehmann, chief product designer at VanMoof told Engadget. "I think 90 percent of the parts are different." VanMoof Like the S2 and X2, the new models have a 250-500W motor that can help you reach 25 KMH (15.5MPH) in Europe and 32 KMH (20MPH) in the US -- the maximum allowed by each region's lawmakers at the moment. It's now "near-silent" at top speed, though, and the housing is "sleeker and more compact" than the version that shipped in the previous bikes.The motor might be similar, but the ride and performance should be dramatically different. VanMoof's new S3 and X3 bikes have four gears -- double what their predecessors had -- that should make it easier to ride around town without breaking a sweat. "This is the sweet spot that gets you, in a city environment, up and down a hill," Stehmann said, "while still keeping a system that doesn't shift so often that it annoys you like hell." All VanMoof bicycles have automatic and electronic gear shifting, which can now be fine-tuned through a companion app. The always-satisfying Boost button makes a return, too, with "extra on-demand power" for overtaking other cyclists, conquering slopes and accelerating away from traffic lights."The people who rode an [Electrified] S and S2, if they ride this bike, they will feel an enormous shift in performance," Stehmann said.The S3 and X3 ship with a 504Wh battery -- the same as their second-gen predecessors -- that can take you up to 150KM (93 miles) on a single charge. Your experience will depend on the mode you're riding in -- higher levels of assist will drain the battery faster -- and the terrain you're often tackling. VanMoof X3 VanMoof's much- hyped safety features are making a return, too. The S3 and X3 have a Kick Lock button on the rear hub which, once nudged, immobilises the back wheel and activates an escalating alarm system. You can then unlock the bike through the companion app, Bluetooth proximity, or by tapping a short code with the left- side button on the handlebars. In theory, the rear-hub lock and attention- grabbing alarm should deter most would-be thieves. It's not a perfect system, though, as someone could carefully lift the bike into a truck and drive away before you have time to react. If that happens, the frame's built-in location tracking will kick in. You can retrieve it solo or, via VanMoof's Peace of Mind subscription service, pay for some professional 'bike hunters' to go on your behalf. If the retrieval squad doesn't succeed within two weeks, VanMoof will give you a replacement. At the time of writing, a three-year subscription costs $290, with a $98 replacement fee if your bike is stolen a second or third time. After that, you're basically on your own and will need to pay full-price.Like the S2 and X2, the bike has a weather-proof Matrix Display embedded in the frame's top tube. Comprising 166 LEDs, it can show your bike's charge level, speed, gear and motor-assisted power level, a skull when the alarm is triggered, and numerous animations that indicate when it's woken up, powering down and charging. The speaker has also been improved, according to VanMoof, so you can hear better on windy days.The S3 and X3 contain a bunch of other small but welcome changes. Both bikes have hydraulic disc brakes, rather than mechanical, and 'invisible' cables that run through the handlebars. The integrated lights have been tweaked, too, and a future software update will let you pick between 'beam' and 'halo' illumination. The fender flaps are a little more ergonomic, the matte frames have a better scratch-resistant finish, and the included charger is smaller than before. VanMoof has even overhauled the unpacking experience so that it's less wasteful and easier to understand. VanMoof "Every little detail, we did try to improve," Stehmann said. "But of course, the things that were already good, we didn't change radically."VanMoof hasn't made any drastic changes to its e-bike formula. You can't remove the battery, for instance, and charge it separately like many other e-bikes. The S3 and X3 don't fold, either, or charge your laptop and phone.The reduced price, though, keeps VanMoof competitive with other design- centric e-bikes such as the Cowboy, Coboc One, and anything by Riese & Muller. Stehmann said the company has achieved this cost saving by designing its own parts and, where possible, streamlining its manufacturing and assembly process. "We've worked for 10 years to ramp up and change the supply chain we had in place, to be independent from the bike industry," he explained. The team is also building more bikes -- and by extension, buying more parts -- which creates volume-based cost savings. "The biggest impact in price is the quantity," he added. "The quantity went up a lot, and that has a massive influence in electronics."That streamlining extends to VanMoof's broader product portfolio. Two years ago, the company sold the S2 and X2 without a battery (hence why the motorized versions were branded Electrified S2 and X2). The third-generation will have no such option, though. "For me it was like a funeral," Stehmann said. "Burying the smart bike. It was such a great bike and we learned a lot from it." To survive and grow, though, VanMoof needs to specialize. "We have to stick to our mission," the designer added. "If we want to change the way we move in cities then we do need to focus." VanMoof The company appears to be searching for its Tesla Model 3 moment -- a combination of price and quality that will turn VanMoof's e-bike into a mainstream success. Stehmann believes $2,500 is the "sweet spot" which, now that they've beaten, will radically change their sales. "We know you attract a different kind of person when you go under that price," he said. "And that's also the goal. Our goal is to get as many people on bikes as we can. The product, we can easily double the price and still make good business out of that, I think. Of course you will sell less, but it doesn't matter. But we're not in it for that game. We're in it to change it for good. And that means we need to step in radically with the price as well."Is $1,998 low enough to trigger such a phenomenon? I'm not sure, but it's the closest the company has come to building an e-bike for the masses.
