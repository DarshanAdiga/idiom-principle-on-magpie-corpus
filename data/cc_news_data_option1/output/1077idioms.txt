NEW YORK -- U.S. movie theaters have closed nationwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, turning dark nearly all of the country's 40,000-plus screens in an unprecedented shutdown.
 The largest chains had tried to remain open even as Hollywood postponed its upcoming release plans and guidelines for social distancing steadily diminished the recommended size of crowds. But after President Donald Trump on Monday urged against gatherings of more than 10 people, AMC Theaters, the nation's largest chain, said Tuesday its theaters would close altogether.
    Coronavirus reaches Massachusetts: Here's what we know, latest updates town- by-town  
 AMC said the latest guidelines made movie theater operations "essentially impossible." It said it would close all locations in the U.S. for at least six to 12 weeks. Regal, the second largest chain, said Monday that its theaters would close until further notice.
 With movie theaters locked down for the foreseeable future, some studios took the extraordinary step of funneling new or recently released films onto home viewing platforms. Universal Pictures said Monday it will make its current and upcoming films available for on-demand rental, becoming the first major studio to break the traditional theatrical window of 90 days.
 The studio said it will put movies currently in theaters -- "Invisible Man," "The Hunt," "Emma" -- up for rental as early as Friday. It also said that "Trolls World Tour," one of the only major releases left on the April calendar, will debut in theaters and on-demand services simultaneously. A 48-hour rental will cost $19.99.

 Most of Europe's cinemas have already shut down, as have those in China, India and elsewhere. North America's shutdown came gradually. On Sunday, the mayors of New York and Los Angeles ordered their cities' theaters closed. Governments in Massachusetts and Quebec also closed theaters.
 Over the weekend, ticket sales plunged to their lowest levels in at least 20 years at U.S. and Canadian theaters. Not since a quiet September weekend in 2000 has weekend box office revenue been so low, according to data firm Comscore.
 Universal's move could be seen as either a watershed moment for Hollywood or an aberration due to extreme circumstances. With few exceptions, the major studios have guarded the 90-day exclusivity window even as digital newcomers like Netflix and Amazon have challenged it. For the studios, box office still is the primary revenue generator. Last week, the Motion Picture Association said worldwide ticket sales reached $42.2 billion last year.
 The National Association of Theater Owners, the trade group that represents movie exhibitors, declined to comment.
 NBCUniversal is prepping its own streaming service, dubbed Peacock, but it isn't to launch until July 15. On Sunday, the Walt Disney Co. made "Frozen 2" available on its streaming service, Disney Plus. But that film had already completed its theatrical run. Its digital release didn't break the traditional 90-day theatrical exclusivity window.
 Still, Hollywood's major upcoming releases aren't currently heading for the home; they're being held for when theaters reopen. Paramount Pictures' "A Quiet Place Part II," earlier slated for release Friday, has been removed from the schedule. Disney's "Mulan" and the James Bond film "Die Another Day" have been put off. Universal earlier pushed its latest "Fast and Furious" movie, "F9," from late May to April of next year.
 The boutique studio A24 said Monday that it will re-release the acclaimed "First Cow," which opened in limited release March 6, later this year, since its initial bow has been marred by theater closures.

“It is hard to convince your political leaders to really shut things down if you don’t have any cases yet,” Radhakrishna said. “We wanted to start with counties that were ready to come on board with this level of shelter in place. Early action is essential to flatten the curve.”
 He said the counties decided that BART trains should continue to run because they carry many essential workers.

One of the people still on the ballot today, as voting goes ahead in Illinois, is Kim Foxx. She's one of the country's most powerful lawyers, the state's attorney for Cook County, which includes Chicago. She manages the second- largest prosecutor's office in the U.S. Since her election more than three years ago, she has tried to reform the way cases are prosecuted, and that has led to both praise and criticism. Today voters decide if she'll stay in office. Here's NPR's Cheryl Corley.

CORLEY: The debate over policy and practice in the state's attorney's office erupted over the Jussie Smollett case. He's the TV actor who Chicago Police said filed a false police report. He claimed last year that he was the victim of a homophobic and racist attack. He faced 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct; all were dropped. That caused a firestorm of criticism and questions about whether Foxx, who had recused herself, actually had a hand in the case behind the scenes. Smollett now faces new charges, and a special prosecutor is investigating how Foxx's office handled the case.

“When we reach out and say, ‘What’s happening? What’s the rationale?’ all we hear is, ‘Our hands are tied,’” Tabaddour said. “We’re told we can’t do anything without higher-ups clearing it.”
 Jeremy McKinney of the American Immigration Lawyers Association added calls for officials to use liberal discretion in granting parole and bond from immigration detention. He also called for people in the Remain in Mexico program, which requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico and cross back and forth over the border for their hearings, to be paroled into the country due to the crisis.
 Immigration courts are not the only place where federal immigration policies are continuing to conduct business in ways that defy public health recommendations.
 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency responsible for naturalizations, green cards and a slew of other immigration services, had at least 50 people waiting in line outside its downtown San Diego office on Tuesday morning, according to an immigration attorney.
 Immigration lawyer Thomas Haine, whose office is on another floor of the same building, said the way that USCIS was continuing to operate appeared irresponsible to him in light of the increasingly strict guidelines limiting in-person interactions due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 “To be continuing to be open like that is just insane,” Haine said.
 Generally, people with USCIS appointments enter the Front Street building on the ground floor and pass through security screenings before taking elevators up to a waiting area.
 Haine said people wait in that area between 40 minutes and a few hours for their turns with USCIS officials who will decide whether to grant their immigration and naturalization requests. Those interviews happen in small office rooms that place people in close proximity, Haine said.

CORLEY: Foxx often talks about where she's from and how it shapes her push for criminal justice reform. She grew up in Chicago public housing, at one point was homeless, knew both victims of gun violence and the shooters. One of her many reforms is to no longer charge shoplifters with a felony if they take less than $1,000. A higher priority, she says, is prosecuting violent crime and gun crimes. She told supporters recently, her approach has become a model for the nation.

“This is a fast, moving target,” he said. “I think the county health officers are doing an admirable, good job.”
 He said he had no intention of using the police force to enforce the shelter- in-place order, hoping that residents would follow it without issues.
 “They’re not going to be knocking on doors to check,” he said.
 Dr. Rohan Radhakrishna, Contra Costa County deputy health officer, said an association of Bay Area health officers held telephone conferences throughout the weekend to draft the order.
 He said each county communicated with its city leaders. In Contra Costa County, some of the mayors were concerned about the order’s impact on the economy, but eventually agreed it was appropriate.
 “We felt strongly that viruses cross borders, people cross borders and public health mitigation measures must also cross borders to be effective,” Radhakrishna said.
 Without mentioning names, he predicted that other counties will follow suit as more cases develop.
 Solano and Napa are two that have declined to issue orders, although there were reports that Sonoma County health authorities were considering something similar.
