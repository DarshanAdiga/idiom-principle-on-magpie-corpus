For more than 50 years, L.Q. Jones was a familiar supporting character actor in some 100 films and hundreds more television shows. Lanky, tough and athletic, Jones could tackle any role although was often cast as the "heavy" in westerns and dramas, projecting the "bad guy" image with merely a sinister smirk or a menacing twinkle in the eye.      Born and raised in Texas as Justus McQueen, relatives took care of the young boy after his mother was killed in a car accident.      "I was born in Beaumont, although they may try to disclaim me, but it's too late now!" says Jones, who turned 93 on Aug. 19. "We moved around quite a bit, to Houston to Dallas to Oklahoma City, back to Beaumont, and finally Port Neches. I had a horse by the time I was 8 or 9 and grew up around tough rodeo people - my uncle was into roping - so westerns were easy and fun."      In college, at the University of Texas at Austin, his roommate for over a year was Fess Parker. While the future "Daniel Boone" actor moved west to Hollywood, McQueen headed south and took up ranching in Nicaragua. When Parker sent his buddy a copy of Leon Uris' war novel "Battle Cry," about to be filmed, McQueen thought one character could be his ticket to Hollywood.      "Fess encouraged me to come out and drew me a map on the back of a laundry shirt stuffing showing how to get to the studio. Within two days of arriving, I had the part of L.Q. Jones in 'Battle Cry' and probably would never have been in the business had it not been for Fess."      Despite lacking Hollywood experience, McQueen had worked some comedy acts during college to help pay the bills, so he took to playing the comic relief character in the 1955 war drama to act like a veteran. Adopting his screen character's name as his own, the lad from Texas quickly settled into Hollywood.      Jones was cast in Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch," having become a favorite among the director's casting repertoire. "Sam was a genius and I loved him, but he was a basket case. He drove everybody nuts."      That was evident during the production of "Major Dundee" with Charlton Heston.      "Heston was using a real saber for one scene," he recalled. "Sam made him so mad, Chuck came within an eyelash of cutting Sam in two - and it scared Chuck because he damn near did it. Sam found a way to get under your skin to get what he wanted out of you."      While Jones calls "The Wild Bunch" a "hell of a movie," he says Peckinpah's "'Ride the High Country' was the best Sam ever made, just gorgeous to watch, although I cry like a baby at the ending." Jones is a member of a ruthless family that tackles Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott as they attempt to rescue Mariette Hartley.      "Joel was the best human being I ever met and Randy wasn't far behind him, so the two of them together make one of the best Saturday afternoon westerns you could ever sit and watch over a bowl of popcorn."      While he had a few lead film roles, Jones says he enjoyed his supporting roles and went after every job he could. But there was one he missed.      "I was at my agent's one day and the phone rang. It was Stanley Kubrick offering a part in 'Dr. Strangelove.' Well, I would have walked barefoot across the state to work with him, but when he was ready to shoot I was tied up with another picture. The role (of Major 'King' Kong) went to Slim Pickens. But thank goodness it did, could you imagine anyone else in that part?"      Jones appeared in movies with countless fellow character actors, not to mention big stars such as James Coburn, Audie Murphy, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Glenn Ford. He even appeared in three Elvis Presley films. But his first role in "Battle Cry" provided a valuable lesson.      "I had a hundred 'directors' \- lighting, sound, wardrobe people, all the crew helping out a rookie actor and everyone helping each other," says Jones. "You learn from them, work your butt off, and with a little luck have a successful career. I suppose I could have worked my way up the acting food chain, but character work was very rewarding and great fun. I loved playing the heavies because I could do what I wanted and got to work with the best in the business, so I consider myself very lucky."   Nick Thomas teaches at Auburn University at Montgomery, Alabama, and has written features, columns and interviews for more than 850 newspapers and magazines. The interview with Jones was conducted in 2017. See www.getnickt.org.

Vyas, who has two children aged nine and five, evaded justice for more than a decade, leaving Britain weeks after his attack on Ms Samaraweera.
 But after a 2010 police appeal, which saw police send more than 60,000 leaflets including CCTV images of the suspect, Vyas's former employer contacted authorities.
 Vyas had already fled to India but was arrested and finally extradited in October 2019.
 Detective Sergeant Shaleena Sheikh said: "Vyas carried out horrific and violent attacks on four women which, tragically, culminated in the murder of Michelle Samaraweera. He then did all he could to evade responsibility for his crimes and fled to India.
 "He added further distress to those he hurt by subjecting them to a trial. I would like to commend the dignity and bravery shown by his victims and their families throughout this process, which has lasted over 10 years.
 "Despite having DNA from the scenes of the crimes, Vyas was not on the database and this prompted a lengthy and complex investigation, which saw more than 1,100 DNA swabs taken and 1,815 addresses visited. We also issued more than 60,500 posters displaying an image of the suspect.
 "The scale of this investigation has been remarkable and the case has lasted a decade, taking our inquiries to many different countries and resulting in a lengthy extradition process."
 Vyas has already served just over two years on remand in India and the UK and will be eligible for release after 34 years, although the judge said he may never be freed.

“The more houses we have this side, the more people will be crossing to access the leisure park. There is no safe crossing for families, children or adults to get there.”
 In her report to the committee, Angela Briggs, the council’s planning team leader, accepted that “specific consultee comments” had been raised in regards to a link to the new cinema and leisure park off Downham Road.
 “The questions specifically related to why there was not a direct link from the site to the leisure park,” she said.
 “Phase 3 is the closest of the sites to the leisure park and would appear to be in the best location to offer this. “However, the site is also close to the A10 which is a very busy single carriageway of 60mph traffic speeds.”
 She said that prior to the submission of their application, Taylor Wimpey took on board these questions and spoke to the LHA about providing a footpath connection in the south/western corner of the development to the existing A10 roundabout.
 “This was considered as fundamentally dangerous by the LHA and a pedestrian link would not be supported on highway safety grounds,” she said.
 “There is a dropped kerb crossing at the end of Downham Road, before the A10/Little Downham roundabout which then leads to the underpass to the leisure park.
 “Furthermore, this area is outside of the application site and an additional crossing in this location is not required by the S106 or the outline planning permission, and therefore the local planning authority cannot insist that this is provided.”
 Ms Briggs said the layout therefore retains the cycle link to Cam Drive which would link to this dropped kerb towards the leisure park and towards Lynn Road in the other direction.
 Planning manager Rebecca Saunt told the committee that the Taylor Wimpey site bound the A10 to the west, the Phase 1 (Hopkins Homes) development to the east, and Cam Drive to the south.
 The scheme was part of the much larger proposals for the area that was approved in 2016 to create a ‘special extension to a special city’.
 Outline planning permission was approved in 2016 with a S106 legal agreement for up to 1200 homes, employment and community uses including a care home and an extra care home.
 Councillors questioned how easy it would be to cycle to the city centre; the planning manager replied that this had been dealt with as part of the outline application but there was a cycle route along the front of the site.
 The application approved.

With the inclusion of a growing number of Black folks, the DNC is surely counting on that to be true.

“This morning, I spoke with Postmaster General DeJoy and conveyed to him that his announcement is not a solution and is misleading. The Postmaster General’s alleged pause is wholly insufficient and does not reverse damage already wreaked,” Pelosi said in a statement on Wednesday. “The Postmaster General frankly admitted that he had no intention of replacing the sorting machines, blue mailboxes and other key mail infrastructure that have been removed and that plans for adequate overtime, which is critical for the timely delivery of mail, are not in the works.”

Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (WPM) shares on Wednesday's trading session, dropped -2.50 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $51.52 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of $0.79 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $1.30 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -80.00% and predicted to reach at 28.97% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was -19.10% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 22.68% for the next five year.

Taylor Wimpey representatives revealed the lack of a cycling route during a planning committee meeting at East Cambridgeshire District Council. The firm was "signing off" its reserved matters approval that includes landscaping, layout and appearance for the site north of Cam Drive off the A10. This is the second phase of development on the site which formed part of the wider North Ely scheme. Dan Humphries, planning co-ordinator for Taylor Wimpey East Anglia and his colleagues planning manager Andrew Wright and engineer manager Martyn Rodzian addressed the committee and answered questions. Councillor Alec Jones said he was largely happy with the proposals "but noted that the local highways authority (LHA) had raised a number of issues". These included the fact that the cycle path did not link up going towards the leisure centre. He asked if there was any reason why this was not included in the design. Mr Humphries replied that they had spoken to the LHA about a new connection "but had been steered away from it, as the LHA was not happy, on health and safety grounds, with taking pedestrians to the 60-mph carriageway". It had been a point raised by a resident as part of consultations on the reserved matters application. "I strongly believe that if we are to have more houses, and this side of the pedestrian access to the leisure park, then we need a pedestrian crossing going across Downham Road which leads into the grassed area to the underpass," he wrote. "Crossing the road to the cut through to the grassed area is treacherous. "The more houses we have this side, the more people will be crossing to access the leisure park. There is no safe crossing for families, children or adults to get there." In her report to the committee, Angela Briggs, the council's planning team leader, accepted that "specific consultee comments" had been raised in regards to a link to the new cinema and leisure park off Downham Road. "The questions specifically related to why there was not a direct link from the site to the leisure park," she said. "Phase 3 is the closest of the sites to the leisure park and would appear to be in the best location to offer this. "However, the site is also close to the A10 which is a very busy single carriageway of 60mph traffic speeds." She said that prior to the submission of their application, Taylor Wimpey took on board these questions and spoke to the LHA about providing a footpath connection in the south\/western corner of the development to the existing A10 roundabout. "This was considered as fundamentally dangerous by the LHA and a pedestrian link would not be supported on highway safety grounds," she said. "There is a dropped kerb crossing at the end of Downham Road, before the A10\/Little Downham roundabout which then leads to the underpass to the leisure park. "Furthermore, this area is outside of the application site and an additional crossing in this location is not required by the S106 or the outline planning permission, and therefore the local planning authority cannot insist that this is provided." Ms Briggs said the layout therefore retains the cycle link to Cam Drive which would link to this dropped kerb towards the leisure park and towards Lynn Road in the other direction. Planning manager Rebecca Saunt told the committee that the Taylor Wimpey site bound the A10 to the west, the Phase 1 (Hopkins Homes) development to the east, and Cam Drive to the south. The scheme was part of the much larger proposals for the area that was approved in 2016 to create a 'special extension to a special city'. Outline planning permission was approved in 2016 with a S106 legal agreement for up to 1200 homes, employment and community uses including a care home and an extra care home. Councillors questioned how easy it would be to cycle to the city centre; the planning manager replied that this had been dealt with as part of the outline application but there was a cycle route along the front of the site. The application approved.

Next, perhaps realizing that blatant Obamagate lie had already been debunked too many times over, Trump dug deeper into his already very big pockets of conspiracy theories. This time he tried to disingenuously suggest that Obama was reluctant to endorse Biden. Trump threw in some name-calling for good measure and injected another social media strategy: using open-ended questions in his tweets. With all-caps, natch.

Grandi, on his first official mission since March, when lockdowns were imposed in Europe due to the pandemic, is visiting Lebanon two weeks after a catastrophic explosion at the Port of Beirut destroyed a large part of its capital Beirut.
 The Aug. 4 blast killed a least 180 people, injured about 6,000 and left nearly 300,000 people with major damage to their homes. It was the most destructive single incident in Lebanon’s history, leaving losses worth between $10 and $15 billion.
 There are 30 still missing after the explosion. Among those killed were 43 Syrians — a reflection of the country being host to the largest number of refugees per capita — and Grandi said some refugees are among those still missing.
 More than 1 million Syrian refugees are in Lebanon, having fled the war next door.
