The tape, which sold at less than half its top price estimate of $20,000, features McCartney on vocals on one track and another with Starr singing.            Former Radio Luxembourg DJ Tony Prince owned the demo, which came into his possession after he was asked to find artists to record it as a cover. It sold as part of a collection of his music memorabilia.            Ahead of the sale, the auction house's Paul Fairweather told British newspaper The Times the "track certainly had enough about it to be included in the album," and added: "It's fantastic to be able to bring to the market a previously unheard and unreleased track. I am sure if Paul was to release this himself it would certainly prove a hit with fans."
