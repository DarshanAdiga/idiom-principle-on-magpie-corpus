Many conifer forests in the western United States contain too many trees, packed too closely together. This crowding is a result of past management practices that suppressed wildfires and prioritized timber harvesting. In recent years, climate warming, accumulation of dead wood on the forest floor and a buildup of small trees - which serve as "ladder fuels," moving fire from the forest floor up into the canopy - have led to hotter, larger wildfires.

"The Villa game was great to get the goals in an emphatic win, it doesn't matter who it's against, it's important to put the ball in the back of the net.
 "And then Bristol Rovers, we conceded that first-minute goal and for 20 minutes we became a bit frantic, but we've got to learn from that, keep calm, understand how we're going to get back in games, and we've got to take that lesson with us.
 "As the game wore on we got better and better, got the goal back and really should have won the game in terms of the overall stats. It was a game we completely dominated.
 "Then we've gone down to Oxford and I was very pleased with the win down there, because it's a tough place to go, as everyone knows. They're a team which will be up and around the top six, I would imagine.
 "Certainly in the second period I thought we were very good and it was an excellent win.
 "At home to Peterborough, I thought the first-half on reflection, we didn't play with enough tempo in our game.
 "I think a bit of that was the way Peterborough played. They almost let you have the ball, but I didn't think we imposed ourselves enough in that first half. But the second half was a lot better and a great, well-taken penalty by Grant (Leadbitter) got us the win."
 Sunderland dominated the game at Charlton without getting their reward.
 And while a point at The Valley was more than respectable, Parkinson knows it could have been more.
 "Then the Charlton game, away from home against a team which has just come down, the first half was very good," he added. "We had some excellent chances and we should have come in at half-time ahead.
 "We've got to add the clinical side to our game, or improve on that, because it's very rare to dominate the game for the whole 90 minutes.
 "But when you have periods of pressure it's important we capitalise on it.

The shift from employment in businesses that produce goods to those that provide services is expected to continue in the coming years. In 2000, about 82 percent of jobs in Maine were in service industries, up from 56 percent in 1950. By 2028, that number is expected to climb to 87 percent, according to the state forecast. The largest job growth is expected in the health care and social assistance sectors, driven by a need to care for the state’s aging population. Leisure and hospitality jobs are also expected to grow.

“In the wake of George Floyd I think a lot of companies, not just Disney, had to do some soul searching in regards to how they addressed their Black consumers and their Black employees. The company is a company that wants to be on the right side of history and do the right thing. To have them step up in the way that they did was great for me as a Black man but then also to kind of be in support of projects like this that help drive the conversation forward,” he said. “It just became a special experience.”

Collins moves up a spot on this list, meaning she's now more likely to lose than she was two weeks ago. The Supreme Court fight has nationalized the race and put fresh scrutiny on Collins' 2018 vote for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which Democrats are now more aggressively deploying in messaging against her. But the four-term senator's biggest problem could be ranked-choice voting, which kicks in if no candidate receives a majority. With recent polling showing Collins under the 50% threshold, it's difficult to envision her winning outright. And if she doesn't, she'll have to contend with the supporters of third-party candidates potentially throwing their support to Democratic state House Speaker Sara Gideon. Inside Elections shifted the race from Toss-up to Tilt Democratic at the beginning of the month.

Another race that's making Republicans nervous is the second US Senate seat in Georgia, a demographically changing state. Appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler is on the ballot with candidates of all parties, including a Republican congressman who's pushing her to the right. A Quinnipiac University poll from late September showed Democrats starting to coalesce around Raphael Warnock, who led with 31%, followed by Loeffler and GOP Rep. Doug Collins in the lows 20s. However, given the unpredictability of a likely runoff -- and who makes it to the top two slots -- it's too early to know whether this seat will flip.

No one's doubting whether this is a race anymore, with public polling consistently showing the candidates tied. Democrat Jaime Harrison's eye- popping $57 million haul in the third quarter will give him plenty of resources to communicate and help turn out the vote in the final stretch. He's now getting outside assistance from national Democratic groups too. Graham has publicly pleaded for financial assistance, but investment from outside GOP groups isn't likely to level the spending playing field, especially when candidates get more favorable TV rates than outside groups. Republicans are hoping that this week's Supreme Court confirmation hearings will drive conservatives to Graham, who needs to coalesce support on the right. Democrats are trying to exploit that gap with a recent ad from Senate Majority PAC that features a golfer complaining that Graham hasn't taken advantage of his access to the President. A new 60-second Harrison spot, narrated by Viola Davis, features two White voters exchanging worried glances and then subtle smiles as one woman plants a Harrison sign in her front yard, while her neighbor waters his lawn. The implicit message? It's OK to vote for a Democrat in South Carolina. A third-party candidate dropped out of the race and endorsed Graham, but his name is still on the ballot, which means he could take some votes from the senator that Graham can't afford to lose.

Why? Well, Dani and Jamie's lesbian love story joyfully caught me off guard because it's unfortunately just so rare to see romance between two women depicted on camera—even in 2020. Immediately after watching, I thought of my lesbian sister and her wife, who share two children. As a gay man, it's liberating to watch a fun, at-times silly show and then discover a very-queer plot twist ripe for discussion in your family group text. It opens the door for my sister and I to bond over something, _anything_ queer in pop culture. A feeling that is few and far between.
