The stringent regulatory structure is expected to create a significant impact on the growth of the market in the long term. The regulations are more stringent in North America and EU compared to Asia-Pacific region. The differences in the regulations hamper the trade between different economies. The rising cost of raw material is having a high impact in short term, however the impact is expected to be reduced in the long term as innovations and technologies are being introduced in extraction process which will lead to cost reduction.

A drive through the South Shore paints a picture of a relatively split electorate.
 There's a store that sells nothing but pro-President Donald Trump shirts, hats and stickers in Hanson, but in Norwell there are residential streets with Joe Biden signs in every front yard.
 Mayors in Quincy and Weymouth lean to the right, but every Massachusetts representative in Congress is a Democrat.
 In the State House, South Shore senators and representatives are relatively evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.
 Locally, the region's voters elect officials who run the gamut.
 But when it comes to casting a vote for president, the South Shore and the state have voted Democratic for nearly two decades. And officials say that's unlikely to change.
 "I don't expect the tide to turn. I think Biden will do well throughout Massachusetts, including the South Shore, but he will likely do less well in the South Shore than in other areas," Paul Watanabe, professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, said. "This area has shown over the last decade or so that there are some pockets of Republican support in large towns and small. ... But I don't expect a giant change. I don't expect this area of the state to become a solidly Republican area, by any means."

 In 2016, South Shore voters lined up to support Hillary Clinton in even greater numbers than they did for Barack Obama, who defeated Mitt Romney in his home state of Massachusetts in 2012. Trump won a fraction of South Shore towns in the 2016 election. Carver, Hanover, Pembroke, Hanson, Kingston, Whitman and Halifax all voted for the current president.
 Watanabe said the South Shore has held on to conservatism despite a greater shift toward liberalism in other parts of the state, largely due to a general lack of racial diversity.
 "The Greater Boston area has largely diversified over the last decade. Some of the South Shore has as well, but much of the South Shore has been slower to diversify and remains majority white," he said. "While we see some parts of the South Shore, like Quincy and Randolph, which have seen tremendous transformation racially, we see less of this diversification in other communities and Republican support largely comes from those majority white populations."
 In some communities, Clinton's margin of victory was huge in 2016. She won by more than 30 percent in Milton and Randolph, and more than 20 percent in Quincy, Hingham and Cohasset. In other towns, she just scraped by. Clinton won Rockland by just 57 votes, Abington by 86 and Marshfield by 98.
 In Marshfield - where Clinton received 7,288 votes to Trump's 7,190 - Republican Town Committee Chairman Dennis McMath said he thinks a Republican victory could very well happen. He said voters in Marshfield and beyond are concerned about a lack of support for law enforcement on the Democratic ticket, and said many unenrolled voters are concerned about Biden's alignment with a "radical socialist" platform.
 "I fully expect Trump to do better this election," he said this week. "We have been doing two Trump/Back the Blue standouts at the Scituate Harbor rotary each week. The response has been overwhelming in support."
 Rachael Cobb, an associate professor of government at Suffolk University, said single-issue voters, like those who will vote solely based on law enforcement support, are rare. Most people have several plates spinning at once and are invested in multiple issues, she said, but added that there are plenty of single-issue groups that try to dominate the conversation and pull voters to one side or the other.
 "A single issue could be the motivator for a voter, but then you ask if there is a counter-movement that will draw people out," she said. "The question becomes 'Is that the issue that is putting everyone over the edge? Or is it the pandemic? Or is it the protests from this summer?' There are a lot of competing issues. ... There are just so many drivers this year. In a non- pandemic year, I could see (Back the Blue) maybe being the kicker for people, but there are so many things that could be the kicker this year."
 Watanabe said voters may choose the Republican ticket not only because Trump's platform is aligned with support for law enforcement, but because he's positioned himself in line with other issues important to conservative voters, such as gun ownership and abortion.
 "Many of these voters are drawn not by Trump's personality or character, but because of issues he's aligned himself with. Policies like that draw some voters to the Republican Party almost despite the fact that Trump is the candidate," he said. "Some voters will hold their noses and vote for Trump because he represents some of the values they have, not because they like him as an individual."
 In Pembroke, where Trump was victorious by 289 votes in 2016, Democratic Town Committee Chairwoman Jessica Rushing said liberal residents have stepped up to try to stop a second Trump victory.
 "Our DTC has had a ton of Pembroke residents asking how they can get involved and how they can make a difference," she said. "We've probably doubled the number of people at our meetings. I've seen an uptick in people who may have not made the effort before working to make sure it doesn't happen again."
 Rushing, who is also a selectman, said she hopes Trump's presidency is more likely to draw hordes of Democratic voters than Republican ones, but she's hesitant to make that assumption.
 "It does scare me," she said. "I'm hoping it's driving Democratic turnout. I'm hoping people who may have been complacent four years ago realize that this is not a time for sitting back and letting whatever happens happen. ... This is the most important election in a generation. I'm really hoping for an overwhelming blue wave that shows the policies that have been enacted under this administration are not the values we stand for as a country."
 Secretary of State William Galvin said earlier this month that he predicts a record-setting number of ballots will be cast, even exceeding the 75 percent voter turnout in the 2016 election.

 "I'm hopeful. It seems the level of interest is there," Galvin said. "We had 3.3 million votes in 2016. It seems we will exceed that."
 It's those voters -- newly registered residents or those who didn't turn out in 2016 -- who could shift the tide. In towns where just a few hundred votes or less made the difference, it's anyone's race, Cobb said.
 "There is huge interest, engagement and participation this year. It appears to be cutting across all demographic groups. Young people are engaged in numbers that are dramatically increased compared to previous elections," she said.
 Cobb said there are multiple reasons the 2016 election may not be the best indicator of how people or communities will vote this time around. Just because the South Shore went blue in the last presidential race doesn't mean it will again.
 "We saw depressed turnout in 2016. Some of it because people didn't like any of the candidates, so they decided to stay home, and some people found themselves the victim of confusing changes to voter laws, so they didn't even try," Cobb said. "2016 was, given the protests that happened after Trump was elected, less of an indicator and more of a wake-up call. I think it has had a mobilizing effect."

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Friday claimed that his remarks about Muslims having “a right to kill millions of French people for the massacres of the past” were “taken out of context”, AP reported. He also criticised Facebook and Twitter for taking down his posts.
 Mohamad’s controversial comments came on Thursday shortly after three people were killed in a knife attack at a church in France’s Nice city. There has been unrest in the country after the beheading of a teacher near Paris earlier this month. The teacher had showed caricatures of Prophet Muhammad in class before the attack. Following this, French President Emmanuel Macron had vowed a crackdown on “Islamic extremism”.
 Mohamad’s comment was part of a blog, which was posted on Twitter and Facebook. It was later removed from both the sites for violating rules. On Friday, Mohamad wrote another blog post justifying his stand.
 “I am indeed disgusted with attempts to misrepresent and take out of context what I wrote on my blog,” Mohamad said in a statement, according to AP. He said critics failed to read his blog in full, especially the next sentence which read: “But by and large Muslims have not applied the ‘eye for an eye’ law. Muslims don’t. The French shouldn’t. Instead the French should teach their people to respect other people’s feelings.”
 He also said Twitter and Facebook removed the posting despite his explanation.
 “On the one hand, they defended those who chose to display offending caricatures of Prophet Mohamad... and expect all Muslims to swallow it in the name of freedom of speech and expression,” he added.
