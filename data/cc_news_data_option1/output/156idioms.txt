It no doubt helped the coach, too. Ramos led the U-20s to successful qualification in the next three World Cup cycles and reached the tournament's quarterfinal on all three occasions. He showed a steady rate of growth while also assisting Jurgen Klinsmann on the senior squad's staff. It probably would've taken both a truly exceptional candidate from abroad and highly auspicious timing for the Fed to boot Ramos from his post during those years. The long-term benefits of that stability seem to have since come into focus. Ramos recently departed to take over at the Houston Dynamo with his reputation enhanced and a useful legacy in his wake.

FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky lawmakers assembled bags of food to be distributed to children at risk of going hungry at an event planned by a House leader who remains hospitalized. Lawmakers from both parties formed assembly lines Monday to put pasta, canned vegetables, pudding cups, juice boxes and other food into bags. The goal was to distribute 2,100 bags of food to 18 schools or Head Start programs statewide, said Tamara Sandberg, executive director of Feeding Kentucky, a statewide association of food banks that organized the event. Each bag held enough food for three meals and two snacks. Lawmakers volunteered at an event planned by Senate President Robert Stivers and House Majority Floor Leader John “Bam\" Carney. Carney, a Campbellsville Republican, has been hospitalized since last month with a severe case of pancreatitis. Carney remains in “very, very serious condition,\" House Speaker David Osborne told reporters. The floor leader manages legislation during debates on the House floor and helps plan the daily legislative agenda. House Speaker Pro Tem David Meade manages activities on the GOP-dominated House floor in Carney's absence. Carney was on lawmakers' minds as they filled food bags. “He was excited about this, and I know he's thrilled to see us carry on with it,\" Osborne said.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Planned Parenthood is challenging Missouri's denial of claims for Medicaid payments for a second time in two years. KCUR reports that Planned Parenthood’s affiliates in Overland Park, Kansas, appealed Missouri's cutoff of their fiscal 2020 funding last week in Jackson County, Missouri, after an administrative law judge ruled against them last month. Meanwhile, an appeal of the cutoff of 2019 funding is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court. “It’s kind of a continuation of the same old song and dance,” said Charles Hatfield, Planned Parenthood’s attorney. Republican lawmakers in Missouri have for years sought to stop any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood, even clinics that do not provide abortions. But legislators struggled with “loopholes\" that allowed Planned Parenthood clinics that provide other healthcare to continue receiving funding. Abortion opponents finally succeeded by blocking money to any facility affiliated with others that perform abortions. Lawmakers were able to stop money from going to Planned Parenthood by forgoing some federal funding to avoid requirements that the clinics be reimbursed if low-income patients go there for birth control, cancer screenings and other preventative care. Missouri instead now uses state money to pay for those services. Planned Parenthood argues that some of its chapters provide preventative health care and not abortion, and therefore shouldn't be financially penalized. In all, the state has withheld roughly $1 million from Planned Parenthood over the past two fiscal years. Planned Parenthood has 12 clinics in Missouri, but only one of them performs abortions. That St. Louis clinic is the state's only remaining abortion clinic and is in a battle with state regulators...

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — The wild ride of the Gallagher family on “Shameless” is coming to an end. The series will air its 11th and final season this summer, Showtime entertainment president Gary Levine said Monday. The debut date was not immediately announced. “It will be one last hurrah for the Gallaghers and their unique blend of love and lechery,” Levine told a TV critics meeting. Producer John Wells and the cast have “promised to take ‘Shameless’ out with a bang.” William H. Macy stars as the family patriarch who gets by in life just about any way he can, setting a dubious example for his offspring and others in his orbit. The season 10 finale of “Shameless,” which also stars Jeremy Allen White, Ethan Cutkosky and Shanola Hampton, will air Jan. 26. Macy's wife, “Desperate Housewives” star Felicity Huffman, was involved in the college admissions scandal and sentenced to two weeks in prison for paying $15,000 to have a test proctor correct their daughter's SAT answers.

Daniel Marx, another attorney representing Carter, argued in his filing to the justices last year that his client "did not cause Conrad Roy's tragic death and should not be held criminally responsible for his suicide."
 "This petition focuses on just two of the many flaws in the case against her that raise important federal constitutional issues for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide," he wrote in the filing.
 Carter had faced up to 20 years behind bars, but her defense attorney at the time of her conviction asked for five years of supervised probation with required mental health counseling. She ultimately received a 15-month sentence.

With the assumption of the word "serve" in the Canon, the liturgical meaning of this term was adopted in a certain way - to conform with the novelty of the Christian cult.

During Lent the hymn that introduces the Office of Readings of the Liturgy of the Hours - the Office that monks once recited during the night vigil before God and for humanity - one of the duties of Lent is described with the imperative: arctius perstemus in custodia - we must be even more intensely alert.

At the end of the day, the idea that the Oscar nominee slate isn’t particularly diverse is absolutely a problem. But it pales in comparison to how non-diverse Hollywood is as a whole. That’s changing (more big movies were directed by women in 2019 than ever before, for example), but at a glacial pace. And as long as that’s true, the 15 to 20 movies that the Oscars seriously consider are more likely than not to be about — and made by — straight white men.

Perhaps the most glaring omission was Lulu Wang’s _The Farewell_, a stunner of a family drama that netted star Awkwafina a Golden Globe for her performance.

Still, these omissions show that although the Academy has been working toward celebrating a broader and more diverse range of stories, particularly from younger directors, it still has a long way to go. _— AW_

The academy has made aggressive strides to diversify its membership since #OscarsSoWhite started five years ago, after the first of two consecutive years of all-white acting slates, and blew up the following year when black stars from "Creed," "Beasts of No Nation" and "Straight Outta Compton" were snubbed. (By comparison, there have been 19 Oscar-winning performances from 17 black performers.) But it's clear there's still a long way to go when it comes to not just nominating Asian actors and storytellers, but the industry giving them the opportunity to tell those stories in the first place and make it more of the norm. #neverforget that "Crazy Rich Asians" (2018) was the first studio film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years.

Lopez had been in the running for best supporting actress for her role as a dancer turned business mogul in "Hustlers." While the movie itself lacked the buzz of some others, Lopez's performance was hailed for being empowered and without reservations.
 Kathy Bates ("Richard Jewell"), Laura Dern ("Marriage Story"), Scarlett Johansson ("Jojo Rabbit"), Florence Pugh ("Little Women") and Margot Robbie ("Bombshell") ended up earning nominations.
 "Today is the day I start learning metalwork so I can hand craft the Oscar that Jennifer Lopez deserves," joked actress Melanie Lynskey on Twitter.
 (It's worth noting that Adam Sandler, who did not earn his own nomination for "Uncut Gems," was very happy for "Waterboy" co-star Bates.)
 Queen Bey had been in the running to be nominated for original song for "Spirit" from "The Lion King." A short-list released by the Academy in December that included the superstar did nothing except build hopes that Beyoncé would be nominated for her first Oscar. Alas, it was not meant to be.

 "Compared to the other shipping lines, our share of the inland business is lower percentage-wise," Engelstoft said.

Lyman says Shenandoah Police issued 32 tickets for violators of the city's snow removal ordinances.
 "That's a big much," he said. "But, you know, the first snow of the season, people tend to forget. So, hopefully we'll get some more compliance going here. I thought I saw a chance for more snow on Friday, as well."
 Last year, the Shenandoah City Council approved an increase in fines assessed to vehicle owners violating snow emergency parking regulations from $25 to $50. Violators not paying parking tickets after 30 days face an additional $20 fee. Failure to pay tickets after that brings in other penalties, such as having the city install boots on tires, or even impounding vehicles. Council members also approved a 28-E agreement with Page County, allowing the county treasurer to collect fees for not paying parking fines at vehicle registration time. Lyman says it's too early to tell whether the ordinance changes are impacting snow emergency parking violations.
 "I feel like the previous year that I've been around," said Lyman, "you know, that first round, it's a matter of getting people to remember to move, and do what they need to do. Hopefully, with most of these folks, one ticket is enough, and we'll have more compliance from here on out."
 In addition to obeying city ordinances, Lyman also has another requests for motorists driving on city streets as city plows are out and about.

On the face of it, CashFusion’s approach seems misguided, as earlier unequal amount mixing schemes like Blockchain’s SharedCoin were broken years ago. But the crucial difference, Lundeberg and Fyookball now believe, is that a CashFusion transaction would include more inputs and outputs than a SharedCoin transaction did. Similar to other nonintuitive mathematical quirks like the birthday problem, the number of potential configurations grows exponentially for each added input and output, solving the problem SharedCoin had — though Lundeberg agrees better math proofs will be necessary to properly confirm this.

The United States and Iran have said they do not want war, but fears have grown that the crisis could spin out of Tehran's or Washington's control. Tensions have careened from one crisis to another since President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers.
 The U.S. drone strike that killed Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani and a senior Iraqi militia leader in Baghdad on Jan. 3 was seen as a major provocation.
 The killing alarmed even Washington's allies in the Gulf, with Saudi Arabia dispatching Deputy Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman to Washington right after with a message to de-escalate.
 Iran retaliated days later, firing a barrage of missiles at two military bases in Iraq where U.S. troops are stationed. No casualties were reported in that attack and Iranian commanders say their intention was not to kill. Amid the confusion and fears of U.S. retaliation, Iran acknowledged it had unintentionally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet after takeoff from the Iranian capital, Tehran, killing all 176 people on board.
 In Iran on Sunday, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said that it was "a very sensitive time for the region."
 "The only solution to these crises is first de-escalation from all, and dialog is the only solution to these crises," he said during a joint press appearance with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.
 Rouhani said "the escalation of tensions in the region are not beneficial to the region and the world."
 The emir's visit to Iran was one of many diplomatic forays aimed at calming regional tensions and keeping back channels open.
 Iran sent its foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to Oman on Sunday to be among the first to offer condolences in person to the new ruler of Oman. The sultanate, like Qatar, is a close U.S. ally, but also maintains good relations with Iran. Oman helped facilitate talks between the U.S. and Iran under President Barack Obama.
 Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Saudi Arabia on Sunday as part of a tour of oil-producing Gulf Arab states. Stability in the Persian Gulf is a national security priority for Japan, which imports nearly 90 percent of its oil from the Middle East. Much of that is shipped from Arab Gulf states through the narrow Straight of Hormuz, which Iran partly controls.
 Abe next visited the United Arab Emirates on Monday for a meeting with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, before traveling to Oman Tuesday to meet Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said.
 Japanese energy supplies were a target of rising tensions in June when two cargo ships were hit off the Gulf of Oman. The attacks took place when Abe was in Iran seeking to backstep American tensions.
 Japanese media reported that Abe was told by Saudi leaders there on Sunday that they fully support Tokyo's plans to deploy naval forces, a destroyer and two patrol airplanes off the coasts of Yemen and Oman to help protect Japanese energy supplies.
 "A military conflict in the Middle East would have a huge impact on global peace and stability," Abe was quoted in Japan's The Mainichi daily as saying to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. "I'd like to ask all countries concerned to respond (to the situation) in a restrained manner."
 Meanwhile, Iran hosted Syrian Prime Minster Imad Khamis on Monday. A day earlier Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Qureshi was in Iran where he emphasized the importance of "maximum restraint and immediate steps for de- escalation by all sides," according to a statement by his office. War is in nobody's interest and issues must be resolved through dialog and diplomacy, the statement added.
 He is headed next to Saudi Arabia for meetings Monday. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has before attempted the difficult task of mediating between Iran and the U.S., as well as between arch-rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia.
 In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper told CBS "Face the Nation" that the U.S. is willing to meet with Iran's leadership without preconditions. Iranian officials, however, say no meetings can take place without U.S. economic sanctions being lifted first.
 There are rumblings that renewed domestic pressure on Iran could force it to negotiate with Washington. Thousands of Iranians are taking part in angry streets protests over the downing of the jetliner whose majority of passengers were Iranian nationals. Iranian officials admitted responsibility for shooting down the jet after initial denials by leaders.
 The demonstrations are demanding accountability and change in Iran. Deadly protests in November already shook the country, triggered by price hikes and economic woes from U.S. sanctions.
 In a tweet about the protests and whether they might pressure Iran's leadership to change its tone, Trump wrote: "Actually, I couldn't care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but, no nuclear weapons and "don't kill your protesters.""
 In Tehran, government spokesman Ali Rabiei gave a glimpse into how Iran's leadership views any possible dialog with Trump. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he said if Iran opens dialog with the United States, it would signal that pressure on Iran works and could lead to more pressure.
 "They give us messages, such as they have nothing to do with others and want to talk to us directly. We have no trust in them," he said, describing Trump as "untrustworthy."
 "He thinks that by putting ordinary people under pressure, he can achieve what he wants and can force us to retreat," Rabiei said.

Should the _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ baddie himself sprung out of prison, then it’s a pretty good bet that Keaton will be back in a cameo capacity.

But on its own terms, the deal seemed to be doing what it was supposed to do. The IAEA repeatedly confirmed that Iran was complying with all of its obligations, meaning there was no serious risk for the time being of Iran moving toward a bomb. And the US and the international community began lifting some of their sanctions on Iran and — very slowly — looking to do business with Iran once again.
