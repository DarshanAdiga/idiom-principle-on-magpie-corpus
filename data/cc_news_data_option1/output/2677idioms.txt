Loeffler is facing scrutiny in part because of a letter she wrote, obtained by CNN and first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and ESPN, that warned the WNBA that "to subscribe to a particular political agenda undermines the potential of the sport and sends a message of exclusion."
 Loeffler co-owns the Dream, Atlanta's WNBA franchise, and is the wealthiest member of the Senate. Earlier this year, Loeffler came under fire for stock trades made before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered the economy.
 The WNBA intentionally distanced itself from the senator Tuesday, saying, "Sen. Kelly Loeffler has not served as a Governor of the Atlanta Dream since October 2019 and is no longer involved in the day-to-day business of the team."
 When asked for comment, a Dream spokesperson sent CNN a statement saying, "The Atlanta Dream is not a political entity -- we are in the business of sports and entertainment. The Dream players and staff are focused on building a successful team on the court, winning games and creating a second-to-none fan experience."
 Loeffler's letter came after the WNBA announced its plan to display "Black Lives Matter" prominently on its basketball courts. The league's players also plan to wear warmup shirts with the words "Black Lives Matter" displayed on the front and "Say Her Name" on the back, alongside Breonna Taylor's name.
 Former Atlanta Dream and University of Louisville player Angel McCoughtry spearheaded the campaign.
 In her letter, Loeffler urged WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert to cancel these plans, instead putting American flags on all uniforms and apparel. Loeffler, a staunch Trump supporter, is facing an intense reelection campaign against fellow Republican Doug Collins this November.
 Former players and members of the WNBA Players Association immediately called for Loeffler's removal.
 Layshia Clarendon, a former Atlanta Dream player and member of the league's newly created Social Justice Council, shared her disgust with Loeffler on Twitter, writing, "I can't believe I ever stepped foot in Kelly's house and shared a meal with her. It's actually really hurtful to see her true colors. I had no idea while I played for ATL she felt this way. Happy to own us as long as we stay quiet and perform."
 Loeffler's office did not respond to CNN at the time of this article's publication. Tuesday afternoon, though, she tweeted: "@WNBA should stand for and unite around the American Flag -- not divisive political movements like BLM that unapologetically seek to defund the police."
 The WNBA is planning for a 22-game regular season to start in late July.

‚ÄúAfter months of risk, workers have suffered significant health consequences from COVID-19. Since the risk they face is not over, the additional compensation they deserve in light of that risk must continue as a matter of fairness,‚Äù Looney said. ‚ÄúStop & Shop has reported sales increases during the COVID-19 pandemic; the least it can do is support the employees who risked themselves and their families to keep the doors open.‚Äù
 Duff, D-Norwalk, said Stop & Shop employees ‚Äúdeserve true hazard pay while they continue to risk exposure to COVID-19. It‚Äôs clear the company labeled its program ‚Äòappreciation pay‚Äô so it could end the pay increases as soon as the coast was clear, even as the virus clearly has not disappeared.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDespite the fact that rising COVID-19 infections in more than 60 percent of the country represent a continued threat to our communities, Stop & Shop opted to end this pay program employees deserve ‚Äî and over a holiday weekend spurring high sales, to boot,‚Äù Duff said, ‚ÄúThe hazard and risk of COVID-19 is not over, and Stop & Shop should share its financial gains with the employees who ensured it could achieve them.‚Äù

United Airlines will send layoff warnings to 36,000 employees--nearly half its US staff--in the clearest signal yet of how deeply the pandemic is hurting the airline industry. The outlook for a recovery in air travel has dimmed in just the past two weeks with rising infection rates in much of the US causing some states to impose new quarantine requirements. United officials said Wednesday that they still hope to limit the number of October layoffs by offering early retirement, and that the 36,000 number is a worst-case scenario, the AP reports. The notices being sent to employees this month are meant to comply with a 60-day warning ahead of mass job cuts.
