In 2019, the Steelers ranked first in sacks, first in takeaways, fifth in points allowed, and fifth in yards allowed. The numbers improved as the season progressed, by and large, particularly after they acquired Fitzpatrick, so in Pittsburgh’s case in particular, using weighted DVOA really does make sense to get a more accurate look at where they are.

Susie was the first true love of my life. She was sweet of disposition, incredibly smart, affectionate, enthusiastic, eager to please. She was everything I could have ever wanted. We enjoyed taking long walks together, even in the rain. We especially enjoyed special moments of petting. I’ll admit, without shame, to us sleeping together. The other members of my family thought Susie belonged to all of us. Wrong, she was mine, she was my dog, a pure breed toy fox terrier that Dad brought home one afternoon. My parents were dog people. We still are dog people. Dogs make people better people, surely less selfish and less self-preoccupied. I’ll comment sometime about cat people.
 I’ve had other loves since, each one special in their own way. Earthquake (named after Earthquake McGoon from the musical, ‘Li’l Abner’) was my brazen, mischievous, non-neutered companion. A terrier/collie mix, he could hop on hind legs for yards trying to track birds. Earthquake once owned Princeton Theological Seminary, for he marked every administrator’s office. At our first church, he’d take advantage of us trying to hustle the kids from the car and bolt for a frolic. I’d run down the sidewalk, shouting: “Earthquake, Earthquake!” The townsfolk found that amusing.
 Zoe came next but she really was the kid’s best friend because Zoe was a dumb and happy-go-lucky black Labrador, enjoying chasing chipmunks, eating chipmunks, vaulting into Lake Chillisquaque and playing with spraying hoses. After Zoe, my wife presented me with our current dog, Bailey, a high maintenance Irish Jack Russell. He’s all momma’s boy. Safe on momma’s lap. Him most content alongside momma on the couch. Once a lonely and scared little puppy in a cage. Flyswatters frighten Bailey. Tuck tail and hide.
 Show me any dog and I can tell you about the character of the owner. Frankly, I’m inclined to trust dog people sooner than non-dog people. Anybody who is dedicated to caring for a dog, willing to be responsible for feeding a dog, taking the dog out for walkies, picking up their poop, letting them make you look silly, is all right in my book. If a dog approves of you, you get a gold star in heaven.
 You want a scared, cowering, snarling dog? Brutality will do the trick. You get snarling dogs when you beat them to obey master’s authority. Using brutality to establish dominance cannot produce a friendly dog. You want loyal, loving, tail-wagging dogs? Reject domination. Treat them with loyalty, love, kindly discipline, consistent goodness. You reward them. You give them reason to respect you, to want to please you. Good boy!

Under any circumstances, a great season by an NFL team requires that a lot of things go right, and a big part of that is always having key players stay healthy. Rare is it that any team can lose more than a couple of significant players due to injury in the middle of the season and still come out on top, especially if one of those players is your quarterback.
