The people of Mussoorie are particularly well-informed, because we are dependent on educational institutions with their access to the latest advances in knowledge, as well as on renewed influxes of tourists who are eager to show that they are at the forefront of the latest fads and fashions from all over India. In response to this, our canny snack-stall owners created our famed omelette dhabas patronised by ‘daring’ youth from vegetarian families eager to show that they have the courage to break the chains of convention! Many of our fringe-of-town wayside shack owners cater to more uninhibited expressions of social behaviour, but then our age has accepted live-in partnerships as an essential part of 21st century mores so who has the gall to cast the first stone?

The irony is that Seaver would have cringed at so many elements of the Mets’ comeback win over the Yankees, which improved the Mets to 17-21 and pulled them within 1 1/2 games of a wild card spot, and the subsequent stops & starts of their playoff “push.”

Taylor was killed when the police officers executed the drug search warrant and her boyfriend allegedly fired a first shot fearing the entrants were burglars. The shot prompted the four police officers to unleash a hail of bullets on the house, hitting Taylor eight times.
 The killing of the 26-year-old African American medical technician was initially overshadowed by the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic that began to sweep the country around the same time. Activists, celebrities and demonstrators have since made it a point to keep her name in the news cycle and call for justice over her death.
 Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced last week that the city will pay $12 million to Taylor's family as part of a settlement for her death.

With all that, the last thing Boustead wanted was “typical movie music.”
 Recorded live with the local Lakeshore Rush classical ensemble, the 2019 ″Dreaming Grand Avenue” scoring sessions gathered together six players supplying a canny blend of piano, flute, clarinet, violin, cello and percussion. Boustead’s music suffuses the film in a suspended dream state, leaning into the otherworldly qualities when required, affirming the ultimate optimism of the lovers, and their city, when the story supports it.
 “It’s quite extraordinary, to be asked to write 45 minutes of music from scratch,” Boustead told me. The creative partnerships of “Dreaming Grand Avenue,” he said, relied on what he now sees as a fruitful push/pull process, with the composer pushing for an unapologetically chamber ensemble vibe, while branching out into more conventional dramatic cues.

 “I had so many conversations with Hugh: How seriously are you taking the concept of good and evil in this film? How seriously should I take it as a composer? Those were really interesting conversations,” Boustead reflected. “Sometimes I had to dial it back a bit, but we all wanted to make sure the audience could still buy into the story."
 Now splitting his time between New York and Chicago (though this year, he has mainly stayed put in New York), Boustead is an ardent champion and practitioner of contemporary classic music-making. His program “Relevant Tones” ran on Classical WFMT for several years; now it’s a live-stream podcast. His umbrella organization Access Contemporary Music oversees both the Thirsty Ears and the Sound of Silent festivals, plus other projects.
 Years ago, Boustead collaborated with Strawdog Theatre Company on an evening of Ben Hecht stories taken from “1001 Nights in Chicago,” which later became a 30-minute film. Rick Kogan wrote about it for the Tribune.) After the film adaptation’s completion, Boustead participated in a panel moderated by Newcity editor and publisher Brian Hieggelke.

Since the start of this persistent, destructive entity known as 2020, so many of us have been craving films and film scores that mean something.
 The right film music takes us back into memories of a time before this one, reminding us that we’ll be all right. (We think, and hope.) It can scare us, reassure us, get our blood flowing. It expresses our emotional lives writ large, and sometimes small. Film music can unlock the secret heart of a story, moment by moment, and then it can live on afterward, for decades.
