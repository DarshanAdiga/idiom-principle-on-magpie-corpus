Butts County Fire Chief Mike Wilson said out in the county, there were a few trees down, but no major accidents due to the storm.
 Zeta made landfall Wednesday afternoon as a Category 2 hurricane, flailing the Louisiana coast with 110 mph winds. It weakened to a tropical storm by the time it reached Georgia.
 Across north Georgia, nearly one million residents were left in the dark after the storm passed through between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. Wind gusts in the metro Atlanta area peaked at 51 mph, with the highest wind gust recorded at 55 mph in Rome in northwest Georgia.
 Across metro Atlanta, fallen trees and downed wires have blocked interstates, disabled traffic signals and shut down surface streets.
 One person was reportedly killed when a tree fell on his mobile home in Cherokee County. There were also several reports of injuries from fallen trees in other areas.

Racism is very real to me. After feeling pretty pissed off I reconciled that we are all in a process of learning, hence giving birth to this platform on GAY TIMES, Unity Talks. What if we faced the issues that social media doesn’t allow us to discuss freely because it pits us in opposition, and instead shared information and experiences so we can learn from each other? As a community builder I’m used to doing this in real life and I know how powerful these spaces can be.

FRANKLIN -- The Historic Commission recently announced that the Franklin Historical Museum, 80 West Central St., will be open again weekly from 1-4 p.m. on Sundays, starting this weekend.
 The museum features a new and improved gift shop, featuring new items unique to Franklin.
 This year the museum is offering two new holiday ornaments: One depicting the Ray Memorial Library and the other featuring the downtown water trough in Clark Square. Ornaments are selling for $18 each.
 Other items added to the gift shop are hometown candles, pillows, mugs and more. The gift shop is run by the Friends of the Franklin Historical Museum. Profits go toward supporting museum programs.      Because of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, those visiting the museum will be required to wear masks. Guests will provide their name and contact information upon entering to allow for contact tracing if needed. There is a building occupancy capacity, so visitors are asked to be patient in the event the museum reaches its capacity.
 Patrons will be able to look, read and observe, but will not be allowed to touch items in the museum for safety, and will be required to maintain social distancing. The research library will be temporarily closed to the public, and the museum is putting a hold on physical donations.      Officials say the museum's limited schedule and COVID-19 protocols are a necessary, but temporary, arrangement. It is hoped that its popular Second Sunday Speaker Series will return at some point early next year.
 Museum workers have been measuring, cutting and hammering behind the scenes at the museum on the installation of a new Franklin exhibit. More details will be publicized later with an opening date for the exhibit to be announced.      Follow the Franklin Historical Museum on Facebook and Instagram. Look for the museum's Trivia Tuesdays on the second Tuesday of each month on Instagram.
 The museum is compliant with the American Disabilities Act and admission is always free. Donations are accepted.

 One of the many interesting encounters I had in Bihar was with Aditya Mohan, who started the Mithila Student Union (MSU) in Darbhanga and its surrounding areas a few years ago. The organisation started with the aim of getting the academic session at the Lalit Narayan Mithila University to start on time. From that, the MSU has grown into an organisation that works in panchayats in Darbhanga and surrounding areas and has also, this time round, put up around 12 candidates extolling ‘Mithilawaad’, the hyperlocal interests of Mithila. The party has no symbol at the moment but the issues are to do with the establishment of an AIIMS in Darbhanga, an airport to be sanctioned for the area and, of course, academic sessions to start and finish on time with examinations. The group is in no hurry to be a big political force as members feel the future of politics is going their way; that caste and identity on their own are not going to be enough to win an election; that delivery on aspirations (not just roads and foodgrain) will be the way. Much of the poll rhetoric on job creation by the mainstream parties reflected this trend.
 Encounters such as this show me that faith in democracy is alive and kicking, and identity politics is taking another turn in its evolution. Bihar, again, is showing the way in Indian politics.
 This election that I covered with masks, sanitisers, and a diary full of numbers of contacts in Patna from whom to cadge home-cooked meals and private sanitised vehicles, had lessons to offer me yet again, other than just trying to be safe while doing my job.

Tous les établissements de santé français doivent déclencher "sans attendre" leur plan blanc et déprogrammer des activités médicales "afin de libérer de la disponibilité en lits" pour les malades du Covid, indique le ministre de la Santé, Olivier Véran, dans un courrier consulté jeudi par l'AFP.
 Face aux "risques de saturation" dans certains territoires, "il devient nécessaire d'augmenter plus fortement les possibilités de prise en charge de patients" infectés par le coronavirus, écrit M. Véran dans cette lettre adressée mercredi aux directeurs d'hôpitaux.
 Le ministre leur demande donc de "déclencher sans attendre, pour tous les établissements ne l'ayant pas encore fait, les premiers paliers de déprogrammation" et de vérifier "la mise en oeuvre effective" de ces reports.
 Dans les régions "les plus en tension", il enjoint aux établissements de santé "d'activer sans attendre les paliers plus élevés, en déprogrammant toutes les activités chirurgicales et médicales pouvant l'être".
 Ces mesures devront toutefois préserver la prise en charge des cancers, des greffes, des malades chroniques "requérant des soins urgents", ainsi que la psychiatrie, "notamment les publics mineurs avec handicap psychique".
 L'objectif est d'"atteindre le plus rapidement possible les capacités maximales" en lits de réanimation. Leur nombre, déjà relevé de 5.100 à 5.800 après la première vague épidémique, était monté à 6.400 en début de semaine et devrait bientôt dépasser 7.000, a précisé M. Véran jeudi matin sur France Info.
 Le président de la République, Emmanuel Macron, avait annoncé mercredi soir que les capacités de réanimation seraient augmentées à 10.000 lits.
 "L'armement de lits supplémentaires" dans toutes les régions vise aussi à "assurer une solidarité des territoires par le transferts de patients", ajoute M. Véran dans son courrier.
 Selon le ministère de la Santé, au moins 27 malades ont déjà été évacués par avion du sud-est vers l'ouest du pays.
 Par ailleurs, pour garantir les renforts nécessaires, "les étudiants en santé peuvent être mobilisés", quitte à mettre "en suspens partiellement ou totalement leurs formations".
 Dans un autre courrier envoyé aux médecins libéraux, le ministre indique avoir décidé de "rendre à nouveau possibles les téléconsultations par téléphone pour certains patients", comme c'était le cas entre mars et juillet.

The Don’t Go Nuts brand was started in 2012 by the Pinto Family, and was one of the first truly and comprehensively nut free food manufacturing facilities in the United States.
 DGN quickly established a reputation in the marketplace for its food safety, taste and dedication to its tree-nut-free process, according to the letter, and also within this community for not only being a great place for locals to work and grow, but a brand that always made it a priority to support and give back to the community.
 The Salida facility has 17 employees. It was being leased from John Diesslin.
 “The company is a family affair, with husband and wife teams working together and all around emphasis on family first,” Myranda Goehl, production specialist said. “Working on a concrete floor for 10 hours a day, you become very close with your co-workers.”
 The company’s production also increased greatly over the years.
 “We went from producing a few hundred pounds of food to being able to efficiently and safely run over 4,000 pounds of snack bars and over 7,500 pounds of soy spread in one production run,” Goehl said.
 It was even able to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “We put safety protocols in place that not only allowed us to not skip a beat during the COVID-19 pandemic but continually celebrated a safety record with no injury in our facility in 793 days (as of Oct. 23),” Goehl said.
 “The employees at Pinto Barn see a need for local manufacturing in this valley beyond Pinto Barn Manufacturing. They hope to bring their world class production experience to local businesses that have bottling and packaging needs in the near future.”
 McNaught ended his letter by expressing gratitude.
 “The Pinto Barn Board of Directors wishes to sincerely thank all of our dedicated employees, customers, local and regional investors for all of their hard work and dedication to get this brand to this point in its journey, and know that you will all continue to support us as we successfully develop and grow,” McNaught said.

 ## Expansion plans
 According to Eby J. Jose, chairman of the K.R.

The app enables the farmers to list their produce along with phone number while for buyers, it gives a view of available produce, sorted by their geographical proximity to the farmers.
 Meanwhile, the makers of the app are also exploring options to augment the service by providing the current prices of commodities in trade, demand for listed products, and weather and seasonal changes, to help farmers plan better.

Bihar is the first State to have Assembly polls in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing with it not just the challenge of holding socially distant and safe polling, but also robust media coverage.
 Covering elections — which necessarily means engaging with the wisdom of crowds — during a pandemic comes with many challenges. The first casualty for me was the act of loitering, that simple joy of shooting the breeze with your fellow man, preferably at a tea stall on the highway, or engaging in a politically charged debate. Much of that was curtailed as I followed very strict SOPs with regard to COVID-19. However, that did not stop me from venturing deep into rural areas to chase stories that had captured the country’s sympathy and imagination over the last few months — stories that were more than just the stacking of caste arithmetic and were about issues such as the flight of migrants from host States back home to Bihar; the constituency of women voters, so assiduously courted by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar; and angry voices on prohibition. “Yeh _chunaav 80% jaat ka pinjara main hai, 20% feelings par_ (this poll is 80% in a cage of caste arithmetic, 20% on feelings),” said a senior leader acknowledging that issues like prohibition and events following the lockdown weighed in on the usual caste discourse, if only, in his assessment, a mere 20%.
 My travels into sparsely populated interior villages gave important pointers on how politics is to pan out in the rest of India for the next few years, on hyperlocal aspirations, and the mutation of identity politics 30 years after ‘Mandal’ and ‘Mandir’.
 One of the many interesting encounters I had in Bihar was with Aditya Mohan, who started the Mithila Student Union (MSU) in Darbhanga and its surrounding areas a few years ago. The organisation started with the aim of getting the academic session at the Lalit Narayan Mithila University to start on time. From that, the MSU has grown into an organisation that works in panchayats in Darbhanga and surrounding areas and has also, this time round, put up around 12 candidates extolling ‘Mithilawaad’, the hyperlocal interests of Mithila. The party has no symbol at the moment but the issues are to do with the establishment of an AIIMS in Darbhanga, an airport to be sanctioned for the area and, of course, academic sessions to start and finish on time with examinations.

VALPARAISO — The discovery Wednesday that a judge and staff members tested positive for COVID-19 has caused a disruption in business at the downtown courthouse just as operations were getting back on track in the wake of the county's first jury trial since the pandemic struck earlier this year.
 Porter Circuit Court Judge Mary DeBoer confirmed for The Times on Wednesday she learned just that day she and staff members tested positive for the coronavirus, thus shutting down operations in her courtroom through at least next week.
 The courtrooms of Porter Superior Court Judges Roger Bradford and David Chidester report they will be shut down as a precaution through at least the end of next week as well.

At a time when most ministerial engagements and even summits are taking place virtually, the significance of two senior U.S. officials travelling to Delhi a week before the U.S. goes to the polls conveys an unambiguous political message — the defence partnership has come of age.
 ## A long road
 It has been a long process, with many ups and downs since the first modest steps were taken with the end of the Cold War three decades ago. The 1991 Kicklighter proposals (Lt. Gen. Claude Kicklighter was the Army commander at the U.S. Pacific Command) suggested establishing contacts between the three Services to promote exchanges and explore areas of cooperation.
