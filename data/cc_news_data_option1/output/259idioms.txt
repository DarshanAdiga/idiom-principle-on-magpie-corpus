CRESTVIEW -- For nearly a year, Cassie Faulk had been homeless, camping in the woods despite her numerous disabilities. Faulk, now in her 30s, suffered a stroke at 15, which left her unable to communicate clearly.
   
 She was quickly victimized by other transients.
   
 "They took her money, left her high and dry, sucked her into doing drugs," said Gina Kirkland, manager for the Crestview Area Shelter for the Homeless.
   
 Faulk had gotten clean on her own, but was still living in the woods when Kirkland found her.
   
 "We were able to get her out of the tent," she recalled. "She hadn't eaten in four days. 'Get in my car,' I told her. 'We're going to McDonalds and we're going to get you something to eat.' "
   
 At the shelter, workers collected the funds to get Faulk to a cousin's friend in Texas, but she didn't want to leave because her baby's ashes were still in the woods where she'd been living. She didn't tell the shelter workers about what or when it happened, but they knew they needed to help.
   
 Kirkland went out to the camp where Faulk had been staying, but a woman there told her the ashes were locked up and she didn't know where the key was.
   
 Kirkland contacted the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office and asked for help.
   
 The Sheriff's Office rallied behind the cause, sending Deputy Joshua Hamilton to help. After going to the camp several times, he was able to get the small leather pouch that contained the infant's cremated remains.
   
 He brought them to Kirkland's home on a Sunday morning. She gathered up folks at the shelter and presented them to Faulk.
   
 "It was a real touching moment," Kirkland said. "She cried. I did, too."
   
 Now Faulk is in Texas, starting physical therapy to help regain some use of the parts of her body damaged by the long-ago stroke.
   
 She wasn't able to articulate exactly how she felt about getting her baby back, but Kirkland knew how much it meant.
   
 "I just could tell in her face," she said. "She said, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you.' "

Having fulfilled its long-pending promise of negating Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has said that the next objective for the party is to ensure the return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley.
 Large sections of the 400,000-strong Pandit community were forced to leave Kashmir in January 1990 following terror attacks and a secessionist movement spearheaded by extremist groups. Only a handful of Pandits live in the Valley now.
 BJP's national general secretary and in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir, Ram Madhav, said the transformation of the region after the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union terrirtories was underway and the process of return of Pandits to the Valley will begin only after consultations with the community leadership.
 Madhav, who was seen as the architect of an unlikely alliance between the BJP and the Peoples Democratic Party that formed the government in the state in 2015, said his party was committed to the return of Pandits with "honour and security".
 "What the Kashmiri Pandits had to face in the last three decades is a very unfortunate phase, but the whole state of Jammu and Kashmir also passed through a similar phase for the last seven decades. Now, major transformation is happening and we are sure that this transformation will help all sections, including the Pandits," he said. The BJP-PDP alliance broke in 2018 and the government fell shortly after.
 While a section of KPs are demanding a separate homeland within the Valley, other community leaders have expressed apprehension about the plans for their resettlement, citing security concerns.
 "When the BJP-PDP government was in power, it had initiated dialogue with the Pandit leadership with a view to explore ways for their return to the Valley. At that time, after two rounds of discussion, it was broadly decided that townships for them will be built in four or five locations across the Valley," he said.
 "No decision was arrived at on whether these would be exclusive or mixed townships, in any case the views of the Pandits would ultimately prevail," he added.
 But community organisations had a lukewarm response. "No consultations have been held with us; and even if they had come to us with the idea of staggered townships, we would have rejected it. We want single-place resettlement," said Agnishekhar, a member of Panun Kashmir, an organisation of Pandits that demands a separate homeland.

Monday's celebrations comes on the heels of TSU announcing it would receive part of $255 million in federal money from the FUTURE Act that was passed in December 2019.
 "We take students from any background, any assistance track, any location and we make them scholars," said TSU President Dr. Glenda Glover.
 Glover stressed the importance of education in the black community to continue King's work.
 The FUTURE Act will give historically black colleges and universities, or HBCU's, including TSU and other minority-serving schools around the country, money annually.
 In a statement sent to News4 regarding the act, Glover said ‚ÄúThe FUTURE Act legislation is a game changer for TSU, and the university is thankful to our Tennessee leadership of Senator Lamar Alexander, Representative Jim Cooper, Congressional Black Caucus members and others for their guidance to ensure the bill passed through both chambers."
 Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who was there for TSU's MLK Day Convocation, said he's glad to see the federal money helping these important schools in our state.
 "Historically black colleges and universities in this city and state are very important part of the institutions of higher learning in our state so we have supported them and will continue to do that," said Lee.

SPRINGFIELD -- Illinois' chief fiscal officer announced a plan last week to remedy the "ridiculous" law that allows legislators to be paid for days they did not hold office.
 Representatives and senators are paid in 12 equal disbursements on the last working day of each month. Current law allows lawmakers to receive a full salary as long as they hold office at least one day in each pay period.
 Comptroller Susana Mendoza proposed prorating legislators' pay, ensuring they are paid for only the days they hold office. She also wants to shift their salary schedule to be the same as it is for other state officials and employees -- twice monthly.
 Her legislative partner on the initiative, Elgin Democratic Sen. Cristina Castro, said the change would bring the legislative branch in line with the private sector.
 "This is a glaring loophole that has been exploited far too many times at the taxpayers' expense, and I'm sick of it. It needs to be closed," Castro said in a news release.
 The bill appears to have bipartisan support. Republican Rep. Mike Murphy, of Springfield, proposed a near-identical measure 12 months ago. The initiatives differ in one respect -- when they take effect. Murphy's bill would become enforceable immediately; the Democrats' plan would begin at the start of the 102nd General Assembly in January 2021.
 Altering lawmakers' pay during terms for which they are elected is unconstitutional, a spokesperson for Mendoza said, which is why her measure's effective date is later.
 Murphy said he sent a letter to Mendoza and Castro asking for their support on his bill and offering to help ensure the initiative, in whatever form, is successful this legislative session.
 The bottom line, Murphy said, "is let's just get this done," no matter whose name is on the final version.
 "We have got to do whatever we can to get the trust back of the people, and we have to earn it," he added. "Bills like this show that we're serious about doing the right thing."
 A spokesperson for Mendoza said the resignations of former Chicago Democrats Sen. Martin Sandoval and Rep. Luis Arroyo, both "egregious examples," indicate the need for a statutory change.
 Sandoval, whose Capitol office and home were raided by federal agents, announced on Nov. 27 he would resign his position to avoid "distraction to the important work that needs to be accomplished." His last day as a state lawmaker was Jan. 1.
 Arroyo was arrested on federal bribery charges in late October but waited until Nov. 1 -- the same day a special investigative panel was to consider whether to expel him from the chamber -- to officially resign.
 Because both former legislators held office for one day, they were paid the full month's salary in accordance with state law, according to the comptroller's office.
 In some instances, a legislator's replacement would get paid for the same full month's work as the retired or resigned official.
 "That's ridiculous. I can think of no other enterprise that pays for an ex- employee for work they never performed," Mendoza said in a news release. "Each of these lawmakers left under a cloud but stayed just long enough -- the first of the month -- to collect an 'exit bonus' from state taxpayers for a month's pay for no work."
 The initiative is one Castro said the newly-formed ethics reform commission will consider as part of its recommended ethics overhaul legislative package.
 In an interview in November, Murphy said his bill was one of about 30 proposed by Republicans and not addressed by the General Assembly during the fall veto session.
 His measure is House Bill 818 -- it has eight co-sponsors, all Republicans. Castro's measure will be Senate Bill 2456 when it is formally read into the record.

I wish you could see this country now and the progress we continue to make. From government officials, celebrities, CEO‚Äôs, influencers and so on, there is representation of every ethnicity. The truth is that while the civil rights movement in our minds seems so long ago, it was not. My generation‚Äôs grandparents grew up during that time and some parents were even born into it.
 There are times when I have sat in the kitchen with my grandparents listening to them tell a story about a time when my small, loving hometown in South Texas was separated by color. Where my grandpa had to walk on one side of the street and couldn‚Äôt have access to certain things. My grandmother, although Hispanic, was a much lighter color and often mistaken for being white, had more freedom than my grandpa. My mother, born just three years after the end of the civil rights movement, tells me times when growing up or being my age, she experienced a lot more racism and prejudices than now.
 The harsh reality is this was the way the world was not so long ago at all‚Äîseparated by color of whether you were black, brown, or white. I, myself, have experienced a bit of racism here and there but I know where we are now, is not where we were and not where we will be forever.
 Some may say this country is still divided and still an example of racism and maybe in our selfish human nature, there always will be a sense of it. However, the progress we have made is illuminating. In full transparency, there are still many issues that need attention and need fixing. There are certain aspects that are still unjust, but the country is still evolving and working towards fixing these issues. I am not invalidating any experiences or being na√Øve to issues currently happening; I am just here to say that for those issues, I am sorry and that there still is a brighter future that awaits.
 There will always be people who turn a blind eye to the issues regarding racism that a country faces, but there are also people who see things for what they are who will do their best to change it. Whether that‚Äôs through peaceful social movements or just showing love and compassion to another, ‚Äúhate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.‚Äù I‚Äôd like to imagine where we will be in twenty years, even closer as a nation than now and further away from the lingering separation that still sits in some people‚Äôs minds.

HOPKINTON -- Lobbyists for big tobacco companies routinely contact Shaun McAuliffe whenever "tobacco" appears in the printed agenda for an upcoming Hopkinton Board of Health meeting.
 "It happens all the time," said McAuliffe, the town's health director.
 Representatives from the likes of Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are known to attend a board meeting to make their presence known when the town discusses ways to limit tobacco sales because of health risks from smoking. And, representatives for convenience store giant Cumberland Farms are also known to show up, because, according to McAuliffe, it's one of the largest tobacco sellers in the region, especially when it comes to the vast number of smokes for sale at its gas stations.
 "Some of this is intimidation," McAuliffe said of the visits by lobbyists.
 Those representatives could be back in Hopkinton on Feb. 10 when the Board of Health holds a public hearing on proposed regulations to limit the number of tobacco licenses.
 The regulations would permanently retire a license when a Hopkinton business stops selling tobacco or closes. The idea is fewer licenses translate to less access to tobacco, thereby lowering the risk that local youngsters will puff a cigarette.
 "(Smoking tobacco) is not a social norm we're looking to condone," said McAuliffe.
 Some MetroWest communities have already limited tobacco licenses.
 Five years ago, Natick set a license cap at 27, and the number has steadily decreased to 22 after adopting the two conditions Hopkinton's health board is considering. The only exception is when a shop owner moves into a location that had a tobacco license. In that case, the new owner has 60 days to apply to assume the license.
 Keeping tobacco out of young people's hands was the primary reason for the regulations, said Natick Public Health Director Jim White.
 "Tobacco use is one of, if not the biggest risk factor to public health, and is preventable," White said in an email to the Daily News.
 Hopkinton's move to limit tobacco licenses come as the rate of cigarette smoking is falling in MetroWest high schools. Of the 25,000 students in grades 9-12 that took the 2018 MetroWest Adolescent Health Survey, 12% said they smoked cigarettes in their lifetime, compared to 35% in 2006. Those who currently smoke fell to 3%, compared to 15% in 2006.
 While smoking rates fell, students using electronic cigarettes rose sharply. Some public health officials say the development created a new generation of smokers addicted to nicotine.
 McAuliffe acknowledged the use of e-cigarettes has been a major problem at Hopkinton High School. Approximately 20% of students at the school tried vaping, according to the adolescent health survey.
 Hopkinton isn't alone when it comes to the prevalence of e-cigarettes.
 From 2016 to 2018, high school students in MetroWest who used e-cigarettes jumped from 28% to 41%, according to the survey. Those who used them in the 30 days immediately preceding the survey jumped from 15% to 28%.
 Massachusetts is cracking down on e-cigarettes and flavored tobacco products after reports of lung illnesses, and deaths, connected to vaping. Starting June 1, flavored nicotine vaping products can only be sold, and used, in licensed smoking bars. The same applies to all flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, chews and cigars.
 Last year, Framingham's Board of Health voted to limit the number of tobacco licenses to 30, including 26 regular licenses and 4 adult-only tobacco permits.
 Currently, roughly 60 establishments sell tobacco in Framingham, said Sam Wong, the city's public health director, because many were issued a license before the cap. When those businesses decide to no longer sell tobacco or go out of business, their licenses will be retired until the city reaches the 30 cap.
 Nine Hopkinton businesses have a tobacco license, and the number could drop to eight because McAuliffe said one downtown store that sells tobacco products could close.
 There's been no resistance from businesses to the Board of Health's move to limit tobacco licenses in Hopkinton, McAuliffe said.      A "significant number" of death certificates in town last year indicated the cause was cardiac problems and lung disease, he said. McAuliffe believes many of those who died began smoking cigarettes in the 1950s and 1960s.
 He doesn't want to see the same outcome for the town's youth.
 "The last thing (the board) wants is populations of students addicted to nicotine," McAuliffe said.

I have some advice for those at the State House: Try to get a grip! It is wise to learn from the mistakes of others rather than repeat them, thinking you will get a better outcome.
 Rhode Island already has the highest energy costs in New England. Germany, with the highest energy costs in the European Union, has blackouts because alternative energy cannot meet the demand for power. The infrastructure and technology to fulfill the "green" dreams is not in place and will not be for some time.
 Rhode Island does not have the installed infrastructure robustness nor capacity to reliably supply its own energy needs. Nor will the technology and infrastructure be in place any time soon. In fact, most of Rhode Island's installed infrastructure is very old.
 The lead time to replace a large utility transformer from a reliable supplier is about two-plus years! One major failure to an aged key substation or generator step-up transformer would put a world of hurt on the citizens of Rhode Island.
 Is there any sound reason for adopting the governor's promised "100% alternative energy" policy, which would dramatically raise the cost of energy to the most vulnerable of Rhode Island's citizens?
 Instead of this, Rhode Island and the other New England states should be suing New York for restraint of interstate commerce by preventing the pipeline transport of abundant natural gas from Pennsylvania to New England.

Sete lideran√ßas alvejadas
 Entre suspeitas de conflitos territoriais, desentendimento com fac√ßoes criminosas e homicidios ainda nao resolvidos, sete lideran√ßas foram mortas em 2019. A primeira morte do ano ocorreu no dia 27 de fevereiro de 2019, em conflito da comunidade Urucaia, em Manaus (AM), quando o Cacique Francisco de Souza Pereira (58), da etnia Tukano, foi morto a tiros por homens encapuzados na propria casa. A motiva√ßao do crime e desconhecida, mas a Delegacia Especializada em Homicidios e Sequestros (DEHS) trabalha com duas linhas de investiga√ßao, sendo a primeira que o lider de 42 aldeias foi morto pelo seu posicionamento contra o trafico de drogas na regiao, e a segunda, que ele pode ter sido alvejado por conflito na distribui√ßao de terreno.
 Quase quatro meses depois, em 13 de junho de 2019, tambem na cidade de Manaus (AM), o Cacique Willames Machado Alencar, da etnia Mura, foi morto aos 42 anos no conflito da comunidade Cemiterio dos √çndios. Conhecido como 'On√ßa Preta', o indigena foi assassinado com cinco tiros na invasao do local. Na ocasiao, o lider estava se arrumando para ir a uma audiencia publica na Assembleia Legislativa do Amazonas (ALE), na zona centro-sul da capital, quando o crime ocorreu. Segundo testemunhas, o cacique era constantemente amea√ßado por criminosos no local.
 Pouco tempo depois, em 22 de julho de 2019, Emyra Wajapi, lider da etnia Waiapi, foi morto aos 69 anos no conflito da terra indigena Wajapi/Aldeia Mariry, em Pedra Branca do Amapari (AP). Os lideres da aldeia afirmaram que a execu√ßao ocorreu durante uma invasao de garimpeiros na regiao, contudo, o Ministerio Publico Federal (MPF) arquivou o inquerito que investigava o ato. Segundo a investiga√ßao da Policia Federal (PF), a morte foi acidental. Emyra foi encontrado perto de um rio com diversas perfura√ßoes no corpo.

National flags should represent everyone from their country. They appear everywhere in everyday life, including at poignant events such as national celebrations and commemorations.

 Learning that Taiwan‚Äôs flag prominently displays the emblem of one of its political parties was a confusing and jarring experience.
 How can this be acceptable? Of course, there are complex historical and political reasons why this is the case.
 However, more efforts should have been made around the dawn of Taiwanese democracy to put forward a new, apolitical design to help usher in the new era of freedom. This was a missed opportunity, and forging another will be difficult, as making a change would require bipartisan consensus, and it is simply not in the KMT‚Äôs interest to have its emblem removed from the national flag.

Governors' budget proposals often land with a pronounced thud in the General Assembly. Legislators, who craft the final state budget, usually discard a great deal of what a governor proposes.
 But, even by those standards, Gov. Gina Raimondo's $10.2-billion spending plan got a chilly reception last week. There was a reason. It was based on wishful thinking, and left the legislature with hard decisions about how to trim the government.
 Already, the state is grappling with a budget deficit of almost $200 million. The governor would paper over that amount, and spend more on new programs, though fanciful revenue projections and tax hikes and fee increases that seem hopeful at best, given that the legislators who would have to enact them are up for reelection this fall.
 For example, the governor projected that she would collect $20 million in the new budget year by having the state operate recreational marijuana stores. This followed loud, clear warnings by legislative leaders that they would not entertain legalizing marijuana in this session (see "Rising challenges for legalized pot," editorial, Jan. 5). The state has been unable to regulate medical marijuana properly, never mind recreational, they noted.
 So that's $20 million more in cuts the legislature must find.
 She proposed slowing the phaseout of the state's onerous car tax, though House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello has made it crystal clear that ending the car tax is a top priority and that he will not tamper with it. "We must keep our promise we made to our constituents and taxpayers," Mr. Mattiello said.
 The governor surely knew that would be his response. So that's more spending to be cut.
 "[O]ther local aid reductions are very troubling and will have grave consequences for some of our cities and towns," the speaker added.
 More cuts elsewhere.
 A proposal to fund more lower-income housing by doubling the transfer tax on sales of buildings worth more than $500,000 could run into strong headwinds in the Assembly. A proposed tax hike on high-technology companies seems destined to face opposition since it could threaten the state's hopes of growing this vital sector of the economy.
 The governor proposed raising wine and hard liquor sales taxes that were reduced to make stores more competitive with those in Massachusetts. She proposed deep cuts for the state's already financially struggling hospitals. She proposed politically radioactive schemes for extracting more money from veterans living at the state Veterans Home, in part seizing the estates of residents who die without wills.
 All this is going on as Rhode Island is growing its state government at an alarming pace -- almost 33 percent since 2013. Indeed, the governor's proposed budget is the first to soar past $10 billion.
 While there are no broad-based taxes in the budget, the money comes from somewhere: namely from the citizens and businesses trying to make a go of it in Rhode Island. There are limits to what they will spend before they seek their fortunes elsewhere. Indeed, the state's high taxes and poor business climate are already a big reason Rhode Island's population growth has been sluggish, which is expected to cost the state a seat in Congress.
 It seems clear the legislature, in the months ahead, will face a challenging and politically dicey task of devising a state budget that can make ends meet, since the governor's attempt didn't really do that.

The weirdest part is that Senate Republicans have argued repeatedly, and correctly, that impeachment is a political process. That's why McConnell's admission that he's not impartial as a juror isn't disqualifying. Schumer's not impartial either! There's not even an impartial judge at the trial to rule on evidentiary matters: It's the Senate, via a majority vote, that decides on whether and which witnesses are called, not John Roberts. Politics dictates the process and politics will dictate the result. We're all big boys and girls who understand that -- _except_ when Trump allies like Dershowitz start looking for ways to get him off the hook. Suddenly what qualifies as a "high crime or misdemeanor" becomes a highly legalistic analysis about "criminal- like conduct." In reality a high crime or misdemeanor is whatever a supermajority of the electorate deems it to be. If Trump did something so terrible that a wide majority of the public supported ousting him immediately for it, he'd be in trouble right now. But they don't, so he isn't. _Impeachment is a political process._

However, head coach Grant McCann has always used the caveat that ‚Äúmoney talks‚Äù and while he has not said so publicly, it is thought Bowen is keen to join Premier League Newcastle if the opportunity arises.
 City have offered him a new contract which would reportedly double his wages, and quadruple them were Hull promoted. If he does not sign it, they will trigger an extra 12 months to his current deal, which expires in the summer, but he will rapidly lose value.
 Under Mike Ashley‚Äôs ownership, Newcastle have been notorious for not budging from their valuations on players. Bruce wanted Bowen last summer, but the Magpies were unwilling to pay ¬£20m and that stance has not changed. They see his valuation as nearer ¬£12m.
 They need more goals in the second half of the season with Joelinton and Allan Saint-Maximin having only scored one Premier League goal each. The third member of their attacking triumvirate, Miguel Almiron, broke his duck in December, 11 months after joining, and has now scored four goals in all competitions, two in the league.

Having fulfilled its long-pending promise of negating Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has said that the next objective for the party is to ensure the return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley.Large sections of the 400,000-strong Pandit community were forced to leave Kashmir in January 1990 following terror attacks and a secessionist movement spearheaded by extremist groups. Only a handful of Pandits live in the Valley now.BJP's national general secretary and in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir, Ram Madhav, said the transformation of the region after the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union terrirtories was underway and the process of return of Pandits to the Valley will begin only after consultations with the community leadership.Madhav, who was seen as the architect of an unlikely alliance between the BJP and the Peoples Democratic Party that formed the government in the state in 2015, said his party was committed to the return of Pandits with "honour and security". "What the Kashmiri Pandits had to face in the last three decades is a very unfortunate phase, but the whole state of Jammu and Kashmir also passed through a similar phase for the last seven decades. Now, major transformation is happening and we are sure that this transformation will help all sections, including the Pandits," he said. The BJP-PDP alliance broke in 2018 and the government fell shortly after.While a section of KPs are demanding a separate homeland within the Valley, other community leaders have expressed apprehension about the plans for their resettlement, citing security concerns."When the BJP-PDP government was in power, it had initiated dialogue with the Pandit leadership with a view to explore ways for their return to the Valley. At that time, after two rounds of discussion, it was broadly decided that townships for them will be built in four or five locations across the Valley," he said."No decision was arrived at on whether these would be exclusive or mixed townships, in any case the views of the Pandits would ultimately prevail," he added. But community organisations had a lukewarm response. "No consultations have been held with us; and even if they had come to us with the idea of staggered townships, we would have rejected it. We want single-place resettlement," said Agnishekhar, a member of Panun Kashmir, an organisation of Pandits that demands a separate homeland.

Sunday's night's Totally '80s with The Motels tour only drew about 300 fans to the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, but they were certainly among the most excited and satisfied 300 people we have seen at any concert recently, thoroughly thrilled to be hearing the iconic New Wave rock band some four decades after their heyday.
 Singer Martha Davis noted that this tour celebrates the 40th anniversary of the band's "Careful" album, and by coincidence, Sunday was also Davis' 69th birthday. About midway through the Motels' 14-song set, her road crew and the musicians from the other two bands on this tour surprised her with a big cake, dotted with about a dozen candles. Like just about everything else the headliners did, that led to a prolonged ovation with loud and sustained cheers. At one point early in the set, Davis stepped away from the mike to collect herself as the audience roared its approval for the previous song and she finally said "You guys are so good. You are going to make me cry."
 The Motels went through several formations and re-formations over the years, but their peak years were 1978-87, when their punky power pop fit perfectly into the MTV generation's concept of the New Wave of rock. The Berkeley, Calif., band hit the charts in a big way with 1982's "Only the Lonely," which hit number nine on the Top 100 singles, and the album it came from spawned three more hits that reached into the Top 100. By that time, band upheaval led to the later album being mostly populated by studio session musicians, but 1983's "Little Robbers" album produced another big hit in "Suddenly Last Summer," which helped propel the album itself to the top ranks of the charts. But the band couldn't stay together and Davis went on to record at least five solo albums after the band fell apart in 1987.
 After their breakup, fans didn't see a latter-day reunion, until 'The Motels featuring Martha Davis appeared in 1998 and they've been rocking fairly steadily since then. In 2013, the billing was changed a bit to Martha Davis and the Motels, and the current lineup includes Eric Gardner on drums, Clint Walsh on guitar, Nick Johns on bass, and Marty Jourard (from the '78-87 lineup) on keyboards and saxophone.
 The Motels shifted some songs around in their setlist on this show, opening with the throbbing rock beat of "Danger," and then shifting easily into the stylized mid-tempo cool of "So L.A." with its stop-and-start rhythmic twists. A quick definition of New Wave might be that it simply took punk rock's primal energy and refined it a bit, still reveling in raw emotion and innovative lyrical forays, but crafting it in much more musical frameworks and with a real effort to juice the dancefloor. And within a couple of songs Sunday night it was obvious The Motels could be poster children for that style.
 The very visceral, heavy power pop of "Mission of Mercy" really had some of the former '80s scenesters in the crowd going bonkers and at its conclusion the small crowd was indeed roaring like a throng several times its size. Jourard's keyboards gave "Suddenly, Last Summer" its smooth melodic pull, while the rhythm section added some grit, and Davis' vocal melded soul with her pop instincts.
 Starting the night in a black jacket over a red sweater, Davis had her hair scrunched up under a ballcap, but perhaps a third of the way through the show, she tossed the cap aside and her unruly mop of hair punctuated the rest of the concert, bouncing around as she danced and sang. The darker breakup song "Take the L" had a more thumping beat, while "Closets and Bullets" displayed the band's punky origins.
 That cake appeared as Davis was preparing to sing "Careful," title cut of that 1980 album, a mid-tempo rock ballad. There was a heavier rock feel to "Party Professional," verging on metal, until Jourard's sax solo brought it all home in a blistering finish. "Cry Baby" was another signature type tune, a fast punk-rock charge done with skill and refinement, as if The Ramones had enrolled at Berklee College of Music for a semester or two.
 "We got to slow it down here," Davis said, catching her breath after that. "I know 69 sounds fun, but I've got to rest every so often." But that change of pace proved to be one of the night's highlights, as her vocal on the ballad "Total Control" was her most evocative, full of soul and nuance. The Motels put out a new album last year and Davis noted "Light Me Up" was from it, a slower number that ramped up to a sizzling midtempo finish - pleasant but unremarkable. The heavy duty pulsating rhythms of "Tipping Point" proved much more effective and "Only the Lonely" with its sensuous come-on tone was a killer even before the crowd began singing along perfectly.
 Another number from last year's album ended the Motels' 65-minute set, and "The Last Few Beautiful Days" was surely memorable, beginning like a French cabaret song with just Jourard's piano and Davis (paging Edith Piaf!), before the band reappeared and it all burst out into full-tilt rocker. Squalling guitar and Jourard's sax filtered through electronic samples and polyrhythms made for a blazing finish that neatly skirted chaos to provide one more rockin' thrill.
 British band Bow Wow Wow were fellow '80s New Wavers, although a bit more controversial than the Motels. Created by Malcolm McLaren, the notorious producer behind the Sex Pistols, Bow Wow Wow was formed from former members of the Adam and the Ants band, but with Annabella Lwin as lead singer. When they formed in 1980, Lwin was all of 13, and when the following year their second album featured a photo of her nude on the cover, the ... um ... controversy hit the fan. Nonetheless Bow Wow Wow had some really intriguing rhythmic innovations, basically African tribal rhythms onto punk rock/New Wave music. "Go Wild in the Country" was a big hit in the United Kingdom in 1982 and they had several more hits around the world, including their cover of "I Want Candy."
 These days, Bow Wow Wow''s singer is Kristen Dinsmore, and original bassist Leigh Gorman is joined by guitarist Eric Ferentinos, and drummer Christian Johnson. (Lwin still performs as 'Anabella's Bow Wow Wow.) Bow Wow Wow's 45-minute set was a shot of pure adrenaline, fired up in large part by Johnson's drumming, which relied heavily on twin tom toms, tuned to sound like kettle drums, which gave every song a healthy dose of that so-called Burundi beat that is the band's signature.
 "Do You Want to Hold Me?" got things off to a furious start, Dinsmore sprinting around the stage as she sang and the pounding drums turning the club into a heated dance mecca. Ferentinos sported a small Mohawk haircut, while Gorman and Johnson don't have to worry about that, both being completely bald. With that backing, the 30-ish Dinsmore was able to re-create some of that "little girl lost" quality that worked to such effective contrast in the original lineup and her energy and enthusiasm helped make it all work. "Baby Oh No!" was a wild trip through rhythmic fire and the room-shaking rhythms of "Jungle Boy" could not be denied.
 "Go Wild In The Country" combined cascading drum figures with punky sass, while the frenetic pace of "C3-C60-C90" (released as a cassette-only single, for those who can remember those things) threatened spontaneous combustion. Bow Wow Wow's treatment of "I Want Candy" really struck a chord, as it did way back when, for the way it grafted its wicked rhythmic fury onto the familiar pop song. The band's own "Mile High Club" used that formula for its own brand of exuberant power pop. Bow Wow Wow's sets ended with the fiery - what else? - careening dash through "What's the Time?" by which time Dinsmore had led the throng through an intense aerobic workout besides the concert.
 When In Rome II opened the night with a half-hour of their synth-pop, which we missed. That band, the first When in Rome, had one hit, 1988's "The Promise," which they performed Sunday night. The original lineup was a trio and When In Rome II includes keyboardist John Floreale from that original threesome, while the other two original members perform in Europe as When In Rome UK.

BOURNE -- As nip bottles continue to line the roadways of towns across Cape Cod and be consumed by motorists behind the wheel, one Bourne resident has decided it's time to consider banning the sale of the miniature packaged alcoholic beverages.
 "It will stop a lot of people from drinking on the road while they are in public, which would be the goal of this ban," Jeremey Canfield told the Board of Selectmen earlier this month.
 Most nip bottles contain hard alcohol, and Canfield says it can take as few as two nips to be legally intoxicated. He said he understands that liquor stores will be against the ban because nips make up part of their revenue, but he argues the ban would make the community much safer.
 The selectmen noted the ban also would help the environment by reducing trash on the side of the roadways.
 However, the problem is much larger than one town can solve, said Selectman James Potter, who added the path toward a solution should begin at the state level.
 "My sense of it, it's complex," said Judith Froman, the board's chairwoman. "It is litter and alcoholism and that culture."
 The question of whether or not to ban the 50-milliliter and 100-milliliter bottles of alcohol has been percolating throughout the Cape as well as at the state level.
 An act promoting the proper disposal of miniatures, sponsored by state Rep. Randy Hunt, R-Sandwich, will be heard by the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy on Wednesday morning at the State House.
 If passed, the bill would add nip bottles100 milliliters or less to the 5-cent deposit container law.
 The bill, which has failed to pass since it was originally introduced in January 2017, is finally gaining some momentum, Hunt said Friday.
 "People all around the state ... are paying more and more attention to this because, quite frankly, it is still out of control," he said.
 The problem first came to light when a constituent from East Sandwich reached out to him after he picked up trash in his neighborhood, Hunt said. The man told him he couldn't believe how many nips he picked up and asked the state representative if he could do something about it.
 Hunt thought it would be relatively easy to add the nip bottles to the list of containers that get a 5-cent deposit. Doing so would make them valuable for people to pick up and recycle.
 While Hunt admitted the bill won't stop anyone from throwing the nip bottle out the window, it would encourage people to pick them up off the ground.
 Some support the proposed bill but argue that it doesn't go far enough.
 "I would like to see a higher deposit than a nickel," said Neil Rhein, executive director of Keep Massachusetts Beautiful, who will testify in support of the bill in Boston on Wednesday.
 Rhein noted that a nickel today is not what it was worth 40 years ago when the bottle-recycling deposit was started. Although the deposit won't help solve the problem, it will certainly help, he said.
 Keep Massachusetts Beautiful, which has a branch on Cape Cod, conducts hundreds of clean-up events around the state each year. Rhein said nip bottles are always among the top five things people pick up at the events.
 "There are a lot of nickels sitting out there," Rhein said. "Some people will pick them up and cash in their haul."
 In terms of getting a full-on ban of nip bottles passed statewide, Hunt said everyone is looking to see what will happen in Chelsea, the only city or town in the state with such a ban. The ban is currently being challenged by package stores.
 "If they survive a court challenge, which is where I think it is going, then I do see plenty of other towns and cities taking this up," Hunt said.
 The Chelsea ban, which was implemented in August 2018, is being appealed to the state Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission by the city's package stores, Chelsea City Manager Tom Ambrosino said. For now, however, the stores are complying with it.
 Most government officials feel it was an appropriate measure by the city's Licensing Board to ban the 50-milliliter and 100-milliliter bottles, Ambrosino said.
 "People feel like it has made a little bit of a difference in litter and is one of the factors in reducing the public drunkenness we have been seeing," he said.
 The town of Mashpee is hoping to replicate what Chelsea has done by creating a bylaw of its own banning nip bottles from liquor stores, said Andrew Gottlieb, chairman of the Mashpee Board of Selectmen.
 The Board is the regulatory authority for liquor licenses in the town, which are renewed each year, Gottlieb said. But before moving forward with the proposed bylaw, the selectmen are discussing it with town counsel and are waiting to see what happens in Chelsea.
 In Eastham, a plastic and marine hazards reduction bylaw being proposed by the selectmen for the annual town meeting in May would ban the sale and distribution of certain single-use plastic items, including nips.
 A nip bottle ban was also part of a recent discussion by the Falmouth Board of Selectmen.
 Falmouth Selectwoman Susan Moran said there is concern over how nip bottles contribute to litter in town. But she said the issue can't be solved on a town-by-town basis. If only one community does something on the issue, then there is the argument that someone can go to a neighboring town to buy a nip, she said.
 "It would be great if all the communities got together and had the same ordinance, because that would have the best chance in cleaning up the problem," Moran said.
 On Thursday, a petition article was filed by Falmouth residents to create a bylaw that would prohibit the sale of alcoholic containers less than 100 milliliters, said Alan Robinson, a member of the Falmouth Litter Reduction Team and the Cape Cod Anti-Litter Coalition.
 The petition article comes after the Litter Reduction Team conducted 52 roadside surveys that counted the number of nip bottles, water bottles, beer cans, takeout food containers and more found on the side of the road. Robinson said about 32% of the litter were nip bottles.
 The Litter Reduction Team hopes to get other towns across the Cape on board with the ban as well, he said.
 Robinson, who also will testifyi in support of the bill Wednesday, said he hopes "there is enough fire that the state legislature moves on this."
