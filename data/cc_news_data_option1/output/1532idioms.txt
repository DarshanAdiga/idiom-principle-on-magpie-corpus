The 32-year-old will join Shenhua in January, the club said in a statement on its website.
 Chelsea confirmed in a statement that they had "agreed terms for the permanent transfer of Nicolas Anelka in the January transfer window."
 Shanghai, who finished 11th in the league last season, have also been linked with Didier Drogba, Anelka's team mate at the English Premier League side.
 Several Chinese clubs have reportedly contacted Ivory Coast international Drogba about a possible transfer. Last month Drogba refused a one-year extension to his contract at Chelsea and the 33-year-old's deal at the London club expires next year.
 Local media have reported that former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker Anelka's lucrative contract would involve both football and commercial cooperation.
 While the signing of Anelka may signal an upswing for the sport in the country, Chinese football has lurched from crisis to crisis in recent years and disaffected fans have turned away from the game amid corruption scandals, match-fixing and violence on and off the pitch.
 The national team has qualified for the World Cup finals only once when they played in the 2002 edition held in South Korea and Japan but lost all their group matches and failed to score a goal.
 In January, they exited the 16-team Asian Cup at the first hurdle after finishing third in their group behind Uzbekistan and hosts Qatar.
 Anelka scored 59 goals for Chelsea since arriving from Bolton Wanderers in January 2008.

GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) — Exequiel Lopez hoisted himself up in the air and spun around, first horizontally, then upside down, supporting himself with one arm. Ideally he’d be several feet in the air above a circus- tent crowd in some North Texas town, but on this hot Wednesday afternoon he settled for a shade tree in a vacant Grand Prairie parking lot, his aerial straps tied around a formidable branch. Lopez, originally from Argentina, is one of more than 40 members of the Cirque MonteCarlo circus troupe camped out in the deserted parking lot. The novel coronavirus outbreak and the government-mandated shutdowns that followed cut the circus tour season short just as it was beginning, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. Speaking in Spanish, Lopez said he must continue to perform and practice, even if it’s in a tree, just to stay busy. “That’s why we practice, you know. We want to keep it going, somehow, even if it’s just for us,” said Franchesca Cavallini, 23, whose expertise is hula hooping. “It definitely hurts.” Cirque MonteCarlo’s situation is one example of how life has screeched to a halt as the coronavirus spreads, leaving many questioning where their next paycheck will come from. Now, the circus performers are looking for a place to go and wondering when they’ll get back to work. A typical circus camp would be filled with excitement as the crew prepares the tent and performers ready their costumes. This camp is quiet. A few people mingle in a cafeteria trailer while a handful practice in the shade, but mostly folks stick to their trailers. To reduce the risk of exposing the troupe to the virus, only one or two people leave the camp for food or other supplies, so most of the troupe has not been outside the campsite in weeks. At night...

An unbiased analysts shows that the disproportionate fallout in the Western world relative to East Asia is overwhelmingly due to poor preparation – and had effective South Korean style measures been implemented from the outset America would have seen only a small fraction of the cases it currently suffers from.[17] Nevertheless, calls from the U.S. and to a lesser extent from within other Western states[18] to make China foot the bill are manifold. Scholars from the American Enterprise Institute and Stanford University’s Hoover Institution among others have made direct calls for Western states to unilaterally “seize the assets of Chinese state-owned companies,” cancel debts to China and expropriate Chinese overseas assets “in compensation for coronavirus losses.”[19] The Florida based firm the Berman Law Group has already filed two major lawsuits suing China calling for compensation for the outbreak – and the situation looks set to worsen considerably with many more suits to follow. Regarding how the crisis could play out, and how the U.S. could act on its massive claims against China over the virus which are expected to be in the hundreds of billions at least, there is an important precedent for American courts providing similar compensation to alleged victims of an East Asian government and the American state taking action accordingly – that of the Otto Warmbier case in 2018. Assessment of the Warmbier case sets a very important precedent with very considerable implications for the outcome of a Sino-American dispute.

"I have always asked myself why, when an agent is representing a player and he comes to negotiate his contract with the club, why is the club paying the agency fees?" Rosell said at a football conference in Dubai on Wednesday.
 "When he is defending the other party and what he wants is to get the maximum number for the other party and, at the end, you have to pay the commission to the agent, it doesn't make sense. This is something I would ask UEFA to change as a rule."
 Transfers are big business and agents' cuts can run into millions of dollars.
 The system has come in for much criticism, with FIFA, the world football governing body, announcing plans in September aimed at opening up the dealings to more transparency and capping the amount which agents can earn from transfers.
 While maintaining that agents were the responsibility of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, the general secretary of European football's governing body UEFA, had some sympathy for Rosell's position.
 "I also agree on who has to pay the agent - the player who uses the agent," Infantino said.
 "That seems quite obvious as well. If you go to the hairdressers, you don't send your employer to pay the bill," he added.

 Luis Enrique is reportedly keen on bringing the former Manchester City ace to Serie A, and is looking into signing him on loan for the remainder of the season with a view to a permanent move.
 "Roma are one of the biggest clubs in Europe and I would accept him wearing their shirt. I hope to have a meeting with Tottenham soon so we can clarify his future," said Corluka’s agent, Nikky Vuksan. _   _

With such a large number of poor, along with others too close for comfort, how will we be able to satisfy all the needs and wants?
 How the schools will be able to provide the education needed without a much better system has not been revealed and to be frank, we cannot wait until this COVID-19 virus debacle to be over before the school board and the superintendent think about it. They will, by law, get the money and lack of funds cannot be an excuse.
 To assume that we will get back to normal in a heartbeat is unrealistic, but then again, we Americans can do anything. One thing is certain, we cannot show the world that we are the best at complaining. We have the best County Commission ever and they will burn the midnight oil to come up with a plan to get us going again.
 As for the public, they (that’s you and me) will have to be patient, generous to a fault and charitable beyond normal. Our doctors and hospitals have met the challenge that a community such as ours needs and expects. They have to have more support if we are to continue to get the health care we need.
 Enough is never enough, so now is the time to dig in … be ready when the time comes to be first out of the box to make it all work. We must support our school board and superintendent, our commissioners and out local merchants, along with giving emotional support to those who need it, suffer some indignity and know that we live in the best country in the world and that is not going away anytime soon.

Just watching Elle Smith on her daily workout videos can make the viewer break out in a sweat, as the Blue Springs South sophomore is working hard to get back to the form that helped her play a key role in the Jaguars' 2018 softball state championship.
   
 She was the most talented "cheerleader" in the state when the Jags won their second consecutive Class 4 state championship in 2019 as a shoulder injury sidelined the left fielder for the entire season.
   
 "I hated to miss last season," Smith said, "but I was so proud of my girls and I was there every day, for games and practice. I didn't want to miss a thing."
   
 She recently had shoulder surgery for the torn labrum and hopes to be 100 percent when the Jaguars take the field this fall - barring any coronavirus setback - seeking a three-peat.
   
 However, unless you are a true South softball fan, you might not be aware of the role the then freshman left fielder played in that dramatic first state championship.
   
 In the Class 4 District 13 championship game against Suburban Big Six Conference opponent Lee's Summit North, the score was tied at 3-3 and the Broncos had runners on second and third with two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning.
   
 North's designated player Madison Burton, a left-handed batter, sliced a blooper to left field as the South faithful gasped.
   
 There seemed to be little chance Smith was going to catch that ball. But she dove and caught it, saving the Jaguars to win it later.
   
 "I'll be honest with you," Smith said. "I was thinking the ball was going to be hit to me - I really was - so I was so ready to make that catch.
   
 "But it was slicing away from me. I knew I could catch up with it, but I was afraid it might get knocked out of my glove when I hit the ground."
   
 So was coach Kristi Williams, who held her breath along with the rest of the Jaguars.
   
 "We knew she was going to get to it," Williams said then. "It was just a matter of if she was going to hold onto it."
   
 She got to the ball, and she did hold onto it.
   
 "I wanted to run out to left field and give her a hug after that catch," pitcher Easton Seib, now with Valparaiso University, said at the time. "We don't go to state without that catch. It was the play of the year! We all loved Elle and we really loved her after that catch."
   
 Smith, who stands 4-foot-11, stretched out her diminutive frame for all it was worth to make a catch that placed her in the annals of South softball lore.
   
 "I was like, 'Lord, please let me catch it,'" Smith said. "When I landed I was like, 'Whew!' It was an amazing experience."
   
 Looking back on the defensive gem of that season, Williams adds, "One thing I always say about Elle is that she does everything 100,000 miles per hour.
   
 "That is a play she makes every day in practice. She's going to go for that catch. That's what she does. And when we needed it the most, she delivered."
   
 Sophomore Tori Bradley then drove in the go-ahead run in the top of the eighth inning and Seib delivered a 1-2-3 bottom of the eighth to seal the 8-4 extra- inning win.
   
 "I think about that game all the time," Smith said, "especially since I couldn't play last season.
   
 "That's why I'm working so hard. I am so lucky, because my dad owns a gym, and while it's closed I'm still able to go in early each morning and work out. I even get a workout cleaning up when I'm done.
   
 "I want to come back better than I ever have been. I want to help our team win that third straight championship. We've won two in a row and winning three in a row would be incredible - and I want to be healthy to help make that happen."

The English Premier League side, with only three outfield players on the substitutes bench, won 4-0 at Shamrock Rovers but finished third in Group A, one point behind the Russians.
 Tottenham needed a win combined with a defeat for Rubin and had to make up a difference of five goals to qualify and, although it looked impossible to start with, it was on the cards at the break in the respective games.
 "At half-time we knew that the other team [Rubin] were losing and thought we had a real chance," Spurs manager Harry Redknaopp told ITV4. "We knew they had gone down to 10 men."
 Rubin fell behind to a Vierinha penalty in the 16th minute after their goalkeeper Sergei Ryzhikov was sent off for scything down Giorgos Georgiadis, while a second-string Tottenham side had opened up a three-goal half-time lead at Shamrock.
 But Paraguay forward Nelson Haedo Valdez sscored for Rubin three minutes after the break, volleying in from the penalty spot after Gokdeniz Karadeniz had cut the ball back.
 South Africa midfielder Steven Pienaar, with his first goal for Spurs, Andros Townsend and Jermain Defoe struck in a 16-minute spell before half-time to keep the Londoners in the hunt.
 Substitute Harry Kane then added the fourth in stoppage-time for Tottenham, who have fielded under-strength teams in all their group games.
 Shamrock's defeat in coach Michael O'Neill's last game in charge, ended a 12-match European campaign that began in mid-July and included progress to the third qualifying round of the Champions League where they lost to FC Copenhagen.
 That sent them into the Europa League play-off round where they surprisingly eliminated Partizan Belgrade, only to lose all six group games.
