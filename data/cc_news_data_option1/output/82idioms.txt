Aimee Gentry took over Orchards Day Nurseries after mother Laura died as a result of lupus in 2015. Laura had built the nursery from scratch, having started in Caxton in 1991.
 Orchards now has three sites - a nursery and preschool in Royston and a day nursery in Eaton Socon, Cambs.
 An inspector visited The Orchards Day Nursery in Kneesworth Street - which is run by manager Cheryl Jarman and deputy manager Gemma Emmett - at the end of last year and awarded the top mark - just as Aimee's mum had achieved in their previous inspection in 2013.
 The latest report stated: "Babies and children thrive and flourish at this homely, nurturing nursery. They receive consistently high-quality care and exciting, meaningful learning experiences.
 "Staff act as excellent role models for children. They are professional, kind and deeply committed to their role."
 The inspector highlighted strong partnerships with parents, staff promoting children's good health and safety, the calm atmosphere and effective safeguarding, among other positives.

CINCINNATI - The Reds on Monday signed Japanese outfielder Shogo Akiyama to a three-year, $21 million deal and will introduce the five-time Japanese All- Star at a news conference on Wednesday. The contract includes salaries of $6 million in 2020, $7 million in 2021 and $8 million in 2022.
 Akiyama, who will wear No. 4, becomes the first Japanese player in the 150-year history of the Reds, the last big league club to add a player from that nation. During the previous offseason, the organization added Pacific Rim scouting manager Rob Fidler and Pacific Rim scout Jamey Storvick, but has had its eye on Akiyama for even longer.
 "We scouted Shogo for several years in anticipation of his free agency," president of baseball operations Dick Williams said in a statement. "We like his approach at the plate as well as his outfield defense, and we think he will complement our team very well."

DALLAS -- The list of items Boeing could be forced to fix before federal safety officials let the grounded 737 Max airliner fly again has grown to include a problem with electrical wiring used for the plane's controls.
   
 Separately on Monday, the financial damage to Boeing from the airplane crisis came into sharper focus as American Airlines said it has reached agreement over compensation from the plane maker for thousands of flights it canceled because its Max jets were grounded most of the year.
   
 American did not say how much it will receive but said it will give $30 million to employees as profit-sharing. American estimated in October that the Max grounding would cost it $540 million in pretax income for all of 2019.
   
 Aeromexico said it too settled with Boeing but declined to release details. The airline has six Max jets.
   
 The wiring issue came to light after the Federal Aviation Administration asked Boeing to audit key systems on the Max after two crashes in which new software and faulty sensors were implicated. During that review of changes Boeing is making to the plane, Boeing discovered that bundles of electrical wiring were too close together and -- at least in theory -- raised the potential for a short circuit that could cause pilots to lose control of the plane.
   
 "We identified this wiring-bundle issue ‚Ä¶ and we are working with the FAA to perform the appropriate analysis," said Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe.
   
 The company said, however, it is too soon to know whether it will need to make any design changes, such as moving the wiring bundles farther apart. Boeing says it believes that other safeguards, including circuit breakers and insulation around the wiring, could be sufficient to prevent a short-circuit from leading to another crash.
   
 The discovery of the wiring issue was first reported by The New York Times.
   
 Boeing built and delivered nearly 400 Max jets to airlines before the plane was grounded in March after two crashes that killed 346 people. Since then, another 400 or so Max jets have rolled off the assembly line, although they can't be sent to airlines.
   
 Boeing engineers have finished changes to a key software system called MCAS that was activated by faulty sensors in each crash, firmly pushing the noses of the planes down, a condition called runaway stabilizer.
   
 The recent review of changes to the Max raised the question whether a wiring short circuit could also cause a runaway stabilizer.
   
 Boeing has been working for more than a year to fix MCAS, which was designed partly to prevent the plane from aerodynamic stalls that could cause it to fall from the sky. Boeing is making the system less powerful and linking it to two sensors instead of one for extra protection against the kind of sensor failures that occurred before the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
   
 Separately, in June FAA test pilots were able to cause a failure of flight computers on the Max during a simulator test.
   
 It is unclear when the Max will be cleared to fly. On Monday, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford repeated the agency's position that it has no timetable for reviewing the plane. He said the FAA and Boeing are analyzing findings from the recent review of Boeing's changes to the plane, and "the agency will ensure that all safety related issues identified during this process are addressed before the aircraft is approved for return to passenger service."
   
 The FAA has not yet decided whether to require that Max pilots train on flight simulators before carrying passengers. That would cause another long delay in the plane's return. For one thing, there are only a handful of Max simulators, while Southwest has nearly 10,000 pilots who fly the Max and other versions of the 737; American has 4,200.
   
 Southwest Airlines, which has 34 Max planes, the most of any carrier, announced last month that it reached a deal on partial compensation from Boeing and will share $125 million of the undisclosed amount with employees. United Airlines has not announced a settlement.
   
 Before the grounding, the Max was Boeing's best-selling plane, with nearly 5,000 unfilled orders. However, Boeing will stop production temporarily in mid-January, affecting about 3,000 employees in the Seattle area. On Monday, the company began notifying them whether they will move or change jobs. Boeing promises to avoid layoffs or furloughs.
   
 The crisis cost former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg his job. He was ousted last month and will be replaced next week by David Calhoun, a private-equity executive who once ran General Electric's jet-engine business and has served on Boeing's board since 2009, most recently as chairman.

Once outside, the pantry patrons can select whatever they want from the assortment of fruits and vegetables, including onions, chayotes, cherries, potatoes ‚Äî regular and sweet ‚Äî and kiwis. Pantry clients can receive groceries from CTLC once a month.
 Chris Ballard, CTLC director, was trying to convince people to take some packages of celery.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nature‚Äôs toothbrush,‚Äù she said.
 The market will be repeated Saturday when CTLC has its second food distribution day of the week. The food pantry is at 702 W. Ave. G in Temple.
 The produce comes from the Central Texas Food Bank out of Austin and loaded into the refrigerated trailer in the parking lot, which serves as a hub for other area food banks.
 There are some people in the community who will come by and pick up produce. On Tuesday, one lady drove by, having had some of the vegetables loaded into her truck.
 ‚ÄúShe takes the vegetables to her neighbors,‚Äù Ballard said.
 Ballard said she doesn‚Äôt like the fresh produce to wind up in the trash, so when the vegetables begin to brown around the edges, the food will be left at the back of the building for those who roam the area at night.
 In 2019, Churches Touching Lives for Christ distributed 3,857,890 pounds of food to thousands of families and individuals. In 2018, 2,855,160 pounds of food was distributed by CTLC.
 Each week, 770 children in 12 schools in six Bell County school districts, and in Teague, receive a bag full of food to take home for the weekend through the weekend nutrition program.
 Martha Tyroch manages the program and has recruited all of the volunteers who put the bags together.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an eclectic group back there doing that work,‚Äù Ballard said.
 It was discovered that some of the students were sharing their weekend food with friends. Now the bags are given to the bus drivers who distribute the bags as the students depart the bus.
 ‚ÄúAt least we now know the food is likely making it to the child‚Äôs home,‚Äù said Retha Snelson, board member and treasurer at CTLC.
 Jim Hornsby, director of CTLC for years, died in July and the food pantry continued on serving people in need without missing a beat, Snelson said.
 CTLC volunteers just continued doing what needed to be done, she said.
 Ballard said she‚Äôs the type of person who likes order, but that‚Äôs not how food and clothing ministries work.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something new every day,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou learn to be flexible.‚Äù
 There are truckers who will call as they are passing through, if they have a couple of pallets, more or less, of chicken parts or bottled water, or just about anything that wasn‚Äôt accepted for whatever reason by the distribution center scheduled to receive the items.
 The origin of a pallet of hot dogs may not match the order form of a food distribution center and be rejected. The trucker doesn‚Äôt want to carry those hot dogs back to the source and the manufacturer likely doesn‚Äôt want to pay for the return trip.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a network out there of truckers and businesses that know who to contact when there‚Äôs some extra food that can be distributed to area food pantries,‚Äù Snelson said.
 When the pantry was low on money, businesses and groups in the community came through with funding.
 One lesson Ballard said she has absorbed is that CTLC is located in an old building and there‚Äôs always something breaking or leaking or just malfunctioning.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure this is not new, Jim probably just took care of those issues on his own without burdening anybody else,‚Äù she said.
 The equipment that moves pallets on and off the trucks needs to be replaced and a couple of volunteers to drive them would be helpful.
 ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt do it,‚Äù Ballard said.
 However, Snelson can, when given enough space to maneuver, though she‚Äôd be willing to pass along that chore to someone else.
 CTLC was able to get Feed My Sheep designated as a pantry partner, so it can benefit from the Central Texas Food Bank food donations.
 Surprisingly, when there is a need, such as turkeys during the holiday or a deep freeze, someone usually walks in the door or telephones with just what is required.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre blessed and we‚Äôre doing good work,‚Äù Ballard said.
