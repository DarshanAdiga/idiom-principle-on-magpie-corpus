Apple is in final talks with Paramount Pictures to partner and produce director Martin Scorsese’s lavishly-mounted period thriller “Killers of the Flower Moon“.


  According to _The Hollywood Reporter_ , the development comes over a month after it was reported that the inflated budget of more than USD 150 million had led the veteran filmmaker to reach out to Apple, MGM and Netflix, which previously backed Scorsese’s last expensive film, “The Irishman”.


  Apple will be credited as the creative studio and shoulder the cost, while Paramount will distribute.


  “Killers of the Flower Moon” will feature the director’s favourite leading men, Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio.


  The film, based on David Grann’s historical book of the same name, is set in 1920s Oklahoma and centres around the Osage Nation murders, in which members of the Native American tribe were murdered one by one after the group became rich off the oil found underneath their land.


  As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case and uncovered a chilling conspiracy and one of the most monstrous crimes in the American history.


  Imperative Entertainment picked up the movie rights to Grann’s book in 2016 for USD 5 million.


  In 2018, Scorsese and DiCaprio came on board and one year later, Paramount acquired the project.


  As per a source, the studio had fixed the USD 150 million range for the film but the budget rose to USD 225 million.


  Paramount head Jim Gianopulos resisted, with the insider saying he was ready to allow the price tag to go up to USD 180 million.


  With DiCaprio being a USD 20 million per day earner, Scorsese in the same range and De Niro getting a USD 15 million by day, the involvement of the trio alone puts the ballooned budget at USD 55 million.


  With Paramount drawing the line, the director then turned to Netflix, personally reaching out to film head Scott Stuber.


  The streamer, according to a source, had quoted USD 215 million for the project.


  But that may not have been enough. MGM considered the project before Apple finally bought it.


  Scorsese undertook a rewrite by himself earlier this year, which is another reason why the price shot up. The adapted script was penned by veteran screenwriter Eric Roth, who has films like “Forrest Gump”, “Munich” and the upcoming “Dune” to his credit.


  The final numbers on the deal were not revealed.


  This is the second time that Scorsese has had trouble with making his film.


  His previous directorial, “The Irishman” was also set up at Paramount but due to its climbing cost, the film was sold to streamer Netflix.


  The Oscar-nominated crime drama cost more than USD 225 million, according to multiple sources, not the USD 160 million that has been widely reported.


  “Killers...” is the second deal for Apple after the recent acquisition of World War II submarine drama “Greyhound”, starring Tom Hanks. The streamer picked up the film from Sony.

UNT athletic director Wren Baker expressed confidence earlier this spring that there will be a college football season sometime this year.


  “I believe we will have a football season,” Baker said. “We will take until the end of June to figure out if we can start on time. I lean toward we will play a full season that will be delayed.”


  Confidence in the state of the season has grown since that time.


  Schools and conferences across the country have announced time frames for athletes returning to campus and resuming workouts.


  UNT shut down its athletic facilities, including the Mean Green Athletic Center, on March 17. The school suspended all team activities at the same time.


  The Pacific-12 Conference announced Tuesday that it will allow voluntary in- person workouts to begin on June 15. Clemson University will begin voluntary workouts on June 8, while the University of Oklahoma is waiting until July 1. UNT will soon follow with its own announcement.


  UNT officials recently took another step to prepare for the upcoming season by sending out a survey to members of the Mean Green Scholarship Fund.


  UNT asked fans if they would come back to Apogee Stadium for football games and if they would be willing to wear a mask at games, said Allen Powell, a UNT graduate and booster who filled out the survey.


  One of the questions several programs are dealing with in advance of the season is how to maintain social distancing in stadiums. UNT has established how it would handle that issue in its ticketing policy that prioritized season ticket holders and students.


  Apogee Stadium’s capacity is 30,850. The school has never sold out the venue and averaged 21,358 fans per game last season.


  Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith said last week that the school has looked at scenarios using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines on social distancing to examine how many fans could attend home games in the fall.


  Smith said those guidelines would allow about 20,000-22,000 fans in Ohio Stadium, a venue that seats nearly 105,000. He said that if those guidelines are relaxed, the venue could fit as many as 50,000.


  Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard announced Tuesday that the school would have to limit the capacity of Jack Trice Stadium to 50% under current guidelines.


  UNT has not yet addressed how many fans would fit in Apogee if social distancing is in place. Apogee Stadium was more than half full for each of the Mean Green’s home games last season.


  The school fell just short of a sellout when a season-high crowd of 30,123 showed up for a loss to Houston. The Mean Green still drew 16,094 fans for a win over Middle Tennessee — the lowest turnout of any UNT home game at Apogee last season.


  UNT could face a seating shortage for the first time since Apogee opened in 2011, depending on the social-distancing policies in place in just a few months.


  The school laid out guidelines to handle that potential problem this week as it prepared to unveil its plan for returning athletes to campus.

Professor Yuen Kwok-Yung, a leading infectious disease expert who headed up the hamster study, said during a news conference that this is some of the first good evidence that "we should all wear a mask" until a coronavirus treatment or a vaccine is available.


  "Remember, prevention is always better than a cure," he said.


  But others aren't quite convinced that draping a mask in front of a critter's cage 24/7 provides a good model for what people do, as they take their masks on and off throughout the course of the day whenever they eat, drink, or unlock their phone, touching them with their hands, and readjusting the fit.


  "It's hard to extrapolate from this hamster study to what these masks mean for humans," Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, told Insider.


  "It is a study that shows surgical masks can prevent droplet respiratory infections from spreading. I think that's basically what it shows. But that doesn't necessarily translate to a public policy prescription for the general public."

IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Last week, Samson Evans became the third scholarship running back in the last nine months to voluntarily leave the Iowa football program.


   


  The decision, though, should be viewed as a sign of the top-end strength in Derrick Foster's room -- not any dysfunction within it.


   


  While Foster correctly acknowledges the Hawkeyes' run-game production fell short of internal expectations in 2019 (90th in FBS at 3.95 yards per carry), there's no doubt the room is in its best shape in three seasons, buoyed by the emergence of Tyler Goodson.


   


  And Hawkeye fans should be comforted to hear that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Goodson has been bulking up in suburban Atlanta while working out with a personal trainer and Mercer-bound younger brother Taylor.


   


  Foster reports that Goodson's body weight is in the "198 to 200 pounds" range on his 5-foot-10 frame. He was between 190 and 195 last season as a true freshman. It's an incremental gain designed to improve Goodson's durability.


   


  "We felt like he had that frame to be able to do that and not lose any step, any speed," Foster said. "He's still got great quickness and great feet."


   


  We may one day look back on Minnesota week 2019 as the time when the Goodson era officially began. It was then -- after a maddening 24-22 loss at Wisconsin, in which the speedy Goodson had just six touches of the football -- that Brian Ferentz and the offensive staff made a change in the backfield.


   


  Goodson would become the featured back. Against Minnesota, which entered 9-0 and No. 7 in the country, Goodson would set the tone with first-quarter bursts of 26 and 21 yards, followed by a 10-yard touchdown run that demonstrated his quickness to the edge and power to carry a tackler into the end zone.


   


  Two games later, Goodson's 55-yard touchdown gallop at Nebraska pushed Iowa to an early 14-3 lead.


   


  It was obviously the right decision. Iowa went 4-0 with Goodson as the starter. He scored a touchdown in each of those games, including the 49-24 rout of USC in the Holiday Bowl.


   


  He got 65 carries in Iowa's final four games, compared with 17 for Mekhi Sargent and 10 for Toren Young -- who had been the team rushing leaders.


   


  "At the end of the day, the conversation was more so, 'Let's do what's best for us as a team,'" Foster said. "Not to discredit the other guys and (say) they're not best for the team, but we definitely wanted to put the best product, the best 11 guys out there that we felt like can get us started early.


   


  "And we felt Tyler could do that. And that's where he came into play. Then Mekhi and Toren did a great job supporting that role for him moving forward."


   


  Young has since given up his fifth year of eligibility, leaving Goodson (the first true freshman in program history to lead Iowa in rushing), Sargent (1,308 rushing yards in two seasons) and Ivory Kelly-Martin (the Week 1 starter in 2018) to lead Iowa's running backs into 2020. Sargent is uniquely placed in his native Key West, Florida -- quite the outpost amid the pandemic.


   


  Backup will come from redshirt freshman Shadrick Byrd of Alabama, plus incoming freshmen Gavin Williams from Des Moines and LeShon Williams of suburban Chicago. (Six running backs, honestly, feel about right.) Gavin Williams enrolled in January at Iowa, in part to get a taste of spring practice -- only to be sent back home in March to take online college classes.


   


  It's certainly been an interesting and unexpected time, including for Foster, 34, as he enters his third season with the Hawkeyes. While working from home more these days, he considers himself blessed to see his son take his first steps. Normally this time of year, he'd be out recruiting.


   


  And he should feel good about his position group, too, as Henry Geil (transfer to Independence Community College, of "Last Chance U." fame), Young (pro aspirations) and now Evans (transfer portal) have said good-bye.


   


  "To be honest, (Evans) was a surprise. But I totally respect and understand his wishes. He will do very well moving forward. He is a great kid and a great young man," Foster said. "You never want to see a guy leave.


   


  "But with the backs we have we have in the room … I feel really comfortable and really confident about things moving forward."

As Americans observe Memorial Day during this COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, it was another pandemic a century ago that was remembered Sunday.


   


  The Spanish flu, also known as the 1918 flu pandemic, occurred while World War I was still being fought. The pandemic was estimated to kill at least 50 million people worldwide and 675,000 in the U.S.


   


  Seventy-eight of the 135 World War I service members named on the wall of honor at Veterans Pointe Memorial at Duncan Park in Spartanburg died during the Spanish flu pandemic shortly after signing up to serve their country, Ed Hall of American Legion Post 28 said.


   


  "Not everybody on this wall died in combat," Wall told an estimated 40 people who attended Spartanburg's annual Memorial Day observance at Duncan Park. "But every one of them died representing the United States of America. They still gave their life for their country."


   


  Hall spoke of war atrocities, and how many whose names are etched in stone met their deaths.


   


  The 651 names on the wall represent all wars from World War I through the Iraq and Afghanistan wars of recent history, he said.


   


  They also represent all branches of service, with many from Spartanburg County averaging about 25 years old, he said.


   


  "A lot died in the Pacific Ocean and went down with their ships," he said. "We had people from Spartanburg County who died at Pearl Harbor."


   


  Among the highest death tolls were in the Army Air Corps flying bombing missions over Europe during World War II, he said.


   


  "They would get up and go on their missions, many of their buddies dying around them being shot down," he said. "They would come back to England, Italy or wherever their bases were and get ready to do it again the next day until they got their missions in.


   


  "In the early days of the war, it was impossible to complete 25 missions to get to go home and survive. In 1942 that was considered not possible. But they still got up every morning and they went on their missions. A lot of brave young men did that."


   


  Many Marines died during major battles against the Japanese in the Pacific campaign at Tarawa and Saipan, he said.


   


  "A lot of those people were from Spartanburg County," he said.


   


  After the three-month Battle of Bataan in the Philippines, during the brutal Bataan Death March in 1942, many captured U.S. soldiers died en route to the prisoner of war camp.


   


  "Many of those soldiers disappeared, went missing," Hall said. They were either beheaded, or many were required to dig their own graves -- hit on the head and killed by shovels.


   


  "The atrocities did not come out immediately. They came out in 1943, 44. It was actually suppressed by the government because they did not want to have people who had sons missing in action to think they might be exposed to that type of conditions.


   


  "It was not a good thing to be a prisoner of the Japanese, for sure."


   


  John Barron of VFW Post 9539 in Roebuck delivered a Missing in Action presentation, and said 81,900 U.S. service members from five wars are still unaccounted.


   


  Among those unaccounted are 77,597 from World War II; 7,589 from the Korean War; 1,587 from the Vietnam War; 126 from the Cold War; and six from Iraq and Afghanistan.


   


  "Seventy-five percent of the losses are in the Asian Pacific, and over 41,000 of the missing are presumed lost at sea," he said.


   


  Efforts by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency to account for every service member continue today, he said.


   


  Four previously unaccounted service members who died in the Korean War and World War II were recently identified, he said.


   


  "They are all dedicated to the single mission of finding and bringing our missing personnel home," he said of the government agency.


   


  Meanwhile, Hall asked everyone to remember the sacrifices made for their country.


   


  "These young men raised their hand, took their oath and they went to war to represent this country to the best of their ability," he said. "We need to remember them for that. We should never, ever, ever, ever forget them for their service to this country."

People may also be afraid to ride because of news reports from other cities, where bus drivers and other transit employees have become sick and died from coronavirus, Suarez said. But so far, no DCTA driver or operator has contracted the virus.


  The local spending reductions, in combination with the federal underwriting, could keep the agency in a strong position to bounce back when people are ready, the staff said.


  And to the surprise of board members, the agency may also be in a position to help its member cities (Denton, Highland Village and Lewisville) if sales tax revenue bounces back faster than ridership does.


  Board members agreed to dust off old revenue-sharing policies from back when DCTA was first founded but before the train was running. For a brief time, DCTA had excess sales tax revenue that it could devote to transportation projects in Denton, Highland Village and Lewisville. The revenue-sharing would be restricted to transit projects, but that could mean help with things that often get shelved in hard times, such as new sidewalks, bike lanes and more.


  Suarez cautioned that even though it will be hard to predict people’s behavior in the coming months, the agency also needs to pay close attention to what happens at the University of North Texas, Texas Woman’s University and North Central Texas College.


  A large percentage of the agency’s ridership — several million boardings each year on DCTA trains and buses — happens there. Thousands of students, faculty and staff travel to and from campus, and around Denton, the county and the region via DCTA buses and the A-train.


  “Let’s not peel service back so far that it defeats the purpose,” Suarez said.

El entrenador de la Selección Peruana espera que la Liga 1 se reanude la primera semana de julio sin mucha burocracia en la aprobación de los protocolos por parte de las autoridades gubernamentales. “Es necesario que esto comience cuanto antes, cumpliendo los protocolos que el ministerio de salud recomienda. Pero hay que ponerse en marcha lo antes posible. Lo importante es que no sea el 30 de junio el reinicio de los entrenamientos, tiene que ser la primera semana. Lo que necesitamos es que la primera semana de junio se reactive todo para que la primera semana de julio comience la Liga 1”, dijo en RPP. “Lo antes posible deben arrancar los entrenamientos. No soy un político ni mucho menos porque no entiendo y no me interesa, me interesa el fútbol y lo que hago yo. Esto no puede pasar de aprobación en aprobación. Sí, tiene que haber un control, pero tiene que aceptarse la vuelta al entrenamiento porque la condición de los jugadores se deteriora cada día más”, añadió preocupado. Ricardo Gareca dijo que el Perú no tiene que copiar a nadie, tiene que mirar su propia problemática. “No creo que haya que esperar a que alguien reaccione para reaccionar. Uno tiene que ver cuál es el dilema y qué tiene que resolver. En el Perú hay gente muy capacitada que puede otorgar soluciones y estar a la altura de esta situación”, afirmó. “Creo que ya ha pasado un tiempo más que prudencial de acatamiento no es que vas a hacer una desobediencia pero deben empezar a confiar y creer que la gente del fútbol estamos totalmente capacitados”, comentó el entrenador de la Selección Peruana. “Yo lo que digo es que ya son más de 70 días acatando las ordenes.

  Whether you support President Trump or not, his personality and actions invite satire. When he unveiled the official logo for _Space Force_ , a multi- billion dollar branch of the U.S. military, the internet was quick to poke fun and draw connections to _Star Trek_ ’s Starfleet insignia.


  Now, comedy television titans Greg Daniels and Steve Carell reunite after _The Office_ to base an entire series on this notion. Given the talent involved (including John Malkovich, Ben Schwartz and the late Fred Willard), the new Netflix show, naturally titled _Space Force,_ has all the caliber needed to set phasers to stun. However, too few stars align to launch an enterprise worth the trek.


  In the 10-episode debut season, Carell plays Mark Naird, a four-star general doing his best to churn the titular military branch into a flying example of success. No one seems to want to be a part of it or know what they’re doing. (Not far off from _The Office_ in that regard.) Thankfully, Malkovich’s scene- stealing advisor character, Dr. Adrian Mallory, is present to keep tabs on the situation and help steer the virtual ship in the right direction – even if he’s a bit exhausted by the whole idea. (Malkovich is 100 percent the sole reason to check this series out, if at all still curious.)

Dr. Joseph Warren peered down the hill. The entire city of Boston was teeming with Redcoats. I can not imagine what was going through his head. Or his heart….
   
 The fledging Provincial Congress had appointed him Major General just days before. When he'd reported for duty on this unseasonably warm morning of June 17, 1775, General Israel Putman and Colonel William Prescott both requested he take command.
   
 Dr. Warren declined, asking only where the fighting was to be the fiercest. They pointed him to Breed's Hill, a small outcropping in front of the higher, more pronounced Bunker Hill.
   
 The British soldiers were renowned the world over for their fighting abilities. They scoffed at the idea of a bunch of backwoods merchants and farmers standing up to them. And they sent the first wave directly up Breed's Hill to prove their point.
   
 Dr. Warren and his compatriots, to the astonishment of the British--and quite possibly even some of the defenders--repelled the attack. And the second one! But with ranks thinned and ammunition exhausted, there was no hope against a third charge.
   
 The rag tag band had made its point. There was nothing more to prove. They could melt back over the hill with honor….. But this fight wasn't about someone's dignity. Or honor. It was about their homes. Their livelihood. Their rights. Their posterity.
   
 The third and final wave rolled in with a vengeance. The desperate defenders threw rocks at them. They turned their long guns into clubs……
   
 Dr. Joseph Warren was just six days past his 34th birthday. He had a distinguished medical practice; four beautiful children; and a bright future that was as promising as any…..
   
 He was the quintessential American soldier before America became America!
   
 He didn't wave any banners or sing "Oh, say can you see." He didn't waste time on "Give me liberty or give me death" speeches. He didn't even get to say one single goodbye for goodness sakes.
   
 He fought with every ounce he had in his body like the very gates of Hell had been cast upon him. He didn't quit. He didn't give up. He didn't give an inch! And he didn't die in vain.
   
 We use the term Stand Up for America. Listen, Joseph Warren surpassed that by every measurable accounting--he laid face down in the dirt and mire and died for her!
   
 I'm telling you with all my heart today, this nation isn't worth a hoot in a whirlwind if we can't still hear Dr. Warren's silence from 245 years ago!!!
   
 That exact same silence was multiplied ten thousand fold in David Miller's twenty acre cornfield on a foggy September 17, 1862, morning. The mist rising from nearby Antietam creek obscured the first of Union General Joseph Hooker's troops to march through Miller's corn toward the Confederates "up by Dunker Church."
   
 The Rebels pushed the Yankees back across the field. But the Bluecoats rallied and pushed back. The Confederates were forced almost up to the Church when John Bell Hood and his Texas regiment rode to the rescue.
   
 The Union army retreated, only to rally again. The Rebels fell back, and then pushed back….
   
 I don't believe one soldier blinked that morning. They all had the Joseph Warren gene. They didn't need orders. Face them toward the enemy and get out of the way!
   
 It is believed by most historians, Miller's simple twenty acre cornfield exchanged hands as many as fifteen times in a five hour stretch. Here's one thing we know for certain, the Battle of Antietam is still the single bloodiest day of fighting ever in the annals of American warfare!
   
 Of the 22,500 plus casualties (dead, wounded or missing)--two thirds of them were found in or near the cornfield.
   
 There is one more report from so many official accounts, eyewitness and written statements from people directly involved that it cannot be disputed. By late afternoon, there was not a stalk of corn left standing…..and a person could walk from one end of David Miller's cornfield to the other…..without stepping on the ground…..
   
 That silence reverberates down though the Spanish-American War, World War's I and II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan…..
   
 I don't care if you call it Memorial Day, Decoration Day or confuse it with Veterans Day. Let's just for once in our lives be as hard headed, stubborn, loyal, brave, insistent, true, caring, giving and as loving as each of the heroes who gave their "last full measure" on our behalf.
   
 We must never stop hearing THEIR silence!
   
 Most Respectfully,
   
 Kes

I agree with the idea that WMR is better as a portable VR solution. It is something I discovered after pairing my Acer WMR headset with my Helios 300. I can sit in my small office for work, watching movies, or playing games that I can remain seated, then move the laptop to the living room for room scale experiences. WMR excels at portability. Tracing out a play area, without worrying about lighthouses, and being able to turn on and off the boundary are great features. Having one of those fancy backpack PC's gives you as much play area as you have floor space. Just something to consider. I gladly trade a little tracking accuracy for a much more portable experience.

June 9, 1937 —May 17, 2020


  GLOVERSVILLE — Mrs. Jacqueline Evona Aldous, age 82, of Gloversville, passed away Sunday, May 17, 2020 at Nathan Littauer Hospital, Gloversville.


  She was born June 9, 1937 in Cambridge, NY, the daughter of the late Harold and Natalie Henderson Beck. She was a 1955 graduate of Greenwich High School. She married Charles Aldous and resided in Saratoga Springs with their five children until 1968. The family then moved to Gloversville where she became very active in the community. Her children were her life as was apparent through her many activities such as Cub Scout den mother, Girl Scout cookie chairman, her very active role with the Gloversville Little League at Parkhurst Field where she ran the concession stand while watching her boys play ball for the next decade. She was an early pioneer in the renovation of the Glove Theatre spending many hours cleaning, preparing the theatre for opening night. Her family grew very quickly, not only to include five children, but also many grandchildren, and great grandchildren. Across the many generations, she never missed a concert, a ballgame, a gig, performance, Stonewall haunts, or live plays. You could always count on her being there for whatever or wherever any of her children or grandchildren were involved. She was her family’s biggest fan and you always knew she was there by the loudest “hoot” in the audience. She was also an active member of the neighborhood watch and the self-proclaimed mayor of Temple Street. She was known for her strong will, strong constitution, and her motto was “Everyone is entitled to my opinion.”, but no one was more caring or more generous to her family and her community than Jackie. She loved gardening and she loved to knit. She made beautiful hats, mittens, and sweaters that she gave away to those in need and you could find them displayed for sale at the Mohawk Harvest Coop. She worked as a marketing associate at Amsterdam Printing and Litho at the time of her retirement in 2005. She was an active Democrat and her only regret was that she didn’t live long enough to cast her vote in November to get Trump out of the White House.

Lewis R. Aronin passed away peacefully at his home in Lexington, MA on Thursday, May 21, 2020, at the age of 100 years and 9 months. He was born in Norwood, MA, son of the late Samuel Aronin & Celia Acoff Aronin. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 59 years Natalie Eleanor Wolfson Aronin, and his sister, Thelma B. Kopstein. He is survived by his two daughters, Marlene Sigel (Taylor) and Terry Dubow (Robert), three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Lewis graduated first in his class from Norwood HIgh School in 1936 and obtained a BS in Applied Physics from MIT in 1940. He then went to work for the Waltham Watch Company where he was a Research Engineer until 1949. He returned to MIT on the research staff of the MIT Metallurgical Project. In 1954 he published a significant paper on the effect of fast neutrons on materials and was elected to Sigma Xi on the basis of that paper. In 1958, a private company, Nuclear Metals, assumed the MIT Metallurgical Project and there Lewis became group leader of physical metallurgy and manager of metallurgical research until 1966. He also contributed two chapters to a text book on nuclear reactor fuel elements. When the company folded, Lewis became a consultant for Kennicott Copper Corporation Ledgmont Laboratory in Lexington, and later joined the Army Materials Technology Laboratory in Watertown, MA where he supervised programs on the development of advanced materials for ballistic missile defense interceptors until his retirement in 1990. A registered professional engineer, Lewis was a member of ASM and AIME, and is a charter member of the Boston chapter of SAMPE where he served as treasurer for 15 years and was made an honorary senior member for his service. He is also a Mason and is a Melvin Jones Fellow in the Lions Club, having been a member of the Lexington Lions Club since 1969. Most recently, Lewis had been a volunteer for MITs Age Lab. There he participated in the 85+ Lifestyle Leaders, a panel of community members over the age of 85 who meet to examine important issues of concern to an aging population.

Long-sought projects to bolster protection of the Cape and peninsula beaches are coming into view.
   
 A project to place emergency sand berms on all three beaches, including St. Joe Beach, should be ready to go out for bid by fall, said Warren Yeager, Assistant County Administrator.
   
 Meanwhile, work should begin next month on "vegetative islands" along the southern portion of Cape San Blas, Yeager said.
   
 The berm project has been pursued by the Board of County Commissioners since before Hurricane Michael.
   
 At the time of planning for a beach restoration project, engineers and the Department of Environmental Protection were examining offshore structures to alter the currents along St. Joseph Peninsula, considered the fastest-eroding shoreline in the state.
   
 But after Michael scooped up considerable beach, punching a hole in Eagle Harbor in the peninsula state park, county officials have urged state assistance on constructing emergency berms.
   
 Emergency berms were up in Mexico Beach in a matter of months.
   
 The hiccup, Yeager said, was receiving a formal letter from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approving the berms as a portion of the construction would be within a zone protected under the Coastal Barrier Resource Act (CBRA).
   
 That letter has finally arrived, Yeager said.
   
 "They should be ready to bid (in the fall)," Yeager said.
   
 The "vegetative island" project is being funded by a $5 million grant, matched by state grant dollars the county had already received, to build islands of sand along the southern portion of the recently completed beach restoration project.
   
 In turn, that sand would be planted with sea oats and similar vegetation to promote protection of the beach and dune systems.
   
 "The project will also put about 75,000 cubic yards of sand into the system," Yeager said.
   
 To forward both projects, commissioners on Tuesday also approved the low and best bid on the contract to excavate sand from the county borrow pit in Honeyville.
   
 The sand would go toward the two projects almost exclusively, Yeager indicated.

 The project is more than two years overdue but commissioners finally awarded to GAC Contractors the contract for resurfacing and widening County 386 from U.S. 98 to Industrial Road.
   
 At $9.2 million, it is one of the largest contracts in the state under the Small County Outreach Program (SCOP), Administrator Michael Hammond said.
   
 The project was re-bid after questions concerning how bids were submitted and the scope of the project bid.
   
 "It was clear we were not on the same page," Hammond said.
   
 That was resolved, he added, by conducting a pre-bid conference with interested contractors.
   
 Southeastern Engineering received the engineering inspection portion of the project.
   
 Letters for dollars
   
 Between a special meeting last week and Tuesday's regular bi-monthly meeting, commissioners approved making two formal requests.
   
 Under the guidelines of the federal CARES Act to address the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the county is entitled to roughly $785,000, with the two cities receiving a cut of those dollars.
   
 Commissioners requested staff formally write Gov. Ron DeSantis to release the county's "fair share."
   
 Commissioners also approved a letter to the board of Triumph Gulf Coast requesting Triumph disburse the county's legislatively-pledged portion of funds for this fiscal year, about $3.2 million, directly to the county.
   
 Commissioners have stated a desire to act immediately to assist small businesses suffering in the county through a program of loans or grants.
   
 Triumph staff raised the issue as an option as the Triumph board considered how to react to the pandemic, but there has been no further discussion.
   
 Triumph has a planned phone conference meeting in mid-June.

The numbers are still being tabulated, so let's go with observation.
   
 Memorial Day, the beginning of the summer season, jumped out of the gate with plenty of gusto.
   
 The beaches and vacation rentals filled, the stores stayed busy and the restaurants did brisk business, though mostly carry-out or sidewalk dining, and there was almost normalcy, at least for a weekend.
   
 "It was really, really busy," said Kelli Godwin, executive director of the Gulf County Tourist Development Council. "It seemed like everybody had a fun and healthy Memorial Day.
   
 "Hopefully that will lead to a good summer."
   
 County staff, including Godwin, Assistant Administrator Warren Yeager and attorney Jeremy Novak, worked almost overnight to submit a roadmap to reopening the beaches after Gov. Ron DeSantis informed counties they could apply.
   
 Rep. Jason Shoaf (R-Port St. Joe) helped push the plan the governor's way.
   
 And it did not hurt that Halsey Beshears, who once sat in Shoaf's seat, head the Department of Business and Professional Regulation which had to approve each county's plan.
   
 In any case, by mid-week last week the green light was given and vacation rental companies were back in business.
   
 And it did not take visitors long to transform this area into the not-exactly- Forgotten Coast.
   
 "The guests are back in force on our beautiful Cape beaches," said resident Phil Dohmen.
   
 Not all was smooth as the weather, as attested to by Jody Daniels, head of EMS.
   
 "It was an interesting, interesting weekend," he said. "We pretty much had four trucks on the road at all times."
   
 Sheriff Mike Harrison said his staff was also busy, but nothing unexpected.
   
 "We were busy due to call volume and EMS calls and all that, but it wasn't a lot risk related," Harrison said. "But we did have a busy weekend just because of the calls."
   
 The department, he added, put a few people in jail due to warrants and drugs, but it was a busy weekend but "everything is going okay."
   
 The boat parking lot at the Frank Pate boat ramp in Port St. Joe was almost an event unto itself.
   
 At one time, there were over 100 trailers counted in the area of the ramp and as far away George Core Park, nearly to the Cape San Blas Lighthouse.
   
 Visitor or resident, the holiday weekend was a time of enjoyment after months of stress and closures.
   
 "The beauty and happiness the Cape brings my family is like nothing else," said Erica Williams.

But in an interview with BuzzFeed News, deBoisblanc said his comment about the hospital seeing "a year's worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks" was inaccurate. He added that at the time he didn't know what the true numbers were. Many of his other comments, which compared the number of deaths from COVID-19 to suicides, "were taken a bit out of context," he said.


  Numbers provided by the hospital and the coroner's office also show that the "sharp rise" in suicides initially claimed by deBoisblanc, which alarmed political pundits criticizing quarantine orders, were either overblown or outright false. According to the hospital, it has seen five suicide deaths during the county's shelter-in-place order, compared to two suicide deaths during the same period last year. In general, Contra Costa County sees about 100 suicide deaths per year, and officials said that that's remained stable so far in 2020.


  "If you look at it from a contextual standpoint, I think it's accurate," deBoisblanc told BuzzFeed News when asked whether the number of suicide attempts treated at the hospital was actually unprecedented. "If you contextualize in concrete numbers fashion, it's not accurate."  


  The original news story about a "spike" in suicides did not cite any data nor point to any numbers indicating an alarming trend.


  "Unfortunately, we have the data to prove it," deBoisblanc told ABC7, talking about the impact stay-at-home orders have had on mental health. When he later spoke to BuzzFeed News, he admitted that there was no data directly linking the suicide attempts seen at the hospital to the lockdowns.


  According to a statement released by the hospital, staff did see a slight increase in self-inflicted injuries between March 1 and May 8, with 13 incidents reported this year (compared to eight during the same time period last year).  


  The hospital has also seen one more suicide case than deaths from COVID-19, but deBoisblanc told BuzzFeed News the difference didn't point to a trend, nor did it illustrate the toll the pandemic has taken on the community's mental health.


  John Muir Medical Center is Contra Costa's trauma center, meaning emergency injuries and trauma, such as many suicide attempts, from all over the county with 1.1 million residents are most likely directed there. COVID-19 cases, on the other hand, have been more evenly distributed across all of the county's hospitals, a move medical officials took at the beginning of the pandemic to prevent overwhelming a single facility.  


  "We're the county's trauma center, so [our numbers] are skewed," deBoisblanc told BuzzFeed News.


  In fact, according to the Contra Costa County Coroner's Office, the number of suicides recorded in the Northern California county has remained relatively stable.


  Since March, when quarantine began, the county has seen 26 deaths that were determined to be suicides. Last year, the county saw 30 suicides between March and May.


  As of the day the ABC7 report was published, Contra Costa County had seen 36 deaths that were attributed to COVID-19.


  DeBoisblanc also said despite the comparison in the original article, it was not his intention to compare suicides to COVID-19 deaths. Instead, he said, it was to highlight the need to address mental health issues during the pandemic.


  "We're not in a competition in what disease is worse. That was never the intent," he told BuzzFeed News. "Just because we didn't get hit hard here [with COVID-19 cases] doesn't mean it's not a serious disease. That was not the intention."


  But once the story was published, it was quickly picked up by outlets like the Washington Examiner, RT, the Blaze, and Fox News.  


  Like deBoisblanc during his initial interview, commentators called for the lifting of restrictions on businesses, which health officials have said have been key to reducing the infection rate of the novel coronavirus.

Wouldn't it make more sense to test these high speed rams in a ryzen ecosystem? Or is 3600 and above still not stable there?


  You're better off waiting for Ryzen+ when it comes to higher-speed RAM, especially pushing above 3600. Personally I'd be perfectly happy if your typical 3600 kit ran fine out of the box with the flip of an XMP profile switch. An X470/Ryzen+ rig may very well be my next build, if board prices are reasonable.

OnePlus India General Manager Vikas Agarwal noted that this delay has forced the company to delay its sales timeline. He also noted that “production is already back up and running”. The company shared more details regarding the revised sales timeline in a dedicated post on OnePlus forums. Let’s check out the new OnePlus 8 series sale timeline here.
