The Big Ten set a fall schedule Saturday, but it won’t kick off until the weekend of Oct. 24. Voters will be allowed to include Big Ten teams on their ballots starting next week. Seven Big Ten teams were ranked in the preseason Top 25, including Ohio State at No. 2.
 Depending on how voters approach it, that could crowd out some teams currently ranked.
 The decreased field because of four Football Bowl Subdivision conferences initially deciding to delay play until the winter has been a boon in the early rankings for teams from the ACC and Group of Five conferences — including Marshall from Conference USA.
 The Thundering Herd beat Appalachian State on Saturday to improve to 2-0 and grab a spot in the Top 25. Appalachian State was the only team to drop out of the Top 25 after being No. 23.
 Marshall was last ranked in the final poll of the 2014 season. The Herd went 13-1 that season, reaching as high as No. 18 in the rankings, and won the Conference USA championship behind quarterback Rakeem Cato and running back Devon Johnson.
 ##  Poll points
 — Miami moved up five spots after beating ACC rival Louisville on the road. The Cardinals hung on to a ranking, slipping six spots to No. 24.
 — No. 21 Pittsburgh also jumped four spots with a convincing ACC victory against Syracuse.
 — No. 15 Oklahoma State dropped four spots after a sluggish performance in a victory against Tulsa. The Cowboys played much of the game without injured quarterback Spencer Sanders.

What the president said yesterday was he intends to send up a nominee very quickly. He said it would be a woman. What we don't know is when Senate Leader Mitch McConnell intends to take this nomination up, which he does. There's very little time in the Senate calendar between now and Election Day. And there's been some speculation that the vulnerable public and incumbents might not want to cast a vote before Election Day.
 Now, just in the last day, several of those endangered Republicans have said they're signed on with McConnell: Joni Ernst in Iowa, Tillis in North Carolina, McSally in Arizona. And so what we don't know is, are there four Republicans in the Senate, apart from Susan Collins, who said she would prefer to wait, Lisa Murkowski, who said she doesn't think there should be a vote till the new president is chosen. Chuck Grassley, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has also said that. But that leaves only three if they all do that.
 Many, many other Republicans have done a complete 180 around their position back in 2016 when they said no vote in a presidential year. And so it's going to be up to McConnell in the next day or two to decide does he want to try a vote now or does he want to wait till after the election and do it in a lame duck session?

While Hamby and Young both start the game on the bench, they both essentially play starters minutes. Hamby (28.3) and Young (25.8) rank first and second, respectively, in bench minutes, but also rank 27th and 44th, respectively, among all players in minutes per game.
 Las Vegas' starting five ranked 11th in scoring (53.8 PPG) and is last among the final four teams in the playoffs, but they more than make up for it with their bench players as Las Vegas led the WNBA in scoring this season at 88.7 points per game.

If Trump wins in November, this issue essentially goes away. Because even if the Democrats were to wind up taking the Senate, the lame duck Republicans in November could say, look, the people chose Trump, it's his nomination, and fine.
 If Trump were to lose and the Senate would go Democratic and the lame duck Republicans still said, we're going to confirm Trump's nominee in late November, then you're talking about whatever analogy you like. DEFCON-1, Armageddon on steroids. Chuck Schumer said everything's on the table. That could mean expanding the size of the Supreme Court, it could mean giving statehood to Puerto Rico and perhaps the District of Columbia for four more Democratic senators. That means the entire framework of our system is being essentially reduced to who has the power.

 OPINION
 # Veteran's Column:First Ohio Volunteer Cavalry
 Doug Stout
 Guest Columnist
 On Dec. 9, 1861, the First Ohio Volunteer Cavalry rode to the train station in Columbus for a trip to Cincinnati. Sergeant William H. “Scotty” Scott with the 1,000 other men loaded their horses and themselves onto train cars for the journey. They arrived in Cincinnati the next morning and that afternoon boarded ships for transportation downriver to Louisville. There they established an encampment at Camp Buell.
 The weather was severe and many men became sick with measles and other diseases. The first deaths in the regiment were in the early weeks at camp. One incident that helped break the monotony of camp was written by W.L. Curry in “Four Years in the Saddle—history of the First Ohio Volunteer Cavalry 1861-1865”. “By order of someone in authority, and we understood it at the time it was Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.H. Smith in the absence of Colonel Ransom, we were directed to have our sabers ground, and we marched into the city, one company at a time, to a machine shop, and had a razor edge put on our sabers, and we then imagined we were ready to go to chopping off heads in the most approved order of modern warfare. Colonel Ransom, on his return, was very indignant and ordered us to dull the edges by saber exercise and fencing, as they were very dangerous in drilling with saber when mounted, and besides, it was against the rules of civilized warfare. During the service of the regiment, we had many a laugh over our experience with our razor-edged sabers at Camp Buell.”
 They remained at Camp Buell before heading into the field in mid-January. At about that time, Colonel Ransom resigned. Until a new Colonel was appointed, the command of the regiment fell to Lieutenant Colonel Smith since he was the highest-ranking officer. In February, Senior Major Minor Milliken was promoted to Colonel. Many officers felt this unfair that Smith had been passed over for a promotion. When Milliken arrived at the camp on February 13, the officers, in an unusual act of what some would term a mutiny, met him and requested that he resign. They argued it would harm the morale of the regiment that Milliken was promoted and not Smith, who the officers felt deserved it. If he didn’t resign, some officers threatened that they would. Colonel Milliken refused to resign, and there was no mutiny. According to the history of the regiment, Milliken proved himself to the men and became the “idol of the regiment”.
 From the remainder of 1862, the First OVC saw service in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi. They had numerous skirmishes with the enemy, especially against the cavalry of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan. They were on the move until mid-November when they entered camp at Nashville, Tennessee. Here they received fresh horses and new equipment, and Colonel Milliken resumed the regiment’s drills.
 Scotty was now serving as the adjutant of the regiment. He, with the rest of the First OVC, had no idea that in a few short weeks, all of this training would be needed at a crucial time in a battle at a place called Stone River.

Focus is growing on Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who has broken with Trump before. There is another potential wrinkle: Because the Arizona Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as Nov. 30, which would narrow the window for McConnell if Democrat Mark Kelly wins.

7-Day ForecastFRIDAY: Clouds will linger around for a few more hours but as we transition into the late afternoon, skies will clear out. Mostly sunny skies are expected this evening and the forecast into the weekend looks dry and fall-like. It will be a little windy today with winds from the north around 10 mph with a gust upwards of 20 mph not out of the question. Some might say it'll be a little chilly today because temperatures are expected to be well below average. This will certainly get you in the mood for fall. Perfect sweatshirt and sweatpants weather. Highs around 64-66.

Really, when you think about Iowa, we've been in this presidential campaign for well over 18 months now. We had a competitive primary season here in Iowa and it's rolled right into some races that were not originally thought to be competitive, but have been and are.
 Iowa has kind of slipped back into a toss-up state by some prognosticators right now at the presidential level. But it's the battle for the U.S. Senate where you see a lot of interest and money being spent on the airwaves here. We also have three very competitive races for Congress.
