As reported earlier, Ukrainian plane crashed near Tehran Airport on December 8, leaving all 176 people on board killed. Iranian Air Force General Staff admitted that a Ukrainian passenger plane was shot down because of a human error. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani expressed deep regret over the tragedy and promised to bring those responsible to justice. The space forces of the IRGC claimed the full responsibility for the incident.

The Foxes went backwards though, finishing 10th in the Championship in the 2010-11 season, and following a poor start to the following campaign, Eriksson was replaced by former boss Nigel Pearson. They finished ninth that season, they made the play-offs the following season, and then in the 2013-14 campaign, the Foxes cruised to a second tier title. Throughout the following season, Leicester looked doomed to relegation, before Pearson orchestrated a remarkable great escape.

Local man looks to invigorate Wayland Area Revitalization
   
 WAYLAND -- A local man is taking an active leadership role in enhancing the community through a community organization with plenty of potential, Wayland Area Revitalization.
   
 Mr. Eric Williams II has an overwhelming passion to see his hometown blossom into the place he envisions it can be.
   
 Wayland Area Revitalization, or W.A.R., began this journey in 2007 with the help of a handful of eager citizens. W.A.R.'s Founder, Marian Crawford, is still persistent in her ideas on making the community a better place to live, work, and grow.
   
 "My role will be president of the organization. One of my first priorities with the organization is to reestablish a board of directors. I'll be looking for people that have passion and energy to make change by being the change," Williams said. "We live in a community where many folks are okay with staying content. Which is why I believe the business population has went down year after year. We need excitement, we need energy and we need people that will be consistent.
   
 "After I establish the board, we will reach out to the businesses in the Wayland area, and have a meeting with them all to come up with things they are struggling with as a business, what they would like to see in Wayland, and from Wayland," Williams continued. "The local government can't expect businesses to come to Wayland and not be supported by them. Then I plan to sit down with local government and collaborate on how this organization can help Wayland flourish and be the beautiful town it is."
   
 Williams plans to continue the projects already in the works. There are several legacy projects such as The Point, The Nature Trail, and overall beautification of downtown.
   
 "Next, I'll continue on with the project that the organization was already working on, which was The Point. That's located at the end of north main intersecting with North Lackawanna," he said. "Marian Crawford worked very diligently in obtaining that piece of property to be owned by the Village, and even though the previous occupants owed back taxes, she was able to get the property taxes wiped away and it was purchased for one dollar. The hope was to have some type of signage saying it was Wayland and about the Southern Finger Lakes. So, we will continue to partner with the American Legion on that project."
   
 Williams has some bright ideas for the future of the town, so that the youth has a nice place to go for study, play, and relaxation.
   
 "In the future, I'd like to work with the village and come up with something to do with the lot that was just taken down by the Village across from Five Star Bank. It's right on Main Street, it definitely needs to be beautified. Maybe with a gazebo, and a flower garden of some sort. I'd also like to tackle Victory Park. We need a better playground for our kids, so I'd love to work with the community and work to get the park redone."
   
 The downtown business district has needed a lot of work over the years. Williams needs someone who understands the process of grant writing to join the team and help make Wayland Great Again.
   
 "I want to apply for grants and help the village spice up our Main Street, so we would need to work with the village, and see what their vision is, and help them make it happen! Those are just a few of the things I plan to take on," he said.
   
 Williams reached out to Crawford about keeping this organization alive and breathing new life into it as we go into 2020.
   
 "I got involved because I love this community. Wayland has so much potential, but not enough folks that step up and make it happen. After listening to the founder of this organization, Marian Crawford, and her love for its possibilities, I knew then I had to be a part of it. I'm super excited about this opportunity, it's a blessing to be able to join, and to make things happen. If any business owners or residents of Wayland want to talk, please don't hesitate to reach out to me." Williams concluded.
   
 As of next week, the new board needs to be available. Williams needs a director, treasurer, secretary and someone who can write grants. This is a non-profit organization, so all positions are run by volunteers. If you have a passion for the community and want to help, call Williams at 585-519-8579.

Proprio l’art. 18 ha rappresentato per quasi trentacinque anni il cardine della disciplina limitativa dei licenziamenti e ha costituito in definitiva il più efficace riconoscimento e la più ampia garanzia a livello individuale dei diritti e delle libertà enunciate dallo Statuto. In sostanza, ogni volta che il giudice avesse ritenuto illegittimo un licenziamento, la sanzione prevista era la reintegrazione nel posto di lavoro (nel caso di imprese con più di 15 dipendenti). La norma, però, ha subito una pesante rivisitazione per opera delle riforme del 2012 e del 2015. Nel 2012 la riforma del lavoro Fornero ha previsto, al posto della sola reintegra, quattro differenti regimi di tutela che si applicano gradatamente a seconda della gravità dei vizi che inficiano il licenziamento. In seguito, poi, alla promulgazione e attuazione del Jobs Act da parte del governo Renzi, attraverso l'emanazione di diversi provvedimenti legislativi varati tra il 2014 e il 2015, l'art. 18 è rimasto in vigore per i soli rapporti instaurati prima del 7 marzo 2015 (data di entrata in vigore del decreto legislativo numero 23/2015) e già destinatari della tutela prevista dalla norma. Da tale data, infatti, per i contratti a tempo indeterminato si applica la disciplina del cosiddetto contratto a tutele crescenti, introdotta sempre dal dlgs 23/2015 (decreto attuativo del Jobs Act). Per tutti i lavoratori assunti con contratto di lavoro subordinato a tempo indeterminato e licenziati ingiustamente, la norma prevede come sanzione principale un pagamento di un’indennità risarcitoria, limitando ulteriormente le ipotesi di reintegrazione nel posto di lavoro.

We wax poetic about air fryers that are big enough for meals for the whole family (and then some), but if you're in a smaller household or are cooking for one, a smaller design better suits. Take, for instance, the GoWISE 4.6-QT Stainless Electric Air Fryer (now on sale for $89.99). This affordable option can crisp up your ingredients at up to 400 degrees with complete ease, as well as reheat food at its ideal temperature (no sub-par french fries here). And its four-quart design means you won't be going overboard on meals unless you know, you want to.

Novak Djokovic swept past long-time rival Rafael Nadal in a battling display at the ATP Cup final Sunday to lay down a marker ahead of the Australian Open.
 The Serbian world number two blasted the top-ranked Spaniard off court 6-2 in the first set before a much tighter 7-6 (7/4) second set.
 It left the final of the inaugural team event finely poised at 1-1 after Spain's reliable Roberto Bautista Agut caned Dusan Lajovic 7-5, 6-1.
 Nadal and Djokovic were both expected back on court to play the decisive doubles rubber that will decide which country wins the 24-nation tournament.
 "Every time I get to play Rafa we get to play a lot of exciting points. There were some incredible exchanges today," said Djokovic.
 "I started off the match perfectly, everything worked. I'm just really glad I held my nerve in the end."
 Djokovic, warming up for his bid to win an eighth Australian Open crown this month, went into the clash at Sydney's Ken Rosewall Arena leading their head- to-heads 28-26.
 But the statistics did not tell the full story.
 The Serb had won nine of their past 12 contests and been dominant over the years on hard courts -- including a comfortable win against Nadal in the Australian Open final last year.
 He showed his intent immediately, breaking Nadal in the opening game when the Spaniard netted a backhand, and there was no let-up.
 His driving groundstrokes and deft touches proved too much with Nadal's serve constantly under siege as Djokovic delivered a booming ace to wrap up the set.
 Nadal lifted to another level in the second set and it was an intense affair, with Djokovic saving five break points in a crucial sixth game.
 It went to a tiebreaker where a crunching backhand down the line from the Serb gave him the break he needed to complete the victory.

"Juve have some problems in defence," the European Cup winner told _Sky Calcio Club._ "They're conceding too many goals in every game.


  "Indeed, Sarri has put Demiral in there in place of De Ligt. He's not fit? That's what they're saying... But Bonucci needs a player like Demiral more than one like De Ligt."


  Certainly, De Ligt's acclimatisation hasn't been helped by the knee ligament tear that Chiellini suffered on August 30.


  The plan had always been to introduce the Dutchman slowly into the first team, allowing to him gradually get to grips with the demands of the Italian game alongside one of the finest exponents of the defensive arts in world football.


  Instead, Chiellini's injury thrust De Ligt into the spotlight, against Napoli, after he had been benched for the Serie A opener against Parma.


  Things didn't go particularly well, with De Ligt conceding two penalties for handball in his next six Serie A appearances.


  Scoring the winning goal in the Derby della Mole against Torino, in November, boosted his confidence, but his pace and positioning were again called into question after Juve slumped to a 3-1 loss to Lazio on December 15.


  When the champions faced the free-scoring Biancocelesti again a week later, this time in the Supercoppa Italiana, De Ligt was had already been dropped and spent the entire game on the bench.


  As it stands, he hasn't seen a second of game time since a 14-minute cameo against Udinese just under a month ago.

It is no wonder that the proposed hike has been met with serious opposition across the board, and rightly so. The ineffectiveness of NERC means that consumers of electricity will persistently have to pay more for ending poor quality of service provided by the Discos. In addition, the inefficient privatisation process that saw the transfer of the unbundled electricity assets to technically and financially incompetent investors meant that even with expected tariff increase, the provision of substantial and sustainable electricity and electricity infrastructure would unlikely be achieved any time in the near or far future, thus perpetuating the sordid state of service provision in the sector.

Democrats just won’t give up on the cause of Iran getting nuclear weapons.


  First off, we had President Barack Obama spending months and more months on a deal that shoved all kinds of obstacles out of the way. Then we had President Donald Trump yanking the United States out of the deal and actually fighting back with deadly force against a general specializing in terrorism who had killed 600 Americans. Democrats have been outraged, worrying about a war that’s not exactly likely while, with some qualifications, presidential candidates say they will get us back in the Obama deal if Trump is defeated in this year’s election.


  That promise might not tell the Iranians they will get all of Obama’s gifts again, but it certainly sends hints to the dictators that they need not worry too much, that they can get rid of sanctions wrecking their economy and maybe still grin their way to mushroom clouds. In the interim, the horror of the left at what Trump did is itself close to a horror, a message to Iranians that they have cheerleaders across the Atlantic. Their tale has been that Trump acted recklessly, that he may have cheated the Constitution, that war is a done deal with him in office and that Congress must rise up by way of rescue.

Jackson participated in throwing drills on the second to last day of the 2018 NFL Combine.


  "When Jackson let the deep balls fly, he had some expected issues with accuracy," SN's Vinnie Iyer wrote at the time. "Once comfortable and settled, he was crisp in connecting with receivers on intermediate routes in the middle of the field. ... Make no mistake — even with his weaknesses, Jackson will go off the board among the top 32 picks in April.


  "In a way, by choosing not to run or jump, Jackson added a little more to his mystique at the Combine. Even though it would be disappointing to Jackson's agent (Jackson himself) to be slotted out of the top 10 picks, it would be better for his long-term prosperity not to be taken by one of those teams."


  Like he did at the Combine, Jackson for the same reasons declined to participate in running drills at Louisville's Pro Day later that spring.


  Fortunately, none of this mattered to the Ravens, who loved Jackson as a quarterback all along. Baltimore general manager Eric DeCosta recently told NBC Sports' Peter King the league-wide doubt surrounding Jackson's prospects as an NFL QB was helpful in allowing the passer to fall to the Ravens.


  ## Lamar Jackson 40-yard dash time


  While Jackson did not record a 40-yard dash time at the 2018 NFL Combine or at Louisville's Pro Day ahead of the draft, he was asked about his 40 time while addressing Baltimore media the day after the Ravens picked him with the last selection of the first round.


  "4.34," Jackson said. "I ran it with turf toe, too, so I don't know what I really run."


  The Ravens, obviously, didn't care to know the exact 40 time for a quarterback who rushed for 4,132 yards and 50 touchdowns in three seasons at Louisville.

Indeed, Marshall's stance isn't in itself surprising. What is surprising is how flimsy it is.


  Marshall lays out his concerns in a letter to state lawmakers, and his primary concern is that allowing medical marijuana use would conflict with federal law.


  “State laws that allow any use of marijuana, medical or recreational, are in direct conflict with duly-enacted and clearly-constitutional federal law," Marshall wrote. "Thus, state marijuana statutes enacted in violation of federal law are damaging to the rule of law itself — a costly precedent that I urge you to bear in mind."


  If it's Marshall's position that the state of Alabama must bend the knee to federal law, this would be a first. Alabama, historically, has had no such qualms about challenging "clearly-constitutional federal law" when it comes to issues of civil rights. Indeed the state, and Marshall in his capacity as attorney general, are challenging the federal government right now, defending the nation's toughest abortion restrictions in a direct challenge to the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.


  The difference when it comes to medical marijuana — and even recreational marijuana use, which isn't an issue here — is the states have been given, if not explicit authority, tacit consent to experiment with loosed restrictions.


  Marshall also worries about the health effects, drawing comparisons between marijuana and opioids.


  “As with opioids, marijuana is an addictive drug,” he wrote. “Approximately one in 10 adult users of marijuana develops an addiction.”

This is Santini's second time working at the Limelight during her summer break. She came to work here to have an adventure and to get better at English, she said.


  Each year about 100,000 students come to the U.S. through the Work Travel program. Those in the southern hemisphere come during their summer, which is our winter. When it’s summer here, students mostly come from Europe to take their places.


  Established the same year as the Peace Corps, the J-1 visa program was intended to promote international understanding. Au pairs and camp counselors come to the U.S. on these visas. But Summer Work Travel students like Santini who work in the leisure and hospitality sectors make up the majority of the visa's recipients.


  ___


  An "Irreplaceable" Program


  Despite J-1's origin to promote cultural exchange, a report out last summer by the International Labor Recruitment Working Group (ILRWG) finds it has become more of a temporary guestworker program.


  For employers, J-1 visas help fill labor gaps, especially when there’s a low unemployment rate. Tourism-based economies in places like Idaho are increasingly relying on the program to fit their needs. Work Travel employees nearly doubled in Idaho between 2015, when there were 382 students, to 2018, when 684 students got jobs through the program, according to the U.S. State Department.


  Data made available by ILRWG's FOIA requests, and shared with Boise State Public Radio, show Sun Valley Resort as the top employer of J-1 Work Travel workers in Idaho, as of 2015, which is the latest year for which the group received company-specific data.


  “The program is irreplaceable, and without it, businesses like mine would struggle," said John Curnow, the General Manager of the Limelight Hotel in Ketchum, which is owned by the Aspen Skiing Company.


  Curnow said the company tries to hire locally, but that's a challenge, Ketchum City Councilman Michael David said, for low-wage positions in a high- rent town.


  “You can open the classifieds section of the newspaper at any time of the year and you’re going to have multiple pages of help-wanted ads in the service industry,” David said.


  Ruslan Mukhamadiev was finishing up a housekeeping job at the Mountain Village Resort last September in Stanley, another resort town an hour north.


  “To pay for this program, I needed to sell my car,” he said outside the resort's restaurant, facing the Salmon River.


  Coming to the U.S. through the Work Travel program is expensive. There’s the visa, money owed to third-party sponsors, the plane tickets and new clothes. All together, Mukhamadiev, who is from Russia, said it cost him around $5,000.


  “Yeah, everybody found a second job,” he said.


  Councilman David, back in Ketchum, said the visa recipients help lessen a whole community’s hiring burden when they pick up second and third jobs at grocery stores, restaurants or landscaping companies.


  “It’s essential," David said. "It keeps this tourist-based economy going.”


  After arriving in Stanley, Mukhamadiev took a second job at the resort’s restaurant, and a third one at the ice cream shop, Stanley Scoops. The ice cream shop was his favorite job, he said, because of the interactions he had with Americans.


  “Everybody is talking with you; everybody is asking, ‘Where are you from?” “What are you doing here?’”


  ___


  Potential Reforms On The Horizon


  It’s the type of experience the ILRWG said many work-travel students miss out on when they work behind the scenes in housekeeping or at places like Six Flags and McDonald’s — two of the biggest employers of work-travel students.


  Another issue, according to the group’s report from last summer, is the U.S. State Department manages the J-1 visa program. Catherine Bowman, who requested and analyzed the data for the report and for her dissertation at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said State Department is not set up to oversee a jobs program for potential exploitation or discrimination.

There have also been mistakes against Arsenal (twice), Manchester City (again), Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Everton. United’s defence should have become far more resilient with Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire, but they remain blighted by uncertainty and De Gea has not gone unaffected. At times, he has been a contributing factor.


  When De Gea first arrived in England, he struggled and was plainly vulnerable. He suffered with overtly physical challenges and became a target at set-pieces. Instead of being cowed, though, he toughened up. Now is the time for him to improve again.


  At 29, De Gea has to learn to become a leader. And not by example – at his best, he already he does that. Now he has to organise his back line positionally.


  Luke Shaw is unreliable, Victor Lindelof goes into his shell at the sight of a bouncing ball and only Wan-Bissaka is a top-class defender. If Solskjaer and his coaches are not able to improve the defence off the pitch, then they must be better marshalled on it. To date, De Gea has been too quiet and too tepid in this regard.


  There is more to do than simply point and shout. De Gea is a world class shot-stopper, perhaps the greatest the country has ever seen, but there should be more to his game by now.


  He does not have the distribution to make his defenders' lives easier. The backline, by design or default, plays too far back to pressure other sides. They are not comfortable enough on the ball to make the most of such an approach, but United need a goalkeeper who plays a greater role on the ball.


  It does not have to be a radical overhaul of De Gea and United’s approach to the game, but it must be included if they are to match the modern way.


  While other clubs struggle to find one decent goalkeeper, it is United’s fortune to have two. There are few positives from Louis van Gaal’s time at the club, but the signing of Sergio Romero has given the club perhaps the best reserve keeper in the Premier League.


  Romero had a similarly shaky start to his time at the club, but he has earned many of his 32 clean sheets with the club. His save against Wolves’ Matt Doherty at Molineux on Saturday marked out his own impressive reflexes.


  Of course, the Argentine has the advantage of playing in cup games when the opposition is generally less dangerous, but his five seasons at the club have established him as a reliable back-up.

“We usually just cut one hole and each take turns going down into the water,” Sack said. “Today, we’re splitting up into some teams because we have a total of three sets of fish habitat to install.”


  He said the habitat is big and needs to be constructed under the ice as well. Three sets were installed at the lake. Sack described what it is like to go under the ice.


  “When you are exhaling, the bubbles are rising to the top and they get trapped under the ice,” Sack said. “When you’re under the ice and you’re looking up, you can see the light and see your bubbles running like a psychedelic lava lamp or something.”


  Two types of diving suits were used to go under the ice. One is known as a dry suit and the other is a wet suit. The wet suit is filled with water that heats up by the diver’s body temperature and the dry suit is warmed by the exhaled air from the diver.

It was in 2014 that everything changed for Salford City, as a group of players often referred to as Manchester United's Class of '92, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt each acquiring 10% of the club. Billionaire Peter Lim purchased the other 50%, although he has since sold 10% of his shares in the club to David Beckham. In the five seasons since, Salford have been promoted four times, investing heavily in both the playing squad, youth development and the club's Moor Lane ground. Going into the new decade, Salford are now a top half team in League Two, and the club has ambitions of reaching the Premier League over the course of the next ten years.

The monarch and the sultan watched an equestrian event together in Oman in 2010 during a state visit to the country, and they both attended a banquet in Claridge's Hotel held in his honour in 1982.
 In 1979, the sultan attended a dinner on board the royal yacht Britannia.
 Qaboos had travelled to the UK in 1958 to attend Sandhurst and joined the British Army where he was posted to the 1st Battalion The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and served in Germany for a year.
 He had also studied local government in Suffolk at the age of 18 - briefly holding a post with Suffolk County Council - but returned to his country and seized the throne from his father in a bloodless coup in 1970.
 Charles visited Sultan Qaboos at his palace at Bayt al Baraka on a tour of the Middle East with Camilla on March 2013 and with his then-wife Diana in 1986.
 Just last month, the Duke of Cambridge held an audience with the sultan at the Palace of Bait al Baraka at the end of a four-day tour of Kuwait and Oman.

BLUEFIELD — When the decision was made to assassinate top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, it was the accumulation of years of intelligence, a thorough analysis of all of the ramifications and a consensus that the timing was right.
 Bluefield City Manager Dane Rideout, a retired U.S. Army Colonel, former garrison commander at West Point and an officer who spent 12 years in Special Operations, said “while I am now out of the military and another “arm chair quarterback,” Americans should look beyond political rhetoric and raw emotions to understand that the people behind the scenes who help make these decisions are experienced, talented and experts in their fields.”
 “The individual who was targeted along with another top Iraqi militia military leader, it was absolutely the right thing to do,” he said.

England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler has apologised for his foul-mouthed verbal volley in the second test against South Africa, but questioned whether television viewers should have access to the audio from stump microphones.
 Buttler was fined 15% of his match fee and handed one demerit point after swearing repeatedly at South Africa all-rounder Vernon Philander late on the final day as England sought the wickets that would take them to a 189-run win.
 “I fully understand that as role models we have a duty to behave in a certain way. I would like to apologise and understand that is not the way to behave. I take the slap on the wrist,” Buttler told reporters on Sunday.
 “It was the heat of the moment and a bit of red mist. But it is all done and can now be swept under the carpet so we can move on.”
 Asked whether he felt the audio from the stump microphones should be available to the public, Buttler said most players were against it.
 “In test cricket there is high emotion at times. There can be things said that dont mean anything, but for the viewers at home it can come across very poorly,” he said.
 “It is a tough one, we understand that it adds to the viewer experience to have stump mics to hear a bit of what goes on.
 “But I think the players like the thinking of what happens on the field, stays on the field, and isnt heard necessarily by everyone at home.”
 Buttler felt England created energy around the bat in Cape Town with their attempts to unsettle the home batsmen.
 “It is easy to say vocal is the way to do things, but also your actions speak loud as well. One of the good things in that last game was the way we hunted as a team,” he said.
 “We have a number of young guys under the age of 24 in the side and they were fantastic at creating energy around the bat and putting pressure on the opposition.
 “The two games have been played in a great spirit, they have been hard-fought and the series is set up really well at 1-1.”
 The third test starts at St Georges Park in Port Elizabeth on Thursday.

Iranian media meanwhile focused on the admission of responsibility for the crash, with several newspapers calling for those responsible to apologize and resign.


  The hardline daily Vatan-e Emrouz bore the front-page headline, “A sky full of sadness,” while the Hamshahri daily went with “Shame,” and the IRAN daily said “Unforgivable.”


  Mehdi Karroubi, an opposition activist under house arrest, lashed out at Khamenei himself.


  “You, as the commander in chief of the armed forces, are directly responsible for this," he said in a statement. “If you were aware and you let military and security authorities deceive people, then there is no doubt you lack the attributes of constitutional leadership."


  Criticism of the supreme leader is punishable by up to two years in prison.


  Tensions with the United States eased after the ballistic missile attack, when President Donald Trump declined to respond and welcomed Iran's apparent decision to stand down.


  The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, traveled to Iran for talks with senior officials. Qatar hosts a large U.S. military base and shares an offshore gas field with Iran. It has often served as a mediator between the two countries, which have no diplomatic relations.


  Syria's Prime Minister Imad Khamis was also leading a high-level delegation to Iran, which includes the defense and foreign ministers. Syrian state media described it as an “important visit” in light of recent events, without elaborating. Iran is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country's civil war, and Soleimani had mobilized militias and coordinated military aid.


  Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was also traveling to Iran, with plans to visit Saudi Arabia the following day.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's security forces deployed in large numbers across the capital on Sunday, expecting more protests after its Revolutionary Guard admitted to accidentally shooting down a passenger plane at a time of soaring tensions with the United States.


  Riot police in black uniforms and helmets massed in Vali-e Asr Square, Tehran University and other landmarks as calls circulated for protests later in the day. Revolutionary Guard members patrolled the city on motorbikes and plainclothes security men were also out in force. People looked down as they walked briskly past the police, hoping not to draw attention to themselves.


  The plane crash early Wednesday killed all 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians. After initially pointing to a technical failure and insisting the armed forces were not to blame, authorities on Saturday finally admitted to accidentally shooting it down in the face of mounting evidence and accusations by Western leaders.

 The stock movement is supported by strong company fundamentals, including 27% ARR growth and a 23% free cash flow margin.
 The stock price is valued a little higher than other stocks in my digital transformation stock universe, but not so overvalued to withhold a Bullish rating. The stock is moving now and I suggest that investors embrace this opportunity.

Bloomberg) -- Iranian security forces stepped up patrols in Tehran, seeking to quell further anti-government protests after the regime admitted downing a Ukrainian passenger jet, triggering anger on the streets and global outrage.
 Videos on social media, which couldn't immediately be verified by Bloomberg, showed motorcycle-mounted security forces in green camouflage and anti-riot body armor stationed on the city's Valiasr square on Sunday morning. There was also a heavy police presence outside Tehran university.
 In the face of the growing tensions, some of the organizers of a candlelight vigil Saturday that turned into an angry protest against the regime, were now urging people on social media to avoid a rally initially planned for 6 p.m., local time, at the city's landmark Azadi Square.
 Anger spread across the globe after Iran's leaders admitted that the military accidentally shot down the a Ukrainian jetliner on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, after mistaking it for a cruise missile. The announcement marked a dramatic reversal after the regime spent days denying it had downed the jet, accusing Western governments of "psychological warfare."
 Large crowds of students demonstrated outside Amir Kabir University in downtown Tehran late Saturday for the candlelight vigil, according to witnesses, before starting chants of "death to the dictator" and "resignation is not enough, a trial is needed!" Security forces intervened to disperse the demonstrators. The British Ambassador to Iran Rob Macaire was briefly detained after he attended the vigil.
 Others used social media to vent their anger, contrasting the plane deaths with reports that the Iranian attack on the Iraqi bases on Wednesday when the plane was downed was specifically designed not to injure Americans.
 The government's admission that Iran's security forces hold ultimate responsibility for the downing of the plane -- albeit at a time of conflict with their chief foe -- is a further blow for the country's ruling clerics at a time when the economy has been devastated by U.S. sanctions. The admission appears to have undercut the sense of national unity that built after the Jan. 3 killing by the U.S. of Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani -- a hero to many Iranians for his work in Iraq and Syria helping to defeat Islamic State.
 "We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage," Trump said Saturday in a tweet posted in Farsi and English.
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Saturday said he was "outraged" and "furious" by the admission that Iran had shot down Ukrainian International Airlines Flight PS752. At least 57 Canadians were among the dead.
 "What Iran has admitted to is very serious. Shooting down a civilian aircraft is horrific. Iran must take full responsibility," Trudeau said Saturday at a press briefing in Ottawa. He earlier declared the incident a national tragedy.
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised address that he wants a full admission of guilt by Iran for what authorities there called a "disastrous mistake."
 Ukraine and Iran will work jointly to decode the black boxes of the doomed Ukrainian Boeing jet, Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian government will make payments to the families of each of those who died in the crash, he said.
 "I urge all international partners of Ukraine, the entire world community, to be united and to keep pressing until the full and final investigation into all the circumstances of this catastrophe is delivered," said Zelenskiy.
 Trudeau and his British counterpart Boris Johnson called for justice for the victims, and signaled that the disaster reinforced the need for a de- escalation of hostilities in the Gulf region.
 A senior Trump administration official, who declined to be identified, said the tragedy showed Iran's "reckless actions have again had devastating consequences."
 The three-year-old Boeing Co. 737-800 was shot down about two minutes after takeoff from Tehran. The tragedy occurred hours after Iran started launching rockets against Iraqi bases where U.S. forces are stationed, in retaliation for Soleimani's targeted killing. Nearly half the victims were Iranians, while many of the other passengers, including citizens of Canada, Sweden and the U.K., were of Iranian descent, a reflection of the ambition that pushes thousands to leave Iran each year to work and study in the West.
 The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's aerospace force, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, blamed the tragedy on a communications failure. The operative who first mistakenly identified the plane as an incoming missile failed to get a second opinion due to a "disturbance" and had only 10 seconds to make a decision, he said. The army had previously said that "culprits" would be turned over to judicial authorities.
 "When I was certain that this incident had occurred, I truly wished death upon myself, because I'd rather have died than witness such an incident," Hajizadeh said in a briefing Saturday in Tehran.
 Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, offered his condolences to the victims of the Ukrainian flight, while President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic Republic "deeply regrets the disastrous mistake" and vowed compensation for the families of victims.

You know, I'm not one to take away credit from the mamas. We do a lot of crap for our kids. We birth them, we feed them, we are usually the ones at home with them when they are sick, we run them everywhere they need to go, and so on and so forth.
 Last night, just like 99% of other nights, Michael and I took our boys up to bed. I tucked them in while he got their movies started. We said our good nights and came down to bed ourselves. After being situated in bed for about 15 minutes, the first kid comes down needing a drink. Then the next kid comes down, saying, "I can’t sleep." And then the next kid. This goes on for close to an hour before the crying starts. Which is where we get to the point of this story.
 Once I am settled and snuggled into bed, I don't like to get up. Not to check on the kids, not to go to the bathroom, not at all. My sleep routine requires staying in bed without moving to fall asleep. If you have trouble sleeping, you understand the struggle. Moving wakes the mind and then the mind doesn’t shut down. It's a whole process.
 Anyway, my husband is the true hero at bedtime.
 Child comes down crying. "I can't sleep because Rocks TV is too loud." So, up and out of bed my husband goes, upstairs to adjust the volume. Back down, snuggled in bed, five minutes later the third child comes down, "I can't hear my TV now and I missed a part and you won’t come rewind it so I can hear it." Up, out of bed my husband goes to adjust the volume for a second time and rewind the show.
 Almost nightly he has to get up and resolve a crisis with the children. Maybe this is an embarrassing example of how spoiled I am, or maybe it’s a sample of how much of a pushover we are as parents. However you choose to see it, I am choosing to look at it as a way to recognize the dedication and true love my husband has for our kids. Because if it was up to me, the children would just have to deal, cause mama ain’t getting out of bed.

Rideout said Soleimani, who was commander of Iran’s Quds Force, a division primarily responsible for extraterritorial military and clandestine operations, had for many years helped either harm or kill some of his friends and fellow soldiers in attacks based on Soleimani-backed militia.
 Although an assassination could have happened before, military leaders and government intelligence agencies had previously made assessments much like a chess game and determined the aftermath may not be worth the action, he said.
 But in recent years that has changed as Soleimani had become more brazen with Iranian aggression.
 “He got too comfortable,” Rideout said. “We were literally able to target him inside Iraq while meeting with senior militia operatives preparing to conduct operations against coalition and Iraqi forces.”
 The President makes the ultimate decision on such an act, he said, but not before being surrounded by senior leadership of the military, service secretaries, chiefs of each branch of the military, the chairman of the joint chiefs and intelligence-gathering agencies (FBI, CIA and NSA, for example).
 “Many people are advising him. I know of a lot of them,” he said. “They are brilliant, they operate at the enterprise level, true masters of their craft. He (the President) gets a menu of options and the possible ramifications for each option.”
 Rideout said those military advisers are also a diverse group – Democrats, Republicans, male, female, black, white, Asian, a “think tank.”
 “He is well-advised and he can make very accurate and timely decisions,” he said of the President.
 “We had been tracking Soleimani for years,” he said. “He was making decisions that were killing Americans in the early 2000s” and associated with terrorists in other countries, including countries in Northern Africa’s Trans Sahel region where it is a “no man’s land and ungoverned space.”
 “He was training terrorists, organizing, equipping them and then sending them into places like Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan … he was all over the place,” Rideout said. “They (U.S. intelligence) had him in the crosshairs on several occasions.”
 But before the trigger could be pulled, both the tactical and political pieces had to be in place, and a big factor that led up the assassination was that Solemani had become more audacious with more aggressive tactics in recent years.
 When the drone took him out last week, the political and tactical pieces fit together and there was a consensus of many minds that the timing was right, the place was right, and the purpose was right, he said.
 Rideout said people often concentrate too much on an individual when these decisions are made, forgetting that a group of military advisors and others is “assuring we do the right thing.”
 “I know too many people inside the military and in the federal government who I trust implicitly and still talk to,” he said. “No one wants to start another war, but we don’t like bullies and Iran is the bully in that region.”
 Rideout said he was not surprised by what happened afterwards with the rocket attack that did little damage and resulted in no casualties.
 “I have been to both of those bases in Iraq (Al-Assad and Irbil, where the rockets hit),” he said. “They are very spread out unlike the green zone.”
 Not only that, Iraqis were warned by Iran of the attack, giving everyone time to prepare.
 Rideout said it was a strategic, well thought out response with the intention of not escalating the situation.
 Iran had to respond, he said, but at the same time they know just how powerful and how surgical the force they were facing.
 “They know what we are capable of doing to that country. They had to show their people something and now they can go back and say they responded.”
 The result, he said, is that “diplomacy can hopefully take back over.”
 But a dangerous terrorist has been eliminated and the hope is to normalize relations as best as possible through diplomacy.
 Rideout has extensive experience in the Middle East, and was one of the first Americans in 2003 attached to “Task Force Viking,” a joint special operations task force created to secure the northern border and the oil fields at Kirkuk, which Saddam Hussein had set on fire.
 That mission demonstrated the process of making decisions and how to deal with difficult situations, he said, and just how thorough briefings are and that politicians will listen.
 “We briefed five different courses of action, five different options,” he said, including one “throwaway course of action, really thinking outside the box.”
 “We called it The Ugly Baby,” he said of that outside the box idea, and in the end it was so audacious it was the one chosen based upon the political situation. It turned out to be the longest infiltration mission since World War II, flying the spine of Syria into Northern Iraq, below most radar.
 The mission was a success and “we did not lose a single person or aircraft,” linking up with Kurdish tribal warlords in Northern Iraq and completing the task.
 During his career in the military, he served under presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
 He does not comment on politics, saying presidents do “both good and bad things” relating to the operations of the military, but they do listen.
 Rideout said he also met former President Obama when he was on a tour in Afghanistan.

According to Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi, Qureshi will hold talks with Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and other officials on the current situation in the region.
 The foreign minister will then travel to Riyadh where he will hold talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud and consult on the issues of regional peace and stability.
 During his visits, Qureshi will share Pakistan's perspective on the current situation by stressing the imperative of avoiding any conflict.
 The foreign minister will convey Pakistan's readiness to support all efforts that facilitate the resolution of differences and disputes through political and diplomatic means.
 FM Qureshi will then travel to Washington on Jan 15 where he will meet senior officials of Donald Trump administration to discuss the Middle East crisis.
 On Saturday, the foreign minister had expressed the hope that tensions between Iran and the US would decrease after Tehran admitted it had accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner that killed all 176 people on board the aircraft.
 “Iran’s confession of downing Ukrainian passenger plane should ease up tensions as the region can neither endure tension nor can it tolerate war anymore,” he had said.
 Tensions between Iran and the US simmered down after President Trump held a press conference in the aftermath of the Al-Asad retaliation and offered peace to the people of Iran.
 He said the US was "ready to have peace with all those who seek it".
 Trump said the US wanted Iran to have a "great and prosperous future with other countries of the world".

Djed Spence has been a revelation on the right. He has incredible pace - rewatch his sprint to close down spooked Spurs defender Jan Vertoghen - and tricky feet and a willingness to run at defenders.


  And, as we saw when he muscled aside Wayne Rooney, he is not scared to mix it with the big boys and is not overawed.


  His presence and confidence is amazing when you consider he has only played eight games - although he is yet to be on a losing side so maybe that brings an extra buzz.


  On the other flank Hayden Coulson is coming on in leaps and bounds. He was excellent again against Derby.


  He does the nuts and bolts of defending well enough but going forward he adds real oomph to Boro’s armoury.


  Coulson tears up the flanks, is fearless in running directly at opposition full-backs, has the ability to beat them and he can whip in a delicious cross.


  But he makes the press work too. He is tenacious and full of spark. He chases and closes and growls and snaps into tackles as he joins the posses up front in mugging rivals.

While instituting an effective cost-reflective tariff is very critical to the improvement of the electricity sector, it must go hand in hand with commensurate improvement in quality of electricity supply. A situation where metering coverage is extremely low and where power supply duration per day is on average just two hours if at all, makes little or no economic sense and disincentivises customers to pay their bills. Over the years, and even more so now, the electricity industry in Nigeria has grown into a massive uncompetitive sellers' market, characterised by price takers, asymmetric information and heavy barriers to entry and exit. Increasing tariffs while quality of service remains low means that NERC is loudly rewarding the Discos for their inefficiencies. There cannot and must not be a positive correlation between poor service delivery and increased pricing that benefits the price taker.

There was a sense that Ceballos’ loan was heading in the wrong direction. There was no doubt about his quality on the ball, but was he suited to the hustle and bustle of the Premier League?


  Those are questions that have remained unanswered given his long injury lay- off. But now we might be about to find out.


  Ceballos is finally fit again and has been on the bench for the past two games, against Manchester United and Leeds. He has yet to come on, but with such a demanding schedule coming up, he should have a big part to play over the second half of the campaign.


  Of course, a lot has changed since his last appearance – which came during the 1-1 draw with Wolves in November.


  Emery, the man who played such a big role in convincing him to turn down a move to Spurs in favour of joining the Gunners in the summer, has gone and been replaced by Mikel Arteta.


  The managerial change has transformed the mood at Arsenal, who travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday having won two successive games for the first time since the start of October.


  For Ceballos, the priority now is trying to force his way back into the team. He has five months left of his loan spell and Arteta has challenged the midfielder to make life difficult for him before he returns to Madrid.


  “I know him really well from Spain,” said Arsenal’s head coach. “I watched him many, many times. He always wants the ball, he has big personality to play. I like him.


  “He is getting much closer to the fitness levels that I expect from him to be competing with his team-mates. Obviously, he had a long-term injury and he had an adaptation to this league.


  “But he is a player that can fit our style and now he needs to make a step forward and make things difficult for me and my selection. Now he is ready to step in.”

These states, Illinois being the latest, New Mexico is next, have established legal access to medical and recreational cannabis. We need to be ahead of the game or at least in the game when the Federal government finally removes cannabis from the banned list and legalizes it. It’s only a matter of time. If you look at a map of the states still holding back you’ll see that NC along with the rest of the redneck Southern or Midwest states still cling to their backwards beliefs, we need to step far away from them and be a little more progressive.

“Citizens United is enabling small groups of the very wealthy of the right and left to have undue influence over politics,” said Steve Westly, former state controller of California and an unsuccessful 2006 gubernatorial candidate who is now raising money for former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.
 These massive infusions came as the influence of money in American politics was expanding. Spending on presidential elections, for example, grew 66% from the 2000 campaign between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore to the 2016 campaign between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. At the same time, spending on congressional campaigns grew 143%.
 “The current system of campaign finance is one that is dramatically different from the one that jumps out from the pages of the statutes,” according to a report from the Bipartisan Policy Center prepared by, among others, scholars from the New York University and Stanford law schools. “The current system has been shaped by a combination of legislative, judicial, and administrative actions, and is not a system that, in its entirety, Congress ever established.”
 But the notion that the Citizens United decision opened the donation floodgates to 21st century corporations is a myth.
 The power of corporate contributions in modern times — $95 million in 2016 — is arguably about the same as it was in 1896, when businessman Mark Hanna was able to raise the 2019 equivalent of $90 million from banks and insurance companies on behalf of Republican presidential candidate William McKinley to battle the populist Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan. McKinley won.
 Not one major American corporation spent money independently in support of a candidate in 2014 and 2016. Only two smaller companies in 2014 and 10 two years later made independent expenditures, amounting to a total of $753,282.
 “Even when the expenditures reported by trade associations or other business organizations are considered,” according to the Conference Board study, “the role of business spending is relatively insignificant.”
 Students of campaign finance believe a major reason for the relatively small corporate contributions — money specifically directed to an individual campaign, as opposed to super PAC contributions — is a reluctance to alienate customers. “You want to sell soap to everybody, not just to Republicans or just to Democrats,” said Corrado, the Colby College political scientist.
