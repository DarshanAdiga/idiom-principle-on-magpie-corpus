When a franchise retains or buys a player for top dollars, there are expectations; expectations to win games and justify the money paid. Rajasthan Royals' Ben Stokes is a top-dollar cricketer who commands the price he gets. He proved that in the way he buccaneered an unbeaten hundred against a strong Mumbai Indians side on Sunday.

Holding his position from where he is prepared to pick his spots on both sides of the wicket, Hardik seems to have answers posed by the bowlers at the death. His unbeaten 60 off 21 balls propelled MI to an above par 195. With a strong bowling attack, chasing MI's target was possible only if one or two of the RR boys were to bat through the major part of 120 balls. Stokes justified his value with one of the best run chases seen in IPL-13. Innovative, picking his spots, keeping up with the run-rate and a bit of luck, Stokes scripted a clinical chase with a hundred and support from the classy Sanju Samson.

In New York City we once played a punk thrash-rock club called Tramps. All the displaced Texans in town turned out to raise hell. Almost two thousand of them. They held aloft their Lone Star longnecks that had been flown in especially for the show high above their heads and sang every word to every song. “The man in the big hat is buying …” It was intense and thrilling. Rocky, the sound man, said it was the loudest band he had ever heard in the club. “But it wasn’t your fault,” he said. “The f-ing people were singing so f-ing loud I couldn’t hear a f-ing thing youse guys were doing. So I kept turning the f-ing PA up, and up, and they would sing even f-ing louder. I couldn’t believe it! It was f-ing madness!” It was hot, sweaty, and loud in that cavern, and I always said that Jerry Jeff was the first punk rocker.

The match that will take place between both Randy and Roman should be a good one (I might be one of the few that really enjoyed their SummerSlam 2014 meeting). Roman has a new edge to him that makes him far more cold and ruthless these days, which will give him the edge over Randy. And while Randy is a sinister and conniving champion, Roman's current status presents him as someone a bit more formidable than his Raw foe. I think Randy will get desperate and cause a ref knockdown at some point that will push him to bring some weaponry into the fray. But a certain pissed off former WWE Champion will come out to disrupt Randy's plans and cause him to fall to the Universal Champion. This will set up the next PPV meeting between the two and maintain Roman's 2020 hot heel streak.

Let's be clear: I'm all for my newspaper taking a neutral stance and giving an equal voice to all sides of the political theater.
 However, I must strenuously object when I see what's essentially a retweet of the unsubstantiated story of Hunter Biden's computer in the letter by Ron Ciaccio ("Biden's corruption should be on front page of paper," The Daily News, Oct. 21). This story is being investigated by the FBI and other IC entities as Russian disinformation. Your printing someone's unproven statement as if it were fact simply furthers the conspiracy.
 I've seen some letters to the editor that were "out there," but seeing this, I felt I had to say something. This is beyond the pale.
 If The Daily News is neutral, have the integrity to put a line in the sand when people further what's essentially QAnon conspiracy.

He was a character, but not a caricature. He wasn’t a clown. Part of his character, from the beginning, was being outrageous and full tilt. But what’s also always struck me was that he made it all up, he picked it all up on his travels from New York down to Florida, and over to New Orleans. He cherrypicked all these different pieces of what he liked, what moved him. But none of it was scripted. He was a dreamer. He was willing to go all the way. He made every part of his life up and then made it real. For it to become wholly authentic? That’s magic. It’s life as theater. Once you do that, intentionally or not, your whole life becomes performance art at some level. His public life for sure. And even when I was with him privately, it’s not like he changed much.

Let’s deal with the big question first. The everyday driving range of the Leaf e+ is 300km-plus. Not according to some unrealistic test standard, but driven quite normally in the all-too-real world.We spent more than two weeks driving a Leaf e+ in the UK, covering a total of 1500km. The Nissan EV was a top-spec Tekna, so therefore had very similar standard equipment to the version that will be exported from the UK to Australia. Our biggest single day of driving used 96 per cent of the Leaf’s fully charged battery to cover 315km. The journey was a mixture of motorway, major roads, country lanes and some town centres, and the Nissan wasn’t driven for maximum energy efficiency.With its bigger battery pack and more powerful electric motor the e+ is a step up in driving range and performance from the version that’s been on sale in Australia since the middle of 2019.But the improvements come at a cost. Lithium-ion batteries are expensive things. The 62kWh battery pack of the e+ brings a 55 per cent increase in energy storage, but at a price expected to be about $10,000 more than the $53,000 drive-away of the normal Leaf. Still, a price of about $62,000 would make the Leaf e+ one of Australia’s most affordable EVs with a genuine 300km-plus driving range. The electric motor driving the Leaf e+’s front wheels through a single-speed transmission produces 160kW, a power increase of 50kW compared to the basic version. Off-the-mark acceleration is really nippy in Normal mode, despite the battery-burdened Nissan weighing 1700kg with driver on board. Selecting Eco mode blunts the responsiveness, but slightly improves driving range.Next to the driving mode selector button is the e-Pedal switch. Turn on this feature for a big increase in regenerative braking that will bring the Nissan to a complete stop without touching the brake pedal. It can be useful in slow- moving stop-and-start traffic, once you get used to the weirdness of one-pedal driving. The Leaf e+ is a faster charger. It can take up to 100kW from the newest fast DC chargers that are beginning to appear along Australia’s major routes. The current Leaf is capped at 50kW. The right kind of DC fast charger will deliver a 10 to 80 per cent recharge of the Leaf e+ in 35 minutes using the car’s CHAdeMO plug port.Home AC charging is always via the Nissan’s second Type 2 charge port and the car’s on-board 6.6kW charger. Connected to a home or workplace wallbox with an output above 6.6kW a zero to 100 per cent charge will take 10 hours. Using a normal domestic power socket instead will take 24 hours-plus (which is why a wallbox is an EV-owner must-have).The Leaf e+ is a quiet and refined drive. The motor is almost silent and never having to shift gears — there’s only one, remember — means acceleration is always smooth. Ride comfort is good, but the Nissan can become bouncy on rougher roads. The Leaf e+ is safe and predictable to drive but the steering lacks feel and the bouncy ride doesn’t encourage enthusiastic cornering. There’s ample space for four inside, or five with a slight rear-seat squeeze, and the hatchback’s cargo compartment is usefully large. Quality isn’t great, considering the high price, and some expected amenities are missing. The plastics are not premium, the steering wheel isn’t adjustable for reach and the front seats have manual adjustment. On the other hand, the Leaf e+ does come standard with high-grade infotainment and driver-assist tech. And there are some nice surprises, too, such as electric heating of both front and rear seats. The Leaf e+ highlights the problems EVs face in the Australian market, with its high-price and serious shortcomings in some areas. But that 300km-plus range removes one of the big reasons people fret about switching to an EV.Range anxiety? It just never happened during the time I spent with the Nissan Leaf e+.

The Texanist figures that over the course of the many years he has spent in this rough and tumble land, he has been on the receiving end of bites, sticks, and stings from just about every ornery creature ever to call Texas home. Or at least had run-ins with most of them. Or, at a minimum, passing encounters. Indeed, if memory serves, he has in his lifetime run afoul of, or come across in one way or another, black widows, red wasps, yellowjackets, brown recluses, green gators, funky feral hogs, brutish bulls, prickly porcupines, steely-eyed sharks, stealthy stingrays, gelatinous jellyfish, sneaky scorpions, smelly skunks, buzzing bees, slithering snakes (including rattlesnakes), coy coyotes, bawling bobcats, bloodthirsty bats (yes, crackerjack chiropterologists, the Texanist knows, but he’s on a roll here), pissed off peccaries, bossy badgers, and pallid possums. And, on occasions too numerous to count, rowdy rednecks who, after a little bottle-raising, become rowdier still. And once, while camping in South Texas many, many years ago, quite possibly a chill-inducing chupacabra.

When the Texanist asked the folks at TPWD about bear encounters that had gone wrong, they mentioned only one instance, which took place in 1934 and involved a three-year-old black bear that had been captured as a cub and turned into a Crockett County gas station sideshow attraction that eventually killed its keeper. According to wiseaboutbears.org, there have been only 67 fatalities at the hands, er, paws of black bears across all of North America since 1900. When the Texanist asked TPWD to describe a typical encounter with a bear, they put it this way: “The typical encounter involves a person seeing a bear and the bear running away.” But in the rare event that you do find yourself face to face with a bear, the experts advise talking to it in a calm manner while backing away and avoiding direct eye contact. Don’t run. If the bear does approach you, though, attempt to make yourself appear larger by raising your hands and holding something like a jacket or backpack, and yell at the bear. In the even rarer event that things turn ugly and the bear attacks, you are advised to fight back aggressively, employing rocks or sticks or whatever else is at hand. Carrying pepper spray is a good idea; a shot of that will usually do the trick.

Cops slapped public safety orders on alleged members and associates of rival families, the force announced on Tuesday. “We’ve got people dying in the streets and it’s got the stop. We’re sick of this behaviour,” Detective Superintendent Rob Critchlow told 2GB. The orders essentially amount to establishing no-go zones for alleged gang associates across southwestern Sydney, and also allow police to search them or their vehicles and houses. The orders last for 72 hours and will prevent those targeted from visiting certain places or associating with certain people. NED-2588 Hamzy's and Enemies Superintendent Critchlow told the radio program that police would next be seeking more stringent orders, which enshrine those powers for up to two years. The move comes after the high-profile killing of Mejid Hamzy, the younger brother of notorious gangster Bassam Hamzy, last week. He was gunned down at his house in an early-morning drive-by shooting that terrified neighbours and left a pool of blood at his doorstep. A car that was believed to have been used as a getaway vehicle was found burning nearby. A cousin of the brothers, Mohammed “Little Crazy” Hamzy, was subsequently stabbed in prison in an attack police think may be linked to the shooting. Police formed Strike Force Courier to investigate the murder of Mejid Hamzy in Condell Park, police said. Investigators with that squad have executed crime scene search warrants at the Simmat Avenue property where the shooting took place, as well as at another unit in the area and a home in Fairfield. The operation is conducted in conjunction with bikie taskforce Strike Force Raptor, and assisted by Operation Talon and the North-West Metropolitan Operations Support Group. The public safety orders were served at a number of locations in Sydney, including Merrylands, Greystanes, Mt Druitt, Minchinbury, San Souci, Auburn and Bronte. As those orders were issued, Raptor officers and local police from Sydney’s southwest also continued what’s referred to as a targeted execution of firearm prohibition orders. After the October 19 killing of Mejid Hamzy, police said the threat of retribution was “very real”. Police are investigating whether the killing could have been committed by another criminal group. “They are organised crime groups targeting each other,” Assistant Commissioner Peter Thurtell told reporters. Bassam Hamzy, who is serving time at Goulburn Supermax, started the Brothers 4 Life gang in 2007. That was five years after he was jailed for the 1998 shooting murder of teenager Kris Toumazis outside a nightclub in Darlinghurst. His alleged criminal activity has continued from behind bars, with multiple instances over the years where Bassam Hamzy has been accused of directing gang business and running a drug ring. Several other members of the Hamzy family have been caught up in violence, too. Bassam Hamzy’s cousin was shot dead in an attack from fellow gang members in 2013, and his aunt Maha Hamze was sprayed with bullets over a debt collection deal Bassam Hamzy had made behind bars. A year later his own mother became caught up in the violence. She was shot in the stomach through the front door of her home in Auburn. The latest instance came over the weekend when footage emerged which allegedly showed an inmate attacking Bassam Hazmy’s cousin Mohammed Hamzy inside John Morony Correctional Centre at Windsor.

Gamal Elsaied Elboushi, 52, trembled in the dock as he learned his fate for the elaborate hoax, which brought Brisbane International Airport to a standstill.The award-winning cinematographer will spend at least three years behind bars before being eligible for parole.He has already spent 633 days in pre-sentence custody.Elboushi had pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges that includef making a bomb hoax, unlawful stalking, possessing a weapon and making a false statement which can be inferred that there is a plan to damage or destroy a commonwealth air navigation facility. The court was told on Monday that Elboushi hatched the plan after his increasing frustration with the Family Court system and not being able to see his two daughters for more than a year. On February 2, 2019, he “ambushed” his family at Brisbane International Airport on February 2, 2019 and chased them through the terminal.Elboushi was carrying a large knife, a fake bomb concealed inside a suitcase, a gas mask in case authorities attempted to subdue him and a number of tools.He wore wristbands with spikes “poking out” that he claimed contained snake venom.Terrified passengers scrambled to safety as he wandered around the food court and entered a tense standoff with authorities.He surrendered about 9.30 that night after being subdued.Crown prosecutor Elizabeth Kelso said Elboushi knew his actions would cause fear and terror in the public and was not deterred by law enforcement. Mental health support “There is no apology or insight into the effect his actions have had on his wife and children,” Ms Kelso told the court on Monday, saying all three had ongoing psychological issues from the incident.His defence lawyer, Angus Edwards, said Elboushi’s actions were “a cry for help” amid his ongoing emotional turmoil but they were not “malicious”.Judge Suzanne Sheridan sentenced him to six years’ jail with a non-parole period of three years.She said Elboushi’s actions had a serious impact on his wife and daughters and had cost the airport more than $1 million in operational costs.“Your actions that day caused mass panic,” Judge Sheridan told Elboushi.“No sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate in the circumstances.“You exposed police officers … to a highly dangerous and distressing situation with potentially catastrophic outcomes.”“Your conduct was criminally appalling behaviour, it’s impact was very far reaching.” Domestic Violence helplines Judge Sheridan said his apology needed to be considered in context as he made reference to “the inadequacy of the security system at the airport” immediately after.She took into account his mental health issues and how his thinking was “not insightful” at the time.“You were clearly distressed you could not see your children … it is important you understand the culture you now live in,” Judge Sheridan said.
