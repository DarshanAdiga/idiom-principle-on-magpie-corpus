On the face of it, opposing war, the extinction of the human race and racism are sensible positions to take. In the case of Stop The War, an organisation set up, and still run, by the revolutionary Marxist sect, the Socialist Workers’ Party (SWP), the scales have long fallen from most politicians’ eyes: only the most extreme Labour MPs still associate themselves publicly with an organisation that has never knowingly criticised any of Russia’s annexations, invasions or chemical weapons attacks but is vocal in its opposition to America, Britain and, of course, Israel.

 Joleen Corr, 27, was attacked in Downpatrick, County Down, in December 2016 and was left needing 24-hour care.
 On Thursday, her former partner Michael O'Connor, 34, appeared at Downpatrick Crown Court via videolink from prison.
 He clapped and rubbed his hands together at the end of the hearing.

In summary, people of color experience both more likely exposure to COVID-19 and increased complications from it. But let me be crystal clear: We do not think people of color are biologically or genetically predisposed to get COVID-19. There is nothing inherently wrong with you.

The Foreign Secretary’s clear affirmation of our commitment to the people of Hong Kong, and his announcement that we will proceed with changing the immigration arrangements for those holding BN(O) status, are therefore to be most warmly welcomed. The Government is right to say that the UK cannot look the other way on Hong Kong, and to prove that we will not duck our historic responsibilities to its people.
