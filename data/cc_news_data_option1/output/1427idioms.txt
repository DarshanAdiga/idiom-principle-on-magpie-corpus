A love letter
 Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a spectacle, easily one of the best-looking games I've ever played. But the man hours that went into it are evident beyond its technical prowess. It's not just how visually arresting the game is: The environments, from the neon Wall Market red light district to the sterile Mako reactors, are dense with detail and feel like they live and breathe.
 The cynic in me suspects Square Enix is splitting the game into multiple parts so they can enjoy multiple paydays. But it's hard to care when the first entry is so carefully and lovingly made.
 Like all major Final Fantasy releases, this game launches with questions about its legacy. Does it do justice to the original? Is it as good as previous groundbreaking games in the franchise? Was it worth the 15 year wait? The first two questions can only be answered in the coming years, depending largely on how well subsequent parts are crafted. The third question is a hard yes.
 New or old fan, Final Fantasy 7 Remake is worth your $60 and then some.

SOLVANG, Calif. (KEYT/CNN) - What started off as a small token of gratitude evolved into more than 500 cases of wine donated to medical facilities along the California coast. It began with a request for one case of wine to thank front line COVID-19 medical workers at a local hospital."My son drew on every bottle of wine little hearts and put a couple of nice notes in there,” Michael Speakman of Westerly Wines said. From the request, a sweeping donation plan emerged. The Santa Barbara County wine community poured itself into the project without hesitation. “We had people dropping off wine left and right. Twenty cases, 10 cases, five cases, one case,” Speakman said. “It’s pretty remarkable, amazing how our wine community came together in such a fast way. And they’re just all excited and happy to help out.”In just three days, more than 500 cases of wine were donated. Even U-Haul joined the cause, donating vans to help transport the cases. The cases will be dropped off at medical facilities from Santa Barbara, California to San Diego. "They are giving it to the front line first responders, nurses, doctors and all the people that are on the front line of this virus,” Speakman said. Each bottle was personally handled and tagged with a message of thanks from the wine community. Winemakers at all levels were part of the shipment as local wine industry and close friends help pack the cases. Vintners also invited the recipients to come up when the crisis is over.Copyright 2020 KEYT via CNN. All rights reserved.

Thibaut Courtois is not certain to be an automatic starter at Real Madrid with Julen Lopetegui suggesting his goalkeepers could be regularly rotated. Incumbent number one Keylor Navas held his place in the 4-2 loss to Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup while Courtois, who travelled to Tallinn, was left out of the squad entirely. The Belgium international had been expected to slot straight in after arriving from Chelsea for a reported €39million, but the position remains up for grabs…

“Honestly, I think the distinction between left and right tackle is really outdated,” he said. “We are no longer in the days of football where teams will have their best rusher and line him up on the defensive right side and offensive left side of the formation. Really, the game is not played that way. From my perspective, tackles are tackles.”

As a result, they discovered a completely new mechanism, possibly able to shed light on previously unexplained observations.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The plan was for South Carolina lawmakers to meet Wednesday, get their business done in an hour or two and head home until at least the summer, when hopefully the coronavirus crisis was past.Instead, that old entanglement Santee Cooper popped up again. The typical annoyance between the House and Senate turned to anger. Sniping statements and speeches were exchanged.And now at least one of the chambers will have to return before July 1 and pass a bill allowing the state to continue operating without a budget or South Carolina will shut down.“Today’s vote in the Senate is a shameless abdication of leadership,” House Speaker Jay Lucas texted even before the final vote was cast in the Senate to change the continuing resolution, or CR, so the Legislature’s work would not be done Wednesday.Senate President Harvey Peeler sent an email to his colleagues Thursday saying it is up to the House to finish the job. Then he posted to Twitter on Friday.“South Carolina will be better served if we spend more time on the CR and less time on the PR,” Peeler posted.A letter Thursday could raise the stakes higher. House leaders demanded Santee Cooper turn over all emails its employees and board members sent in the past 45 days to not just House members, but senators too. The letter also asks for telephone, cellphone and text records between Santee Cooper and all legislators.Wednesday’s unfinished business leaves lawmakers with several choices. Pass nothing and let the state shut down seems inconceivable. The likeliest scenario is the House returns. It can pass what the Senate passed or change it again and put the ball back in the Senate’s court. Or both sides could let the May 14 adjournment date pass and leave it to the governor to call a special session.At issue is the fate of Santee Cooper. Lawmakers have been studying whether to sell or reform the state-owned utility since it took on $4 billion in debt in the last decade for a minority stake in a pair of nuclear reactors that never generated power.The bill to allow state government to keep spending included a section to extend the law allowing the state to sell or reform the utility to be extended into 2021. House leaders said Senate leaders agreed to a provision preventing Santee Cooper from entering into any contracts over a year in length, but suddenly that became an issue 36 hours before Wednesday’s session.“They had a few senators and I emphasize a few that would not go along with that and that would hold it up,” said Republican Rep. Murrell Smith of Sumter.The House then passed the bill and adjourned in a little over an hour. Several senators were offended, saying the House intentionally put them in a corner with the unnecessary provision during a crisis so they would look bad if they opposed the emergency proposal.“This is politics at its worst. Look around. You have gloves on. You have masks on. We’re being asked to take our masks down and swallow something that they tweaked a little bit then left,” said Republican Sen. Luke Rankin of Horry County.Things then got more tense. The Senate voted to alter the bill, requiring Santee Cooper to get permission from the governor, speaker, Senate president and budget committee chairmen from both chambers before signing contracts of a year or more.Four of the most powerful House members then sent statements blasting senators.“The Senate chose to protect a rogue state agency rather than teachers and first responders today,” Smith said.After the Senate adjourned, Majority Leader Shane Massey was read the statements. As he slathered his hands in sanitizer, he shook his head a little and said he wasn’t going to comment.The back and forth left senators who aren’t as passionate about Santee Cooper perplexed.“Santee Cooper cannot be let off the hook on this. The House can’t continue to do these type of things. I’m offended by the timing,” said Republican Sen. Sean Bennett of Summerville.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
