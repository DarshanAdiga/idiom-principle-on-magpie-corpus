Law360 (December 17, 2020, 7:40 PM EST) -- President-elect Joe Biden can most effectively tip the scales of workplace power in workers' favor by barring businesses that violate federal labor law from taking on federal contracts, the AFL-CIO's chief economist said Thursday at a panel on strengthening collective bargaining.      Making businesses that violate the National Labor Relations Act forgo a share of the hundreds of billions of dollars per year the federal government doles out to federal contractors is the top move Biden could make to aid organized labor, William Spriggs told moderator Lynn Rhinehart, an Economic Policy Institute senior fellow and a member of the team guiding the...

Speaking at the launch of the publication in Lagos recently, the National President, Environmental Health Officers Association of Nigeria, Dr. Samuel Akinghehin, stated that the publication highlighted the significance of the pest- control industry to the socio-economic development of the country by presenting a multidimensional approach to pest control and management. “The book is designed to denounce the parochial understanding of the Industry among the populace, underscoring the growth that the sector has witnessed over the years and its relevance to sustainable environment,” he stated. While reviewing the book, Dr. Akingbehin posited that government and private sector could explore the sector to create employment opportunities while intending enterpreneurs can also avail themselves the knowledge provided by the book to create a carrier path and grow the sector.

Having grown up in the region, I'm no stranger to snowy winters, or shoveling. When my wife and I finally bought our first home years ago, one of my first purchases was a snowblower, and it worked well enough. But these days we're on house number two with a much longer driveway, and even with a bigger snowblower, it still takes up to two hours for cleanup after a dump. During one of those storms a couple of years ago, watching my neighbor clear his asphalt with his New York Giants-themed golf cart and a mini plow, I started fantasizing about a way to use one of our Subarus for the same task. If Tom could mount a plow to a golf cart, why couldn’t I put one on an Outback without chopping it up?
 I hit the internet to search for a suitable car plow. Slogging through some questionable DIY plywood creations on YouTube, I ended up finding the perfect solution, one that works so well on your average suburban driveway that I'm not quite sure how it hasn't blown up yet. Agri-Cover, a North Dakota company that manufacturers pickup tonneau covers, also makes a line of self-adjusting aluminum utility plows that don't require in-cabin controls. And the aptly- named SnowSport 180 is designed to work on the back of just about any vehicle with a standard 2-inch receiver hitch.

They have also, by this dint of hard work, succeeded in climbing to the highest reaches of such outfits. These women, however, are among the few who were privileged to have been highly educated and exposed to opportunities that got them to where they are today, leaving the majority of the non-educated petty entrepreneurs to struggle daily to make ends meet. Some of such women are Hajiya Bola Shagaya, an oil and real estate magnate, Uju Ifejika, and arguably the most prominent of them all, 65-yearold Folorunsho Alakija, who found her fame and fortune in the oil and fashion industries.

Law360 (December 17, 2020, 5:20 PM EST) -- Wells Fargo customers suing the bank in five suits in multidistrict litigation over deceptive overdraft fees asked the Eleventh Circuit on Thursday to reverse an order sending the claims to arbitration, arguing that the wording of their contracts calls for commercial dispute resolution to consumer claims.      In oral arguments before two judges of a three-judge panel via videoconference, plaintiffs' attorney Bruce Rogow told the court that the arbitration clause in the customers' contracts sends them to arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's commercial dispute resolution rules.

Law360 (December 17, 2020, 7:00 PM EST) -- An immigration judges' union urged the Fourth Circuit Wednesday to block the DOJ's prior restraint policy prohibiting them from speaking publicly about immigration, arguing their constitutional claims must be resolved by federal courts and not administratively, and that the claims aren't impacted by the union's collective bargaining status.      In a 34-page brief, the National Association of Immigration Judges slammed the U.S. Department of Justice's argument that the union doesn't have standing to pursue free speech claims on behalf of immigration judges in light of the Federal Labor Relations Authority's recent decision to decertify the union's collective bargaining status. The union said...

All told however, the problem of COVID- 19 has impacted rather heavily on Nigerian women, especially the rural dwellers, and just made their efforts to make ends meet more onerous. It is therefore unimaginable that social distancing, as prescribed by the experts as an essential method to contain the COVID-19, could be practiced here by majority of Nigerian women entrepreneurs.

But they know how far revenue from such efforts goes in supplementing what the men bring home at the end of the day. There are also other market settings which are generally dominated by women. These markets vary in size – from just a cluster of a few roughly constructed huts, to extremely large, well- organised and thriving markets that play host to thousands of traders, the majority of them, women. Let us not forget also the working class women that abound in the civil service and in private concerns.

The firearm was processed through the National Crime Information Center and came back as stolen out of New Castle County in Delaware, according to the release. Grasty was charged with firearms violations and related charges, and is being held at the county prison in Concord in lieu of $250,000 cash bail.
 The third arrest took place about 7 p.m., when Shaughnessy was in the area of 18th Street and Providence Avenue on patrol. Shaughnessy allegedly saw a 2010 maroon Chevrolet Camaro traveling in reverse down a one way street on East 18th Street and attempted to conduct a vehicle stop.
 The Chevrolet failed to stop and traveled southbound on Edgemont Avenue, according to the release, getting onto I-95 southbound while almost striking several vehicles.
 The driver, later identified as Jorge Alvardo-Gonzalez, 24, exited on Highland Avenue and fled on foot from the vehicle, according to the release. Shaughnessy stayed with the Chevrolet and recovered a black Ruger 57 on the driver side floor board of the vehicle, the release says.
 Officer Michael Spicer meanwhile placed Alvardo-Gonzalez into custody after a brief foot pursuit, according to the release. The firearm contained one live bullet in the chamber and 17 live bullets in the magazine, the release says.
 Also allegedly recovered from the vehicle were a handheld police scanner, four zip-top bags containing suspected marijuana, a clear sandwich bag containing nine white pills stamped “K-18,” a clear sandwich bag containing (30) pink pills stamped “K-56,” $681 in cash and two clear sandwich bags containing suspected cocaine. Shaughnessy conducted field tests and received positive reaction for the respective substances, according to the release.
 Alvardo-Gonzalez is charged with firearms violations and related charges, and is currently in custody at the county prison pending $100,000 cash bail.

Much of the northeastern United States spent today digging out from the aftermath of this week's major pre-Christmas winter storm, which dumped over three feet of snow across a large swath of interior Pennsylvania and New York and slightly less spectacular amounts from the Virginia to southern Maine. About nine inches fell in my little corner of western Connecticut, to be exact.
 But I didn't mind. In fact, I was excited. Not because everything looks all festive now, but because it gave me an excuse to bust out one of my favorite tools: a trailer hitch snowplow that makes short work of my long driveway while I'm toasty warm in the driver's seat of my Subaru Outback.

We have been taught that such confining measures are necessary to contain inflation. However, they have not been successful in containing inflation and in the long term probably add to inflation. What they have been is terribly efficient at is reducing growth, jobs and development and bringing recurrent recession.
