But GM says it had been proceeding on the same course all along.

The prolonged lockdown has brought along with it health concerns of a different nature for those remaining indoors.
 Many in distress have been calling health experts to seek solutions.
 “Ever since the lockdown was announced, a lot of people, including those with a history of back and neck pain, have been contacting us. Most of them have lower back pain, tail bone pain, neck pain with stiffness, cramps, knee pain and even vertigo,” said Tiji Mathew Thomas, a city-based physiotherapist.
 “Most of the pain is caused by bad posture. Those working with laptops should keep the upper one-third of the monitor at eye level and use a separate keyboard and mouse at their forearm level, like when they are using a desktop. Sit with the back leaning against the chair back and the curve over the lower back supported on a rolled towel or cushion, with ears at the level of shoulders,” he said.
 N.S.D Raju, senior ophthalmologist, advised people working from home to reduce the brightness of the screen. “The eyes get strained as we stare at the digital display of mobile phones, television and computer screens for long. Always read or watch in a well-lit room. Focusing on a distant outdoor object through the window helps relax the iris muscles. Ensure that you get adequate sleep of at least eight hours,” he said.
 Pulmonologist Zone Xavier Thaliath suggested doing breathing exercises to maintain the vital capacity of lungs and to ensure good oxygen levels. “Those already on medication for various ailments should continue taking the medicines. Physical activities like walking will help in managing stress. Proper hydration should also be ensured,” he said.
 Mr. Thomas had a word of caution to those glued to the television for extended hours. “Sit in front with knees bent and feet on the floor. Never watch television with the neck rotated to one side. Do not sit with the tail bone taking the full load and legs crossed and stretched forward. Instead, the thigh or the back of the knee should be supported. Otherwise, the knees will hang and this strains the ligaments and structures over the back of the knee,” he said.
 Experts warned against reading and using laptop in bed with two or more pillows stacked over. If you are sleeping on the sides, the pillow should have enough height to keep the neck in line with the spine, they said.

Lynch, meanwhile, was experimenting in his garage, which he had made into an artist’s studio, full of drums of white silicon plastic. Jonathan Sanger, The Elephant Man’s producer, only saw Lynch’s creation on the day Hurt finally arrived from the set of Heaven’s Gate, with just two weeks before shooting began. Against Lynch’s wishes, he accompanied the actor to the director’s home to try on the make-or-break prosthetics.

The pair had met before, most probably Tucker thinks, working on one of the period television dramas he did make-up for before The Elephant Man. But eight weeks in a small studio will either make or break a friendship. “We got on as if we were brothers, it was very straightforward,” Tucker says. Hurt, for the most part, was well-behaved, although Tucker recalled, with a laugh, that “when we did the torso cast down to his waist, he had far too much to drink and he kept falling asleep. He would be working with us most of the time. We went through his lines, and talked and talked.”

CALIFORNIA, USA — A California scientist and his team say they have found a potential cure for COVID-19.
 News 8 introduced you to Dr. Jacob Glanville of Distributed Bio a couple of weeks ago. He's one of the doctors featured in the Netflix show "Pandemic." His team in the Bay Area has been working around the clock trying to come up with a drug to treat COVID-19. Monday he announced he believes they've found one.

While Sanger had a shortlist of three men who could fit the bill (only one of whom, Star Wars creature artist Stuart Freeborn, was based in the UK), Tucker was not on it. Instead, he came through a recommendation from the Star Wars make-up department. When Sanger and production manager Terence Clegg arrived on the doorstep of Tucker’s tiny basement studio on the Old Kent Road (“one of my colleagues called it the grotto”, he recalled), however, Tucker was unfazed: “I’m only surprised it took you this long to come to me. I’m one of very few people who can do this”, he announced – much to the filmmakers’ umbrage. “Terry took an instant dislike to him,” Sanger wrote.

While the old clean car standards required an average 5 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions annually from cars and light truck fleets, the Trump administration's version, called the Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient Vehicles, requires just 1.5 percent. It would keep the US lagging behind most of the world in its fuel efficiency requirements. Most of the domestic auto industry isn't even on board with the Trump administration's rule, saying it would cause more instability and would even cost the economy 60,000 jobs.

“They insured me for 2 million quid. They obviously thought I might be run over by a bus. Fat chance of that– I never even got out the door!” Tucker told The Telegraph. “The longest day we did, working non-stop, was 49 hours. Forty- nine hours without going to bed. We saw the milkman no less that three times. The second time, he couldn’t believe we were still working. The third time it got a bit ruder than that. It was a really hard slog, everything but everything hinged upon the make-up.”

The Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) has adopted various steps to support society in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19.
 The university would provide four Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction machines to the Health Department for diagnosis purpose. All its hostels and other facilities on various campuses would be given for accommodating those under observation, M.R. Saseendranath, Vice Chancellor, KVASU, told _The Hindu_.
 The dairy plant of the varsity has been functioning round the clock to supply milk to the public through its sales outlet at Mannuthy in Thrissur. Meat and eggs are are also being sold through the varsity outlets.

The case of Matt Puempel is one that has baffled me. He was acquired by Detroit in 2017 in exchange for Ryan Sproul and then signed in 2018 to a two- year contract with Detroit.

Karen and Ross McGarvie’s COVID-19 ordeal on the Costa Victoria comes to a teary end

Romer and Garber advocate that the federal government mobilize the nation like it's a war and implement measures that might allow us to reenter a somewhat normally functioning economy without massive loss of life.
 As others have been advocating, they want the government to make COVID-19 tests universally available, done frequently, and used as a green light for each of us to reenter economic and social life. The problem, Romer says, is there are only about a hundred testing machines in the U.S. and we need at least 5,000 of them. And that "isn't going to happen if we just sit around and pray and hope," he says. He thinks it's going to require massive government funding and centralized direction. He envisions government-sponsored testing sites throughout the country.
 Romer and Garber also want mass production of face masks, gloves, full-body suits, hand sanitizer, ventilators, and everything it takes to make it safer for social interaction. "It's just a tragedy that we don't have enough masks and face shields – and god help us – we may not even have enough gloves soon for people to do their work at the hospital," Romer says.
 Economists usually like it when the market provides solutions. But building factories, buying machines, training workers, and doing everything else it takes to produce massive quantities of medical equipment on an aggressively short timeline will cost a lot. And, Romer says, without government intervention, companies won't do this on their own.
 That's because corporate America naturally worries that demand for this equipment will evaporate once the crisis recedes and that even during the crisis, they might not be able to charge much for it. With historically high demand and limited supply, the market's natural response is sky-high prices. Everybody hates them, but high prices provide an incentive for manufacturers to produce. Yet, Romer says, "the reality is our political system, our emotions, will not let companies charge like ten times as much for the masks right now as we're trying to get a surge in production. So that's why the market can't do its job. We won't let prices do what they have to do."
 With corporate America caught between a short demand spike and price controls, Romer and Garber want the federal government to step in and do whatever it takes to increase the production of testing machines and protective equipment. Romer compares it to what the government did after Pearl Harbor.
 But he's frustrated by what he sees as a lack of aggressiveness in tackling the threat. Washington recently passed a $2 trillion coronavirus response package aimed primarily at helping Americans as COVID-19 and social distancing shut down our economy. The bill includes about $180 billion for health-related efforts, including $16 billion for more medical equipment. It's not enough, Romer says. He wants the government to spend about $100 billion on medical equipment and allocate additional funds for testing sites and staff.
 "I mean, the investments we're advocating here, they're not inconceivable," Romer says. "This isn't like John Kennedy saying, 'We're gonna to to the moon.'"

She told Variety Live: "It was just an outburst. That was not well-handled. I'm just human and I snapped! If I could go back I would have done it at a different time. I don't know when it's ever really appropriate, but that was not the best time."
 However, the actress admitted it was "nice" to have being queer "off her chest" when she detailed her internal struggle with her sexuality.
 Jameela said she kept it hidden for so long because she doesn't like her love life under the microscope.
