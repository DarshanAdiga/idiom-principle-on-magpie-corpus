London, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 27th Jan, 2020 ):Global stock markets and oil prices plunged Monday as panicked investors bolted into safer assets such as gold after China warned that the spread of a deadly new coronavirus was accelerating.
 China extended its traditional Lunar New Year holidays to buy time in the fight against the epidemic, prompting neighbouring Mongolia to close its border after the death toll spiked to 81 despite unprecedented quarantine measures.
 Fears of a repeat of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which also began in China, spooked investors who only recently pushed markets to record highs -- meaning there was plenty of room for a reverse.
 All sectors were hit but luxury goods makers and airlines suffered particularly as Chinese tourist spending is a key factor for them.
 Wall Street opened lower, quickly losing nearly two percent as the global sell-off continued, adding to the pressure on Europe.
 In mid-afternoon trade in Europe, London was down some 2.2 percent, with Paris and Frankfurt doing even worse with losses of some 2.6 percent each.
 Oil prices were down around 2.5 percent, coming off early lows hit on concerns over demand from the world's top energy consumer China.
 \- 'Major panic' - "Market participants in Europe have grave concerns about coronavirus," said Ava Trade analyst Naeem Aslam.
 "The bottom line is that the virus has become deadly and it has caused a major panic in markets." Chinese President Xi Jinping warned over the weekend that China was facing a "grave situation" given the "accelerating spread" of the new SARS-like virus that has infected nearly 3,000 people across the country.
 Analysts said there were growing fears the crisis could become as bad as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that hammered markets and the global economy in 2003.
 "Coronavirus fears have gripped the markets... as all the major European equity benchmarks are nursing big losses," said analyst David Madden at trading firm CMC Markets UK.
 "Stocks that are connected to China are feeling the pain... as traders are afraid the health crisis will curtail economic activity.

A cat "banned" from entering his favourite supermarket is up to his old tricks after being seen lounging on the self-service checkouts.
 Ginger tom Pumpkin became an "unexpected item in the bagging area" of the Norwich Tesco branch when he was spotted on the scanner on Sunday.
 Almost 2,000 people follow the adventures of the mischievous moggy, who usually abides by the ban and stays outside the front door.
 Tesco said it would encourage him out.
 The six-year-old cat had been a regular in the Thorpe Marriott branch for well over a year before the shop took action last November, saying "although we love the little ginger cat who visits... a food store isn't the best place for a cat to be, so our colleagues gently encourage him to go out when he tries to come in".

Had Johnson been removed from office, he would have been temporarily succeeded by Benjamin Wade, the Senate president and a radical Republican disliked by more conservative Republicans. Behind the scenes, Johnson and his allies worked to assure senators that if they voted to acquit him, he would stop interfering in Reconstruction. That was the very concern that led to Johnson's impeachment in the first place. And there's some agreement among historians that the senator who cast the deciding vote against impeachment was bribed.

Diggery and Doo, both female emus, live at the Utica Zoo.
   
 So do a small mob of Bennett's wallabies: Janet and her joey Yapa, Chrissy and her joey Djalu, and Dexter.
   
 They live on the other side of the world from the bushfires that have destroyed huge swathes of habitat and killed an estimated half a billion animals, including emus and wallabies, in their native Australia.
   
 But in today's world of cooperative conservation and species survival plans, Utica and the bush aren't as far apart as they seem.
   
 As a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, part of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the Utica Zoo stands prepared to work with other zoos around the world to protect Australia's unique fauna, Executive Director Andria Heath said.
   
 "With the Australia wildfires, AZA members, like Utica Zoo, are helping to raise awareness and funds to help with the wildlife recovery efforts there," said AZA spokesman Rob Vernon in an email. "Additionally, some AZA members are sending staff to help on the ground, and others participate in animal programs to help keep populations of endangered Australian animals alive by caring for them at their zoos. Many are predicting the impact of the wild fires on Australian wildlife to be catastrophic, and I am certain AZA-accredited facilities will be part of the solution to help those wild populations recover."
   
 It's even within the realm of possibility that the offspring of one of the zoo's emus or wallabies could be sent to Australia to repopulate the bush someday, Heath said.
   
 Protecting species is the primary purpose of zoos and aquariums, she said.
   
 "The animals in our zoo are the ambassadors of their counterparts in the wild," Heath said.
   
 The zoo will soon have some more ambassadors for Australian wildlife. Two laughing kookaburras have arrived at the zoo and will go on exhibit after they come out of quarantine, Heath said.
   
 Down the road, they'll join Diggery, Doo and all the wallabies, as well as black swans who live at the zoo in warm weather, in a planned Australian exhibit, she said.
   
 But inter-zoo cooperation extends far beyond the crisis in Australia, Heath said. Zoos are ready to help out with wildlife crises all over the world, she said. Although it's not talked about as often, the California wildfires are also taking a huge toll on wildlife, killing animals and destroying habitat, she said.
   
 The AZA has almost 500 species survival plans -- which determine the breeding program at the Utica Zoo for covered animals -- and a Saving Animals From Extinction, or SAFE, program to encourage inter-zoo cooperation for certain endangered species. It added North American songbirds and monarch butterflies to the list this year, Heath said.
   
 "And that's right here in our backyard," she said.
   
 At the moment, none of the Australian species in the Utica Zoo are listed as endangered. But the zoo does have animals from critically endangered species, including cotton-top tamarins and three Visayan warty pigs, and from endangered species like golden lion tamarins.
   
 And those zoo residents could, just possibly, end up helping to ensure that their species' family tree lives on.

The most oddball moment on this list, ‘Saturday Night’ is a delightfully off- kilter rock song with an infectious hook, that will get stuck in your head for days on end. Ostensibly a song about the aftermath of a Saturday night out in Kings Cross, it has also (quite reasonably) been interpreted as being Walker’s metaphorical ‘goodbye’ to the chaos of life in Cold Chisel. _Twentieth Century_ is an album recorded by a burnt-out band, yet, it features some of their finest songs and most obtuse ideas and ‘Saturday Night’ is the quintessential example of that weirdness. Loneliness and longing has never sounded so invigorating as it does here, with Phil Small’s bassline laying the grounding for the vocal tandem of Moss and Barnes to dazzle with. Moss’ verse vocals give the song a Police-esque vibe and Barnes; rock outbursts ensure you don’t forget that it’s Cold Chisel. There’s some awesome saxophone from a local busker, some crowd noise from an actual Saturday night in Kings Cross, and pretty much anything else they could think of. The weirdest Cold Chisel hit ever.

The area around the former Reese Air Force Base was one of eight locations chosen in the country for an upcoming PFAS exposure assessment.
   
 Residents in the targeted area east of the former base are being asked to participate in a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).
   
 The residents will have their blood and urine tested, and will fill out questionnaires related to water and other potential means of exposure. Environmental samples will also be taken from some participants' households.
   
 What the study hopes to learn is the levels of PFAS - an abbreviation for several man made chemicals - found in the blood and urine of people who drank the water containing the chemical, as well as the range of PFAS levels in the tested community and the environmental factors that might affect PFAS levels.
   
 This information should be made public in several years.
   
 What local residents won't learn from this study is if PFAS levels in someone's blood or urine can make them sick or if a health condition was caused by PFAS exposure. Members of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry say the actual health impact is being studied elsewhere, and will be further studied further down the road.
   
 However the results from those studies won't come out for many more years.
   
 "The march of science takes time, unfortunately," Christopher Rey, Associate Director at ATSDR, told the group of citizens living around Reese. "We at ATSDR feel a sense of urgency. We work with communities every day, we hear it from you. People want to know, have I been exposed, what's my exposure level, and is this going to cause me health problems in the future? We're working to answer those questions. But the march of science takes time."
   
 Residents around the base gathered in the cafeteria at Terra Vista Middle School Wednesday evening to hear about the exposure assessment. There was a table for volunteers to sign up, and a constant line of people waited to do so.
   
 Rey said the turnout in Lubbock was the highest he'd seen so far. There's been several public meetings hosted by the U.S. Air Force for residents around Reese to be updated on their water situation, and residents have always wanted answers about health concerns.
   
 The community talks of neighbors dying young, animals getting sick for no reason and doctors saying they have the health of someone twice their age. Residents only theorize that it's linked to PFAS levels.
   
 According to previous stories in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, the Air Force previously stated that groundwater at sites around the former Reese Air Force Base were found to have high levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, often referred to as PFAS, contained in a foam used since 1970 by the Air Force to extinguish fires.
   
 PFAS are man-made chemicals that resist heat, water and oil. The chemical is used in some household items such as nonstick pots and pans and stain- resistant carpets and fabrics, and large quantities seeped into the groundwater after years of use.
   
 Rey said almost everyone has some PFAS in their body because of household items, the concern is just how much.
   
 The Air Force has installed water treatment systems in the households in the tested area and have given out bottled water, but the levels of exposure and the health impact hasn't been fully studied.
   
 Rachel Rogers, an environmental health scientist who leads ATSDR's work on PFAS, said potential health effects aren't well understood. But she said there is evidence that PFAS could impact health.
   
 Rogers said at the meeting that animals exposed to high levels of PFAS have shown changes in the function of their liver, thyroid and pancreas. In humans, she said studies have shown PFAS exposure could interfere with the body's hormones, increase cholesterol, impact the immune system and increase the risk of some cancers.
   
 "More research in this area is needed," Rogers said. "It's needed to help scientists fully understand how PFAS affect human health... This study is an incredibly important first step in that direction."
   
 She said the challenge is there are different types of PFAS chemicals, and only a small amount have been studied at all.
   
 ATSDR is looking for hundreds of participants in this study. When it's complete, individual results will be sent to participants and ATSDR will complete a full analysis describing its findings.
   
 Only individuals living in the sampling area and using groundwater will be in the study. Nobody getting water from the City of Lubbock will be in the study since the city has different water sources.
   
 Citizens living in the targeted area, but who didn't attend the meeting last week, will be contacted by ATSDR.

Constructionism is the sort of singular and simplistic idea that would appeal to a TED audience. As Ames makes clear, its roots lay in MIT’s “hacker culture” of the 1960s and 1970s. It was based on notions of discovery-oriented learning. Students were to work hands-on with actual objects — Papert was obsessed with gears, for example. This would benefit them far more than traditional pedagogical models, he said. Exploration and creative expression were key, and so Papert argued for their needing “free contact” with computers as “objects-to-think-with.” One can see shades of these ideas today in ongoing demands that kids should and must learn to code, as well as in various plans to place tablets and other electronic devices in the hands of schoolkids everywhere.

The XPower system, which attaches to a tractor, kills plants in less than a second by pulsing electricity through them to destroy the vascular bundles that transport water and nutrients.
 "Electricity has no residues, a low risk of erosion and a high efficiency because we can control the whole plant in a systemic way - all of the plant, including the roots," says Mr Vialon.
 "We can destroy any plant. The only plant we cannot destroy is a tree."
 Meanwhile, a new device created by the University of Melbourne and spun off into a company called Growave is undergoing trials in Victoria.
 Just as a domestic microwave warms food, so the microwaves emitted by the Growave system heat up the water molecules within weeds and cause them to vibrate. This ruptures the cell walls, killing the plant.
 Meanwhile, microwaves can also heat the soil, killing weed seeds as they lie.
 "Early data is demonstrating that using the Growave technology will be as cost-effective and potentially less expensive than current approaches to weed management," says Paul Barrett, head of physical sciences of investment firm IP Group.
 "The Growave approach also has the benefit that it is not influenced by the elements and can be used when it rains, when it's windy or even at night - conditions which are not possible with traditional herbicide-spraying approaches."

So that's kind of the first driver, the Controller also integrates application centric design which really is targeted at more of the enterprise users including what we call Super-NetOps users in large enterprises. And so it does, it does gives an ability for the NetOps people to still have visibility of what goes on in the infrastructure under their applications and the DevOps people to have a self service model to deploy their applications faster and make changes for applications very quickly. So we at the time of the acquisitions, we said that F5 and NGINX together we're going to bridge the divide between NetOps and DevOps and the Controller holds really the manifestation of that strategy, and it's really the first offer in the markets that truly bridges the divide, and allow these two communities to work in concert serving the needs for speed of DevOps and serving the needs for visibility and compliance from the NetOps people. This Controller will indeed integrate in a technological Beacon, which will give visibility and analytics across all F5 environments, NGINX, Big IP, and other environments. So that's the convergence. We think this is a very important launch for our NGINX business because in addition to the capabilities around DevOps and bridging the divide, it also does increase the deal size for NGINX products because it makes large scale deployments easier and it offer new and exciting capabilities for a number of open source users that may want to move up a tier and use the Controller as a commercial technology.

What’s the source of those cattle? “It’s important to know the history of animals, including previous vaccinations and disease incidence, before they come on to your operation,” said Irons.


  Are they being handled properly? Stress is known to suppress the immune system, resulting in a greater incidence and severity of respiratory disease. Proper cattle handling is a key aspect of managing stress.


  Are we providing adequate nutrition? A solid nutrition program that includes adequate protein, energy, trace minerals and plenty of water will help an animal’s immune system work properly and fight disease.


  Is there a respiratory vaccine program in place? “If I could get all producers to implement one change to fight BRD, it would be including a modified-live, five-way vaccine,” Irons said. “If we can get that vaccine implemented consistently at the cow-calf stage, that’s five fewer viruses we have to worry about in an outbreak of BRD.”


  Are we running diagnostics? Finding the specific cause of BRD can ensure we’re implementing the correct vaccination and treatment protocols. Diagnostics could include conducting a necropsy or performing a deep nasopharyngeal swab on live calves with the guidance of a veterinarian.


  Is metaphylaxis treatment being practiced appropriately? “If you’re using metaphylaxis, it’s important to get the timing right and find a broad-spectrum antibiotic that works quickly and has a long duration of activity,” said Cummings. “Your veterinarian is your best resource for antibiotic recommendations to control BRD on arrival.”


  Are we testing incoming calves and pregnant animals for bovine viral diarrhea virus? BVDV causes immunosuppression and increases the risk of BRD. When purchasing animals, there’s a chance that they are persistently infected with BVDV. “A PI animal is similar to a Typhoid Mary; they appear normal and healthy, but they’re actually shedding BVDV onto the rest of the group,” explained Cummings. “That’s why testing and removing those animals is an imperative biosecurity measure to control BVDV.”

House Bill 1445, passed by the Texas Legislature in 2001, required cities and counties to create written agreements on who regulates developers wanting to build within the extraterritorial jurisdiction. The law was passed at the urging of developers who felt overburdened by having to follow two sets of regulations. Either counties or cities should regulate the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the law says, or they could regulate jointly.
 The current agreement requires developers to build under the city’s code, which is thought of to be more stringent than the county’s.
 “The current agreement would have been OK prior to the annexation,” Commissioner Ronnie White (Pct. 2) said. “However, now we are at a point to where the city won’t be annexing much anymore. We need to know where we stand as to which regulations we will be using.”
 Walker County is currently undergoing a “large-scale” update of is subdivision regulations. According to county planner Andy Isbell, the largest change in the proposed regulations is the distinction between rural and suburban subdivisions.
 “The law calls for the city and the county to author a single document for development within the ETJ. However, at the end of the day that force developers to follow the county’s code, the city’s code or a new third document,” Isbell said. “Our standards are pretty close to the city, there’s just some division in the subdivision regulations and some issues that we vary on when it comes to street standards.”
 The discussions are expected to continue at next week’s commissioners court meeting.
 In other action, commissioners gave approval to Walker County District Attorney Will Durham to renew a victim assistance coordinator position — pending grant approval from Governor Greg Abbott’s office.

Robin Morgan, who is one of three Ph.D. students working at the Bread Lab, based in Burlington, Washington, explained growers benefit from the variety's robust, permanent root system. The highly developed and interconnected roots aid in water infiltration into the soil and prevent erosion. The roots also help wheat plants better scavenge for nutrients, and they support interactions with beneficial soil microorganisms.
 Salish Blue stems range from 4 to 6 feet tall, thereby returning biomass to the soil. Raising the crop would also allow growers to dispense with years of tillage, which disturbs soil and depletes vital organic matter. The Bread Lab has been involved in breeding perennial wheat for the past 20 years and has several hundred perennial varieties in the pipeline to follow Salish Blue.
 "I heard of perennial wheat two or three years ago. I was really impressed by the direction, which I thought was very new and very different from anything before from a breeding perspective," said Morgan, who is originally from Italy and worked for an Iowa nonprofit called Seed Savers Exchange before joining the Bread Lab staff. "What I really appreciated ... is that it's about developing some tools to overcome the negatives of the annual cropping system."
 Morgan emphasized that perennial wheat won't be a "silver bullet," replacing annual wheat. Rather, he said it will be another tool to fill a niche for farmers seeking to reduce tillage, replenish organic matter and rebuild their soils.
 "It's probably not ideal to plant thousands of acres of one perennial genotype. It's more about offering opportunities to further diversify crop rotations," Morgan said.
 Morgan said Salish Blue, which has end-use qualities similar to soft white wheat, has been raised in trials on the Olympic Penninsula and in Central Montana. It yields about 70 percent of a typical annual variety and is still about two years away from being released, Morgan said.
 Morgan said some malting companies like the flavor profile of Salish Blue and are interested in using it as an adjunct ingredient for beer production.
 The Bread Lab's perennial wheat breeding program entails making crosses of wild intermediate wheat grasses with annual wheat varieties, which serve as the female parents. The wild grasses have tiny seeds, so increasing the kernel size is a point of emphasis in breeding perennial wheat, Morgan explained.
 "What we are breeding for is increasing yield, disease resistance and end-use traits so perennial wheat can become an economically viable crop for farmers," Morgan said. "What we are doing as breeders is developing a large-seeded, high-yielding perennial that will eventually yield like a regular (wheat) crop."
 The Land Institute, a nonprofit based in Salina, Kansas, devoted to developing cropping systems that mimic natural systems, has collaborated with WSU, Oklahoma State University and Michigan State University on furthering perennial wheat.
 The Land Institute estimates most perennial wheat lines yield between half and 70 percent of conventional annual varieties, and some of the perennial wheat plants have lived for more than six years in Kansas. The Land Institute has a domesticated perennial wheat hybrid called Kernza, which has roots that grow to 10 feet deep and support chest-high plants. The seeds, however, area about a fifth the size of conventional kernels.
 According to the Land Institute, perennial crops stand to help mitigate for climate change while ensuring food and water security over the long term.
 The Land Institute emphasizes that soil disturbance from annual cropping systems "has caused significant amounts of soil carbon loss — which ends up in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide — soil erosion, nutrient leakage and changes in soil organisms."

Sofia, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 27th Jan, 2020 ) :A Ukrainian man wanted for his alleged complicity in a deadly acid attack in Ukraine has been arrested in Bulgaria, prosecutors said Monday, with the victim reportedly an anti-corruption activist.
 The fugitive, named only as Oleksii L., was detained in the Black Sea city of Burgas last Friday and placed in custody until a court rules on his extradition to Ukraine, prosecutors said in a statement.
 The man is sought for "intended grievous bodily injury, which was premeditated and perpetrated by a group of people and caused the death of the victim," it added.
 Bulgaria's Chief Prosecutor spokeswoman Siyka Mileva explained that the crime in question was "an acid attack" in late July 2018 on a female victim, who died from her injuries in hospital a few months later.
 Mileva declined to name the victim, but Bulgarian media reported that the suspect was wanted for the attack on prominent Ukrainian anti-corruption activist Katerina Gandzyuk.

To be sure, 2019 was far from perfect. Antonio Brown, a handful of overmatched officials and even a cameo appearance by Colin Kaepernick kept a spotlight on the warts this behemoth of a league will always carry. And certainly the Super Bowl will offer an opportunity to discuss Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill’s history with domestic violence and the NFL’s response to it.
 But for the better part of the season, the stickiest topics have included the quarterback-slash-pitchman, Baker Mayfield, and his overrated Cleveland Browns, the underachieving Cowboys, and the possible end of the Patriots’ dynasty, to say nothing of a legion of rising young stars who were scattered throughout the league. It is led by Patrick Mahomes, the 24-year-old quarterback who brought the Chiefs to the Super Bowl to face the 49ers, the team trying to complete the NFL’s version of a fairy tale by going from 4-12 to hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in the span of a year.
 America's ever-expanding gambling landscape, the continued strength of fantasy football, the league's steady growth in Britain and other countries, along with a fair share of good games placed in the correct time slots and made available on a growing number of platforms also played roles in keeping eyeballs focused on the games.
 It all helps explain the league’s back-to-back 5% TV ratings increases — two straight years with an uptick after a two-year stretch (2016-17) during which the NFL’s status as the king of American sports took a hit, due in part to President Donald Trump’s withering criticism and, more broadly, to the league’s problematic handling of a myriad of problems that came fast and furious. The league accounted for 47 of the 50 most-watched shows on TV last year.
 "The NFL is in a better space leading up to the ... Super Bowl, than they have been in a few years," says Bettina Cornwell, the academic director at University of Oregon's Warsaw Sports Marketing Center. "Less limelight can be a good thing."
 While staying out of the constant crisis-management loop, the league took advantage of trends that have been evolving for a decade or more.
 The NFL's embrace of fantasy football at the beginning of the 2000s — replete with in-stadium Wifi advances, stat-heavy tickers and updates that permeate the telecasts and both league and team endorsements with fantasy websites — set a template that, in turn, positioned the league to take advantage of the more recent expansion of legalized gambling.

New designs that meet sustainability aspect, notably recycling of the packaging material, are also gathering traction in the bag-in-box packaging market. The shift from glass to this type of packaging for alcoholic beverages is a favorable trend, albeit still to gain widespread popularity. Moreover, many companies are shunning the use of conventional plastics in their packaging, which is a favorable trend. Furthermore, beverages companies are increasingly drawn to bag-in-box packaging as the packing enables them to differentiate their products from their competitors.

The government on Monday announced sale of 100 per cent stake in debt-laden Air India as it issued the preliminary bid document for the strategic disinvestment with the deadline for submitting expression of interest set as March 17.
 Air India would also sell 100 per cent stake in low-cost airline Air India Express and 50 per cent shareholding in joint venture AISATS, as per bid document issued on Monday.
 Management control of the airline would also be transferred to the successful bidder.
 This is the second time in less than two years that the government has come out with proposal for selling stake in Air India, which has been in the red for long.
 The government has set March 17 as the deadline for submitting the expression of interest (EoI).
 AISATS is an equal joint venture between Air India and Singapore Airlines. It offers ground handling services.
 Air India also has interests in Air India Engineering Services, Air India Air Transport Services, Airline Allied Services and Hotel Corporation of India.
 These entities are in the process of being transferred to a separate company - Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL) - and would not be a part of the proposed transaction, the document said.
 According to the document, debt of Rs 233 billion (£2.5 billion) would remain with Air India and Air India Express at the time of closing of the disinvestment.
 The remaining debt would be allocated to AIAHL.
 EY is the transaction adviser for Air India disinvestment process.
 In 2018, the government proposed to offload 76 per cent equity share capital of the national carrier as well as transfer the management control to private players. However, there were no bidders.

Over 3,000 employees in Greece were also affected, losing seasonal jobs a month early, the minister said.
 "Given the issues that arose during the year, it's obvious that we are relieved" by the 2019 results, he said, adding that negotiations with airlines and other operators had "effectively covered all 1.6 million airline seats" lost.
 Theocharis acknowledges "strain in the infrastructure" of some successful island destinations, but insists Greece is "nowhere near the kind of (congestion) issues other destinations are currently facing." For top island destinations such as Santorini, he says officials are "working to establish a berth allocation system that is more granular ... a cap per hour ... to create incentives or disincentives to spread out (cruise ship) flows," he says.
 Theocharis and other ministers travel to Paris on Tuesday alongside Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis for a business forum designed to attract investment to Greece.
 The minister notes that for many investors, a key signal will be a long- awaited breakthrough in the redevelopment of the former Athens airport of Hellinikon into a massive park.
 The eight-billion-euro project involving residences, hotels, shopping centres and cultural venues, has been delayed for years, but the government is hopeful construction will begin this year.
 "Some investors want to play it safer. For those, a big proportion of the investing community, they need to see it happening before they take the risk," the minister said.
 "When we see the first bulldozers (at Hellinikon), it will be a significant milestone (showing) that we're open for business."

The Raptors could choose to keep Gasol and/or Ibaka, but either or both could walk without returning any assets as soon as this July. Further, the team is unlikely to break the bank for either considering they’ll have to make a generous offer to retain soon-to-be free agent guard Fred VanVleet – who is having a breakout season, averaging 18.7 points and 6.7 assists per game while shooting 38.8% on a career-high 6.9 three-point attempts per game. VanVleet is only 25 years old and fits alongside Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby and the team’s young role players like Norman Powell far better than Ibaka or Gasol.

His tweets about pneumonia inspired his followers to share their own battle stories, one man tweeting that “pneumonia ain’t no joke. I had it for over a month in 2017. Got to a point where I was sure it was gonna kill me and I had to come to terms with my own mortality.”
 But after Aschoff died on Christmas Eve, his fiancee, Katy Berteau, tweeted that a rare immune system condition, called HLH, caused his death.
 She revealed that doctors found Stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in his lungs after he died.
 They were planning to get married in April.
 “Both pneumonia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma can trigger HLH in the body and that is seemingly what happened with Edward,” she wrote on social media. “All of this combined is what led to his very rapid decline those last few days, and ultimately his passing. …
 “I also wanted to provide this update because he would have wanted everyone to know that something way bigger than pneumonia took him down.”
 Anyone can get pneumonia. Half of all adults with a healthy immune system who are hospitalized for severe pneumonia in the United States are between the ages of 18 and 57, the Thoracic Society says.
 “While young healthy adults have less risk of pneumonia than the age extremes, it is always a threat,” the society says.
 But, “it is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems,” says the Mayo Cilnic.
 People who have asthma like Allen are at risk, along with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, heart failure and other health issues that compromise their immune system. Other at-risk groups include transplant patients and cancer patients who have had chemotherapy, Adiga said.
 And if you smoke, pneumonia’s got your number, too. “People who smoke are at much higher risk for having pneumonia than non-smokers,” said Adiga.
 DON’T IGNORE THE CHEST PAINS
 People might not know they have pneumonia because the symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic, mimic symptoms of the flu or a cold, “but they last longer.” Even health professionals themselves have been known to miss the signs in their own bodies.
 Symptoms include chest pain when you breathe, a cough that hacks up phlegm, a fever and shortness of breath.
 “You can have fever with a lot of different things. You can have a cough with a lot of different things,” Adiga said. “But can you differentiate? Many times patients can’t make the differentiation between ‘do I have pneumonia, do I have just a cold, the flu?
 “But the thing you want to watch out for is being short of breath. ‘Am I getting short of breath not doing anything?’ Then they need to have it checked out.”
 Chest pains are another telltale sign.
 Unlike body aches associated with the flu, pneumonia can reveal itself in pain when you take a deep breath, Adiga said.
 If you feel that pain “in one area of your chest … that is not a guarantee that you have pneumonia but it needs to be checked out.”
 ‘PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE’
 Even though he was taking a Zithromax Z-Pak antibiotic, Allen had been coughing up rust-colored phlegm and feeling tightness in his chest.
 But then, at his Kansas City, Kansas, home one night after work he had an asthma attack in the bathtub “that was so bad I almost couldn’t get out. … I was so nervous especially with how fast and bad it got.”
 He managed to stumble into his roommate’s room and tell him something was wrong. He went to his bedroom and used his nebulizer breathing treatment. He’s had asthma since fourth grade.
 When he still couldn’t catch his breath, they headed for Saint Luke’s where, Allen said, he was treated with steroids and placed on another machine to help him breathe. A chest X-ray found two spots on his right lung.
 “Even if you’re not at risk (for pneumonia) it’s something I think people should be aware of,” he said.
 THERE’S A VACCINE FOR THAT
 Just because you have a cough doesn’t mean you have pneumonia. The only way to diagnose it “is with a good exam … and of course getting a chest X-ray. That’s pretty much the gold standard,” said Adiga. “You need an X-ray to be able to tell whether you have pneumonia or not.”
 It’s rare that pneumonia gets better without treatment, he said. “Typically (people) will get sicker and sicker and seek help. A lot of those can be treated outpatient. Doctors do send people home from their offices with antibiotics for pneumonia if they are otherwise not too ill and they are reliable in taking medications.”
 Preventing pneumonia involves common-sense hygiene habits, and vaccines.

Hi, Simon. We're continuing to see an acceleration in Telcos starting to move to virtualization. We saw a couple of large deals again in that space this quarter with large service providers and this is driven by essentially readiness for 5G and also the desire for service providers to be able to move faster when they need to make changes to their infrastructure and overall be able to reduce their costs. What we're seeing for now is service providers kind of keeping their more hardware based infrastructure in place and starting kind of Greenfield software implementations for virtualization. Over the long time, I think these will converge, but for now those we see in the service providers that we work with, we see these as two separate environments for the time being. Overall the trend is accelerating.

 The AECJ said this was insufficient and that Amazon should be aiming for a 2030 target.
 "This is not the time for silencing voices. We need policies that welcome more open discourse, more problem-solving, and more urgent and concerted action about climate change and its causes," said Mark Hiew, a senior marketing manager at Amazon.
 Responding to the letter, an Amazon spokesperson defended its policy on public statements about the company.
 "While all employees are welcome to engage constructively with any of the many teams inside Amazon that work on sustainability and other topics, we do enforce our external communications policy and will not allow employees to publicly disparage or misrepresent the company or the hard work of their colleagues who are developing solutions to these hard problems," the company said.

A Kansas House committee for the second consecutive year voted to remove from state law the spousal exemption to the crime of sexual battery.


  The measure surfaced during the 2019 legislative session, but it was never considered by the full House. The House Judiciary Committee unanimously voted Monday to once again seek traction for the reform in the current 2020 session.


  "Kansas has long since recognized that rape within the confines of marriage is a crime and it is past time to establish the same for sexual battery," said Mary Stafford, a licensed social worker who testified on behalf of the change. "Permitting the statute to remain as currently written sends a message to perpetrators that they can sexually violate their spouses and will not be held accountable."


  The spousal exemption was rooted in 17th century common law establishing unconditional sexual consent as a feature of marital contracts.


  Victoria Pickering, director of advocacy for the Metropolitan Organization to County Sexual Assault in Wyandotte and Johnson counties, said removal of the exemption would be practical and symbolic.


  It sends a message to the public that violence is no less harmful when it occurs at the hands of someone the victim trusts, she said.


  No one testified in opposition to House Bill 2467 and the House Judiciary Committee passed it without debate.


  During the 2019 legislative session, House Republicans shared concern said elimination of the exemption would cloud understanding of consent in the context of marriage. Rep. Emil Berquist, R-Park City, said a year ago changing the law could enable a spouse who regretted experimenting with "sadomasochistic acts" to accuse a husband or wife of a misdemeanor crime.


  Rep. Kellie Warren, a Leawood Republican, said a year ago the bill would leave someone open to criminal prosecution because he or she was in the mood for sex while the spouse wasn't on the same page.


  The offense of sexual battery is defined as unwanted contact with an intimate body part for sexual arousal, gratification or abuse.


  In 2018, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation reported 24,066 incidents of domestic violence across the state. The National Institute of Justice produced a study suggesting a mere one-fourth of domestic violence incidents were reported to police. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence estimated 40% of women were sexually assaulted by intimate partners during their relationship.


  "The current law is especially harmful to individuals who are sexually battered as part of an abusive marriage," said Michelle McCormick, program director for the YWCA Center for Safety and Empowerment in Topeka. "It seems unconscionable to me that we would allow a law to stand that allows unwanted sexually violent touch within marriages."
