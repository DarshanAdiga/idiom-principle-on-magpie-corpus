Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner are unquestionably hailed as the power couple of Hollywood.  
 The couple may be happily married currently but their love story too had its fair share of drama and hurdles. Unearthed reports coming to surface have revealed how the _Game of Thrones_ star and the former Disney actor had nearly called off their wedding as they broke up only a day before they tied the knot.
 According to _The Sunday Times_ , Turner disclosed how both of them were getting nervous about the idea of getting married a day before their Las Vegas wedding, resulting in them parting ways briefly.
 “It was the worst day of our lives. For a second, we both had cold feet. Then, 24 hours later, we were both like, ‘never mind,'” said Turner.
 “I was going through this phase of being very mentally unwell. He was like, ‘I can’t be with you until you love yourself, I can’t see you love me more than you love yourself.’ That was something, him doing that. I think he kind of saved my life, in a way,” she recalled.
 The two got hitched the next day in what fans assumed was an impromptu wedding at Las Vegas. However, that too was planned ahead of time, as revealed by Jonas during an interview with _BAZAAR.com_.
 The two had their eyes set on a wedding venue in France which is why they needed to have a legal marriage in the US beforehand: “We had to do a legal marriage before we did a real big one. It was either the courthouse, or our version, and I preferred our version… Friends, Elvis, and Ring Pops.”
 Since their marriage last year, the two are now parents to their daughter, Willa, who was born in July 2020.

NAYANA WILLIAMS - BUILDING SUCCESS FROM SCRATCH  


--DocBreak--
Before the novel coronavirus pandemic took hold in Northeast Tennessee, Chandra Campbell would head straight to her parents’ house after work to pick up her daughter.


  Now the intensive care nurse, who treats COVID-19 patients at Johnson City Medical Center, has a new routine


  After her 13-hour shift ends, Campbell showers on site before going home and showering a second time. After the second shower, she heads to her parents’ house and picks up her daughter from the porch or driveway — not stepping foot into their house.


  “I’m just afraid of the risk, working on the COVID unit,” Campbell said. “You think about your shoes, your clothing, your car, the mask — everything crosses your mind, and you just want to be as safe as possible.”


  Fearful of the potential risk to both herself and others, Campbell also stopped going to church.


  Fortunately for her, Campbell said the chaplain support at the hospital has been “great,” and said chaplains have prayed over them and their patients and blessed their unit in the past. Recently, a chaplain sat in the corner and softly played a guitar. Campbell said it was “just something soothing.”


  “We’ve had great support from the beginning and still have great support, and hopefully we’ll end up making a difference,” she said.


  Campbell, of course, isn’t the only one feeling the emotional toll from the pandemic.


  Dr. Leon Bass, a critical care physician working with COVID-19 patients at JCMC, said it’s something you can acknowledge and recognize, and said seeing patients survive and knowing you made a difference in their life does a lot to help. Bass noted one patient who was recently discharged after a lengthy hospital stay, and said “it’s worth it to know that maybe those that have potential to survive, that we’re there every day for them and can help them through this.”


  “We’re understanding that this is a necessity, in order to take care of these patients, we just have to (push forward),” Bass said. “Yes, we can acknowledge (the emotional toll), and we can recognize it — we do a lot of debriefing of each other and kind of vent to one another and share those emotions — but at the end of the day we’re doing our best to take care of the patients and that’s job number one.


  “With that as our focus,” he continued, “we come in every day and take care of it.”


  For Tracey Rhodes, an infection preventionist with Ballad, planning for a pandemic has always been part of her job — but now, it’s all-consuming.


  “Before COVID, pandemic planning was a part of my job, but just a small piece,” Rhodes said. “We never planned mentally or physically for the longevity of a pandemic because it is exhausting.


  “These folks, I don’t know how they do it day-in and day-out all day,” she said, her voice starting to crack. “It’s just trying.”


  While Bass and Campbell have enormous pressure to treat their patients and keep them alive, Rhodes faces a different kind of pressure: keeping them safe. Rhodes helped write the safety protocols for donning and doffing personal protective equipment and conducted the training, and said she’d feel personally responsible if a team member contracted the virus.


  To date, none have at Johnson City Medical Center.


  “It is a different kind of pressure, because I know Chandra has a little girl and I want to make sure Chandra is OK to go home to her daughter,” Rhodes said. “It’s a completely different type of pressure than what they feel, but I take it very seriously.”

In March, when the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee declared a state of emergency, recommended schools close statewide and issued a safer-at-home order for residents.


  To help slow the spread of the new virus and allow officials to learn more about it, the state’s thousands of school children suddenly transitioned to online learning from home, a jarring switch in the middle of the school year.


  COVID-19 is still present in our communities, but health and education officials say they now know more about the virus and its risks than they did six months ago.


  As local districts welcome students back to classrooms, Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said decisions to close districts and individual schools won’t be easy to make.


  Determining whether it’s appropriate to close schools, or in extreme cases, whole districts, is a nuanced process to determine the virus’ spread within districts and communities, she said.


  All summer, Piercey said the Health Department fielded calls from worried school administrators looking for definite answers about whether it was safe for their schools to reopen and advice on what statistic to use to know it was safe.


  “I understand the desire of school administrators, who have no health training, when they’re trying to make these difficult decisions, they want objectivity,” she said. “They want a green light or a red light. The problem is, there’s not one metric that says whether schools should be open or should not be open.”


  As local districts prepared to begin classes in August, many of them released reopening plans under advisement from local health departments determining the level of community spread using state-published EpiCurve data showing the average number of new cases of COVID-19 in each county per 100,000 population over two weeks. The calculations for it helped standardize the rate across urban and rural counties in the state.


  In mid-July, coronavirus cases spiked in Northeast Tennessee. As the districts’ first days of school approached in August, every county was in the “red zone” of significant community spread, according to the EpiCurve charts.


  But Piercey said that was an imperfect metric originally intended to safeguard residents in nursing homes particularly susceptible to the virus, not school children, who statistically are expected to suffer less harm.


  She said the state Health Department never advised districts to use only one metric to make opening decisions, but a more appropriate measure and method was needed.


  In August, while most classes in the area were taking place online, the state Health and Education departments encouraged school districts to begin holding in-person classes and released a COVID-19 response rubric to help administrators decide how to handle positive cases in schools.


  The rubric, updated again last week, uses White House Coronavirus Task Force criteria to determine levels of community spread in each county. The white, yellow and red classifications are starting points to help make response decisions, not the only determinant.


  It strongly discourages district-wide closures except under the most extreme circumstances. More frequently, it recommends closing classrooms for 24 hours for cleaning when cases of the virus are identified. It ramps up to closing hallways and buildings with multiple cases for which contacts can’t be identified. Districts are generally recommended to contact local health department officials for advice on closures and tracing.


  Instead of the single statistic of average cases over two-weeks per 100,000 population used by the EpiCurve, the White House Task Force Map uses two numbers to gauge community spread, new cases per 100,000 population in the last week and the proportion of positive tests in a week.


  If the rate of new cases per 100,000 in a county is higher than 100 and the proportion of positive tests is higher than 10% in the previous week, that county is in the red zone. If the new case rate is between 10 and 100 and test positivity is between 5% and 10%, or if one metric is and the other is at the red zone level, the county is in the yellow zone. If either metric is lower than yellow level, the county is in the white zone.


  Piercey said the White House Task Force classification isn’t perfect either — its data lags the state’s data and is pulled from different sources, making it difficult to directly compare to the state’s numbers — but it’s more comprehensive and better suited for school district use than the EpiCurves.


  As of Aug. 30, the White House Task Force report had Greene, Johnson, Sullivan and Unicoi counties in the red zone, Carter, Hawkins and Washington counties in the yellow zone and Hancock in the white zone.


  As they prepare to reopen for in-person learning in the coming weeks, several school administrators have mentioned the White House Task Force Map and the state’s management criteria.


  Still, Piercey said those designations should be paired with other factors, like an outbreak at the Sullivan County jail that was contained and had little impact on the county’s school children, for making school decisions.


  “It’s a helpful piece of data, but there’s not one sole metric to be used for these decisions,” she said. “These decisions are very nuanced and should be made locally.”

As the lazy days of summer get closer to fall, this weekend is usually one of the last for warm weather celebrations.


  But local officials also want people to be safe in whatever activity they’re doing for Labor Day.


  “We ask people to be very cautious using a grill,” Johnson City Fire Chief Jim Stables said. “People shouldn’t be grilling on their back deck in the city. Use proper materials, proper spacing from your home.”


  Stables said first responder authorities want residents to enjoy their holiday, but in a safe way.


  “We just want people to enjoy the holiday and stay safe. That’s what we’re looking for. There are no open fires in the city except for cooking food, and don’t leave it unattended.”


  Two condominiums at Woodstone on East Oakland Avenue were destroyed in July after a fire started on a back deck of one of the condos.


  “The contributing factor was found to be outside on the deck area ... the only thing out there was the grill and electrical outlets.”


  “Also stay hydrated, don’t get sunburned,” Stables said. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are common when people don’t heed warnings about how to stay cool.


  The Johnson City Police Department is partnering with the Tennessee Highway Safety Office to place additional officers on the lookout for impaired drivers.


  “The statistics prove that we have a lot of work to do to put an end to impaired driving,” Police Chief Karl Turner said.


  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), during the 2018 Labor Day Holiday Weekend there were 439 traffic crash deaths of which 43% involved drivers who had been drinking. During Labor Day weekend in 2018 JCPD arrested three suspected impaired drivers and investigated two alcohol-related vehicle crashes.


  “Buzzed driving is drunk driving. Working together, we can reduce crashes, injuries, and deaths on Johnson City roadways,” Turner said. “JCPD and THSO want to remind all drivers that impaired-driving is not only illegal, it is a matter of life and death. If you choose to celebrate the Labor Day holiday the decision to not drink and drive should never be a tough one.


  Turner suggested designating a sober driver or planning for a ride service to get home safely and to not let friends drive home drunk.


  Residents may report impaired drivers by calling 911.


  The consequences of a single DUI conviction for a first-time offender in the state of Tennessee may include costly fines, court costs, legal fees, jail time, mandatory drug and alcohol treatment, and/or the installation of an ignition interlock device in their vehicle.


  The THSO provides grant funding to support Johnson City Police Department's increased enforcement efforts during the "Booze It and Lose It" campaign. For more information about the THSO, please visit www.tntrafficsafety.org.


  Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency officers will also be out on the water, looking for dangerous boating behavior, like boating under the influence and other reckless operation.


  In a press release Wednesday, the agency emphasized the use of life jackets while boating in a safe and responsible manner.


  The TWRA has seen a large increase in paddle craft activity throughout the state.


  “Paddleboards, canoes, and kayaks are recreational vessels and shouldn’t be treated as toys,” said Cpt. Matt Majors, TWRA Boating Investigator. “Boaters should have the proper life jackets and wear them. It is important to stay away from swollen creeks and rivers as the waters can be hazardous to novice boaters.”


  To date in 2020 on Tennessee waters, there have been 22 boating-related fatalities, an increase of 16 from the same time last year. There have been 49 incidents resulting in 65 people injured and 70 property damage incidents.

Of course, coordinating this tapestry of lies is president Edgar Lungu, the main beneficiary of the lies. Most people do not know Edgar Lungu, those who support and who oppose him, both sides do not know him. Edgar is a complicated figure. Remember, starting from his party, his ascendancy to lead the party was controversial. There were two conventions his came after the first convention which he just ignored and organised his. Following that he ordered some judges to affirm his leadership and the rest is history. In 2016 when Hichilema dared complain against the election in which he was controversially declared loser, Edgar simply banned the Constitutional Court from hearing Hichilema’s complaints. With this history in mind, it is quite clear most of those who jumped the bandwagon and made remarks finding Hichilema guilty as charged by Edith Nawakwi did so as Edgar’s surrogates, a suggestion Hichilema made.

Calanog and Cartagena are lucky. They were able to get four hours of shore leave, including a trip to Walmart to pick up snacks, video games and essential items.


  It's a welcome change, Cartagena said. "Sometimes you need to refresh, have a conversation with some other people."


  When they're not on the chemical tanker, they stop by Mariners' House, a kind of clubhouse in Montreal's port for seafarers, which is run by chaplains and financed by the port and by the shipping companies.


  Normally in August, the place would be filled with staff from cruise ships and from commercial vessels who come to shoot pool, buy supplies and souvenirs, or sit and chat with the chaplains of the Ministry to Seafarers, a religious organization linked to the Christian Reformed Church. On this day, however, Calanog and his two friends are the only ones there.


  David Rozeboom, a chaplain with the Ministry for 13 years, estimates less than half of the ships that dock in Montreal are allowing their crews to come ashore.


  Lately, much of his job has consisted of running errands such as buying socks and toothpaste, and wiring money home for those who aren't allowed to, or are too fearful of COVID-19 to get off the ship.


  Rozeboom doesn't share a religion with most of the seafarers he meets, most of whom come from India, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe. Especially now, he says, the majority are more interested in discussing local news than spiritual matters.


  But he says he's happy to help how he can, whether it's sending a wire transfer or climbing aboard a ship to have a friendly chat with a group of Indian seafarers in the mess hall.


  "They're an unseen group of essential workers inaccessible to a large part of the population, and it just happens we were serving them before, and now we have a different way of serving them," Rozeboom said.


  Lahay says the crew-change situation has only worsened in recent months, despite efforts from countries such as Canada.


  He had praise for Transport Canada, which he said has allowed shore leave, has worked on a welfare committee for seafarers, and is collaborating with different partners to help accelerate visa processing and facilitate crew switches.


  But despite rising international awareness, Lahay said he believes there could be 400,000 seafarers working beyond contract at the moment, compared to 200,000 in July.


  While there are no easy answers to getting them home, Lahay says countries, including Canada, need to be more strict in enforcing rules governing the treatment of seafarers and to crack down on the many companies flouting them.


  "We have to draw a line in the sand, because nothing's going to change until we do," he said.


  This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 6, 2020.

In the UK, the latest estimate for the R number, the number of people each coronavirus case infects, has risen to between 0.9 and 1.1, up slightly from 0.8 to 1.0 the previous week. However, due to a time lag in the data used to model the R number, this is more representative of the situation two to three weeks ago. Estimates for the infection growth rates range between -3 and 1 per cent. This suggests infections in the UK are levelling off on average, in a continuation of the trend observed over the last few weeks. This is consistent with the latest results from the random swab testing survey by the Office for National Statistics, which suggests about 24,600 people in England – 1 in 2200 – had the virus in the week ending 13 August, compared to 28,300 people – 1 in 1900 – in the week ending 9 August

  That night, when Uptown businesses were burned and looted, DeBerge’s was burglarized, too. The front and back doors were smashed, and a small fire was set inside.


  “Luckily, a good Samaritan took our burning scarf rack outside and stomped out the fire,” Kim DeBerge said. The cash registers — without much cash inside — were opened, and looters grabbed various items before running outside. Besides the broken glass, there are scorch marks on the store’s wooden floor but no other damage. (The DeBerges viewed the looting on surveillance video from the Racine Kenosha Community Action Agency next door to their business.)

MONTREAL - Resig Calanog's walk around Montreal's port is only the second time in nine months he's been on solid ground.


  Even for a career ship worker, it's a lot of time at sea. As for when he'll be able to walk in his homeland in the Philippines and see his three children, that remains uncertain.


  "Soon, I hope," he said.


  Calanog, 36, is one of hundreds of thousands of ship workers around the world who have been thrown in limbo by the COVID-19 pandemic. They've been confined to their vessels and can't spend leisure time ashore while international travel restrictions have made it complicated and difficult for shipping companies to replace crews.


  Peter Lahay, the Canadian co-ordinator for the International Transport Workers' Federation, estimates some 400,000 seafarers around the world are currently past the end of their contracts because they have no way to get home.


  Many countries that supply large numbers of seafarers, such as India, have grounded commercial flights and imposed travel restrictions, forcing shipping companies to charter planes or send their employees on a costly and circuitous journey through several countries.


  Lahay says seafarers are used to working contracts of up to 11 months — the maximum allowed under international maritime conventions. But he estimates between 40 and 50 per cent of them have been away from home longer than that.


  "When you start pushing it up to 16 or 17 months with no end in sight, for many of them, it's an enormous struggle for them emotionally," he said in a phone interview. "We're getting lots of emails saying they're breaking down and their fatigue levels are so high it's affecting their job performance."


  Calanog is hopeful he'll be replaced at the next stop in Rotterdam, but it's not a sure thing.


  "If they change me, success!" he said.


  While he's eager to see his family in the Philippines, he's grateful to be working at a time when many people at home are unemployed due to COVID-19. And once he returns home, he says he'll worry about getting stuck there and missing out on another contract.


  His fellow shipmate, Ian Cartagena, says the company that owns the chemical tanker on which they've been working has been urging them to be patient. Cartagena says he believes the company is doing the best it can to get them home.


  "I understand it's hard," he said.


  Lahay says some companies are trying to "move heaven and earth" to get their seafarers home. Others, he said, have been unwilling to assume the expense and the logistical headache, knowing that seafarers, who work on contract, are reluctant to complain for fear of losing future work.


  "These seafarers are lawfully entitled to go home, but they're afraid to ask to go home because they believe, with good reason, that they could be blacklisted from the industry," Lahay said.


  The problem is compounded by the fact many sailors haven't stepped off their ships for months and have been denied shore leave by their host countries, or, more often, by their employers, who fear they'll bring the virus aboard.

Wrote Schmitter: “It is a rare thing when the President and all 50 governors agree on something, but they agree on this, and they all disagree with you.”
 Walz and Gazelka met the day after the Schmitter letter and told the press after the meeting they re-established their respectful working relationship and are looking for common ground.
 We hope that vow is sincere.
 Another special session is expected to take place Friday and Gazelka says he favors the $1 billion plus bonding bill that was nearly passed in July. In fact, it was only the minority in the House GOP caucus that said they would not agree to it unless Walz give up his emergency powers.
 Gazelka recently said the House was moving more favorably on that issue. These pages had earlier put 90 percent of the blame for the bonding bill’s failure on the House GOP minority.
 It’s not unreasonable for the Walz administration to consider criteria for ending the state of emergency. To some extent, Walz’s “dial” system for safety measures versus outbreak numbers addresses that directly.
 It’s also very reasonable to approve a bonding bill that was 95 percent to the finish line in July.
 Both Walz and Gazelka have said they’re committed to finding common ground. To do so, they should put Minnesotans first before their political interests.

Seven months ago, John Morrissey found himself working for the city of Kenosha as part-time director for its newly created inspections department.


  Morrissey, 57, had come out of a three-year retirement following 28 years in law enforcement, the last nine of those as chief of police. Last month, the City Council approved his appointment to lead, not just one department, but all the departments housed at City Hall. He officially took over as city administrator on June 22, replacing Randy Hernandez, who left to join his son in a new business venture after just a year in the position.


  “With Randy’s unexpected announcement, the mayor had come down and asked if I would be interested,” said Morrissey, who has immersed himself in the day-to- day functions of the city,” he said. “As I explained to the mayor for this position, as long as he and the council feel that I can add value, that my services are what they’re looking for, I’d be happy to serve. The only other condition would be my health, which is fine currently.”


  Morrissey said he believes he can work at least another 10 years.


  “I’m in the position that I feel and they feel I could add value to this position, it’s something I certainly feel and can handle and look forward to doing again back in city government. It is a whole different thing when you’re looking at 19 departments versus one,” Morrissey said.


  “It’s a whole different outlook. … Now you’re looking at everything.”


  His main duty as city administrator, he said, is to help free up time for Mayor John Antaramian to promote the city for development.


  “One of the reasons the mayor asked me, he wants to get away from the daily operations of the city,” Morrissey said. “ He wants to go back to the planning and the projects and working specifically the downtown project and the Chrysler plan and as, you know, we get further west to the interstate (the former Dairyland property). That’s what he wants to start focusing on.


  “He can talk to the people for the grants that we need, dealing with different corporations on the Chrysler site and the innovation center he wants to do there. There’s a lot of work that goes into that,” he said.


  First orders of business


  Morrissey said among the first orders of business is hiring a director of development following longtime director Jeff LaBahn’s retirement July 1. A nationwide search is currently under way, he said. In the interim, deputy director Rich Schroeder is filling in.


  “It’s one of the highest priorities here we need to make sure (is hired) because there’s so much going on with development here in the city,” Morrissey said. “You can start at the lakefront and go west to the interstate and there’s something being planned, developed — whether they’re brand new like the Chrysler site or downtown, or Kwik Trip building a new building at 80th and 39th. So that position is integral. That, to me, is extremely important.”


  City Clerk Debbie Salas has also retired, he said, with deputy clerk Karen Argust filling in. A replacement is also being sought.


  He said he is anticipating at least one or two more retirements before the end of the year, but they have yet to file the paperwork.


  “That’s just the department head level,” he said.


  Morrissey said the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the need for cohesiveness among department leadership and throughout the city’s work culture.


  On July 7, staff who normally work in the city’s Municipal Building and had been working at home due to the pandemic, were brought back full time in house. Morrissey said that he had planned for a “soft” re-opening the early part of July, with staff in attendance at city committee meetings, and a full opening including the public July 20; however, that has now been delayed to July 27.


  Mayor John Antaramian, who has been in close communication with the county’s division of health, has reported an upturn in the number of COVID-19 cases, Morrissey said. In fact, four employees have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, including two in the same department. The family of an employee who has been hospitalized was quarantined because members have been infected, as well. The employee did not contract the coronavirus while on the job.


  “We just decided we’ve just got to be safe,” he said. “Four employees out of the 700 may not seem like a lot, but it’s much bigger than just four employees.


  “We just have to really pay attention to where these numbers are going. I don’t think that putting off committee meetings and council meetings for another couple weeks, a month, whatever it takes … we just need to make sure the employees’ safety and then the general public coming into this building is taken care of,” he said.


  Employees at City Hall, for example, are now required to wear masks in common areas and in-person meetings. City crews have been installing Plexiglas partitions at the entry areas of offices.


  “The majority of us have some kind of barrier. The Council Chambers is being re-fitted so that each (council member), I’ll call it a cubicle, so that each councilperson will have an individual cubicle,” he said.


  In-person council meetings, which were originally scheduled to restart July 20 have been “put off until further notice,” Morrissey said. The council, its committees and commissions, along with other panels that advise them continue to meet via Zoom for phone-in teleconferences.


  Changes when the public returns


  When the public returns, they’ll see markings on the floor, at least six feet apart, to maintain physical/social distancing.


  “As you probably know, there are two spectrums — from way right to way left. I’m not playing any politics. I couldn’t care less. We’re looking at it as a safety issue,” he said. “That stuff is just out. Our decisions are made strictly on what we can get through the best information to keep our employees safe. But along with that, we need to keep the public safe.”


  Throughout the building will be signs that indicate employees’ requirement to wear masks, and the public to “please wear a mask to protect our employees,” he said.


  “We can’t require it (with the public). We are going to very strongly request that they do,” he said.


  Before the Municipal Building re-opened for staff, the city required testing for all its employees regardless of whether they work in the building or in the field, Morrissey said. City employees received testing through National Guard units that were performed June 23-24, if they had not already sought testing previously. Police and fire personnel were excluded because they had already followed and were tested with specific protocols in place as first responders


  Morrissey said he’s been tested twice, with negative results both times. Other employees have been tested as many as three to four times.


  “Bringing employees back, getting back to some sense of normalcy, right now, is what we need,” he said.


  Working among colleagues again, he said, makes it easier for him to follow up with department heads.


  “I think it’s much easier, but daily, I’m talking with (human resources), the health department to make sure we are doing what we can,” he said. “If we saw a huge spike (in cases) in this building, I wouldn’t hesitate to close it back down. I know that some citizens don’t like that. I personally have not had a lot of calls saying, `You need to open this building.’”


  Other areas of focus


  Morrissey’s brief tenure as administrator isn’t just focused on the pandemic.


  He’s coordinating with the city’s waste management department to insure that the new automated system for recycling and trash pickup goes smoothly as most residents receive their bins next month. Inspections, the department he previously headed, has fielded more complaints for unkempt properties than a year ago even as residents have remained at home during the pandemic.


  He said that department has responded to more than 400 complaints in the first 6 months about uncut lawns — the office typically averages about 500 calls in a year. Recently, the council approved a noxious weed ordinance lowering the grass and weed height to 8 inches. Previously, growth was restricted to a foot for weeds.


  If there were no pandemic, he said, inspections would be fast-tracking an initiative to crack down on nuisance houses.


  Morrissey said his management style is one of professionalism and relying on the city’s department heads for their expertise, a protocol he followed when he was police chief.


  “I’m hoping to work with the council to get them the information that they need. I hate hearing, `We didn’t get this information until the last minute,’ or, ‘It would’ve been nice to know this,’” he said. “It’s certainly interesting times.”

In May, neighbouring Australia reported lower flu rates than usual, which was also attributed to coronavirus lockdown measures. New Zealand has recorded only 22 covid-19 related deaths.

Since I am not convinced that there is a widely accepted modern reconciliation of faith and science, the question about Abu Nasr al-Farabi’s role as a precursor of modernity is difficult to answer. I suppose we could say that Abu Nasr al-Farabi’s attempt to prove the existence of one first principle of all being (the God of monotheistic religions), and to trace other religious doctrines back to this principle without relying on the authority of revealed text, could still provide a paradigm for contemporary attempts at reconciliation between science and religion. When it comes to early modern European ways of thinking about the two, it seems to me that at least some prominent thinkers, such as the German scientist Leibniz, were building on a foundation partly laid by Abu Nasr al-Farabi and Avicenna. However, I hesitate to make a straightforward connection between the two epochs, simply because there was a variety of philosophical theories in the early modern period, and because we also have to bear in mind the influence of the intervening medieval Latin discussions.

 # Mixed reviews for COVID bills
 Bucks County Courier Times
 Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, R1, deserves credit for drafting a set of bills designed to review our nation's response to the coronavirus in great detail and make a series of strategic recommendations going forward.
 The Bucks County Republican also gets a tip of the cap for reaching across the aisle to bring Democratic representatives on board as co-sponsors.
 At a time in which rampant partisanship seems be the order of the day, we appreciate the work of the Problem Solvers Caucus, which inspired the bills, to look for commonsense solutions that people can agree on.
 Fitzpatrick's bills are the Made in America Emergency Preparedness Act (HR 6431), the Never Again Small Business Protection Act (HR 6497) and the Never Again International Outbreak Prevention Act (HR 7132).
 The bills have a nice ring to them and they're no-doubt well intentioned but all three are sitting idle in House committees. It seems increasingly likely that they'll die there. Members of our board, while praising Fitzpatrick's efforts and ambition, nonetheless voiced concerns about each bill.
 The Made in America Preparedness Act would authorize creation of a National Commission on the United States' Preparedness for National Emergency. Modeled after the 9-11 Commission, it would be tasked with figuring out how to bring the medical supply chains we rely on back to the United States. It'd also head up the effort to fairly study the United States' response to the coronavirus with an eye toward improving it.
 We believe there's no shortage of decisions to study and our board members understand the value of doing so. We also wholeheartedly support actions that'd lessen our troubling reliance on China for medicines and medical equipment.
 And yet, the creation of another layer of bureaucracy in the form of a commission concerns us. We hope that medical professionals would be well represented, particularly if, as the bill's summary suggests, "the commission shall report to the President and Congress regarding...which medical, pharmaceutical and emergency preparedness products are determined to be essential..." and that "states that fail to implement the findings of the commission's report by Jan. 1, 2025...will lose access to all federal funds for emergency preparedness..." unless they receive a special exemption.
 It's worth pointing out that Free2Care, a coalition of physician and patient organizations, whose member groups total over 3 million people nationally, including 70,000 practicing physicians, is lobbying against HR 6431.
 Another option for reducing our dependence on China is a Republican-led "Made in America Act" that incentivizes domestic drug manufacturing with a new tax credit.
 The Never Again Small Business Protection Act would provide small businesses and nonprofits with access to business interruption insurance that can be tapped during national emergencies if the losses stem from a government- ordered shutdown. Businesses that lay off employees or that dump health insurance coverage would be ineligible. A faction of our board is uncomfortable with the idea that taxpayer money would be used to cover a business's loss.
 The Never Again International Outbreak Prevention Act would require international reporting and monitoring of outbreaks and sanctions against what Fitzpatrick recently called "bad actors" and allow for the stripping of sovereign immunity of countries that have intentionally misled the international community regarding a pandemic's outbreak. It also calls for reviewing the actions of the World Health Organization, which President Trump has said he will pull out of by July 2021.
 We generally support this bill. We'd like it even more if it came with a pledge to stick with the WHO. But we believe one of its provisions — allowing American citizens to sue foreign nations for damages caused by a pandemic — seems like political gamesmanship.
 Bottom line: Some elements of his "Never Again" plan may require some TLC. But at least he has a plan and we think it shows his heart is in the right place.

Schools in England are due to reopen in September, but a spokesperson for the prime minister today said there are no plans to review the current guidance in England for the wearing of face coverings in schools.

Defence Minister Davis Chama and former Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi took turns this week lambasting opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema as a ‘criminal’ over his role in the privatisation of the public economy some thirty years ago. Could it be that it is because they are criminals themselves which is why they easily can recognise a criminal when they see one? How do we explain senior government officials so easily using the word ‘criminal’ against the grain of the law if they are not?

On a recent trip to PetSmart to get a toy, she did something so outrageous it just made me laugh.


  Before we left the house I walked her, giving her a chance to pee. She apparently didn’t have to go so we hopped in the car.


  Daisy Duke loves to ride in the car with the windows open and her ears and jowls flapping in the wind. Sometimes I take the long way so she can enjoy the ride a little more. The inside of my windshield on the passenger side is full of nose marks.


  When we got to the store, I gave her a second chance to go. Again, nothing.


  As we walked up and down the toy and bone aisles, she stopped in her tracks, more accurately MY tracks. She squatted and peed right on my foot. Keep in mind, she is completely housebroken and hasn’t had an accident in the house in two years. Yet she chose my right foot — and I was wearing mesh sneakers — to have one. Luckily — I guess you could call it luckily — she didn’t pee much and my shoe absorbed the liquid and nobody had to come clean it up.


  What did we do next?


  I sloshed up and down the toy and bone aisles some more. I knew for sure she wasn’t about to leave without a toy. She eventually stopped and picked out a stuffed badger. I knew the badger didn’t stand a chance in the mouth of such a “ferocious” hound but I bought it anyway.


  It gave her a good four days of hard playing before she finally was able to achieve her goal — ripping it open so she could spread the white stuffing all over the house. Give that girl a stuffed animal and that becomes her full-time job, and she’s getting very good at it.


  In fact, she’s getting so good at it that sometimes she doesn’t need a toy. On a recent afternoon, she was spending some time by herself on the screened- in portion of our back porch. It’s where she likes to keep a lookout for any dogs or people or leaves or wind that might come by and scare her.


  On this particular day, Daisy Duke decided the cushions on the outdoor furniture looked delicious.


  When I went out to check on her for being suspiciously quiet, I cringed. She was lying in the midst of a pile of white stuffing. It looked like a bad Christmas decoration. She chewed two cushions into oblivion.


  When I looked at her and asked her what was she doing, she looked back defiantly and gave me one long blast of what we call her “cookie horn.”


  “Bar-oooooo!”


  I think it meant “Yeah, I did it. What are you gonna do about it?”


  She has destroyed three cushions so far, yet I get the blame.


  But there is good news. New cushions have been ordered. And as delicious as they might look with all those flowers on them, Daisy Duke won’t be allowed near them unless we forget. Then all bets are off.


  Rest assured there won’t be any cushions on the chairs at the shelter on Saturday. Anyway, Daisy Duke will be too busy meeting people to destroy anything. She can’t wait to see you. Hopefully she’ll stay still long enough to snap a few pictures and make a few new friends.


  Keep your paws crossed.

The Thiruvananthapuram City police have constituted a special investigation team to probe the conspiracy behind the vandalism of Congress leader G. Leena’s house for which her son was arrested a day ago.


  Inspector General and City Police Commissioner Balram Kumar Upadhyay on Saturday entrusted the case to a team led by the Assistant Commissioner, Shanghumughom. The Poonthura police had on Friday arrested Ms. Leena’s son Likhin Krishnan, 21, for allegedly vandalising their house at Muttathara.


  The police claimed that the youth confessed to the crime apparently to frame their political opponents. Among various aspects, the police are likely to investigate any possible role that Ms. Leena could have had in the incident.


  However, Mr. Krishnan, who obtained bail in the case, claimed innocence and alleged that he was made to accept the charges after being threatened by the police.

When Stacey Cham-Klein pulled her two daughters, Olivia and Elaina, out of school a week before March break earlier this year with concerns over COVID-19, little did she know of the intense work ahead to keep the girls up to par with their education.


  With the girls enrolled in the French immersion, program, Cham-Klein faced new challenges to propel them through a French curriculum while trying to navigate through the language. Cham-Klein does not speak French.


  “I work from home and we were able to do a lot of assignments reasonably easily, but the only problem we had was when the teacher’s notes were all handed out to the parents in French,” she said. “I spent a lot of time on Google Translate figuring things out. That wasted a lot of time and was quite frustrating for my daughter, who is an ‘I’ve got to get this done’ kind of kid.”


  The family struggled to keep up with the lessons but didn’t know if something was or wasn’t covered in the classroom.


  “We got lots of math assignments and French language assignments but we didn’t get the subjects (that were already covered so I took to the school board curriculum website and asked my daughter, “did you do this with your teacher? Did you cover this? Did you look at building bridges or other experiments that they had? If there was a ‘no,’ then we would spend a week or a few days on that subject and just picked up the pieces where she didn’t have any memory of doing certain subjects that were in the curriculum.”


  Cham-Klein said normally they would be going to the library and borrowing French books.


  “But of course we couldn’t do that, (due to the COVID-19 closure), so we ended up going to the (school’s) online resources and contacted our school librarian,” she said.

The unclothed female body is a powerful site of protest. By protesting naked, women have resurrected traditional forms of sociopolitical protests and resistance like the custom common among Igbo women known as “sitting on a man” or “making war” with men. This custom was a practice where women showed their disapproval of abusive men, men who failed to provide for their family or who disregarded market rules. Dressed as men in preparation for war, the women wore only loincloths with ferns on their heads, smeared ashes on their faces and carried sticks with palm fronds. They would dance around the house singing lewd and insulting songs that questioned the offender’s manhood, and would pound on the house using their pestles and in severe cases, destroyed the house. They would continue this activity until the offender repented. This act was viewed as the ultimate means by which women sanctioned wrongdoers.
