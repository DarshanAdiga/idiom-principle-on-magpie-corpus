Yesterday I tweeted the German court ruling was an opportunity to buy a dip in Europe. Italian bonds widened. On previous form, any European mis-speaking or dissent is followed by some furious back-peddling and mumble-swerve, quickly allowing the issue to be kicked further down the road. You then wait for Italy to tighten, sell, and wait for the next crisis to buy them back cheaper. Eat, Sleep, Repeat.

In March 2019, the merger between Walt Disney Studios and 21st Century Fox was completed, and amidst the depressing news about massive layoffs one silver lining that was emphasized was the fact that all of Fox’s Marvel characters are now under the domain of Marvel Studios. It’s since been confirmed that there are plans in the works that will see the integration of these heroes and villains (most notably the X-Men and Fantastic Four) into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what hasn’t been made clear is when it will actually happen.

If I were to look at one EPC player, I would look at L&T;, says the Complete Circle Consultants Co-Founder & CEO.    What is your view on NIIT earnings?What was impressive was that obviously margins came at about 18%. Other than that, there was an over $180-million deal win. Also, for the next 12 months the executable deals were a little excess of $460 million. Also, they allayed to a certain extent, the impact of their exposure to aviation and some of the other sectors which have been badly hit by the lockdown and restricted mobility.    In fact, the guidance by far was the most positive amongst all IT companies which have declared numbers so far. Anything in this market which is a ray of hope in terms of better guidance and better execution in tough times will get rewarded and that is why the price action on the stock.    The government may offload its SUUTI stake in both Axis and ITC. That may happen as soon as this week or early next week. Given the kind of market environment, the nature of this stake sale would be a lot different and there will be few takers given the stock price performance that we have seen in the last three months.It looks like that and it could be more strategic. While Reliance has shown that even in times like these, you can get marquee names, it should be more strategic in nature.    In fact, talks of stake sale in ITC and Axis have been gaining prominence since NDA-2 came to power in 2014. At that time, the valuation even at market price, could have been 2.5-3 times more. Also, in the last 12-14 years, every year we have seen an excise duty hike on tobacco products and to a certain extent we have seen that there is relative inelasticity. I am not saying that demand will be completely inelastic to price changes but both for alcohol and tobacco, there has been a year-on-year increase in excise.    My sense is that the stock correcting after going up to Rs 189-190 levels back to Rs 150-160 range means it is entering an attractive zone. What probably has happened in the last one, one and a half year is that the volume growth has not come and the growth in revenue is largely because of the price hikes ITC has undertaken, because of which the margin between the high-end imported brands and their top brands has shrunk and that is one cause of worry.    But if there is an excise duty increase across the board, it would still be able to weather it. So a strategic sale would be the right way to go and I think the stock is entering a relatively attractive zone for long-term investors.    Coming to consumption stocks, FMCG stocks continue to look expensive. QSR stocks like Jubilant Food Works continues to get preferential treatment from the market. Will you still get into some of these stocks regardless of the PE multiples?Yes, selectively I will. If you look at paints and I come from a distribution background with two generations of family in FMCG distribution, I think the companies that manage supply chains better, would eventually come out winners.   By supply chain, I mean both backward integration and integration with the dealer network. Look at what some of the paint companies are doing for the last one month. They are supplying masks and sanitizers to the paint contractors. There are a lot of promotional campaigns these guys are running and they are converting the points of those promotional campaigns into cash and doing transfers.    The dealer inventory in January and February was very good but March spoilt the entire quarter for them. But if you see decorative paints as a sector, for the last 10-12 years despite disruptions like demonetisation, GST, various crude related events, the decorative segment has always managed to clock 11-12% growth. Typically, it has grown at 1.5 times to 1.6 times your GDP number.   My sense is once the lockdown extends, the repainting cycles will start very quickly. Obviously, there is an issue of labour going back and it will take a bit of a lag to come back and that has to be dealt with.    The sooner you can get your supply chains in order, the better it will be.   Also, companies like Asian Paints are focussing a lot on the rural side. They are pushing because around 70% of the districts are orange and green and are largely rural. If you do the breakup, they are now pushing the lower end products like emulsions, distempers, putty and some of the other products which are of low value since there are some relaxations in the rural area.    So how well you manage the supply chain in times like these would decide how quickly they cover up. I may not want to buy them at this price but any corrections would be a welcome addition to add paints .  Also FMCG companies like Dabur, Britannia, Varun Beverages had a very decent set of numbers this week. They have done well in seasonally weak quarters which are October to December, with great migration to the juice segment, very profitable product mix. The acquisition of south and west territories will add value and they are talking of some 500 to 600 million cases. Summer is the best quarter for beverage companies. It is a very cyclical business. These are some of the plays I would be looking at in terms of adding on dips.    What is your take on BHEL? They have been looking at unlocking value, leveraging some of their assets and the stock has certainly lost a lot of investor confidence. The power sector has been in the doldrums. What is in store for BHEL and what to expect from this segment? Not very confident to be honest. My view is that obviously the price points are attractive but they have been attractive now for two-three years now. So that is an avoid for us as far as recommending to clients or adding in our portfolio is concerned.    If I talk about the broader EPC segment, one stock which we are looking to keep on our watch list and looking at adding is L&T.; My sense is you will see a lot of mid-sized EPC players facing a lot of challenges. It is not just about order execution, there will be severe challenges on working capital and L&T; with its diversified business has the ability to ride through this.    Their order wins have been fairly decent. In order to come out of these kinds of recessionary trends, a massive government capex on roads and other sectors will be needed. Also their service revenue division has been fungible and they have shown great signs of adapting to these particular trends.    So if I were to look at one EPC player, I would look at L&T;, available at about 14 times current year’s earnings. Anyways earnings have no meaning this year. If I take next year's earnings assuming there is a recovery, you are probably getting it at 10-11 times and proven track record. So at Rs 800 odd levels, that is a better play to look at from a long term and fundamental basis.     Even pre Covid, Bharti Airtel was one of the favorites in telecom. Do you buy Bharti even at these levels and hold it for another one year hoping for a good returns or do you think a large part of the rally is actually behind us?It is now almost back to pre-Covid levels. Maybe 5% here and there in terms of price. My view is that there are two scenarios right now. One, looking at the way Vodafone paid up some part of the dues, I think the government is keen on three private players and one PSU player kind of scenario in telecom and in that case, it clearly looks like there will be tariff hikes of anywhere between 15% to 20-25%. That scenario probably would be just good enough. So if Voda-Idea has to survive, there has to be tariff hikes. So they will use any additional jump in ARPUs to basically survive but the gainer would be Bharti and Jio.    The second scenario which looks unlikely but assuming that Voda doesn’t survive and we are finally left with two private players, even then Bharti gains because amongst 7-8 circles. Voda is very weak vis-à-vis Bharti and there will be disproportionate gain in market share. This quarter’s numbers could be a little soft because we have seen that the subscriber additional will get stalled. The digital recharges are only 40% in the low income group. So in lockdown, they have extended the validity, they have given a Rs 10 talk time. That means that at the lower end there will be an impact. There could be marginal impact even because of currency and the African operations because of crude and currency movement.    But it is the high subscriber base which could probably make up for it and my sense is the number of subscribers will go up, the ARUPs will go up. In fact my call is that over a year from now, you could be looking at 180 to 200 bucks ARPU for Bharti and Jio which could translate to 35 crore subscribers and a Rs 30-40 jump in ARPU over one year. Earnings probably can go up multiple times. So I would still be positive. Any dips obviously are more than welcome.    We still do not have any news of a stimulus and it is still looking a bit shaky in terms of what we may hear from companies down the line. What would you leave us with today in terms of strategic advice?Two quick things, One is do not ignore fixed income as an asset class. We are in deflationary conditions. You will see significant monetary easing, printing of money which are likely to keep yields and rates lower. Banks have surplus liquidity.   At some point of time, they will also start lending and have some kind of quality credits. Our broad advice is do not ignore fixed income and do not be completely negative on equity.    So Warren Buffett said that never bet against America. We should remember to never bet against the central banks, especially the US Fed and the kind of money they are printing. Things are uncertain. You should buy 50% when things are uncertain and maybe 50% when you have a medical cure and so gradually be a buyer. Have a contingency fund in place but do not be very negative on markets.

I have lived in London, on and off, since coming to college in October 1987. My first visit was around a decade before that, with my mum and dad, when I was about 10. Only two things stick in my mind from that day. One was the awesomely terrible old taxi rank below Euston station. I had rarely seen a black cab before, let alone hundreds in one place spewing out stuff that, even then, I suspected couldn’t be good for you. The other memories I have are of the tube: the distant rumble, rumbling louder and louder, and the gentle breeze slowly stiffening into a wind as this strange-looking train exploded out of the tunnel. It was the Piccadilly line. I know this, because I remember vividly that the train was bound for somewhere called Cockfosters. Four decades on, it pains me that I have yet to get to Cockfosters.

Mainstream media’s purpose is to report on current events, and while this may be what they are doing, their slant toward reporting on politics and criminal behavior takes its toll on the psyche of the nation. CNN and Fox News have reputations of being significantly biased toward a political party, turning them into a source of conflict rather than a dependable way to educate people about current events. Late-night talk shows with Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert or Conan O’Brien report the news in a comedic fashion, which is more popular amongst young people than regular news outlets. Yet even with the comedic element, the stories still revolve mostly around political polarization or celebrity scandals. With SGN, John Krasinski has lit a torch that will eventually lead us to the light at the end of the tunnel.

None of this is to deny that there is room for ESG-based investment strategies. If investors want to base their stock selection in whole or in part on ESG criteria, that is, of course, up to them, and if investment companies wish to market ESG-compliant funds, that’s fine. Funds that will not invest in companies that, say, sell guns or alcohol have been around for a long time. ESG-compliant funds are simply an extension of the entirely reasonable idea that investors should not be forced to choose between their principles and smart investment. The more choice that such investors have the better.

You’ll start the match off by choosing to play as one of ten unique hunters, each with their own skills and abilities. During the match, hunters can find and collect “essence” which will allow them to level up abilities and grow their strength. Crucible will launch with three game modes, Hearth of the Hives which sees teams fight against massive “hives” in a race to collect some kind of special “hearts”. Harvester Command is basically a control point style of game and Alpha Hunters is your standard elimination match featuring eight two-player teams facing off to be the last squad alive. Battle royale, on a very small scale, essentially. Sound enough like Battleborn yet?

And part of this is due to the “algorithms” that drive people deeper into extremist content. In a lecture to the Royal Institution, educator Tom Scott notes, “it seems as if you are never ‘hardcore’ enough for YouTube’s algorithm.” Similarly, TikTok has repeatedly been under fire for being a breeding ground for political content, with absolutely no way to check the factuality of claims made. All this, while using human moderators to suppress content from users who fit the categories of “chubby… obese” or “[u]gly facial looks”.

Ovviamente tutto ciò non basta ma è una base di partenza, una parte di ciò che come Amministrazione possiamo e intendiamo fare. Il resto spetta al Governo, a partire dalla definizione chiara delle misure che gli esercenti dovranno adottare fino all’individuazione di meccanismi capaci di salvare un settore dal quale dipende la vita di migliaia di famiglie”.

Prize money is the biggest single cost for F1, which is listed on the Nasdaq. It represents 68% of F1’s profit which is expected to reverse sharply this year from the $1.5bn that it generated in 2019. The first indication of this will come on Thursday when Liberty announces its results for the three months to the end of March.              The payment should support the teams during the downturn as prize money is their biggest single source of revenue, followed by sponsorship. Both usually depend on races taking place but Liberty has had to postpone or cancel 10 of the 22 on the calendar due to the pandemic.              According to Zak Brown, boss of the McLaren team, Liberty is paying the prize money in full anyway. The teams received a payment forecast before the pandemic began and Brown says that “Liberty is paying out against their forecast. They are paid up 100%.”              It is believed that the prize money payments are being funded with a $1.4bn windfall that F1 received last month when it transferred a 33% stake in event promoter Live Nation to another division of Liberty. “I think the move they made to put $1.4bn of cash into the bank was the responsible thing to do and they are not living in denial,” said Brown.              However, he adds that the teams still won’t have an easy ride as “it is going to be really tough” to find sponsors.               Brown said he thinks it is “achievable” for racing to resume in July and added that F1 “is looking like the first race will be in Austria. We will have a couple of races there then a couple in the UK at Silverstone. All behind closed doors. If that can all go off without a hitch I think you have got some momentum and energy back.”

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Several weeks ago, Debbie Cameron saw her grandsons most days, playing the piano, making after-school snacks or singing nursery rhymes with the baby in her Chandler, Arizona, home.                           Then the coronavirus crisis hit and the boys were suddenly gone. Cameron is 68 and has asthma, making her one of the people most at risk of getting seriously ill or dying. Now she sees her grandchildren from behind the glass of a window or a phone screen.                           "Looking at them through the window and not being able hug them, it's just a dang killer," she said.                           For grandparents all over the world, being protected from the pandemic has meant a piercing distance from their loved ones. While children don't seem to be getting seriously ill as often, they can be infected and spread the virus. It's been a jolting change for many.                           Cameron and her husband, both retired teachers, usually watch their older grandchildren, aged 8 and 11, after school and their 7-month-old baby grandson four times a week. One of their three daughters is due to have another child in July.                           But as the effects of coronavirus spread, the family decided that caring for the boys was too risky. While most people who catch the disease suffer from symptoms like fever and cough and recover in a few weeks, some get severely ill with things like pneumonia. COVID-19 can be fatal, and older people who have underlying conditions like Cameron are the most vulnerable.                           So instead of chasing after little boys, she's doing puzzles, listening to old radio shows or watching the Hallmark channel, trying to fill the hours in her much-quieter house. "I just go day by day, and when the dark thoughts come in I try and do something to take them away," she said. "I cry. Sometimes I cry."                           Still, she feels lucky she doesn't have to leave the house to work, and that she has close family ties. Sometimes she re-reads a letter her mother wrote her father while he was deployed to the Philippines during World War II, laying out her raw emotions about how much she missed him as she cared for their first child without him. "My mother is a really strong woman, and in this one she was struggling," she said. "If my mom did that, I can do this."                           The sudden change has been challenging for kids' parents too, many of whom are trying to work from home and balance childcare. Cameron's daughter Julie Bufkin is at home with her 7-month-old son, Calvin, working from home as a project coordinator at Arizona State University while her husband goes into the office as an analytical chemist for Intel.                           She's been taking webcam calls and answering emails while breastfeeding the baby and trying to keep him entertained, even after coming down with a fever and headache, symptoms similar to the new coronavirus. In line with the advice of public-health officials, she stayed at home to recover and wasn't tested for the virus, since she's young and healthy and didn't become seriously ill. She's now on the mend, but it only deepened her mother's feelings of helplessness.                           "Imagine if your child is sick you can't go help them," Cameron said. "That's the hardest part."                           But for her daughter, it further confirmed that staying physically separate for now is the right decision.                           "We want my mom to survive this," Bufkin said.                           And the grandparents can still step in remotely -- Bufkin sets up a phone or a tablet in Calvin's playpen, where they can sing songs, show him around the yard, look at the cat or play piano over FaceTime.                           "Anything we can, even five to 10 minutes to give her a little rest. That makes my day," Cameron said.                           They're only 5 miles away in suburban Phoenix, and for a time Bufkin was dropping off food weekly, then touching hands or exchanging kisses through the window. More often, they're sharing their lives through a phone or tablet screen.                           The baby watches his grandparents on the screen, looking up from his own games to smile and laugh at his grandpa or focus on his grandmother playing the saxophone.                           Other grandparents are also looking for moments of brightness. They're replacing chats on the porch with friends with Facebook conversations, or connecting with church congregations through video-messaging apps like Marco Polo.                           Others are turning the technological clock back. Margret Boes-Ingraham, 72, used to drive her 14-year-old granddaughter to choir practice a few times a week near Salt Lake City, then stay to listen to her sing. Without those rides spent listening to show tunes, she's encouraging her granddaughter to keep a journal.                           "I asked her if I could read, and she said no!" Boes-Ingraham said with a laugh.                           For grandparents who live alone, hunkering down during the crisis can increase their isolation. Terry Catucci is a 69-year-old retired social worker and recovering alcoholic of 30 years in Maryland. She has seven grandchildren nearby in the Washington, D.C., area including a 5-year-old and a 1-year-old who she helps care for sometimes. She tries not to think about the little changes she's missing during the years when children seem to grow every day.                           "When you're in a time of crisis, you want to be with people you love, and we can't," she said. "I've run the whole gamut of the five stages of grief at any given day."                           But she's getting by, talking with her family and checking in daily with her Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor. Every night, neighbors in her retirement community set up lawn chairs at the end of driveways to chat with friends walking by at a safe distance.                           "We're all learning how to survive in this time," she said, "to live a little bit the best we can."

The City of Perry will begin the 2020 Street Improvements project the week of May 4, 2020. The project includes street improvements for nearly 60 blocks of city streets with all streets involved receiving a new asphalt surface. The Iowa DOT will also begin work on the Highway 144 improvements from Highway 141 to the north city limits.                           The contractor hired for the work is Des Moines Asphalt. They are anticipating beginning the work the week of May 4 and will be starting in the southern areas of the city. There will be some minor disruptions to traffic during the construction, however, those will primarily be limited to the daytime hours only. For those homeowners affected, Des Moines Asphalt will be placing door hangers in advance of the project. If you happen to be a resident that has a vehicle parked on the street and you have been notified of street work, please make sure to move your vehicle before the work begins.                           The work will vary in areas of the community with removal of the existing surface, pavement patching and installation of a new asphalt surface. There will be traffic barricades up while work is happening on the selected streets. Access will be limited during the time when work is occurring but will be open again for traffic at the end of the day. For everyone's safety and to help the contractors build a great street, please be respectful of the barricades and avoid the construction areas as much as possible. The duration of the project is expected to last one month.                           The project cost is over $1,015,300 and is being funded by the City of Perry's one cent Local Option Sales Tax and the 10 cent fuel tax increase approved by State of Iowa in 2015. It is important to city leaders to use these funds strictly for street improvements within our community. In order to be financially responsible, a large multi-block project is more cost effective than a smaller overlay project each year. The City's Local Option Sales Tax Funds are used solely for street projects, capital expenditures, grant matching funds and building and grounds maintenance. The City of Perry will continue to schedule multi-block overlay projects in other areas of our community on a regular basis to be paid with Local Option Sales Tax and Road Use Tax funds. The work being completed on Highway 144 is fully funded by the Iowa Department of Transportation.                           If you have questions or concerns about this project, please contact the City of Perry at 515-465-2481 or Jacob Ahrens with Bolton & Menk, Inc. at 515-233-6100.

It's a lousy title - one that isn't explained till just before the end credits run - but it's not a bad movie. Neither, unfortunately, is much of a good movie. Even so, the target audience of female tweens and teens, as well as some slightly older young women, just might eat this up.                  The opening shot, a full-screen close-up on the face of Johanna Morrigan (Beanie Feldstein, from "Lady Bird" and "Booksmart") makes it clear that this is going to be a story about her ... about her insecurities, her dreams, her missteps, and eventually her redemption.                  It's 1993. She's 16, lives with her family in the British town of Wolverhampton, and is an overachiever at school, always writing long-winded essays, much to the consternation of her English teacher. But writing is her passion; the girl can't help it.                  She also has a regular practice of escaping from reality, and spends a great deal of time in her bedroom, having conversations, in a Harry Potter-like manner, with photos and paintings on her wall. And those folks on the wall - Sigmund Freud, Sylvia Plath, and Maria von Trapp among them - are ready to offer some advice, at least in Johanna's head.                  Though the family is close, there are money problems. Breeding border collies doesn't quite pay the bills. On top of that, mom (Sarah Solemani) has a touch of depression, and loose, laidback dad (Paddy Considine, terrific in the role), is a bit of a scoundrel, as well as being a frustrated ex-drummer who still wants to play in a pop band.                  Johanna's hopes are boosted when she hears of an opening to be a rock critic at the (fictional) London fanzine Disc and Music Echo, and even though her taste in music leans toward "Tomorrow" from "Annie," she catches a break, due in part to an assignment that no one at the magazine wants, and gets a gig covering a concert.                  But first, she decides to reinvent herself, physically changing her appearance and wardrobe from the relatively bland Johanna Morrigan to the glitzy, lipsticked, top-hatted Dolly Wilde. From that point on, every scene, and almost every moment of the movie, rests on the shoulders of Feldstein, who goes at it with a big dose of frenetic energy and a winning smile. Her dream is coming true, she lands more review assignments, and she tries for a step up the freelance ladder by asking to write a feature - and getting a yes.                  This leads to a third strong performance in the film - after those of Feldstein and Considine - and the introduction of pop star and singer of sad songs John Kite (Alfie Allen, Theon from "Game of Thrones"), who is to be her first interview subject (and it turns out that Allen is a very good singer!).                  Complications arise, the term "off the record" might not be quite clear to the novice interviewer, emotions veer out of control, things go badly, and a John Kite poster starts talking to her, attempting to help her out of the problems she inadvertently creates for herself. One of them involves the changes she finds herself going through. Her magazine wants tough stories, not fawning pieces, and Johanna plunges down a dark hole that results in new, not very pleasant personalities taking root in her. Her profiles and reviews turn nasty, her attitude toward her family becomes one of a jerk, she becomes recognized for her "toxic writing," and she's proud of it.                  She morphs into a protagonist that no one will be rooting for, not even that young target audience. Most of this works quite well in a dramatic sense. But some lazy writing late in the film leads to a lame plot twist that turns everything around too conveniently, with wrongs being righted too easily.                  For a brief moment, the film again finds its footing, with Alfie Allen's acting range saving the day, but then we get an unnecessary breaking of the fourth wall at the very end with a message delivered to anyone still interested - those young girls again - to be yourself. That lesson was already there, in the words of the characters. It sure didn't need to be given twice.              "How to Build a Girl" premieres on VOD platforms on May 8.

The Director of Campus Sustainability, Victor Udo, is now reopening the draft Plan for feedback and planning a public forum on an updated version in August. As a campus community, we need to take advantage of this additional time to make sure University decision-makers know that buying their way to carbon neutrality, ignoring environmental justice, and doing nothing about transitioning off fossil fuels, does not fit into a model of true sustainability.

Hill, who works full-time on the Marine base in Twentynine Palms, said he used his time off from work to make the repairs.          “I’m the only one out there,” Hill said, stressing there was no way to have exposure to COVID-19. “Everything we do is volunteer.”          The naturally sandy track gets slammed with wet weather every rainy season and the repairs were much needed, Hill said in a phone interview on April 30.          “So much got done,” he said. “It looks amazing. It’s a whole new track.”          Local rider Kuylee Pettit, 14, will also soon return to the local track to ride.          Pettit, who lives in Lucerne Valley, is sponsored by Precision BMX and rides nationwide. Her mother, Keri Dillman, is the local track operator.          “It’s one of the better tracks,” Pettit said earlier this year.          Hill said he also hopes the July 4 race will be a huge success and the fireworks from the town of Yucca Valley will be on full view from the track. Plans are also in the works to have a live music performance and possibly a military fly-over during the races.          “It will be a lot of races coming down,” Hill said.          The closure has caused some financial losses, but overall Hill said he is confident they can fully recover.

 ##  RICK & LIBBY’S IS SHIFTING FROM BAR TO RESTAURANT
 Newport News is a close-knit town where most folks know one another or at least know of one another. And one of the spots where numerous friendships were forged over a cold beer and a burger was Mike’s Place, in Warwick Village Shopping Center. In truth, probably more than a few beers accompanied those burgers.
 I too enjoyed some of those brews while living in Newport News in the early ’80s. For 33 years, Mike’s was a popular watering hole where locals went to wind up or down, to celebrate or commiserate marriages and divorces, births and deaths, and everything in between.
 Enter Rick Lugent and Libby MacDonald, who got married on Dec. 31, 2013, and bought Mike’s Place two days later. Two years later, they renamed it Rick & Libby’s.
 Rick graduated from Christopher Newport College, before it gained university status, and was with Domino’s Pizza for 21 years. Libby graduated from N.C. State with a bachelor’s in agronomy and a master’s in crop science. During the week she works for the Virginia Institute of Marine Science at Gloucester Point. But after hours and on weekends, she uses her lab and science skills to win accolades and devotion from customers for the cakes and pies she bakes for the restaurant.
 I spoke by phone to Rick to ask how they were faring during the COVID restrictions. “We were able to take care of our employees with either unemployment or personal loans,” he said. “I figured this is the perfect time to transition from a bar to a restaurant. My 21 years with Domino’s as manager, supervisor and national inspector made me want to open a pizza spot but I didn’t want to own a franchise. Libby has been using her skills to help me with the dough. We don’t have them on the menu yet, but we’ve been selling pizzas that we cook in a convection oven. I had a customer from New York say it was the best pizza he’s ever had. I’ll need to make adjustments to the building to allow for pizza, but now is the perfect opportunity to make the change.”
 The pizza special is a three-topping 16-incher with a New York-style crust for $16.95.

Most English and language arts assignments require work that is below grade level for Columbus City Schools students in grades K-8.
   
 The district's boys and black students are less likely to receive gifted services than their peers, but are the most likely to be expelled from school.
   
 And resources aren't distributed equitably to Columbus schools, either. Some schools with a large number of economically disadvantaged students receive less money per student than schools with less challenges.
   
 The findings weren't easy to read, Columbus City Schools officials say.
   
 But, as they comb through a critical, 450-page curriculum audit, they say the document will help them improve Ohio's largest school district, which has struggled academically for years.
   
 "The hard part comes now, with the work that we need to do," Columbus Board of Education member Eric Brown said Tuesday. "It's all for the benefit of kids."
   
 The board hired Phi Delta Kappa International, a Virgina-based professional organization for educators, to conduct the audit. Board members reviewed its findings publicly for the first time Tuesday evening.
   
 Overall, the report emphasized a lack of planning, direction and policies related to a district-wide curriculum. That has led to inequitable, inadequate and inconsistent learning opportunities for students.
   
 Among the concerns highlighted:
   
 • Written curriculum documents do not exist for all core courses in grades K-12. As a result, teachers often turn to other resources to use for instruction, leading to discrepancies between buildings. The quality of documents that do exist is inadequate.
   
 • There are no policies created by the school board or guidelines created by the superintendent that specifically address curriculum development or require teachers deliver the district's curriculum. If district rules conflict with its contract with its teachers union, the Columbus Education Association, the contract takes precedence.
   
 • Most student work requires lower-order cognitive skills and offers little engagement.
   
 • There is little direction for the delivery of instruction to English learners, who comprise 17% of the district population. Both English learners and special education students, also 17% of students, consistently perform below their peers in end-of-year course exams.
   
 • Schools that serve poorer populations have less access to substitute teachers, lower graduation rates and more absenteeism.
   
 • Teacher vacancies across the district are filled based on seniority preference, according to their union's contract, creating inequities among buildings.
   
 • Colerain Elementary School, which mostly serves students with disabilities, is one of the district's most-inadequate learning environments, lacking space for equipment storage and occupational and physical therapy. It is one of 13 schools with no plans to install air-conditioning.
   
 • Officials must gather more data using assessments, beyond the state's mandated tests, and use it to monitor the effectiveness of programs and to guide future budgeting and decision-making.
   
 A team of 18 auditors examined documents and conducted interviews and surveys. Some came to the district in early December, visiting 61 schools and 836 classrooms.
   
 The next step is to review the report's recommendations for improvement, prioritize them and create a plan to implement them over the next few years.
   
 The school board has scheduled a virtual meeting for 5 p.m. May 14 to get started.
   
 New Columbus City Schools Superintendent Talisa Dixon said the audit was a top priority of her first school year. In October, board members approved spending nearly $216,000 in federal grants on it.
   
 The final report arrived at a time that was less than ideal, just before the coronavirus pandemic led Gov. Mike DeWine to shutter Ohio's school buildings indefinitely.
   
 "I debated. Do I move forward with this? Or do I say 'This is COVID-19, it can wait?'" Dixon said. "But I knew. It can't."
   
 For example, the audit found that the district's technology plan is dated and insufficient -- but now that Ohio's students are expected to learn remotely due to the coronavirus, preparing for online instruction has become a priority.
   
 And as people are encouraged to keep their distance from each other to prevent the virus from spreading, school buildings operating beyond capacity could become an issue. The report found that 22% of district buildings have enrollment past capacity, however, 21% of buildings are operating at just 75% capacity.
   
 Some fixes are already in the works.
   
 For example, starting next school year, the district will employ a chief equity officer, a person who will monitor programs to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of employees and students, Dixon said.
   
 In January, board members approved spending nearly $400,000 in federal grants to implement Fundations, a K-3 literacy program, districtwide.
   
 This school year marks the fourth time that Columbus City Schools has received a curriculum audit. The others were in 1979, 1999 and 2005.
   
 Many findings are recurring issues.
   
 "We have to figure out a way, within our organization, to keep these priorities front and center," Dixon said. "These recommendations have to become a part of our culture."

Tucked in the bottom of Alabama football game contracts is a paragraph that seemed almost comical in the past.          These 60 words sound like something from a movie -- a list of wild unforeseen circumstances that could impact the playing of a 60-minute football game.          They seemed outrageous right up through the middle of March.          Now, this contract clause has the potential to impact the hypothetical scenarios in which a 2020 college football season would be played in the coronavirus era.          Known as the force majeure (or act of god) clause, the paragraph could conceivably give one side of a non-conference game contract a way out of the deal without penalty. Since a conference-only schedule is among the ideas being thrown around, these 60 words could be important.          The standardized contract Alabama has with non-conference opponents Georgia State, Kent State and Tennessee-Martin reads as follows:           _“In the event of fire, flood, hurricane, war, invasion, hostilities, rebellion, insurrection, confiscation by order of government, military or public authority or prohibitory or governmental authority, including that of the Southeastern Conference or the National Collegiate Athletic Association, making it impossible or impractical to play the game, both parties shall be relieved of any and all obligations of this agreement.”_           Alabama has committed to pay these three teams $3.55 million for their participation in games scheduled for the renovated Bryant-Denny Stadium this fall. The payouts fund significant portions of the smaller schools’ budget and the cancellation of those games could be significant.          An Alabama spokesperson said the school was not speculating if the clause would have any impact on the fall schedule. Athletics director Greg Byrne said April 23 on Twitter that the school is “planning to play our fall sports seasons” while consulting health experts.          Officials from Georgia State, Kent State and Tennessee-Martin said last week they had not heard anything about changes in the plans to play Alabama this fall.          Gregg Clifton is a lawyer in Arizona actively working with conferences and universities dealing with exactly this topic and variations of this clause.          “If you tried to cancel it today, I think you’d lose,” said Clifton of Jackson Lewis P.C. in Phoenix. “I think the use of that clause in April or May for a game in September is slightly premature.”          Most of his clients are taking a “look and see approach” at this point. The June 15-July 1 window will be telling if there will be any action with these clauses as all sides assess the projections with another month-plus of data and potential medical progress.          Martin Greenberg, a 40-year veteran of sports law, said this clause could be enforceable if Alabama or any school was looking for a way out of these games because of the pandemic. The key wording in Alabama’s contract isn’t the listing of specific events (war, invasion, hostilities, rebellion, insurrection), but the “making it impossible or impractical to play the game” part.          “That might be the catch all for a judge or a court to say that’s exactly what was intended to encompass all of those things that should be in these force majeure clauses moving forward,” Greenberg said.          Where this could become an issue is if conference games were played and these contract games scrapped. The non-SEC teams would have a defense, if it came down to a legal fight, if Alabama played some games under “the same or similar circumstances,” Greenberg said, when others were canceled.          “It will be interesting to see what unfolds here from a legal perspective because I can think of a lot of different results,” Greenberg said. “But just remember these clauses, because they excuse performance, are strictly construed. I use my best interpretive language that the clause could be enforced and it’s not the naming of a specific event.”          There could be other legal remedies should this come to a dispute, Greenberg said. Concepts like “frustration of purpose” and “material adverse changes” deal with unforeseen circumstances and could be argued.          Clifton said he’s working on a more detailed clause for his clients that specifically covers infectious diseases and outbreaks like the coronavirus. It also includes a resurgence clause in case things worsen after they improve.          “If you want to cover your ass in a force majeure clause,” Clifton said, “that’s what you’ve got to do. Brevity is not your best bet with a force majeure clause because it’s the specific acts that you want be sure is covered.”          There’s also the possibility of cancellation insurance to cover losses. Wimbledon received a $123.7 million payout from a policy when the 2020 summer tournament was canceled because of the coronavirus.          Force majeure clauses obviously rarely come into play but Clifton noted one potential remedy with recent precedence. A 2018 Nebraska-Akron football game canceled because of bad weather after both teams arrived at the stadium. Nebraska ultimately paid Akron $650,000 of the original $1.17 million contract and agreed to play a 2025 game for a $1.45 million payday.          Clifton said he could see similar deals being made for 2020 games. Alabama doesn’t have any holes in its future schedules until 2023 and no season has multiple vacancies before 2027.          Alabama is scheduled to play a fourth non-conference game in 2020 against USC in the opener. A review of the contract Alabama signed in 2018 with Cowboys Stadium LP and ESPN Productions Inc., does not appear to have any force majeure language. It does, however, note the $6 million participation fee would be paid five business days after the game set for Sept. 5 in the Arlington, Texas home of the Dallas Cowboys.          That paycheck would account for 3.5 percent of the four-year revenue average for Alabama’s athletics department. Any cancellation of the non-conference games would have a significantly larger impact on the bottom line of schools like Georgia State, Kent State and Tennessee Martin.          The $1.75 million Alabama is set to pay Kent State represents 25.3 percent of the football revenue the MAC school made, according to the most recent budget filing with the U.S. Department of Education. In terms of the entire Kent State athletics revenue before adding student fees, the Alabama game is 9.2 percent of the last budget.          And that’s before the coronavirus wreaked havoc on athletic department finances. For reference, the $1.75 million Alabama would pay Kent State is 0.94 percent of its 2019 expenses.

          The City of Perry will begin the 2020 Street Improvements project the week of May 4, 2020. The project includes street improvements for nearly 60 blocks of city streets with all streets involved receiving a new asphalt surface. The Iowa DOT will also begin work on the Highway 144 improvements from Highway 141 to the north city limits.          The contractor hired for the work is Des Moines Asphalt. They are anticipating beginning the work the week of May 4 and will be starting in the southern areas of the city. There will be some minor disruptions to traffic during the construction, however, those will primarily be limited to the daytime hours only. For those homeowners affected, Des Moines Asphalt will be placing door hangers in advance of the project. If you happen to be a resident that has a vehicle parked on the street and you have been notified of street work, please make sure to move your vehicle before the work begins.          The work will vary in areas of the community with removal of the existing surface, pavement patching and installation of a new asphalt surface. There will be traffic barricades up while work is happening on the selected streets. Access will be limited during the time when work is occurring but will be open again for traffic at the end of the day. For everyone's safety and to help the contractors build a great street, please be respectful of the barricades and avoid the construction areas as much as possible. The duration of the project is expected to last one month.          The project cost is over $1,015,300 and is being funded by the City of Perry's one cent Local Option Sales Tax and the 10 cent fuel tax increase approved by State of Iowa in 2015. It is important to city leaders to use these funds strictly for street improvements within our community. In order to be financially responsible, a large multi-block project is more cost effective than a smaller overlay project each year. The City's Local Option Sales Tax Funds are used solely for street projects, capital expenditures, grant matching funds and building and grounds maintenance. The City of Perry will continue to schedule multi-block overlay projects in other areas of our community on a regular basis to be paid with Local Option Sales Tax and Road Use Tax funds. The work being completed on Highway 144 is fully funded by the Iowa Department of Transportation.          If you have questions or concerns about this project, please contact the City of Perry at 515-465-2481 or Jacob Ahrens with Bolton & Menk, Inc. at 515-233-6100.          "

"Pur accogliendo con favore la sensibilità dimostrata da questi operatori nel subordinare le loro richieste di un sostegno economico all'esigenza di operare con tranquillità per poter garantire un servizio ed una maggiore sicurezza – conclude Andrea Costa - come Liguria Popolare ci sentiamo di farci parte attiva per sostenere le loro legittime richieste presso la Regione, che si è sempre dimostrata attenta alle necessità di un settore fondamentale per intere zone della Liguria, ma soprattutto al Governo perché tenga presente la particolarità di questa realtà economica e non scarichi il problema sugli Enti Locali. Non è accettabile che un imprenditore sia costretto a tenere chiusa la propria azienda non perché lui non sia in grado di garantire il rispetto delle disposizioni che lo Stato,  prima o poi, gli darà, ma perché quello stesso Stato non è capace di farlo operare in piena sicurezza, nei confronti dei suoi clienti e dei suoi dipendenti".

"They stabilise, they boost morale - if they score runs, everyone else's moral is up. If they are out cheaply you almost sense that on the field that everyone 'now we all have to step up'.

_Milano, 06 mag 15:02 - (Agenzia Nova)_ - "Dopo il telefono 'anti-solitudine' avviato subito all'inizio del lockdown, abbiamo potenziato il nostro sistema di 'sportello' da 'remoto' con nuovi numeri che tutti potranno chiamare per ricevere aiuto ricevere aiuto psicologico, aiuto con le nuove tecnologie, aiuto legale". Lo fa sapere in una nota il presidente del Municipio 4 Paolo Guido Bassi insieme al suo assessore alle Politiche sociali Marco Rondini. L'iniziativa - spiegano - è stata resa possibile grazie alla collaborazione con Spazio Ginkgo che ci ha consentito, per un'ora al giorno dal lunedì al venerdì, di avere degli operatori/professionisti a disposizione gratuita per i cittadini. "Sottolineiamo – affermano Bassi e Rondini – il servizio di sostegno psicologico, aperto a tutti, ma avviato pensando soprattutto agli operatori del sociale, ad esempio i volontari di realtà di assistenza, come la nostra Croce d'Oro, che in queste settimane sono stati particolarmente provati dai numerosi interventi nelle case dei malati di Covid-19. Ma anche il servizio di orientamento alle nuove tecnologie, utili per non dire indispensabili, in un periodo caratterizzato dall'esigenza di distanziamento sociale".

Seven weeks of locked doors, shuttered cash registers and idle hands have taken a toll on small businesses and their employees around the state.          Another 70,552 Massachusetts workers filed for unemployment benefits in the last weekly cycle, the feds said, bringing the total number of people seeking help -- 893,607 -- to close to a quarter of the state's workforce.          But could April showers yield to May flowers?          "We'll have more to say about that one ... in plenty of time for Mother's Day," Gov. Charlie Baker said Thursday.          The governor was talking specifically about a request that florists and other types of similar businesses be allowed to send at least one employee back to work to take and fulfill orders for delivery.          Most offices, however, will remain locked through at least May 18 as the governor extended his orders closing all non-essential businesses to employees, customers and the public and restricting public gatherings to 10 people or fewer for another two weeks.          Weeks into the COVID-19 state of emergency and with new infections still pouring in, Baker also issued a new order on Friday requiring all people in public to wear a mask or face covering if they are unable to socially distance themselves, putting weight behind what had just been a strong recommendation up to this point.          The governor described the facial covering order as part of the preparation for a "new normal." The idea that some relief might be coming from the strict limits on business operations marked a significant turning point in Massachusetts as Baker had finally seen enough to initiate the conversation about what a reopening of the economy might look like.          Massachusetts continues to sit on a very high plateau of coronavirus infections, with new cases, and deaths (3,562 as of Thursday) mounting each day. But a plateau is better than being on the up-slope of Everest.          Hospitalizations have stabilized. Testing capacity has expanded, some. And Baker said Friday the metrics have "moved a little bit in the right direction." The governor called a shipment of ventilators from New Jersey an "insurance policy" rather than a necessity.          But Massachusetts is still not where some other states are, like Texas, where citizens are being encouraged to start emerging from their houses.          Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito has been put in charge of a working group of 17 business leaders from different corners of the state's economic ecosystem to help develop a plan to phase the reopening of commerce from Boston to the Berkshires with proper safety protocols in place to protect both workers and consumers.          Polito's group got to work seeking input from impacted sectors, none of them hurt more by the coronavirus outbreak than retailers. The Retailers Association of Massachusetts presented Wednesday and made an ask that the administration not wait until May 18 to let some companies bring employees back to work in locked stores.          Hence, the governor's comments about florists.          And Senate President Karen Spilka told the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce that any plan to reopen the economy had to include a plan for day care centers to begin providing childcare again for working parents.          Spilka said the looming budget crisis will prevent the state from coming close to paying for universal child care, but she asked the business community to join her in a conversation about public-private partnerships to elevate child care and early education on the agenda.          The Ashland Democrat also said the pandemic had potentially created an opportunity to repair the state's aging public transit system before it returned to full operational capacity, and said she had asked Sen. Joseph Boncore to convene an oversight hearing about what it will take to safely reopen the T, regional buses and the commuter rail.          But Baker, Polito, Spilka and retailers weren't the only ones trying to navigate the new rules of the road.          Like teenagers with learners permits, legislators have spent the past month driving around the high school parking lot. While that went decently, merging onto the highway has proven to be a bit more harrowing.          House Speaker Robert DeLeo released a set of emergency rules this week that would allow the House to hold formal sessions with members who don't want to be in the chamber voting remotely by sending in their votes to monitors, and signing up to debate bills in advance.          While the Legislature has managed to pass some bills in informal sessions during the quarantine era by building overwhelming consensus, some bills require roll call votes.          The new rules were supposed to be used Thursday to pass Gov. Baker's bill to authorize short-term borrowing to ensure that government services are funded during the COVID-19 pandemic. But you know what they say about the best-laid plans.          An initial fire over increasing the threshold of support to force a roll call vote was quickly doused, but Republicans continued to object to the process DeLeo and his leadership team have laid out for debating bills that will include the fiscal 2021 budget.          Minority Leader Brad Jones objects to the idea that lawmakers would sign up the morning of a debate to speak on legislation and get one bite at the apple, regardless of what gets said after them. And so the House went into the weekend without an emergency rules package approved, and only a glimmer of hope that Monday would bring resolution.          Jones said after he brought Thursday's informal session to an end that there had been "helpful back and forth that I hope will continue tomorrow and over the weekend to allow us to get to a place that we can move forward on the order."          If that's not the case, a House source told the News Service that Speaker DeLeo was making preparations to have Democrats -- who outnumber Republicans more than 4-to-1 -- physically come to the State House for a formal session to adopt the emergency rules.          Markings had been laid out on the floors outside the chamber six feet apart to inform proper social distancing etiquette. The tape markings snaked from the entrance to the House chamber, down the third-floor hallway toward the governor's office, and down the large marble staircase to Nurses Hall.          A point about formal House sessions is needed here: The House in recent years has not exactly been a debating club and representatives have often spent time during formals in their offices or elsewhere or idly chatting on the chamber floor, just passing time until they were called to cast votes.          In the Senate, the process of planning for socially distanced formal sessions seemed to be going a little smoother. And having only 40 members to think about no doubt helped.          Senate President Spilka tapped Majority Leader Cynthia Creem to lead a bipartisan working group of seven senators to craft a plan for a return to formal sessions by early June.          In the meantime, Creem said Spilka had a short-term plan to pass the governor's borrowing bill that would give senators three options for voting -- in person, from their office, or by proxy through another senator.          The Legislature isn't the only group that's been busy trying to figure out how to allow state government and its processes to proceed as normally as possible.          The Supreme Judicial Court two weeks ago slashed signature gathering requirements by half in order to prevent potential candidates from being denied the chance to run because they could not and would not ask volunteers to approach voters in person to sign their papers.          The state's highest court resolved a similar issue last week when it forced an agreement between Secretary of State William Galvin and four ballot campaigns to allow for electronic signatures to be used for the petitioners to collect the more than 13,000 signatures they need in the coming months to place their question before voters in November.          U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, whose campaign admitted to being short before the SJC slashed the requirement, said Thursday night it had blown past both the new requirement (5,000) and the old requirement (10,000) and collected over 23,000 uncertified signatures that it planned to turn in.          The deadline for all state and federal candidates to submit their signatures is next week, when some probably won't make the cut. In the 8th Congressional District, video game designer Brianna Wu said she was bowing out of her primary against Rep. Stephen Lynch not because of signatures, but because of other challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic.          Wu calculated that it would be too difficult for her to successfully take on an incumbent with nearly 19 years in Congress by running an entirely digital campaign socially distanced from the voters she would need to win over.          Lynch still faces a primary challenge from Massachusetts General Hospital physician Robbie Goldstein, the progressive Democrat who helped sue to lower the signature threshold and who has been endorsed by Rep. Nika Elugardo and Mohammed Dar, who for a time was also in the race against the incumbent.

The Tiruverumbur Railway Station has got Adarsh status featuring PRS (Passenger Reservation System), toilet, catering service and waiting room. It has come up at a new location within 200 metres from the old building that has been demolished. But there are encroachment of railway land on the sides of path leading to the newly station.          But residents of Tiruverumbur, BHEL township, Ordnance Factory Estate, HAPP, and Thuvakudi besides Kattur want the authorities to look into the demand for halt of express trains.          “Barring Mayiladuthurai-Mysuru Express, only passenger trains bound for Karaikal, Nagore, Thanjavur, and Mayiladuthurai stop at the station. Stoppage of express trains to Ernakulam, Chennai and Coimbatore is a necessity as there are places of tourism and pilgrim significance like Grand Anicut, Erumbeeswarar Temple and Thirunedunkulam Temple,” said N. Anbazhagan, president, Tamil Nadu Makkal Valarchi Kuzhu.           A delegation of the Kuzhu submitted a petition to the Tiruchi MP P. Kumar recently when he visited the station along with Senior Divisional Commercial Manager Arun Thomas Kalathikal and Minister Valarmathi.          Shanmugavelu, advisor of the Kuzhu, said the delegation assured the authorities that the patronage for the Tiruverumbur station would be phenomenal in the event of enforcing stoppage of express trains.           The need for rail passengers in these localities to travel for 10 to 15 km to board trains at Tiruchi Junction will be obviated. Stoppage of express trains at Tiruverumbur station will contribute to reducing traffic density along heavily congested Thanjavur Highway, K. Murali, Additional General Manager, BHEL, said.          According to sources, the demand is under consideration and a decision on the issue will hinge on two factors: track doubling and commercial justification.          The track doubling has been covered so far till Solakampatti. Once the process is completed over the next few months in the remaining stretch along Alakkudi and Budalur stations till Thanjavur, the possibility will be considered factoring in the reduction in the running time between Tiruchi and Thanjavur.           In all probability, the demand will have a reflection in the new chart in the latter part of next year, it is learnt.

If this game were to happen, it means the 2020 NFL season would both start and end in Tampa since Raymond James Stadium will be hosting Super Bowl LV. Of course, if the NFL is concerned that Brady might not be in sync with his new teammates in time to go toe-to-toe with Mahomes in Week 1, the Chiefs also play at New Orleans and Baltimore, and both of those games would also make for an attractive opener, but again, it would involve the Chiefs playing on the road. The good news for the NFL is that if you're going to break tradition and send the defending Super Bowl champ on the road, this is the year to do it. After all, this has been a year of total craziness and no one will bat an eye if you decide to throw a curveball and buck tradition for the opener.
