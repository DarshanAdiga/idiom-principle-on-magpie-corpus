The series was very much expected to go down to the wire but with the way the Australians hammered the hosts in the series opener, it seemed the tourists would run away with their second straight series win in India. However, India showed commendable character in Rajkot to level the series, proving that the panic buttons were pressed prematurely following the 10-wicket loss in Mumbai.

Last Wednesday marked exactly 50 years that the Nigerian civil war ended. The war, which claimed an estimated two million people, arose principally due to a tragic mismanagement of our national affairs by a political and military elite that could not rise above primordial interests. Sadly, half a century after that war, it would seem that the national political leadership has not learnt any lessons, nor has it made the requisite amends that would help in building a stronger Nigeria. Today, our national fault lines have only grown more conspicuous, and are still widening, while the twin factors of bad leadership and abuse of power are still here with us.

Oklahoma junior forward Brady Manek finished with a career-high 31 points on 10-15 shooting including an efficient 7-9 from behind the arc. Manek's seven three-pointers are also a career high.
 Meanwhile, the Horned Frogs struggled heavily with scoring from behind the arc, finishing the game shooting 8-36 from deep. TCU also converted on just 37.7 percent from the field in the loss.
 "It starts with getting a good attack on the ball and making that ball handler a little uncomfortable but they're still really good at it so I thought our guys battled pretty well," Kruger said.
 The Sooners will be looking to build off this win as they take on No. 2 Baylor in Waco on Monday at 8 pm. The game will be televised on ESPN.

Timely 3-pointers in the second half allowed Warsaw to stay ahead of Goshen. As time was running down at the end of the third quarter, Tiger senior Brielle Harrison drained a 30-foot ‘3’ as the buzzer sounded to give Warsaw a 14-point advantage heading into the fourth.
 Goshen was able to cut that deficit to eight two minutes into the final period, but another clutch trey — this time from Lenny’s daughter, sophomore Kacilyn Krebs — made it a double-digit lead once again for Warsaw.
 “Anytime you can keep it double digits, keep it three possessions or more in the NLC, you’re probably in better shape than when you let it get down to six or so,” Lenny Krebs said.
 The RedHawks made it a single-digit game only one more time in the final five minutes after that Kacilyn Krebs’ ‘3.’
 Warsaw was led by Harrison’s 11 points. Sophomore Abby Sanner had 10, Kacilyn Krebs six, junior Kensie Ryman and senior Kaylee Patton five each, junior Audrey Grimm four and junior Kendall Wayne one. The Tigers host Homestead Tuesday.
 Goshen junior Brynn Shoup-Hill finished with 13 points and 13 rebounds. Sophomore Tori Eldridge chipped in six points, Kirkton five and Reagan Mast and junior Megan Gallagher two each. The RedHawks travel to Jimtown Tuesday. Now that their chances of winning the NLC are no more, Hill wants to get his team ready for the postseason.
 “We have to remember we still have opportunities to get ready for the tournament,” Hill said. “We still have three more game-type practices to get ready for the tournament. It’s a tough sectional where we could see pretty much anyone we’ve lost to right now, and then we have Penn and Elkhart Central to worry about. A very strong sectional; we have goals in that.”

The NSIP is undergoing some rejigging. A new ministry has been created, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management. A lot of people are in that programme and they’re civil servants drawn to pilot the affairs. So let’s give them up to the first quarter of 2020, the programme will be repackaged not to disrupt the ongoing one. But definitely, it’s being repackaged because some areas need to be retouched. The same goes for the N-Power programme under the same NSIP. They’re all being rejigged. I do not doubt that we’ll all benefit more at the end of the day. No system is very perfect. We’ll support the idea when it comes to the FEC.

If not for anything else, I know of some northerners and westerners who say that whenever South-East is given the slot, they will lay permanently the ghost of the Nigeria civil war; it would have been buried for life. All the acrimony, bitterness, suspicion would have been buried once and for all and I believe that.

While it was a team effort by the Raiders, the “One for the Thumb” moniker could be changed to “One for the Nethercutts.” Senior Jenna Nethercutt and her sister, freshman Syd Nethercutt, were entered in seven events, and the dynamic duo earned blue ribbons in all seven.
 “The two of them have been big contributors for us all season,” Northridge coach Kyle Hembree said. “Jenna has been battling a bit of an injury, but she was able to defend her individual title from a year ago (100-yard breaststroke). Syd has been a huge player for us. She gets faster every time out.”
 Besides winning the 100 breast title, Jenna was on the winning 200 medley relay and the winning 200 freestyle relay.
 “After the prelims (Thursday night) we knew we were is a good position. We all had amazing swims,” Jenna said.
 Jenna has been dealing with a issue in her right shoulder.
 “Due to the injury she has been doing a lot of work on her legs. She is really strong in her legs and should be ready for a great postseason,” Hembree said.
 Syd won the 200 and 500 freestyles. She was also on the first-place 200 and 400 free relays.
 “Syd has been an important part of our team. I knew coming into the season she could be good, but I didn’t really expect what we have seen from. I’m not sure I was ready for all this,” Hembree said. “She is going what she is doing, because she loves to train and loves to push herself.”
 The coach shared another factor in the youngster’s success.
 “Syd has a great attitude. She always has a smile on her face,” Hembree said.
 Both of the Nethercutt sisters are products of the Northridge feeder system — the Northridge Area Swimming Association — so the pair began their prep careers with big-time meet experience already on their resumes.
 “A meet like this is tougher, since you are swimming more for you team,” Jenna said.
 Joining Jenna Nethercutt on the 200 medley relay were senior Kenzie Weber, sophomore Ingrid Fritz and freshman Americis Ingling.
 Besides Jenna and Syd Nethercutt on the 200 free relay were junior Elsa Fretz and Weber. Joining Syd on the 400 free relay were Elsa Fretz, Ingling and Ingrid Fretz.
 Elsa Fretz was a double individual winner, taking the 50 and 100 freestyles.
 “Elsa continues to swim well for us,” Hembree said. “We are making small tweaks with her. Her times at this point of the season may not be as fast as last season, but that is okay. She is not the level of swimmer that we want to be peaking at this point of the season. I have to keep telling her at the level she is at she is not going to see the big drop in times like some of the other swimmers. She has to take the drops she can get and be happy with what she gets.”
 Hembree, while focusing on the NLC meet, is also looking farther down the road.
 “Today was a statement for us. This was the first step of the journey,” the coach said. “We wanted to send a message to teams we will see at state that we can compete with the bigger schools.”
 Jenna Nethercutt agreed with her coach.
 “Today’s meet should give us confidence for the state meet,” she said.
 The Raiders’ other two wins came in events dominated by Northridge.
 Junior Anna Yeater led a 1-2-3 sweep in the 200 individual medley. Her sister, sophomore Alaina Yeater, was second and sophomore Clare Ritchie third.
 Sophomore Jiselle Miller finished first in diving, with classmate Kaitlin Simons second and junior Mila Opacich fourth.
 Concord had one event winner, as freshman Sophia Stutsman took the top place in the 100 butterfly.
 “I know the girls wanted to swim a lot faster today, but we were not at a level to be competitive with Northridge,” Concord coach Tom Johnson said. “Northridge is a really strong team and we have felt all season long that competing with them as often as we do will make us a better team come state.”
 Wawasee freshman Alexis Mishler won the 100 backstroke.
 Goshen freshman Sam Hunter placed fourth in the 100 butterfly.
 “We have a number of strong swimmers and Sam is one of them,” Goshen coach Mia Miller said.
 Miller is in her first season coaching Goshen where she competed in the sport during her prep days.
