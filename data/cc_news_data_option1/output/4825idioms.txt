There is an acceptance behind the scenes that those with a pre-existing mental illness have found this year almost impossible. But there is also a battle raging within Westminster about the effects of the pandemic on mental health more widely. Mental Health Minister Nadine Dorries has been pushing back against suggestions that suicides have risen recently, and has been keen in parliamentary debates to make a distinction between mental health and mental wellbeing, suggesting that the latter may well suffer as a result of the strain placed on many people by Covid, but that this is different to having a diagnosed mental illness.

Burkina Faso's president, Roch Marc Christian Kabore, notched up a hefty lead Wednesday in results announced from more than half of the country's voting districts following weekend elections.
 Kabore, bidding for a second term at the helm of the troubled Sahel state, has 58.14 percent of the vote, according to the ongoing count conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI).
 Opposition leader Zephirin Diabre has 14.25 percent while Eddie Komboigo, who heads a former ruling party, has 13.62 percent, it said.
 The figures are derived from results from 196 out of the 368 districts, embassies or consulates where votes for Sunday's elections were cast.
 Kabore, 63, is seeking an overall majority from voting day to avoid a runoff in which he would stand against a single candidate backed by a united opposition.
 He has been under fire for his response to a five-year-old jihadist campaign that has rolled in from Mali, claiming at least 1,200 lives and forcing around a million people to flee their homes.
 Sunday's elections were for Burkina's legislature as well as its presidency, where executive power in the former French colony is concentrated.
 Opposition parties say the vote was marked by fraud and flawed procedures. On Monday, they threatened to reject "results stained by irregularities."
 Their complaints include polling stations that either did not open or opened late, insecure handling of ballot boxes and arbitrary changes to voting areas.
 Because of the unrest, the election was not held across at least one-fifth of the territory, denying up to 350,000 people of the right to vote, according to CENI's figures.
 Parties supporting Kabore on Tuesday argued that the problems encountered on Sunday affected "all the competing candidates and political parties" in a similar way.
 The problems were not on a scale to have any major impact on the result, they said, urging all parties to respect the outcome.
 An opposition protest was scheduled to take place early Wednesday outside the vote tabulation centre but was cancelled.
 A joint observer team has been sent by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the United Nations and the African Union (AU).
 It has met with governing and opposition figures in what one of the mission's members described as "preventative diplomacy."

In the short term, the repatriation process needs to be more equitable and better implemented. This can be done by more carefully constructing passenger lists and releasing these in a timely manner. Beyond this, methods — such as reducing quarantine requirements to 14 days — to lessen the cost of tickets and quarantine facilities need to be put in place. Crucially, the Mongolian government needs to implement a concrete plan for opening its borders in the long term, something that they have failed to do so far. Simply put, people have the right to go home. As of now, the Mongolian government has not done enough to ensure such a basic right for its citizens.

If you're able to mostly afford your mortgage payments but find that you're just a little shy each month, you can also look at refinancing instead of pausing your loan payments. If you're able to lower your interest rate substantially with a refinance, it could shrink your mortgage payment to the point where it's affordable, and that way, you won't get stuck in catch-up mode down the line. But you'll need a strong credit score to snag a competitive refinance rate, so if you don't have one, forbearance may be a good option.

Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday urged PM Narendra Modi to bring about clarity on the timeframe for carrying out the Board and Higher Secondary Examinations and also the duration of the academic session 2020-21.In a letter to PM Modi, Patnaik said in the absence of clarity on the academic session and both the Standard-X and Standard-XII Board examinations, all enrolled students and their parents/teachers are in a state of uncertainty. "It is leading to anxiety among all," Patnaik wrote."As all competitive entrance examinations and admission to institutions of higher education are interlinked, national guidelines with tentative timelines will help the states in framing appropriate strategy. It will also help students who are anxious about the examination dates to plan and prepare accordingly. We have been trying to reach out to the maximum number of students digitally through different modes, but it is not possible to cover all students and prepare them to face Boards and different competitive examinations," he said. Patnaik also informed Modi that the state government has decided to keep educational institutions closed till December 31, for the safety of students after due consultation with different stakeholders and experts.Last week, Odisha School and mass education minister Sameer Dash had said metric and higher secondary examinations in the state are likely to be delayed in the current academic session asserting that the exams would not be held without offline classes for at least 3 months."We're bound to conduct exams for the sake of the career of our students. But we will definitely see that the students are not deprived of the teaching facility meant for taking the mandatory exams. Facility of classroom teaching for our students for a minimum of three months has to be ensured before the exams this time," he said.The Central Board of Secondary Education has recently announced holding of practical examination for Std-12 students in January this year, a move that has drawn flak from several people who asked how could the Board hold the exam without schools conducting a single practical class due to Covid-19. The CBSE, which is yet to arrive at a decision on the Std 10 and 12 examination schedules, is likely to do so in a week's time.

His play leaves him ranked as the fifth-leading receiver in the nation and second in the SEC behind Ole Miss’ Elijah Moore, who the Tigers limited to a season-low five receptions for 16 yards and one touchdown back on Oct. 24.
 Along with Smith, there’s also running back Najee Harris and receivers John Metchie III and Slade Bolden, all of whom have had at least six receptions in a single game this fall.
