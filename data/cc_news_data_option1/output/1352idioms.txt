“Really all you need, and it’s especially true in a time like today, you need the game film, the physical exam, which may be difficult to get right now, and the measurables,” he told The Associated Press. “So if a player has been to the combine, that’s all you really need. If a player hasn’t been to the combine or is from a small school, then you’ve just got to go on the game film and you’d be slightly less accurate.ADVERTISEMENT

These are the conditions which children and their parents will be locked into, cheek by jowl with their neighbours. Power outages are not infrequent as the mismanaged electricity provider, Eskom, fails to maintain supply. There will not be much relief from isolation, most houses don't have internet hubs; although most people have cellphones, data access is expensive. This is hardly a rich environment for tutoring children or keeping in touch with family. There will be a strong temptation to escape enclosure particularly in the one- roomed shacks.

“Everybody wants that pass-game contributor,’’ NFL Network draft analyst Ben Fennell said. “There’s less demand for a scheme-specific guy like Henry. College football, in general, is really shying away from those types of players, and so is the NFL.’’
 Fennell’s top three running backs in this draft — D’Andre Swift (Georgia), Jonathan Taylor (Wisconsin), and J.K. Dobbins (Ohio State) — all were prolific college runners. While they weren’t used a lot in the passing game — none of the three had more than 26 catches last season — NFL scouts are reasonably confident that all three are capable of being three-down backs at the next level.

 Other players have had their draft stock pushed up by what they can bring to offenses as receivers.
 “What Clyde Edwards-Helaire did at LSU and Cam Akers did at Florida State, or even some later-round guys that can contribute primarily through the pass game like an Eno Benjamin [Arizona State] in the screen game or a Ke’Shawn Vaughn [Vanderbilt] or a Lamical Perine [Florida], teams value that element now more than ever,’’ Fennell said.

LAYTON — Big, loud, laughing reunions seem out of the question these days, what with social distancing rules and all.
 But virtual reunions?
 On Pitch Performing Arts, which bills itself as Layton’s only live theater, is responding to these new rules of community engagement by offering real-time online reunion specials from past theater productions, as well as virtual concerts over the internet.
 Brandon Stauffer, executive director of On Pitch Performing Arts, said the theater is simply trying to find ways to continue getting art out into the world.
 “When we started OPPA!, it was all about art and how we can keep moving it out to the world,” Stauffer said.
 But then the pandemic broke, and gatherings like live theater became an early casualty. Stauffer admits that social distancing has taken its toll on the theater’s mission.
 “It’s devastating. There were days when I just thought, ‘I’m done. I can’t do this anymore,’” Stauffer recalls. “But then I got to thinking about art, and what it’s lasted through down the ages, and its ability to bring art to the people. And I thought, ‘What can we do?’”
 The answer turned out to be virtual concerts and cast reunions on the theater’s Facebook page. Concerts began Saturday, March 28, with an evening of music from favorite musicals, including “Hello, Dolly!,” “Tuck Everlasting,” “Les Miserables,” “Aida” and much more. OPPA! players also sang songs dedicated to Utah shows that have been postponed or canceled due to the coronavirus.
 OPPA! followed that up Tuesday, March 31, with a reunion show featuring the cast from OPPA’s “Nunsense” production — complete with backstage secrets, favorite moments, clips, still photos and plenty of laughter.
 “Everything is live, and mostly unscripted,” Stauffer said of the online events.
 The live shows are basically a melding of Facebook Live with Zoom teleconferencing software, according to Stauffer. The producers and performers connect via a Zoom meeting, and Stauffer then routes it all through Facebook Live, where the virtual audience members can view it.
 It’s a mildly complicated process, Stauffer admits.
 “On my desk at my house I’ve got two computers, an iPad and a smartphone, all running at the same time,” he said. “It’s another thing I never thought I’d be doing in life — becoming a TV producer. But here we are, desperate times call for desperate measures.”
 Stauffer said that first virtual performance was “one of the most stressful things I’ve done in my career, to be honest.” Although he’s used to solving all sorts of problems on the fly in a live theater setting, the idea of working remotely with others’ computers takes it to a whole new level.
 Still, Stauffer believes that first concert went well, evidenced by the fact the show had been viewed by 9,000 people in the first few days it was up on Facebook — “which is astonishing for us,” he said. Stauffer and his business partner think these sorts of live, local performances are exactly what people are looking for these days.
 “It’s something that’s not Netflix,” Stauffer said. “And this is nothing against Netflix, because I’m watching plenty.”
 In some ways, Stauffer says these virtual performances are even better than live theater in a stage setting. For example, on Facebook they’re able to get instant, specific feedback throughout the event.
 OPPA! also had a “The Wizard of Oz” cast reunion special in the works, and on Thursday, April 9, they’ll present “MisCast Broadway,” featuring various performers throughout Northern Utah singing Broadway tunes from their homes. Stauffer said they have plans for two virtual cast reunions per week, and an online concert every other week.
 Shows can be viewed live, or later on the theater’s Facebook page.

 “On top of everything, how do we survive through this?” Stauffer asked. “This virtual stuff is what it is for us right now. I think we as artists — and theaters — we have a higher ability to help than we think. We’re just trying to do everything we can to keep people excited, and just keep on going.”
 And while Stauffer says the online shows are “stressful, they’re definitely stressful,” it’s also an incredible opportunity.
 “Because we get a chance to do something new,” he said. “And what theaters have done to survive for hundreds and hundreds of years is to do something new.”
 Stauffer believes the arts can help change people’s lives, especially at this unprecedented time in history.
 “Here we are in one of the most unbelievable times we’ve experienced, and the response is to step in and try to make life better for people,” he said. “We just want to keep art going out into the world.”

Jennifer Lopez leads this cringe-worthy show that really only rich people who want everyone to know they have a heart of gold would appreciate. Celebs give $100,000 to someone who touched their lives. Those people must then give half to someone else, so the celebrity can create "a chain of gratitude and kindness." In Lopez's case, she gives the money -- inelegantly, stacks of bills -- to a mom with a girl with cerebral palsy. "You're so cute!" the girl says to Lopez. Unfortunately this back-slapping show has attracted the likes of Kristen Bell, Nick Jonas, Tracy Morgan, Aaron Rodgers, Kevin Hart and Karlie Kloss. Even the title is disingenuous.

 United did take in a fixture behind closed doors before the official lockdown came into force, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side sweeping aside LASK 5-0 in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 showdown.
 It remains to be seen whether their return to action will be made in similar circumstances, or if the 2019-20 campaign will be completed at all.

_Roma, 06 apr 17:17 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Ad oggi sono 37 i casi positivi al Covid-19 a Pomezia, di cui 12 in isolamento domiciliare, 4 ricoverati presso strutture sanitarie, 2 deceduti. Rispetto a ieri si registrano 1 nuovo caso e 5 nuovi guariti. Salgono pertanto a 19 i cittadini guariti. Sono 49 le persone sottoposte a isolamento in via precauzionale (non positivi), di cui 34 in uscita nei prossimi 7 giorni (salvo nuovi aggiornamenti). "Per la prima volta il numero delle persone guarite supera quello dei casi positivi – dichiara il sindaco Adriano Zuccalà –. Un’inversione di tendenza importante che rappresenta un segnale di speranza, ma soprattutto testimonia che, tutti insieme, stiamo facendo un ottimo lavoro di contenimento dell’emergenza. Verranno intensificati i controlli nei prossimi giorni per evitare assembramenti e uscite non giustificate – conclude il Sindaco –. È un sacrificio che dobbiamo fare per il benessere dell’intera comunità, soprattutto per tutelare le categorie più a rischio e per rispetto a tutti coloro che stanno seguendo le regole in maniera puntuale".
