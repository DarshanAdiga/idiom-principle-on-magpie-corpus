A news crew covering a story in Atlanta got carjacked by a pregnant woman who had just crashed her own car, Atlanta police say. A reporter from the CBS 46 crew--who is also pregnant--was inside the news van at the time, Fox 5 reports; she is recovering at home. The suspect crashed into a security gate Tuesday morning before getting in the running news van and driving away. Police who responded to the crash chased the van, which the suspect also crashed. She tried to flee, but was taken into custody. She broke her arm during the incident. (Read more Atlanta stories.)

Phil Mickelson, the player most closely linked with the PGL, is known to have held face-to-face talks with Monahan on this very subject during the Florida swing. What the PGL needs is public buy-in from players or it will ultimately wither on the vine. Monahan admitted he has not met the PGL’s chief executive, Andy Gardiner, which is strange but endorses the sense of a turf war.

A major transformation in healthcare delivery in the State’s public sector hospitals is awaited as e-health is all set to be rolled out at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thiruvananthapuram.
 This is the last leg of the pilot phase of e-health, the Health department’s ambitious ₹96-crore mega project for developing an electronic demographic data base and electronic health records (EHRs) of the population, alongside end-to- end automation of all government hospitals.
 The project was being piloted in 13 institutions from primary health centres to the MCH in Thiruvananthapuram district in a phased manner, since the past one year.
 The implementation of the project at MCH has been a different cup of tea altogether, as being a tertiary care institution, everything from the documentation of clinical details of patients to the level of networking and integration required has been entirely different from the requirements in primary and secondary care settings.
 The project is being taken up in phases at MCH, starting with the processes in the OP block, to be followed by in-patient admissions, billing, discharge and operation theatres scheduling. Integration of all biomedical equipments like auto analysers, CT/MRI/Ultra Sound scanners will be next.
 Once this is completed handwritten OP tickets will be stopped. Next to go on board will be the Casualty services, the Super Speciality Block, and the rest of SAT Hospital.
 Training for all users, including doctors, nurses, para medics, pharmacists, lab technicians, radiographers and reception counter staff will begin in the next two weeks.
 “This project will become successful only when we see it as a better health care story for the patient rather than as just an IT exercise. As doctors involved in designing the software, they must re-imagine their profession in the light of the latest available technology and convey the concept to the developers. For that purpose, we have adopted the Virtual IT cadre (VITC) concept of the State IT Mission,” says C. Jayan, Additional Professor of Surgery and Joint Director, e-Health.
 ##
 Continuous activity
 Software development is an iterative process and the refining or customising of the software to suit the requirements of some 30 medical specialities will be a continuous activity for years.
 “A team of 27 selected doctors and three nurses from various departments were given intensive training at Technopark on basic e-governance principles, business process re-engineering, and the fundamentals of software development. It is this VITC group which is now giving us all the inputs for fine-tuning the software and acting as champions of the project in their respective departments,” he adds.
 The response to the project within the medical fraternity and other MCH staff has been enthusiastic even as they are expected to do much re-learning to work in a different environment. Teething troubles and some confusion should be expected as doctors go through the learning curve.
 But once stabilisation happens, all processes from queuing, admission to discharge will be better organised and doctors will have all information on a patient, including clinical history, lab results and CT/MRI images on their computer screens.
 All wards will have WIFI connectivity with LAN and eventually, doctors and nurses will be moving around with tablets rather than a bunch of case sheets.
 “GoI has mandated SNOMED CT to be the disease classification system and vocabulary for electronic exchange of health information in India. We are one of the first users of SNOMED CT in India,” Dr. Jayan says.

WASHINGTON — Beaten down by the coronavirus outbreak, the world economy in 2020 will suffer its worst year since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the International Monetary Fund says in its latest forecast.
 The IMF said Tuesday that it expects the global economy to shrink 3 percent this year — far worse than its 0.1 percent dip in the Great Recession year of 2009 — before rebounding in 2021 with 5.8 percent growth. It acknowledges, though, that prospects for a rebound next year are clouded by uncertainty.
 The bleak assessment represents a breathtaking downgrade by the IMF. In its previous forecast in January, before COVID-19 emerged as a grave threat to public health and economic growth worldwide, the international lending organization had forecast moderate global growth of 3.3 percent this year. But far-reaching measures to contain the pandemic — lockdowns, business shutdowns, social distancing and travel restrictions — have suddenly brought economic activity to a near-standstill across much of the world.
 “The world has been put in a great lockdown,’’ the IMF’s chief economist, Gita Gopinath, told reporters. “This is a crisis like no other.”
 Gopinath said the cumulative loss to the global gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of economic output, could amount to $9 trillion — more than the economies of Germany and Japan combined.
 The IMF’s twice-yearly World Economic Outlook was prepared for this week’s spring meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. Those meetings, along with a gathering of finance ministers and central bankers of the world’s 20 biggest economies, will be held virtually for the first time in light of the coronavirus outbreak.
 In its latest outlook, the IMF expects economic contractions this year of 5.9 percent in the United States, 7.5 percent in the 19 European countries that share the euro currency, 5.2 percent in Japan and 6.5 percent in the United Kingdom. China, where the pandemic originated, is expected to eke out 1.2 percent growth this year. The world’s second-biggest economy, which had gone into lockdown, has begun to open up well before other countries.
 Worldwide trade will plummet 11 percent this year, the IMF predicts, and then grow 8.4 percent in 2021.
 Last week, the IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, warned that the world was facing “the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.’’ She said that emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia were at especially high risk. And on Monday, the IMF approved $500 million to cancel six months of debt payments for 25 impoverished countries.
 The IMF cautioned that its forecast is shrouded by unknowns. They include the path that the virus will take; the effectiveness of policies meant to contain the outbreak and minimize the economic damage; and uncertainty over whether, even many months from now, people will continue to isolate themselves and depress spending as a precaution against a potential resurgence of the virus.
 On a hopeful note, the IMF noted that policymakers in many countries have engineered what it calls a “swift and sizable’’ response to the economic crisis. In the United States, for instance, the Federal Reserve has intervened aggressively to smooth lending markets. And Congress has enacted three separate rescue measures, including a $2.2 trillion aid package — the largest in history — that is meant to sustain households and businesses until the outbreak recedes and economic life begins to return to normal.
 That package includes direct payments to individuals, business loans, grants to companies that agree not to lay off workers and expanded unemployment benefits. And Congress is moving toward approving a possible fourth economic aid measure.
 Gathering at their own virtual meeting, finance officials of the Group of Seven major industrial countries, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, pledged to “use all available policy tools” to achieve a strong recovery.
 Meghan Clem, CEO of the wedding and party-planning company Intertwined Events, says she is hoping that some government loans come through so she can continue to pay her staff. The next two to three months will likely be the worst of the crisis for Intertwined Events.
 “All events have been canceled or postponed to the fourth quarter, so we are seeing a full stop of revenue for May, June and likely July,” said Clem, whose company is based in Irvine, California.
 In Europe, the sudden downturn has spotlighted the vulnerabilities of the shared euro currency. The 19-country bloc lacks a powerful central treasury. And it’s struggled to settle on a unified fiscal response, with northern European countries like the Netherlands and Germany blocking proposals for shared borrowing backed by all countries. The member countries did agree on what could amount to a half-trillion euros in stimulus. But conditions on part of the package mean that some of the money may never be tapped.
 Italy, which has been deeply hurt by the crisis, is expected to suffer a 9 percent drop this year in its gross domestic product, and its debt load could soar from an already high 135 percent of GDP. Fears have arisen of a renewed debt crisis, though for now stimulus from the European Central Bank has calmed lending markets.
 European governments are deploying plans that subsidize worker pay at companies that have had to put employees on shorter hours or send them home. The idea is that companies keep workers on board so that they can quickly resume without having to recruit and train new staffers later. Their workers’ spending also helps support other businesses. The system represents a sharp contrast to practices in the United States, where applications for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed.
 In Germany, 2.35 million workers are expected to take part in the program. They will receive at least 60 percent of net pay.
 Some countries can’t afford sufficiently aggressive rescue plans, the IMF said, and “may require external support.” Georgieva has said that the IMF is prepared to commit its $1 trillion in lending capacity to support nations that need help in dealing with the pandemic.

Olivier Giroud proved that he is capable of filling in for the injured Karim Benzema as the Arsenal striker scored twice in France's 2-1 friendly defeat of Denmark.
 The Real Madrid star suffered a thigh injury during France's 4-0 win over Armenia on Thursday and Giroud starred in his absence at the Parken Stadium, netting two early goals as Denmark seemingly had their thoughts elsewhere.
 The hosts began the game under a cloud of disappointment after Albania's 3-0 defeat of Armenia earlier in the day forced Denmark to settle for a European Championship play-off place and that appeared to breed lethargy.
 France were two up by the sixth minute, as Giroud netted a quickfire double with the help of unconvincing goalkeeping from Kasper Schmeichel on both occasions.      Denmark scored only eight goals in their qualifying campaign and continued to struggle in the final third, with Nicklas Bendtner a very isolated figure.
 The visitors should have made the score even more comfortable, as Anthony Martial and Giroud spurned fine second-half chances, and although Erik Sviatchenko scored a stunning late goal for the Danes, France always looked set for a fourth successive win.
 The news that Denmark had missed out on an automatic Euro 2016 qualification spot in Group I seemed to impact on the team's mentality and within four minutes they were behind.      The lively Martial cut in from the right and played a clever disguised pass into the area for Giroud and the striker fired beyond Schmeichel, who let the ball squeeze under him.      And the Arsenal forward proved decisive again just two minutes later, meeting Lucas Digne's cross with a volley that Schmeichel parried straight back to him, allowing an easy finish at the second opportunity.      The beleaguered Danes could have fallen three behind with just half an hour played, as France captain Raphael Varane headed Antoine Griezmann's cross agonisingly wide.      Denmark did eventually worry France in the 36th minute, but Varane made an important block at the near post to deny Christian Eriksen after being fed by Michael Krohn-Dehli.
 Morten Olsen opted to replace Jakob Poulsen with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg at the break, though there was little change in Denmark's fortunes, as France continued to look the brighter.
 Martial was the visitors' most potent threat going forwards and went close twice in quick succession, first blazing just over in the 54th minute, before racing down the left and testing Schmeichel at the near post a few moments later.
 Giroud should have completed his hat-trick 24 minutes from time, as he attempted to chip Schmeichel when through on goal and shot straight at the Leicester City goalkeeper.
 Denmark pulled one back in stoppage time, with Sviatchenko smashing an outstanding effort into the top-left corner from 30 yards, but it was too little too late as France cruised to an easy win.

Before you leave on your shopping trip, it's important to wear the proper attire. If you're like me, you've been spending your entire shelter-in-place period sporting pants that feature a drawstring. Naturally, you'll want to dress a bit more formally out in public, unless you're planning to brave the hordes at Walmart - where pajamas are the norm and pants are optional. Also, be sure to wear something you can strip off immediately and disinfect upon your arrival home. Your spouse's bathrobe or a full-body Chewbacca costume should do the trick.

Dear Dave,   I own a small company, and we lease the building we operate from. As an entrepreneur, how do you know when it is time to stop leasing and buy a place of your own?   Peter
 Dear Peter,   You should only buy a building when you have a solid track record of success, and a really good idea of what your building needs will be. A growing business is always a good thing, but you don't want to focus too much on real estate and not enough on generating revenue and managing that growth intelligently. You would also want to make sure you're going to be in anything you buy for a good, long while.
 I'm a big fan of leasing the first few years after starting your own business. It's even better if you can work out of your home, but I understand that's not always practical. Down the road, you can choose to lease with an option to buy, or, in the right situation, just buy a building.
 Remember, make sure you do it all with cash. Don't add debt to the equation!   Dave
 Is it ever too late?   Dear Dave,   Life insurance is one of those things I always said I would get around to buying someday, but, for various reasons, I just haven't done it yet. Is there ever a time when it is too late to get life insurance?   Angie
 Dear Angie,   First of all, I only recommend level term life insurance. It's fairly easy to get until around age 70, depending on your overall health situation. Once you get into your seventies and beyond, however, it can be more difficult to find reasonably priced coverage.
 I recommend that most people have 10 to 12 times their annual income in term life insurance. To be honest, though, you really shouldn't need life insurance if you're 70 or older. At that point, if you've saved and invested wisely over the years, you can be self-insured. By this, I mean you've got enough money in savings and investments to cover funeral expenses - plus enough for a spouse to live on comfortably after you're gone.
 Don't wait any longer, Angie. Take care of this today!   Dave

SAN DIEGO - Four sailors on the San-Diego based aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt are in the hospital with COVID-19, the Navy said Tuesday. One is in intensive care.
 The hospital admissions come the day after a member of the crew died of complications of the virus after four days in the ICU. The Defense Department has not released the name of the sailor.
 The Navy also said Tuesday that 589 of the Roosevelt's crew have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. More than 4,000 of the crew have moved off the ship into housing on Guam, either in private homes or hotels.
 The San Diego-based carrier has a total crew of roughly 4,845 service members, including its embarked air wing and command staff.
 The Roosevelt pulled into Guam on March 26 after several sailors on board tested positive for COVID-19.
 A letter written by the ship's commanding officer, Capt. Brett Crozier, asking the Navy for more assistance for its sailors was leaked and broadly publicized, resulting in Crozier's firing on April 2.
 Days later, then-acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly flew to the western Pacific island and, in a profanity-laced speech over the Roosevelt's public address system, said Crozier was naive and stupid if he believed his letter wouldn't be leaked.
 Modly resigned April 7, a day after audio of that speech also leaked and was broadly publicized.
 The situation on the Roosevelt is indicative of the challenges of containing the virus on Navy ships, where crews work, eat and sleep in extremely close quarters.

Letter: Social distancing to the nth degree - Oroville Mercury-Register


--DocBreak--
What’s obvious about Clarkston High School point guard Tru Allen is how he glides downcourt, dazzles ambidextrously with the basketball in hand and torches defenders scoring-wise from wherever he sees an opening.
 His defense, which Bantams boys’ basketball coach Justin Jones said translates seamlessly to the collegiate level, is apparent too. It’s near-impenetrable. His lateral movements and anticipation typically lock up opposing teams’ top scorers.
 What might fly under the radar is how confident and intelligent he is when it comes to his sport.
 “There were times in the last two years where I’d just let him run our stuff,” Jones said. “I was quiet on the sideline. You could trust him 100 percent with that, and he trusted me. That was built over the years.
 “His basketball IQ is immense. For a point guard to have that level of IQ and athleticism, combined with his overall game, he’ll be fun to watch.”
 Jones trusts he will see more of that starting in 2020-21, when Allen suits up for his new team — the Northwest Nazarene Nighthawks of Nampa.
 Clarkston’s program announced on Twitter on Monday that Allen would sign with the NCAA Division II program.
 The Associated Press’ Washington Class 2A player of the year and Great Northern League MVP in 2019-20 will play under fourth-year coach Paul Rush. The Nighthawks went 15-11 last season but were 20-8 in 2018-19 — they were ranked in D-II’s top 25 and owned a 77-73 win against Idaho, where Tru’s brother and role model, Trevon, recently concluded his All-Big Sky senior season.
 “It’s a really great fit for him, not only with the system NNU runs, but coach Rush is fantastic,” Jones said. “It comes across as a great players’ program. They like to play there. They recruit at a high level and win pretty constantly.”
 Allen, who moved to Clarkston as a freshman after living in Lapwai and Lewiston, visited the Treasure Valley school a week after he scored a game- high 26 points in the Bantams’ runner-up finish to North Kitsap at the state tournament. He had other looks, including from Eastern Washington, Montana State, Denver University and Lewis-Clark State.
 Allen said he felt welcomed by NNU personnel, and appreciated how “forward” Rush was. He was intrigued by the ultra-competitive Great Northwest Athletic Conference, and of course, welcomes the chance at competing for minutes at the point right away — a position the Nighthawks’ offense flows through.
 “There’s a lot of ball screens. The point guard gets a lot of the action,” said Allen, who owns several Bantam records. “Being a point guard, you wanna go somewhere you can run the show for your team. It’s no guarantee, but it’s up for grabs. I have to work for it.”
 Jones expects Allen’s impact at NNU to be significant. He was quick to tab the 6-foot, three-year starter as “certainly one of the best to ever play here,” alongside past stars like Trevon Allen, LCSC’s Jett Sobotta, Whitworth’s Dustin McConnell and Gonzaga’s Josh Heytvelt — the latter of whom had his career scoring mark broken by the younger Allen this year.
 “What stands out first and foremost is his athletic ability; he’s already at the next level,” Jones said of Allen, also a standout receiver and defensive back on the football team at Clarkston. “He’s not one-dimensional. He’ll be asked to do a lot of different things, and I have no doubt he’ll be able to. He just does so much on the floor.”
 Tru Allen finished 2019-20 with per-game averages of 21.4 points, 5.5 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 2.1 steals for the Bantams, who finished 20-6. During his all-state campaign, Allen broke Heytvelt’s all-time scoring record by a few dozen points, finishing with 1,532. He also moved atop the program record books in assists (316) and free throws made (256) — Allen was practically automatic from the free-throw line. In Jones’ decade of coaching at Clarkston, Allen was the only freshman to make varsity. It all added up to 65 wins in Allen’s time at the school.
 “I’ve always been taught to score at all three levels; it messes with defenders,” said Allen, who was a Select Basketball standout in the Boise area during high school. “Just playing fast and being smart with the ball.
 “On the defensive end, it’s all competitiveness. You just have to step it up.”
 Above all, Allen prides himself on his confidence. He says his opponents “might be better, but I’ll never believe it.”
 He showed such trust in himself during his favorite Clarkston basketball moments — a putback buzzer-beater to win the district title against Pullman in 2018-19; a coast-to-coast layin to put away West Valley and take a commanding lead in the GNL midway through last season; and when he spearheaded the underdog Bantams to their state title appearance after his teammates told him they had faith in his ability to do so.
 “He has all the confidence and composure on the floor,” Jones said, “and off it, great humility.”
