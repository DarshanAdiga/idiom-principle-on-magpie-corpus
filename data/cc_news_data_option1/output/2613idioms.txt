The location of Trump’s speech added to his defiant message. Federal officials stopped holding Fourth of July fireworks at Mt. Rushmore 11 years ago out of concern for the fragile environment and the risk of wildfires in the Black Hills.
 In addition to those environmental concerns, public health officials in his own administration have cautioned against mass gatherings like this one, which came roughly two weeks after Trump held a rally in Tulsa, Okla., that raised similar concerns, despite attendance numbers that failed to live up to his campaign’s expectations. The announced crowd of 7,500 at Mt. Rushmore came from around the country, Republican Gov. Kristi Noem said as she introduced Trump.
 Trump seemed most eager to confront the budding movement on the left to reconsider the Mt. Rushmore monument itself, which memorializes presidents Washington, Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Lincoln. Historians have pointed not only to Washington’s and Jefferson’s status as slaveholders, but also to the racist and anti-Semitic past of the monument’s creator, Gutzon Borglum. Several tribal leaders and members also protested Trump’s visit to the monument, which sits on land that they view as sacred and stolen.
 Even among critics of the monument and its creator, there’s little support for the idea of removing the iconic sculpture. But the attention from some scholars and activists gave Trump an opening to cast his opponents as enemies of the country’s most respected presidents.

But what about the opioid epidemic? Lots of Americans die from overdoses!
 Hart blames the drug war for that, too. Yes, opioids are legal, but their sale is tightly restricted.
 “If drugs were over the counter, there would be fewer deaths?” I asked.
 “Of course,” he responds. “People die from opioids because they get tainted opioids ... That would go away if we didn’t have this war on drugs. Imagine if the only subject of any conversation about driving automobiles was fatal car crashes. ... So it is with the opioid epidemic.”
 Drugs do harm many people, but in real life, replies Hart, “I know tons of people who do drugs; they are public officials, captains of industry, and they’re doing well. Drugs, including nicotine and heroin, make people feel better. That’s why they are used.”
 President Eisenhower warned about the military-industrial complex. America’s drug war funds a prison-industrial complex. Hart says his years inside the well-funded research side of that complex showed him that any research not in support of the “tough-on-drugs” ideology is routinely dismissed to “keep outrage stoked” and funds coming in.
 America locks up more than 2 million Americans. That’s a higher percentage of our citizens, disproportionately black citizens, than any other country in the world.
 “In every country with a more permissive drug regime, all outcomes are better,” says Hart. Countries like Switzerland and Portugal, where drugs are decriminalized, “don’t have these problems that we have with drug overdoses.”
 In 2001, Portugal decriminalized all drug use. Instead of punishing drug users, they offer medical help. Deaths from overdoses dropped sharply. In 2017, Portugal had only 4 deaths per million people. The United States had 217 per million.
 “In a society, you will have people who misbehave, says Hart. “But that doesn’t mean you should punish _all_ of us because someone can’t handle this activity.”
 He’s right. It’s time to end the drug war.

  PANAMA CITY -- A suspect has been arrested for the shooting and killing of a man in a Panama City FEMA trailer camp on Monday.


  According to a Thursday Panama City Police Department press release, Jakorey Shivers was charged with second degree murder, felon in possession of a firearm and a felon in possession of ammunition. The charges stem from the shooting death of Swason Owens III, 26, which happened Monday evening at the FEMA camp site on Highway U.S. 98 and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.


  Shivers was apprehended by the United States Marshal Service Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force.


  Arrested with Shivers was 22-year-old Marvita Nicole Hudson. Through the course of the investigation, it was allegedly discovered that Hudson had filed false police reports and provided false information to detectives with a direct intent to protect Shivers and mislead the homicide investigation, the press release states.


  Hudson was charged with accessory after the fact to second degree murder, filing a false police report and possession of crack cocaine.


  This is the second shooting death at a FEMA camp after a 45-year-old woman was murdered in January at the camp on Second Court and Kraft Avenue.


  The Panama City Police Department would like to thank the Bay County Sheriff's Office, Springfield Police Department and the United States Marshal Service for their assistance in this investigation.


  This case is still under investigation and anyone having any information in reference to this case should please contact the Panama City Police Department, 850-872-3100, or you can report your tips anonymously via smartphone by downloading the \"Panama City\" Tip411 app in the Apple App Store or Google Pay Store.

In issuing his order, under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, Ahmed overstepped a ruling from Ford last week that farms can keep COVID-19 positive workers on the job if they are asymptomatic.
 On Thursday, Essex MPP Taras Natyshak called for Ford to reverse that policy. More than 700 healthcare workers have signed an open letter asking for the same.
 Natyshak also said the government must develop plans to ensure migrant workers get sick pay, pandemic pay and adequate accommodation so they can safely isolate when necessary.
 "Doug Ford's plan for migrant workers has now been rejected by hundreds of health experts and by the health authorities on the ground," said Natyshak. "Anyone with COVID-19 should be isolating, not on the job. Ontario desperately needs a plan that ensures workers have paid sick time and a place where they can safely isolate."
 Ford was asked during Thursday's media conference if he would reverse his previous announcement after Ahmed made his move.
 "That's strictly up to the chief medical officer Dr. Ahmed down in the Essex area," he said.
 But later in the conference, he criticized Ahmed.
 "The farmers, the poor gentleman, after saying he could put them back to work, all of a sudden they shut down the farm," said Ford. "I understand where the chief medical officer is, but do you think that encourages other farmers to co-operate when all of a sudden one of their friends gets their farm shut down like that?"
 Ford said he also wanted to deliver a "critical message" to migrant workers that they won't be sent home, after most at the farm who tested positive "hid" when officials came to re-test them.
 "All the workers went and hid," said Ford. "We were able to test three or four out of 190."
 Ford said he thinks the workers are "terrified" they'll be sent home. He said that won't happen and they will be paid, "so there's no reason to hide."
 "Just let the medical professionals do their job and we'll get back and up and running again," he said. "You'll be able to get back to work, the farmers will be able to move forward with their businesses."

The Booneville City Council last week gave a verbal go-ahead for the mayor to engage in a project development agreement to have an analysis into the feasibility of installing a solar array to provide energy for the city.


   


  During a presentation to the council John Coleman of Entegrity Partners said a preliminary "back of a napkin" study of utility bills led his company to a belief the city could save $10,000 to $12,000 annually in energy costs through a project which would require no capital investment.


   


  Coleman termed the estimate conservative.


   


  The city currently pays about $54,000 annually in electricity bills.


   


  Legislation enacted recently allows a company to build a solar array for an entity such as a municipality with no investment provided the entity purchase the energy produced from the company, Coleman said.


   


  The company will have to provide a guarantee of a minimum power amount and a maximum rate for the energy but, Coleman said, the company has been able to beat a stated rate before.


   


  Coleman also said his company is working on a project in Green Forest for both its city and school district.


   


  The Booneville School District is interested in a similar project here superintendent Trent Goff has said, and Coleman previously addressed the school board about the possibilities.


   


  The preliminary estimate for the project discussed last week found the school district's savings should be as much as the city's, if not more, Coleman said.


   


  The benefit to the array covering both city and school facilities would be the larger the array, the lower the energy cost would be, Coleman said.


   


  "I think it's a great idea, and working with the school, I think it's the future and we need to get on board," said Mayor Jerry Wilkins.


   


  Once an agreement is signed -- Coleman said he could, and did, have one to the city by the end of last week, but the next regularly schedule city council meeting isn't until July 27 -- the next step would be to evaluate a property for the project.


   


  Coleman said five to seven acres would be his needed for an array to produce one megawatt of power.


   


  Wilkins posed the use of land the city owns near its water treatment facility.


   


  Water department superintendent Larry Maness said he believed the land in question would be at least five to seven acres.


   


  Wilkins asked the life expectancy of the panels to which Coleman said 30 to 35 years and that the company assumes a 0.5 percent degradation of the panel each year when computing energy generation expectancy.


   


  The project development plan has a fee of $7,000, to $8,000 Coleman told the council but there is no fee if the analysis cannot show at least a $10,000 annual savings.


   


  Additionally, Coleman said, the city writes a check for the fee only in the event the plan shows the city can save $10,000 in annual energy costs, but it decides not to proceed with the project.


   


  If the city chooses to proceed the cost of the study is then folded into the cost for the energy produced, Coleman said.


   


  Once a study is completed the construction and connecting to the electricity grid to provide the energy produced process takes seven to eight months, Coleman said.


   


  Coleman said his company has 70 megawatts in project in operation and construction statewide with 20 in construction and 50 more in a design/development state.


   


  Asked for references by councilman Steve Reid, Coleman said Entegrity completed a project for the Arkansas Department of Corrections and has another in Batesville and that he would be happy to provide contract information.

Initially when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in the country, the Oyo State government did not expedite action on testing and there was no lockdown or restriction of movements until the figures began to soar. Unlike some states where churches, mosques, schools and markets were closed, the state relaxed the restriction till more testing centres were created. With 10 community testing centres created, the number has soared to about 100 testing positive per day. Aggressive testing revealed many numbers infected who were however asymptomatic. Enforcement of social distancing and preventive protocols of use of face masks has also been too low as many people go about at markets, milling around without face masks, believing the pandemic affects majorly the rich who are exposed to exotic lifestyles. Saturday Telegraph's checks in the past two weeks showed that many congregants were not observing the safety protocols. Many go into churches with face masks but pull it down to their chins while singing and praying. No government officials have been seen policing the worship centres to enforce COVID-19 preventive protocols. Chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Oyo State chapter, Dr. Akin Sodipo, who doubles also a member of the Oyo State Task Force on COVID-19, on why many residents do not share the sentiment of the COVID-19 advocates regarding wearing of face masks and washing of hands always, said: “What I can simply say of them is that they are living in utter denial of the fact of reality of the pandemic. “All this is happening because the government is not enforcing the order on the preventive protocols. You need to enforce the regulations for people to comply. Get about 10 persons arrested and prosecute them, and by so doing, others will fall in line.”

Scrase said the health care capacity is still good. "We also monitor Texas and Arizona. We have bumped back up to the 1.2 spread rate, and it may be because of more testing and the results. The state still has one of the lowest positivity rates at 3.48 percent of those tested. Direct sunlight deactivates the virus on surfaces, but winds can carry the droplets up to 18 feet, so it's still up in the air about whether it is better to be outside. Closed spaces with poor ventilation are still bad. Close contact is another easy way to spread the disease. Crowded spaces are also bad because of close range of conversation. So, watch out for the three Cs, closed spaces, close contact and crowded spaces."

President Donald Trump bemoaned protests demanding racial justice as "violent mayhem" Friday, but said little about an alarming resurgence of coronavirus cases as he attended a crowded, fireworks-studded Independence Day celebration beneath majestic Mount Rushmore.


  Trump, under fire for his response to America's spiraling coronavirus caseload four months before the presidential election, spoke on the eve of the July 4th celebrations before thousands of closely-packed people -- many of whom chanted "Four more years;" few of whom were wearing masks.


  In the shadow of four notable predecessors -- George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, whose likenesses are carved into a granite cliff in South Dakota's Black Hills -- the president called on supporters to defend America's "integrity".


  He accused protesters calling for racial justice of "a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children."


  "The violent mayhem we have seen in the streets and cities... is the predictable results of years of extreme indoctrination and bias in education, journalism and other cultural institutions," he added.

SPRINGFIELD -- Illinois, like most states, began a new fiscal year on Wednesday and the person in charge of managing the state's bank accounts said she fears it could be one of the most difficult years in modern memory.
   
 "This is going to be, I think, by far perhaps the most challenging year that I've had to manage as comptroller," state Comptroller Susana Mendoza said in an interview Wednesday. "And that's saying something because, you know, I had to navigate the state through what was, when I took office, the worst fiscal crisis that our state had ever experienced, that two-year budget impasse."
   
 The difference between then and now, she said, was that during the budget impasse, the state still had revenue flowing in, just no legal authority to spend it. But in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the near shutdown of the state's economy that it forced, Illinois now isn't seeing anything close to the revenue it will need to fund the new budget.
   
 "You can pass whatever budget you want," she said. "If the revenues don't come in the way you'd like them to, then there's not enough money to go around for all of the priorities that are represented by that budget. So, at the end of the day, we'll have to see month-to-month what our revenues look like. It's so completely up in the air."
   
 The financial impact of the pandemic started to appear in state revenues in April and May. Before then, Mendoza noted, Illinois was in relatively good shape with a nominally balanced budget in place and revenues coming in greater than expected. The state was even making progress on paying down its backlog of past-due bills.
   
 But that all changed in April after Gov. JB Pritzker extended the tax-filing deadline to July 15, which took a big bite out of revenues the state normally would have seen that month. Meanwhile, the state's unemployment rate shot up to an unprecedented 17.2% in April as employers throughout Illinois were forced to shut down or scale back operations due to the novel coronavirus.
   
 As of Wednesday, according to the comptroller's website, the bill backlog stood at $5.4 billion. But Mendoza said that figure doesn't tell the whole story because in order to keep the state running, it borrowed roughly $2.7 billion.
   
 That included $1.2 billion from the Federal Reserve, just part of the $5 billion in Fed borrowing that state lawmakers authorized during their special session in May. It also included another $1.5 billion in interfund borrowing and borrowing from idle funds in the state treasurer's office.
   
 "So that did help me to pay down some really important bills that needed to be paid of that bill backlog, but it's important to remember that, OK, the bill backlog says it's $5.4 billion, but in actuality, we're still on the hook for paying back that $2.7 billion, so we're really looking at, you know, 5.4 plus 2.7," or $8.1 billion, she said.
   
 Among the high-priority bills the state paid, she said, were invoices from Medicaid providers, including hospitals, which were already reeling from revenue losses that resulted when they were forced to call off nonemergency surgeries and procedures in order to free up resources for COVID-19 patients.
   
 The $1.2 billion in federal borrowing came through a program called the Municipal Liquidity Facility, which the Federal Reserve Board authorized in March to help states and large municipalities deal with the dramatic falloff in revenue they were seeing. Illinois is paying 3.8% interest on the loan, which is due to be paid back by June 30, 2021.
   
 However, the plan for paying back that money, and any more the state may need to borrow this fiscal year, hinges on the idea that Congress will pass another economic relief package that will include significant relief for states -- something it has not done yet and is still the subject of partisan wrangling on Capitol Hill.
   
 Mendoza said there is no way for Illinois to make it through this new fiscal year without making draconian budget cuts if Congress doesn't come through with that aid.
   
 "Because Illinois is not the only one who's looking at this type of financial disaster situation, but every single state in the country is going to require federal government sending financial aid," Mendoza said. "And when I say financial aid, I don't mean loans. I mean specifically grants -- money that does not have a million strings attached to it that would go specifically to help make up for lost revenues due to COVID-19."
   
 Republicans in Congress, however, have been reluctant to accept what they see as a "bailout" of state governments, many of which, including Illinois, had significant financial challenges before the pandemic.
   
 In April, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, suggested that some states would be better off filing for bankruptcy. Amid significant backlash, McConnell walked that idea back a few days later and suggested a direct aid package -- but only if it included civil immunity from COVID-19-related lawsuits for employers, which Democrats have not been willing to accept.
   
 Mendoza called the idea that Illinois and other states were asking for bailouts "laughable," while noting that Illinois receives less in federal benefits from Washington than it pays into it. McConnell's home state of Kentucky, meanwhile, receives more than $2 in benefits for every dollar it sends to Washington.
   
 "Mitch McConnell must forget that it's states like Illinois and Connecticut and California and New York that bail out his state of Kentucky every single year," Mendoza said. "He's used to living off of the state of Illinois and the state of California and the state of New York and the state of Connecticut and every other donor state, which by the way, most of which happened to be blue states."
   
 Mendoza said that when it comes to paying bills on a month-to-month basis, her office will prioritize making scheduled debt payments, paying out retirement benefits and making payments to public schools. Beyond that, she said, everything else in state government will be at risk without federal aid.
   
 "We are far from done with this pandemic, so if anybody believes that we're even remotely out of the woods yet, they're imagining things," she said. "We really have yet to see what the month-to-month reduction in revenues is going to be. We can try to predict them, but this is uncharted territory."

U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler has revealed the size of forgivable federal loans received by her family's businesses just days before the Small Business Administration is set to release that data, the Kansas City Star reported.
   
 In a statement to the Star, Hartzler said Hartzler Farms received $26,900 from the Paycheck Protection Program and Heartland Tractor obtained a loan of $451,200. The loans helped the farm retain three employees and supported 54 jobs at Heartland Tractor.
   
 Hartzler's office did not respond Friday morning to a request for comment.
   
 The Tribune first reported in April that Hartzler's family businesses received loans under the program created to provide relief during the economic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Her office has repeatedly declined to reveal the amounts of the loans in response to Tribune inquiries and could not be reached Friday for comment on the Star's report.
   
 The Paycheck Protection Program was created in the relief bill approved March 27 and has given $349 billion for loans to businesses that kept employees on the payroll. The money may also be spent on expenses such as rent, mortgages and utilities, and, if spent within eight weeks of receipt, does not have to be repaid.
   
 Congress has since added additional funding and, before going on recess for the Independence Day holiday, voted to extend the deadline for applications under the program until Aug. 8. It had been set to expire Tuesday.
   
 Hartzler's disclosure of her family businesses' loans comes just days before the U.S. Treasury will release data on all loans of $150,000 and above. The treasury will release the names and other details about loan recipients and report the amount of each loan in ranges.
   
 In the listing, the loan for Heartland Tractor would be reported in the $350,000 to $1 million range but the loan to Hartzler Farms would not be disclosed. For loans below $150,000, the Treasury will report aggregate totals by zip code, industry and other data.
   
 "This program has helped employees keep food on the table, pay their rent, and meet their car payments," Hartzler said in the statement to the Star. "The program protects paychecks across the state, including employees at the small business owned by my husband and me."
   
 According to Congressional disclosure reports, Hartzler, jointly with her husband, owns a farm and farmland leased to others in Cass County. She and her husband own Heartland Tractor, a dealership with locations in Harrisonville, Lamar, Nevada and Iola, Kansas.
   
 The combined value of the holdings is in the range of $4.45 million to $15.3 million and the businesses produced income between $217,000 and $1.3 million in 2018, the last year for which figures are available. Members of Congress give ranges for the value of and income produced by their assets.
   
 In a statement to the Tribune on Monday, Danny Jativa, spokesman for Hartzler, said she did not know when she applied for the loan that the Trump administration had waived ethics reviews of PPP loans involving members of Congress and administration officials.
   
 The rule, issued April 13 waived requirements for those loans to be approved by a SBA body called the Standards of Conduct Committee, which reviews small business funds for companies in which members of Congress and federal employees or family members in their household have an ownership interest of 10 percent or more.
   
 Lindsey Simmons, the Hallsville Democrat challenging Hartzler in Missouri's 4th Congressional District, has repeatedly called on Hartzler to reveal the size of the loans her family businesses received.
   
 "Vicky Hartzler had no intent on disclosing the amount of taxpayer funds she received until the SBA announced they would disclose the recipients," Simmons said in a statement sent by email. "She got caught and decided to come clean."
   
 She noted that Hartzler has said her farm business did not apply for another federal program that requires it to show a loss of at least 5 percent to qualify.
   
 "If her farm did not experience that loss, one wonders why she needed taxpayer money to keep employees paid," Simmons said. "Further, it remains unclear whether Representative Hartzler's family members, including her husband, were counted among the employees receiving the aid."
   
 She told the Star that she thought it was interesting that the amount the Heartland Tractor Company received was nearly four times larger than the average PPP loan. Hartzler has a history of taking advantage of government programs, the Star reported.
   
 "I definitely believe that our campaign pushing for accountability and people in the district pushing for accountability got the ball rolling for her to disclose how much taxpayer money she's taken," she said.
   
 In a statement issued Friday morning, Simmons criticized Hartzler for having family businesses that obtained the loans while voting against other legislation providing economic relief during the pandemic.
   
 "Vicky Hartzler jumped to the front of the line -- ahead of rural businesses, ahead of family farmers, ahead of woman-owned businesses, ahead of minority communities -- because she is wealthy and well-connected," Simmons said. "There's a great hypocrisy in a woman who took taxpayer money for herself while denying it to others -- voting against hazard pay, protecting large meat processing facilities at the expense of local producers, denying the expansion of healthcare coverage -- because she believes folks should have saved for a rainy day, even though her own business did not."

Non solo la ormai possibile adesione di due dei paesi della regione apre la strada ad altri paesi, ma le condizioni che l'UE ha stabilito per l'adesione stessa, influenzeranno notevolmente le relazioni tra i paesi dei Balcani occidentali. La Commissione europea ha chiarito che i potenziali “Stati Membri” devono avere "buone relazioni di vicinato" perché "l'UE non può e non importerà controversie bilaterali e l'instabilità che possono comportare". Ciò significa che gli stati che vogliono aderire all’unione dovranno prima aver risolto le loro controversie bilaterali. Come noto a tutti nei Balcani occidentali la maggior parte delle controversie sono causate da disaccordi sui confini, uno “strascico storico” della disgregazione dell'ex Jugoslavia, fase in cui le demarcazioni dei confini stessi non sono sempre state definite con precisione. Trovare una soluzione rappresenterà una grande sfida per i paesi dei Balcani occidentali e l'UE.

Meanwhile, Obaseki and Shaibu have fired salvo at the APC leaders for “undemocratic character” exhibited during the crisis that led to their defecting to the PDP. Speaking during a visit to Engineer Gideon Ikhine’s camp office, Obaseki described APC as a lawless political party that has no regards’ for constituted authority. “I’m very happy to stand here today and watch my brother Engineer Gideon Ikhine speak. Today you would agree with me that history is being made not only in Edo State, but in the entire country Nigeria. Democracy has taken a new direction. “I was in a system before where old politicians see themselves as lords, where things are done with recourse to law. A political party that is lawless, party without idealogy, a party where people do things with impunity where integrity does not anything to them, a party where there is no justices and fairness, so I left APC because I do not like their impunity.” Also, Shuaibu said that Edo people are ready to swim the big ocean with Obaseki for continuation of the delivery of the dividends of democracy which he promised them in 2016. He however noted that the decision to dump APC was not an easy one, but said that it was necessary to follow his principal because of the love and wonderful work that the State Governor is doing in the state. “I want to tell the peace loving people of Edo State that we are always there for them, we appreciate the support they have given to us since we came on board in 2016. We are together in this battle to free Edo State from the hands of bad people. “As the election draws near, I urged everybody to be calm and our great party the PDP so that we can both achieve our aims. I’m happy that Edo state is now a PDP state why APC is now the opposition party.

Tesla cars enjoy a massive following around the world - in countries where these electric vehicles are sold as well as where the company has no product presence. While often raved for being cheaper to commute in in the long run and for its performance capabilities, these EVs are also the objects of envy more often than not and buyers also often tend to go for it for the eyeballs it tends to grab. While not an uncommon sight on many US and European roads, Tesla cars could become even more common as the company is reportedly looking at fleet vehicles to further expand business.
 According to a report in Electrek, Model 3 is fast emerging as a favourite vehicle for transportation needs of employees in the corporate world. Concerns regarding range of EVs have been subsiding consistently due to advances made in battery as well as charging technologies which is helping the push towards fleet electric mobility.
 (Opinion piece: Tesla's overexcited fans should cool down a little)
 Tesla has been working to convince fleet operators to go all electric and there are signs that it may finally be working considering that the five-year cost of ownership for a Model 3 works out to be possible as much - if not less - than the cost for owning a vehicle running on conventional fuel systems.
 While Tesla has a range of products in its garage, the Model 3 has truly helped the company reach the masses. It is the most affordable Tesla in the world and helped the company become a household name. As such, pushing Model 3 to fleet operations makes sense as the car could make it easier to convince fleet operators about the cost benefits. What it would do to the image of the car in the mind of prospective buyers, however, isn't known with certainty but considering the cult status of sorts that Tesla enjoys, analysts predict it would hardly impact sentiments of the individual buyer.
 Tesla delivered 90,650 vehicles during the last quarter which was significantly higher than previous estimates. Its soaring share prices climbed a little more after this announcement. Clearly, the California-based company is riding a strong wave and entering fleet operations could adds another sail to its wings.
