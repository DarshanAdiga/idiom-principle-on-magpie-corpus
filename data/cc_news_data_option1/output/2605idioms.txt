A multi-hour plane ride to a tropical locale is not necessary before strapping on your snorkel this summer. Fathom Five National Marine Park in Tobermory has some of the best freshwater diving in the country (Tobermory is often referred to as the scuba diving capital of Canada), with crystal-clear waters, submerged cliffs and caves and over 20 historic shipwrecks. Divers Den is a dive shop in the area that can outfit you with equipment and take you out on a boat to showcase the best sites. Right now, they’re only offering morning charters, which are for experienced divers travelling with their own equipment. Snorkellers can still rent a mask and wetsuit, and one of their two-hour snorkelling trips costs $80 per adult (you can also charter a boat for a private tour starting at $600 for a half day). They’re currently operating at limited capacity, and social distancing and masks are required when you’re in the shop.

Ghent’s traffic circulation plan is based on much earlier ones introduced in Dutch cities during the 1970s and 1980s.

Private motor traffic could only go from one quadrant to the other via a ring road, and a system of one-way streets was installed literally overnight. Two- thirds of all journeys in Groningen are now done by bicycle, and no business owners would want cars to dominate the city again.

“The kids came out and played great defense, saw the ball and hit the ball,” Humphreys said.
 Alyson Ambler executed the deciding blow in the final two games with home runs.
 The title game ended dramatically, Humphreys recalled. Marysville Pilchuck had runners at second and third with one out in the seventh inning.
 “Their coach called for a squeeze bunt and (the batter) laid it down perfectly,” Humphreys said. “But Alyson charged in, fielded the ball with her glove hand, and got it to (catcher) Kenzie Hill to record the out at home.”
 After a four-pitch walk that loaded the bases, Ambler recorded a swinging strike out to end the game.
 “I remember thinking, ‘I am getting too old for this’ midway through that final game,” Humphreys said. “It was an incredible feeling. The place was packed with Blue Devil fans.
 “It was an honor to be a part of the group,” Humphreys said. “I was humbled to be there.”
 “It was certainly a stressful weekend with an amazing result,” McHie said. “We were all on edge.
 “Having two dominant pitchers like Hope Klicker and Alyson Ambler certainly gave us an edge,” McHie said, “and it showed when the tournament was over.”

 “They supported each other well and set the stage for Blue Devil softball players going forward,” Humphreys said. “It was the culmination of the kids stepping up the bar and putting their stamp on it.”

Much of this online support has been directed toward Black-owned small businesses such as Sky Island Farm. The family documents life on the farm through its Instagram page, capturing small moments like a ladybug next to the curling tendril of a pea plant, or the first swallowtail butterfly of the season landing on Thorn’s arm.
 Harwell mostly runs the farm’s Instagram account. She recently read “Farming While Black” by Leah Penniman, part commentary on the history of Black farmers and part guide to agricultural techniques from African diasporic farmers.
 Harwell, who is white, realized the farm’s Instagram could be doing more to help its cause.
 “There’s an opportunity to really uplift Bil and have his voice be heard as a Black farmer,” she said.
 Thorn owns the land Sky Island is on; just 0.4% of American farmland is Black- owned, according to a report from the Center for American Progress. Harwell has made him a regular sight in their feed, usually smiling next to greens.
 Commenters started asking how they could donate, and Thorn started including links to the farm’s Venmo and PayPal accounts on their posts. People started sharing their posts, and the family knew the attention was significant when their followers and likes began increasing by the thousands.
 An old picture posted in January of Thorn standing in a field peppered with white and yellow daisies has 40 likes. One from June 7 of him showing off produce to the camera has 2,649, including D’Arcy Carden, star of NBC’s hit sitcom “The Good Place.” It’s just a chunk of their following, which has surpassed 8,200 accounts and is growing daily.
 The attention came at a time when the farm was already seeing an uptick in business. While the coronavirus pandemic ended orders from restaurants and halted discussions about supplying produce to Seattle schools, the farm’s Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program was the perfect setup for socially distanced clients.
 At last season’s peak, the farm was delivering just under 70 baskets of produce to members who signed up online. This year, they had to cap registration at 150 members.
 The rise in orders means Thorn had to shorten the delivery season from last year’s 24 weeks to 16 weeks to meet demand. With all the new customers, the farm’s four greenhouses and cleared land can’t generate enough produce to go 24 weeks.
 The original fundraising goal was geared toward funding the tractor, a certified wash station to prewash greens for consumption by customers, and a commercial kitchen for school field trips and cooking demonstrations. Money raised through the GoFundMe will go toward improving the commercial kitchen and building additional structures on the farm, like lodging and outdoor seating.
 While Thorn is grateful for the support the farm has received, his feelings are mixed.
 He said the current moment seems like a promising move away from the politics and rhetoric of President Donald Trump’s administration, which he described as “basically fascism.” But while the protests have been a glimmer of hope, he’s scared of pushback, like the kind he’s seen among some Grays Harbor residents.
 Ignorance abounds in local Facebook groups and social media posts. Thorn, a native of Sonoma County, California, who saw two Black valedictorians in high school, said the adjustment to being a Black business owner in rural white America has been challenging.
 Change is complicated, Thorn said. Donations like the ones the farm is receiving are good, but it can be disheartening that the support comes after Floyd’s killing.
 “Our produce is still the same as it was last year,” he said. “I find it disappointing that it takes catastrophe to get people to appreciate local food. I don’t want to be overly critical of my fellow man, but at the same time, I don’t know.”
 Harwell said she hopes people continue their support beyond the current moment.
 “It took a Black man dying for people to be like, ‘Oh, you should help the Black community, ’ ” she said. “I hope people don’t forget. Maybe they’ll support a Black-owned business now, but what will they be doing next year?”
 Next year, another season will come to Sky Island. Thorn wants to work with plants until the day he dies.
 He’s always gardened, coming from a plant-loving family with a mother and grandfather who grew their own food. His dad grew flower gardens — big ones that Thorn helped to tend during the summers spent at his dad’s house after his parents split up.
 It’s the peace of working with plants that he loves, the quiet that comes with watching something bloom and assisting it along the way.
 Thorn plans to be working on the farm for years to come, surrounded by the huge trees of his patch of rainforest stretching into the sky, helping things grow.

Eastwood excels in the key role of Staff Sergeant Clint Romesha. (As the son of Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood, the young star of _The Longest Ride_ and _The Fate of the Furious_ must have seen the irony of playing  a soldier named Clint.) Romesha understands that thoughts of home and family might interfere with the laser focus required to have the backs of his brothers in arms. Having written his own account of the war in the book _Red Platoon,_ Romesha won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his courage under fire. Eastwood captures the soldier's "saddle up" spirit and also his keen grasp of what led to this unwinnable situation.

So it looks like next-gen games will in fact be increasing price as the first pricing details for NBA 2K21 were released. The staggering $70 price tag for the standard edition was revealed yesterday and according to a games industry research firm, more publishers could follow suit as next-gen games require more money and time to develop.
 “ _IDG works with all major game publishers, and our channel checks indicate that other publishers are also exploring moving their next-gen pricing up on certain franchises. Not every game should garner the $69.99 price point on next-gen, but flagship AAAs such as NBA 2K merit this pricing more than others._ ”
 Though interestingly, some big AAA titles haven’t exactly done so just yet, with Cyberpunk 2077 and Assassins Creed: Valhalla being two of the most anticipated games of 2020 and still priced at $60. Though, granted both titles are releasing on current gen platforms before next-gen, but they will offer a free upgrade to next-gen console versions.
 According to the firm’s research, the last time games prices increased due to a new console generation was in 2005 with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 generation increasing prices from $50 to the now-standard $60. Even with the new $70 price tag that’s only a 17% increase since that generational shift in 2005, whilst development costs for games have increased by 200% to 300%.

Since this is the Thunder Moon, a quick note on lightning safety. Most of the lightning that strikes the ground arcs from the negatively charged bottom of the storm to the ground underneath the storm. Much rarer is positive lightning, which arcs from the top of a thunderstorm to strike the ground up to eight miles away. Positive lightning can sometimes strike areas where the sky is clear (hence the term "bolt out of the blue"). Because it arcs across a greater distance it tends to be 5 to 10 times more powerful than regular ground strikes. Because it can strike dry areas outside of the storm, positive lightning tends to start more fires than negative lightning. Although positive lightning is rare (less than 5% of all lightning strikes), the lack of warning combined with its greater power tends to make it more lethal.

You could also watch this intensely powerful movie, which Lurie directs with a keen understanding of the mechanics of battle and an overriding humanism that puts flesh-and-blood on the bones of the tragic story being told about Bravo Troop 3-61 CAV, one of the most decorated units of the 19-year conflict. Eastwood excels in the key role of Staff Sergeant Clint Romesha. (As the son of Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood, the young star of The Longest Ride and The Fate of the Furious must have seen the irony of playing a soldier named Clint.) Romesha understands that thoughts of home and family might interfere with the laser focus required to have the backs of his brothers in arms. Having written his own account of the war in the book Red Platoon, Romesha won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his courage under fire. Eastwood captures the soldier’s "saddle up" spirit and also his keen grasp of what led to this unwinnable situation.

The Fennec (or Vector, if you like) was added at the beginning of Season 4, and it's essentially an MP7 pushed to the extreme. Its claim to fame is that it has the fastest fire rate of any gun in Warzone - but to counteract this, it has a low mag size, high recoil and side-to-side bounce; and its bullet velocity and damage dropoff stats make it an extremely close quarters weapon only.

In the weeks after Ruhl's death, the Forest Service organized crisis intervention sessions for his coworkers, common procedure after a fire fatality. The sessions, officially called Critical Incident Stress Management, or CISM, involve a visit from a team of peer supporters—fellow firefighters who understand the job's unique culture and challenges and are trained in discussing trauma—and at least one licensed clinician. Over a few days, the team describes common responses to a traumatic event and teaches general coping methods, referring firefighters for more care if necessary. Done well, the sessions are effective in helping most survivors. But trauma affects different people differently, and symptoms may not appear for weeks, months or years.

"Je krijgt nu een maximum hoeveelheid eiwit voor alle diergroepen", legt Ad Baltus van Boeren in Actie Noord-Holland uit. "De jonge kalfjes en de hoogdrachtige koeien kunnen niet zonder extra eiwit. Dan krijg je gezondheidsproblemen. Dat noem ik gewoon dierenmishandeling als je opzettelijk beesten ondervoedt."

 De frustratie zit hoog bij de boeren. Ze hebben namelijk een alternatief plan bedacht om de stikstofuitstoot te verminderen. Zij willen de eiwitten in het veevoer verlagen op basis van vrijwilligheid. "We kunnen echt wel reduceren maar je moet het niet per ondernemer aanpakken, maar in het algemeen. Als de ene boer wat meer uitstoot en de andere wat minder dan boek je ook resultaat."

Electric stun weapons fire pairs of dart-like probes trailing wires to make an electrical circuit. TASER darts are barbed to ensure they remain embedded in clothing and do not pull free when the target falls over, but the barbs can get stuck in clothing and fail to penetrate far enough to make a good connection. JIFCO’s partners have developed new barbs inspired by porcupine quills, which are covered in scales so they penetrate easily but are difficult to dislodge.

“At the beginning of the season, Jerry had a game plan that all of our players bought into immediately,” former assistant and current head coach Arch McHie said. “Play tough, play with passion, and have fun.”
 Wa-Hi was dominant in the regular season. Its only league loss came at Murr Sports Park against rival Richland.
 “It was a wake-up call,” Humphreys said. “It proved we were not infallible.”
 The Blue Devils won the district championship and opposed the Bombers for the regional tournament title.
 “During our first practice after district, our No. 5 hitter — Traeann Payne — broke her ankle and assistant coach Kate Keyes was struck by a foul fly from the baseball diamond,” Humphreys said. “The regional was not going to be easy because we had some adversity to take care of.”
 Wa-Hi trailed 4-1 in the fourth inning of the regional final when sophomore Ellie Rossbach, a junior varsity performer during the regular-season, belted a two-RBI, pinch-hit home run to pull the Blue Devils within a single tally.
 A four-run, seventh-inning rally put Wa-Hi over the top.
 “It seemed like the right thing to do,” Humphreys said. “What seemed scary was turned around by one of the last players you’d expect to make an impact. It was awesome.”
 The word awesome applied to the Blue Devils’ showing at state in Spokane. Wa- Hi blanked Thomas Jefferson (10-0), Eastlake (5-0), Skyview (1-0) and Marysville Pilchuck (1-0).
