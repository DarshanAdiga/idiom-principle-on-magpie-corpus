One of the big overlooked risk factors for Covid-19 spread is time. The longer you spend with an infected person, the more likely the virus is to be transmitted. The rule of thumb is 15 minutes: The CDC considers risky “close contact” to be spending 15 minutes or more with an infected person. But this rule of thumb is just that. “That doesn’t mean if you spend 14 minutes your risk is zero,” Muge Cevik, a physician and virology expert at the University of St. Andrews, said earlier this year.

The Center Square) – While hundreds of thousands of mail-in votes could still be counted in the days ahead, it appears the most expensive question on the ballot is headed to defeat.
 For statehouse races, Isaac Wink, an analyst with Reform For Illinois, noted a large disparity in spending by the Democratic majority getting $17.6 million in this election while minority Republicans only got around $4 million.
 “[Illinois House Speaker] Mike Madigan, to his personal campaign committee, he’s gotten $17.6 million since the last election,” Wink said. “For comparison, House Minority Leader Jim Durkin, a Republican, has gotten a little over $4 million, so that really goes to show the difference in what they’re able to do to support their caucuses.”
 For the proposed constitutional amendment, Wink said the governor spent big money on the proposed income tax change voters seem to have rejected. Opponents also spent big money.
 “You’ve got Gov. Pritzker putting $58 million into the pro side and you’ve got Kenneth Griffin giving about $54 million on the anti side,” Wink said. “So, that’s over $110 million just on that ballot question alone, which is the most expensive ballot initiative that we’ve seen in Illinois history.”
 The Vote Yes For Fairness group said Wednesday morning said it was disappointed with the outcome.
 “Now lawmakers must address a multi-billion dollar budget gap without the ability to ask the wealthy to pay their fair share. Fair Tax opponents must answer for whatever comes next,” the group said in a statement.
 There could still be hundreds of thousands of vote-by-mail ballots being processed over the next two weeks from the more than 2.3 million sent out, but it definitely set a record in the era of COVID-19.
 Illinois State Board of Elections spokesman Matt Dietrich said voters need to be patient with the unofficial results with potentially 300,000 mail-in ballots that have yet to be counted.
 “It’s always been that way in Illinois, but this year more than usual so don’t be surprised if you see large leads, either may be a race tightens, or maybe a lead is increased or maybe the lead changes between two candidates in a close race, especially in some of our legislative races, and some of our county races,” Dietrich said.
 Dietrich said they heard a lot of reports from county clerks that voters were turning in their mail ballots and voting in person, and things will become more clear over the next few days of how many are still outstanding. It’s also unclear if there will be any recounts anywhere. The process of challenging an election outcome isn’t automatic. Dietrich said it requires a lawsuit.
 “It is a very elaborate legal proceeding and it’s very, very expensive,” Dietrich said.
 The final vote won’t be certified by the state until Dec. 4.

ATLANTA - About 60,000 ballots remained to be counted in Georgia Thursday morning, two days after voters went to the polls, an official with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office said.   That’s down from about 200,000 ballots that were still uncounted the day before.   “Fast is great, and we appreciate fast,” Gabriel Sterling, the voting system manager for the secretary of state’s office, told reporters during a news conference at the Georgia Capitol. “We more appreciate accuracy.”   Since the votes now being counted are mail-in ballots, President Donald Trump’s once healthy lead over Democratic challenger Joe Biden in Georgia is continuing to shrink. With the Republican president urging his supporters to vote in-person during the weeks leading up to Election Day, most of the absentee ballots are coming from Democrats.   As the Trump-Biden contest in Georgia continues to tighten, Republican U.S. Sen. David Perdue’s lead over Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff also keeps shrinking. Perdue’s share of the vote was down to 50.03% on Thursday morning, barely the 50%-plus-one margin needed to avoid a January runoff.   Sterling said the time it’s taking to count Georgia’s absentee ballots is due in part to the state’s elections system, which relies on county elections offices.   “Some are more resourced than others,” he said.   Sterling also noted that Georgia is using paper ballots for the first time in 20 years. Like other states, Georgia elections offices also are grappling with an unprecedented volume of mail-in ballots from voters who were wary of waiting in long Election Day lines during the midst of a global pandemic.   Chatham County accounts for 17,157 of the ballots remaining to be counted, followed by Fulton County with 11,200 still out. Clayton County is next with 7,408 uncounted ballots, followed by Gwinnett County with about 7,300 still out.   With the margins in Georgia so close, Sterling said provisional ballots and absentee ballots sent in by military personnel from overseas could factor into the results.   “We’re going to make sure every lawful ballot is counted,” he said.   As of Thursday morning, Trump held a razor-thin lead over Biden in Georgia, 49.57% to 49.20%. With results in just a handful of states still uncertain, capturing Georgia’s 16 electoral votes would go a long way toward putting either candidate over the top.   Perdue was still leading Ossoff by more than two points – 50.03% to 47.66%. But due to Georgia’s runoff requirements, Perdue can’t afford much more slippage if he wants to win a second Senate term outright.   “If overtime is required when all of the votes have been counted, we’re ready, and we will win,” the Perdue campaign said Thursday. “It is clear that more Georgians believe that David Perdue’s positive vision for the future direction of our country is better than [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer’s radical socialist agenda.”   Ossoff predicted there will be runoff to decide the contest.   “When a runoff is called and held in January, Georgians are going to send Jon to the Senate to defend their health care and put the interests of working families and small businesses ahead of corporate lobbyists,” said Ellen Foster, Ossoff’s campaign manager. “Georgians are sick and tired of the endless failure, incompetence and corruption of Senator Perdue and Donald Trump.”  
 Sterling said he hopes ballot counting in Georgia will be completed by the end of Thursday.

Più esattamente - si legge in una nota - lo spirito del nazionalismo e del fascismo per parlare della giornata delle Forze armate. Il documento, oltre a essere inviato alle scuole per studenti e docenti, è stato pubblicato anche sul sito Usr Marche e lascia senza parole. La ministra dell'Istruzione, Lucia Azzolina, intervenga tempestivamente. Il contenuto di quella comunicazione è inaccettabile". Brignone ricorda che "l'operato di Filisetti è stato in passato più volte oggetto di interrogazioni parlamentari.

MOSCOW (AP) — Russian bailiffs have raided the offices of opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s organization while the politician is still recovering in Germany from a nearly fatal poisoning. Navalny’s associates linked the move to a court ruling that obliged Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation to pay damages to a school catering company reportedly linked to a tycoon with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Navalny is Putin’s most visible opponent. He fell ill on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and was flown to Germany two days later. Tests conducted at labs designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that the poison used on Navalny was a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.

Is MSA Safety an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and MSA Safety is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and MSA Safety is halfway there. MSA Safety looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.

ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has given the Vatican secretariat of state three months to transfer all of its financial holdings to another Vatican office following its bungled management of hundreds of millions of euros in donations and investments that are now the subject of a corruption investigation.Francis summoned the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, his deputy as well as the Vatican’s top finance officials for a meeting Wednesday and gave them a three-month deadline to complete the transfer, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.The Vatican released the letter that Francis wrote to Parolin on Aug. 25 in which he announced he was stripping the secretariat of state of its ability to independently manage the money.Francis cited the “reputational risks” incurred by the department’s previous investments in speculative operations that have cost the Holy See tens of millions of euros, some of it money from the Peter’s Pence donations from the faithful.Francis' decision was an embarrassing blow to the secretariat of state’s standing as the most powerful Holy See office, reducing it to essentially any other department that must propose a budget and have it approved and monitored by others.Its financial holdings are now to be held by the Vatican’s treasury office, known as APSA and incorporated into the Holy See’s consolidated budget, Francis wrote. The economy ministry will oversee spending.The outcome is essentially that which was sought years ago by Cardinal George Pell, Francis' first economy minister who clashed with the secretariat of state over his financial reforms and efforts to wrest control of the department’s off-the-books funds. He famously boasted in 2014 that he had “discovered” hundreds of millions of euros that were “tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet” — a reference to the secretariat of state’s in-house asset portfolio.Pell had to abandon those reform efforts in 2017 to face trial for sexual abuse in his native Australia, but he was acquitted and returned triumphantly last month to Rome, where he was granted a well-publicized audience with Francis.Francis moved against his own secretariat of state amid a year-long investigation by Vatican prosecutors into the office’s 350-million-euro investment into a London real estate venture.Prosecutors have accused several officials in the department of abusing their authority for their involvement in the deal, as well several Italian middlemen of allegedly fleecing the Vatican of tens of millions of euros in fees.The scandal has exposed the incompetence of the Vatican’s monsignors in managing money, since they signed away voting shares in the deal and agreed to pay exorbitant fees needlessly to Italians who were known in business circles for their shady dealings.In his letter to Parolin, Francis cited the London venture as well as the secretariat of state’s investment in a Malta-based investment vehicle, Centurion Global Fund, headed by the Vatican’s longtime external money manager.According to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Centurion invested in such ventures as the “Rocketman” film on Elton John as well as a holding company headed by Lapo Elkann, one of the more flamboyant members of Italy’s Agnelli clan.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

KINGSPORT — Kingsport no longer has a nine-mile walking and biking trail that stretches from one end of town to the other.
 It now has a 10-mile walking and biking trail that stretches from one end of town to the other.
 Kingsport cut the ribbon on and officially opened the newest section of the Greenbelt Wednesday afternoon. The new segment is located on the eastern end of the trail, from roughly the 0.4 mile marker near Orebank Road to the pedestrian path on Cleek Road.
 The one-mile extension is a 10-foot-wide asphalt path that includes a 325-foot timber frame pedestrian bridge similar to the one on the western end of the Greenbelt.
 “This section not only provides a new place for people to exercise. It’s also an opportunity to celebrate an important achievement for the Greenbelt,” said Kitty Frazier, manager of the Parks and Recreation Department. “This new mile segment is the completion of the original Greenbelt master plan that was done many years ago.”
 Construction started last year, but was halted in December due to cold temperatures, rainfall and COVID-19 concerns. Work resumed in June and wrapped up last month.
 “This shows who we are and what’s important to us,” said Vice-Mayor Colette George. “Right now, when we’re looking at what COVID has done to the world and how people are rethinking our social activity, our lives and priorities ... you can tell we’ve moved in the right direction for over 30 years.”
 The cost of the new extension was roughly $940,000, with 80% of the money coming from a Tennessee Department of Transportation grant. Glass Machinery & Excavation of Jonesville, Virginia, performed the work.
 “I often brag about the hidden gem that Kingsport has with the Greenbelt system. It’s a truly wonderful facility and not only a transportation facility, but a spine to the vibrancy of the community you have all built,” said Preston Elliott, TDOT Environmental and Planning Bureau chief. “It provides a unique, active transportation opportunity that plenty of communities marvel at.”
 Kingsport is also planning to extend the Greenbelt from Rotherwood Drive down Netherland Inn Road to Lewis Lane.
 The extension would be roughly 0.6 miles long and be mostly paid for with state grant funds.
 The western extension is still in the environmental review period as required by TDOT, and a timeline for its construction has not been determined.
 “Someone asked me why I’ve served on this committee for over 30 years, and one reason is that unlike other committees I’ve served on, we do something,” said John McCoy, a member of the Kingsport Greenbelt Committee. “We get out and build something, not just discuss policy and direction. Doing something this tangible makes it a lot of fun.”

"Choice" is a mantra of the radical feminists -- but the Elliot Institute has documented that in about two-thirds of cases, women feel pressured and/or coerced into having abortions they don't want, because the unintended result of making abortion legal for any reason whatever has made it the default option if a pregnancy happens under less than ideal conditions. So why do the "pro-choice" crowd fight tooth and nail against organizations that work to give women real alternatives to abortion?

MSA Safety's next dividend payment will be US$0.43 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.72 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, MSA Safety stock has a trailing yield of around 1.3% on the current share price of $135.69. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether MSA Safety can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.

The council’s barrister, John Hunter, told the court that the local authority had served several notices requiring the family to move on and offered them space at the council’s traveller transit site in Runcorn.
 However, Mr Price Sr explained to the court there would have been a “cultural difference” with Romani families already at the Runcorn site that would put them “in danger”.
 After receiving the enforcement notices from the council, the Prices applied for planning permission to turn the site into six traveller pitches, but their application was refused on October 20.
 In the meantime, the family remained on the site until an incident on August 3 that saw police called to the site and three members of the family, including Mr Price Sr and Mr Price Jr, arrested.
 The family then left the land, which has also been made subject to a police closure order until November 24 and is currently vacant.

--DocBreak--
The Job Retention Scheme, which was introduced alongside the national lockdown in March and helped keep a lid on unemployment, was due to expire at the end of October and to be replaced by a less generous program. However, it was reinstated on Saturday when the government abruptly announced another lockdown for England to last until Dec. 2.The lockdown will see millions of workers going idle once again as it requires all non-essential venues such as pubs, restaurants, and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers, to close. The support package for self-employed workers was also made more generous.“It’s clear the economic effects are much longer lasting for businesses than the duration of any restrictions, which is why we have decided to go further with our support,” Sunak told lawmakers.The extension was welcomed by all types of businesses as it relieves the pressure on them in what would traditionally be the busiest and financially most important time of the year — the run-up to Christmas.“Hospitality is facing a tough winter, so this enhanced support is crucial and will safeguard jobs and help businesses to plan for more certain future,” said Kate Nicholls, CEO of the U.K. Hospitality lobby group.The Bank of England estimates that the number of people on furlough will more than double in November to 5.5 million. At the height of the program in the spring, around 9 million workers, or around a third of the workforce, were on furlough.The government had for months balked at calls for an extension, arguing it wasn’t its role to support every job in the economy forever. It was no doubt also concerned about the cost of the program, which has reached 40 billion pounds.While welcoming the move, the main opposition Labour Party criticized Sunak for failing to act sooner, a delay that it says generated uncertainty and prompted some firms to dismiss staff in recent weeks. The government said the furlough scheme could be backdated so anyone who was on a payroll on Sept. 23 but then made redundant, can be re-employed.“This cycle of bluster, denial and then running to catch up is costing jobs and causing chaos,” said Labour’s economy spokeswoman, Anneliese Dodds.Though the furlough program prevented mass unemployment, the jobless rate has edged up from a four-decade low of 3.8% to 4.5%, with the likes of British Airways, Royal Mail and Rolls-Royce all laying off thousands.On Thursday, supermarket chain Sainsbury’s became the latest big company to announce hefty cuts. It said it will shed around 3,500 jobs as part of plans to permanently close its meat, fish and deli counters, as well as some of its Argos standalone stores.Sunak’s latest change came after the Bank of England warned that the British economy is set for another downturn in the winter, with the economy forecast to contract a further 2% in the fourth quarter. It laid out the hope that a recession — widely defined as two straight quarters of contraction — may be avoided but said the outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”Given that backdrop, its nine-member policymaking panel agreed to increase the bank’s bond-buying program in an attempt to ensure banks carry on lending to the wider economy. The stimulus was bigger than the 100 billion pounds anticipated in financial markets. The Monetary Policy Committee also unanimously kept the bank’s main interest rate at a record low of 0.1%.“We believe there is value in acting quickly and strongly to support the economy and avoid the risks of any short-term disruption,” Bank Governor Andrew Bailey told reporters.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at MSA Safety, with earnings per share up 9.0% on average over the last five years. Management have been reinvested more than half of the company's earnings within the business, and the company has been able to grow earnings with this retained capital. Organisations that reinvest heavily in themselves typically get stronger over time, which can bring attractive benefits such as stronger earnings and dividends.

 # School in a pandemic: Emma Doherty
 Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise
 My opinion of this school year is definitely crazy and it's very hectic. I think that we really don't need masks in the first place, only if you need it, and they are so irritating and weird.
 My school day is very different from other years, that’s for sure. Now I'm confused with everything mostly. Last year in middle school they didn't even teach us how to use the Chromebooks with submitting work on Canvas, etc. We usually did everything on paper, and now they kind of forced Canvas upon us, and I still believe we need more work on submitting things and how kids don't know how to speak out when then need help. Also, I think they should unblock a lot of the websites, and also give us free time to play stuff on our Chromebooks like fun mind games.
 Also, we don't really have time for homework because of sports and doctor appointments. A lot of us are going through so much stuff like parents getting divorced and stuff we can't even speak about, so that's a big problem. I don't know about some classes, but a few of mine are OK when it comes to homework and I don't have to worry about that, which helps me a lot.
 In all, just a super boring year, and we literally have nothing but sports, and some of us can't even go to.

An important step to reduce risk within a group is having a conversation about it and getting everyone on the same page in terms of the risk they expose themselves to in their daily lives. Popescu pointed me to this worksheet of questions intended to help people set up quarantine pods (i.e. groups of people who socialize among themselves but generally cut themselves off from broader social interactions) as being a helpful starting point. Families should ask one another, for instance, “How often do you wear a mask, and where?” Getting everyone joining a gathering to reduce their personal risk reduces the risk for everyone.
