Pivac, who took charge after last year's World Cup, said the team led by skipper Alun Wyn Jones had been fired up in training as they seek a first Six Nations win over England at Twickenham since 2012.
 "The level of intensity has noticeably gone up in training, certainly in the live stuff, and it has been no holds barred," Pivac told reporters.
 "That tells me a big performance is coming. You've only got to listen to Alun Wyn during the week. The intensity is there in his voice and everything he's done in training. He's led from the front.
 "Clearly they've got a great record (at Twickenham) and one we respect. It is one which tells us we'll have to be at the peak of our powers to win."

The Warriors’ top priority in this tank season was to dip under the luxury tax line, re-setting their penalties as repeating violators. Now, there’s no virtue in being cheap, but there’s nothing smart about paying top dollar for a bad team, either. In trading away Willie Cauley-Stein, Glenn Robinson III, Alec Burks, and then Omari Spellman and Jacob Evans on Thursday alongside Russell (Wiggins’ contract is effectively equal in cost to the guard’s), the Warriors dipped under the line — all while acquiring six draft picks (two 2020 second-round picks, a 2021 first-round pick, two 2021 second-round picks, and a 2022 second-round pick).

“Casper is a talented team, well-coached by a good friend and made us earn the win,” Fehringer said. “There is more work to be down and our hearts will be tested yet again (Friday, March 6).”
 WNCC advances to the semifinals when they face Northeastern Junior College at 7 p.m. with a berth into the championship game on the line. NJC topped Central Wyoming College 90-68 to advance.
 The other semifinal at 5 p.m. will pit Gillette College against Western Wyoming Community College. Western Wyoming topped McCook 82-69 while Gillette earned an 89-75 win over Otero Junior College.
 The contest went back and forth in the first half. WNCC held a 51-49 lead late in the first until Casper banked in a half-court shot to lead by one 52-51.
 Casper pushed the lead to double digits early in the second half only to watch WNCC come back to slice the lead to two, 69-67, on a Kenny Strawbridge bucket. Casper went back in front 75-71 only to watch WNCC go on an 8-0 run to lead 79-75 behind five Strawbridge points.
 The game stayed tight until Casper went up 95-90 and later 97-92. The Cougars defense picked up, holding Casper scoreless the rest of the way in the second half. WNCC tied the game with 12.7 seconds to play on a Kalen Williams 3-pointer forcing overtime.
 Casper scored first in the overtime, but Jared Rosser nailed a 3-pointer for a 100-99 lead. Casper came right back to hit a bucket. The Cougars then went on a 6-0 run behind a bucket by Elie Cadet and four points from Williams to lead 106-101.

Googs endured 40 unremarkable games for a team bereft of talent and charisma. Come to think of it, the Warriors pawned him off on the Timberwolves before the season was up that year, same as they did Russell.

She played Bhoomi in _Muthyala Muggu_ (her all-time favourite role) and also Meenakshi, a visually-challenged girl who transforms her disability into strength to protect her family. Yyamini reveals that doing only four projects in a span of eight years was an informed choice. “Too many characters can sometimes evoke boredom among the audience. I wanted to carve a niche and create an identity for my roles.”
 For Yyamini, playing Laya is special as the character is close to her in real life.

MARLBOROUGH -- Jeff Granatino, president of the MIAA, called it a "paradigm shift."
 Starting in the fall of 2021, the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) will ditch the regional-based sectional tournaments -- North, South, Central and West -- in favor of a statewide bracket for high school playoffs. Representatives from the 380 MIAA member schools voted 193-140 in favor of the change during a meeting Friday at Assabet Valley Tech.
 "It's a bold and comprehensive plan to improve our tournament structure and provide the most equitable and competitive path to a championship," said Derek Folan, a member of the MIAA's Tournament Management Committee. "Most importantly, the plan enhances the student experience as they enter the magical and special experience of tournament play."
 Folan said the plan was made to provide a more equal chance for teams to compete for a state title. An example of this can be seen in Division 3 boys hockey. Only four teams qualified for the postseason in the Div. 3 West Sectional, compared to 17 in the South, 13 in the North and six in the Central. The South champion will need to win at least six games to win a state title while the West champion only needs four.
 One argument against the statewide tournament was the potential for pitting teams four hours apart in a tournament game.
 The potential benefits of the new format, highlighted by the TMC, include trying to resolve gender-equity issues, creating an equal path to a state championship and allowing teams from a similar area of the state to be able to square off in a state final. While some towns loved the area-based rivalries and the accomplishment of winning a sectional title, the sectionals will be eliminated entirely in the new format.
 Under the new plan, all divisions will be realigned for each sport. Using MaxPreps' proprietary ranking system, which rewards scheduling tougher games, the top 32 teams from all over the state in each division will qualify for the playoffs. Any remaining teams with a .500 record or better will be added to the bracket, but will have to play their way into the main field by winning qualifying games.
 Once the TMC concluded their informational presentation, attendees and school representatives voiced their opinions about the proposal. Several representatives in support and against the proposal provided feedback and concerns before the vote was held.
 One of the issues brought up was valuing the input of the students. Granby Athletic Director Alison Jordan asked the TMC panel why student representatives were not allowed to cast a vote in the process. Some attendees considered the new format to be a threat to the academic integrity of students for having to travel long distances across the state for a tournament game.
 In response, the TMC added that it was the responsibility of athletic directors to coordinate with their own student-athletes to come to a unified vote by the time of the assembly.
 "We voted yes to look at going to the statewide tournament format," said Brockton athletic director Kevin Karo. "I think, for us, it's a good choice because I feel in the past, a lot of the better teams have come out of our section and we ended up playing each other in the sectional finals. It will bring a lot of good parity across the state."
 "I think it's a big change that a lot of people are nervous about," said Abington athletic director Peter Serino. "But in my opinion it's a change and opportunity to be a really great thing for student athletes."
 The principal of Pembroke High School, Marc Talbot, was also in attendance to offer his input.
 "My reaction to the vote is a little bit surprised," said Talbot. "I didn't know it would pass by the margin that it did. But the reason why we voted yes was I am interested in the environment a statewide tournament can provide. I think the cons, like travel time, would not be universally applied and we don't know that yet."
 While the proposal passed by 53-vote margin, there was still some unease among the school reps who voted no.
 "We weighed all the pros and cons, and our biggest concern was how it was going to affect kids in the classroom," said Norwell girls basketball coach Matt Marani, who is an assistant principal at the school. "We believe in the instruction and education of our students and time out of the classroom is a concern. And at the end of the day we are an instructional institution and we're hoping we can provide the same extracurricular experiences traveling across the state."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Results were expected Friday after passengers and crew were tested for coronavirus aboard a cruise ship held off the California coast.A passenger on an earlier voyage of the ship died of the disease, and at least four others became infected.While more than 3,500 aboard the Grand Princess were ordered to stay at sea, only 45 people were tested.A military helicopter delivered test kits to the Grand Princess, which is anchored off San Francisco.Meanwhile, the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus has reached 12 and infections swell to more than 200 cases, scattered across 18 states.North Korea says it has released about 220 foreigners from a quarantine imposed as part of its vigilant prevention efforts to avoid an outbreak of the coronavirus that has spread around the world.The country has not publicly disclosed any cases of COVID-19, but outsiders are skeptical it escaped the virus that erupted in its neighbor and closest ally China and has infected more than 98,000 people globally.COVID-19 has proven challenging to identify, contain and treat in well-off countries, and experts worry an outbreak could be devastating in impoverished North Korea, which has a malnourished population and a chronic shortage of medical supplies.The number of infections with the new virus is nearing 100,000 and economic consequences are spreading around the globe. Asian shares are down following a rough day on Wall Street, and halted travel and a broader downturn are threatening to hit already-struggling communities for months to come. The head of the U.N.’s food agency is warning of the potential of “absolute devastation” as the outbreak’s effects ripple through Africa and the Middle East. That comes as the outbreak continues to shift away from Asia to Europe, the Mideast and the United States. The number of new infections is dropping in both the epicenter of China and the other hardest-hit country, South Korea.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

CARVER - Head coach Rich Valetkevicz categorized his hockey team's season as a "roller coaster ride," and for the third time in his five-year tenure, the Vikings qualified for tournament action.
 In the first round of the tournament, the Vikings (11-8-1) came up short against the Whitman Hanson Panthers (15-4-1) at Gallo Ice Arena, 8-2. The game itself was a bit of a roller coaster in its own right. Whitman Hanson came out of the gates strong, scoring four consecutive goals in the first period. The Panthers simply looked more physical in the opening period, until the Vikings ramped it up in the second, cutting the four goal deficit in half. With 2:50 left in the second period, it looked like Wareham/Carver had a shot. They capitalized on a power play for their first goal and moments later, sophomore Noah Reardon found the back of the net to tally on another. The Vikings' fan section was invigorated, they were alive, but that didn't last for long. That was the closest the Vikings would come.
 "Yeah, we got a slow start, but between the first and second period, (we) fired them up in the locker room, got them going. We seemed to come out a lot better in the second. We dominated, I thought, the second period, made it 4-2. We had a five-on-three, which I think hurt us. I think if we scored on the five-on-three, and got (the score to) 4-3 or even 4-4, it would've been a different ball game. I think they thought they had it in the bag at 4-0, and they laid back in the second. Then, we didn't score, and when we didn't score, just running two lines tired my kids out," he said.
 Whitman Hanson went on to tack on two more quick goals before the second period expired. From there, the Panthers had two more goals in store during the third quarter. They quickly stomped out any potential comeback the Vikings had in mind.
 Wire to wire, the Panthers came to play and by the end of the night, Wareham/Carver's season was over. Sure, it wasn't quite the ending they had in mind, but they certainly have a reason to be proud of how the season went.
 Through the first seven games of the season, the team went 3-3-1 and outscored opponents 32-28 during that stretch. It was an eight-game stretch in the middle of the season that really propelled the Vikings into contention. They went 6-2 between Jan. 12 and Feb. 5, while outscoring their opponents 29-21 and averaged about three and a half goals per game during that month-long stretch. They got more consistent and turned their fate around.
 "We did take on a couple of tougher teams this year like Dennis-Yarmouth, Nauset and Scituate, even though we beat Nauset twice, they were tough. They were good games. I think it was a roller coaster ride, no question about it. It was a bit up and down, but I think the last month, the end of January through February, we lost (a few) games by a goal. If you take a few of those away and put them in the win column, I think we would've jumped up higher in the bracket and it would have made a difference, but overall, I'm very happy with this season, no question about it," Valetkevicz said.
 The Vikings will graduate three seniors this spring and they all played significant roles throughout their careers - goaltender Alex Demarco, defensemen Bryan Gallagher, and forward Quirino doCanto. Coach Valetkevicz talked about his senior group departing and what it's going to take to remain competitive going forward.
 "(It'll take) a lot of hard work. A lot of the kids, hopefully they work harder in the offseason. I do have some young kids coming up that have a lot of potential, and if they work hard in the offseason, I think a lot of them will step right into some starting roles. It's going to be tough, depending on goaltending. Obviously losing Demarco is going to be tough, I do have three other goalies and I think it'll be a battle for the starting position."
 Junior Tyler Lovendale scored his 100th career point in the later stages of this past season and with Quirino doCanto graduating, he'll be losing his right hand man. Lovendale's provided the program with a lot of points and contributions, but this new season will be a unique one without his favorite target probing the wing. Valetkevicz is excited to see him adapt to the new circumstances and he liked how Lovendale battled out of the slump he started the season with.
 "He started off slow, no question about it. He had a slow start this year, but he came on real strong. He ended up with 15 goals and 22 assists, like 32 points. I think it'll be a little bit different from him (next year). Him and Q have been partners next to each other since they were babies. They've been side-by-side, and now that's Q's gone, it'll be interesting. I think it'll be good for him. He's a hard worker, he's a great kid, and he goes out and does his job. He's just one of those kids that, no matter where you need him, he'll do it. Anything to win a hockey game. A great kid and I'm looking forward to working with him next year."

Trey Wolff and Austin McNamara made Texas Tech special teams coordinator Mark Tommerdahl look like a wise man last football season.
   
 McNamara's big leg helped Tech rank fourth in the FBS in net punting, and Wolff made 20 of 22 field goals. Both being freshmen, they turned special teams from the Red Raiders' biggest question mark before the 2019 season into one of its perceived strong suits.
   
 To a certain extent, anyway. The field goal, extra-point and punt teams were elite, Tommerdahl said, quickly acknowledging the adjective is overused in today's game, but he wants excellence everywhere.
   
 "Those were the best units, but that's not really positive," he said, "because when this program's cooking, all six of our units should be at that level. We're just not there yet."
   
 So Tommerdahl will try to shore up everything else over the next several weeks. The Red Raiders on Thursday went through their second of the allotted 15 sessions of spring football practice.
   
 One of the units that can use work is kickoff coverage. Of the 130 FBS teams, Tech ranked tied for 125th in that department with a yield of 26.50 yards per return. Giving up a kickoff-return touchdown was a key breakdown in a 30-27 loss to Kansas State.
   
 The Red Raiders didn't generate a lot of big plays in their own return game, in particular punt returns, where Tech's average runback of 5.87 yards ranked 90th.
   
 How does he go about making special teams a plus across the board?
   
 "That's spring ball. That's practice," Tommerdahl said, "and, again, I don't think you really blame personnel. I can sit here and put it on the players and say, 'We've got new guys coming in.' That's really secondary.
   
 "We've just got to to get fundamentally better at what we do, and that's every day out here."
   
 Still, McNamara and Wolff give the Red Raiders a foundation. Assuming they don't go anywhere and don't regress, they should provide the Red Raiders with dependable specialists for the next three years.
   
 McNamara averaged 45.0 yards per punt, fourth-best on the Tech single-season chart, and he did it as a rail-thin true freshman.
   
 "He's just got to continue to improve," Tommerdahl said. "I know he had a good freshman year. And now he's just got to keep getting better, and he will just with going through an off-season with (strength and conditioning coach Dave) Scholz. That's going to be huge for him, just to mature, because he's a skinny freshman."
   
 Of the 19 kickers in the FBS who made at least 20 field goals last year, only four converted at a higher percentage than Wolff's 90.9. Among all kickers, Wolff's percentage was still seventh in the FBS.
   
 McNamara brought a reputation with him to Tech as one of the nation's top high-school punter recruits. Wolff redshirted in 2018, and the kicking job appeared wide open among three untested candidates going into 2019.
   
 Wolff quickly put to rest any unease or uncertainty.
   
 "He probably surprised us from spring to fall," Tommerdahl said, "because we came out of spring ball quite uncertain, and he just had a great summer, and we probably weren't surprised (at his performance) by the end of fall camp.
   
 "That time between the end of spring ball and fall, we weren't quite sure what we were going to have, so that was a surprise. As the season went on, he really became trusted. He's got a tremendous demeanor. Tremendous."
   
 Asked to elaborate, Tommerdahl said, "Not much bothers him. If he misses a kick, he can move on to the next one."
   
 One priority for Wolff this spring and summer is kickoffs. He had 36 touchbacks in 72 kickoffs last year, and the frequency diminished as the season wore on. So, as with McNamara, Tech coaches want him to add strength.
   
 "Some of that is my job, too," Tommerdahl said. "We've got to make sure we keep him fresh, but that will be his biggest emphasis in the off-season is just to make his touchback percentage on kickoffs stay consistent throughout the whole year, because he did wear down as the year went on."

Overhead electrification work up to Karaikal from Tiruvarur is expected to be completed by this month-end, Southern Railway General Manager John Thomas said on Friday.
 Mr. Thomas told reporters at Karaikal that electrification work up to Karaikal Port would be completed by April. “After April, we are trying to see that all trains from Karaikal Port and from Karaikal are run on electric traction."
 The overhead electrification work was being carried out by the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification.
 Asked about the commencement of the new broad gauge line work from Karaikal to Peralam, Mr. Thomas said the project had already been sanctioned. “As of now there is a shortage of funds. As and when funds are released the pace of the work will increase.”
 Mr. Thomas said he would inspect the Karaikal Port which gave the Southern Railway maximum revenue and maximum loading of coal for Mettur Dam thermal power plant, and also for other areas in and around Karaikal.The General Manager said he had come to see the needs of the Karaikal Port to improve the handling of traffic by rail to the extent possible.
 Accompanied by senior Southern Railway officials, Mr. John Thomas would later in the day carry out a ‘window trailing’ inspection travelling on board a special train from Karaikal to Tiruchi.

SAN ANTONIO -- The Shallowater Fillies will charge into Saturday's state final at full speed.
   
 No. 8-ranked Shallowater rolled to a 61-26 win over No. 5 Schulenburg on Thursday at the UIL Girls State Basketball Championships at the Alamodome in San Antonio.
   
 The Fillies improved to 38-2 and advanced to play Woodville (36-4) in the Class 3A state final at 10 a.m. Saturday at the same venue.
   
 It's Shallowater's first appearance in the state final since 2015, when it lost to Sunnyvale.
   
 The Fillies' suffocating defense was too much for Schulenburg to handle.
   
 "That's what's got us here," Shallowater head coach Chuck Darden said. "As you can tell, we're not the biggest team on the floor, and we haven't been all year. We know we've got to get a tremendous effort on defense and on rebounding, and they've done that all year long.
   
 "Today, I thought, was a tremendous effort against a good offensive team in Schulenburg. It's a credit to our kids and the fight they have. They play smart 'D' and we didn't get in any foul trouble today, and I think that was a big key for us."
   
 Shallowater snapped a five-year state tourney drought this season, but the Fillies have been knocking on the door for some time. Everything fell into place this time around.
   
 "The last two or three years, we've had good teams and we just got beat by good teams in one- or two-possession games," Darden said. "This group, we played some unbelievable games in our district. Idalou was the No. 1 team in the state for quite a few weeks, and then we were.
   
 "And then Brownfield beat both us and Idalou, so our district was tremendously tough. And then in the playoff games, the Bushland game was down to the wire, and Jim Ned and Idalou (were tough). Sometimes you've just got to have the ball bounce the right direction for you."
   
 The Fillies won the state title in 2004 and also played in state finals in 2003 and 1997.
   
 Schulenburg's season ended with a record of 34-5.
   
 Shallowater was leading Schulenburg 11-7 midway through the first quarter before taking command with a remarkable 29-6 run to end the half.
   
 Just like that, Shallowater had a 40-13 halftime lead, and the Fillies' fans could already start making plans for Saturday's final.
   
 Shallowater was led by sophomore guard Bree Brattain, who had 21 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, a steal and a block.
   
 Taylor Moravcik added 12 points, nine rebounds and two steals.
   
 Shallowater's defense held Schulenburg to 9-of-40 shooting. The Fillies shot 21-of-67 from the floor.
   
 Schulenburg was led by Brynlee Hollas with 10 points, seven rebounds, a block and a steal.
   
 The Fillies had some recent injuries that took a toll on the team.
   
 "The kids just fought through all that and I think they're resilient," Darden said. "We've had one goal in mind and we're nearly there."
   
 The Shallowater players said it'll be a little difficult to get to sleep Friday night, on the eve of the biggest game of their careers.
   
 "I'm super excited and I think the rest of the team is, too," Shallowater junior guard Tynli Harris said.
   
 The Fillies have a game plan to shake off the nerves in the title game.
   
 "We're going to work so hard in practice (Friday) that they'll be so tired that they'll sleep like babies," Darden said. "We're excited, but we should be. When you're playing for a state championship and you're not excited, something's wrong."
   
 Brattain came within five points of matching Schulenburg's point production all by herself, but she wasn't tooting her own horn.
   
 "(Wednesday) we got to shoot in that gym, so it was a good feeling," Brattain said. "I just thought we all worked together as a team and it got us all open, so I couldn't have done it without my team."
