Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the Tokyo organizing committee, expressed his own reservations 10 days ago. Since then, the organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee have said there is no "Plan B'' other than working for the Olympics to open on July 23, 2021.
 “I am very pessimistic about holding the Olympic Games next summer unless you hold the Olympic Games in a totally different structure such as no audience, or a very limited participation," Iwata said, speaking at a forum arranged by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo.

After speaking on the floor, McConnell donned a face mask to talk briefly to reporters at the Capitol, telling them that negotiations are continuing.
 The White House initially had wanted to increase the Small Business Administration’s PPP by $251 billion, but Democrats demanded additional changes, which added to the legislation’s size and scope. Republicans rejected Democrats’ attempt to include $150 billion for city and state budgets that have been slammed by the pandemic, but agreed to include $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing.
 As they finalized the package, lawmakers were circling around an increase of $310 billion for the PPP, of which $60 billion would be reserved for smaller financial institutions to distribute. Half of that would be provisioned for lenders with less than $10 billion in assets and the other half for institutions with between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets. An additional $60 billion in loans and grants would go to a separate small-business emergency lending program that is out of money.
 Congressional aides cautioned Monday that details remained in flux.
 Lawmakers and the administration worked late into Sunday night trying to hammer out the agreement, but Democrats said Monday that issues remained unresolved on testing, hospital spending and some elements of the small- business programs. They also insisted they had not abandoned their push for some relief for state and local governments but that Republicans continued to reject those demands.
 If the Senate succeeds in passing the legislation Tuesday, the House could pass it Wednesday. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., informing House members late Sunday that they should expect to return to the Capitol on Wednesday to vote on the legislation.
 Both chambers are out of session, but Republicans have made it clear they will insist on a roll-call vote in the House, which will require a majority of lawmakers to be present. That also could present House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., with an opportunity to push through the creation of a new select committee to oversee the coronavirus response, as well as a new proxy voting system that would allow lawmakers to vote from afar by delegating colleagues to vote for them.
 In videos on Twitter and in an interview with CNBC, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., the principal author of the PPP, defended it amid reports of large companies getting loans, in some cases with more than one affiliate receiving the maximum $10 million. The loans are supposed to go to companies with fewer than 500 employees and would not need to be repaid if the businesses keep workers on their payrolls.
 Rubio said some companies had been approved for loans that he didn’t think should have been, but he hopes regulations will be tightened to prevent that from happening.
 “Look, there were glitches made, no doubt about it,” Rubio said. “But, in the end, take comfort in the fact that the money has to go to the workers ultimately. It doesn’t really matter who the worker’s working for; we want to keep them employed.
 “This is not a bailout of any company. But I think, certainly, the goal here is to get money into the hands of businesses who don’t have anywhere else to go for money, including the stock market, shareholders, other sort of credit lines.”
 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., spoke in favor of the potential agreement in an interview on Fox Business. He said Democrats are holding it up to make demands.
 “What it would do is something that we’ve been requesting for the last two weeks, more funding for the small-business program,” McCarthy said. “This business program has worked very well; more than 1.6 million businesses requested the money to pay their employees, to pay their rent.”

A potential surge of COVID-19 patients at Sudbury's hospital may come yet, but so far the situation is far better than many feared.
 As of noon on Monday, Health Sciences North was reporting just two admitted patients who had tested positive for the illness -- one fewer than last week.
 One of those patients is in the intensive care unit, the hospital said in media statement.
 Nine patients, meanwhile, remain under investigation for the coronavirus, and five of those patients are in the ICU.
 That, too, is a reduction from late last week, when there were 16 patients under investigation, although at that time only two were in intensive care.
 The emergency department remains open around the clock and is a "safe and secure place for anyone who needs urgent or emergency care," the hospital reassured.
 Restrictions remain in place, however, for visiting and accessing the Ramsey Lake Health Centre.
 Only essential visitors are welcome at this time, HSN stressed.
 They include people visiting a dying or very ill patient, a parent/guardian of an ill child or youth, a visitor for a person undergoing surgery or giving birth, or a support person for patients with a cognitive or language impairment or language barrier.
 Essential visitors will continue to be screened for symptoms when entering the building and will be turned away if they don't meet the criteria.
 While the ER entrance remains open for those needing emergency care, access to the Ramsey Lake Health Centre is limited to the main entrance.
 Patients requiring cancer treatment are asked to continue using the main entrance of the Cancer Centre for their appointments.
 All other entrances are closed.
 Parking remains free at all HSN sites for patients and staff until May 31.

The University of Akron continues its updates from across the country and the world in what it calls Postcards from The Zips. Up next, from women's swimming and diving is Akron sophomore Kamryn Goodrick (Chesterland, Ohio).
   
 First off, are you and your family doing well?
   
 Yes, my family and I are doing very well. We're a little spread out right now, as my oldest sister and her family are staying down in Florida at their private house. As for us that are up here in Ohio, we have been taking lots of hikes, doing home workouts, playing board games, and watching movies. If you can't tell yet, we are really taking advantage of our family time. We've started some little at-home projects anywhere from gardening, to building stuff, and even just the classic spring cleaning. My father, sister, and I have also been gearing up to try and make my mom's upcoming birthday as special as we can for her.
   
 With time for reflection have you been able to wrap your head around what has occurred?
   
 At times it feels like I have, but sometimes it's hard because things keep changing so rapidly at times. Plus, for my parent's business, which revolves around social gatherings (weddings, sporting events, graduations, etc.) there is a lot of unknown for us right now, so that part has been hard.
   
 Talk about the importance of your family and knowing that they are safely back home?
   
 I have always been a very family-oriented person. That is part of why Akron was the perfect fit for me, between the great programs academically that I was looking at, the phenomenal swimming and diving team, and a great distance from home. I have 22 first cousins on my dad's side alone, as well as being one of five siblings, so to be able to be home and doing all sorts of bonding with them has definitely been the silver lining in all of this.
   
 What is daily life like this week knowing that you're expected to stay inside your homes?
   
 We try to keep a schedule together and fill our days with activities. A lot of times my younger sister and I will work on our homework all morning. Once we are done with that I usually get in a workout, then start whatever new project we're trying to tackle that day or days to come or go for a hike. It sometimes depends on the weather though, if it's raining, we will leave the outdoor projects for another day. I drive a mustang convertible, so my dad and I spent three days last week changing out the old top and putting on a new one, so things like this. We have also been taking our time making and trying new meals/dishes that we might not have had the time to try before. My mom made this Ethiopian dish for dinner a few days ago that was so good.
   
 Discuss your feelings as the events were occurring that ultimately led to the cancellation of spring sports?
   
 I understand and have come to terms with the very good reasons for canceling such events. However, a big part of me is feeling cheated out of my college experience. I was told by several people at the beginning of the year to redshirt since I had had surgery on my elbow for issues with my nerves on July 23. Since then, I had overcome many setbacks throughout the year mentally and physically. When they stopped the zone meet, I was in seventh place, and the top-seven go to nationals. So, I was very proud at the time to know given surgery and every setback since then, that I was capable of competing at that level and possibly going to nationals. But at the same time, I also felt very defeated knowing I could have redshirted. I do not think I would change what I did though because overcoming setbacks and doing what people believe I might not be capable of is where a lot of motivation came from this season.
   
 Discuss your communication with your teammates around the world and back here in Ohio during this time?
   
 Our team has a very tight bond with one another. We are one of the few teams that has training over winter break and all of summer break, due to our seasons. We all have been staying connected by sending funny pictures and videos in our group to me, and our new Marco Polo app. Aside from that my one roommate/teammate is from California and her family did not want her to get on a plane to fly home, so my family has become her new family away from home. I have also stayed in touch with many teammates through annual memories on Snapchat or other social media, which reminds us of what we were doing at this time last year. Sometimes it makes us sad, but overall it is a fun thing for us to look back on and have a conversation other than COVID-19.
   
 Can you describe what it has means to be a Zip, especially during this time?
   
 Being a part of the athletic community in Akron during this time has definitely been a light in all of this. Their social media has constantly been posting positive pictures and acknowledging the athletes who have worked for that acknowledgment. Seeing these pictures reminds me of better times when all the sporting facilities were full, the JAR had all my friends in it, and sporting events were going on giving us a place to hang out and support one another. Even just knowing that I am a part of a huge and caring team, that are all going through this together, helps me not feel so lonely at times like this. I am forever grateful that Akron has given me a home away from home, and a family away from family. The support coming from every direction, keeping everyone positive is also very appreciated.

We've managed it well so far. Cleaning the factories, lots of hand gel, even things like putting plastic barriers between some of the assembly stations, we're in the process of ramping up PPE gloves, taking people's temperatures, those sort of things. And so we're like most of industrial America, we're working our way through this. We had a shutdown in our two French factories, we had a shut down in our Marshalltown factory because we had some cases and also quite a few quarantines, but both those factories are up and running. As I speak today -- I didn't check first thing this morning, but as I speak today, all our factories are running. Different levels of absenteeism in our factories as people stay away from work. And again, this isn't a political statement. It's just an observation that our factories in places like Iowa, Arkansas, Georgia, and they're not in New York City, they're not in California. And so some of our workers have a different perspective on the virus than I do maybe. And so they're coming to work, but even beyond that, we're taking care of them. Make sure it works.

The key question when it comes to possible debt relief by China really depends on which debt is being discussed. Forgiving zero-interest loans for poor and least-developed countries in Africa has been a tradition for China. In 2005, China announced forgiveness of $10 billion zero-interest loans for Africa. By the first quarter of 2009, China had canceled 150 such loans owed by 32 African countries. In 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced forgiveness of all intergovernmental zero-interest loans for least-developed African countries with diplomatic relations with China.

Fit is a very important factor for anyone who would slide into that open scholarship spot. Huggins is very happy with the roster he built last offseason, and he was rewarded for the work. After a 2018-19 campaign that ended in a 21-loss season, the 2019-20 roster finished 21-10 and ranked No. 24 in the country.
 Notable additions were freshmen Oscar Tshiebwe and Miles McBride, junior college transfers Taz Sherman and Sean McNeil and Arkansas transfer Gabe Osabuohien. Now Cottrell, Thweat and Johnson will arrive and if Huggins adds a fourth newcomer, that player isn’t going to be a fly in the ointment.
 “I think with us, it’s important that, if we take another guy, that he fits,” Huggins said. “And we take another guy that can come in and help these guys achieve their goals. They’ve been a great group. They’ve been terrific on and off the floor. They’re really excited about being able to get back. They enjoy being at West Virginia.”
 The Mountaineers were in the mix for Ohio State transfer Luther Muhammad. The former four-star prospect had WVU in his final five prospective destinations along with Seton Hall, New Mexico, Arizona State and UCLA, ultimately choosing the Sun Devils.
 Missing out on Muhammad doesn’t have Huggins antsy to hand out that final scholarship. In fact, he said, he might not hand it out at all if he doesn’t find a player that enhances the roster. There’s no sense in his mind of messing with a good thing.
 “I’m not concerned about it, because if we don’t, we don’t,” Huggins said. “We’re not going to be able to play 13 guys anyway, let’s be honest. So in a lot of ways, it makes our decisions a little easier. Obviously if something falls in our laps … I just want to make 100-percent sure that they fit in. We’ve got a great chemistry right now. I don’t know how you get a better situation than what we’ve got right now.”

But Trump’s advisers are divided about the wisdom of encouraging the protests. At some of them, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, has been compared to Adolf Hitler. At least one protester had a sign featuring a swastika.
 One adviser said privately that if someone were to be injured at the protests — or if anyone contracted the coronavirus at large events where people were not wearing masks — there would be potential political risk for the president.
 But two other people close to the president, who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly, said they thought the protests could be politically helpful to Trump, while acknowledging there might be public health risks.
 One of those people said that in much of the country, where the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths are not as high as in places like New York, New Jersey, California and Washington state, anger is growing over the economic losses that have come with the stringent social-distancing restrictions.
 And some states are already preparing to restart their economies. Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, took early actions against the spread of the virus, is planning a staged reopening beginning May 1.
 Still, as Trump did throughout 2016, as when he said “torture works” and then walked back that statement a short time later, or when he advocated bombing the Middle East while denouncing lengthy foreign engagements, he has long taken various sides of the same issue.
 Mobilizing anger and mistrust toward the government was a crucial factor for Trump in the last presidential election. And for many months he has been looking for ways to contrast himself with former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and a Washington lifer.
 The problem? Trump is now president, and disowning responsibility for his administration’s slow and problem-plagued response to the coronavirus could prove difficult. And protests can be an unpredictable factor, particularly at a moment of economic unrest.
 Vice President Mike Pence, asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” about the president’s tweets urging people to “liberate” states, demurred.
 “The American people know that no one in America wants to reopen this country more than President Donald Trump,” Pence said, “and on Thursday the president directed us to lay out guidelines for when and how states could responsibly do that.”
 “And in the president’s tweets and public statements, I can assure you, he’s going to continue to encourage governors to find ways to safely and responsibly let America go back to work,” he said.
 With the political campaign halted, Trump’s advisers have seen an advantage in the frozen-in-time state of the race. Biden has struggled to fundraise or even to get daily attention in the news cycle.
 But Trump himself has seemed at sea, according to people close to him, uncertain of how to proceed. His approval numbers in his campaign polling have settled back to a level consistent with before the coronavirus, according to multiple people familiar with the data.
 His campaign polling has shown that focusing on criticizing China, in contrast with Biden, moves voters toward Trump, according to a Republican who has seen it.
 “Trump finally fired the first shot” with his more aggressive stance toward the Chinese government and its leader, Xi Jinping, said Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist. “Xi is put on notice that the death, economic carnage and agony is his and his alone,” Bannon said. “Only question now: What is America’s president prepared to do about it?”

PLYMOUTH - James Kernen spent years dreaming of playing football for Plymouth South. He first stepped onto the sideline during a game as 6-year-old, serving as the team's water boy. Season after season, he rarely missed a game, always waiting for the day when he could wear the black and teal. And when he finally did, he made the most of it.
 "He was this little skinny kid with glasses," remembers recently retired Head Football Coach Scott Fry.
 Kernen isn't little or skinny anymore. Now 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, he was instrumental in leading the Panthers to the Division 4 Super Bowl last season, playing tackle on both sides of the ball. His play earned him a spot on the Patriot League All-Star team.
 "He dominated [opponents], but he's also a really good athlete," Fry said.
 Kernen was also selected to play in the prestigious Shriners High School All- Star Football Classic, which was scheduled to be played June 19 but was recently cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "It was an honor to be selected," he said. "It was a goal of mine since sophomore year. It was just really special for me and my family to be honored."
 Kernen's connection to the football program began when his childhood friend, Anthony Loranger, the son of wrestling coach Marc Loranger, asked him if he wanted to join him on the sidelines as the team water boy. "I said sure, and I did it every year, every game," he said.
 He was on the sidelines when the Panthers went to the 2013 Super Bowl, dreaming that it would be him someday. "I kept thinking when I get to that point, I want to do what they're doing, but better," he said.
 "Going into my sophomore year, I had no clue if I'd be playing," he said. "I just put my head down, worked out, tried to put on as much weight as I could and then see where the chips fell. When I started the first game, it was special to finally see all those dreams come to fruition."
 The fact that Kernen played tackle last season was testimony to his leadership qualities. When he first suited up at Plymouth South, he was a tight end. But Fry asked him to shift to the less-glamorous offense tackle position in his sophomore season. And after playing defensive end in his sophomore and junior years, Fry moved him to defensive tackle last season. Those are not the type of position changes many players would embrace, but Kernen did so without complaint.
 "He would do anything for the team," Fry said. "He had no problem doing whatever we needed him to do. He was the ultimate team player. He's probably one of the best captains I've ever had at South. He was all about winning football games, which is what made him such a good leader."
 By the time Fry asked him to switch position on defense last season, Kernen said, "I was kind of used to it at that point, so it just came naturally.
 "If it's best for the team, you just do it, no questions asked," he said.
 The highlight of Kernen's senior season came on Sept. 27 when the Panthers scored a touchdown with 16 seconds remaining to upset defending Super Bowl champion Scituate, 15-9.
 "This was a statement game for us," he said. "To come back in the last minute and score a touchdown … I've been around the program a long time and I think it was probably the loudest I'd heard that stadium in 11 years."
 The Panthers did not lose another game until the Super Bowl.
 A National Honor Roll student, Kernen will head to Assumption College in the fall to study business, with a focus on marketing. He'll also play football.
 "I think he'll be a phenomenal college player," Fry said. "He's just going to get better and better, because he has a tremendous work ethic."

However, each sub- ethnicity of the Yoruba, has its own slightly unique chieftaincy traditions which are tied to the apron strings of social history and micro geography. Despite the differences, the monarch of Ile-Ife (Ooni of Ife) is the popularly accepted leader of all the Yoruba obas. Ile-Ife was the spiritual capital of the Yoruba nation in antiquity. It has an unparalleled history of world-class artistic, scientific, and technical productions.

The stimulus checks landing in millions of Americans' bank accounts are meant to help people cope with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But they could also be helping debt collectors, thanks to a loophole in the $2 trillion stimulus package.
   
 The problem, legal advocates say, is that the stimulus checks aren't explicitly off-limits to debt collectors or creditors, unlike other government payments such as Social Security and disability benefits. That oversight means that debt collectors can garnish bank accounts to seize the stimulus payments, according to Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.
   
 Bank account garnishment happens when creditors are legally permitted to remove money from your bank account to cover an unpaid debt. In some states, bank accounts are frozen when they're garnished, a devastating development for many consumers. And that makes the issue doubly problematic at the moment, given that millions of Americans are struggling with lost jobs and income. Not only could they lose all or part of their stimulus checks, but they could also get locked out of their bank accounts.
   
 "We are hearing a lot of stories for people whose bank accounts are frozen" because of garnishment, Saunders says.
   
 The loophole has prompted 25 state attorneys general and Hawaii's Office of Consumer Protection to ask Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to ensure that debt collectors and creditors can't take Americans' stimulus checks.
   
 "During this public health and economic crisis, the States do not believe that the billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to help keep hard-working Americans afloat should be subject to garnishment," they said in a letter sent to Mnuchin on Monday.
   
 A Treasury official reportedly told banking officials last week that the law doesn't prohibit banks from taking the stimulus payments for delinquent loans or past-due fees, according to The American Prospect.
   
 A Treasury spokeswoman said the department is looking into the issue.
   
 Treasury has said that about 80 million Americans will receive their checks by the end of the week via direct deposit. The amount depends on your marital status, income and number of children under 17. For instance, individuals earning $75,000 or less will receive $1,200, while joint filers earning $150,000 or less will receive $2,400.
   
 People who earn above that will receive incrementally smaller checks until they phase out completely for single taxpayers with incomes over $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers with no children. Families with children under 17 will receive $500 per child.
   
 That can add up to a sizable chunk of money, with some families of four receiving as much as $3,400.
   
 Blocking debt collectors from grabbing that money has a simple fix, according to the attorneys general. Treasury could designate the stimulus checks as exempt from garnishments, including redefining the stimulus checks as "benefit payments" that would be off-limits to debt collectors.
   
 Not everyone is waiting for Treasury to act. Already, Massachusetts and Ohio have declared that their residents' stimulus checks can't be touched by debt collectors.
   
 "Significant numbers of people are suddenly finding themselves underemployed or unemployed and have lost wages," notes Lisa Stifler, director of state policy at the Center for Responsible Lending. The stimulus checks are "going to pay things like food and other necessities, so if creditors can seize that for old debts, that completely negates the purpose of these needed payments."
   
 Consumers who are concerned their accounts might get garnished could request a paper check through the IRS.gov's "Get My Payment" service, Saunders noted. They can then cash their check rather than depositing it.
   
 Saunders noted that others who have already received a direct deposit and are concerned about garnishment could withdraw the money from their accounts, although visiting an ATM or bank could pose health risks during the pandemic, she noted.
   
 "People are stuck between a rock and a hard place," she said.

Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D.      That's the mantra of Boston Marathon Race Director Dave McGillivray. Having already faced nearly every possible crisis in the event management business, Dave knows you need to have a back-up plan to your back-up plan in order to have something lined up for nearly every contingency. Yes, nearly every contingency.      Welcome to 2020's version of "never saw that coming!" and that's the coronavirus pandemic. But imaginable or not, it was the responsibility of Dave and the folks at the BAA to wrestle with a solution to this crisis that would be fair, safe and realistic. The current plan calls for "Boston in the Fall," which will be held on Sept. 14. The 124th edition was supposed to be held on April 20.      But the Boston Marathon wasn't the only event struggling with this crisis. The first to cancel was the Tokyo Marathon; then the Great Wall Marathon; Rome cancelled; London postponed to Oct. 4; Flying Pig postponed to Oct. 11; Paris postponed to Oct. 18; and Barcelona postponed to Oct. 25. By St. Patrick's Day virtually every local race was cancelled or was postponed as the "Stay at Home" advisories were issued, and now even the venerable Summer Olympics will be postponed for a year.      So, runners, just like Dave McGillivray, also had to develop a plan A, B, C and D.      For those planning to run a spring marathon, weeks of intensive training were already in the books, but the likelihood there will be a replacement event in the near future appears to be slim. Ongoing training is compromised with the closure of gyms and the social distancing limitations of coached workouts.      Realizing the full impact upon training regimens has led most runners to go through the five stages of "runner's grief."      First is denial. When the suggestion was made that there was a possibility of cancelling Boston and other running events, Facebook was filled with disbelief that this could even be considered, because after all isn't running a healthy activity?      Then, there's anger. The question was raised by many, on how dare race directors consider eliminating events after they put in months of preparation.      Bargaining and depression came next. The ban on these events must be for only international level events, right? Let's find a more local spring marathon. Surely, the Vermont City Marathon, for example, will be fine. Depressingly, all options began to disappear.      Here we are now at the acceptance stage, and with acceptance has come a realization of how fortunate runners are to have an outlet to help alleviate the stress of this crisis. Perhaps large group runs are off limits, but I see scores and scores of runners and walkers throughout the day either running alone or in small groups that are six-feet apart to adapt to the new norms that were created to slow down the spread of this virus.      As a fellow runner, I have found one of the blessings this current circumstance has gifted us is the opportunity to change the focus of our runs. Training is taking a backseat to mindful running.      For the time being, race pace is irrelevant. Weekly mileage is not critical. Now is a great time to fully immerse into the joys of running by opening up all our senses. Rather than concentrating on our smart watches that remind us how far, how fast and how many steps we've earned, we can now enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of spring.      My runs during these past few weeks have been a joy, as I explore new routes, while seeing so many folks who now have the time to go for a walk with spouses and children, and not worry about how fast they got it done.      This crisis we now face will end at some point. In the meantime, however, we have been granted a unique opportunity to de-stress, get outdoors and enjoy whatever the weather delivers, while recognizing the gift that a healthy lifestyle can give.   So, whether you are a finely tuned competitive runner, a modest racer, a novice jogger or a walker, get outside and enjoy this opportunity of guilt- free pleasure.   Stay well and wash your hands!

Indeed, Beijing is widely regarded as the single largest creditor to Africa. The Jubilee Debt Campaign—a coalition of organizations in the United Kingdom dedicated to debt relief for developing countries—has calculated that, as of 2018, around 20 percent of all African government debt is owed to China.

 Texas is unlike our nation's federal government in many ways, not the least of which is our balanced budget. But just because a budget is balanced doesn't mean it's fiscally responsible.
 With the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 crisis, and especially the steep decline in oil and gas production, Texas will be in for a tough budget cycle in 2021. However, if the Legislature chooses to lay politics and personal agendas aside, we can easily find areas to trim spending and make ends meet -- without cutting essential services.
 The most obvious step -- but perhaps the one taken the least seriously by appropriators -- is to cut frivolous, duplicative and just plain unnecessary programs.
 Even beyond the egregious, headline-grabbing incidents like state agencies shelling out thousands of taxpayer dollars for lavish conferences in Hawaii and six-figure-a-month office rent, there are widespread examples of wasteful spending through duplicative programs, multiple agencies handling similar issues, and unnecessary occupational licenses in industries that don't affect public health and safety.
 A great place to start would be the health care, trucking and licensing regulations temporarily waived by Gov. Greg Abbott's executive orders. If a rule isn't essential during a crisis, or is so burdensome as to interfere with Texans getting the services they need, there's a good chance it isn't essential under everyday circumstances, either.
 In fact, there are more than a few state agencies that could be eliminated altogether (perhaps with a few critical duties shuffled to another, more relevant entity) without the slightest impact on Texans' lives. The Legislature should use this opportunity to increase the rigor of our sunset review process and consider whether each agency's responsibilities are truly best handled at the state level, rather than the local level -- if at all.
 The Legislature should also closely review the litany of tax exemptions and loopholes that too often allow large corporations to benefit on the backs of ordinary Texans. For example, Chapter 312 and 313 abatements give substantial tax breaks to wind energy companies that often aren't even held to their minimum job creation requirements.
 Tax exemptions, particularly for inelastic property taxes, may be a small benefit to the recipient, but they increase the financial burden on the rest of us.
 Finally, the long-term solution to ensure Texas' budget doesn't needlessly inflate when the economy recovers is zero-based budgeting. Instead of assuming an arbitrary baseline level of funding, derived solely from how successfully appropriators were lobbied in the previous session, agencies should be required to justify each and every expense.
 This approach has helped Texas weather tough budget cycles before. In 2011, facing a $10 billion shortfall, legislators cut spending and balanced the budget without raising taxes by starting the budget from scratch. It's clear there is room to trim the fat, without increasing tax burdens, through careful, impartial analysis and zero-based budgeting.
 Texans are tough, and our independent spirit forged in 1836 is still going strong. Just as we tighten our belts when the going gets tough, so too should the Texas Legislature treat our tax dollars with restraint and respect in this trying time.

The one number that I have taken most comfort in today has been the demand business in our residential. And as I said earlier, that was down a little bit month to-date, but still reasonably solid, now all things considering. And that gives me comfort that when people's air conditioning breaks, they need to get it fixed, they need to get it addressed, they're at home and it's still flowing. And the other thing that we keep track of is that we're happy that we're in the central business. And so our dealers are working across the country and they're up and running and they're going out taking care of their homeowner customers. And so as long as all that's in place, then that's a good sign that we look at. But the way I think about this is we measured twice and then we cut once. So we measured 20% down, we cut.

Shoreline areas are currently under yet another flood watch because of high winds expected Tuesday.
 Weather forecasts call for wind speeds between moderate and strong from the southwest overnight and the northwest during the day.
 “Winds are predicted to shift around to the south and then to the southwest late (Monday) evening or overnight. These southwest winds are predicted to rise above 30 kilometres per hour at times with gusts over 50 km/h,” the Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority stated in a release.
 “As we move into (Tuesday) morning, winds are predicted to shift to the northwest. Winds are predicted to remain between 30 and 40 km/h for most of the day and into the evening. We could also see wind gusts between 50 and 65 km/h with these winds.”
 Waves of one to 1.5 metres are predicted on Lake Erie and 0.5 to one metre on Lake St. Clair during times of peak winds. Long-range forecasts are not showing any other events of concern until the weekend, officials added.
 “Overnight, when winds are from the south and southwest, winds will be driving waves onto our Lake Erie shoreline throughout Chatham-Kent and Elgin County,” the conservaion authority stated. “Due to high lake levels, there is a risk that wave action could damage shoreline protection works and cause erosion all along the shoreline, including along the high bluff areas. Flooding is likely along Erie Shore Drive in Chatham-Kent given the predicted wind speeds and direction.”
 Throughout Tuesday, when winds are out of the northwest, there could be impacts on Lake St. Clair. Winds will be pushing water into the southeast corner of the lake around Lighthouse Cove, which could raise water levels in the area and cause water to spill out of the canals causing flooding.
 The winds will also be driving waves onto the shoreline, which could cause flooding from wave spray and overtopping of shoreline protection works.
 There is a risk that wave action could damage shoreline protection works and cause erosion along the Lake St. Clair shoreline around Lighthouse Cove and nearby areas in Chatham-Kent. Residents in the affected areas should pay attention to conditions and be prepared.

 Louisiana is still recording dozens of deaths from the coronavirus every day, but there are some encouraging signs, like dropping hospitalization rates. As Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and other leaders plan for the moment when they can reopen their economies, they may rely on a vast new army of contact tracers to squash future outbreaks. Louisiana hasn't announced its plans, but public health experts say that up to 100,000 contact tracers could be needed nationwide to guard against COVID-19.
   
 While far more attention has been paid thus far to the lack of widespread and timely testing, epidemiologists say tests should be complemented by contact tracing to keep future coronavirus sparks from turning into forest fires.
   
 "We're going to need a whole giant cadre of people," said Gavin Yamey, a global health professor at Duke University. "If we take our foot off the gas, and we don't have really great ability to test people to get a rapid result to isolate people, and to do contact tracing, this thing is going to come back with a vengeance."
   
 Contact tracing is laborious, time-consuming work. Tracers interview infected people to come up with a list of everyone they've interacted with when they were infectious, attempting to gather details like how long they were in contact and how closely.
   
 In Louisiana, contact tracing has been used in recent years to stem the spread of infections like syphilis. Health officials track down the sexual partners of patients with syphilis and urge them to seek treatment.
   
 With coronavirus, the key next step is urging people who have come into contact with carriers to self-quarantine or seek medical help if needed, said Josh Michaud, an associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
   
 "It's something that public health departments have been using for over 100 years," he said. "The idea behind it is if you can identify most or all of the people who have a particular disease, then you can remove those people from circulation and prevent them from continuing the transmission chain."
   
 The peculiar qualities that have made the novel coronavirus so contagious also make it harder to trace, however. Infected people can spread the disease even before they begin to exhibit symptoms, giving them days to pass on the virus without knowing it.
   
 South Korea and Singapore have used high-tech tools like cell phone data and surveillance footage to aid contact tracers and effectively nip the coronavirus in the bud.
   
 But Louisiana, like many other states, appears to have been caught so off guard that contact tracing quickly became ineffective.
   
 The state attempted wholesale contact tracing for "a couple weeks" after the first coronavirus case was confirmed on March 9, said Susanne Straif- Bourgeois, an assistant professor at LSU Health Sciences Center New Orleans who spent years as the assistant state epidemiologist.
   
 "They were very busy, because basically at that point for every case which was confirmed you have to go 14 days back and see how they potentially exposed other people," she said. "That's a long time, and at that point everything was more or less 'normal,' so potentially a lot of people could've been exposed to that infected person."
   
 By the end of March, the coronavirus was so widespread in New Orleans that officials had narrowed their contact tracing in the metro area to focus on vulnerable populations. The state was right to switch tactics then, Straif- Bourgeois said. The problem at that point was so big that only a blunt tool like a stay-home order would work.
   
 "Contact tracing is especially effective early on in an epidemic when there aren't that many cases and you can feel confident that you've identified most of the cases," Michaud said. But when the case count is growing exponentially, contact tracers will only be able to stop a "sliver" of the transmission chains, he added.
   
 Nevertheless, the Louisiana Department of Health said it is investigating individual cases and conducting contact tracing everywhere outside the greater New Orleans area.
   
 The state has about 30 infectious disease epidemiologists. About 75 additional Louisiana Department of Health employees, including public health nurses and epidemiologists in other programs, have been re-directed to case investigation and contact tracing, according to Aly Neel, a department spokeswoman.
   
 In the future, the state Department of Health said it plans to adapt its contact tracing tactics as the coronavirus curve -- hopefully -- continues to flatten.
   
 "We are looking at the role of both the state and private sectors working in partnership to expand our contact tracing capacity to the level needed to suppress the outbreak going forward," Neel said.
   
 Rebekah Gee, a former health secretary under Gov. Edwards, said medical students and other volunteers might be able to help.
   
 "The Louisiana Public Health Department has some really dedicated people in it -- but there are way too few of them, particularly in infectious disease," said Susan Hassig, an epidemiology professor at Tulane University. "They've been working really hard but it's like trying to swim up Niagara Falls."
   
 Other states are relying on volunteers, retrained government employees and fresh hires to do contact tracing. Massachusetts is teaming up with the non- profit Partners in Health, which is better known for its work in Haiti, to hire 1,000 contact tracers. Utah is retraining hundreds of state workers.
   
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also planning to bulk up its corps of contact tracers, although the agency hasn't given specifics yet. Meanwhile, tech giants like Apple and Google are teaming up to develop an app with the aim of warning users when they've come into contact with infected people, though they are trying to do so while still protecting privacy.
   
 In an April 10 report, officials at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Association of State and Territorial Health Officials urged the federal government to direct hiring through the local health departments that are already on the front line fighting against coronavirus.
   
 Many state and local public health departments saw cuts during the last economic downturn, according to the report. The officials urged the federal government to dedicate $3.6 billion for states to hire 100,000 contact tracers at $17 an hour.
   
 "This is a win-win," said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "People need work, and this is work we can train people up for pretty quickly where they can be employed again."

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Five weeks after giving California Gov. Gavin Newsom broad power to spend up to $1 billion on coronavirus precautions, state lawmakers on Monday said they feared overreach by the governor's office and sought more answers on a contract to buy millions of protective masks. “The emergency powers that were granted were with an understanding that this would be for a certain amount of discreet time,” said Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting, chair of the budget oversight committee. There “definitely wasn’t the sense that there was a blank check or that we would just be notified after expenditures were already committed to.” His comments came during a budget oversight hearing on the money Newsom has already spent and his administration's prediction it will spend $7 billion or more tackling the pandemic. Lawmakers called for Newsom to work with the legislature before spending money on relief measures, citing language from the coronavirus bill passed last month that gave Newsom new spending authority. They passed the bill March 16 before suspending their legislative session. “It’s clear the administration is working with stakeholders but not with the legislature or the legislative staff,” said Jim Wood, a Democrat from Santa Rosa. “I have a health committee staff that has over a hundred years of health policy experience and we have not been engaged.” He said Newsom’s unilateral spending is a “bipartisan concern,” echoing the Republican vice chair of the budget oversight committee, Assemblyman Jay Obernolte, who questioned whether the governor’s broadened emergency spending powers included social safety net programs. State officials defended using part of the funds on food banks, homelessness and filling other gaps that federal funding did not address. “I feel like the...

Now that classrooms are closed for the rest of the school year because of the coronavirus, local educators face two huge challenges: how to deliver remote learning for another month, and how to avoid a crippling learning gap for thousands of students.
   
 Education leaders also say students and parents need to get used to the idea that traditional school routines are gone, maybe for good.
   
 "If the best solution is to have kids in a school building in mid-July, then we need to have them in mid-July," said Tony Davis, a member of the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.
   
 Gov. John Bel Edwards last week formally closed schools for the rest of the academic year as part of efforts to stem the spread of the virus.
   
 That means students will miss around nine weeks of traditional classroom time, from March 16 until the third week of May, when most schools finish the year.
   
 At least 40 of Louisiana's 69 school districts are offering some form of distance education, including videoconferencing, satellite learning, online chats or emails.
   
 But even affluent districts are having trouble reaching all their pupils, especially in a state where nearly half a million students live in low-income households.
   
 In addition, only 69% of households have internet access, a huge stumbling block in any push to deliver online and other instruction.
   
 Doris Voitier, superintendent of the St. Bernard Parish School District, said while her district is offering Google Classroom, Zoom and other forms of distance learning, 80% of her students are economically disadvantaged.
   
 Many of them are relying on paper-based materials, with teachers checking on students via telephone, email and screenshots.
   
 "This only intensifies the long-term need for the technological infrastructure that we need in the state of Louisiana," said Voitier, a 46-year educator and one of the governor's three appointees on BESE.
   
 Mike Faulk, executive director of the Louisiana Association of School Superintendents, said school leaders are grappling with a wide range of challenges trying to deliver instruction for another four weeks.
   
 'I am finding that even with larger districts there are some areas that do not have broadband capability, internet access, Wi-Fi," Faulk said.
   
 He said some school districts have delivered materials to students and others have set up times for parents to pick up work sheets.
   
 Others installed Wi-Fi on school buses to assist students who lack connections.
   
 Leaders of the state Department of Education are offering guidance to local school leaders.
   
 But acting State Superintendent of Education Beth Scioneaux has made clear that local officials will have the final call on grade promotions, where students stand academically and whether wholesale summer school classes are needed.
   
 Adding to the scramble is the fact that everyone is learning on the fly.
   
 "This is so unprecedented, there is no research to point to, there are not best practices," said Stephen Pruitt, president of the Southern Regional Education Board, which is based in Atlanta.
   
 "Everyone went into triage mode when this hit," Pruitt said.
   
 School leaders say how students fared until schools were closed March 16 will play a big role in promotion decisions.
   
 Those who were struggling will have a chance to make up ground.
   
 Superintendents have raised the possibility of summer school for thousands of students to make up for lost weeks or starting the 2020-21 school year early.
   
 Carrie Monica, executive director of the advocacy group Stand for Children, said officials should consider summer school, an early start to the next school and abbreviated breaks in case of future disruptions.
   
 Monica also suggested literacy coaches in kindergarten through fifth grade to ensure students are reading on grade level, a longtime state challenge.
   
 Ashley Ellis, assistant principal of Neville High School in northeast Louisiana and the mother of three children, said the potential learning gap is real.
   
 "Even your middle of the road, average student is going to have a gap that could affect the ACT, could affect what college they get into," said Ellis, who is also a BESE member.
   
 "It is bigger than just at-risk students. It is all students. Missing nine weeks of the school year is a challenge."
   
 Allison Hughes, superintendent of the Red River Parish School District in north Louisiana, said she hopes to have students back in the classroom a week after Edwards gives the go ahead.
   
 "The biggest challenge is how do you recover instructional time," Hughes said.
   
 Her district is offering distance learning and Chromebooks for all students.
   
 But not all 1,400 children in the district have internet access.
   
 Packets of work materials, most subject review but some covering new topics, are sent to students' homes every two or three weeks and students have weekly contact with teachers.
   
 Wes Watts, superintendent of the West Baton Rouge Parish School District, said schools had gathered lots of data when classes were shuttered.
   
 "We will have ways to know which students need to remediate this summer," Watts said.
   
 Davis, the BESE member who lives in Natchitoches, said he has told superintendents in his district that there is nothing to keep students from returning to classes before the traditional August start dates.
   
 "We cannot assume that we are going to move forward with the way things used to be," he said.
   
 "The most educated and most affluent, nuclear families … those kids are not getting the education they would in a classroom with a good teacher."
   
 Pruitt made the same point.
   
 "When we open this back up there is going to have to be a recognition that this is not business as usual," he said. "What you have done in August and September in the past will not be applicable."

Cilley, through playful vocabulary terms and acronyms, created an ingenious system to keep followers motivated until tasks like dusting become second nature. It all starts with the _FlyLady 's e-mail group_, which sends out daily emails (on average 10) to help guide you through your day. Subscribing to the email list is completely free. Each day, FlyBabies, as they're called, get a daily flight plan (among other things) delivered to their inboxes. This plan advises them on what area to focus on each day, and sets up their weekly cleaning and errand schedule. But it's not all chores: The plan might also include a "weekly pampering mission" or "habit of the month" to practice. Cilley wants her FLY (Finally Loving Yourself) program to help individuals in all aspects of life. In fact, time for family and "date night" is also implemented into a FLY weekly routine.
 Newcomers to FlyLady's system will first be introduced to Cilley's _31 BabySteps_. Developing routines "is the result of tiny changes over several months," she says, which is why she wants newcomers to start their trek into the FLY program with these BabySteps, or small daily tasks, like shining the sink. As users get more familiar with the system, they'll learn how to create a control journal and weekly routines that work for them. They'll also learn how to clean their house using the FlyLady's famous zone system. This method divides the home into five different zones. Each week, followers will work in a different zone for 15 minutes a day on a certain task because, as the FlyLady says, "anyone can do anything for 15 minutes." The zones repeat monthly.

When you look at the quarterback prospects for the 2020 NFL Draft names like Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Just Herbert and Jordan Love are the ones that come to mind right off the bat. Like most drafts, however, there are some late-round gems to be had and this year it could be Florida International's James Morgan. Mike Giardi of the NFL Network reported on Monday that Morgan is getting some late love from teams as the draft is just days away. Of the teams that are interested in Morgan, Giardi relays that his release is what has scouts fawning over him and one even noted that "the ball is like a rocket out of his hand." Another scout, however, noted that his decision-making is "suspect."
 Morgan isn't viewed as a Week 1, plug-and-play prospect like some of his 2020 classmates like Burrow or Tagovailoa. Instead, he's more of a developmental piece and is likely to come off the board on Day 3 of the draft. In his seven- round mock draft, CBS Sports' R.J. White has Morgan landing with the New Orleans Saints, which does make some sense as he would have the ability to sit behind Drew Brees and further develop his skills without the pressure of starting out of the gate. Teams like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or the Green Bay Packers (his hometown club) would also fit that bill of a team that has an established -- but aging -- quarterback under center possibly looking for an heir apparent in the years to come.
 One team that has reportedly expressed interest in Morgan to the points where they've held a videoconference meeting with him is the Patriots. New England, of course, is in the market for a quarterback to compete with second-year signal caller Jarrett Stidham and veteran Brian Hoyer after Tom Brady departed for Tampa Bay in free agency.
 Morgan started his collegiate career at Bowling Green State, but eventually found his way to Florida International for his junior and senior seasons. His junior campaign was far more efficient than his final year at FIU. In 2018, Morgan completed 65.3% of his passes for 2,727 yards, 26 touchdowns and just seven interceptions. In his senior year, Morgan's completion percentage dropped to 58% and passed for 2,585 yards, 14 touchdowns and threw five interceptions.

Looking at the business segment performance for the first quarter, there are a couple of over-arching comments to make. First, weather continued to have a significant adverse impact.

Second, we saw an increasing impact on our business in March from the COVID-19 pandemic, first, in Europe and then in North America. On the demand side, we saw contractors stocking-up less residential equipment ahead of the spring and summer seasons due to the rising economic uncertainty and national account customers in both our Commercial and Refrigeration businesses have pushed orders out. Operationally, HVAC has been designated as an essential business in North America, Europe and in Mexico. We have managed the supply chain well across regions that we source from including Asia and combined with our buffer stock, we have not seen an impact on our manufacturing capability in this regard. In late March, we did make the decision to close some of our factories for a couple of weeks and broadly protected the Lennox team from COVID-19 cases at those locations. These factors are all back up and running and of course protection for the team members are in place.

Furthermore, the defense forced three turnovers and the Herd turned those into points as the team jumped out to a 30-3 lead before Houston started a mini- comeback attempt that fell short.
 While the game went down as a victory for the Herd that day, it sure seemed like a loss in the long run.
 In the short term from that game, it was the Herd’s last win of the 2008 season.
 In its following contest, the Herd special teams blew an extra point and a field goal in overtime that led to an enigmatic 19-16 overtime loss at East Carolina.
 A win there would have put Marshall at 5-3 overall and 4-1 in Conference USA, possibly being what the Herd needed to turn things around under Snyder.
 Instead, the Herd lost its final three games after that ECU debacle to end a promising campaign at 4-8.
 In the long-term of that game — now known as the ‘Band Cart’ game — Edwards sued Marshall and the sides settled out of court in 2012.
 Twelve years later, when asking people about that 2008 game against Houston, some may remember the win for Snyder, others may remember Marshall beating now-Houston head coach Dana Holgorsen, who was the offensive coordinator.
 But everyone remembers Patrick Edwards breaking his leg. Whether they were part of the 20,000-plus inside Joan C. Edwards Stadium or they watched it unfold on ESPN2, there’s not a Marshall fan out there that doesn’t remember that sight.
 Sometimes, a coach simply needs a few breaks to go his way for things to work out. When they don’t, the coach doesn’t work out, either.
 This particular break — well, Edwards’ break — certainly didn’t work out for Snyder or the Herd — even on one of the top nights of his tenure.

I read the by-laws and learned they specified when we were to do business meetings (Saturday nights), and we did them on Sundays. I asked the deacons if we shouldn’t change the by-laws, and they agreed.
 The update approved simply said “at a time decided by the congregation.”
 However, one of their spouses hit the ceiling. She angrily confronted me about the danger of “messing” with the by-laws.
 I made an appointment with our new home church pastor in Louisville to seek advice. He told me how some people zealously guarded the status quo and urged me to use an analogy.
 “A house is cherished and valuable, but we renovate it to bring it up-to- date,” he said. “This makes the home even more valuable.”

As coronavirus spreads rapidly through the Marion Correctional Institution, making the central Ohio prison apparently the nation's top hotspot for COVID-19, advocates for both corrections officers and inmates say the state is not doing enough to protect either.
   
 The union representing 349 guards and other employees at the Marion prison is concerned that corrections officers and others at the prison who had been sent home after testing positive for coronavirus are being forced back to work as soon as three days after being deemed symptom-free. Those same employees are often working double shifts as well, said Sally Meckling, spokeswoman for the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association.
   
 "County health departments and state health departments are all over the map on instructions about who goes back to work and when," Meckling said. "Some of our members are being told they can go back after three days of being symptom- free, others are saying five days and others are saying 14 days.
   
 "The other issue we've got, particularly at Marion, is (employees) who are back after being tested positive are working back-to-back shifts. They are already sick, they are tired, and now they are working 16 hours a day."
   
 Through Monday, 1,950 of about 2,500 prisoners at the Marion prison have tested positive for COVID-19, along with 154 staff members, about a third of the prison's work force. One guard, John Dawson of Mansfield, Ohio, has died, as has one inmate. Another 34 prisoners have been hospitalized.
   
 The Marion prison is now by far the nation's top hot spot for the coronavirus, a compilation by the New York Times shows. Because of the prison spike, Marion County's overall infection rate of 3,172 per 100,000 residents also is the highest in the country.
   
 The Marion totals are inflated because tests were administered widely in the prison, while testing is much less widespread across the country.
   
 Ohio's prison coronavirus outbreak is being closely monitored by federal authorities, Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Sunday on CBS' "Face The Nation."
   
 The best way to stop the spread of the disease inside the prison is to release more non-violent offenders, said Holly Harris, executive director of the Justice Action Network, a bipartisan group that advocates for criminal justice reform.
   
 Gov. Mike DeWine needs to "work faster and do more. Identify more incarcerated people who are not a public safety threat who can go to home confinement or be furloughed or whatever the mechanism you can use, use it to get these people out of these death chambers," Harris said.
   
 DeWine announced last week that he will seek the early release of 167 inmates, most of whom are serving time in minimum-security prisons throughout the state.
   
 "We do not intend to have a wholesale - everybody in certain category comes out. We are trying to do this very thoughtfully, at the same time doing everything we can to protect the prisoners and the employees who work there," DeWine said. "But prisons present, as Dr. (Amy) Acton has said, a very difficult situation."
   
 Inmates are not receiving proper medical care, says Austin Cooper, who has served over half of his six-year sentence for aggravated burglary and assault convictions and is one of the Marion prisoners who tested positive over the weekend for COVID-19.
   
 He said he has been suffering from symptoms for about two weeks, including migraines and cold chills, but was never isolated from the other inmates at the prison camp where he lives.
   
 "As recently as yesterday, we have inmates in here that can't even walk and breathe" because of the virus, he said. "Medical just keeps sending them back out here to the camp, talking about they can't do nothing for them."
   
 Cooper said one inmate in the camp complained of symptoms for five days before his condition worsened and he was rushed out of the prison by ambulance.
   
 "He almost died out here," he said. "We're just stuck in here. ... Honestly, they almost have to be dead before medical will even do anything for them."
   
 JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the prisons agency, said numerous steps have been taken to slow the spread of coronavirus inside Ohio prisons, including mass testing at Marion, the Pickaway Correctional Institution in Circleville and the Franklin Medical Center in Columbus.
   
 In Marion, "Individuals who test positive are placed in an area of the facility which is separate from the general population. Also, our comprehensive testing approach of staff and inmates has assisted us in identifying asymptomatic individuals who have tested positive who can now be isolated in order to prevent further spread," Smith said.
   
 The National Guard is building structures at some prisons to house and spread out prisoners and lessen the chances of COVID-19 spreading, DeWine said
