Unless “something drastic” happens during the next two days before Robert Morris visits Sacred Heart, the Atlantic Hockey quarterfinals will go on as scheduled and spectators will be allowed to attend. The National Collegiate Hockey Conference, which includes Colorado College, hasn’t announced any fan- related changes.
 Last weekend AHA commissioner Robert M. DeGregorio Jr. and Waters discussed what would happen if the league playoff champion couldn’t be determined the usual way. Waters believes it’s in Atlantic Hockey’s bylaws that if the tournament can’t be held, the regular-season champion would assume the league’s NCAA Tournament bid. This year, that would be AIC.
 With RPI men’s hockey hosting an ECAC Hockey tournament quarterfinal against Harvard with no fans in attendance, and the Ivy League canceling its men’s and women’s basketball championship tournaments, those hypotheticals have become more solid.
 The Ivy League’s solution is unfair to those teams hoping to play their way into a tournament, including Air Force hockey, but bigger forces are at work.
 “We want to make sure everyone’s safe,” Waters said.
 Atlantic Hockey tournament host sites have been spared so far, but coronavirus is nearby. West Point, which hosts Niagara this weekend, is an hour away from New Rochelle. Much of the New York suburb will be shut down for two weeks as the state battles a cluster of coronavirus cases.
 The Atlantic Hockey final four is set for March 20-21 in Buffalo, N.Y., which has yet to confirm a case.
 The league hasn’t yet finalized a contingency plan, but all options are being discussed as plans are “changing by the minute.” The state where the league is headquartered, Massachusetts, saw its governor declare a state of emergency as confirmed cases more than doubled to 92.
 Options discussed include moving the series to a neutral location if there’s an outbreak in the area, or doing what RPI has done and playing in front of empty stands.
 “People are feeling it on all levels ... but in the same breath, it’s playoff hockey,” Waters said. “It’s supposed to be the most exciting part of our season. We’re going to do everything we can to make sure our playoffs go off as we anticipate them to.”
 Back at home, schools are making their own calls.
 Colorado College announced that Block 7 classes will be delivered via distance learning and spring break, which begins Thursday, has been extended. “Students should plan to remain off campus from spring break through at least the end of Block 7, and possibly the rest of the academic year,” according to the school website.

The Madhya Pradesh (MP) government will send more ministers to Bengaluru on Thursday to persuade the 19 Congress Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), said to be loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia, to return to the party fold, a day after the party high command entrusted the job of wooing back the legislators to newly appointed Karnataka Congress chief D K Shivakumar, the party leaders said. Three more MLAs have also resigned but aren't in Bengaluru. Two ministers in Kamal Nath cabinet, Sajjan Singh Verma and Gobind Singh, claimed to have held talks with the MLAs in Bengaluru with the help of Shivakumar. "The MLAs told us that they have been misled and have said that they would remain with the Congress," Verma said, after returning to Bhopal in the evening.Their claim was quickly rebutted through a video message by women and child development minister Imarti Devi, who reaffirmed her loyalty to Scindia, who joined the BJP on Wednesday, and said she will always stand alongside him "even if I had to jump into a well".Devi said she and other rebel Congress MLAs are camping in Bengaluru out of their own volition and with the blessings of Scindia and there was no possibility of returning to the Congress. Another minister and Scindia loyalist, Tulsi Silavat, also released a similar video statement on behalf of all rebel MLAs.The Congress leaders, on condition of anonymity, in Bhopal, said a decision was taken to send more ministers to Bengaluru after Verma and Singh raised the possibility of at-least 10 legislators being willing to returning to the party. Congress leader and former MP CM, Digvijaya Singh, said 13 of the 22 party MLAs were not willing to quit the party despite Scindia joining the BJP. "They don't want a re-election," he said.A Congress leader, who was not willing to be named, said the 10 first time MLAs in the group of 22 and some other legislators can return to the party fold . "We know well that most of MLAs would not jeopardise their political career, particularly the first-timers in the state assembly, by joining the BJP. Also, they will not like to face election again within 14 months of winning one," the leader said. A second Congress leader, who too was not willing to be named, said the BJP's plan to take 19 MLAs to Bengaluru is proving to be a bit difficult to deal with as getting access to them is a problem. He added that Nath was sending other ministers, close to the MLAs, to woo them back. A third Congress leader privy to the discussions in the party said there was unanimity that speaker NP Prajapati, who is originally from the Congress, should not take any action on the resignation of 22 legislators and insist on the legislators returning to Bhopal. "Buying time would frustrate the legislators and they would come back to the party," the leader said.He said there was no possibility of the six ministers, who are in Bengaluru, ditching Jyotiraditya Scindia and come back to the Congress. That is the reason Nath had requested Governor Lalji Tandon to remove them from the Cabinet on Monday, he said. Meanwhile, senior MP BJP leaders including former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Narottam Mishra held discussions on the same issue and decided to send some senior party functionaries to Bengaluru to prevent the Congress ministers from meeting the legislators. Already, three party leaders are in the city, BJP leaders said. The BJP had also made elaborate arrangements for welcoming Jyotiraditya Scindia in Bhopal on Thursday.

"We are guarding them and additional police force has also been deployed on request of the MLAs from MP," he said.Political analyst Girija Shankar said, "What the Congress leaders are doing today to change the situation in their favour they should have done it months back."

She finds such spirit and soul in the music of that time period that it inspires her. Despite that, she'll get into something completely different every few months, which ultimately leads to a little piece of that music will infiltrate her psyche and become yet another thing that influences her.
 What ultimately brought her to having her "aha moment" in music? Road tripping to the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado. When she left school, she would work, save up money and go on big road trips for months at a time, road tripping with her guitar. When she was driving through the mountains after the festival, "it" hit her.
 When Miss Tess first visited Charlottesville, she busked on the Downtown Mall ahead of her performance. She did this ahead of a few performances in town to get people hyped up for the show.
 "I've always liked outdoor spaces where people can walk around and experience life in the city center," she said.
 When she's on tour with her band, there isn't much time to explore the cities and towns they play in. In Charlottesville's case, Miss Tess enjoys visiting because she can see some of her friends, like the members of Love Canon and David Wax Museum.
 "It's cool sometimes to go to a town [to see] friends you haven't seen in a while. It's nice."
 Festival season is another opportunity for artists to hang out with friends they might not see when they're out touring. It's also the time to relax and have fun amidst tour schedules that take them across the country. Looking ahead to the summer months gives musicians some hope. Especially when they're tired of winter, like she is.
 "We travel so much that it’s hard to catch music from friends sometimes," she said. "It's great when a bunch of people are together having a good time outside and listening to good music."
 Festivals also give artists the opportunity to have some fun, with backstage jams and special collaborative projects that come to fruition at festivals.
 Sometimes, collaborative projects don't happen at festivals. Sometimes it's happenstance. That's what brought Miss Tess together with Lake Street Dive's Rachael Price.
 "We actually lived together! It was the response of a Craigslist ad. I met her the day that I moved to Boston," she said.
 Miss Tess attended Berklee for a few semesters, but didn't realize what an amazing singer Price was until they moved in together.

The rain finally slowed down, but not South Effingham's baseball team.
   
 Rain or shine, the youthful Mustangs need playing time, says their coach Todd Eubanks.
   
 "We're happy to be on the ball field," Eubanks said. "It flooded here (March 4 and 5) and luckily the field held up and we were able to play some more baseball."
   
 The results added more joy. SEHS breezed past overmatched Liberty County 16-1 on Friday and, earlier in the week -- March 2 -- topped Brunswick 5-3 to extend its winning streak to seven games.
   
 The Mustangs (9-2) are off to their best start since going 11-1 to begin the 2015 season, according to Internet site MaxPreps.
   
 Three inches of rain over a two-day span kept the Mustangs in the batting cage. Sun, wind and some hard work got the field in playing shape Friday.
   
 Despite getting only four innings in against Liberty County because of the 15-run mercy rule, the competition was needed. Particularly when you have only three seniors on the squad. Eubanks started three freshmen on Friday. The trio -- Kaleb Johnson, Zach Zorbo and Aaron Benton -- combined to reach base six times in eight official at bats and drove in five runs.
   
 Junior Phillip Cooper had two hits with four RBIs.
   
 Senior right hander Hunter Morgan won his fourth game. He pitched three innings, scattering three hits and allowing just one unearned run.
   
 Against Brunswick, sophomore right hander Nick Milbrandt went 5.1 innings. He didn't have his best stuff but battled to keep the Pirates off the scoreboard after surrendering two runs in the first inning.
   
 Nick Duke pitched a scoreless seventh inning for his second save in three games.
   
 Milbrandt had two RBIs and Zorbo added three hits.
   
 "We're getting better, that's the main thing," Eubanks said. "Our young kids are playing well. Things are coming together. What's happening is what should be happening."
   
 ECHS posts DH sweep of Evans
   
 The Rebels received a much-needed confidence builder with a 3-2, 10-0 doubleheader sweep of Evans High on Friday.
   
 ECHS snapped a four-game losing streak and avenged an 8-2 loss to Evans a week earlier.
   
 In Game 1, Merritt Evans and Garrett Miller split the pitching and combined on a three-hitter.
   
 The next game may have been more encouraging. Right hander Josh Bassett had his best outing, scattering three hits over five shutout innings.
   
 "Last year, from the first game, it was easy to write the lineup," said ECHS coach Chris Johnson, who depended on a deep and talented senior class in 2019 to advance to the Final Four at state. "This year, we're still trying to establish what the lineup is going to be."
   
 Johnson hopes Friday was the turning point. A move paying immediate dividends was the addition of freshman Blake Hendrix, who had four hits on the day in his first games on varsity.
   
 Hendrix, a shortstop, had three hits and drove in two runs in the nightcap. Zack Garcia and Kaden Stone also had two RBIs in the second game.
   
 Dustin Johnson's sacrifice fly in the sixth inning of Game 1 gave the Rebels a 3-1 lead and provided the margin of victory.
   
 In Game 2, freshman Blake Hendrix had three hits and drove in two runs.
   
 "This week, you could see the difference in the kids even though we were indoors a lot" because of rain, Chris Johnson said. "You could see things coming together."
   
 The Rebels (4-7) opened a three-game series with Statesboro on March 9. Game 2 is today in Springfield at 6 p.m. with the third game in Statesboro on Friday at 6.

Officials in Mississippi have scrambled to edit a public service announcement about the 2020 U.S. Census that led viewers to an incorrect website. The Census Bureau notified Mississippi officials on Monday with their concerns that the ad could confuse people on what they should expect in the mail. In the 30-second spot, actor Morgan Freeman holds a postcard with a QR code. \"It's one of the most important things you'll ever find in your mailbox,\" he says, before urging residents to fill out their census forms so Mississippi can unlock federal funds that are dispersed based on census results. Starting this week, the U.S. Census Bureau is mailing out initial notices inviting people to participate in the census. The notices aren't post cards, though; they are blue, letter-length papers with ID numbers printed in a box and the signature of Census Bureau director Steven Dillingham. And they don't feature QR codes, images that can be scanned with a smart phone to take someone to a website. Postcards will be sent out later this month to remind people to fill out the form, but those won't have QR codes either. Mississippi officials say the mistake was an honest one and that the ad has been edited to make the QR code unreadable. “There was a good-faith effort to have Morgan Freeman, a trusted voice, say the census is important, and that shouldn't get lost in the story,\" said John Green, vice chairman of the Mississippi Complete Count Committee, which is leading census outreach efforts in the state. The spot was produced by The Focus Group, a Mississippi-based marketing and advertising firm. It began running online and on TV earlier this month.

As the number of coronavirus cases rise in Louisiana amid what the World Health Organization now considers a global pandemic of the virus, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that education officials should "prepare for the possibility of community-level outbreaks" within public and private K-12 schools and daycares.
 As of Wednesday, no K-12 public or private schools in the 7-parish area, including Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, St. Tammany or Plaquemines parishes, had reported a student or teacher who had tested positive for COVID-19.
 But as schools in other major cities like Seattle and San Francisco shut their doors because of outbreaks, New Orleans educators briefed City Council members on Tuesday about public school closures in light of the coronavirus and how students might learn in spite of them, in one of the most comprehensive updates so far on school preparations.

 Other districts in the 7-parish region said distance learning would be extremely difficult, because of lack of access to internet. Officials in St. John the Baptist Parish, for instance, said there were currently no plans for teaching remotely.
 Ted Beasley, the spokesman for Jefferson Parish Public Schools, said that while the intent there was to keep schools open, if possible, the district was looking at the possibility of remote learning plans. However, officials would have to include some kind of "paper-based component" because so many students in the district don't have access to internet.
 "We do have on-demand, self-paced, e-learning options available for families and are having internal discussions around how to serve as many families as possible should the need arrive," Beasley said in an email. "Our rough internal estimate is that about half of our families do not have home internet services or the technological devices needed to receive our services."
 As has been the case, local districts and schools said they were implementing precautionary practices, including deep-cleaning and self-quarantining, in the case of travel to a country deemed at high risk by the CDC.
 In the meantime, local parents said they were scrambling to prepare for possible closures. Many worried about stocking up on food, coming up with plans for working remotely and figuring out how to keep teaching their kids, should schools close.
 "My only concern is how they'll make up for the time lost," said Tatyana Meshcheryakova, a parent of two children at Morris Jeff Community School. "My high schooler gets a lot of work processed remotely already, through an online system...but I can't see the third grader doing the same, apart from working on paper packets."
 Noelle Forstall LaRosa, who has two children in Catholic schools and two in the Jefferson Parish School System, said she was fortunate in that she could work from home, but had a hard time envisioning what that would look like with her kids.
 "My biggest concern is being prepared for a quarantine if necessary," LaRosa said. "I haven’t made it to the store yet! And my sanity if I do have to stay home!"

But the only ones that have cameras and flashing beacons are Canisius High on Delaware Avenue and the Makowski Early Childhood Center on Jefferson Avenue.
 As parts of the program have gotten the green light, there are questions about when other schools could go live. For instance, how accurate are the cameras?
 As the speed zones outside Canisius High and the Makowski School went into effect, city officials say drivers have been taking notice.
 "We are seeing speeding pass those two school locations where cameras are operational, where flashing beacons are operational, go way down," said Mayor Byron Brown.
 We saw a lot of people slowing down. But occasionally, we saw some drivers who probably will get a $50 ticket in the mail.
 Mayor Brown's Administration has said all along, this is not about taking more of your money.
 "This is about the safety of children going to school in the City of Buffalo," Brown said.
 It appears that enforcement during the entire school day will remain.
 "We believe if the cameras are not operational the entire day, people will not build up the habit of slowing down when they drive pass our schools," Brown said.
 There are 10 school speed zones, and as we've reported, only two of them are in effect.
 The other eight have cameras that are taking pictures of speeding drivers, but you won't get a ticket until the beacons there have not been turned on.
 "We're just doing our final checks to make sure that operationally the cameras the beacons everything is the way we want it and we will be announcing as the mayor said on a rolling basis," said Kevin Helfer, Buffalo's parking commissioner.

David Lilienthal might not be a household name now, but the 1916 graduate of Michigan City’s Elston High School was head of two powerful federal agencies the 1930s and 1940s.
 Lilienthal was born July 8, 1899, in Morton, Illinois. He was principally raised in Michigan City and Valparaiso.
 After serving as a member of the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, he was appointed to the three-person board overseeing the Tennessee Valley Authority. The TVA was established during the Great Depression so the federal government could distribute hydroelectric power to rural areas not served by private utilities.
 In 1946, U.S. Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson asked Lilienthal to chair a five-member group that would advise President Harry Truman and Secretary of State James Byrns on the dangers of nuclear weapons.
 The 60-page Report on the International Control of Atomic Energy, known as the Acheson-Lilienthal Report, issued in March 1946 proposed that the United States turn over its monopoly on nuclear weapons to an international agency in exchange for strict inspections and control of bomb ingredients.
 The U.S. formed the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission to provide civilian control. Lilienthal was appointed chairman of the new agency in 1946 and served until Feb. 15, 1950. He put high priority on developing peaceful uses, including nuclear power plants.
 Lilienthal died on Jan. 16, 1981.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday released the names of 11 candidates, including two from the allies, the Republican Party of India (Athawale), or RPI(A), and the Bodoland People's Front, who will be the party's nominees for the March 26 Rajya Sabha (RS) biennial elections. Former Congress leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia, who joined the BJP hours before the announcement, and Bhubaneswar Kalita, who resigned from the party on August 5, the day the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill was tabled in the RS, are among the party's 11 nominees for the Upper House polls.
 Besides Scindia, the BJP's other nominee from Madhya Pradesh is likely to be Harsh Chouhan, a senior member of the RSS-affiliated Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) alumnus, who is known for his work in the water conservation sector.
 Chouhan's appointment is yet to be officially announced.
 The BJP is eyeing 12 of the 55 seats that will go to polls.
 For the two seats in Assam, it has nominated Kalita and Biswajit Daimary of the Bodoland People's Front, who has been a two-time RS MP.
 Vivek Thakur, the son of former Union Minister CP Thakur, has been announced as the party's choice from Bihar, where the BJP ally JD(U) will get two seats.
 The total number of seats falling vacant in Bihar next month is five.
 Abhay Bhardwaj, a Rajkot-based lawyer, who had defended the accused in the Gulberg Society massacre of the 2002 Gujarat riots, and Ramilaben Bara will be the candidates from Gujarat.
 From Maharashtra, Ramdas Athawale from the RPI-A, an ally of the BJP, has been nominated along with Udyan Raje Bhonsle, a former Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member of Parliament (MP), who lost the Satara Lok Sabha bypoll and is a descendant of the 17th century Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji.
 Also on the list of candidates are Deepak Prakash, the BJP's Jharkhand unit chief, Lisemba Maharaj from Manipur and Rajendra Gehlot, Rajasthan unit's vice-president and a former state minister.

The inaugural New Orleans Book Festival at Tulane University, scheduled for next week, has been canceled amid the spread of the new coronavirus, organizers of the event said Wednesday.
 In an e-mail, event co-chairs Cheryl Landrieu and Walter Isaacson said that it was important to call off the festival, which was set to bring in local, regional and national authors to New Orleans from March 19 to 21, due to the public health concerns of holding such a large gathering.
 "We of course must do what is best for the health and safety of our community and our nation," the email said, noting that they have already scheduled the 2021 festival.
 The festival was set to showcase nearly 100 authors. Organizers were planning for roughly 30,000 attendees over the three day event.
 The cancellation comes amid a growing list of events that organizers have elected to call off in light of the spread of COVID-19. On Tuesday, Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced that Wednesday at the Square, the Downtown St. Patrick's Day parade, Irish Channel St. Patrick's Day parade, the Italian American parade, the Single Men Social Aid and Pleasure Club second line and Uptown's Super Sunday event were cancelled.

The decision to move March Madness behind closed doors represents a new frontier of sorts for American sports, which have never seen an event of this size and scope take place without fans present.

 “And right now we’re just trying to bounce back and be the most aggressive team we can be.”
 The Wildcats can count on Nnaji to be part of that. The 6-foot-11-inch forward/center won the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year award on Monday after leading the Wildcats in scoring (16.1) and rebounds (9.2) while shooting 50.3% from the field in conference games this season.

 The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak is escalating.
 Yesterday, (March 10) Gov. Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency in Massachusetts after the number of presumptive cases of coronavirus jumped to 92, more than double the number confirmed on Monday.
 Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the outbreak a pandemic, with the number of confirmed cases topping 121,000 and 4,300 deaths globally.
 Across the U.S., there have been more than 1,000 cases confirmed, 31 have died, and COVID-19 has spread to 38 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
 The state of emergency in Massachusetts has prompted many colleges and universities to cancel classes on campus and go to online learning for the rest of the semester; some are asking students to move out of the dormitories after spring break.
 The coronavirus outbreak is also having an impact on local sporting and other events drawing large crowds. On Monday, March 9, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced the cancellation of the St. Patrick's Day Parade, Worcester followed suit yesterday, and today the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) said it will postpone some high school playoff basketball games due to COVID-19.

THE sight of a full carpark is enough for our region’s sheep producers to grow cautiously optimistic as saleyards hold condition and prices inch back to normal.
 Before early 2020 rain, McDougall and Sons sheep agent Ross Ellis was worried about rural locations becoming ‘virtual ghost towns’ as breeding stock sold off in alarming numbers.
 Now, while drought was far from over, a return to a competitive middle range had left the agent feeling a ‘step of confidence’ in his stride.
 “Anything with a bit of condition is now being sought after by the processors and anything that isn’t in condition is being sought after by restockers,” he said.
 “Compared to last week, the top market eased off a fraction but the lighter end and middle-of-the-range lambs were very competitive.”
 The saleyards yarded a total of 1776 on Wednesday, a 30 per cent increase from last week, but unlike last year’s high yarding totals, prices were also increasing in tandem.
 Mr Ellis sold the highest priced ewe at $236, which went straight back into the paddock.
 “The vendors were very happy that’s the way it went,” he said.
 “A lot of people have held on and looked after their stock and are reaping the rewards and it’s a credit to those farmers.”
 One such farmer was Stuart Barkla.
 He made $242 on a ewe lamb at this week’s sale, and $257 the week prior.
 For the Clifton sheep producer, 2019 had almost driven him to the end of his tether.
 Only receiving 125mm of rain for the whole year, he spent 22 months feeding his 300 ewes, at $40 a head, plus hay incursions.
 “There has been enormous costs in feeding them and keeping them going,” he said.
 “When hay got so expensive, the question was raised whether we keep breeders going but we’ve been fortunate.”
 In the past five to six weeks, his property has received about 300mm, more than double his 2019 total, and a godsend.
 Mr Barkla, who had previously destocked completely on his Cunnamulla property in 2013, knew what it was like to be in the shoes of those who were forced to sell up.
 “I absolutely feel for those farmers,” he said.
 “Some people just quit their breeders prior to the rain and that’s just heartbreaking.
 “It’s been a very difficult period for everybody and it’s not over yet.”
 With stock now feeding on grass, Mr Barkla believed he could consolidate until well into winter but warned it could take years for the industry to get back on its feet.
 “It’s only a break for us, and certainly not drought-breaking by any means,” he said.
 “We still need rain to string together over two to three seasons. That’s the real challenge, from both breeding and trading stock, to generate cash flow again.”
 Mr Barkla’s predictions match the recent ABARES report, showing while saleyard lamb prices will remain at historically high levels over 2020 they will trend downwards during the next five years.
 Still, for exhausted farmers, any rest was welcome.
 “This isn’t over any stretch and there’s a lot of farmers that still haven’t had a great deal – out west and here,” Mr Barkla said.
 “The industry is still on tenterhooks but it’s a good start.”
