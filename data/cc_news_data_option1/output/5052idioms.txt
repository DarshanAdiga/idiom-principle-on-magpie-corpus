He stressed it was imperative for lawmakers to "finish the bipartisan work underway now or millions of Americans may wait months longer to get the vaccine."   Biden also pledged that his administration would carry out at least 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, a more conservative estimate than that offered by Trump officials.
 America's floundering efforts to quell the pandemic have been widely criticized - the nation is the world's worst-hit, with 15,151,472 cases and 286,117 deaths.   California ordered most offices to close and banned gatherings among different households.   Bars and services such as hair salons were shut, and restaurants were allowed to serve takeaway only. Non-essential travel was also temporarily restricted statewide as California experienced record new Covid-19 cases.
 "The overwhelming majority of Californians are now in this new stay-at-home order protocol," said Governor Gavin Newsom, who earlier warned that the state hospital system risked being "overwhelmed."   The US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said data from trials of Pfizer-BioNTech drug revealed "no specific safety concerns."   The data "suggest a favourable safety profile, with no specific safety concerns identified" that would preclude issuing an authorization for emergency use, it said.
 The FDA is also expected to green light the Moderna vaccine.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Pfizer and BioNTech will deliver their first doses to his nation within weeks.   In India, two pharmaceutical firms - including Serum Institute, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer - on Monday sought fast-track approval for coronavirus shots.
 India is the world's second-worst hit nation, with more than 140,000 recorded deaths.   And in Brazil's densely populated Sao Paulo state - Latin America's coronavirus epicenter - authorities will launch a campaign from January providing the Chinese-developed vaccine CoronaVac to healthcare workers, older people and vulnerable groups first.
 Restrictions remain   Even as hopes rise for vaccines and a resulting economic recovery, governments are being forced to tighten restrictions to contain surges in infections.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged regions with high infection rates to tighten curbs, while Denmark said it will close middle and high schools, bars, cafes and restaurants in half of the country.
 But Austrians got a boost when the government lifted its measures earlier this week.   Israel announced a nationwide night-time curfew from December 9 following a steep increase in cases. And Hong Kong announced a ban on evening restaurant dining and the closure of fitness centers to contain a new virus cases.

As long as you can point to a time when things were worse you think I [and presumably everyone else] should just relax and be as comfortable with the death and destruction going on now as you are. And we should not worry that it might possibly explode into something way worse. As long as the killing happens beyond our borders we should be happy and not complain about the methods or motives that are being employed to keep the mountains from falling on us. In the long history of mankind the recent history of less war is a very short blip on the timeline and there is no good reason to think it will continue to trend that way for very long if we continue to follow roughly the same course that has historically led powerful tribes and countries into big wars that ultimately brought them down as major powers.

It said that around two million employees who earn less than £120 a week are not eligible for sick pay at all. This includes one in four part-time workers, one in seven of those who work in retail, hospitality and leisure – customer facing roles.
 The Resolution Foundation said that expanding the furlough scheme would cost around £426 million a month if 643,000 people used it. This would replace the £112 million being paid out in Statutory Sick Pay.
 It also urged more help for self-employed workers who need to self-isolate.
 Ms Gustafsson added: “Coronavirus vaccines will take many months to roll out, so more workers will need to self-isolate at home to contain the spread of the virus next year.
 “Given the failure of the current sick pay regime, the Government must turn now to the far more successful job support schemes to provide workers and firms with the financial support they need to do the right thing.”

It’s been one heck of an interesting year, to say the least. Now that we’re approaching Christmas, I imagine you’re busy shopping for gifts, decorating or baking cookies – unless you already did that back in October. Ever since the pandemic pushed us into lockdown last spring, it seems as if people are going bananas trying to find ways to pass the time while being cooped up inside their homes. One look at social media and you see people posting all sorts of crazy recipes, trying to concoct things they normally would never try or doing some sort of dance moves. No wonder everyone had the time to Christmas shop before Halloween!
 I’ve been fortunate enough to still be working nonstop (either from home or the studio), but I have to admit that I did carve out time during the week before Thanksgiving to put up my outdoor Christmas decorations while the weather was still warm. I still refused, though, to turn on the lights or put the wreath on the front door until the day after Thanksgiving.
 Since date night now is pretty much confined to either cooking (who wants to do that?) or getting takeout and a bottle of wine, I broke out a jigsaw puzzle for my boyfriend and me to tackle a couple of weeks ago. It was a Christmas gift from two years prior, and it’s a 1,000-piece panorama view of the huge crowd at a WVU football game at Mountaineer Field from a few years ago. We think it was a photo from the first Big 12 game against Baylor. If so, my boyfriend was there, even though we can’t absolutely identify him in the puzzle despite using a magnifying glass.
 The puzzle sat in its box in the closet for two years, and this was the perfect time to bust it open. It was a daunting task made even more difficult by the fact that neither of us had done a jigsaw puzzle in decades! I remembered the trick of sorting like pieces and trying to assemble the perimeter first. That helped immensely, and we toiled away laughing and sipping wine for a few hours. We made good progress, and I spent a couple of hours each night the following week chipping away at it until I finally finished.

 While Mike Krzyzewski watched Illinois dominate his Duke basketball team at Cameron Indoor Stadium Tuesday night, the coronavirus pandemic took another ACC team off the court.
 During Illinois' 83-68 win over the Blue Devils in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, ESPN announced the Virginia-Michigan State game scheduled for Wednesday night as part of the event won't be played.
 Virginia has COVID-19 issues within its program, so the game that was supposed to be played in Charlottesville, Virginia, is off.
 Krzyzewski, the sport's all-time leader in coaching wins, said the whole situation, trying to get the games in during the pandemic, keeping players away from their families to keep them healthy to play games, doesn't feel right.
 "I don't think it feels right to anybody," Krzyzewski said. "I mean, everyone is concerned."

Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) scrutinised data of 16 lakh medical students and doctors to nab 36 impersonators, who had taken Madhya Pradesh pre-medical test or MPPMT-2009 on the behalf of actual candidates and cleared it, said an officer of CBI.
 CBI filed supplementary charge-sheets in the court of special magistrate in Gwalior on Tuesday against 126 accused including candidates, impersonators, parents/guardians and middlemen related to PMT-2009 conducted by Vyapam now known as Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB).
 "CBI had registered the case on August 21, 2015 on the orders of Supreme Court of India. During CBI investigation, it was found that 36 candidates had allegedly arranged impersonators to appear in the written examination of MPPMT-2009 on their behalf with the help of middlemen, parents and accordingly they illegally passed the examination and got admission in a private medical colleges," said CBI public relation officer RK Gaur said.
 He suggested it required voluminous work by the CBI to nab the accused.
   
   
 "CBI had prepared a database of around 16 lakh students including the students who were taking coaching of PMT in various institutes, MBBS students of various medical colleges and registered doctors of MP and Uttar Pradesh. CBI also took expert opinions from forensic experts on photographs and handwritings available on the OMR answer sheets of accused candidates," said Gaur.

 After comparing pictures and handwriting, CBI found some new impersonators, he added.
 According to an investigating officer, this investigation took about more than four and a-half-years after the CBI had filed a charge-sheet against the accused booked by State's special task force (STF) in June 2016.
 In all, 3,500 people were made accused by the CBI in different cases and 250 of them are new accused, who were not identified by the probe conducted by STF.
 The Vyapam scam came to light in July 2013 when Indore police arrested 20 impersonators appearing for medical entrance examination helping undeserving candidates to secure high ranks. The cheating net also involved a clique of politicians and bureaucrats that facilitated the fraud in exchange for bribes, according to investigators. The CBI took over the case in 2015.

That’s why, upon being named this year’s _Observer-Reporter’s_ Best of the Best Person of the Year, she says being “the best” also means enabling others to be their best. Basking in the afterglow of a beautiful Thanksgiving meal with close family, I chatted with Ellis the day after our socially distanced feasts about what winning the honor meant to her and how she came to become executive director of the LeMoyne Center.
 “I’m blessed,” she said contently, explaining she works tirelessly to alter her environment so that others can become better.
 Answering the call
 “I will always be synonymous with dance,” Ellis explained.
 A lifelong Washington resident, she opened her first dance studio at 17, while still a junior in high school. Dance was her passion. She dedicated her life to her dancers, encouraging their parents not to spend exorbitant amounts of money on costumes and refusing to let the students wear makeup in favor of showcasing their natural beauty.
 She knew that she had something special as her dancers performed the entire length of parades and kept on that path of excellence. Ellis and her dance crew performed for the Steelers, Pirates and Wild Things.
 But, about a decade ago, Ellis said God called her to give up dance. Her studios would close within five years. Ellis said she pushed that thought away, that she was doing good work through her studios and changing lives. She wasn’t just teaching dance, but also real-life skills.
 Then, three years after that first call from God, that voice returned, harsher and more persistent.
 “You’re going to be challenged in every way, but stay true to the path and trust me,” she recalls.
 Ellis questioned, how much more challenge can I handle? She says she never understood true challenge until she gave up dance. Three of her dance studios were forced to close in close succession by seemingly biblical events: a bug infestation, flood and gas line break. Her Lord was trying to get her attention.
 Focus on the center
 At that point, Ellis turned her attention to the LeMoyne Center. Before she took over in 2007, the community center building sat unused, damaged by arson and forced to shutter its doors because of mismanagement. Many of the windows were broken or spray-painted. But Ellis had a plan to change the community’s trajectory through this building, shifting hopelessness to hope. She was met with skepticism at all sides, even from the Black community, but carried on. The first program she established was Camp Challenge, a chance for kids to explore the world through the arts and creativity in a summer camp. It opened the world up to participants, some who had never traveled to Pittsburgh and were now afforded the chance to take field trips.

Getting news for the new _Mortal Kombat_ film certainly is an exciting prospect as it was not until it was confirmed for a same day HBO Max and theatrical release next year that we actually got the first look at the new film's official logo. Releasing on January 15th in both theaters and on HBO Max (for the first month of release) the film will be bringing in all sorts of familiar names from the games to the screen.
 With the film wrapping filming late last year, fans are still hoping to see the cast in action. That cast includes the likes of the previously mentioned Lewis Tan, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Mehcad Brooks as Jax, Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, Hiroyuki Sanada as Scorpion, Josh Lawson as Kano, Tadanobu Asano as Raiden, Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero, Chin Han as Shang Tsung, Sisi Stringer as Mileena, and Daniel Nelson as Kabal (who was most recently confirmed for the film).

Last Friday the Lockport school district announced that students will be returning to all at-home classes again in a week. Hours later, Sarah Hahn, a junior at Lockport High School, posted a raw expression of her feelings to a community Facebook group. I think she speaks for hundreds of young people here and with her permission I am sharing what she wrote:
 “I just have one thing to say and forgive me if this isn’t allowed but as a kid in high school, I’m hurting. Some people sat there with happiness, comfort, joy when they heard that school was going back to full remote. Me? I sat there and cried. My heart shattered. Back to square one. How can one learn through a screen? How can computerized technology make up for my education?”
 “How do I feel like I earned my diploma and am ready for the world when I stare at a screen all day and get free passes on exams? Since when does a google meet fit all learning styles? Where’s the hands on? Where’s the communication? The days I WAS allowed to go to school, where were all the smiles and laughter? Hidden behind a mask, was silence, frowns, stress of all. There was no laughter, no happiness, you could hear a pin drop because there was no social interaction.”

Twenty-three years ago, a handful of people had a vision for preserving old- growth forests in Virginia. Not that we had many.
 When Europeans first came here, the land was thick with old giants, but by the time of the Civil War, nearly the entire state had been clear-cut.
 Less than one-half of 1% is truly old growth. Slowly, some larger areas are being allowed to regenerate.
 Old-growth forests provide critical habitat for many species, including salamanders, soil invertebrates, small mammals, songbirds and black bears. Standing dead wood is important for many wildlife species.
 Gaps in the canopy are a common occurrence in old growth, allowing greater sunlight to reach the forest floor and creating three to five layers of understory, rather than one to two layers in younger forests.

Instead, it's better to note that Diana has had a fairly long career that allowed her to be successful, and it's easy to think that her retirement was her decision and that she wasn't forced out or convinced to step away from the life. It does tend to happen that some folks get the idea that they're being pushed out at some point since their star has dimmed and they're not expected to stick around once the part is over for them. It feels as though some people definitely try to stick in as long as they can, but others are more than ready to go on their way since they've had enough and are ready to kick back and relax and enjoy the rest of their life. It's hard to say which type Diana is, but since she hasn't been seen to come back it's likely that she's one of the many that stepped away and was happy to stay gone since coming back at this point might be kind of difficult, to say the least since competing with the actors that are in the business now might not be the biggest hurdle. Instead, it might be dealing with all the changes that have come to the business in just the past two decades since the entertainment industry continues to change in ways that people are having to deal with left and right. Even those that belong to the current younger generations aren't able to keep up with everything, so it's fair to state that those such as Diana might have a little trouble at least since it's very possible that they would find the changes to be kind of odd.

Washington is on its third quarterback in former starter Alex Smith, playing for the first time in two years after a career-threatening leg injury. Smith has Washington on a three-game winning streak, capped by a drive to a tiebreaking field goal late against the Steelers.
 Dallas (3-9) was all but removed from the conversation with its sixth loss in seven games, 34-17 at Baltimore on Tuesday night. The Cowboys have the worst record in the NFC, and the most realistic path to the playoffs would be tying the Giants at the top with a season sweep of New York, their opponent in the finale.
 NFC NORTH
 Green Bay (9-3) has a three-game lead over Minnesota with four to go and is currently the No. 2 seed in the NFC. Three of the Packers' opponents currently have losing records.
 The Vikings (6-6) hold the last of the seven playoff spots in the NFC right now with a big opportunity to put a tighter grip on that spot if they can beat Tom Brady at Tampa Bay on Sunday.
 New Orleans is also on the schedule, so Minnesota could be looking at must wins against division rivals Chicago and Detroit, the two NFC North teams with losing records at the moment.
 The Bears (5-7) have lost six in a row since a 5-1 start, putting Matt Nagy on the coaching hot seat after the Lions (5-7) already fired Matt Patricia.
 NFC SOUTH
 What looked like a duel between the Brady-led Buccaneers and Drew Brees' Saints for the division title -- and possibly that lone first-round bye -- has faded with three losses in four games by Tampa Bay (7-5).
 Meanwhile, the division lead for the Saints (10-2) has grown to three games because they're doing the same thing they did last year: win without Brees.
 Teddy Bridgewater went 5-0 a year ago, and Taysom Hill has won his first three starts since Brees left a 27-13 win over San Francisco on Nov. 15 with broken ribs and a collapsed lung. New Orleans has won nine straight games since a 1-2 start.
 Atlanta (4-8) has been better since getting buried by an 0-5 start that included the firing of coach Dan Quinn. Carolina (4-8) has been without star running back Christian McCaffrey for nine games because of ankle and shoulder injuries in coach Matt Rhule's first season.
 NFC WEST
 It's still the NFC's best division, but the struggles of the Seahawks and Cardinals have changed things some.
 The Los Angeles Rams have won three out of four to get even atop the NFC West with Seattle, which is 3-4 since the first 5-0 start in franchise history.
 The Rams have the tiebreaker at the moment by virtue of their 23-16 win over the Seahawks, so their rematch in the second-to-last week of the season looms large. If Seattle wins Dec. 27, the subsequent tiebreakers of division records and records with other common opponents are a tossup right now.
 With three consecutive losses and four in the past five games, Kyler Murray and the Cardinals (6-6) suddenly find themselves as the first team out of the playoff picture, losing at the moment to the Vikings on the common opponent tiebreaker.
 San Francisco, the defending NFC champion, hasn't been able to dig out of last place in the difficult division the past two months. An uplifting win over the Rams two weeks ago was followed by a decisive loss to Buffalo on Monday night. The game was moved to Arizona because of coronavirus restrictions in the 49ers' home county.
 While the 49ers (5-7) aren't completely out of the race, they'll need help to avoid being the second straight NFC champ to miss the playoffs the next season. It happened to LA last year.

Good intentions don’t always pass muster. That’s the case with an anti- spoofing law passed unanimously by the 2019 Legislature.

 The practice spoofs or tricks a phone recipient into believing a call is coming from a number other than the one from which it originated. North Dakotans have been complaining about spoof calls and robocalls, a different practice that generates massive calls per second.

 Recently, Mayor Paige Gebhardt Cognetti and U.S. Sen. Bob Casey presided at a ceremony unveiling a street sign along the 2400 block of North Washington Avenue, at Fisk Street, to honor the president-elect, who was born in that neighborhood.
 The designation of Joe Biden Way is a fitting gesture.
 Biden spent his first 10 years in Scranton before moving in 1952 with his family to Wilmington, Delaware.

 Local media reported the patient on the Quantum of the Seas was an 83-year-old Singaporean and was among 1,680 guests and 1,148 crew members on board. It returned to port on the third day of a four-day trip.
 It was reported the passenger had tested negative for Covid-19 before boarding and when he consulted the online medical team after a stomach complaint, he was tested again and found to be positive.
 Passengers were asked to stay in their cabins and emergency response plans were activated including immediate isolation of close contacts, contact tracing and deep cleaning of the ship.

The NFC East suddenly doesn't look so bad, with the New York Giants and Washington tied for the division lead coming off road victories against teams that qualify for the conversation about the Super Bowl.
 The Giants, who beat Seattle on Sunday, control their fate because they swept Washington, and could become the first team to make the playoffs after starting 1-7. Washington is also 5-7 after handing Pittsburgh its first loss Monday night.
 Those were the first two victories over opponents with winning records this season for the only division in the NFL without a winning team. But the NFC East winner will get a home game in the first round of the playoffs, expanded by one team in each conference because of the pandemic. The altered format also means just one first-round bye, currently held by New Orleans (10-2), the only NFC team to clinch a postseason berth so far.
 "I had a lot of questions obviously early in the year about things like confidence on the team and where were we going, and really our mindset here is just go back to work every week, and that's what we're going to do this week as well," first-year Giants coach Joe Judge said.

The holidays are upon us again. And new technology is often at the top of wish lists this time of year. In fact, tech gifts are the most sought after during the holiday shopping season, bar none.
 With hundreds of gadgets to choose from it can quickly get confusing for even the most tech-savvy shoppers, let alone the wannabes out there. While I’m not big on “buy this not that” lists, I wanted to do something to address the confusion and maybe shed a little light on the choices shoppers face this year in the process.
 This is by no means a shopping guide or even a “best of “ list, but hopefully it helps some of you sort out the gifts for the gadget geek in your life.
 Let’s start with the big one: video games. The top tech on every gamers’ list this year is a new console. Unlike smartphones, which seem to get new versions every few months, game consoles have much longer life cycles. The PlayStation 5 is Sony’s first truly new console generation since the PlayStation 4 launched in 2013. Microsoft’s Xbox has had an almost identical life cycle.
 The newest generation of consoles have seen a rough launch with shortages, confusion about availability and scalpers buying up stocks to resell them for a premium. To make matters worse for Microsoft fans out there, their naming pattern continues to be confusing.
 So to clear things up, for Sony PlayStation fans the new console you’ll want to look for is the PlayStation 5. Now, there are two models with two different price points. The only thing to keep in mind is that the more expensive model comes with a disk drive while the less expensive one does not which means the usersc will only be able to buy digital copies of games.
 For Microsoft fans, the new console is called the Xbox Series X or for the cheaper version the Xbox Series S. Do not be confused by the Xbox One X or the Xbox One S, which are the previous console generation names.
 While there is no new Nintendo system out with this generation, you’ll likely have more luck buying a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch Lite than you will with either Sony or Microsoft’s new consoles. And honestly, if your loved one is a gamer, and they don’t own a Switch yet, I can’t recommend them enough. It’s one of the funnest consoles in recent memory.
 Obviously the new consoles will be hot items this season, I would expect nothing less. But getting your hands on one will likely be next to impossible. So, here are a few other simple—but cool—tech gifts you could look for this holiday season.
 Know somebody that is prone to misplacing their keys, their wallet or their phone? The Tile Pro is an awesome little tracking device that can be setup via Bluetooth and attached to your small items so you can ping them if they go missing.
 If someone in your life hasn’t started wiring their home to be a smart home yet there has never been a better time. The Alex Dot is as cheap as it has ever been right now. A couple of these and a pack of smart bulbs will make an awesome gift.
 Smartwatches will likely be another big request this year. The Apple Watch is the pinnacle but there are plenty of others that are just as good—and much cheaper. A great alternative to the Apple Watch is the Fitbit Versa 2, the latest version of the Fitbit activity tracker. But unlike the now archaic original Fitbit, which simply tracked your steps, the Versa 2 is a fully functional smart watch with Alexa built in.
 And of course, when in doubt, just ask. Tech nerds are usually more than happy to direct you to their favorites brands.

Put trust in Jesus
 It is quite evident the truth is a very hard pill to swallow, especially if you pledge affiliation to the immoral liberal agenda. A truth so painful they will do all they can to silence it, ban it and remove it from everyday life.
 Despite all the disruptions from COVID-19 this year don’t think for one minute it will stop the wicked left from trying to take away the true meaning of Christmas as we now approach this joyous season. They are quick to tell their children to believe [in fairy tales] but will fight tooth and nail to deem the very truth of Jesus Christ birth as offensive and even in some cases illegal.
 Like it or not Jesus Christ came to earth over 2,000 years ago, the ultimate gift to save us all from our sins and that is a proven fact through the Bible, history and even declaration from the United States government who acknowledge trust in God as it’s shown in its motto and even our federal currency. With that being said, I say to my community and everyone across the nation: Don’t cave in fear sing joyful songs of praise, put up your manger scene and declare your faith and put your trust in Jesus Christ the reason for the season!

Five new San Diego City Council members will take the oath of office on Dec. 10.

Will they choose the proven leader who earned the overwhelming support of a broad cross-section of San Diegans seeking a brighter future for everyone in our region? Or will they defy the wisdom and will of the people by choosing an obsolete status quo preferred by establishment insiders and backroom dealmakers? Historically, San Diego’s shadow government of moneyed interests has played a disproportionate role in the decision-making process while excluding large swaths of the population, particularly working-class communities of color, from having meaningful input.

The success rate has been generally high both in the USA and Nigeria at all the centres where I work. The results differ from one patient to another, and some other centres do have low success rates. I too have had a couple of patients with delayed onset of effectiveness of treatment or patients needing additional or second treatment sessions before they begin to see positive results. It is important to mention or remind ourselves that there is no guarantee in medicine despite the hype surrounding Adult Stem Cell Therapy or Regenerative Medicine as a whole. It does not work 100 percent of the time. Nonetheless, there is a very high success rate amongst the patients with non- bleeding Acute Stroke when treatment is done within a couple of days to few weeks, with the goal of preventing permanent residual symptoms post stroke. This was evident in all our non-hemorrhagic Acute Stroke patients that we treated directly at our facility or through consultation in other hospitals, ranging from a top government official to a low-income grandmother. The general rule of thumb is that the earlier the treatment is given in acute injuries, the higher the success rate.

Notre Dame and Clemson didn’t expect to have an extra week to prepare for their rematch in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game.
 But in a season of unexpected challenges and unique situations, they’ll take it.
 The second-ranked Fighting Irish and No. 4 Tigers now have two weeks before their rematch in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship on Dec 19 in Charlotte, North Carolina.
 The Fighting Irish (10-0) and Tigers (9-1) got an extra week off after the ACC decided not to have its championship combatants play rescheduled games due to COVID-19 postponements the week before the title showdown.
 “It is definitely unique for sure,” Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said.
 Especially given that the teams met in a drama-filled, 47-40 double overtime game won by the Irish on Nov. 7. The coronavirus played a role in that one, too. Tigers quarterback Trevor Lawrence watched from the sidelines after testing positive for the virus.
 Lawrence has since returned, leading Clemson to victories over Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech to qualify for the Tigers’ sixth straight ACC championship game — the only Power Five program to do that since conference championship games became a thing in 1992.
 Swinney expects to run practices this week similar to what he has done during other bye weeks in his 12 full seasons as coach. The Tigers will concentrate on themselves at practice until cracking open the plans for Notre Dame later in the week.
 Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly acknowledges the strange circumstances and will try and create a game-week environment during his team’s time off.
 Kelly wants Notre Dame players in the weight room and on the practice field, working hard as if they were playing Saturday instead of in two weeks.
 He’ll have a practice involving tackling on Saturday, so his players can flow into a typical Sunday of treatment and recovery with another game ahead.
 “We want to get back into a disciplined environment relative to our preparation in practice and we want to maintain our routine as best possible,” Kelly said.
 This season has been anything but routine for the Irish. The staunchly independent Notre Dame joined the ACC this season because of the struggles finding teams to play given Power Five conferences like the Southeastern Conference, Big Ten Conference and Pac-12 Conference going to all-league schedules.
 The ACC and Big 12 conferences, which got started earlier than their other three counterparts, allowed just one non-conference game.
 Part of Swinney’s plans for the two-weeks leading up to rematch is not over- analyzing Notre Dame.
 “We are who we are. They are who they are,” he said. “The things that got you there, you’re not going to all of sudden get away from those things. You’ve got to be good at what you do.”
 Being full strength will help the Tigers on both sides of the ball.
 Lawrence and several injured defensive starters — tackle Tyler Davis and linebackers James Skalski and Mike Jones Jr. — are set to play in the title game after missing the first game with Notre Dame.
 Lawrence’s backup, DJ Uiagalelei, was certainly capable enough, throwing for 439 yards to break the school’s freshman record held by national champion quarterback Deshaun Watson.
 But Kelly said having Lawrence back behind center gives Clemson the comfort level of having their experienced offensive leader in control.
 The Irish have heard those say that Notre Dame’s victory last month came in part because Clemson was undermanned.
 “Our guys listen to that, so we’re gonna have that challenge in front of us that we’ll have to go and play very well against a team that will have all their best players,” Kelly said.
 Clemson receiver Cornell Powell, who had six catches for 161 yards and a touchdown against the Irish last time out, said Notre Dame’s defense was disciplined, tough and fast. He expects the same when they play again.
 “It was just a great game. Competition was at an all time high,” Powell said. “I’m really looking forward to next Saturday.”

Boss Frank Lampard has repeatedly warned his Chelsea squad they cannot “flick the switch” off and on when it comes to delivering top performances.
 However extensive the rotation proves across this hectic festive schedule, Lampard has demanded minimum standards from his players.
 This was perhaps the first time that his men failed to meet those requirements – but if there were ever any time to fall short, this was it.
 Billy Gilmour impressed, typically mixing tidiness with attacking threat from midfield, while 19-year-old full debutant Tino Anjorin showed encouraging progress.
 Chelsea started slowly, especially without the ball.
 Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen appeared sluggish, causing problems for their full-backs when Krasnodar attacked at speed.
 Viktor Claesson whipped an effort wide when afforded far too much time and space in the box, which yielded a major reprieve for the hosts and that tentative defence.
 The Blues failed to heed the lesson though, and Cabella took full advantage.

Information Technology, which was a mere support function in the past, is today at the core of an organization. As a result it has become critical that the tech human capital of an organization is up to speed with emerging technologies, which may vary from the upgraded versions of the existing technologies, and explore open source or transitioning to AI, RPA, Cloud, etc. Upgrading skills is not only about sending employees for some training programs, but motivating and encouraging them to learn and experiment. It is critical for the success of an organization that its tech resources are well upgraded and ready to experiment.      “The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation across industries, but for this transformation to be effective in future-proofing businesses for the next normal, helping the workforce embrace and adapt to a new way of working, learning, and doing business is critical. Enabling a shift in mindset is the primary challenge because change can be daunting at this speed and scale. To make it easy for employees to adapt, continuous learning and training must become a priority. Here, organizations must leverage easy-to-use and simplified virtual, e-learning, and blended learning tools as the workforce becomes increasingly distributed and remote,” said Dharmendra Rangain, CIO, Cisco India and SAARC.      Every individual is different in terms of their learning and capabilities. In such a dynamic environment of the organisation, choosing the right delivery method becomes very important. With workforces becoming more diverse and distributed than ever before, organizations realize that going forward, effective L&D programs must be engaging, flexible, and digital to enable a productive learning environment, digital or in-person.     
 Mehmood Mansoori, President - Shared Services & Online Business, HDFC ERGO General Insurance, said, “Right delivery method must be a blend of both conceptual and experiential learning. While knowledge based learning can be driven on a Self-Paced mode, skill based training requires an instructor-led methodology followed by structured on the job activities. Constant review of progress is also important and immediate supervisors play a critical role in this process. Another useful engagement tool for post training applications is to create learning groups with peers to help each other. Hence, it’s a combination of multiple interventions to ensure that the learning is applicable in daily routine and impacts productivity,”      Mansoori believes that the right method has to ensure a consistent approach to Learn, Practice, Apply and Evaluate. However, the key to success is giving environment freedom and, more importantly, time to employees for them to apply the learning as well as build solutions on an experimental basis that will help the organization. Encouragement and recognition of what they have done matters the most, and their quest for learning goes up at the end of the day. In the world of open source, it is self learning at one’s own pace which makes the big difference.     
 Sometimes even the right delivery method for LnD in the absence of right learning conditions. Therefore, Ankur Walunjkar, Senior Director, Deloitte India suggested, “It is equally important to create conditions for IT employees to anticipate the shift in skills and the ability to rapidly develop themselves. This can be achieved by empowering the business and the workforce to have a view of the shifting landscape and the access to the 4Es of development - Education, Experience, Exposure and the Environment,”      Any new learning is a step-by-step journey. Innovation is not possible, unless we don’t experiment. Learning, as a process, is bound to have success and failures when applied. It is important to allow people to explore and experiment; else they would keep walking the beaten path and won’t take on newer opportunities.      “It definitely adds more wisdom when employees know what is not to be done or the task repeatedly to be successful in the process. This is the precise reason we have set up our Digital Innovation Lab with around 25 resources. They have no line responsibility and are given full freedom to explore and experiment. This is helping us identify suitable use cases on emerging tech for the organisation and keeps us ahead of the curve,” added Mehmood Mansoori, President - Shared Services & Online Business, HDFC ERGO General Insurance.
