In honor of the 27th annual Tanger Pink campaign, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. is offering shoppers special savings in return for supporting the ongoing efforts to end breast cancer.
 Tanger has been involved in the fight against breast cancer for the last 27 years and this year is no exception, even amid the pandemic. All proceeds from the campaign will support the Breast Cancer Research Foundation as well as the Piedmont Athens Regional Breast Cancer Program and the Loran Smith Center for Cancer Support.
 “We are excited to continue working with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and local organizations this fall,” said Steven B. Tanger, CEO of Tanger Outlets. “We are committed to supporting the research that will hopefully lead to a cure for a disease that has impacted so many families. Having faced many challenges this year due to COVID-19, we are even more committed to coming together as a strong and united force to continue to fight for a cure.”
 Now through October 31, the campaign is offering unlimited use digital Pink Savings cards to Tanger shoppers to make their experience as contactless and touchless as possible. The savings cards give recipients 25 percent off and can be used all month long at any and all participating stores. Tanger will also offer three ways to shop during Pink, including in-person shopping, curbside pick-up and the virtual shopper program. Shoppers can save big on the best brand names and designer fashions including Banana Republic, Crocs, J. Crew, Old Navy Outlet, Simply Southern, Polo Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors and many more.
