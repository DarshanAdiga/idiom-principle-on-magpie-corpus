On this incremental development for students across the South-East Asia region, Hersh Shah, CEO, India Chapter of Institute of Risk Management, UK, said, "Our mission is to expand IRM's global community and empower candidates to prepare for a professional career in Enterprise Risk Management at their comfort. We are confident that students will now have sufficient time to plan their studies and prepare for the professional qualification. Generally, about 65% students have cleared the Level 1 examination in recent months and almost 97% of the candidates agree that they are able to think from a risk perspective and have become analytical in their approach after IRM's Level 1. Further, in contrast to the traditional perspective towards risk management, 60% of our candidates work in non-insurance roles, indicating the broadening acknowledgement of the true scope of risk management in the country." Sangeeta Gamre, All-India rank-holder, said, "This has been an excellent start to recognising & understanding various aspects of risks in organisation at all levels. The Level 1 touches end to end concepts of risk, though this is just the beginning. I still have a long way to go, and I would now like to pursue Level 2." Chelna Gothi, student, Mithibai College, said, "I did not clear the exam in the first attempt as I thought the questions would be generic and direct from the study materials. When I failed, I realised I need to prepare better, focus on the application of the theory, and use the study resources provided by IRM much more seriously. The Level 1 examination is tough if one does not prepare well, and it can get very confusing, with risk being such a vast subject. The study support sessions helped me a lot as well. I am extremely happy that all the efforts finally paid off, and I look forward to pursuing the Level 2 qualification." Sanjay Himatsingani, Director, IRM Global, said, "The pandemic has sharply exposed the vulnerability of organisations of all sizes, to uncertainties and unforeseen threats. In the coming time, many more companies will undertake a course correction in their view towards risk management, to secure themselves against future crises. Investors will also take a sharper lens to the risk management policies and practices of startups they are considering investing in. This reorientation will be led by trained enterprise risk professionals, who possess the vision and analytical ability to anticipate potential risks, devise mitigation strategies, and navigate their organisations to the successful achievement of their objectives. IRM's globally-recognized qualifications equip professionals with the skills necessary to become the vanguards of this transformation." The Level 1 ERM examination will now be conducted four times a year, that is, February, May, August and November, on the last Sunday of the respective month, from 4 PM - 5:30 PM IST, with a basic requirement of an internet connection and a fully functional webcam. The format consists of one paper, which is application and case study based, and the results of the exams are announced within 10 working days. For students to prepare for the examination, IRM also offers basic virtual study support sessions delivered by IRM experts, study material and webinars by IRM's international experts, at no additional fee. The Level 1 Examination can be pursued by students and working professionals alongside their graduation, post-graduation or professional career. Candidates who are aspiring business leaders across all sectors including financial services, risk consultants, entrepreneurs, family business owners or chief risk officers, have been enrolling for IRM's examinations. At each stage after Level 1, candidates are entitled to a globally-recognised designation - IRMCert (level 2), GradIRM (Level 3), CMIRM (Level 4) and CFIRM (Level 5) - upon successful completion.

The United States (US) presidential election is a fork in the road for the future of the world's most powerful nation and, therefore, the international system as a whole. This is reflected in the contrasting personalities of the candidates. Donald Trump personifies almost everything deemed fatal to the electoral chances of a US presidential candidate, with his not-so-subtle racism, erratic and almost absurd public pronouncements, and absence of leadership skills. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is cut from the same establishment cloth that has determined Washington's values and worldview for decades.Mr Trump's rise reflects a deeper failure in the US system to address the growing immiseration of its working class. He is a beneficiary of this inequality and, ironically, given his background, the political voice of the anger stemming from it. Mr Biden's weakness is that he is part of the system that is seen as having failed by about half the US population. Fortunately for him, Covid-19 and Mr Trump's toxic character have made this an election about opposing the president rather than favouring Mr Biden.A second Trump administration will see a continuing erosion of the US's public institutions. It will also see socially conservative views, drawn from extreme religious views, make inroads into the American system. On the other hand, the Trump administration has shown a greater willingness to call a spade a spade in the international sphere than it was thought possible by a US government. A disinterest in US interventions in West Asia and a willingness to directly confront China are two manifestations -- and both have worked in favour of Indian interests. A Biden administration would see some effort to address the social issues that led to Mr Trump's rise. Many of its solutions would mirror those of the present administration, including backtracking from free trade and a renewed support for State-funded industrial policies. There are a number of urgent issues on which a President Biden would be a major improvement, most notably the climate crisis. Given India's overall interests, the real expectation from a Biden administration would be the restoration of legitimacy at home so that the US can maintain pre-eminence overseas.

In the ongoing three-phase Bihar assembly polls, a large number of candidates with criminal antecedents are in the fray, despite Election Commission of India's (ECI) guidelines following a Supreme Court (SC) order to rein in such anti-social elements. The SC directive sought greater accountability from parties to eradicate the criminalisation of politics. In February, the SC had directed candidates and parties to mandatorily publicise pending criminal cases through advertisements in a local and a national newspaper. Parties need to share the details of the tainted candidates on their official social media platforms and explain the reasons for fielding them. The SC had observed that "winnability" alone did not count as the primary reason for tainted candidates' selection. The parties were also directed to file a compliance report with the ECI or else they would be held in contempt of court. However, data showed that compliance to the guideline has been few and far between. The rule stipulates that the information is required to be furnished within 48 hours of the selection of candidates and not less than two weeks before the first date for filing of nomination papers. Also read | In Bihar elections, the narrative shifts to Kashmir, Ram TempleIn the first phase, out of 1,066 candidates in the fray, 327 had declared criminal cases. Data showed that 104 candidates did not put out any advertisement to inform the public about the criminal cases pending against them.Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), a non-partisan, non- governmental organisation (NGO), which works in the area of electoral and political reforms, has found that the ruling Janata Dal (United), the Congress, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are the only parties which listed the reasons for fielding candidates with criminal antecedents. In the second phase, which goes to polls on Tuesday (November 3), the percentage has gone up from 31% to 34%. Of the 1,463 candidates in the fray, 502 and 389 have reported criminal cases and those of serious nature, respectively, pending against them. In the third phase, which will be held on Saturday (November 7), out of the 1,204 candidates in the fray, ADR-Election Watch analysed 1,195, of which 371 (31%) and 282 (24%) have declared criminal cases and those of serious nature, respectively, pending against them. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the main party in Bihar, has fielded the maximum number of candidates with criminal record, followed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and the ruling Janata Dal (United), or the JD (U). Data revealed that 37 candidates declared cases related to atrocities against women. Six candidates face rape cases, and 20 have declared murder cases against them. Another 73 candidates have declared attempt to murder cases against them. "There seems to be no apparent impact of the SC directive on candidates facing criminal cases, as they continue to find favour with all parties," said Rajiv Kumar of Election Watch. The parties, which have put out the details of candidates facing criminal charges in the public domain, have cited various reasons for their selection such as popularity, social work, educational background, effective coronavirus disease (Covid-19) management, vendetta by rival parties for implicating them etc. "The reasons for the selection (of candidates with criminal record) have to be with reference to qualifications, achievements and merit of the candidate concerned. Unfounded and baseless reasons given by political parties such as popularity of the person, does good social work, cases are politically motivated etc are not sound and cogent reasons for fielding candidates with tainted backgrounds," the ADR report added.The ECI has taken note of the non-compliance of the SC order."We have served show- cause notices to all those, who have not complied with the EC directive for violation of guidelines. They have to send their replies. Appropriate action will follow after receiving their responses. More notices will be issued after assessing the records in the remaining two phases of polling," said Sanjay Singh, additional chief electoral officer (ACEO).As per the guidelines, the ECI will draw the SC's attention to the non-compliance by parties and can held in contempt of court.A similar trend was also noticed during last year's parliamentary polls. A recent analysis by ADR and Bihar Election Watch (BEW) said that since 2005, out of 10,785 candidates, who had contested either Lok Sabha or assembly elections, 3,230 (30%) and 2,204 (20%) declared criminal cases and those of serious nature, respectively, pending against them. Such candidates belong to all parties and also some independents. Out of 820 members of Parliament (MP) from Bihar and members of the state legislative assembly (MLAs) 469 (57%) and 295 (36%) declared criminal cases and those of serious nature, respectively, pending against them.The report also underscored that tainted candidates' assets have seen a steady rise through the years. The data showed that parties have no interest in reforming the electoral system and Indian democracy will continue to suffer at the hands of lawbreakers, who aspire to become lawmakers.

It’s hard to say precisely what we learned as Usyk (18-0) outlasted Chisora (32-10) by cutting his fuel line early in the fight, waiting for the larger man to gas out and securing a clear-cut decision on points. It was a deceptively difficult task for Usyk but he played it almost perfectly. A size “advantage,” especially at heavyweight – where anything goes above 200 pounds – sometimes just translates to leaden feet and love handles. There is a reason we don’t compare Butterbean to Muhammad Ali. But Chisora went into the fight in excellent condition – thick, but tight as a drum – and used his mass effectively. For all his performative buffoonery over the years, Chisora is a decent and dangerous fighter at his best, and he pressurised Usyk smartly in the early rounds, cutting off angles, punching relentlessly and frequently forcing the Ukrainian to the ropes inside a small ring.

 Every night, at 8 pm, a bedtime story is uploaded on the channel. Daily ‘viewer’ figures range from 1,000 to 2,000 views, and the channel has 13,000 followers.
 Rakesh’s seven-year-old son and his demands for a bedtime story gave the friends this idea. As they tossed it between them, they hit up on the no-video story-telling platform idea. “For close to four months, we tried variations in narration as research — with background score and without, with sound effects — ‘experimenting’ on our friends and their kids. We tweaked content and presentation based on feedback,” says Rakesh. They learnt interesting facts during the course of their research: for instance, it was parents who expected the accompanying videos and not the children.
 “Children are okay with listening, in fact they are attentive, taking in the tiniest details,” says Justin. Although the stories were planned for five minutes each, parents suggested the duration be increased so that children fall asleep as they listened. This meant packing more content without changing the original storyline. “For example, in the story of the Fox and Grapes, we said the fox was a kid, who went out to play without footwear. We brought in, organically, relatable elements for children. The narration is deliberately slow so that children can visualise the scenes. We encourage active listening as opposed to passive listening which happens, for instance, when they watch television,” Rakesh says.
 The interactive content encourages listeners to repeat after LaLa, and stories are so structured that nuggets of information are provided — new words, what consists healthy behaviours/good manners. Children are asked to do activities such as drawing pictures or sing, videos of which are uploaded on their Instagram handle. While LaLa is a woman, there is a male character called NaNa. Actor Aju Varghese has lent his voice to this character, for three stories.
 “We chose these names as our target audience comprises three to seven-year- olds, and NaNa and Lala are easy to pronounce. When NaNa (Aju) narrated the stories, a lot of kids related his voice to their father’s. Aju has been supportive of this venture,” Justin says.
 Justin and Rakesh have got interesting feedback, mostly from Malayalis who live outside Kerala and overseas. “Since the narration is in Malayalam, parents say their children’s pronunciation is getting better and they are picking up the language,” says Justin.
 Reduced or no screen-time aside, there is another angle to their project. “This way, parents can spend time with their children. At the end of the day, all a child wants is to be with his parents and this is one way to do that without the usual distractions of technology,” Rakesh says.

Trump’s standing in the polls over 2020 has tracked only slightly above where Carter spent much of the 1980 election year, as he battled inflation, high unemployment and the Iran hostage crisis. But what appeared a tight race on paper as late as October turned into a rout. Even Democratic heavyweights like Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh and South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, once a presidential nominee, fell.
