LONDON — Darrin McWhorter’s North Laurel Jaguars had high expectations this spring, but never got a chance to build on last year’s 17 wins due to the COVID-19 pandemic forcing the Kentucky High School Athletic Association to cancel the 2020 spring sports season.
 ”We all have a sadness and the feeling of loss to say the least,” McWhorter said. “I do think this team could have made a run in the 13th Region tournament. We had the pitching and enough experience to be in the mix when it was all said and done. This would have been my 20th season as head coach at North Laurel and I was excited to see how this season and this team stacked up against the past 19 teams.”
 McWhorter returned a roster full of talent that included two seniors, seven juniors, nine sophomores, and eight freshmen which gave him hopes of his team competing for the 49th District and 13th Region championships.
 ”I thought we had a team that would contend for the 49th District and 13th Region championships,” he said. “We had the pitching and returning players to make a run.

BULLHEAD CITY — More than two years ago, Bullhead City resident Nadina Angulo was on maternity leave from a job.
 Instead of returning to that position, she ended up in a more fulfilling and rewarding role.
 “I was sort of thrown into this,” she said in reference to becoming the family liaison for three schools within the Colorado River Union High School District.
 Angola’s program for students operates under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, which requires every district to have a “homeless” representative to protect youths and their families.
 “I’ve always wanted to help the community, and my job fits that niche,” said Angulo, who is 36 weeks pregnant — a fact that hasn’t stopped the working mother from enrolling students from Mohave High School, River Valley High School and CRUHSD Academy.
 To qualify for the program’s donations, a student must have a “temporary” living arrangement; for instance, if one’s house burned down and he or she must live in a hotel, the student would meet the criteria. Similarly, a student would qualify for Angulo’s aid if his or her family couldn’t pay bills or afford their mortgage.
 However, there is no minimum-income requirement.
 “Students who need help aren’t always easy to identify,” she said. “Sometimes I don’t specify why I’m talking to them, because I don’t want anyone to fall under a stigma.”
 In addition to asking questions of students, Angulo explains the program’s benefits and arrangements — but “can’t force them” to accept assistance, if they’re embarrassed or too proud.
 Although district funding helps with various products for the homeless fund, Angulo accepts monetary donations, gifts cards and school uniforms. She said there are restrictions that limit donation amounts for each item.
 If this endeavor sounds like a handful, especially for someone who’s expected to give birth June 3, be assured Angulo doesn’t go it alone.
 Grace Hecht, founder of Make Bullhead Better, reached out to Angulo about the children.

Since schools have been closed for two months to help slow the spread of COVID-19, life has gotten worse for some students.
 “School might have been their only stability,” said Hecht, who encouraged people to follow her on Facebook via #MakeBullheadBetter.
 To that end, Hecht asked her friend Anne Marie Ward — a candidate for Arizona’s 4th Congressional District — to pitch in. On Friday, Ward lent a hand with packaging hygiene kits and toiletries for students in need.
 “People are unaware that we have homeless youth,” Hecht said, explaining why she shot a video of Angulo and posted it on social media. “But so many people are stepping up now.”
 Among those lending a hand: local dentist Mark White donated toothpaste and toothbrushes; Janelle Summerlin of Desert Lawn Funeral Arrangement & Advanced Planning Center offered feminine hygiene products; the “Good Samaritan” team of Hope United Methodist Church supplied gift cards and school uniforms; while Hecht contributed such supplies as shampoo, laundry detergent, razors, deodorant and all-important toilet paper.
 Monetary donations can be made, Angulo said, by writing a check to the district; just be sure to specify which school you’re supporting.
 She said she plans to launch a new Facebook page in July, in time for the schools’ next semester.
 “There’s a need for uniforms at Mohave and River Valley High schools,” she said.
 There are 36 students in Angulo’s program, though she is seeking only what’s necessary for the time being. “Not every kid needs help at the same time.”
 Ultimately, she said, she wanted to express gratitude for all the cooperation.
 “I’m so appreciative. This community has been helping for years. I couldn’t do what I do without them,” she added.
 Anybody interested in helping may contact Angulo through Facebook or by email at nangulo-hielscher@crsk12.org

The decision of the present government to retire prematurely civil servants for corruption is problematic for a number of reasons. While there is no doubt that corruption among the bureaucracy is rife, and while there is no smoke without fire, premature retirement is obviously a penalty, and as there is no opportunity given to the officer concerned to defend himself or even hear the charges against him, there is no indication of the criteria on which such retirements are to be carried out. Another is the failure to indicate who the persons are whose recommendations are to be carried out, and thus there is no information on how they are to be vetted.

Other states that have emergency immunity measures are Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts; Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, Nevada, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.
 Their provisions vary but largely apply to injuries, deaths and care decisions, sometimes even to property damage. But there are limitations: Most make exceptions for gross negligence and willful misconduct.
 Toby Edelman of the Center for Medicare Advocacy said immunity declarations could make even gross or willful negligence suits harder since homes could argue any deficiencies were somehow tied to the pandemic.
 “Everything can’t be blamed on COVID-19. Other things can happen that are terrible,” she said. “Just to say we’re in this pandemic so anything goes, that seems too far.”
 All the new immunity laws notwithstanding, there is a potential wave of lawsuits coming. Illinois lawyer Steven Levin said he’s received dozens of calls from people considering suing homes over the outbreak. And a lawyer in Massachusetts said he’s gotten maybe 70 from families with relatives at homes struck by the virus.
 “We’re getting inundated,” said David Hoey, whose practice near Boston has been suing homes for 25 years. “They’re grieving and they’re confused. … ‘My loved one just died from COVID. What can I do?’”
 American Health Care Association CEO Mark Parkinson said the notion of lawyers gearing up for lawsuits now is “pathetic.”
 “These lawsuits are distracting facilities from being able to focus on taking care of people," he said. "We are in the middle of a battle right now.”

The coronavirus has thrown the ordinary world out of whack. So it is no surprise that it has seriously impacted investors. But apart from the already visible effects to investors, the most striking changes, although still uncertain, may be yet to come. So what can an investor do, if anything, to prepare?
 The stock market has been acting like a yo-yo, almost enough to drive one crazy. Some current investors might conclude they should sell, or at least lighten up, while more aggressive types are perhaps licking their chops at what they consider great buying opportunities. Of course, it all likely depends primarily on your goals as an investor: For avoiding worry and possibly sleeping better at night, you might want to sell some stock; for planning on perhaps making an easy profit on funds that haven't been this low in years, you might want to buy some.
 But these drivers of such actions probably reflect more of a narrow, short- term perspective. Over the longer-term, if you can maintain the same patient outlook you might have had prior to the crisis, you may not be impelled to do anything right now. Thus, waiting for stocks to return their more normal ways, that is variable but not heart-poundingly so, as they inevitably will, is probably the best course of action for most.
 Would the same relatively unchanged strategy apply when considering bond fund investments? Here things may suggest a somewhat more modified approach.
 For many bond investors, bonds can serve as a ballast to your stock investments. According to the dictionary, a _ballast_ is something that helps you to succeed, especially by keeping the overall circumstance under control.

Adding an adult child to your house deed, or giving them the home outright, might seem like a smart thing to do. It usually isn't.
 Transferring your house to your kids while you're alive may avoid probate, the court process that otherwise follows death. But gifting a home also can result in a big, unnecessary tax bill and put your house at risk if your kids get sued or file for bankruptcy. You also could be making a big mistake if you hope it will help keep the house from being consumed by nursing home bills.
 There are better ways to transfer a house to your kids, as well as a little- known potential fix that may help even if the giver has since died.
 WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GIFT A HOUSE
 If you bequeath a house to your kids -- which means they get it after your death -- they also get what's known as a "step-up in tax basis." All the appreciation that happened while you owned the house is never taxed.
 Certified financial planner Kenneth Robinson of Rocky River, Ohio, says last year he advised a client not to let his mom give him her house. The mother paid $16,000 for her home in 1976, while the current market value is close to $200,000. None of that gain would be taxable if the son inherited the house, Robinson told his client.
 The mother signed a quit claim to give her son the house anyway and died shortly afterward. That potentially meant a tax bill of about $32,000 for Robinson's client.
 Families who realize the mistake in time can undo the damage by gifting the house back to the parent, says Jennifer Sawday, a partner at TLD Law in Long Beach, California.
 "We do last-minute deeds to get that house back in place when we know someone is dying," Sawday says.
 OTHER REASONS NOT TO GIFT A HOUSE
 Sometimes people transfer a home to try to qualify for Medicaid, the government program that pays health care and nursing home bills for the indigent. But gifts or transfers made within five years of applying for Medicaid can lead to a penalty period, when seniors are disqualified from receiving benefits.
 Transferring your home to someone else also can expose you to their financial problems. Their creditors could file liens on your home and, depending on state law, get some or most of its value. In a divorce, the house could become an asset that must be divided.
 A POTENTIAL 'HAIL MARY' FIX
 Robinson consulted a certified public accountant and an estate planning attorney. Both said what Robinson feared was true: The client was stuck paying taxes on the $184,000 gain in value since his mother bought the property.
 "They were as discouraged as I was," Robinson says.
 But then Robinson hired a tax research firm and learned of a workaround. Section 2036 of the Internal Revenue Code says that if the mother retained a "life interest" in the property, which includes the right to continue living there, the home would remain in her estate rather than be considered a completed gift.
 "Many people do not know about this and are therefore losing out on the step- up and the lower taxes they would be entitled to," says Michael Eisenberg, CPA financial planner with the American Institute of CPAs' Financial Literacy Commission.
 There are specific rules for what constitutes a life interest, including the power to determine what happens to the property and liability for its bills. To ensure that outcome, the son, as executor of his mother's estate, filed a gift tax return on her behalf to show that he was given a "remainder interest," or the right to inherit when his mother's life interest expired at her death, Robinson says.
 THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO TRANSFER A HOUSE
 There are other ways around probate. Many states and the District of Columbia allow "transfer on death" deeds that allow people to leave their beneficiaries their houses without having to go through probate. Another option is a living trust, which typically costs $1,500 to $3,000 to set up but can ensure all a person's assets avoid probate.
 And probate in many states is nothing to fear. Most states have simplified probate procedures for smaller estates. Only in a few, such as California and Florida, is probate so expensive and time-consuming that most people should try to avoid it.
 "We see avoidance of probate as a big issue in people's minds, sometimes bigger than it has to be," Robinson says.


--DocBreak--
Now the industry is forging ahead with a campaign to get other states on board with a simple argument: This was an unprecedented crisis and nursing homes should not be liable for events beyond their control, such as shortages of protective equipment and testing, shifting directives from authorities, and sicknesses that have decimated staffs.

SAUGATUCK -- With the Kalamazoo River spilling over into the streets of Saugatuck again this week, business owners and residents in Saugatuck are worried about what a serious storm surge would do to their properties.
   
 Rains Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday caused flooding at the river's edge, which closed down the intersection of Lucy and Water streets. Floodwaters covered the west end of Spear Street and the south end of Butler Street and threatened businesses on the river's edge, like The River Market on Water Street.
   
 Owner Jim Bieke told The Sentinel a line of sandbags around his building kept his business dry this time, but he wasn't so lucky last fall.
   
 "The same thing happened over the Thanksgiving holiday and my store was completely flooded," Bieke said. "I had 17 inches of water in the back and about 5 inches out in front."
   
 That flood, the day before Thanksgiving, took out many of the store's appliances, including the furnace.
   
 "Another flood would be devastating," chef and restaurant owner Eric Chaitan told Saugatuck City Council on Thursday.
   
 Chaitan said the Thanksgiving flood's damage to his riverside businesses was extensive and costly, and he's spent tens of thousands on preventative measures since.
   
 "If that happens again, we'll certainly be closed for this season and, candidly, I don't know that we'll recover from it," Chaitan told the council.
   
 In a meeting Monday, the Saugatuck City Council prioritized taking action at the intersection of Lucy and Water streets, which has seen persistent flooding problems. Several businesses and homes are located at the intersection.
   
 "This is the most difficult situation we have right now," Council member Barry Johnson said.
   
 The council voted to use a Hesco flood barrier, a container made up of heavy duty fabric and collapsible mesh wire filled with sand, and install a pumping system at the flooding site. The cost is expected to be between $11,000 and $13,000.
   
 At another special meeting Thursday to discuss the flooding, the city council voted to prioritize taking action at:
       The end of Spear Street   The south end of Butler Street   The Wicks Park restroom     
 The council also voted to purchase a quick-fill sandbag machine, expected to cost about $4,600.
   
 The city asked consultant Edgewater Resources to look at flooding sites in the city and develop a range of mitigation strategies for each. The strategies range from several thousands of dollars for Hesco barrier and pump solutions to the hundreds of thousands for stormwater lift stations.
   
 Saugatuck only has $20,000 earmarked this year for flood mitigation, but the council expects to overspend that budget to tackle these projects in preparation for more flooding throughout the season.
   
 "I think we all know $20,000 isn't going to hack it," said Council member Mark Bekken.
   
 Saugatuck City Manager Kirk Harrier said the city may be able to use road millage funds for street flooding issues.
   
 Council member Holly Leo wondered aloud how bad the flooding could be if Saugatuck were to see a major storm surge.
   
 "The weather we've experienced the last 48 hours is a fairly minor event. We didn't really have the wind and we don't have the water heights that we're going to have in a month or two, so I just think we really have to keep that in mind," she said.
   
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has predicted record-high water levels on Lake Michigan this spring and summer.
   
 "It's really hard to know what to expect moving forward," said Scott Herbert, Saugatuck's Department of Public Works director, who surveyed the flooded areas this week. "Back by Thanksgiving we had a storm surge of a foot and a half, two foot. If that happened now, that would be devastating."
   
 "We're not going to be able to stop these events from happening, but we can reduce the impact that these events do have when they occur," Herbert said.
   
 Chaitan pushed the council to consider investing even more in flooding prevention.
   
 "I urge you all to look at sort of the ROI (return on investment) to the town on the investment versus what the loss would be with those businesses gone," Chaitan said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Faced with 20,000 coronavirus deaths and counting, the nation’s nursing homes are pushing back against a potential flood of lawsuits with a sweeping lobbying effort to get states to grant them emergency protection from claims of inadequate care.
 At least 15 states have enacted laws or governors’ orders that explicitly or apparently provide nursing homes and long-term care facilities some protection from lawsuits arising from the crisis. And in the case of New York, which leads the nation in deaths in such facilities, a lobbying group wrote the first draft of a measure that apparently makes it the only state with specific protection from both civil lawsuits and criminal prosecution.
 Now the industry is forging ahead with a campaign to get other states on board with a simple argument: This was an unprecedented crisis and nursing homes should not be liable for events beyond their control, such as shortages of protective equipment and testing, shifting directives from authorities, and sicknesses that have decimated staffs.
 “As our care providers make these difficult decisions, they need to know they will not be prosecuted or persecuted,” read a letter sent this month from several major hospital and nursing home groups to their next big goal, California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has yet to make a decision. Other states in their sights include Florida, Pennsylvania and Missouri.
 Watchdogs, patient advocates and lawyers argue that immunity orders are misguided. At a time when the crisis is laying bare such chronic industry problems as staffing shortages and poor infection control, they say legal liability is the last safety net to keep facilities accountable.
 They also contend nursing homes are taking advantage of the crisis to protect their bottom lines. Almost 70% of the nation’s more than 15,000 nursing homes are run by for-profit companies, and hundreds have been bought and sold in recent years by private-equity firms.

Chandigarh, May 3 (PTI) A war of words erupted between Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia on Sunday as the state's coronavirus count crossed 1,000 with over 600 Sikh pilgrims returning from Maharshtra's Nanded testing positive for the infection.
 While Majithia accused the state government of "mismanaging" the return of the pilgrims from the Nanded's Hazur Sahib gurdwara and sought the minister's sacking, Sidhu hit back at the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), daring its leaders to apologise for their "misleading propaganda".
 So far, 609 of the 4,000 pilgrims who recently returned from Nanded have tested positive for coronavirus.
 Health Minister Sidhu in a statement here said the pilgrims contracted the disease before entering Punjab while stressing that 'sewadars' of the gurdwara have also tested positive for the virus.
 Religious leaders have testified that Nanded pilgrims were tested in Maharashtra but the Punjab government did not receive any test report from the state government till now, said Sidhu, who is under fire from the Opposition.
 Lashing out at SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and former state minister Bikram Singh Majithia, Sidhu accused them of "indulging in political one-upmanship" over a sensitive issue, that too "without verifying facts".
 "These leaders unnecessarily hyped this issue by spreading this propaganda that pilgrims are being labelled as coronavirus positive as part of a conspiracy," said Sidhu.
 By politicising this issue, Akali leaders were not only trying to demoralise all frontline warriors who are going beyond their call of duty to save Punjab but also giving false and fabricated comments over such a sensitive issue, Sidhu alleged.
 Sidhu said there is no need to worry or panic after the spike in cases with the return of pilgrims.
 He said the pilgrims have been given the best treatment and also assured that the state will recover from the challenge just as it did first from situations arising out of the return of foreigners and then Tablighi Jamaat members.
 Meanwhile, Majithia asked Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to sack Sidhu from the cabinet.
 Majithia alleged that Sidhu had started defaming the pilgrims by stating that they had spoiled all the good work done by the Punjab government in controlling COVID-19.
 Stating that the "good work" of the Health Department has already been exposed by health workers who had "failed" to get PPE kits and facilities like ambulances and ventilators, the Akali leader said Sidhu has proven to be "utterly incompetent" and should quit his post immediately.
 Majithia claimed that it was a fact that the Punjab government did not follow the ICMR guidelines while repatriating the pilgrims.
 He said air-conditioned buses were used against established norms.
 "Social distancing was not followed. The buses came through red zones and it was because of this mishandling that pilgrims, who were in good health in Nanded for more than one month, tested positive for COVID-19 on their return to Punjab", claimed Majithia.
 He said this had also been borne out by the statement of Congress minister from Maharashtra Ashok Chavan who blamed the Punjab government for the plight of the pilgrims.
 Majithia said the Congress-led government had first targeted NRIs and was now targeting Sikhs.
 "If the state government commits mistakes in repatriation by mishandling the operation, it should not try to put the blame on others," he said.
 He also sought from the Punjab government to shift the pilgrims to the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee 'sarais' for quarantine purposes.
 He claimed that the pilgrims from Nanded have been quarantined in unhygienic government facilities.

We are now engaged in a torturous social experiment. But unlike the great influenza of 1918, we have tools to address a part of the hurt from social distancing. Communications channels such as Google Hangout, Slack, Zoom and other software applications, some as simple as FaceTime — for whose ease of use and efficacy alone Steve Jobs should be a fifth Beatle — enable not just businesses to maintain workflow, but far-flung families and friends to sit together at a virtual table.
 These tools have demonstrated their productivity. I was struck by a message from our son Jesse, as he suffered through pneumonia in Seattle, who noted that working from home “means we all spend more hours in the day working.” A great antidote for those who question telework. When we come out of this, many will adjust where and how we work.
 Turning back the clock to a bleak March day in 1933, in the depths of the Great Depression, a man with the disability of polio was helped to the podium surreptitiously so as to reveal no sign of weakness to a nation in dire need of emotional support. When he addressed tens of millions of Americans via the several radio networks whose ubiquity would usher in an era of reassuring “fireside chats,” FDR’s first inaugural address said it all: “We have nothing to fear but fear itself.”
 For many American workers, we know that these times will be especially hard, and telework may not be applicable. Families will remain apart. Yet people can create online hangouts, and while that is no substitute for work or togetherness, it may be a lifeline for connection.
 Had the global pandemic appeared even a few short years ago, we would not have had the tools to see each other face to face across the miles. Lonely as we feel now, we would have been lonelier still. The screen is a pale solace, but better than nothing. What one picture is worth.
 FDR had it right. Fear is the enemy.

 "It's exactly what you'd expect and hope for from the arts community," Missouri Arts Council Executive Director Michael Donovan.
   
 Donovan has been inspired and encouraged by the response of Missouri artists and arts organizations as COVID-19 shutters venues and keeps audiences home. MAC has been keeping tabs on the artists and communities within its reach while quite literally counting the cost of the pandemic.
   
 In the middle of a rapidly-changing environment, Donovan spoke with the Tribune April 21, discussing several topics of interest to artists and art lovers.
   
 At a loss
   
 Budget restrictions introduced by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson April 1 effectively wiped out MAC's fourth-quarter funding to the tune of nearly $1.2 million dollars. MAC reduced or eliminated "any unnecessary expense," Donovan said, then placed restrictions on outstanding grant monies.
   
 A large portion of MAC grants are committed early in the fiscal year, Donovan said. Organizations which already received their full award went untouched. Those still expecting the rest of their grant were paid a smaller, proportional amount, he said. MAC paid out a little less than half of remaining grant balances to most groups.
   
 "That seemed the fairest way to share the pain of those restrictions," Donovan added.
   
 A second round of restrictions later in the month passed over MAC, but Donovan expects the state to take a rigorous approach to its fiscal year 2021 disbursement. Some relief is on the way in the form of CARES Act funds; MAC will receive more than $468,000. It will keep $50,000 and distribute the rest to Missouri arts organizations "as quickly as possible," Donovan said.
   
 MAC currently awaits spending authority from the state to disburse these funds; this leeway should come no later than July 1, the beginning of the next fiscal year, he said.
   
 Necessary changes
   
 Approximately 13% of MAC's budget comes from the National Endowment for the Arts. The NEA not only kept its financial promises, but loosened restrictions on how that money could be spent. This allowed MAC to make an important pivot: project grants awarded to Missouri arts groups could be spent on operating costs during this tenuous time.
   
 MAC is one of many arts groups considering how it will emerge different on the other side of this pandemic; it has already participated in conversations with regional and national arts consortiums, Donovan said. While much of that conversation still resides in the realm of speculation, this immediate change in grant usage will ripple out into the near future.
   
 Next fiscal year, MAC will award hybrid grants that can be used on projects and/or operating support. Currently, operating support grants typically go to larger organizations. In future years, MAC will consider how to more equitably distribute grants, Donovan said, increasing flexibility and availability for smaller groups.
   
 The mother of invention
   
 For survival's sake, Missouri arts organizations have responded creatively to this public health crisis. Donovan and MAC bear witness that groups are considering methods of outreach and measuring their community impact in fresh ways. However and whenever traditional venues reopen, Donovan believes this sort of innovation will become permanent.
   
 For all the burden of this time, he has enjoyed experiencing performances from around the state of Missouri in the friendly confines of home.
   
 "That excites me. The idea that that might continue as an outcome of this -- that would be one of the little silver linings, if that's possible," Donovan said. "To know that I could be able to go virtually to theaters throughout the state, throughout the country, in a way that I never could before."

 All the 20 districts are in the red zone.
 The ministry has listed 130 districts in the country in 'red' zone, 284 in 'orange' zone and 319 in 'green' zone on the basis of incidence of cases of COVID-19, doubling rate, extent of testing and surveillance feedback.
 This classification of districts is to be followed by states and UTs till a week post May 3 for containment operations.
 The list will be revised on a weekly basis or earlier and communicated to states for further follow-up action.
 India registered a record jump of 83 deaths and 2,487 cases in 24 hours as the number of COVID-19 fatalities rose to 1,306 and total cases climbed to 40,263 on Sunday, according to the Union health ministry.
 The number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 28,070, while 10,886 people have recovered and one patient has migrated, it said. The total number of cases also include 111 foreign nationals.
 According to the health ministry data updated in the evening, the highest number of confirmed cases in the country is from Maharashtra at 12,296, followed by Gujarat (5,055), Delhi (4,122),Madhya Pradesh (2,846), Rajasthan (2,772), Tamil Nadu (2,757) and Uttar Pradesh (2,626).

David Golden’s writing is often messy, and sometimes you have to go back and forth (an advantage in streaming platforms like Netflix) to get a grip on the plot.

While Mendes adds a dash of innocence to her character — and she is the only one for whom the title does not hold true — she is somewhat wooden, failing to convey the shocks and surprises which topple her every now and then. Usher is just passable, but Chung is quite a disaster, underlining the fact that while there is a pressing need for home entertainment in this period of lockdown, platforms like Netflix must tread carefully not to ruin their reputations.

 I'm making my third and hopefully final trip to the basement with my Carhartts, stocking cap and winter gloves. Maybe they'll stay down there this time, since I've been trying to store them away since the first of March, when it was 60 degrees.
 Just two weeks ago, I mowed on Friday evening, dressed like an Eskimo, and by Sunday afternoon I finished the job in shorts and a T-shirt. Why would you want to live anywhere else - when you can experience all four seasons in just one weekend? Besides, being all spread out like we are has proven to be a great deterrent from the germ we're all trying to avoid.
 The job of helping to run two businesses keeps me plenty busy, although, the flexibility allows me time to work on outdoor chores as well. There's only one thing that is troubling and only happens when I pass by a mirror.
 Since I don't have the daily interaction with co-workers, or the public, the usual routine of fixing my hair and putting on makeup has been replaced with donning a ponytail, jean shorts and T-shirt. I've cut my fingernails so I can dig in the dirt more easily, and the pedicures have been wiped away from the COVID. If I didn't know better, I'd say I've turned into a full-fledged farmer while pretending to work a full-time job, and I love every minute of it.
 When I was little, Mom laughed when I said I wanted to be a farmer when I grew up. Maybe she knew something I didn't. The best thing about turning 60 is you can finally evolve into who you want to be, as the time has now passed being concerned with fashion, it's all about comfort.
 I see my daughters cringe when I wear headbands and bandanas and think it's crazy how much I wear my bib overalls, but it's a wonderful thing when you finally feel comfortable in your own skin and in clothing that makes you happy. Besides, the chance to embarrass your kids never gets old.
 Maybe he's just being polite, but when I come in with dirt smudges from head to toe, he says I've never looked better. There's something to be said about complimenting a woman who knows darn well she doesn't look her best. Flattery goes a long way, especially when you're so far over the hill there's no amount of back-pedaling to turn back time. Sometimes our entire conversations are based on what aches and pains we have and who is the most tired.
 I had all intentions of surprising him by getting spruced up, throwing on some makeup and looking presentable just to go no further than the front room, when he asked if I was up for an evening of fishing.
 Thank goodness he prefers my fishing boots to high heels, as I'll choose a rod and reel over a curling iron any day.

I'm making my third and hopefully final trip to the basement with my Carhartts, stocking cap and winter gloves. Maybe they'll stay down there this time, since I've been trying to store them away since the first of March, when it was 60 degrees.
   
 Just two weeks ago, I mowed on Friday evening, dressed like an Eskimo, and by Sunday afternoon I finished the job in shorts and a T-shirt. Why would you want to live anywhere else - when you can experience all four seasons in just one weekend? Besides, being all spread out like we are has proven to be a great deterrent from the germ we're all trying to avoid.
   
 The job of helping to run two businesses keeps me plenty busy, although, the flexibility allows me time to work on outdoor chores as well. There's only one thing that is troubling and only happens when I pass by a mirror.
   
 Since I don't have the daily interaction with co-workers, or the public, the usual routine of fixing my hair and putting on makeup has been replaced with donning a ponytail, jean shorts and T-shirt. I've cut my fingernails so I can dig in the dirt more easily, and the pedicures have been wiped away from the COVID. If I didn't know better, I'd say I've turned into a full-fledged farmer while pretending to work a full-time job, and I love every minute of it.
