Despite the private admissions, there has been no public effort to nudge Trump toward the exit.
 Trump has declined to concede the presidential race and is mounting legal fights in several states, but there has been no indication or evidence of voter irregularities or widespread fraud in the election. The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration has held off on formally beginning the Biden transition to the White House, slowing the incoming administration's ability to prepare to grapple with a worsening pandemic that has already killed 250,000 Americans.
 Trump's refusal to accept the results means the election disputes could drag on for weeks as states certify their tallies or push to mid-December, when the Electoral College is set to vote. And baseless claims about election fraud have filled conservative media without any rebuttal from Republicans, potentially undermining the Biden presidency before it even begins.
 A Monmouth University poll released Wednesday showed that while 95% of Democrats believe the election was "fair and square," only 18% of Republicans do, while 70% of GOP voters believe some voter fraud took place.
 A sense of paralysis has set in at the White House.
 The West Wing has been hollowed out, with staffers quarantining after COVID-19 exposures and others actively looking for new jobs. The president has remained in the Oval Office well into the night but has stayed out of the public eye, tweeting baseless claims while largely giving up on governing and not taking a single question from a reporter since Election Day.
 Republicans have said privately there's not much they can do except wait, giving the president the time and space he needs to see the results for himself. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, perceived by some Republicans as the one man who could urge Trump to cooperate with the Biden transition, has instead steadfastly backed the president, saying he's "100% within his rights" to legally contest the results.
 GOP lawmakers have pointed to the more than 70 million votes that Trump garnered as well as his overwhelming popularity with Republicans, including among their respective bases of support back home. The chatter that Trump is already eyeing a 2024 campaign has also frozen Republicans wary of his Twitter account, and they have also expressed fear that being perceived as forcing the president to the exit may trigger the temperamental chief executive to make further risky decisions, such as troop drawdowns or more dismissals on the national security staff.
 And, of course, there is Georgia.
 Republicans need to win one of the two runoff elections set for January in the state in order to hang onto their Senate majority and prevent a Democratic sweep of Washington. Although Trump has not yet signaled much interest in helping with the races, Republicans have made the calculation that keeping his base fired up may be their best chance to secure a victory in a state where Biden has a narrow lead. (The Associated Press has not yet called that race.)
 "Trump is behaving exactly as everyone should have expected he would do. Nothing he has done in the last two weeks is out of character," said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who advised Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential bid. "And Senate Republicans are responding to him the same way they always do: Ignore him and focus on the Senate calendar."
 "But there's no guarantee this works out well for Republicans."

It's a really good question. And I think we're trying to clarify is that the colocation we talked about on a small cell system is actually collocating on the fiber. So as long as we put another small cell on an existing amount of fiber that is colocation, because about 80% of the capital goes into the fiber. And it's not the fiber itself, it's actually digging up the street, burying the fiber and putting the street back again. And 80% of our capital goes into that fiber build process. So as long as we can utilize that fiber over and over and over again, that's what we're collocated on. Now, it is obviously better if we can go on a same pole colocation because that reduces our cost of the incremental colocation. But when we talk about colocation economics, have a mix of same pole colocation where we actually put another customer on the existing infrastructure, vertical infrastructure, not well defined [ph]. What we would call next pullover [ph], which is at your point, Simon, going 50 meters down the road where we already have fiber. Or what we would call a very small ladder, where we have to build a little tiny bit of fiber off the backbone we have, that mix is the colocation we would speak of. And it is not always easy to collocate on the same pole, there are restrictions that cities put up on the size of equipment that can go on any one pole, they typically limit it, for the most part to about two customers per pole. So we can have two nodes on a single pole, but sometimes it's more and sometimes it's less, it really depends on the set.

Palmer reiterated that concern Tuesday night, noting that — if read literally — the city’s animal control officer would be tasked with chasing squirrels and woodchucks, in addition to cats.
 “Maybe we shouldn’t touch this section at all,” she said.
 That would have been the easy way out. Instead Boutin renewed his proposed “Egyptian god” language and Mayor Lucas Herring suggested making reference to “owned animals” to get squirrels, woodchucks and other wildlife off the hook.
 Herring’s change survived and Boutin’s did not, capping a dizzying discussion that prompted City Manager Steve Mackenzie to seek clarification before councilors voted on a motion they’d just amended to reflect those changes.
 “I apologize for having difficulty following the bouncing ball, but is the exemption for cats in or out?” he asked.
 The short answer was “in,” which means cats can be out, but Boutin supplied a longer one.
 “Any cat, whether owned or unowned, is allowed to run willy-nilly throughout the city,” he said.
 The motion passed, 4-3, with Herring snapping a 3-3 tie and joining Councilors John Steinman, Teddy Waszazak and Rich Morey, in a slim majority.
 Boutin was among the dissenters — because he liked his language better. Councilors Jake Hemmerick and Ericka Reil voted “no,” as well.
 Now the council is one public hearing away from adopting the proposed amendment, which — barring another substantive change — could happen next week.

 The move, explained in a email sent to athletic directors Tuesday, came a day after CIAC members received a plan that proposed a Dec. 5 start date for boys and girls basketball, boys swimming and hockey practice while delaying other sports including wrestling until the New Year.
 But that plan also strongly encouraged but did not mandate schools in towns in the state’s red category (15-plus positive COVID cases per 100,000 people) to not play games. Almost two-thirds of the state’s 169 towns are in the red category.

Then all eyes turn to statewide certification.
 In Wayne County, the two Republican canvassers at first balked at certifying the vote and then reversed course after widespread condemnation -- but not before Trump praised their actions. A person familiar with the matter said Trump reached out to the canvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, on Tuesday evening after the revised vote to express gratitude for their support.
 Time is running short for Trump. Across the nation, recounts and court challenges must wrap up and election results must be certified by Dec. 8. That's the constitutional deadline ahead of the Electoral College meeting the following week.
 Matt Morgan, the Trump campaign's general counsel, said last week the campaign was trying to halt certification in battleground states until it could get a better handle on vote tallies and whether it would have the right to automatic recounts. Right now, Trump is requesting a recount in Wisconsin in two counties, and Georgia is doing an hand audit after Biden led by a slim margin of 0.3 percentage points, but there is no mandatory recount law in the state. The law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points.
 Some in the president's orbit have held out hope that by delaying certification, GOP-controlled state legislatures will get a chance to select different electors, either overturning Biden's victory or sending it to the House, where Trump would almost surely win.
 But most advisers to the president consider that a fever dream. Trump's team has been incapable of organizing even basic legal activities since the election, let alone the widescale political and legal apparatus needed to persuade state legislators to try to undermine the will of their states' voters.
 Lawsuits have been filed by Trump allies in Michigan and Nevada seeking to stop certification. Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani argued to stop vote certification in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, the first time he'd been in a courtroom in decades. And the same day, the Arizona Republican Party asked a judge to bar Maricopa County, the state's most populous, from certifying until the court issues a decision about the party's lawsuit seeking a new hand count of a sampling of ballots.
 The party is also putting pressure on county officials across the state to delay certification, even though there hasn't been any evidence of legitimate questions about the vote tally showing that Biden won Arizona.
 "The party is pushing for not only the county supervisors but everyone responsible for certifying and canvassing the election to make sure that all questions are answered so that voters will have confidence in the results of the election," said Zach Henry, spokesman for the Arizona Republican Party.
 While most counties in Arizona are pressing ahead with certification, officials in Mohave County decided to delay until Nov. 23, citing what they said was uncertainty about the fate of election challenges across the country.
 "There are lawsuits all over the place on everything, and that's part of the reason why I'm in no big hurry to canvass the election," Mohave County Supervisor Ron Gould said Monday.
 Officials in all of Georgia's 159 counties were supposed to have certified their results by last Friday. But a few have yet to certify as the state works through a hand tally of some 5 million votes.
 "They are overwhelmed, and they are trying to get to everything," said Gabriel Sterling, a top official with the Georgia Secretary of State's Office. "Some of these are smaller, less resourced counties, and there are only so many people who can do so many things."
 In addition, a few counties must recertify their results after previously uncounted votes were discovered during the audit.
 Once counties have certified, the focus turns to officials at the state level who are charged with signing off on the election. This varies by state. For instance, a bipartisan panel in Michigan certifies elections, but in Georgia it's the responsibility of the elected secretary of state, who has already faced calls by fellow Republicans to resign.
 In Nevada, Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske's role in certification is largely ministerial, but she still got a batch of emails urging her not to certify "potentially fraudulent election results," a spokeswoman said Wednesday. The Justice Department had been looking into one potential case of fraud in the state over voter rolls, but an AP analysis found the case doesn't appear to hold much water.
 In Pennsylvania's Luzerne County, a Republican board member, Joyce Dombroski- Gebhardt, said she will not certify the county's election without an audit of at least 10% of the votes to ensure that some voters did not vote twice.
 Trump won the county, where the election board is made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. A Democrat on the board, Peter Oullette, said he had no doubt that the rest of the board will sign the certification on Monday.
 Philadelphia also had plans to certify results on Monday.
 And some delays could still happen given the crushing workload election officials faced this year during the pandemic, according to Suzanne Almeida with Common Cause Pennsylvania, a good government group that helps with voter education and monitors election work in the state.
 "A delay in certification doesn't necessarily mean there are shenanigans; sometimes it just takes longer to go through all the mechanics to get to certification," Almeida said.

The collection of 49ers paraphernalia adorning the office of Chief Dean Capelletti, the new chief of police for the Oakley Police Department, reveals that he has deep roots in the Bay Area even though he spent his professional career to date in Southern California.
 Born in Stanford and raised in the Bay Area, Capelletti moved to the southern part of the state while in high school. Until a few weeks ago, we remained there, but family up north and 49ers season tickets kept him close to his roots.
 “Every Sunday morning, we’d drive up, watch the game and then drive back right after the game,” Capelletti said. “I usually had to work on Monday, or my wife did. That’s the type of diehard fans we are. I’ve always had that tie to Northern California. I technically lived in Los Angeles more than half my life, but I still consider myself a Bay Area guy. I always wanted to come back to the Bay Area.”
 Capelletti, the department’s third chief since Oakley formed its own police department in 2016, took the reins of the department at the end of September replacing the now-retired Chief Eric Christensen. Christensen held the job for two years before announcing his retirement in May.
 “Throughout the hiring process, we were looking primarily for an experienced candidate who we knew would care for the City of Oakley just like we do,” said City Manager Bryan Montgomery. “Chief Capelletti brings great energy and passion for the law enforcement profession and is very skilled in working at building relationships of trust, which is especially important in these unique and challenging times. I know Chief Capelletti will fully devote himself to the protection and service of the people of Oakley.”
 Capelletti’s path to a career in law enforcement followed an unusual route. Before entering the police academy, he was already married with children, a mortgage and a successful career in the private sector. The events of a clear fall morning in September 2001 triggered a change in his plans.
 “I watched 9/11 unfold, and something just called to me,” he explained. “I had to do something.”
 With the enthusiastic support of his wife, Capelletti, who was then 32 years old, put himself through the police academy. He continued working full time and spent 11 months attending academy classes on nights and weekends. After graduating, he was recruited by the La Habra Police Department and the Contra Costa County Office of the Sheriff.
 “I went to La Habra, basically, because they moved faster than the Contra Costa Sheriff,” Capelletti said. “Othewise, I might have been a CoCo sheriff.”
 In the intervening 18 years since starting at La Habra, Capelletti worked his way up to a senior captain title and was poised to be a strong candidate for the chief’s position there, which was expected to become available this year. Though he’s not sure how, his wife came across the open position at the OPD. The role checked all the boxes that Capelletti wanted in a chief’s role and provided the added opportunity to return to the Bay Area. Before he applied, he visited Oakley over the Fourth of July holiday.
 “Immediately when I got in the city I just felt like this was the right place for me,” he said. “The city felt vibrant. It felt alive. I loved all the greenery. I loved how open it was. It gave me that Mayberry feel.”
 Police agencies in East County often work closely together. Chief Tom Hansen of the Brentwood Police Department had a chance to sit down with the new chief over lunch. He came away impressed, noting Capelletti’s strong tactical and administrative background and his enthusiasm for the new role.
 “I think he’s going to bring some good ideas to the already well-run Oakley Police Department,” Hansen said. “I look forward to working with him in collaboration to better serve our East County citizens. We’re all on the same page that we can be better together, and we’re going to work on that.”
 Calling himself an optimist, Capelletti said he doesn’t see challenges, he sees opportunities. After less than two months on the job, he said that officers of the OPD are among the best he’s ever seen, and he’s looking forward to working with them and the city’s residents to shape the growth of the department.
 “The city is growing and I want to jump on that wave,” Capelletti said. “I want to be part of the growth of the city of Oakley. I want to be the one that leads the men and women of the police department to mirror what the community wants us to be. You don’t often get an opportunity to do that. That’s what drew me here.”

 This genius not only did the impossible, but did it invisibly. The governors and secretaries of state of forty nine of the fifty states, Republicans and Democrats alike. say they were able to find no evidence at all of widespread voter fraud. The little glitches they turned up here and there were nowhere near enough to affect the outcome. The one exception was the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, who actually offered a “bounty” to anyone who would come forward with evidence of election tampering. (In effect he was willing to pay a bribe for such evidence, which is pretty weird, to say the least.) As of this writing, I haven’t heard that he’s come up with anything.

 # Park Board approves bond issue
 Patrick Stout
 Voice Correspondent
 MACOMB — The park district board of commissioners this week approved the sale of $648,000 in general obligation park bonds. Board President Phil Weiss said Citizens Bank has purchased the bonds and the closing date is December 10.
 Park Director and Board Secretary Rachel Lenz said the district will pay 1.15 percent interest on the bonds. She said the interest on last year's bonds was two percent. Commissioner and District Treasurer Russ Hamm said last year's bonds were paid off on October 16.
 Hamm reported that the park district general fund ended October with $472,895. He said the consolidated fund closed the month with $95,840. The treasurer added that reduced days of activity caused a $15,000 budget deficit for the Ball Fore Family Entertainment Center and a $2,000 deficit for Lakeview Nature Center.
 Lenz reported that Friday's statewide Tier 3 coronavirus mitigation effort will result in the closure of the park district office until further notice. She said appointments can be made by telephone and that most staff members would work from home.
 The director said parks will remain open but restrooms will be closed. Lenz said some organized outdoor activities, such as tours at Lakeview Nature Center, will continue but must be arranged by appointment.
 Lenz said the park district is selling "Elf on the Shelf" kits and other at- home play kits for children.

But more importantly, our capital is coming down because the small cell backlog we have for 2021 is more weighted to colocation, where we already have assets in the ground, than it is to anchor builds where we're building assets from scratch. So our typical balance has been somewhere between 70% and 80% anchor build. And what we see going into 2021 is that that number is around 60% anchor build and 40% colocation, just because of the bookings we had that led up to the 21 installations for small cells, and that reduces the capital expenditure intensity of the business, because like I said, there's assets already in the ground and we're reutilizing that capital.

So the scale is really important, we believe, where our towers are, which are really concentrated in the top hundred markets in the US and as DISH is focused on deploying out to a population target, being in the top hundred markets in the US is really important.

But also important enough to put in a press release announcing the agreement, that because they're building a network from scratch, and because they want it to be a virtualized network where some of the equipment is not located directly at the tower site, that fiber is a necessity to making a network like that work.

The US, which has now registered 250,029 fatalities, has by far the highest national death toll, ahead of Brazil with 166,699 deaths, India with 130,993 deaths and Mexico with 99,026.
 President Donald Trump has consistently downplayed the threat of the virus, seldom wearing a mask and holding large, packed rallies while campaigning for the November 3 election that he lost to Joe Biden.
 Social distancing, mask wearing and other measures are followed unevenly in some parts of the US despite a surge in recent cases and deaths.
 The country now routinely records over 1,000 deaths and 150,000 new cases every day.
 New York City will again close public schools this week and has re-imposed some restrictions on bars and restaurants.
 Two trial vaccines have recently performed well in tests, offering hope for the US and world.
 The novel coronavirus has killed more than 1,343,000 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.

Un hombre acusado de presumiblemente abusar sexualmente de su sobrina, fue capturado por personal operativo de la Fiscalia General del Estado de San Luis Potosi (FGESLP), en virtud de existir una orden de aprehension. Los hechos se suscitaron en el municipio de Soledad de Graciano Sanchez. Todo ocurrio en el periodo de diciembre de 2019 y enero de 2020, cuando la menor se quedaba a cargo de su tio, por cuestiones laborales de su madre, por lo que el sujeto presuntamente aprovechaba los momentos a solas con la victima para realizarle tocamientos lascivos en el cuerpo de la niña de 9 años de edad. Ademas, el presunto supuestamente amenazaba a la afectada con que no contara nada de lo acontecido en el domicilio ubicado en la colonia Nueva Foresta, o de lo contrario le realizaria un daño. La Fiscalia Especializada en atencion a la Mujer, la Familia y Delitos Sexuales, tuvo conocimiento de este asunto, solicitando a los agentes de la Policia de Investigacion (PDI), realizaran las indagatorias correspondientes, logrando con ello, que la autoridad judicial librara un mandato por el delito de abuso sexual calificado en contra de Alfonso Rafael "N". Al señalado se le dio seguimiento a traves de un operativo de busqueda y vigilancia, hasta que lograron detenerlo sobre la calle Decima esquina con Manuel Muro de la colonia San Luis en la Capital potosina, donde le informaron de la orden de aprehension girada en su contra, asi como de los derechos que le asisten en su fase como asegurado. El detenido fue ingresado a las celdas del centro penitenciario de La Pila, a la espera de la autoridad judicial que llevara su caso para comenzar con su audiencia inicial.

America Recycles Week reminds us of the importance of working together to protect our environment – especially as we face new challenges because of COVID-19.
 The pandemic has dramatically changed our day-to-day lives, with many Texans working and schooling from home. This increased amount of time in the household has led to more products consumed at home, and in turn, a greater demand for recycling collections leaving many systems struggling to keep up with the unprecedented demand.
 In light of these challenges, America's leading beverage companies – Coca- Cola, Keurig Dr Pepper and PepsiCo – haven't slowed their commitment to reducing the industry's footprint by getting every bottle back so that it’s remade into new bottles. In fact, this year as part of the beverage industry’s _Every Bottle Back_ initiative, $3 million was invested in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex to modernize the collection, recycling and processing of recyclable material in the region.

Need a lift? In this chaotic world, torn amidships by COVID-19 on the one hand, politics on the other and financial stress to boot, it could be said we probably all need a lift.
 I got lucky this morning and found one. I just happened to stumble across a travelogue written by Christoph Niemann, first published online by The New York Times on March 25 and again on Nov. 13 in order to perfect the original. The title of the travelogue is, “In Praise of a Normal, Boring Country.”
 The country in question is Estonia which earned its independence from the Soviet Union through acts of incredible courage and imagination during the breakup of that empire 30 or so years ago. Among those incredible acts of courage and determination was a decision by the people of Estonia to gather in a giant, outdoor stadium to sing their national anthem and other patriotic songs while Russian tanks were lined up at the border.
 The tanks eventually turned back. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania earned their independence and the Cold War that had haunted the planet for 50 years was shelved for a time. The world became a better place, and we all learned what acts of courage and determination can do if we can only summon them at the right time. Now may be that time.

 Concretely, Chris, what do you actually recommend. Be specific, clear eyed and medically and scientifically sound. Obviously, the economy is suffering, but are you suggesting a business as usual approach, let the number of cases (and serious illnesses and deaths) to increase in a move toward "herd immunity." Can you provide a reason why the US has the most cases and deaths, by a long shot, than any other country in the world. Could that have anything to do with Trump's mismanagement of the pandemic and his insistence of turning mask wearing into a culture war?

The pair first met as freewheeling Miami Beach middle schoolers, frequenting teen nightclubs and eventually strip clubs before they even finished high school. But together they shared big dreams of following in the footsteps of Lil Kim — “She never goes out of style,” says Yung Miami — as well as South Florida bad-girl MCs like Trina and Jacki-O. “When I rap, I flow like Jacki-O,” says JT. “Trina’s sexiness, her straightforwardness, is so Miami. She’s like me and Caresha.”
 Much like their foremothers, City Girls aim playfully withering barbs at broke suitors and fake friends over Miami Bass-influenced 808 beats. They were discovered after Kevin “Coach K” Lee and Pierre “P.” Thomas, CEOs of Quality Control Music, heard about them while out to lunch in Miami; a model-waitress, Ari Lopez, recounted the girls’ live rap set at a local strip club.
 “We signed the City Girls knowing that JT was going to prison,” Thomas tells The Times. “That’s how much we believed in them. She was already sentenced. We got lawyers to help get [the] judge to agree to extend time to turn herself in. … The judge actually granted her enough time to put a record together.”
 The City Girls released their debut mixtape, “Period,” on Quality Control and rapidly generated buzz beyond Miami’s hip-hop underground. Their career really took off in June 2018, when they appeared uncredited on Drake’s 305-flavored bounce track, “In My Feelings,” which eventually hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Just days before JT began her prison sentence, they wrote and recorded their full-length debut, “Girl Code _,”_ which was released later that year.

Bloomberg) -- Talkspace, an online therapy app promoted by celebrities including swimmer Michael Phelps and singer Demi Lovato, is working with an adviser on a potential sale, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
 The New York-based company could be valued at about $1 billion in a sale, said one of the people, who asked to not be identified because the talks are private.
 The business has attracted interest from special purpose acquisition companies, one person said. Health-care and technology firms have also shown interest, the people said. Discussions may not lead to a deal and Talkspace could choose to remain independent, they said.
 “Interest in acquiring the company is not new -- and as demand for telehealth services has grown dramatically over the months of the Covid-19 pandemic, that interest has grown with it,” Talkspace Chief Executive Officer Oren Frank said in a statement.
 Talkspace links patients with licensed therapists by video chat and text, allowing them to seek treatment from home. The company uses tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze transcripts of therapy sessions to detect trends in a patient’s behavior that it says can lead to better treatment options.
 The startup raised $50 million from investors last year and struck a a deal with U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc.
 The talks come as a huge increase in telemedicine services amid a global health crisis has made those types of businesses particularly attractive.
 Teladoc Health Inc. said it was acquiring Livongo Health Inc. in August, and telemedicine company Hims Inc. plans to go public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company.

Gov. Scott’s Executive Order of Friday, Nov. 13, suffers from some major blind spots. I certainly understand the need to respond to our current spike in COVID-19 cases, but given there is no enforcement mechanism entailed in the order, Scott is asking for voluntary buy-in, and the greatest barrier to voluntary buy-in is logical inconsistency and a perception that a new rule is arbitrary, unevenly applied and unreasonably restrictive in certain contexts while leaving others unaffected.
 The Executive Order bans any and all multi-household gatherings, even if they take place outdoors. As reported by The New York Times, “Researchers found that the chance of coronavirus transmission occurring indoors was nearly 20 times higher when compared with outdoors.” Meanwhile, gatherings continue to be permitted in enclosed spaces — within restaurants, gyms, houses of worship and other “structured” environments. Besides ignoring the fact outdoor activities are so much safer in terms of virus transmission, this order belittles the capacity of Vermonters to responsibly structure their own get- togethers and presumes restaurant owners/managers, for instance, to be more capable of following CDC guidelines than, say, old friends who value their daily healthy walk together out in nature and maintain at least 6 feet of separation.
 Are gyms, churches and restaurants really safer than a walk in the woods?
 On the emotional front, too, today’s order threatens to alienate even otherwise willingly compliant citizens, we who have previously understood and embraced the necessity of inconvenient anti-pandemic measures. As a leftist, I’m not usually alert to the heavy hand of the nanny state; however, when a government asks for my participation in an extreme warping of ordinary social life, the underlying rationale had better make extremely good sense. Citizen- state trust is a two-way street.

To delve into mixtape Fabolous is to get lost down a nearly inescapable rabbit hole. The _There Is No Competition_ series, the _Summer Shootout_ series, and of course, the _S.O.U.L. Tape_ series make for an endless stream of music that, frankly, has fluctuated in quality over the years.
 But the mixtape arena was also where Fab truly thrived when given the space to let loose. He was never a commercial rapper. Early on, he was initially touted as a lyrical New York boxer by the legendary DJ Clue, who relied on Fab's quick wit and effortless machismo to establish Desert Storm Records as a force to be reckoned with.
 Like I said, to really dive into Fab's mixtapes is to enter a wormhole and never return, but there was always something different about _S.O.U.L. Tape 2_. Lil Mo's presence was undoubtedly missed, but there were glistening moments of transparency sprinkled across the tape, because Fab was given the space to just rap. "For the Love" feels like a well deserved exhale, with Fabolous basking in the sun, describing his bars as a "Kit Kat of some well deserved real sh*t."

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (WAND) - Arts, culture, food, education - these are just a few things Champaign County has to offer. According to Visit Champaign County, Champaign-Urbana is a rapidly growing area.
 “We are in the heart of the Midwest, literally at the crossroads of three major interstates (that) are very accessible. It's a fantastic community to visit because we're affordable. We're easy to get to, and we have a tremendous amount of amenities to explore,” said Terri Reifsteck, the vice president of marketing and community engagement at Visit Champaign.
 Champaign is home to a variety of public art, allowing the community to see over 150 pieces of art in just an afternoon walk.
 “Champaign is filled with a lot of art and culture, which is one of the things we really pride ourselves on!” Reifsteck said.
 The Krannert Art Museum is free to the public and showcases global artwork for the entire east central Illinois community.
 Champaign is a college town, surrounded by students experiencing freedom for the first time. Campustown offers a variety of bars, shops and dining for both students and the rest of the Champaign community. Reifsteck said there is more to Champaign than the U of I.
 “While the University of Illinois is our foundation, we’re really built around agriculture. Local agriculture has afforded our restaurants the opportunity to incorporate ingredients and that allows people in the fall to go out and pick pumpkins and apples and allows people to go to area farms," Reifsteck said.
 Because of the restrictions in place for COVID-19, Reifsteck said exploring Champaign County has not been the same. Visit Champaign County put together virtual tours of all the different amenities the city has to offer.
 “It’s a really unique and special opportunity that you can’t find in many places," Reifsteck said.
 The virtual tours on the Visit Champaign County website show amenities such as dining, museums, arts and farming. All of the tours emphasize why Champaign County is a place to not only visit, but to call home.
 “We have been ranked nationally as (one of the) best places to live," said Champaign Mayor Deborah Feinen. "We are a great place to raise a family, and we're also a great place to, you know, explore freedom for the first time if you're coming here as a student.”
 So whether someone comes to Champaign as a student, young professional, or family, Feinen said there are amenities to enjoy for every chapter of life.

She said the man put his hand over her mouth and told her not to scream or he would shoot her and her roommate.
 The man then blindfolded her and sexually assaulted her. He also disabled her telephone, searched the home for valuables, and drank a beer from the refrigerator, according to the woman.
 • On June 26, a 30-year-old woman in Middletown gave police a similar report. In her case, the man broke in through the sliding doors and jumped on her while she slept. He put a gun to her head and said he had just shot someone earlier for not cooperating.
 Before sexually assaulting her, the man guided the blindfolded woman downstairs to get her purse. After the attack, the man remained in her home for several hours, and at one point asked about food in the refrigerator.
 • On July 21, a 24-year-old woman in Windsor reported that a masked man had broken into her apartment and sexually assaulted her. She woke up to him holding a gun against her head, the woman reported.
 The woman said she was blindfolded, sexually assaulted, and then forced to sit in a chair while the man searched her home for valuables and money.
 The man also disabled her phone, changed the time on her clocks, and ran water from the faucets to hide when he actually left the home, the woman told police.
 • On July 24, a 24-year-old woman from Rocky Hill reported that a man who broke into her apartment with a gun had sexually assaulted her.
 The woman said she was sleeping in bed with her 2-year-old daughter when she woke up to the man holding a gun to her head. The man started to touch her, and she asked if she could move her daughter to another room.
 He first blindfolded her, before leading her to another bedroom, where she left her daughter, the woman said. The man then led her back to her bedroom, where he sexually assaulted her.
 All of the woman said they didn’t know their attacker.
 In each case police obtained DNA samples, but for decades were unable to match the DNA found at the crime scenes with samples in DNA databases.
 Still, detectives believed that the sexual assaults were all committed by the same person based on similarities in the commission of the crimes, the proximity of the victims’ home to major highways, and descriptions of the suspect’s speech and demeanor.
 Recently, investigators began using publicly available genealogy information to try and solve the cases, and developed Sharpe as a suspect.
 On Nov. 9, investigators retrieved DNA from items found in the trash outside Sharpe’s home in Malrborough, and it matched the DNA found in 1984 at the crime scenes.
 To confirm the match, investigators applied for and were granted permission to obtain a sample of DNA from Sharpe directly, which also matched.
 The investigation was aided by a recent $470,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice made available to fund the use of advanced DNA technology to prosecute crime cold cases.

In another narrative piece done over harrowing piano keys, Fab once again is cruising comfortably in his lane on "Change You or Change Me." While Fab's sophomore effort was tepid across the board (he leaned a little too heavily on the R&B/rap formula), "Change You or Change Me" was one of the few offerings that stood out, merely because it found the NY rapper doing what he does best: dropping genuine rhymes and slick wordplay, reaffirming that he's still the same valiant battle rapper.
 "This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you," he raps on the song's hook. _Street Dreams_ was bloated, and undoubtedly curated for mainstream audiences, a trend that he's continued to lean on with moderate success over the years, but Fab's best moments are always when he breaks the mold and speaks to the people, making "Change You Or Change Me" a street anthem in its own right.

CIAC executive director Glenn Lungarini said Tuesday that almost half of state schools surveyed said that they would suspend all athletic activities if they switched to distance learning, making it apparent the logistics of trying to schedule competition in that environment would be difficult.
 “The conversation with the board was really centered around the number of schools that we’re seeing go to distance learning,” Lungarini said. “We’re starting to see more schools lean toward a Jan. 19 date as a return … The board felt this was a decision that gave clear direction and also kept the safety of our school communities at the forefront.”
 One hundred of the state’s 169 towns are classified as red. Locally, Tolland, Manchester, East Hartford, East Windsor, Windsor Locks and Windsor are in the red category.
 “(The decision) is primarily based off of information from member schools and the discussion with principals, which are the voting members on the board today,” Lungarini said. “We did provide a great experience for about 30,000 kids in the fall. We have that same goal and anticipation as we come in on Jan. 19. We think it’s a reasonable date where we can understand where we are in terms of getting through the holidays, and how our schools are impacted over the next couple of months.”
 Lungarini’s email stated that the board of control would continue to collaborate with the state Department of Public Health, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office and the CSMS Sports Medicine Committee in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 19 start.
 “It's disappointing news, but with the news that a half dozen or so districts are shifting to 100 percent remote learning, it's not surprising,” South Windsor High boys basketball coach Jim Dargati said. “I think that's just the tip of the iceberg. So the CIAC looked at the safety concerns and scheduling headaches and made the decision. For the kids, it's disheartening, but I'm trying to get them to realize that everyone is trying to pull this off. You have to keep the faith and do your part. Stay the course. Prepare like there's going to be a season. ”

 # Jude Law plays a man adrift in ambition in 'The Nest'
 Ed Symkus
 More Content Now
 The setting is a ranch house on a nice spread of land in woodsy, suburban New York. The time is ... well, we don’t know the exact year, but President Reagan is talking on the radio. Mom and dad and their two kids appear to be happy together. Allison (Carrie Coon) has some rental properties and gives horse riding lessons. Daughter Samantha (Oona Roche) – from Allison’s first marriage – is a budding gymnast. Son Ben (Charlie Shotwell) is happy to play soccer out back with dad. Dad is Rory (Jude Law), who drives the kids to school each day, then gets lost in thought about how well he was doing in London – before they relocated to the States – and how his career (he’s some sort of entrepreneur) is now floundering.
 It’s in that ranch house that Rory makes a secret phone call, to his old boss in London, and when all is said and done, announces to Allison that they’re moving to London because “I have an opportunity there, and I’m running out of options here.”
 He goes on to tell her the first of many lies about the details of that opportunity, but it’s soon clear that lying is part of what he does. Rory knows his way around his business, and he’s a great talker and charmer, but his life and career are all about putting up a good front, convincing people that he’s more ... better ... richer than he really is.
 Despite opposition from Allison and the kids, the family changes settings, and is soon living in a huge manse out in the English countryside (Rory brags to Ben that Led Zeppelin once recorded an album there; is it another lie?). He’s back in an office, working as a commodities broker for his old boss Arthur (Michael Culkin, whose IMDB bio mentions that he’s “unmarried and lives in London and Norfolk with several dogs and a llama”), and has plans to move up the ladder within the firm.
 But Rory keeps getting in his own way. He wants to show off Allison at a big party. She’s not comfortable with that. He tells everyone he meets that he sends his kids to expensive schools. No one cares. He explains to Allison that Arthur approached him about the job, but she finds out that’s not at all the way it happened.
 The film is both a study of an ambitious man who’s out of control, and of a family that’s coming apart because of him. Mom and dad and the two kids are definitely not happy together. He isn’t up to the task at work, she’s forced to take on a menial job, Ben is bullied at school, Samantha is becoming surly. They’re being stretched to their limits, and we worry about all four of them.
 Writer-director Sean Durkin, whose only previous feature was the intense and unsettling “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” has sharpened his skills here, both in his script’s words and the way he has his actors deliver them. Most noteworthy are the two-hander scenes between Law and Coon, and the ones with Law and Culkin. There’s also a great, forlorn soliloquy from Law in the back seat of a cab about once being rich.
 One of the most impressive feats that Durkin pulls off is keeping the film on an even keel, making it appear that nothing much is happening, though all the while hints are being dropped as to where everything is heading.
 Personal funds dwindle, confrontations about it occur, more lies are told, tensions rise, deals fall apart, desperation sets in. Things turn verbally and emotionally angry. The story has an uncertain ending, but Durkin doesn’t leave viewers in a despondent mood. He manages to blend in the tiniest glimmer of hope that things just might work out.
 “The Nest” is now available on all cable and digital VOD platforms.

"It's not easy operating in a low-rate environment where profit margins are feeling the squeeze, but there aren't many winners on the back of this month's rate cut," Ms Tindall said. "Savings rates are under fire, most mortgage customers are unlikely to get relief and credit card rates haven't moved a muscle."

Matt Morgan, the Trump campaign's general counsel, said last week the campaign was trying to halt certification in battleground states until it could get a better handle on vote tallies and whether it would have the right to automatic recounts. Right now, Trump is requesting a recount in Wisconsin in two counties, and Georgia is doing an hand audit after Biden led by a slim margin of 0.3 percentage points, but there is no mandatory recount law in the state. The law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points.

Is it incredible that we're getting more of Dempsey down the road? Absolutely, and it's almost still hard to believe that it's happening. The actor left the show in a sudden, shocking way, and all signs pointed to it being a complicated departure. Yet, his return seems to be brought about thanks to Ellen Pompeo having a conversation with him, and the two collaborating with Vernoff and a small group of directors (in particular Debbie Allen and series regular Kevin McKidd) to make sure that the return stayed under wraps. In a way, that was the most remarkable part of the return -- somehow, people did not figure out that it was happening until the episode aired.

DAVIE, Fla.
 Former Miami Dolphins Pro Bowl safety Reshad Jones was arrested early Wednesday on a charge of carrying a concealed firearm.
 According to a police report, Jones was walking in a gas station parking lot at 4:15 a.m. with a loaded handgun protruding from his pants pocket, and said he had never had a concealed weapons permit. Jones was difficult with officers and appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance, the report said.
 Jones, 32, played for the Dolphins from 2010-19 and twice made the Pro Bowl. He was released March 18 and has been out of the NFL since.

Explica Tomas: «El escrito inedito que aqui se presenta es un fragmento del texto manuscrito de 81 paginas que Rafael Sanchez Ferlosio preparo entre los dias 13 y 18 de junio de 1997 con vistas a la entrevista de caracter autobiografico que le hizo Felix de Azua a finales de ese mismo mes para el numero 31 que la revista Archipielago dedico al escritor con ocasion de su setenta cumpleaños. Varias secciones del manuscrito preparatorio fueron despues incorporadas al escrito La forja de un plumifero, publicado inicialmente en el mismo numero de la citada revista, pero otras muchas del mayor interes, como la que aqui ofrecemos, han permanecido ineditas hasta el presente. Sanchez Ferlosio prefirio que la revista Archipielago publicase La forja de un plumifero en lugar de la entrevista de Felix de Azua, que salio a la luz en el año 2019 en el libro de entrevistas Dialogos con Sanchez Ferlosio».

The city may be open to working with the team on a plan to allow fans at 25 percent capacity, Aragón's letter said, after the city reaches the state's yellow tier of reopening -- which would require an unadjusted case rate of less than 1.0 daily new cases per 100,000 and a test positivity rate less than 2 percent. The city is currently in the red tier, two steps away from yellow, while much of the rest of the state moved into the purple tier this week -- the state's most restrictive.
