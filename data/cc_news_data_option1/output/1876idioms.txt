Katelyn Ladner envisioned playing soccer at a big college and was happy when one began to court her.


   


  But the bigger school wanted a quick decision and South Effingham's standout defender didn't want to make a hurried choice with her future dangling in the balance.


   


  So one door closed, but another remained open with a welcome mat firmly in place -- Brewton-Parker College.


   


  Ladner said because of the pandemic, classrooms on the Mount Vernon campus were closed, but she toured the surroundings with her family. They had a picnic at nearby scenic Jones Lake.


   


  And her suddenly less-skeptical mind began asking, why not Brewton-Parker?


   


  "They were the first people who showed interest. (The B-P coaching staff) reached out. They had been steady. It was just meant to be," said Ladner who recently signed a letter of intent with the Barons.


   


  Ladner will be joining a program headed in the right direction. The Barons, who play in NAIA's Southern States Athletic Conference, won seven games last season, their most since the 2005 season. In March, B-P received a commitment from Sarah De Gannes, an attacking midfielder who played on Trinidad and Tobago's under-20 national team.


   


  The school's home-like feel is genuine. The Barons have a roster with local flavor. Former Effingham County players Mackenzie Stewart and Jamesasa Carter and Liberty County's Sydney Wilkinson were linked to the 2019 team.


   


  South Effingham coach Amanda Johnson said Ladner's versatility should be another asset for Brewton-Parker. Ladner played forward as a high school freshman before moving to right back on defense her last three years.


   


  In travel ball at Effingham United and later Savannah United, Ladner played forward.


   


  "The great thing is college coaches can shape Katelyn to fill their needs," Johnson said. "She has that all-around ability and that's valuable. She's shapeable."


   


  Ladner's senior year at South Effingham also shaped a career path. She participated in a work-based learning program at Effingham County Hospital. During a nine-week rotation, she worked in physical therapy, medical sourcing, the emergency room and medical laboratory.


   


  It pointed her toward working for a degree in health and wellness.


   


  Ladner's future appears exciting, but a little bit of the past was taken away by the coronavirus. She was a key performer on the Mustangs' 2019 soccer team that went undefeated in Region 2-5A play and advanced to the second round of the Class 5A state tournament.


   


  As a junior, Ladner had SEHS' game-winning goal in the second half to beat Effingham County 2-1 and snap a five-game losing streak to the cross county rival.


   


  This season, 10 players off the 2019 team returned as seniors, including college-bound Ella Higdon (Reinhardt University) and Amber Whitten (Wesleyan College).


   


  "It was disappointing we didn't get a chance to go even farther as a team," Ladner said. "We started slowly, but I think we had the talent. If all of us were on the same page, we could really be something."

WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court justices on Wednesday grilled lawyers advocating that "electors" in the complex Electoral College system that decides the winner of U.S. presidential elections are free to disregard laws directing them to back the candidate who prevails in their state's popular vote.


  If enough electors do so, it could upend an election, or, as some of the justices said, cause "chaos."


  The justices heard arguments in two closely watched cases - one from Colorado and one from Washington state - less than six months before the Nov. 3 election in which presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden challenges Republican President Donald Trump.


  The justices also expressed concern over maintaining states' ability to remove electors who have been bribed to vote for a particular candidate. On the other hand, the justices also pressed attorneys for Colorado and Washington state whether there are any limits on state powers seeking to control how electors vote.


  The litigation involves the presidential election system set out in the U.S. Constitution in which the winner is determined not by amassing a majority in the national popular vote but by securing a majority of electoral votes allotted to the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.


  The cases involve so-called faithless electors who did not vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Electoral College even though she won the popular vote in their states.


  Colorado and Washington state are among the 48 states - only Maine and Nebraska excepted - with winner-takes-all systems awarding all electors to the candidate who wins the state's popular vote. The justices must decide if states can penalize faithless electors with actions such as monetary fines or removal from the role.


  Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia have laws intended to control how electors vote. Only a handful enforce them with penalties.


  Conservative Justice Samuel Alito wondered whether giving electors free reign "would lead to chaos" in instances in which an election is very close and "the rational response of the losing political party ... would be to launch a massive campaign to try to influence electors."


  Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked whether the court should embrace the "avoid-chaos principle of judging, which suggests that if it's a close call or a tie-breaker we shouldn't facilitate or create chaos."


  Lawyer Lawrence Lessig, representing the Washington state electors, conceded that was a possibility.


  Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas told a lawyer representing Colorado's electors that a despite a promise to support the popular-vote winner an elector "can suddenly say, 'I'm going to vote for Frodo Baggins,'" referring to the character from the fantasy novel Lord of the Rings.


  The Electoral College vote, held weeks after the general election, is often overlooked as a mere formality in which the electors - typically party loyalists - actually vote for the winner of their state's popular vote.


  But in 2016, 10 of the 538 electors voted for someone else. While that number of so-called faithless electors did not change the election's outcome, it would have in five of the 58 previous U.S. presidential elections.


  State officials have said faithless electors threaten the integrity of American democracy by subverting the will of the electorate and opening the door to corruption. The plaintiffs said the Constitution requires them to exercise independent judgment to prevent unfit candidates from taking office.


  "It's somewhat hard to understand the concept of something I am pledged - bound - to do. I have made a promise to do something. But that promise is unenforceable," liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said.


  Trump's administration has taken no stance in the cases.


  Chiafalo and another lead plaintiff Micheal Baca were Democratic electors who sought to persuade Republican electors to disregard their pledges and help deny Trump the presidency. Baca, who now lives in Las Vegas, was a Colorado elector. They cast their ballots for moderate Republicans and not Clinton.


  Chiafalo was fined $1,000 by Washington state. Baca's vote was canceled by Colorado officials. The electors argued that the penalties against them by their states violated the Constitution's Article II and its 12th Amendment, which delineate the Electoral College process.


  A lower court upheld Washington state's fine against Chiafalo and two other faithless electors. Another court concluded that Colorado's action against Baca violated his constitutional rights.

Monica James' first girls' basketball head coaching job at Long Cane Middle School in LaGrange netted exactly one win during her first season.


   


  By the time she left, Long Cane had five straight middle school titles.


   


  So James, a Pembroke native, has an idea of the task ahead at Effingham County High School. She'll take over for interim coach Wade Wright and inherit a squad that won one game during the 2019-20 season.


   


  "My first two years were hard" at Long Cane, James said. "They didn't win many games and it was stressful. I definitely understand the challenge Effingham County has."


   


  James comes to Springfield after working the last three years as an assistant at Troup County High School under head coach Carla Thornton. During those three seasons, the Tigers improved from 13-10 to 17-9 to 27-2, advancing last season to the Class 4A state championship game.


   


  "I learned a lot from" Thornton, James said. "I learned, don't just be one of those 'yes' coaches. She put her trust in me and allowed me to run the defense. It made me work hard and prepared me to be a head coach."


   


  James also drew from a wealth of experience. She played basketball for four years at Bryan County High School under veteran coach Johnnie Miller.


   


  Miller built a powerhouse in Pembroke and won 613 games and 12 region titles in his 34 years.


   


  James was one of the many Redskins under Miller who earned a chance to play basketball and further their education in college. She started at North Florida Community College before finishing a bachelor's degree in special education at Georgia Southwestern State University. She then got a master's degree at Columbus State University.


   


  Down the road, she hopes to be a school administrator.


   


  But first things first for James. Turning around the girls' basketball program at ECHS won't be easy in a region filled with strong programs. Glynn Academy was the state runner-up in Class 6A. Statesboro, a new addition to the region, won 22 games last season and Brunswick and Bradwell Institute won 19 and 18 games respectively.


   


  "My thing is to start building trust and get the girls respect," James said. "I wish I could have gotten here sooner. I'm worried the summer might be lost (because of restrictions caused by the coronavirus) and we need the work. For me being a first-year coach, that's big."


   


  But possibly knowing first-hand how a program can flip from down to up is bigger. James grew just like her middle schoolers and when they both arrived at the Troup County varsity, the journey proved rewarding.


   


  "I was fortunate to coach (those girls) and follow them up," she said. Seeing players improve "is what it's all about."

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch’s crackdown on smuggling of prohibited products could blow the lid off a larger racket involving misuse of government-issued passes for heavy vehicles. In the third such incident this month, the Crime Branch has seized gutkha and tobacco products, this time from a vehicle with permission to transport groceries and water.
 The racket was busted after police inspector Sunil Mane, in charge of Unit X, received a tip-off and conducted a raid near Malik Compound in Chandivali on Tuesday. The police team searched a truck parked outside the compound and found 12 sacks of gutkha and scented supari containing tobacco. Transport of both are currently prohibited due to the nationwide lockdown.
 “The truck’s windshield had a sticker saying it had permission to transport groceries and water in the lockdown. The total value of the seized goods is ₹11.8 lakh,” said a Crime Branch officer.
 The Unit X arrested Akash Gupta (28), a resident of Mohili village in Saki Naka who was minding the truck, and charged him under the Food Safety Act and the Disaster Management Act. He has been remanded in police custody till May 16. The police have identified as least two others who were part of the racket. Efforts are on to trace and apprehend them, officers said.
 This is the third such raid, and the second by Unit X. On May 8, the Unit X had seized contraband worth ₹ 28 lakh from Shivaji Nagar, while on Monday, Unit XI had seized gutkha and pan masala worth ₹39.65 lakh. In both cases, heavy vehicles with stickers of permission to transport essential commodities were used to smuggle the prohibited goods.
 “After every seizure, we send a detailed report to the government. We are looking into the larger aspects of the racket, like the supply chain and the network involved,” Mr. Mane said.

The return of Jameis Winston to his old stomping grounds will be an intriguing storyline heading into this one. But, barring injury, the biggest story of this matchup will be Brees versus Tom Brady. Dating back to his Chargers days, Brees and Brady have dueled five times, with Brees taking three of those contests. In 2020, this clash of the titans will take place not once but twice in the regular season. And that's not even considering the fact that we could be in store for a Saints-Bucs playoff matchup down the road, which has never occurred. For all he's done in his 21 years under center, Brady has often been tagged as the one, true GOAT but some believe Brees -- the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards, completions and TD passes -- has a case to make in that conversation. Head-to-heads like these always have tendency to throw another log on that fire. Winning road games in the NFC South are rarely an easy feat; considering the personnel on the Bucs sideline and the gravity of this contest, this could be another week, another monstrous opponent for Brees and the Saints.

You have to go all the way back to 1985 and Rocky Balboa versus Ivan Drago to find a Christmas Day sporting event with a revenge hook as juicy as this. The 13-3 Saints entered the playoffs in January as arguably the best No. 3 seed in NFL history. The inconsistent Vikings were exactly the kind of team you'd expect to get turned into cannon fodder by a superior January opponent. But the Vikings didn't blink in the Wild Card Round, and Kirk Cousins connected with Kyle Rudolph on a third-and-goal pass in overtime to secure a stunning 26-20 win. "I'm just glad Kirk can't win big games, apparently," Rudolph told FOX immediately after the game. "We proved that one wrong today." It was a bitter pill for the Saints, who have now had their hearts broken by the Vikings in _two_ of the last three postseasons.

Now moving to slide 8; if you take away one thing from today's call, it's that culture matters. The Rexnord Business System, which is simply the way we work in our common language is without a doubt the single biggest competitive advantage we have. It's about everyone being on the same page and always doing the right thing for our associates, for our customers for our shareholders. It's about being nimble and entrepreneurial, and this is inside a framework of disciplined tools and processes that allow everyone to be fact based and decisive. Our philosophy engaging our people around a plan with processes to drive performance, is something that's ingrained in our culture. And while it's always fun to do it in a growth environment, harnessing the power of our culture during times like this to beat our competition and take market shares equally is rewarded. Our team is 6,700 people strong, the average age is 44 and the average tenure is 10 years. We're diverse, about 40% of our U.S. workforce is diverse. Some of the amazing things that our team has done and led, include things like cleaning food drives for local food pantries, making masks for one another, donating PP&E to hospitals and healthcare workers, leveraging our 3D capabilities to make respirator masks, and I think as you may have seen, we've donated $1 million of hygienic product to healthcare facilities and the list goes on and on.

SUSSEX BOROUGH -- The mayor and council will deliberate tonight on whether to contract with a paid ambulance service that could effectively spell an end to the volunteer first aid squad that has served borough residents for more than 80 years.


   


  Representatives of Atlantic Health and Saint Clare's ambulance services will be on hand at the start of tonight's Borough Council meeting, which will be held virtually and begin at 7 o'clock, to discuss what they have to offer and to answer questions.


   


  No decision has been made, but the cost of maintaining the borough-owned ambulances coupled with the recent inability of the borough's volunteer ambulance service -- which operates under the auspices of the Sussex Fire Department -- to hold fundraising events due to the COVID-19 shutdown has exacerbated what Mayor Ed Meyer says are structural issues that borough officials have no choice but to address.


   


  A mishap a few weeks ago, in which an ambulance had its front end go out while returning from a call late on a Saturday night, appears to have been the final impetus for considering a private service.


   


  "I'm trying to keep the emotions out of it because it isn't anything about the volunteers, who are all doing a wonderful job and are in many ways the social fabric of our community," Meyer said.


   


  "But that (the front end mishap) is a problem that puts the patients as well as our first responders in danger, and it's the responsibility of the council and mayor to look out for the health, safety and well-being of the volunteers as well as our residents -- and it's also my job as mayor to gather the information that several members of our council have asked for and provide it to them, and that's what I've tried to do."


   


  But according to Marc Leech, chief of the Sussex Fire Department, many of the emergency medical technicians who volunteer with the department's first aid squad feel "blindsided" and are upset about not having been consulted before the issue became public.


   


  "We should have been given the respect of at least being approached about it first," Leech said.


   


  Although the Sussex Fire Department's ambulance service does much of its own fundraising to pay for minor vehicle repairs, Leech acknowledged that the front end repair is a major expense -- one he suggested borough officials may not want to pay for. Still, whatever the cost, Leech said borough residents would be poorly served by any decision to pull the plug on the borough's volunteer ambulance squad.


   


  "Right now you're being served by your neighbors and friends," Leech said. "With a paid service, you're not going to get that personalized service, and you're also going to get billed for it."


   


  The Sussex Fire Department has been in existence for over 120 years and its ambulance service has been around for about 83 of those years, according to Leech. Currently, he said, the department has a membership of about 55 volunteers, including about 16 certified EMTs of whom about 12 are also cross- trained as firefighters.


   


  The department provides firefighting service to all of Sussex Borough as well a portion of neighboring Wantage. The first aid squad mainly serves Sussex Borough but also provides backup to Wantage and neighboring communities through mutual aid.


   


  About half the department's EMTs are residents of Sussex Borough, according to Leech. The balance of EMTs, and a majority of its firefighters, live in Wantage.

BUTTE-As Montana continues on its road to reopening, the World Museum of Mining in Butte is gearing up to open as soon as they get the green light from the health department.


  The World Museum of Mining originally planned to open on April 1, for the season. However, museum director Jeanette Kopf says they've used the extra time to work on projects like replacing board walks, fixing signs and deep cleaning the museum.


  The museum will open in small phases, starting with the gift shop and they hope to begin tours Memorial Day weekend, says Kopf.


  She adds they've added additional hand sanitizing stations and put up sneeze guards to protect their employees.


  In addition, masks will be required on tours and groups will be limited to six people. Kopf says they're excited to open their doors as soon as it's safe to do so.


  "I want to make sure we are as safe as we can be, so as soon as the health department clears my plan and comes out and talks to us we will do what they say and get open as soon as they're comfortable and we're comfortable," said Kopf.


  She adds they're working closely with the health department and are waiting to get cleared to open. Once the museum gets the green light, their hours will be limited and Kopf says they will only be open four or five days a week to start.
