Also to reach the psyche of the character it was very important to browse through my own experiences. Insecurities come with love and hence the balance between being possessive and insecure is the thin thread we walk on to make any relationship work. We live in a very complex world and too many interlinked dynamics at play. Manoeuvring your relationship through this chaos and surviving the ride can be very challenging.

Burgess’s evaluation screams Patriots for several reasons. First, Burgess got tons of love from his coaches and teammates for his preparation and attention to film study during the week. Second, he’s a converted cornerback that’s now a versatile safety playing high zone, slot corner, and in the box at a consistent level. And third, he’s a core special teamer that played on all four kick coverage units. Burgess has some of the best ball-hawking plays in this safety class, mostly from split-safety structures. He’ll stay over the top of multiple vertical routes and read the quarterback’s eyes to jump downfield throws for interceptions with plenty of range over the top (4.46 speed). He also has man coverage skills to guard slot receivers and tight ends. Burgess’s lack of size and length hurts him; his smaller stature could be an issue in the box, and his lack of arm length makes it tougher to contest at the catch point. But he projects as a future starter in either a Chung-like role or possibly at free safety a la Duron Harmon.

Louis van Gaal refused to use the attack on Manchester United's bus as an excuse for his side's 3-2 defeat to West Ham on Tuesday.
 Kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes after United's arrival at the stadium was halted by West Ham fans attacking the team bus.
 United were given the time back in full to prepare for the game but started sluggishly as Diafra Sakho opened the scoring just 10 minutes into proceedings.
 Andy Carroll and Dimitri Payet both had good chances to add to the lead as United struggled to come to terms with the pace of the game but eventually hit the lead through an Anthony Martial double, only for goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid to seal the win for West Ham in what was Upton Park's last game.
 But while Van Gaal said some of United's players may have been affected by what happened prior to kick-off, he refused to use it as an excuse as the team's Champions League hopes were dealt a major blow.
 "We live in this world. We know that. I know that, it is not the first time it happens, but okay, I have a long experience in football, there are players that don't have the experience, so it shall have an influence," he said.
 "But I don't think we should look for excuses. We changed the match in the second-half, 20 minutes before time, we are ahead, so I don't think you have to look for that excuse."
 The Dutchman also declined to criticise those involved.
 "I don't think that I have to say that because I think the media has filmed it so you can see it by your own eyes, you can make your opinion by yourself because I think the images shall be very clear," Van Gaal added.
 The loss left fifth-placed United needing to beat AFC Bournemouth on Sunday, while hoping Manchester City lose against Swansea City if they are to qualify for next season's Champions League.

Dimitri Payet says it is "very likely" he will still stay at West Ham for next season.
 Playmaker Payet took the Premier League by storm in his first campaign in English football, with the former Marseille man's performances earning him a spot on the shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year prize.
 The 29-year-old was also rewarded with a recall to the France squad and has been linked with a big-money move away from the Hammers, despite the fact he signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal with the club in February.
 But Payet, who is currently away on international duty in the build-up to Euro 2016, poured cold water on such speculation when asked about his future at a media conference on Saturday.
 "Journalists have placed me everywhere!" he said.
 "But I currently have no contact [with other clubs] and I signed a very long contract with West Ham. It is very likely that I'll still be here next season."
 Payet also insisted that he can improve further after a sensational debut campaign in the Premier League.
 "It's true that the last two years have been the best [of my career], but I still hope to progress," he added.
 "You can always learn and I work hard to be able to raise my level."

Jawaharlal Nehru University's (JNU) two academic committees tasked with giving suggestions to ensure uninterrupted learning activities for the rest of winter semester amid the ongoing lockdown, which have been extended till May 3 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, has made several recommendations such as conducting online examinations and applying virtual learning methods and cancelling the summer vacation this year.
 In a report, shared with the deans of all the schools and centres in the varsity last week, Chintamani Mahapatra rector, (pro-vice-chancellor), JNU, cited all the recommendations submitted by the two panels, which were formed on April 9, to ensure completion of the courses and conducting of examinations despite the Covid-19 pandemic.
 The report said that JNU is likely to remain closed during the rest of the winter semester and all efforts have to be made to conduct online examinations. It, however, said that the students, who will not be able to appear for online examinations due to lack of internet connectivity, will be allowed to take them after the lockdown restrictions are lifted.
 "Students, who will be unable to appear for examinations due to lack of internet connectivity, will be allowed to submit their assignments with a grace period. Those, who don't have internet connectivity during the lockdown period, will be permitted to appear after the restrictions are lifted. The examination pattern for the winter semester will be online and a uniform one for all the students," the report said.
 The committees have recommended that the evaluation process should be completed as per the academic calendar in a bid to ensure that the next semester starts on time.
 The panels have suggested online classes to ensure uninterrupted learning amid the lockdown. "Classes should be conducted via Zoom or other online platforms mutually convenient to a teacher and students," the report said. It has also recommended all the schools and centres to make term papers, projects, seminar papers and book reviews available online for the students.
 The committees have also recommended that the dates of submission of thesis for M. Phil students and Ph.D. scholars be extended in light of the prevailing lockdown.
 Also, the report suggested that summer vacation for this year be cancelled and conduct oral interviews for students, who qualify for JNU entrance examinations for the next academic session, via video-conferencing facility.
 The JNU Teachers' Association (JNUTA) joined the issue with the panels' recommendations and described them as academically and practically not feasible. The teachers' body said that JNU authorities have to adhere to the due process of approval from all the statutory bodies before implementing any of these suggestions.
 "Even if the due process is followed, however, the report cannot be the basis for the deliberations in the different institutional bodies that are part of that process. It, in fact, doesn't offer an academically and practically viable option at all. Options, other than what it suggests, have to be considered. No matter what the compulsions, teachers cannot accept a purely formal completion of the semester that reduces it to a farce. Teachers also stand ready to make the extra effort needed to ensure proper completion of the academic requirements prescribed," the JNUTA said in a statement.
 No immediate comment was available from either Mahapatra or JNU registrar Pramod Kumar.

Already, many abortions are induced at home with a two-drug combination, under the guidance of a health professional. Advocacy groups say home abortions using one of the drugs - misoprostol - can be done without professional oversight.
 Misoprostol is available only by prescription in the U.S. but is available online from some countries where it sells over the counter.
 Attorney Jill E. Adams, executive director of If/When/How, supports that option and urges prosecutors not to target women who use this method.
 "More people will need abortions during this pandemic," she said. "Targeting people who end their pregnancies at home is wrong as a matter of law and dangerous as a matter of public health."
 Amid debate about whether abortion is an essential service, anti-abortion rights protesters have mobilized outside numerous clinics - in some cases triggering confrontations with police over whether they're violating social- distancing rules. In North Carolina, eight of about 50 protesters were arrested April 4 after refusing to disperse outside a clinic in Charlotte.
 Even as many businesses close temporarily, anti-abortion rights pregnancy centers remain open. Virginia-based Care Net, which oversees about 1,100 centers, evoked the pandemic in a fundraising appeal, noting that unplanned pregnancies may rise during isolation and "our centers need to find creative ways to serve these parents and empower them to choose life."

Researchers have reported the first empirical findings linking the loss of smell and taste in patients with Covid-19, a finding that may become a new clinical screening measure for the virus. According to the study, published in the journal International Forum of Allergy and Rhinology, people with influenza-like symptoms, and a dysfunction of smell and taste, are strongly associated with Covid-19 infection.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here "Based on our study, if you have smell and taste loss, you are more than 10 times more likely to have Covid-19 infection than other causes of infection," said Carol Yan, an otolaryngologist and study co-author from the University of California San Diego in the US. While the most common first sign of a Covid-19 infection remains fever, Yan said, fatigue and loss of smell and taste follow as other very common initial symptoms. "We know Covid-19 is an extremely contagious virus. This study supports the need to be aware of smell and taste loss as early signs of Covid-19," she added.The researchers surveyed 1,480 patients with flu-like symptoms and concerns regarding potential Covid-19 infection who underwent testing at UC San Diego Health from March 3 through March 29, 2020. Of the patients surveyed, 102 tested positive for the virus and 1,378 tested negative. According to the study, there is a high prevalence and unique presentation of certain sensory impairments in patients positive with Covid-19. Of those who reported loss of smell and taste, the scientists said, the loss was typically profound, not mild. But they added that the rate of recovery of smell and taste was high and occurred usually within two to four weeks of infection. "Our study not only showed that the high incidence of smell and taste is specific to Covid-19 infection, but we fortunately also found that for the majority of people sensory recovery was generally rapid," Yan said. "Among the Covid-19 patients with smell loss, more than 70 per cent had reported improvement of smell at the time of survey and of those who hadn't reported improvement, many had only been diagnosed recently," she added. The researchers also found that persons who reported experiencing a sore throat more often tested negative for Covid-19.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Based on the findings, UC San Diego Health has included loss of smell and taste as a screening requirement for visitors and staff, as well as a marker for testing patients who may be positive for the virus. Respondents in the study were most often persons with milder forms of Covid-19 infection who did not require hospitalization or intubation. According to the scientists, other known symptoms of Covid-19 include fever, fatigue, cough, and difficulty breathing.The findings, Yan said, underline the importance of identifying early or subtle symptoms of Covid-19 infection in people who may be at risk of transmitting the disease as they recover within the community. "It is our hope that with these findings other institutions will follow suit and not only list smell and taste loss as a symptom of Covid-19, but use it as a screening measure for the virus across the world," she added.

TOKYO (AP) — There is no “Plan B” for the Olympics if they need to be postponed again because of the coronavirus pandemic, Tokyo organizers said Tuesday.
 Masa Takaya, the spokesman for the Tokyo Olympics, said organizers are proceeding under the assumption the Olympics will open on July 23, 2021. The Paralympics follow on Aug. 24.
 Those dates were set last month by the International Olympic Committee and Japanese officials after the coronavirus pandemic made it clear the Tokyo Games could not be held as scheduled this year.
 “We are working toward the new goal,” Takaya said, speaking in English on a teleconference call with journalists. “We don’t have a B Plan.”
 The severity of the pandemic and the death toll has raised questions if it will even be feasible to hold the Olympics in just over 15 months.
 “All I can tell you today is that the new games' dates for both the Olympic and Paralympic Games have been just set up,” Takaya said. “In that respect, Tokyo 2020 and all concerned parties now are doing their very best effort to deliver the games next year."

Tokyo, April 14 (Jiji Press)--The Japanese government decided at a cabinet meeting Tuesday to postpone the "Rikkoshi-no-Rei" ceremonies for Crown Prince Akishino for the time being, amid a state of emergency declared a week ago over the COVID-19 epidemic.
 The ceremonies are designed for the younger brother of Emperor Naruhito, who ascended the throne last year, to proclaim that he became the Crown Prince.
 The ceremonies include the main proclamation ritual, "Rikkoshi-Senmei-no-Gi," and the "Choken-no-Gi" audience with the Emperor, both initially scheduled to take place in the Imperial Palace this Friday.
 The government had already decided to conduct the Rikkoshi-Senmei-no-Gi ritual on a reduced scale and skip the "Kyuchu-Kyoen-no-Gi" banquets.
 Among other related events, visits by Crown Prince Akishino and his wife, Crown Princess Kiko, to Ise Jingu, a Shinto shrine complex in Mie Prefecture, central Japan, and the mausoleum of Emperor Jinmu, the country's mythical first Emperor, in the western prefecture of Nara have been put off.

Playing on the opposite side of first-round pick Andrew Thomas, Wilson is a dancing bear that’s steadily rising up the board among draftniks. At 6-6, 350 pounds, he has Trent Brown-like size with excellent foot speed and change of direction for a player of his stature. Wilson’s pass sets are a mess from a technical standpoint with sloppy footwork, lousy posture (leans too far back), and a narrow base that leaves him susceptible to counter rushers. Wilson’s biggest fix is getting rid of a false step in his initial kick out of his stance, where he tends to step underneath himself rather than back with his outside foot, which shortens the edge for rushers trying to turn the corner. Wilson, more often than not, gets close enough to his spot to force rushers to go through him, which they won’t be able to do often due to his size. He’s patient, plays to his strengths, and mauls defenders in the running game. With a few tweaks, Wilson will be a capable starter for a predominantly man- blocking team like New England.

Coffee is one of the most popular beverages around the world. There is a significant increase in the acceptance and appreciation of coffee as a beverage worldwide. Coffee’s taste depends on its essential ingredient. Coffee is a beverage which is made from roasted beans of the coffee plants. Coffee beans vary in their shape, size, color, and flavor which depends on the region and conditions in which they are grown. The coffee plant is a native to the subtropical areas of Asia and Africa. Whereas, now the coffee plant is also cultivated in Central and Latin America as well. The coffee is prepared from two types of coffee beans namely Robusta and Arabica as well as the combination of these two beans. Arabia beans have only 1.5% caffeine content compared to 2.7% in the Robusta. Moreover, in the U.S. the millennial generation are accelerating the demand for cold coffee under the influence of coffee shops which have significantly pushed the cold-serve. According to National Coffee Association, iced coffee is consumed mostly be 18 to 25 year old which is more than twice of any other age group.

Jordon Ibe scored his first Premier League goal in brilliant fashion as Liverpool warmed up for the Europa League final by rounding off their Premier League campaign with a 1-1 draw at West Brom.
 Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp named several youngsters in his XI at The Hawthorns, with the Reds due to play Sevilla in Basle on Wednesday. Victory in that match would secure them a place in the Champions League next season.
 The hosts made the most of the absence of the likes of Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino when Salomon Rondon struck the opener after brilliant work by their own youngster, Jonathan Leko.
 Liverpool went in level at the break, though, as Ibe netted his first top- flight goal with a fine solo effort, finishing calmly after showing brilliant pace down the right.
 West Brom created the better chances after the break, with Rondon particularly dangerous - including hitting the post with a header early in the second half - but Tony Pulis' men ended the season on a nine-match winless run.
 Klopp's side, meanwhile, finished eighth, but the German was able to welcome back captain Jordan Henderson and Danny Ings - who had missed one and seven months respectively with knee injuries - in the second half in a boost to Liverpool's options ahead of the continental showpiece.
 Before kick-off, Darren Fletcher and ex-Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert laid wreaths in tribute to the victims of the Hillsborough tragedy, while 96 away seats were painted red and left empty.
 When the game started, Liverpool's youngsters settled well and the lively Sheyi Ojo cut in from the left before aiming a tame 20-yard effort at Ben Foster.
 But it was a West Brom teenager who made the game's first telling contribution, Leko showed great footwork on the edge of the box before slipping in Rondon, whose near-post drive beat Adam Bogdan.
 The visitors were level in the 23rd minute, though, and in some style. Ibe gave Jonny Evans the slip on the right of the halfway line, before driving into the West Brom box and rifling low past Foster.
 Joe Allen then tried his luck from range, but his left-foot effort was sliced wide.
 West Brom went agonisingly close to retaking the lead shortly after the restart when Rondon leapt highest to head Craig Gardner's free-kick against the left-hand post, the striker's rebound on the half-volley sailing high over the top.
 Rondon continued to cause problems and the Venezuela striker just failed to make contact with Craig Dawson's cross on the hour.
 Liverpool responded by bringing on captain Henderson and Ings to a warm reception, but it was Rondon again who proved the dangerman when a stabbed shot towards goal from a corner was deflected narrowly wide.
 West Brom, who brought on youngsters Tyler Roberts and Sam Fields for their debuts, had one last chance but Dawson failed to turn in Rondon's cross-shot from close range.

Jackson perfectly exemplifies that life is bigger than football. The talented tackle prospect donated bone marrow that ultimately saved his sister's life in the summer of 2019. Due to his donation, Jackson lost a good amount of weight and missed USC’s offseason program. Upon returning to school in time for the 2019 season, Jackson started all 13 games for the Trojans but told us in Indy that he didn’t return to full-strength until halfway through the year. Jackson is a springy and explosive pass-setter that has all the athleticism to play on the left side. His feet are nimble, and his lateral slides are smooth. But his punch accuracy is inconsistent, as is his technique, which can come and go depending on the rep. Jackson doesn’t have the hand strength to latch on and redirect defenders in the running game. But he’s good on the move and in space to reach and climb as a run blocker. Jackson has starting left tackle potential.

Jawaharlal Nehru University's (JNU) two academic committees tasked with giving suggestions to ensure uninterrupted learning activities for the rest of winter semester amid the ongoing lockdown, which have been extended till May 3 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, has made several recommendations such as conducting online examinations and applying virtual learning methods and cancelling the summer vacation this year.In a report, shared with the deans of all the schools and centres in the varsity last week, Chintamani Mahapatra rector, (pro-vice- chancellor), JNU, cited all the recommendations submitted by the two panels, which were formed on April 9, to ensure completion of the courses and conducting of examinations despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The report said that JNU is likely to remain closed during the rest of the winter semester and all efforts have to be made to conduct online examinations. It, however, said that the students, who will not be able to appear for online examinations due to lack of internet connectivity, will be allowed to take them after the lockdown restrictions are lifted."Students, who will be unable to appear for examinations due to lack of internet connectivity, will be allowed to submit their assignments with a grace period. Those, who don't have internet connectivity during the lockdown period, will be permitted to appear after the restrictions are lifted. The examination pattern for the winter semester will be online and a uniform one for all the students," the report said.The committees have recommended that the evaluation process should be completed as per the academic calendar in a bid to ensure that the next semester starts on time.The panels have suggested online classes to ensure uninterrupted learning amid the lockdown. "Classes should be conducted via Zoom or other online platforms mutually convenient to a teacher and students," the report said. It has also recommended all the schools and centres to make term papers, projects, seminar papers and book reviews available online for the students.The committees have also recommended that the dates of submission of thesis for M. Phil students and Ph.D. scholars be extended in light of the prevailing lockdown. Also, the report suggested that summer vacation for this year be cancelled and conduct oral interviews for students, who qualify for JNU entrance examinations for the next academic session, via video- conferencing facility.The JNU Teachers' Association (JNUTA) joined the issue with the panels' recommendations and described them as academically and practically not feasible. The teachers' body said that JNU authorities have to adhere to the due process of approval from all the statutory bodies before implementing any of these suggestions."Even if the due process is followed, however, the report cannot be the basis for the deliberations in the different institutional bodies that are part of that process. It, in fact, doesn't offer an academically and practically viable option at all. Options, other than what it suggests, have to be considered. No matter what the compulsions, teachers cannot accept a purely formal completion of the semester that reduces it to a farce. Teachers also stand ready to make the extra effort needed to ensure proper completion of the academic requirements prescribed," the JNUTA said in a statement.No immediate comment was available from either Mahapatra or JNU registrar Pramod Kumar.

We decided to include Hopkins despite it going against the grain for the Patriots this early on in the draft. The Pats will sacrifice measurables later on at tight end but go for the in-line types in the top 100. Nevertheless, Hopkins is an excellent route runner that ran a full route tree at Purdue. He’s got great speed to run the seam, processes middle of the field reads quickly, and has terrific separation quickness at the top of routes. Hopkins is a matchup nightmare that can run routes from various alignments because of his fluidity and start-stop ability. He will not be an in-line blocker at the next level and is more in the Zach Ertz mold than a Gronk-like tight end, but he should make an immediate impact in the passing game.

All this comes as Iran continues to produce low-enriched uranium with equipment and sites barred by the nuclear deal. Its nuclear program chief recently reiterated a threat that Iran could withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, though Iran didn't make a show of its program during its recent annual National Day of Nuclear Energy.
 That bolsters suspicions of behind-the-scenes talks between intermediaries, particularly over the release of U.S. prisoners and other Westerners. Iran's judiciary acknowledged ongoing prisoner-swap discussions on April 6, without elaborating.
 But overall tensions remain extraordinarily high. Online video and Iranian media reports suggest Iran has deployed Fajr-5 missile batteries on beaches along the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded in the world passes.
 There have been reported maritime incidents in and around the strait as well. On March 27, two boats with a raised ladder approached a U.S.-flagged container ship, while Revolutionary Guard vessels approached a ship on April 2, according to private maritime security firm Dryad Global.
 The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, which routinely has tense interactions with Iranian forces. declined to comment. However, last summer saw a series of tense encounters at sea and on land that included the seizure of oil tankers.
 The U.S. pressure campaign in part seeks to force Iran into spending at home rather than on its regional allies. Tehran views such groups as part of its defensive deterrence in the region.
 Meanwhile, people continue to die of the virus in Iran in the pandemic that could spread further into American allies in the region, forcing the world to still work with Tehran, Rouhi said.
 “At the end of the day, it’s still that bad actor that is governing a country of more than 80 million," she said. "You don’t have an alternative.”

Till then there may be wisdom in following the Kerala model, chapter and verse, for many states, including Rajasthan as they begin a graded cooling-off period, post-April 20, initially for the green zones (with no cases), mainly with an eye on reviving various economic sectors. The orange zones (with a few cases) can follow later, though with abundant caution. The red zones (hotspots, etc.) may do well to see through the 40-day period, even extend it if need be. Kerala has done it in Pathanamthitta without any major disruption for the public. Even in Kasargod, Kerala's hotspot that accounts for 44 percent of its cases, the rate of recovery is three times the national figure.

Arsene Wenger was non-committal on plans to extend his contract, with the Arsenal manager insisting talks will not take place until the end of the next season.
 Wenger - out of contract at the conclusion of the 2016-17 Premier League campaign - has come under fire from sections of Arsenal's supporters following another unsuccessful title challenge.
 Arsenal's wait for a first Premier League trophy since 2004 continued as Leicester City stunned the world to claim the title, with the Londoners 12 points off the pace in third.
 Fan frustration has since risen to an all-time high in Wenger's 20-year tenure and the 66-year-old Frenchman gave no indication that he could prolong his stay beyond 2017.
 "I will wait very late, yes," Wenger said having already dismissed talks of a contract extension. "Does that mean no talks with the club next season? Exactly.
 "It's not about me, it's about the club. My role is just to serve the club as well as I can and after see where I stand and where the club is.
 "I have to forget about myself even if people who want to create unrest won't. I will continue to give my absolute best to do well next season and then after that, we'll see. Have I decided what I will do privately? No.
 "I extended my contract in a period that was vital for the club and after that I will see where I am personally and where the club stands at the end of my contract."
