Phil Jackson sat on the sidelines for one year after the Bulls dynasty ended. It wasn’t long before he grew restless and identified a new challenge. Jackson joined the Lakers and helped elevate Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, adding five titles in 11 years.
 Similar to the Bulls before them, turmoil ended the Lakers’ first title run as O’Neal and Bryant couldn’t see eye to eye. Bryant flirted with the Bulls and even wore Jordan jerseys in public. Bryant met with the Bulls in July 2004 and was sold on the move to Chicago. “We were looking at houses, we were looking at schools,” Bryant told the Tribune in December 2004. “We already were talking about a sign-and-trade.”

Although it may be nice to have the NBA slowly coming back to action, basketball is not the only topic that holds a spotlight. Social justice does too. When the games start fans will also see ‘Black Lives Matter’ on the courts in Orlando. Coach Brooks expressed this movement playing a significant role in their game, “It’s extremely important, and it’s the right thing to do. I’m all for it. Black Lives Matter is important. I think our players, our staff, our organization, ownership group, the NBA, the country, we wanna see change.” When Beal was asked if resuming basketball would take away from social justice he said, “”I feel like we stopped playing basketball because of COVID. We didn’t stop playing because of social justice. And I feel like we can still raise that awareness.” He further shined a light on how basketball could be used as a viable platform to attract attention to social justice like utilizing the names on the back of player jerseys to actively staying involved with local officials, lawmakers, politicians, “…we have to utilize our platform as athletes to speak out for those unheard, to be vocal, to show face, to evolve. I think we’re able to do both…”

“We all have assumptions, biases, and stereotypes, based on race, gender, sexual orientation, occupation, how someone talks, dresses, and so on. This is normal and does not make us a bad person,” said Schlosser.
 “These biases can exist in our subconscious and affect our decision making and actions. All of our life experiences like upbringing, family, the media, social media, and our identity, contribute to our beliefs and attitudes. We need to be aware of this and work on our biases.
 “Actually, I believe that developing relationships and friendships with people that are different than you is the best way to begin ridding ourselves of our biases.”
 “When recruit officers leave PTI, I want them to have a better understanding of those that may be different than them — have different beliefs, ideologies, and world views,” he added. “Hopefully, through this understanding, there will be greater and empathy and respect toward everyone in their community.”
 Before Michael Brown Jr., 18, a Black man, was fatally shot by White police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014, in what Wilson believed was self-defense as he responded to a theft in progress, Schlosser was making changes to the PTI curriculum, focusing on community policing and bias awareness.
 Wilson was never charged with a crime, a decision that sparked protests, some violent, in Ferguson and in other cities around the country.
 PTI is differentSchlosser said as one of the seven police training academies in Illinois, the 65-year-old PTI has some marked differences from its counterparts.
 One is that being part of a major research university allows for collaboration and research on police practices.
 As director, Schlosser is involved with faculty from the UI and other universities in such research areas as police officer wellness, virtual reality aimed at reducing the use of deadly force, defensive tactics and the development of a ‘police moral risk scale’ for use as a potential tool before an officer is hired and in measuring fitness for duty.
 Another difference in PTI’s training is the use of the “adult learning model” as opposed to a paramilitary approach.
 “It makes no sense to have exaggerated strictness and yell at recruit officers for 14 weeks and expect them to go out on the street and treat citizens with respect and empathy,” he said. “All of our instructors mimic how we want our recruit officers to treat citizens.

Guy who did it is a dickhead, and it's not over the top to mention it and to say so. After the bellend firing fireworks at the Liver buildings we could do without people doing inane bullshit.      Doesn't mean we need to feel guilty for it necessarily as we didn't do anything wrong personally but it's not justifiable and we should self police more. Perhaps they won't care but if the person that did it noticed they got a lot of condemnation from their own fanbase rather than laughter and pats on the back, perhaps the next idiot will think twice.

Der Sänger wolle „all seine Konzentration dafür aufwenden, sein Leben wieder in den Griff zu bekommen.“ Der Entschluss sei gemeinsam gefasst worden. „Tom habe mit persönlichen Problemen zu kämpfen gehabt, die sein Verhalten nun schon seit geraumer Zeit beeinflusst haben.“ Weitere Kommentare zur Lage solle es laut Statement nicht geben. Die Frage wird nun sein, ob Kasabian auch ohne den 39-Jährigen weitermachen – mit einem Album oder einer Tour. Die letzte Platte, „For Crying Out Loud“, erschien 2017. Zuletzt war Meighan immer wieder von Nervenzusammenbrüchen…

We have our idiots and whoever put the flare on that statue is a stupid idiot - i'd go no further than that. I'd save the stronger words for racists, paedos and murderers. No need for the Echo to hyperventilate and get statements from Dixies family.      You have to remember that bluenoses are a prickly bunch and get a bit tetchy over things like a statue, we've seen it in the past when someone has stuck a red scarf round Dixies neck when we've won a cup or something - totally harmless and not like desecration of a grave or something but bluenoses go mad, foam at the mouth and write strongly worded letters to the Echo.      I can honestly say that if Everton won a cup and some wag put a blue scarf around Shankly or the Paisley statue it wouldn't bother me in the slightest, yes i'd be more annoyed if a hand flare was placed there but I wouldn't be foaming and wouldn't expect our local paper to hyperventilate and keep stirring things.
