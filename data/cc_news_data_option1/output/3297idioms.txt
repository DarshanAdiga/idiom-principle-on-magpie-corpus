 The counties given the green light are Apache, Cochise, Coconino and Yavapai. Cities in those counties include Flagstaff, Prescott and Sierra Vista.
 The state’s other 11 counties, including Maricopa, which includes Phoenix, and Pima, where Tucson is located, still haven't cleared benchmarks based on case numbers, testing positivity and hospital visits. The virus outbreak has eased after Arizona became a national hotspot in June and July.

By now you are probably wondering what the heck does this have to do with textiles? Well there is a textile that has bark! Barkcloth is made not from the loud dogs’ vocals but from the bark of trees! Many a home in the 1940-1950’s had drapes made from this uneven woven fabric that created its distinct, tweedy, rough, texture. Originally the fabric was made in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands from the inner bark of trees. The bark was soaked and pounded into a thin layer of “paper-like fabric” and decorated using dyes and/or paint.
