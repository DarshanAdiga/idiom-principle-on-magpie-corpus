Sardiello said that watching the sailors board the ship was a great feeling, But he knows he's not done yet. There are still about 350 sailors on Guam who are either in isolation or are there as support staff.
 "More and more of those sailors are meeting the return-to-work criteria, and we're flying them on board every single day. So we're whittling down that number day by day," said Sardiello. "But I really want those 350 remaining back. And we're working hard on that."
 He said that any sailors who don't recover in time will be transported back to the U.S. The ship is expected to continue operations in the Pacific, and then would likely head home to San Diego later this summer.
 The Roosevelt has been at the center of a still unresolved controversy that led to the firing of the ship's previous captain, the resignation of the Navy secretary and an expanded investigation into what triggered the outbreak and how well top naval commanders handled it.
 Sardiello, had previously captained the Roosevelt but was abruptly sent back to the ship in early April to take command after Capt. Brett Crozier was fired for urging his commanders to take faster action to stem the virus outbreak onboard.
 After a preliminary review last month, Adm. Mike Gilday, the Navy's top officer, recommended that Crozier be reinstated as ship captain. But the Navy decided to conduct the broader investigation.
 That review, which effectively delays a decision on Crozier's reinstatement, was finished and submitted to Gilday at the end of March and he is still reviewing the extensive report, which includes several hundred pages of interviews, documents and recommendations.
 Cmdr. Nate Christensen, spokesman for Gilday, said is will take time for the admiral to finish his review and make any decisions.

The Roosevelt pulled into Guam on March 27, with a rapidly escalating number of sailors testing positive for the virus. Over time, more than 1,000 were infected with COVID-19, setting off a lengthy and systematic process to move about 4,000 sailors ashore for quarantine and treatment, while about 800 remained aboard to protect and run the high-tech systems, including the nuclear reactors that run the vessel.
 Slowly, sailors were methodically brought back on board, while the others who had remained went ashore for their mandated two-week quarantine. And in late March, the ship with only about 3,000 crew aboard went out to sea for roughly two weeks of training, including the recertification of the flight deck and fighter squadron, such as takeoffs and landings on the carrier.
 Earlier this week, the Roosevelt wrapped up training and returned to Guam to pick up nearly 1,000 sailors who had been left there to either complete their quarantine or to manage and work with those still on the island. As the ship sailed into the port, it was flying a flag with the words "Don't Give Up the Ship," a famous Navy battle cry from the War of 1812.
 "Our sailors didn't give up the ship. They fought and got it back. So I thought it was appropriate," said Sardiello, who asked one of the other Navy ships to borrow their flag. "The ship was clean and the ship was healthy with no COVID cases. So I said, OK, we're going to fly that one time on the way into Guam as a symbol to bolster their morale."
 RS1 Katie VanDrimmelen was one of the sailors left ashore during the two-week training. She had tested positive for the virus and was in quarantine for about five weeks. Walking back onto the ship, she said, was like being welcomed home from a deployment.
 "It was amazing," said VanDrimmelen, of Ogden, Utah. "It was very comforting to be back in our normal atmosphere. Everybody was happy."

To @realdonaldtrump Through my ongoing conversations with friends, teammates, and leaders in the black community, I realize this is not an issue about the American flag. It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial & prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation’s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.

Hodges hasn’t issued a public statement of his own on Twitter, though he has retweeted statements from Texas A&M women’s basketball coach Gary Blair, A&M football coach Jimbo Fisher and former NFL head coach Tony Dungy. Hodges said the important thing to him is to be there for his players and not sound hollow when talking with them about social injustices.
 “Most importantly is you got to let the guys know that you’re there for them,” Hodges said. “Especially coming as a white coach to an African American player, it’s not really my position at this time and place to give them advice. It’s my place to listen to them and say, ‘I’m here for you, and whatever it takes, I’m going to be here for you. I’m here to listen. I’m here to empathize.’ I don’t have that same perspective. We’re all in the same family, but I don’t know what it’s like to walk in their shoes.”
 Hodges’ approach is being mirrored by Rudder football coach Eric Ezar and Bryan boys basketball coach Johnathan Hines, both of whom are white. But with UIL-sanctioned activities suspended until Monday, navigating such a personal conversation with players has proven difficult.
 Like most coaches, Ezar said his primary goal is to positively affect the lives of his players. He frames that mission with the Rangers’ motto — better men, better husbands, better fathers — and gives the team’s player leadership council plenty of latitude in helping the team both on and off the field.
 A significant portion of both the team and leadership council is black. Ezar said he didn’t have anything specific planned to discuss with his players when workouts resume Monday but would see what the leadership council wants to talk about and likely let the 10-player group lead any team discussions regarding racial injustice.
 Hines said he and his staff have reached out to the players regarding Floyd’s tragic death and the national reaction, extending an offer of open communication. So far the coach hasn’t spoken with any individual player, but he emphasized the importance of togetherness for his team.
 “We value everyone and have built a culture of acceptance in our program,” Hines said. “I’ve been blessed with an amazing staff that mentors our young men and demonstrates how or community should treat one another. The Bryan Viking message during this difficult time is to come together and support one another. We are one.”

"I'm not one for the dramatic." So says Elisabeth Moss in her Bette Davis-lite portrayal of author Shirley Jackson in the starkly titled "Shirley." That statement is ironic since most of Josephine Decker's follow-up to 2018's "Madeline's Madeline" is a succession of actorly hysterics in service of a Gothic soap opera brimming with lesbian undertones.
 Men! Who needs them? That's the theme driving a script by Sarah Gubbins (TV's "I Love Dick") in which she converts Susan Scarf Merrell's like-titled novel into a dull, plodding fever dream of fact cut with a steady dose of fiction. Yet, her protofeminist approach peculiarly carries as much disdain for her female characters as it does for the feckless, unfaithful men they "love."

 So, what's to like? I'm still kicking that around in my head. Is my ho-hum reaction to "Shirley" due to the underwhelming narrative or the fact that Decker is that rare director whose status as a critical favorite utterly escapes me, a list she's joined on by Benh Zeitlin ("Beasts of the Southern Wild") and Luca Guadagnino ("Call Me by Your Name").
 At least "Shirley" is watchable, praise I'd never foist upon her impenetrable "Madeline's Madeline," although the two works spring from the same idea of real-life trauma inspiring a wicked-brand of artistic expression. In this case, the muse is Shirley's new house guest, Rose Nemser (sinewy Odessa Young), who travels to sleepy Bennington, Vt., with her aspiring professor husband, Fred (Logan Lerman), to begin married life residing with a couple that's perhaps been wedded far too long. Naturally, the interlopers are catnip for Shirley, a self-proclaimed provocateur, and her pretentious, blowhard husband Stanley Edgar Hyman (Michael Stuhlbarg overdoing the smarm).
 From the get-go, you know the reputable scholars will make quick work of the Nemsers and their newlywed bliss. They never have a chance; which makes the eventual standoff between the elders and the naive kids the equivalent of a lopsided football game. That's assuming the pigskin ever gets tossed around at tony Bennington College, an "all-girls" school where Stanley and Fred teach folklore to a bevy of 1950-era beauties open to a little sis boom bah.
 In turn, Shirley and her new gullible companion, Rose - hired to cook, clean and keep tabs on her reclusive host - conspire to push their men back, push them back, way back. With good reason we learn via Fred's late night dates with bottles of gin and Stanley's countless episodes of passive-aggressive digs delivered on the rare occasion he's not out schtupping the dean's prissy wife.
 The goal, apparently, is something akin to "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" cross pollinated with "The Shining," as Shirley sneers, swills booze and attacks her typewriter as if it's a stand-in for Stanley's face. I think it's Decker's intent to examine how the outside world directly informs the artist, as Shirley - fresh off her acclaimed short story, "The Lottery" - draws inspiration for her psychological thriller, 1951's "The Hangsaman," via the real-life disappearance of Bennington College freshman Paula Jean Welden.
 As the novel progresses, the now pregnant Rose - under the heavy influence of smokes and drink - finds herself increasingly identifying with Paula Jean, a woman who had to vanish to finally be seen. As hard as they try, Decker and Gubbins never sell the analogy, despite Moss and Young working their butts off. Both are as excellent as Stuhlbarg and Lerman are unlikable and lifeless. Why did these ballsy women marry such drips? Who knows, and "Shirley" isn't about to tell you. True to most of Jackson's writings, it's a mystery.

College Station football coach Steve Huff said he and his staff held meetings this week in preparation for team workouts. Huff said the coaches were going to discuss a way to address Floyd’s death and the nationwide protest with the team.
 As local white coaches work with their teams to discuss racial injustice, black coaches speak from experience in conversations with their players and families.
 Allen Academy football coach Adrian Adams led discussions with his team Monday and Tuesday — the first two days of TAPPS-sanctioned workouts.
 “The main thing is they have to understand that they have to be aware of what’s going on in the world,” Adams said. “We don’t live in a bubble in our society, no matter where you are, what you do or how you do it. I don’t know if it’s their duty as athletes to affect change, but I think they take some of that responsibility on themselves. They have to know how those kinds of things impact their lives, whether it’s right in front of them or not.”
 Adams said he takes his role as a coach seriously when it comes to having tough conversations and helping his players grow as people. He said he’s hopeful that coaches at all levels will shine light on the issues of injustice to affect action and positive change.
 “Coaches have statements and athletic departments have statements, but at the end of the day, it’s actions,” Adams said. “If you’re not following through and showing those things on a daily basis, it’s kind of all for not. I’m not saying anything negative against anyone that sent out a statement, but I think that’s the most important thing. You’ve got to live it every single day.”
 A&M Consolidated boys basketball assistant coach Jeremy Cunningham echoed Adams’ sentiments, saying that for the most part, “People will treat you according to how you act and carry yourself.” But there are times where that doesn’t matter to some people, which can make even some of life’s simple pleasures stressful.
 “As a parent, the joy of your child getting a driver’s license and being able to drive doesn’t last very long,” Cunningham said. “The more he drives, the more likely he’ll have an encounter with someone who doesn’t value his life the way his family does.”
 Cunningham, who is black and previously served as an assistant coach at Rudder when his son, KJ, played there, said the Consol staff hasn’t talked to its players about the protests, feeling it’s best to keep their spirits uplifted until workouts resume. But he said both his son and players realize the dissonance that often presents itself, especially for blacks, when social injustices meet athletics.
 “As an athlete, don’t confuse tolerance as acceptance,” Cunningham said. “As long as you can dribble and score, you’ll be cheered for. But when the uniform comes off, [we’ve seen] the rest. All in all, we’re going to try our best to govern ourselves in line with our Christian beliefs and pray everyone else does the same.”

 Independence answered with four runs, taking advantage of a leadoff walk to No. 9 hitter Tucker.
 Central Connecticut State’s Kanios, Vazquez and Vargas had hits. Singles by Vazquez and Vargas plated runs sandwiched around a sacrifice fly by San Jose State’s Ruben Ibarra. A groundout by Louisiana Tech’s Manny Garcia scored the fourth run.
 Unity scored a run in the fourth without a hit to pull within 4-3. A fielder’s choice by Florida’s Isaac Nunez scored Lipscomb’s Maddux Houghton who walked and went to third on a two-base throwing error by first baseman Ibarra.
 Independence third baseman Troy Viola had two dandy plays in the fourth inning. He short-hopped a slow roller and made an accurate off-balance throw on the run to prevent Rombach to reach to start the inning. Viola ended the inning by flagging down a hard-hit grounder to his left. He spun around and used a head-first slide to take the bag for a force out before the runner.

CSBI organizers said it also didn’t hurt to have an Aggie in an event that lacked current A&M players.
 “I’m surprised they didn’t let them [participate],” Walters said of his former A&M teammates.
 Playing time played a big factor in Walters’ decision to transfer as well as the desire for a change in coaching, he said.
 “I love the coaching staff [at Angelo State],” Walters said. “Coach Brooks and [assistant coach Adam Foster] do a really good job with all the players, and they make it more fun. I think that makes us good as a team.”
 In the first night of the tournament Thursday, Walters went 0 for 3 with two walks. Seeing live pitching for the first time in months, he said the hitters expected to be behind the pitchers.
 “There was a lot of hitters yesterday late on fastballs, and you could tell that the hitters were a little rusty,” he said. “It just takes a little bit of time.”
 But that special connection with a pitcher, even ones he just met days prior, is what has caught the eye of most involved with the CSBI.
 “He’s just real calm and under control, and he did a good job of controlling the game,” Walter’s CSBI teammate and pitcher Travis Hester said. “It’s the first time he’s ever caught me, but we were on the same page with really everything. I don’t think I shook him once.”

“Giant gave us a big percentage off and we ran it through a wholesale, but still giving big props to Jason,” said Jonathon Hunt, co-owner of Barrie’s. “It’s just really cool to see these kids work towards a goal and see a lot of them come through, and for some of them it’s the only way they’re getting a bike. So it’s just really cool to see them earn what they wanted.”
 A few years back, however, the program hit a small bump which resulted in a two-year gap where there was no program for the students to earn a reward.
 “We did (the program) six, seven years ago and did it for four years straight and then there was a gentleman who wanted to expand it to more schools…and we told him he could,” Meador said. “He did it for two years and then got out of it, so nobody has done it for the past two years. We decided to get back into it and do it this year, and we’re planning on doing it regularly after this.”
 While the incentive for the students to strive towards perfect attendance was a new bike, the goals they achieved also helps the school district in the long run, Meador said.
 “One great thing we really like about this is that schools get some of their state funding based off attendance,” he said. “So by us being able to help with getting their attendance better … it helps each one of the elementary schools actually get more money from the state to be able to buy things for the schools and for the kids.”
 According to Craney, Meador was committed to educating the students about the program and the importance of not missing days at school and worked throughout the school year to remind the students the rewards of achieving perfect attendance.
 “We appreciate the Meadors. We know it takes a lot of time,” Craney said. “It’s a lot to organize. It’s a lot of money out of their pockets, but it’s definitely a commitment they have and you can tell how passionate they are. Jason came out at the beginning of the school year to every school and talked to the kids and challenged them. And every school had a bike in it and sign so that they could keep it there throughout the school year to remind the students about it.”
 “He made another little video half way through the year that the schools shared to encourage students,” she continued. “And this week he and his staff have been open every day to let the students pick up their bike. They’re really dedicated.”
 Meador recognized that for some of the students, if they didn’t earn the bike through their perfect attendance, they wouldn’t have one.
 “It’s been very rewarding on our end to see that and being able to give kids one of their first bikes,” he said. “We always loved doing it (in the past) because it’s a great thing for the students. It really pushes them to get perfect attendance when otherwise they probably wouldn’t.”

It may seem like this mole must have an incredible sense of smell to go along with such a schnoz. Those 22 rays are used more for touch than for smell, however. Each ray is covered with unique and highly sensitive touch receptors called Eimer’s organs. These organs are found on the snouts of other mole species, but the star-nosed mole is the superstar when it comes to this organ. The species’ most well-known researcher, Kenneth Catania, said a star-nosed mole’s snout contains more than 100,000 of these sensory neurons, and described “the star (as) probably the most sensitive and highly acute touch organ found on any mammal.”
 Video footage of star-nosed moles shows them in their damp tunnels, with their snout out front, sweeping from side to side and touching the tunnel from top to bottom. These moles are voracious predators, consuming 50% or more of their body mass each day. When encountering a choice morsel, like an earthworm, it moves in swiftly to eat.
 Catania noticed that star-nosed moles consistently touch their prey with one pair of rays in particular. The 11th rays can, in a sense, see the prey as well as feel it. Catania’s studies of star-nosed moles’ brain development show these rays, the smallest of the mole’s appendages, represent the largest part of the mole’s brain, similar to the way vision is represented in other animals’ cortexes.
 I haven’t seen another star-nosed mole since that spring day in the marsh. But each year I go back exactly to where I sat that day. I still get lost in the way winter yields to spring as I sit on that rock. But I am really there hoping for one more glimpse of this silky mole who feels and sees with its starry snout.

L'uomo sarebbe stato all'improvviso scaraventato a terra, con gli agenti che continuavano ad infierire. Per la polizia sarebbe stato invece l'uomo ad aggredire i poliziotti. Nei giorni scorsi e arrivato il risultato dell'autopsia: si e trattato di omicidio e Manuel Ellis e morto per un arresto respiratorio. Secondo quanto riporta il _New York Times_ , la testimone contesta la versione fornita dalla polizia, secondo cui Ellis avrebbe afferrato un agente e lo avrebbe scaraventato a terra. Secondo la donna, invece, l'uomo avrebbe iniziato una conversazione con i poliziotti ma all'improvviso i toni sarebbero cambiati e uno degli agenti avrebbe colpito Ellis con la portiera dell'auto.

But the plan backfired. As it turned out, cane toads can't jump very high, so they couldn't eat the beetles that lived in the upper stalks of the plants. Instead, they ate pretty much everything else, including bird's eggs and small mammals. And their poisonous glands ensured that would-be predators stayed away.

Mati Gómez es de Chile y apuesta por el sonido urbano, en su presentación al resto de los países de América Latina no puede tener mejores padrinos: el grupo mexicano Reik y el reguetonero Nicky Jam, con quienes interpreta Yo no sé, canción inspirada en la persona especial que llega a tu vida a cambiar el panorama amoroso.
 “Fue una sorpresa para mí que lanzarán en las plataformas digitales la canción en remix. Yo no me lo esperaba. Son artistas a los que he admirado sus trayectorias y han sido mis influencias musicales. Soy fan de ellos, ahora que los conozco puedo decir que son mis referentes y ahora como mis padrinos que me dan la bienvenida en el mundo musical”.
 “Los integrantes de Reik son como se ven, igual de simpáticos y profesionales en la música. Eso lleva a uno, a emularlos y mirarlos con respeto. A eso le apuesto en grande en mi vida musical”, declara.
 Mati no sólo admira las baladas románticas de México, también la música ranchera y sin traicionar su origen urbano, no dudará darse un gusto cuando esté consolidado en su género, uno de sus propósitos es hacer una colaboración con Vicente Fernández, según comentó en entrevista con El Sol de México.
 “De la música de México mi ídolo es Vicente Fernández. De él me gusta Vale más un buen amor, cuya letra bien podrá ser para nuestro dueto, me encantaría cumplir mi sueño anhelado. Estoy abierto a todos los sonidos, el día de mañana quiero ser un artista versátil. Escucho también lo que está haciendo el mexicano Christian Nodal que está rompiendo récord de visitas con sus canciones.
 Mati, con dos años de vida profesional en la música también quiere sobresalir en la composición, se está soltando y ya colabora en sus temas que saldrán pronto en un álbum debut. “Más que componer solo, me gusta trabajar en equipo y ahí voy soltando”.
 El intérprete de Yo no sé, confía que las letras de temas de reguetón dejen de agredir y ofender a las mujeres. “Lo ideal es que se pondere a la mujer en el sonido romántico, y no se le relacione con palabras obscenas. Ahora J. Balvin, Maluma, el propio Nicky están cambiando sus canciones, está evolucionando como parte de ese cambio. En mi caso, mi álbum debut contaré con una de sonido reguetón, se llama Vente pa’cá”.
