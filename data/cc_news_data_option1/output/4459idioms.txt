"The limited uptake and use of climate information services in development planning and practice in Africa is due in part to the paucity of reliable and timely climate information. This report, focusing on Africa, will go a long way towards addressing this gap. The contribution of the Economic Commission for Africa to the production of this report, through the African Climate Policy Centre, seeks to highlight the nexus between climate change and development, and to emphasise that building forward better from the Covid-19 pandemic requires a development approach that is green, sustainable and climate resilient, informed by the best available science. The participation of multiple institutions and agencies in producing the report reinforces our principles and approaches of working as one," said H.E. Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.

COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Voters on Tuesday will choose to give Republican Gov. Mike Parson a full four years in charge of Missouri or to give the job to Democrat Nicole Galloway, in a race that shaped up as a referendum on Parson's approach to the coronavirus pandemic and the candidates' competing visions of the future of policing in the state. The election, which could be Democrats’ best chance of flipping a governor’s seat this year, marks voters' first chance to weigh in on Parson's leadership of the state. He ascended to the governorship two years ago after his Republican predecessor, Eric Greitens, resigned under a cloud of scandal and with impeachment a possibility. Much of the race between Parson and Galloway, the state auditor, has centered on the pandemic and crime. Galloway has been critical of Parson’s handling of the pandemic. He allowed Missouri businesses to largely reopen in mid-June, and the number of confirmed cases rose. Meanwhile, hospitalizations began to spike in September and have remained high. Unlike his counterparts in many states, Parson also refused to issue an order requiring people wear face masks in public to slow the spread of the virus and he has often appeared in public without one. He and his wife, who are both in their 60s, tested positive for COVID-19 on Sept. 23, but neither developed serious symptoms. At a recent candidate forum in Columbia, Galloway said Parson had “failed the test of leadership.” Parson has defended what he calls his balanced approach to the pandemic that is aimed at keeping the economy going while fighting the spread of the disease. He has pointed to Missouri’s relatively low unemployment rate compared to other states’, its quick recovery of many jobs that were lost at the outset of the pandemic, and consumer-spending levels that are at or near...

AUD/USD remains on the offer despite RBA's Lowe downplaying the need for negative rates. The central bank head said the bank will do more if needed. The RBA cut rates to a new record low of 0.10% early Tuesday. The bear grip around the Aussie dollar remains strong, keeping the AUD/USD pairin the red despite theReserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) governor Lowe saying that negative rates are'extraordinarily unlikely'. Lowe was out on the wires sharing his thoughts on the RBA's latest decision to reduce rates to a new record low of 0.10% and the three-year bond yield target to 0.10% and the future course of action. Key quotes It's possible for RBA to increase the size of bond purchases. Negative rates are still extraordinarily unlikely. If we need to do more, we can and we will. So far, the markets are not impressed by Lowe's downplaying of the need for negative rates., possibly because the central bank head stressed the bank'swillingness to do more if needed. At press time, the pair is trading near 0.7038, having dropped from 0.7063 to 0.7028 following the RBA's rate cut announcement early today. The pair may recover the lost ground if the global equities gain ground as hinted by the uptick in the S&P 500 futures. However, a big rally looks unlikely, courtesy of the US election uncertainty.

Democrats haven't won the governor's office since 1988. Though Burgum seems to have an easy path to keeping that streak alive, the wealthy tech executive- turned-governor has come under increased criticism from Democrat Shelley Lenz and medical professionals for his management of the coronavirus pandemic. Burgum insists the state has done a good job in handling the virus even as its spread ranks among the worst in the nation. Burgum has touted a "light touch" by government and has refused to mandate masks or enforceable limits on gatherings of any kind. Burgum, considered a small-town North Dakota success story, won in 2016 by running as an outsider who would "reinvent government." He has often been at odds with his own party, and has tapped his own wallet to try to take down a lawmaker who hasn't been on board with his priorities.

That's slower than Jaguar's claim for the I-Pace (4.8 seconds) and Mercedes-Benz's EQC (5.1 seconds) but it still feels lively off the mark and strong when asked to overtake, thanks to oodles of low-down torque. There is a slight delay when you plant the throttle but in-gear acceleration betters all but the sportiest of petrol and diesel-powered SUVs. It's an eerie sensation accelerating that quickly without the usual soundtrack of an engine, but the silence suits a luxury SUV.

That’s a hard thing to do as an artist, so I think for me releasing a song like that is super empowering. It shows people ‘oh, someone else feels the same way I do’ so the whole experience, whether the songs were sad or not, has been a really empowering thing for me, especially as a woman in the industry.

EUR/USD witnessed some follow-through selling for the sixth consecutive session on Monday. Coronavirus jitters continued benefitting the safe-haven USD, which exerted some pressure. The uncertainty US political situation capped the USD upside and helped limit deeper losses. The EUR/USD pair remained depressed for the sixth consecutive session on Monday and dropped to fresh multi-week lows, albeit lacked any strong follow-through selling. Concerns about the potential economic fallout from coronavirus- induced lockdowns in Europe kept the euro bulls on the defensive and drove some haven flows towards the US dollar. Growing market worries overshadowed encouraging European data, showing that the German Manufacturing PMI rose to a 31-month high level of 58.2. Adding to this, the Eurozone Manufacturing PMI was finalized at a 27 months high level of 54.8 in October, albeit did little to provide any meaningful impetus to the shared currency. On the other hand, the USD buying interest picked up pace following the release of better-than- expected ISM Manufacturing PMI. In fact, the gauge surged to the highest level since September 2018 and came in at 59.3 in October. The rise of 3.9 points from the previous month's reading of 55.4 was the second-largest since May 2009 and signalled a strong growth momentum in the US manufacturing sector. Despite the supporting factors, the USD bulls refrained from placing aggressive bets amid the uncertain US political environment. This, in turn, helped limit deeper losses, rather assisted the pair to once again find some support ahead of the 1.1600 mark. The pair continued showing some resilience at lower levels and managed to regain some positive traction during the Asian session on Tuesday. The uptick, however, lacked any strong follow-through as investors might opt to stay on the sidelines rather than betting outright on a particular result of the US election. It is worth reporting that the incoming opinion polls have consistently shown Democrat challenger Joe Biden leading Republican incumbent President Donald Trump. Investors, however, remain wary of predicting the actual outcome on the back of a narrow gap in battleground states. That said, some repositioning trade ahead of the key event risk might still infuse some volatility amid absent relevant market moving economic releases. Short-term technical outlook From a technical perspective, nothing seems to have changed much for the pair and the near-term bias still seems tilted in favour of bearish traders. However, the emergence of some buying ahead of September monthly swing lows warrant some caution, making it prudent to wait for some follow-through selling before positioning for any further depreciating move. A convincing breakthrough the 1.1615-10 region, leading to a subsequent slide below the 1.1600 mark might now turn the pair vulnerable to accelerate the fall further towards the key 1.1500 psychological mark, with some intermediate support near the 1.1540-35 region. On the flip side, the attempted recovery move might still be seen as a selling opportunity and runs the risk of fizzling out rather quickly near the 1.1690-1.1700 region. Above the mentioned barrier, a fresh bout of short-covering has the potential to lift the pair back towards a one-month-old ascending trend-line support breakpoint, now turned resistance, currently near mid-1.1700s.
