BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. energy consumption plummeted to its lowest level in more than 30 years this spring as the nation’s economy largely shut down because of the coronavirus, federal officials reported Wednesday.The drop was driven by less demand for coal that is burned for electricity and oil that’s refined into gasoline and jet fuel, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.The declines were in line with lower energy usage around the globe as the pandemic seized up economies. Those trends are expected to turn around as commercial activity resumes, but an annual decline in U.S. and global greenhouse gas emissions is expected and some energy companies already have fallen into bankruptcy.Overall U.S. energy consumption dropped 14 percent during April compared to a year earlier, the energy administration said. That’s the lowest monthly level since 1989 and the largest decrease ever recorded in data that’s been collected since 1973.The largest drop previously seen was in December 2001, after the Sept. 11 attacks shocked the economy and a mild winter further depressed electricity demand.During this spring’s energy consumption downturn, natural gas usage bucked the trend among fossil fuels and increased 15 percent during the April lockdown as residential consumption increased with most of the nation under stay-at-home orders.Petroleum consumption fell to 14.7 million barrels a day in April, down almost a third compared to the same period in 2019. Demand already has rebounded some after stay-at-home orders expired and large sectors of the economy started moving again.Led by people returning to their old driving habits, petroleum consumption in June was back up to 17.6 million barrels a day, according to the American Petroleum Institute. But new drilling activity continued to be weak, declining in June for the seventh month in a row to 11 million barrels daily as stockpiles of oil and petroleum products remained near record levels.“While we are not out of the woods yet, we do appear to be headed in the right direction,” said Dean Foreman, the industry group’s chief economist.Coal companies are expected to have a tougher time than petroleum producers recovering from the pandemic, which hit as the coal sector remained on a fairly steady downward spiral since 2007 despite President Donald Trump’s attempts to prop it up.Coal consumption fell 27 percent in April compared to the same period in 2019, to 27 million tons. Most coal produced in the U.S. is used to generate electricity but many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar.The energy administration projects overall consumption will increase for the rest of 2020 but remain below 2019 levels.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Dr. Renuga Vivekanandan, an infectious disease physician with CHI Health, said coronavirus transfers from an animal to humans and has four different strains. She said the strains usually are prevalent in winter as part of the common cold, but that COVID-19 is different.
 “What is new about COVID-19 is it is the novel coronavirus,” Vivekanandan said. “So you and I have never had exposure to this and do not have any antibodies to this. We need to protect each other until we are able to have vaccines or antiviral medications.”
 She said it is important for teachers — and people in general — to protect themselves from COVID-19 by wearing a face covering, maintaining a 6-foot social distance and washing their hands often. Some people are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, meaning it is important for people to wear a face mask to protect themselves against the coronavirus.
 “When it comes to children, the COVID-19 cases are very low,” Vivekanandan said. “There have been kids who have gotten severe infections, but those are related to when they have had underlying health issues. Kids are at a lower risk for getting COVID-19; however, adults like teachers and staff are at higher risk.”
 She said there have been a number of discussions about whether kids should wear face masks. As an infectious disease physician, she believes it is OK for kids to wear them.
 Vivekanandan said there are concerns about whether kids will retain carbon dioxide and get enough oxygen, but studies show kids are getting enough oxygen when wearing a face mask.
 Dr. David Quimby, another infectious disease physician with CHI Health, said face masks do not need to be changed out after a few hours “unless it is becoming soiled, wet with something or there is a physical issue with it.”
 Quimby said that if an individual is using a cloth mask, they should wash it at the end of the day.
 He said a face mask can make it difficult for students to inhale but exercising outside without a mask should be OK as long as they are maintaining a 6-foot social distance. Students should be fine not wearing a mask in a large gym setting if they are spread apart.
 When students resume in-person learning in the fall, Quimby said, “there is no way” desks can be 6 feet apart with the number of students in the classroom. This, he said, is why wearing face masks is important.
 “I am aware that some districts are not having a mandatory masking policy,” he said. “So if there are students who are not wearing masks, it might be safer for them to do more solo activities than in a small group because they are not able to have that extra barrier of protection. So, ideally, it is good to have as few people in a group as possible. If you are in a small group, I would think masking is very important there.”
