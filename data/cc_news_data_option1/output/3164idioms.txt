With three top-10 finishes under his belt already this season, the Aussie had reason to be optimistic — “I feel like the game is slowly coming around,” Day said afterward — but also good reason to keep an eye out over his shoulder. Among the nine names clustered at 66 heading into Friday’s second round were: Brooks Koepka, a big-game performer seeking to become the first golfer in 64 years to win the same major three times in a row; Xander Schauffle, a rising star on the game’s biggest stages; and a few former, but still formidable major winners — Justin Rose, Martin Kaymer and Zach Johnson.

For decades, Billy Mitchell has been the face of joystick dominance. He set his first _Donkey Kong_ high-score record back in 1982 with 874,300 points. In June 2005, he became the first player to ever score more than 1 million points in the game, an accomplishment that was chronicled in the 2007 documentary _King of Kong_. Mitchell continued to top his own world record in the years after, scoring 1,050,200 points in 2007 and 1,062,800 in 2010. All of these scores made him a Guinness mainstay over the years, but murmurs about their legitimacy have been around for just as long.

Dear Dave,   My in-laws have very generously offered my wife and me $250,000 to help with a down payment on a home. I know the amount exceeds the IRS's yearly gift allowance, but they want to structure it as a family loan and have already told us they don't care if we pay it back. If we accept, we technically owe them a lot of money. If we say no, they may be offended. What do you think about this and how it might impact the relationship?   James
 Dear James,   Well, it makes sense your wife would be on board with the whole thing. It's her dad making the offer, so of course, she would be a lot more comfortable with the idea than you are.
 This is a big deal, and it's something you two should have a very serious conversation about. Get on the same page in every regard. Also, I'd recommend making sure you get everything in writing. See to it, as well, that it can be forgiven at the maximum allowable annual gift rate.
 In addition, in the event of death, make sure it's included in the estate, it's forgiven and there will be zero call on the note. In effect, that would make it an advance on your inheritance instead of debt. Under no circumstances should they, or any other heirs, have grounds to call the note.
 That's a good question, James. And a nice gift!   Dave
 Keeping the side hustle alive
    Dear Dave,   I have a full-time job, but I also have a side job providing firewood to help pay off debt. I make $600 to $1,000 a month with this project. My log splitter went down recently when a hydraulic line burst and the machine caught on fire. I'm not sure how much it will cost to get it going again. Should I invest in a new one that will increase my productivity and help me pay off debt faster?   Chris
 Dear Chris,   If I'm in your shoes, I'm going to fix the old one. Even if it means duct tape and glue, I'm going to try to find a way to repair it instead of spending a bunch of money or going deeper into debt.
 If you can't do that at a reasonable price out of pocket, I'd be in the market for a decent, used log splitter. And pay cash! I get your line of thinking when it comes to increasing productivity. Splitting wood is real work. But don't try to justify buying an expensive, new piece of equipment when it's just not necessary.
 If you're making that much with a side hustle, you can make your money back on a used splitter in a month or two - three at the most. Be smart about it, Chris!   Dave

De esto se sigue un elemento central que todavía no hemos mencionado: la cultura del victimismo supone que la condición de ser víctima o victimario no es circunstancial sino esencial. No se es víctima o victimario por algo que se haya padecido o se haya realizado sino que, a priori, en función de a qué identidad se pertenezca, se forma parte del bando de las víctimas o de los victimarios. Si usted ha nacido en una familia de buen pasar, es un varón blanco, heterosexual y occidental cumple con todas las condiciones para ser un victimario esencial. Sus privilegios pueden incluso determinarse a priori y este es un punto a tener en cuenta porque, como indica el propio Giglioli, dado que el concepto de “culpa” se ha secularizado para devenir “deuda”, el castigo que debe recibir el privilegiado/victimario esencial es una deuda eterna. Juega aquí también esta particular concepción por la cual la condición de víctima y victimario se transmite de generación en generación a tal punto que hoy alguien puede sentirse víctima de lo que padeció un ancestro de su comunidad 600 años atrás. Estos reclamos buscan, claro está, efectivizarse jurídicamente o en políticas públicas pero la idea de la existencia de victimarios esenciales con deudas, por definición, inextinguibles, permite comprender por qué muchas de las disputas de la actualidad se dan más en internet que en la justicia. Lo que sucede es que la justicia puede demostrar que una denuncia es falsa o aun cuando demostrara que la denuncia en cuestión es verdadera, impondría una pena proporcional al delito. Esto demostraría que todo individuo agresor no es un victimario esencial sino un victimario circunstancial que debe cumplir una pena que, aun cuando fuera extensa, tiene un límite en el tiempo. En cambio, cuando las acusaciones, denuncias, etc. se dan en redes sociales o se replican en portales, el señalado pierde su presunción de inocencia y automáticamente se le impone de hecho una pena que no tiene proporción. Es una pena eterna porque quedará en el mundo virtual por siempre como merece quien es considerado un victimario esencial. Si su ser es el de un victimario esencial, usted tiene una deuda impagable y le corresponde una pena eterna. Por eso hoy en muchos casos la lucha se da menos en sede judicial que en la edición de wikipedia.

Whereas the original series followed Smith's eponymous character on his mischief-filled journey to becoming the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, the developing show puts a dark spin on the lead's backstory. In _Bel-Air_ , that infamous scuffle mentioned in the theme song actually lands Will behind bars — police discover that he's illegally carrying a weapon with him and take him into custody — and his mother quickly ships him off to the Banks' family in Los Angeles to prevent him from serving jail sentence. Far away from the community he knows and loves, Will initially struggles to adjust to his new environment, but the love of his family and friends helps him find his place and his throne.
 Smith took notice of Cooper's trailer and was inspired about the retelling, so much so that he reached out to the young creative to talk about working together.
 "What's exciting to me is the new media of it all," Smith told Cooper in a reaction video shared on his YouTube channel. "Even for you to create a pitch video is in keeping with the idea of how the idea [for _Fresh Prince_ ] originally came to me."
 The pair will team up for _Bel-Air_ , and they will be joined by some of the OG show's team members. _THR_ reports that original series producers Quincy Jones and Benny Medina as well as creators Andy & Susan Borowitz will work alongside Smith as exec producers. Cooper will write the script with Chris Collins ( _The Wire, Crash, Sons of Anarchy_), who will also serve as its showrunner.
  _Bel-Air_ is still in its development stage, so there are no whispers about who could possibly take up Smith's star-making role in the reboot. But knowing that the Fresh Prince himself is onboard with the remake puts me at ease — there's no way it won't be good.

Boro were bottom of the table when the season was voided, despite numerous points deductions for the Cheshire club for failure to pay their players.
 They stayed there too after the EFL used points-per-game to decide the final table.
 But among the penalties levied against the Silkmen were four points originally suspended until next season.
 The panel decided that would be activated immediately, confirming Stevenage’s survival.
 A statement from the EFL said: “An independent arbitration panel has upheld the EFL’s appeal in respect of the outcome of an independent disciplinary commission who in June 2020 had considered misconduct charges brought against Macclesfield Town.
 “The charges related to failing to pay a number of players on the applicable payment dates due in March 2020, failing to act with utmost good faith in respect of matters with the EFL and for breaching an order, requirement, direction or instruction of the League.
 “The arbitration panel confirmed that the two-point suspended sporting sanction activated on 19 June 2020 from previous proceedings will stand and in addition the four point deduction, originally suspended in the latest proceedings and only to be activated in the event of a further breach of regulation 63.7 during season 2020-2021, will be activated immediately and applied to the 2019-2020 table.
 “Today’s outcome leaves Macclesfield Town in 24th position in the table on 19 points with a points per game (PPG) total of 23.62, resulting in the club’s relegation into the National League.
 “The arbitration panel’s decision is final and binding.
 “The EFL will be making no further comment.”

We're trying to do as best as we can regionally, but only about 4 or 5 percent of physicians are Latino, so ultimately we are underrepresented in medicine. If we could do it in a more deliberate way at the federal and state levels, we'd be more effective.

For decades, menstruation has been a barrier to women’s equality. The monthly menstruation cycle can cause a variety of painful symptoms that continue with each cycle until menopause, typically occurring between the ages of 45 and 55.
 Menstrual cycle symptoms can include pelvic and lower back pain, headaches, fatigue and mood swings caused by a fluctuation in hormonal levels. Period- related pain, also referred to as dysmenorrhea, is common worldwide. It often affects school and workplace performance, and can grow worse with age. Painful periods interfere with 20% of women’s daily activities, according to a 2012 study.
 In some parts of the world, women face discrimination, are forced to suffer menstrual pain in silence in the workplace or lose pay by staying home. In Nepal, girls are banished to “period huts” during their cycle because they are considered polluted, even toxic. The practice has had deadly consequences: In 2017, a teenager in western Nepal was bitten and killed by a poisonous snake.
 In India, viewing menstruation as taboo causes real harm, author Rose George notes in “The Taboo of Menstruation.” Women face discrimination and superstition, sanitary supplies remain unavailable or unaffordable, and access to safe and clean toilet facilities serve as barriers in managing menstrual hygiene.
 Countries have made strides in addressing the issues surrounding periods, such as tackling the “tampon tax.” The Scottish Parliament this year passed a bill to make pads and tampons free across the board. But Zomato’s policy is the latest move to try to dismantle wider outdated workplace policies. In Japan, for example, Yumi Ishikawa, a model, actress and temporary worker, gathered 18,000 signatures for a petition to end employer dress codes that force women to wear heels.
 Zomato isn’t the first Indian company to introduce period leave. The state of Bihar has had two extra days of casual leave for government employees to take time off for periods since 1992. In 2017, the digital media company Culture Machine, which has offices in five cities in India, put in place a menstrual leave policy independent of vacation and sick days. There are also forms of menstrual leave policies in Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Zambia.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden is on the cusp of announcing the biggest, and possibly most consequential, decision of his political career with the unveiling of his running mate.The staff is in place. There’s a communications rollout strategy ready to go. And organizers of the Democratic National Convention have a speaking slot scheduled, on Thursday night next week.All that’s missing is the name.Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday. The campaign has already been preparing, even as Biden himself spent some of the past week privately interviewing contenders in advance of his final decision.It will mark just the third time in history a woman has been chosen as a running mate on a major party presidential ticket, and could be the first time a Black woman is elevated to the role.Reporters descended on an otherwise quiet Wilmington on Tuesday, anxious to detect any hint that Biden had made up his mind. But they found only security personnel gathered outside his home, with no indication Biden himself was there.There didn’t appear to be a motorcade at the home that would have suggested Biden was there, though a small group of journalists staked out the area in cars parked on the other side of the road. Biden’s campaign won’t confirm its candidate’s exact location, but video images from recent days have shown him in Rehoboth Beach, where the Bidens own a vacation home, which is about 90 miles from his house in Wilmington.Another group of about a dozen reporters gathered around the different entrances of the stately Hotel duPont in downtown Wilmington. The venue could serve as a backdrop if Biden decided to organize an in-person announcement event, though valets and other staff members milling about the exterior said they didn’t have any details about an upcoming event involving Biden.Earlier Tuesday, the campaign announced a slate of nine staff members already assigned to the pick, including a number of longtime Biden and Barack Obama aides.Appointment of those aides is meant to help the running mate get started immediately after she’s announced, according to Mo Elleithee, a longtime Democratic operative who served as a spokesman on Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign.“It has become typical over the past few presidential campaign cycles for the presumptive nominee to put a team in place so that the running mate can hit the ground running, and so that it’s a more integrated campaign,” he said.And that immediate integration into the campaign becomes all the more important at a time when nearly all of the campaign has gone online.The unique nature of this year's campaign — set against the backdrop of a global pandemic, economic uncertainty and a reckoning over systemic racism — could add more weight to Biden's pick than those in recent history. She'll be called upon to speak credibly on issues of race and economic inequality, and she'll be evaluated on her ability to govern and lead during a particularly rocky phase in America's history.Liz Allen, who previously worked at consulting firm Glover Park Group, served as both Biden and Obama’s deputy communications director, and will fill the role of communications director for Biden’s running mate. Sheila Nix, who served as chief of staff to Biden during the 2012 campaign and subsequently filled the same role for second lady Jill Biden in the White House, will be a senior adviser.Karine Jean-Pierre, who held senior leadership roles on both the 2012 and 2008 Obama campaigns and worked as a regional political director in the White House during Obama’s first term, will serve as the running mate’s chief of staff. The full slate includes a policy director, political director and scheduling and advance staffers for both the running mate and her spouse, and a number of staffers who have been serving on the Biden campaign since 2019.Sen. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s vice-presidential pick in 2016, said that he and his wife did nearly 1,000 events, fundraisers and media interviews in the 105 days he was on the campaign. Kaine, describing himself as a “road warrior,” said he visited 140 cities in 40 states — but noted this year the running mate could be expected to do even more, from the comfort of her home.“The bad news is, it’s gonna be hard to go to 140 cities in 40 states. The good news is, I spent a lot of time in the air getting from one place to the next,” Kaine said. He estimated he did on average seven events a day during the campaign, but now that the vice-presidential pick can do them by zoom, they might be able to do 15 or 20.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
