 I am an exercise physiologist and sports medicine specialist who studies exercise-associated collapse. I am seeing and hearing of more incidents of skeletal muscle ruptures that are causing harm in other parts of the body.
 This information is not designed to scare people back onto the couch. The key take-away from highlighting these cases is to remind athletes, coaches and mere mortals that the desired physiological response to a training stimulus requires both a gradual buildup period and period of recovery in between training sessions.
 _More than muscle injury_
 The medical term for skeletal muscle cell rupture is "rhabdomyolysis," or "rhabdo" for short. When muscle cells rupture or explode, the intracellular contents are released into the bloodstream. These cellular contents include enzymes, such as creatine kinase; electrolytes, such as potassium; and proteins, such as myoglobin.
 Myoglobin, in particular, is a big, red protein that can block the kidney filtration system, or renal tubules, that serve as kidney plumbing. It also can dissociate into toxic byproducts that injure kidneys. In rare cases, too much myoglobin in the bloodstream can stop kidney function altogether, as happened with a 27-year old marathon runner who died from kidney failure.
 In a study we conducted on college swimmers, we saw a cluster of rhabdomyolysis, in which six out of 34 swimmers were hospitalized after participating in a 20-minute or so "arm competition" to see how many pull-ups, rows and bench presses they could complete. Cases of "symptomatic rhabdo," or those needing medical treatment, appear to be increasing within collegiate sports teams at an alarming rate, with the characteristic appearance seen in football players returning to January practice after a season-ending holiday layoff.
 To date, 17 cases of team rhabdo have occurred from doing "too much, too soon, too fast" and include a variety of sports such as football, swimming, lacrosse, soccer, track, basketball, softball, volleyball and golf.
 _Noncompetitive athletes affected too_
 So, what about us mere mortals trying to get back in shape? Any physical activity that is either new or excessive can cause symptomatic rhabdo. Excessive gardening, weightlifting, CrossFit type activities and even a routine Army physical fitness test have triggered symptomatic rhabdo with kidney injury.
 Over 90 cases of rhabdo have been documented after spinning, while 119 high school students in Taiwan ended up in the emergency room after their teacher made them complete 120 push-ups within five minutes. Thus, harmful muscle cell rupture can occur after any degree five minutes to 36 hours of exuberant and/or unaccustomed physical activity.

 In combination, gradual training and appropriate recovery allow beneficial muscular, cardiovascular and body composition adaptations to occur, such as building muscle, increasing fitness and losing body fat. Our research confirms that a two-week gradual introduction into training after a layoff is required for muscle cell membranes to fully adapt to training stress.
 Subclinical rhabdo, or muscle breakdown without acute kidney injury or debilitating symptoms, is common and represents the typical response to training which does not require medical treatment. However, hard exercise, especially following a layoff, with the following signs or symptoms within one to two days requires an appropriate medical examination:

Contract language, which remains subject to approval by the board of supervisors, calls for a base salary of $6 million plus various performance- related bonuses.
 "Coach O has set a new standard at LSU," athletic director Scott Woodward said. "He has proven that he is not only a championship coach, but also a leader of a program committed to doing things the right way. He has represented our institution and our state with great pride, on and off the field of play."
 Woodward added that the new contract "should make clear our commitment to Coach O and the direction of our football program."
 The 58-year-old Orgeron was the consensus 2019 national coach of the year.
 He has led LSU to a 40-9 mark since initially taking over on an interim basis in 2016. Of his 40 wins at LSU, 12 have come against teams ranked in the top 10 at the time of the matchup, including seven in 2019, which stands at the most in college football history for a single season.
 His 40 wins through the first 49 games of his career ties for the most by any coach in LSU history.
 Orgeron grew up in Larose, Louisiana, about 100 km southwest of New Orleans, and passionately followed LSU football as a child.
 "I'm happy to represent LSU and this great state," Orgeron said. "My family and I are very grateful, and I look forward to working as hard as possible to continue to win championships at LSU."
 Orgeron was an LSU assistant and recruiting coordinator when he took over as interim coach after Les Miles was fired four games into the 2016 season. He was retained on a permanent basis before LSU's bowl game that season.
 His promotion represented a lifelong dream for Louisiana native who won a state title as a player at South Lafourche High School and received a scholarship to play for LSU, only to drop out of school briefly before resuming his college playing career at Northwestern State.
 Following that, he embarked on a long, winding coaching career that included stops as an assistant at Syracuse, Miami, Tennessee and USC, as well as an unsuccessful stint as head coach at Mississippi. He also briefly serves as a defensive line coach for the New Orleans Saints.
 This past season, he oversaw the greatest season in the 126-year history of LSU football, spearheaded by a nation-leading offense that broke a slew school records. Joe Burrow became just the second Heisman Trophy winner in LSU, and the school's first quarterback to receive college football most prestigious individual award.

OFFICER SHOOTING-MAN CHARGEDMissouri man who was shot by police facing criminal chargesCLEVER, Mo. (AP) — A 48-year-old southwest Missouri man who was shot by police last week has been charged after authorities allege he pointed a gun at the officer who shot him. Cliff Meny was charged Thursday after a Jan. 18 confrontation with police in Clever. The Springfield News-Leader reports a probable cause statement says Meny called 911 that day and said he had a gun and needed help. The statement says Meny pointed a gun in a shooting position at Clever officer Logan High, who fired several shots. Meny remained hospitalized Friday. He was charged with first- degree assault, armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon.BC- CONVICTED MURDERER-SECOND VICTIMFormer Missouri police officer sentenced to second murderKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A former Grandview police officer already serving life in prison for a 2008 murder has pleaded guilty to committing a second killing two years later. Jeffrey Moreland pleaded guilty Friday in the October 2010 death of 75-year-old Nina Whitley in south Kansas City. He was sentenced to 20 years for second-degree murder and 10 years for armed criminal action. Moreland is already serving life without parole in the death of 30-year-old Cara Jo Roberts, who was killed in her Harrisonville home. DNA evidence connected Moreland to both murders.BAIL-MISSOURILawmakers slam Missouri Supreme Court over bail rulesCOLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Dozens of Missouri lawmakers are asking the state Supreme Court to undo new rules that limit when judges can impose bail. Republican Rep. Justin Hill says the new rules made it difficult for judges to set bail and have led to some dangerous criminals walking free as court proceedings play out. Judges can still set bail under the new rules. But they can only set bail at an amount necessary to ensure either public safety or that the defendant will appear in court. The changes are aimed at reducing court costs that can sometimes derail the lives of low- income defendants.MEDICAL MARIJUANA-DISPENSARY LICENSESMissouri grants licenses for medical marijuana dispensariesJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri health officials have posted the list of recipients of the first 192 licenses to operate medical marijuana dispensaries in the state. The move Friday brings Missouri closer to joining the many other states that already allow at least some form of marijuana use. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services awarded 24 dispensary facility licenses in each of Missouri's eight congressional districts. The state received nearly 1,200 applications. Voters made medical marijuana legal in 2018, but because the drug must be grown at approved sites and tested, sales aren't expected to begin until this summer.RENTAL COMPANY-HUNDREDS OF JOBSColumbia-based rental company to offer hundreds of new jobsCOLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — A high-tech rental company based in Columbia says it plans to hire hundreds of new employees by the end of the year. William Schlacks, a co-founder of EquipmentShare, announced Thursday about 800 of those new jobs will be in Missouri. EquipmentShare rents everything from small tools to earth-moving equipment. It uses technology such as key pads to operate the equipment and cameras to ensure productivity. Schlacks and his brother started the company in San Francisco but decided to move back to their native Missouri. Gov. Mike Parson attended the announcement Thursday in Columbia and said it was a “win-win” for the state.MISSOURI PRISONSMissouri prisons paring back as prison population dropsCOLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Missouri is planning to cut more than 1,700 beds at prisons across the state. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann says the agency is able to pare back because of a drop in the number of inmates. The number of prisoners has dropped from more than 33,000 in 2017 to about 26,000. Pojmann says the drop is due to a change in Missouri criminal laws. Judges now are sentencing more people to probation instead of prison time. Beds are being eliminated at the Algoa, Boonville, Tipton, Farmington, and Northeast correctional centers, as well as the Western Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center.ST.

Gardner was pulled over on Dec. 23 for driving after dark without her headlights on. She recently told an interviewer that she felt intimidated. She contacted one of her investigators who showed up and questioned why the officer stopped Gardner. A police memo says that after being told no ticket would be issued the investigator returned to his car. A police spokeswoman confirmed the internal investigation but declined further comment.AP-US-HEALTH-CARE-FRAUD-PHYSICIAN-INDICTEDMissouri doctor indicted in alleged fentanyl fraud schemeSPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) — A federal grand jury has indicted a 63-year-old southwest Missouri physician accused of receiving kickbacks from a pharmaceutical company for prescribing fentanyl spray. Prosecutors alleged Thursday that Randall Halley, of Nixa, became one of the top prescribers of fentanyl spray in the country while working at medical facilities in Nixa, Springfield, Marionville and Ozark. The indictment alleges Halley wrote more than 355 prescriptions for fentanyl spray from May 2013 to March 2019. In return, an Arizona-based company that produced the spray allegedly paid Halley $92,225 in kickbacks. Halley's attorney, Thomas Carver, says his client will fight the allegations. He says Halley never did anything to endanger other human beings.

Later, I talked with a birder friend, who informed me that robins from Labrador and other northern regions migrate south to the Green and White Mountains in winter, where they feed on mountain ash berries.
 Indeed, during our snowshoe trek to the pond, we had noticed clumps of bright red fruit in the small mountain ash trees, topped with powdery snow.
 Although the Northeast is not known for winter fruit, according to University of Vermont biology professor emeritus Bernd Heinrich in his book “Winter World, there are 29 species of berries which ripen in fall and persist on the branch through the winter.
 Trees and shrubs laden with refrigerated fruit are an important food source for wildlife, especially birds, and can produce some unusual sightings.
 The only time I’ve ever seen pine grosbeaks was on a cold winter day – the big, olive-green females and rose-colored males were feeding on crabapples in a small tree next to a health clinic. These birds live in Canada’s coniferous forests but visit our region in years when seeds and wild fruit are scarce there.
 Another time I witnessed a chattering flock of Bohemian waxwings descend on the staghorn sumac trees lining a parking lot in Montpelier to feed on the fuzzy, reddish fruits.
 Bohemian waxwings, named for their nomadic behavior, are larger than their more familiar cousins, the cedar waxwings, and more colorful, with white and yellow wing marks. Like pine gros-beaks, they reside in boreal forests, but flocks periodically invade the U.S., where they roam about in search of wild fruit.
 Bohemian and cedar waxwings are the most frugivorous – fruit-eating – birds in North America. Their stomachs have less musculature and their intestines are shorter than those of birds with a more varied diet. Food passes through the gut quickly, so they can feed rapidly when fruit is available.
 Flocks of waxwings can make short work of fruit on a tree. You might almost feel sorry for the plant. But plants and birds evolved together, and plants have designed fruit — delicious little pack-ages of pulp — to attract birds and other wildlife, in order to disperse their seeds. Many seeds can survive passage through an animal’s digestive tract and are transported to new places that way.
 Fruit pulp is typically rich in carbohydrates and vitamins and the seeds inside are concentrated sources of fat and proteins. However, specific nutritional content depends on the season of dispersal, writes Heinrich. Fruits with a long branch life such as staghorn sumac are more acidic and lower in fat, sugar, and water to prevent spoilage.
 Apples, both wild and cultivated, are another fruit popular with wildlife in winter. Check beneath an apple tree and you’re likely to find deer tracks, droppings, and pawings in the snow where the deer have dug up frozen fruit.

Holiday’s response was the kind of moment that showed precisely what the Pelicans’ veterans are trying to do for Zion. Guide him, offer advice and support without being overbearing.
 While JJ Redick scoffed at the notion of “protecting” Williamson from the avalanche of noise, he’s undoubtedly hoping to buffer some of the distractions that are flying at him at an almost unprecedented rate.
 “They handed out T-shirts like it was a playoff game,'' Pelicans teammate JJ Redick said of Williamson’s debut. “As his teammate, you just tell him you're in his corner. I told him before the game, 'You don't have to make the Hall of Fame tonight. Just go out and be you, and the rest will sort of take care of itself.’”
 It’s a mentorship Williamson said has allowed him to get through this unprecedented week in a bit smoother fashion.
 “(Holiday and Redick) been very helpful throughout this process,” Williamson said. “When JJ came and told me that, it definitely eased the tension a little bit. You could just feel the energy and what people were expecting. I just went out there and tried to make the right play.”
 And in Friday’s loss to the Denver Nuggets, Williamson looked even more natural than he did in his first NBA foray.
 He soared for a highlight block, launching a floater toward the fifth row. He feasted on mismatches in the post, making 7-of-9 field goal attempts thanks to the ability to lower his shoulder and use his immense size to gain separation.
 In all, Friday was a more repeatable performance than the debut supernova, when he made four straight 3-pointers. The Pelicans lost 113-106 to the Nuggets, but were 16 points better than them when Williamson was on the court.
 But, there’s still something missing. There’s still not normal.
 As Williamson slowly builds up his playing time, recovering from meniscus surgery, he’s missing most crucial parts of the game, sitting on the bench at the end of the fourth quarter and throwing the Pelicans’ rotations out of whack.
 It’s led to fans chanting “We Want Zion” as the final minutes bleed away in close home games.
