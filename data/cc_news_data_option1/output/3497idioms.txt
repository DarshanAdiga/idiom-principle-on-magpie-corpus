From the very beginning, Hawk strove to do more than just lend his name to the product. Both he and D’Amato, reminisced about Hawk attempting to teach Neversoft employees how to skate. Footage shown in Gur’s film, for which D’Amato served as a producer (and which is available to rent on most streaming services), indicates it didn’t go well.
 Yet Hawk, says D’Amato, was always available to the studio.
 “There were times where I could email Tony and ask him for a specific trick reference, and he would email me back a video or sometimes mail me a DVD,” says D’Amato. “He went out with his filmer, and actually took reference footage just for us and he shot at multiple angles. Each week toward the end of the project, we would send out builds of the game so he could play it and so he could give us an idea of what he thought about different tricks that we added. It was a load of great feedback.”
 And in a piece of now-familiar video game lore, just before the original game’s release Activision offered Hawk $500,000 as a buy-out on future royalties, which the athlete fortuitously declined. He wanted a say in the game’s evolution. And while Hawk was betting on the game’s success, it helped that his own popularity would skyrocket with the completion of the elusive 900 trick at the 1999 X Games.

While attempting to reconcile this, I wondered if the creators had fetishized the concept of Scandinavian Noir to such a degree that they thought at least one Swedish voice was needed for authenticity. But in fact, there are very few conventions of that genre otherwise on display. Since it’s filmed in Lithuania, we’re mostly dealing here with a sort of Baltic Gotham, forever shadowy, complete with blocky housing projects that retain something of the drab Soviet-era numbness from which they undoubtedly originate. There are no sweeping seaside vistas, no fjords, no fields of wheat, no barren snowy landscapes interrupted only by a lonely white birch. It’s just a grim city; nobody felt beholden to a Nordic vision. There are smaller confusions, too. If Kurt Wallander was an aging police inspector in the ‘90s, then a “young” Wallander would come of age in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Instead, they immediately chuck the prequel concept by staging the story in the present.

But the range of illustrations points to the fact that the Ramona stories themselves transcend generational divides. They have had such staying power because Cleary's writing, like all good writing, makes the universal specific and the specific universal. She mostly left out details that would freeze the story within a particular time period, but you can spot evidence of zeitgeist if you are looking for it. For example, second-wave feminism was rippling across the United States during the 1960s and 1970s and just so happened to coincide with Mrs. Quimby's choosing to work outside the home in _Ramona the Brave_ , published in 1975. In _Ramona and Her Father_ , published in 1977, Mr. Quimby loses his job and the family must "pinch and scrimp" to make ends meet, just like so many families did during and following the recession of the mid-1970s. It's not just big national affairs, however, that hint at the broader context; in _Ramona and Her Mother_ , Beezus is desperate for a haircut that looks like "that girl who ice skates on TV. You know, the one with the hair that sort of floats when she twirls around and then falls in place when she stops." She might be referring to Dorothy Hamill who, along with her famous wedge hairstyle, won gold at the 1976 Winter Olympics.

"articleBody": "
 The Canadian National Exhibition has had many odd traditions over the years that might seem peculiar in retrospect -- like the most beautiful baby contest. But there are some that still bring back good memories more than fifty years later.
 As the Star's resident photo archives 'expert,' I've often come across photos and headlines about the CNE that pique my interest and lead me down a path to learn more. Last year, my interest revovled around a photograph in the Star of a boy, lost at The Ex, from 1966. While searching for more details I learned he was just one of thousands that used to get lost at the CNE every year.
 This year, my research into CNE oddities led me to a photo from 1978 of two cousins, Darryl Boyle and Rob Robertson, then aged 14 and 12, camping inside a tent outside Princes' Gates. Both are seen flashing smiles and peace signs. Strewn about in front of them is a Sanyo cassette player, a pair of vintage Adidas sneakers and the board game "Pay Day" -- much needed for passing time.
 It was 16 days before the Ex was set to open, and they weren't the first nor the last to camp out for opening day.
 The tradition of camping outside the Ex started in the 1930s. In the August 24, 1934 edition of the Toronto Daily Star, two photographs show a group of boys sitting outside the gates after withstanding a downpour during their 48-hour wait.
 But it soon after the tradition came to a halt. The CNE was cancelled for the Second World War, when the site was transformed into a training and recruitment centre until 1946.
 Several decades later, as soldiers returned home and families blossomed during the Baby Boom, the camping outside The Ex would make a rebound in the 1960s with larger crowds forming for longer stays outside the entrance gates.
 A Star article from August 13, 1969 detailed the experiences of 14 kids who braved pelting rain. The first three kids in line waited the longest of the group -- about two weeks. Alexander Stewart, now 64, was one of them.
 "I wanted to go to Woodstock for the two days of peace and love, but as I was only 12-years-old my mother wouldn't let me go, so camping at the CNE was the compromise," joked Stewart.
 Stewart, his sister Adrienne and their friend Diane Larochelle were rewarded for their waiting efforts with Bulova wrist watches, free meal tickets and ride passes.
 Where did they bathe? Thankfully the public washrooms stayed open for the duration of their stay, Stewart answered.
 As the years went on, it got more competitive.
 "A lot of people thought we were nuts for going that early," Rob Robertson, now 54, said after arriving more than two weeks ahead of opening day with his cousin Darryl Boyle, now 56.
 Robertson remembers the police driving by regularly, every hour or two to check-in. Boyle said passersby would stop and chat with them as they tossed a baseball or listened to the Bay City Rollers on cassette tape. Some would even return with chips or other small tokens to cheer the boys on as they waited.
 "We didn't sleep much... I remember that," Boyle said. "We might have dozed off for an hour but not much more then that. We were just too excited."
 The two stayed outside the gates for more than two days until CNE officials decided to cut their camping trip short, officially declaring them first to arrive.
 With their early victory, the boys went home and made shirts in celebration of the Ex's 100-year anniversary that read, "Happy 100th Birthday C.N.E." which Boyle still has today.
 "I remember that I had a paper route at the time and I got to deliver the paper and it had my picture on the front page," Robertson says.
 Even more exciting? The boys met Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau who was at The Ex that year 100-year celebration.
 "At 14, I was just in shock." he says. "We were like little VIPs for the day. We lived it up, we really enjoyed ourselves. It was a very good day."
 They were interviewed by TV and radio reporters as soon as they arrived and given a free breakfast hosted by Shopsy's Deli. "I remember asking for an ice cream waffle for breakfast and they gave it to me," Boyle recalls.
 Dorothy Robertson, Rob's mother, said that the original Shopsy's location had a picture of the boys on the wall for many years until it closed.
 Even though Robertson and Boyle's outgrew their camping tradition, younger kids had taken over in the 1980s. Brothers, John and Paul Hamilton, photographed above, dominated the competition and won the title five years in a row.
 The camping out tradition saw its end by the late 1990s early 2000s when the CNE started the First Family Competition "to dissuade people from camping out overnight outside of our gates due to safety concerns," said Karen Lynch, Director of Marketing and Communications at the CNE.
 "Now with our advance ticket sales campaigns and tickets available online, this is no longer an issue," she added.
 Another difference? Most parents today wouldn't imagine leaving their children alone an hour, let alone several nights or weeks in the centre of downtown Toronto.
 "Back then it wasn't a big deal, not like today," says Boyle. "We never felt threatened."
 Today, when Boyle tries to explain the nostalgia of the Ex to his children, it's not quite the same. "They don't really understand because it wasn't as near and dear to them," he says
 With this years COVID-19 pandemic, The Ex has moved online to Boyle's disappointment. Having visited the CNE every year since childhood, he wanted to bring his two-year-old grandchild, Kingston, to the event for the his first time.
 From August 21 to September 7, 2020, you can access the CNE At Home online portal.

COVID-19 also claimed another popular event. Hamburg residents held last year's Popcorn Days celebration only a few months after floodwaters receded. Crain, however, says public health measures regarding large crowds made holding the celebration this year impractical.
 "We have all along tried to comply with state guidelines--and we're just unable to," said Crain. "We're just so sad. This has been going on since the '60's, and we did not want to interrupt it--even after a flood. But, for our citizens and visitors' health, our group, Kiwanis, has definitely decided not to participate."
 Crain adds one key element would have been missing from the Popcorn Days Parade this year.
 "One of the biggest reasons was to do a parade, you need bands," she said. "We had no bands to call, because no schools were in session. So, there couldn't possibly be a parade."
 Meanwhile, the post-flood rebuilding goes on. Over the past several months, Hamburg has secured around $18 million in state and federal grant money, plus approximately $150,000 in donations for 93 new projects. We'll have more on those projects in a future news story. You can hear the full interview with Cathy Crain on our "Morning Line" page at kmaland.com.
