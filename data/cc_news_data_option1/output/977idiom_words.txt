Council voted in June to close the Richmond Green Golf Course, which had seen declining attendance and financial losses between $150,000 and $200,000. Council also agreed in October to move to privatize the remaining five city-run golf courses.                                    Coun. Evan Woolley said he was caught off guard by Tuesday's discussion of redeveloping parts of the Shaganappi Point course, and the committee asked to take that off the table.                                    The committee opted to send bureaucrats back to look at a shorter time frame to test the market for interest from private companies to take over operations.                                    Nenshi said he thinks some council members have been swayed by what he described as "a tremendous amount of lobbying" from private golf course operators, but he's not sure there will be much of a market interested in managing the golf courses.                                    "Let's just see if there's anybody out there who wants to do this," he said. "My sense is there isn't. And I'd rather not spend $2 million and then put out a (request for proposals) that there's no response to."                                    The city's golf courses have been profitable in the past, but in 2013, they started needing tax support. The city is currently working on a strategy to improve operations to reach net zero operating support by 2022.                                    masmith@postmedia.com                                    Twitter: @meksmith
