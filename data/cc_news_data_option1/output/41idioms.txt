"Outside of the rain, we were very pleased with how the 2019 season went for our RUSH Sprint Cars," acknowledged RUSH Director Vicki Emig. "The rain put a damper on a lot of the events, but the car counts grew and the quality of racing really improved- a couple of the events were ones racers and fans won't forget. It was great to see five new winners. The growth of this division has even been on a faster pace than when our RUSH Sportsman Modifieds and Pro Mods started. We're excited for 2020, as this class continues to allow racers the opportunity to race a Sprint Car affordable and offer back strong championship point funds and contingencies."

The Nexon electric will be the second product from the stable of India’s largest auto maker to hit the roads this month. The indigenous company is taking the lead when it comes to electric mobility and the Nexon EV is a testimony to that. The SUV is powered by a 30.2 kWh lithium ion battery that churns out an impressive 129 PS and produces 245 Nm of instant torque from standstill. Tata says the Nexon EV can reach the speed of 109 Kmph from stationary in less than 10 seconds and its dust and water proof battery pack meets the strict IP67 standards. There are two drive modes on offer namely Drive and Sport and the car also gets Hill ascent and descent features. According to the company the EV can run for more than 300 Kms on a single charge and a fast DC charger can charge 80% of the battery in less than one hour. This new Nexon will come with an 8 year or 1,60,000 kms warranty and is expected to be priced between Rs 15 and 17 lakhs.

A rapidly growing healthcare distribution business is fast catching the attention of private equity players who have turned towards investing in medical distribution businesses. This will result in greater standardisation of practices and inflow of more expertise in the sector. Apart from entrance of more private equity players, a greater consolidation of businesses also seems to be on the cards. Globally, pharmaceutical and devices distribution have consolidated to a large extent. However, in India it is still largely fragmented. A series of acquisitions and mergers are already underway in the sector and the trend is likely to continue. As we move towards greater consolidation, this will also result in better supply chain management practices and improved technological prowess.

Much of the inside has been gutted, through the exposed brick walls and tin ceilings are being restored.
 The interior of 51 Main, formerly divided down the middle by a wall and bar, will be one large open ballroom for wedding ceremonies and receptions, said Greg Bugbee, co-owner of the new business with sons-in-law Dan Church and Casey Gold.
 An 8-foot opening is being cut into the wall separating that building from the former Memphis on Main next door at 55 E. Main, which will serve as the bar and cocktail area.
 The Venue CU owners are restoring some of the buildings’ original features, including the ornate blue-and-white-tile floor from Vriner’s Confectionary, which opened at 55 Main in 1898 and operated until 1997. During the building’s bar days, the floor was covered with wood and 12-inch-square beige tiles.
 Most of the soda shop’s original features are gone, but the owners will keep the wood and stained-glass soda fountain backdrop installed by Vriners in the 1930s, as well as some wood wainscoting on the walls, Church said.
 The exterior of 51 E. Main will be restored to the look of the original Varsity Theater, which opened there in 1906 as the first nickelodeon in the area. It began showing films with sound in the 1920s and was renamed the Rex Theater in 1943 after it was remodeled.
 “We’re trying to do it right,” Church said. “As we’ve gotten into this project, we’ve realized how much these spaces meant to the community over the years.”
 The buildings are owned by Dr. William Youngerman, who owns several other properties in the east end of downtown. Broker Alan Nudo is trying to get that area designated as the Downtown Champaign Historic District.
 Church said they did a structural analysis of the buildings before signing on, and engineers “found quite a bit that needed to be done.” Over the years, the support posts holding up the floor had started to rot, he said. Crews were digging new footings Friday.
 The bar backdrop is heavy, and “it’s actually starting to lean off the walls,” Church said.
 Vriners’ original tin ceiling had also been painted over. Experts were brought in to figure out how to restore it to the original silver to match the ceilings next door, Church said.

For many years, medical research has told us that expectant mothers who abuse drugs and/or alcohol, who smoke cigarettes, who are exposed to unacceptable levels of lead, who are poorly nourished, and who engage in other unhealthy activities, jeopardize the future health of their unborn child. However, the Harvard study found that the toxic stress an expectant mother experiences can also have a long-term impact on a child's well-being. According to studies, unborn babies are affected by the pressure pregnant women are feeling when they are struggling to make ends meet, when they are unsure where their next meal is coming from, when they don't have the resources to pay their bills, when they are unsure where they will lay their head at night, and when they feel unable to get out of the hole in which they are stuck.

“It’s such a mess,” he said.
 Prussing, who was elected in November 2018, is about a year into her four-year term.
 It’s time to pass the job onto someone else, she said Friday.
 “I haven’t had a vacation for a year, and I’m getting pretty tired,” she said.
 Still up in the air as of Friday was who will appoint Prussing’s replacement — county board Chairman Giraldo Rosales or county Executive Darlene Kloeppel.
 Prussing said Rosales will appoint her successor, but Kloeppel said she was researching who makes that appointment in a county with an elected executive.
 “The rule says that the presiding officer of the county board will make that appointment, and right now, that is me,” she said.
 Angela Patton, chief deputy in county Clerk Aaron Ammons’ office, said Prussing’s successor will be appointed by Rosales.
 Once official notice is given, the county Democratic Central Committee will make a recommendation to the board chairman, the board chairman will make the appointment and the full county board will vote on it, she said.
 Both parties will be eligible to slate a candidate to run in the Nov. 3 general election to fill out Prussing’s term, and those candidates would be slated after the March 17 primaries, Patton said.
 According to Rosales, the county board will officially declare the county treasurer vacancy at its next committee-of-the-whole meeting Jan. 14, and that will start the process for finding a new treasurer.
 “I am currently communicating with both county and party officials on how that process will occur. That position becomes vacant effective Feb. 1, 2020,” he said. “After the public announcement and notification to both political parties, I will have 60 days to finalize an appointment. This appointment will be made with the consent and approval of the Champaign County Board.”
 A former county auditor, former state representative and former three-term mayor of Urbana, Prussing said she ran for the treasurer’s office because she thought there should be a Democrat in that race in a strong election year for Democrats.
 “I didn’t want to do it for four years,” she said. “But we didn’t have anybody else to run. I thought I’d do it for a year.”
 Kloeppel said she knew Prussing ran for office because she wanted a Democrat in the race for treasurer, but if Prussing was going to serve for just a year, she was unaware of that.
 “I think she feels like she met her goal in that she wanted to get a Democrat in that spot, and she did,” Kloeppel said.
 Goss said he believes Prussing is retiring because she’s unable to clean up the mess in her office.
 “That’s a joke,” he said. “Why would you run for something and intend to serve for a year?”
 As of Friday, the last fund balance report for the county posted on the treasurer’s website was for September 2019.
 Kloeppel used some of the money in her own office’s budget to hire an outside accounting firm to help the county treasurer’s office get caught up on reconciling all 2019 monthly bank statements for the county. But Goss said the outside firm, CliftonLarsonAllen, was only able to get through bank accounts for December 2018 and January 2019 before the money ran out.
 What happens now is yet to be determined, he said.

There will be more than one electric SUV that will hit the roads this month. In a bold move iconic British car maker Morris garages will launch just their second car in the market and it will be an electric. The ZS is bigger in terms of dimensions when compared to cars like the Nexon EV and the Hyundai Kona. In terms of numbers to the SUV impresses even more. A 44.5 kWh liquid cooled battery makes 143 PS and 340 Nm. It races from 0-100 kmph in 8.5 seconds. The maximum range promised is 340 Kms but it really depends on which driving and regenerative braking modes you are using. MG says you can charge your ZS EV in 5 different ways one of which is through an AC fast charger that comes along with the car and will be installed by the company at a location of your choice free of cost. A 50 kW DC fast charger installed at the nearest MG dealership will charge 80% of the battery within 50 minutes.
