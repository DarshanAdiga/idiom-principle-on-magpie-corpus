As a story of a world-gutting flu pandemic, Stephen King’s “The Stand,” whose second, superior miniseries adaptation begins Thursday on CBS All Access, could not be more timely. And as a story of good and evil facing off for the usual high stakes — and of democracy versus autocracy, self-sacrifice versus narcissism — it also feels very on brand for 2020. Whether that makes people more or less inclined to watch, I couldn’t say.
 I have reviewed a lot of King adaptations over the years, and apart from “The Shining,” my King reading consists entirely of preparing to review TV adaptations of Stephen King novels. Sometimes they are better than the books and sometimes worse. First published in 1978, at 840 pages, “The Stand” was updated in 1990 with a few hundred pages more, and you will excuse me, I hope, if in this case I do not take the reading on. I have researched the novel — there is a deep well of information out there in the digital universe — and have read it in parts, but make no claims as to the relative merits of what appears on the page and on the screen. (Fans will have their opinions, I am sure, especially those who consider the book a masterpiece, while this is just a big, decent TV movie.) That a 2008 Harris poll named it America’s fifth favorite book “of all time” makes my picking up this heavy tome no more likely, given that the top ten 10 also included two novels by Dan Brown, along with “Gone With the Wind” and “Atlas Shrugged.”
 I will say that on its own terms it works well, and where it seems silliest it is following the map only as King drew it. (This is a book that includes a literal _deus ex machina_.) But even when it is silly, it is also fine. And it is never as silly — at least as seen from here — as the the oddly modest, nevertheless expensive 1994 ABC miniseries, with Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald and Rob Lowe, in which King himself played a small part — as did Sam Raimi, John Landis and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. (“A wildly tossed salad of mysticism slowly sinking in its own weird juices,” Times critic Howard Rosenberg called it upon release.)

The Model 3 Performance has two electric motors combining to the tune of 444bhp and a 0-62mph dash of just 3.4sec, and it responds to throttle inputs in a way that really challenges your fine motor control as well as your neck muscles. Electric range should be better in other 75kWh versions of the Model 3, however – the Performance version delivering a real-world range closer to 200 miles than 300 in our testing experience. Opt for a ‘Standard Range Plus’, meanwhile, and some of the range-topping model’s pace is sacrificed, but plenty is left over – real-world motorway range is around 200 miles. In the 'long range' version of the car, WLTP range rises to 360 miles.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A second COVID-19 vaccine is moving closer to joining the U.S. fight against the pandemic. A panel of independent experts is meeting Thursday to discuss the vaccine made by Moderna. The panel's review for the Food and Drug Administration is the next-to-last step before the agency decides whether the shots can be used on an emergency basis. The FDA staff issued a positive review earlier in the week, confirming the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the panel gives a thumbs-up, the FDA is expected to give the green light within hours or days. A Pfizer vaccine got the go-ahead last week.

That fact, and the subsequent announcement from the film’s studio, Warner Bros., that its entire 2021 slate of films would premiere the same way, has drummed up significant controversy. Some call it a betrayal of the exhibition industry, which has been hard hit by coronavirus shutdowns. Others label it a myopic move that shortchanges the talent involved in the projects in an effort to turbocharge the anemic launch of Netflix and Disney+ competitor HBO Max.
 But despite all the industry drama, nothing about what audiences will see in “Wonder Woman 1984,” which wrapped production in 2018, is any different than they would have seen this summer. For Gadot, who is in the midst of a flurry of press to promote the release, the important thing is not where audiences will catch up with Wonder Woman, but the fact that the film is coming out at all.
 “Before the pandemic, I would’ve flipped out and had a tantrum and fought super hard” for a traditional theatrical release, she says. “But in pandemic times, you just don’t know. I hope that, once the pandemic is over, all these wonderful big movies with great filmmakers and stars will go to theaters. I can’t see studios making tentpole movies just for the streamers because it’s a 360 experience to go to a theater and experience that. I certainly hope that, once the pandemic is over, things will go back on track.”
 Whether viewers are watching at home, at a drive-in or socially distanced at a theater, seeing Diana Prince back on track is sure to provide welcome escapism after a brutal year. “Wonder Woman 1984" reunites the heroine with her long lost love Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), mysteriously resurrected more than 70 years after his death. They face new villains Maxwell Lord (“The Mandalorian’s” Pedro Pascal) and the Cheetah (Kristen Wiig), and take on a crisis that threatens to plunge the entire world into chaos.
 Or maybe it’s not so escapist after all.

“It’s funny because we could’ve never anticipated when we shot the movie back in 2018 that it was going to be so relevant to now,” says Jenkins. “Of course we made the movie to be seen on the big screen — we shot on film for IMAX and had Hans Zimmer scoring the entire film. Of course this movie should be in theaters, and it will be. But the fact that it’s going to be on HBO Max domestically just means that more people are going to be able to watch it in America. And nowadays, I’m really in a place where I just want people to see what we did.”
 For Jenkins, Wonder Woman’s appeal remains her dedication to always doing the right thing. Even when it came time to think about a sequel, that wasn’t a quality she wanted to change. After all, 2017’s “Wonder Woman” quickly emerged as the critical and commercial jewel in DC’s current cinematic crown.
 “It’s so great that it’s Wonder Woman leading the way,” says Jenkins. “A lot of other great filmmakers have been messing around with other [heroes’ stories], and that’s awesome too, but I’m so happy for her success and for getting to [direct] it.
 “What I find interesting about her is that she and Superman are the OG, true north, very simple superheroes,” she adds. “They are people with superpowers [who are] here to save the day. All of the other superheroes that came after had some slant or angle that separated them. And so I think that was something that was strangely missing with so many superhero movies. None of them were very simple in that way. I loved getting to do that with her.”

The I-Pace will rapid charge at up to 100kW, but its slightly disappointing real-world range dents its potential as a long-distance tourer somewhat: 220 miles is a result worth celebrating - and moreover the I-Pace's slightly buggy charging software seems to trip it up more often than other EVs are when you're out and about, trying to get plugged in.

At Tuesday’s work session board members were in consensus that the hybrid model was the best option at this time, especially given the recent rise in COVID-19 cases both in Trousdale County and across Tennessee.
 On Tuesday, Trousdale had 76 active cases according to the state’s dashboard, almost three times what it had been a week before.
 “From the beginning, I asked the board to try to make a semester-by-semester decision,” Director of Schools Clint Satterfield said. “I think that’s even more important now because we are going into assessments. We need to build a schedule.”
 Under the current model, students go to school two days per week, either Monday-Thursday or Tuesday-Friday, and learn from home remotely the other three. Elementary and CDC students have had the option of going to school on Wednesday.
 Jason Sullivan, who at his first board meeting in September pushed to go back to full-time in-person classes, said even “my squeakiest wheels” among his constituents have accepted the changing circumstances and accept the need to stay on a hybrid.
 “I don’t even want to think about the possibility of not going (at all)… One person told me, ‘I’m acclimated now; I want it to stay this way.’ ”

“Wonder Woman 1984" marks the fourth film in which Gadot portrays the Themysciran goddess.
 “I feel like from one movie to the next I’m getting more and more close to the character and to understanding her DNA,” Gadot says. “It’s delightful for me to play this strong, powerful warrior fighter goddess. But when I go to set, I completely forget about all of those things, and I’m actually focusing on her vulnerabilities and heart and imperfections. That’s where I find the meat for the character.”
 The vulnerabilities this time around include her affection for Trevor — Gadot and co-star Pine effortlessly slip back into their winning chemistry, even when he’s sporting an ultra-’80s fanny pack — and an unexpected decline in her powers. No matter what challenges the character faces, Gadot says she always feels secure working with Jenkins. (The duo will re-team next year for a new take on historical epic “Cleopatra.”)
 “I’m very lucky that I got such an amazing partner who has such a clear, distinct vision about Wonder Woman and who she is,” says Gadot of the director. “And the fact that we are on the same page and see completely eye to eye and have the same intention for the character and how we want to make the audience feel. The first ‘Wonder Woman’ was the movie that I really feel was my breakout, and same for her. I feel like we were the underdogs that no one believed in. And then we did it together, and only we know how it felt. She’s a fantastic, smart, amazing woman to work with, and I’m very proud to call her my friend.”
 Originally introduced by director Zack Snyder in 2016’s “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” Gadot’s Wonder Woman will next be seen in Snyder’s cut of “Justice League,” which will be released as a four-part miniseries on HBO Max early next year. The director’s cut has been long anticipated by a vocal section of the DC fanbase. Gadot can’t spill any details — she has yet to see it — but acknowledges, “I’m very happy for Zack to have this opportunity of having his version of the movie out there.”
