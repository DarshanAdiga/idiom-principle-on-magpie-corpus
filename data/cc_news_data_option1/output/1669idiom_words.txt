On June 22, 2017, Google celebrated 117th birthday of the influential filmmaker and visual artist Oskar Fischinger by creating a doodle, to honour him for his work. Fischinger was known for creating abstract musical animation many decades before the appearance of computer graphics and music videos.

“In the world of design, Fischinger is a towering figure, especially in the areas of motion graphics and animation. He is best known for his ability to combine impeccably synchronized abstract visuals with musical accompaniment, each frame carefully drawn or photographed by hand. A master of motion and color, Fischinger spent months — sometimes years — planning and handcrafting his animations,” said Leon Hong, Google Doodles Creative Lead in a statement.
