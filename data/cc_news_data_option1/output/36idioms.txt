I think the best advice I can give you, first off, is that it shouldn’t be very hard to restore access to your iCloud account. Your “username” is either your email address or your phone number, and odds are good it’s your primary email address unless you’ve been bouncing around services for the past few years.

The Israeli prime minister was pushing on with what Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the ‘’peace of the brave,’’ based on the 1993 Oslo peace accords. Two years after the groundbreaking handshake on the White House lawn between the two men, Rabin was killed by an Israeli extremist opposed to peace negotiations with the Palestinians at a rally promoting the accords. Successive right-wing Israeli governments, which prolonged the occupation, and a weakened Palestinian leadership have overseen a process that was moribund and now effectively dead in the water after a series of moves by President Donald Trump have been widely perceived as favoring Israel and punishing the Palestinians.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Saturday called up 3,000 military reserve troops to combat the raging bushfire crisis which has so far claimed the lives of 23 people with high temperatures and strong winds threatening to worsen the conditions across the country.
 This is the first time that reservists have been called up in such a large number “in the living memory”, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said.
 Morrison said 23 deaths have been confirmed so far this summer, including the two in a blaze on a highway on Kangaroo Island in South Australia.
 The Prime Minister, after calling up 3,000 military reserve troops, said: “Today’s decision puts more boots on the ground, puts more planes in the sky, puts more ships at sea“.
 The ongoing bushfire crisis continues to worsen the deadly conditions in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
 More than 14,000 hectares have been destroyed in South Australia’s Flinders Chase National Park, Kangaroo Island.
 Media reports said that authorities were trying to get into 18 isolated communities in East Gippsland region.
 About 100,000 people were said to be in the fire zone of East Gippsland and according to police up to 70 per cent of people had now left the region.
 Evacuation orders were in place across Victoria’s Alpine region and navy was ferrying evacuees to relief centres.
 “We have seen wind gusts up to 67 km/h already today, up at Mount Hotham. It’s predicted when the change comes through we will see gusts up to 80 km/h. ‘We have a long way to go today. Today is a very challenging day for all of us,” Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said.
 Temperatures are expected to hit 40 degrees at Gippsland and 45 degrees in northeast. Fears of dry lightning storms are expected to cause more fires. About 50 fires continue to burn across Victoria with more than 820,000 hectares destroyed - mostly in the East Gippsland and northeast of the state.
 Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday declared the state of emergency, advising residents to leave immediately.
 A massive evacuation in New South Wales, dubbed as one of the biggest in Australia’s history, is currently underway with extreme fire conditions being predicted for six fire districts in the southeast.
 Severe conditions have been forecast for Sydney, the Hunter and the central ranges. More than 130 fires are burning across NSW including 40 in the state’s southeast.
 NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people to evacuate bushfire zones.
 “I’m pleased to say that we’ve never been as prepared as we are today for the onslaught we’re likely to face. All of the major road networks are still open, but we can’t guarantee that beyond the next few hours. So, there are still windows for people to get out,” she said.
 Over 3,000 firefighters are on the frontline, with 31 specialist strike teams in place across NSW.
 Australia’s military has been assisting with aerial reconnaissance, mapping, search and rescue, logistics and aerial support for months.
 A “tourist leave zone” was also declared for a 14,000-square-kilometre area between Nowra, South Coast region of New South Wales and the edge of Victoria’s northern border.
 Prime Minister Morrison has cancelled his planned first visit to India from January 13 due to the catastrophic bushfire crisis.

I am happy to support U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik because of her dedication when it comes to securing our border.
 Elise has my vote because she believes in common sense reforms to fix our immigration system.
 Elise wants to increase border security and promote legal immigration.
 Rep. Stefanik voted for $5.7 billion worth of funds to secure the Southern border.
 She has also voted against giving amnesty to illegal immigrants and voted to defund sanctuary cities.
 Sanctuary cities are dangerous to the American citizens who live in them.
 It is up to our elected officials to help the people.
 In June, Elise voted to provide humanitarian aid to the Southern border while also addressing security concerns.
 Recently, Elise signed a letter in opposition of New York state’s new Green Light Law.
 The Green Light Law grants driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants.
 This new law has already proven to have disastrous effects.
 Since coming into full effect, federal immigration officials have not been able to access New York’s driver’s license database.
 This is dangerous to New Yorkers and all Americans since it prevents us from fully vetting the people coming into our country.
 Elise understands that we cannot have people pouring into our country unchecked and undocumented.
 This poses a national security risk.
 Rep. Stefanik is for common sense security measures and is for legal immigration.
 She will have my vote in the future.

Comeback man Jasprit Bumrah will be cynosure of all eyes during India’s first T20 international against Sri Lanka in the year 2020 where its namesake global meet will gain precedence over everything for the ‘Men In Blue’
 Out for four months with a back stress fracture, the 26-year-old Bumrah is that precious diamond in this Indian set-up, which had been wrapped in cotton wool during the rehabilitation period.
 So much so that he was even exempted from playing domestic first-class cricket for Gujarat after intervention from BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, keeping in mind the workload he will have to take post international comeback.
 ## Indian team’s focus
 If 2019 was all about focussing on 50-over format, the current year will witness the Indian team playing close to 15 games before their T20 World Cup campaign starts against South Africa in Perth in October.
 There are slots to be locked and till Indian Premier League ends, a clearer picture is unlikely to emerge. But that won’t stop head coach Ravi Shastri and skipper Virat Kohli to set the ball rolling in this current series.
 It all starts here at the Barsapara Stadium on Sunday as the biggest city in Assam is slowly getting back to normalcy after protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).
 The Indian team would be checking out how the likes Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur react to pressure situations in death overs alongside Bumrah in the absence of frontline speedsters Mohammed Shami (rested), Deepak Chahar (stress fracture) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (sports hernia).
 Washington Sundar is still work in progress and he would like to put up performances that can ensure that only one among Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal can be picked in playing XI at any given point of time.
 Shivam Dube is a big hitter for sure but whether his seam up stuff can withstand the onslaught on docile tracks till Hardik Pandya is fully fit and back in action is yet to be seen.
 And that lingering question on Rishabh Pant’s consistency with Sanju Samson having already warmed the benches for six straight T20 games and the invisible presence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, making things a little unsettling.
 While Bumrah predictably grabs more eyeballs, the series is also important for Shikhar Dhawan, making a comeback into the team post knee injury.

Cardio exercise is great to burn fat so doing this you'll definitely see a change. However, once you end your cardio session the fat burning ends too. To continue burning fat after you've exercised you need to put in some sessions with weights. By building your muscle mass you naturally increase your metabolic rate so your body ticks over at a greater rate, burning calories faster.”

The lawmakers heard Thursday from economists, state officials and industry experts. They learned that while Idaho’s economy overall continues to grow, and state tax revenues so far this year are about $100 million ahead of last year at this point, Idaho wages continue to fall short of those in surrounding states and the nation. Also, while Idaho agriculture is on an upswing, the labor market is continuing to tighten, and housing costs are becoming an increasing burden for Idahoans.
 “I think it’s by and large good news,” said Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, who is co-chairing the joint committee. “Our economy’s been on fire for three years, so it’s natural that it would begin to slow down a little bit. I didn’t hear anything that’s cause for panic.”
 Legislative Budget Director Paul Headlee told the lawmakers that the state’s rainy-day reserve funds are healthy, with $486.6 million socked away between the Budget Stabilization Fund, the largest at $373.4 million; the Public Education Stabilization Fund, $62 million; the Idaho Millennium Fund, $39.8 million; and the Higher Education Stabilization Fund, $11.4 million.
 Among those providing information on Thursday was Craig Shaul, research supervisor for the Idaho Department of Labor, who said Idaho’s 2018 median wage, which was released in May of 2019, is $34,260, ranking 43rd in the nation. It’s the lowest of surrounding states, and is $820 below the next- lowest state, Montana.
 “A common refrain in discussions of Idaho’s comparative wages is how the state’s lower cost of living compared with the rest of the nation compensates for its lower wages,” Shaul said. “While Idaho’s cost of living is indeed lower than the national average, our adjusted 2018 median wage of $36,836 does not improve Idaho’s ranking. Instead for 2018, our adjusted median wage reduces our ranking to 45th.”
 Shaul noted that 2019 marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in Idaho’s labor market, with population, labor force, employment, jobs and wages all increasing over the past year. Idaho labor analysts expect Idaho’s unemployment rate, now just 2.9%, to edge up slightly in state fiscal year 2020 to 3.1% and to 3.5% for 2021.
 “This forecast is based on an expectation of continued gains in population, labor force, participation rates and job growth,” Shaul said. “Even as the expected averages are higher than the current one, the limited supply of labor still poses a challenge and potential constraint to the economy.”
 Health care jobs are expected to show the most growth over the next year, increasing by 5,200 jobs, Shaul reported; that’s followed by leisure and hospitality, with 3,700 additional jobs. Construction jobs are projected to grow by 2,100.
 “The acceleration in housing prices has been outpacing wage increases,” he noted. Rising rents also are becoming an increasing challenge for Idahoans.

If the high price tag for Apple hardware has kept you from buying a Mac but you're willing to roll up your sleeves and get adventurous, you can build your own "Hackintosh"--a PC that runs a patched version of OS X Leopard. _What?!_ , you say. Apple's move to Intel processors in 2006 meant that running OS X on non-Apple hardware is possible, and a community hacking project called OSx86 launched with that goal in mind. Since then, OSx86 has covered major ground, making it possible for civilians--like you and me!--to put together their own Hackintosh running Mac OS 10.5. Today, I'll show you how to build your own high end computer running Leopard from start to finish for under $800.

Before the break, the Wildcats played nine games and are sitting at just 2-7 on the season. But the good news is they haven’t played a Class 6A Area 6 game yet and they took the time off since Dec. 13 to make some much-needed adjustments.
 “We had nine games as reference points and what we did was make a lot of adjustments to those reference points,” Freeman said. “We cannot lose sight of what’s important and what’s most important is area games and taking care of home-court advantage. The majority of our games down the stretch are at home and we’re hoping to use that to build some positive momentum.”
 Freeman is most excited about the addition of some new pieces who will allow others to return to their natural positions and provide more scoring threats. In the new year, Benjamin Russell will see the return of senior Desmond Bishop and the addition of freshman Corey Millner and senior David Thames. Bishop and Millner will take over the point guard position, freeing up Za Stowes and Carl Russell to become the Nos. 2 and 3 guards, respectively.
 “(Point guard) is not their natural position and these two new guys here are more point-oriented than (Stowes and Russell) are,” Freeman said. “That definitely will help out a lot with the ball for us. Having addition to the teams at the guard position will also boost on scoring.”
 Offense seemed to be the biggest sticking point for the Wildcats in the first half of the season. They held all but three of their opponents to under 60 points but they averaged just 51.2 points per game on the offensive side.

 Seat belt usage can greatly increase someone’s chance of survival. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration thousands of lives could be saved annually if all passenger vehicle occupants older than 4 years used safety belts. Plus local first responders have told us that time and time again.
 Wear your seat belt — every trip, no matter how far you’re going and no matter what seat you’re sitting in. It’s a vital key to survival and highway safety.

El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador advirtió que “no se vale” que las entidades le “echen la culpa” al gobierno de la República de su situación económica y aseguren que elevan deudas o impuestos locales por un supuesto recorte de la Tesorería de la Federación.

Reforms proposed in the past would make financial bonds exceptions rather than the rule. They would also potentially expand judges’ discretion to keep potentially dangerous individuals behind bars without using money. But those against reforms want judges to have discretion to keep making bad decisions by imposing financial conditions on release.
 And unfortunately, perhaps because pretending to be “tough on crime” is still a politically viable strategy, it seems they will get to keep making those bad decisions for at least another year.
 But eventually, reformers will win.
 Judges will get to keep defaulting to financial bonds until enough people realize that “tough on crime” in today’s world really means “tough on your brother,” “tough on your mom,” “tough on your granddaughter” – tough on pretty much anyone unlucky enough to be poor and fall into addiction.
 At that point, reforms will pass, and pro-financial bail judges will change their tunes – or their next elections will be tough on them.

 He was also made subject to a two year restraining order and was told he must complete rehabilitation days for the attack.
 The 39-year-old breached the suspended sentence a month later when he attacked a homeless man after he refused to give him a sip of his Foster's lager.

Nakumatt creditors will on Tuesday vote to dissolve the once giant retailer after efforts to revive the supermarket failed.
 Peter Kahi, the court-appointed administrator of the troubled supermarket chain, says the creditors’ only meeting set for on January 7 will formally end the Nakumatt brands should the creditors support the liquidation plan.
 The creditors including banks, suppliers and landlords are owed Sh38 billion and the administrators will share about Sh422 million received from the sale of six Nakumatt branches to Naivas.
 “With the sale of assets to Naivas Ltd having been concluded, the administrator distributes and appropriates funds of the company to the various classes of creditors in line with IA 2015, after meeting costs of the administration,” said Mr Kahi of the Sh422 million.
 The six branches were expected to help the retail chain recover as it went back to the drawing board to correct the wrongs, pick up the pieces and bounce back having learnt from its mistakes. But, it appears, this dream cannot work.
 “An attempted turnaround of the business would be very costly and the company is likely to be loss-making for the better part of the turnaround window, implying that such a turnaround would need to be financed by additional debt to sustain operations before achieving breakeven,” says the notice.

“Our annual meeting is always a fun way to gather our members and the community at large to share the Friends’ accomplishments over the past year, our plans for the next year to come, and to acknowledge special volunteers who help make our organization so successful,” Austin said in a press release. “This year, we’re especially excited to have Dr. Gallo and to host the event at the Lebowsky to encourage a larger crowd. I can assure anyone in attendance that they will be treated to a truly memorable experience.”
 During his nearly 30-year career at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Gallo played an integral role in advancing human’s exploration of the world’s oceans, becoming one of the first scientists to use a combination of robots and submarines to explore the deep seafloor — recently co-leading an expedition to create the first comprehensive map of the RMS Titanic, which sank in the north Atlantic Ocean in 1912.
 Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Institute led the expeditions to find the Titanic’s resting place on the ocean floor.
 Gallo has also given several “TED Talks”, including one — “Underwater Astonishments” — that has gained more than 15 million views, and is ranked among the top 10 most popular TED presentations of all time.
 “Today, we’ve explored less than 8 percent of the world beneath the sea,” Gallo said in a press release. “Regardless of where we live, the oceans impact our everyday lives, providing humanity with half of the oxygen in the air and more than 90 percent of the fresh water we drink globally. I’m excited to be able to come to Owosso to share some of my experiences and to collaborate with the Friends organization as they work at a local level to help protect our precious water resources.”
 Austin said the annual meeting will serve two primary functions: To educate the public about the importance of water as a resource, and to inform area residents of the work the Friends organization is doing to maintain and improve the health of the Shiawassee River.
 “We’re hoping to get people who may not have heard much about the Friends to realize that, you know, we may not be able to do everything here, but we do have connections and we do get our information from a well-sourced scientific community,” Austin said. “Water is precious, whether it be our local river or the oceans, and the Shiawassee river shouldn’t be taken for granted because it’s a pretty great resource.”

President Uhuru Kenyatta has been asked to abandon his hands-off approach and take charge of Jubilee Party affairs this year.
 Some Jubilee MPs want him to work closely with DP William Ruto, instil order and respect party hierarchy.
 The MPs want him to come clean on mixed signals on party affairs and national politics being sent by his close aides and associates.
 Mr Kenyatta has also been facing a revolt from Jubilee MPs from his central Kenya region, which has escalated in the past one year.
 Bomet Central MP Ronald Tonui wondered why President Kenyatta had avoided convening the Jubilee Parliamentary Group meeting in the past two years, despite requests for the meeting to be held.
 “It is unfortunate that MPs have been reading from different scripts on party issues with the President failing to grant them a meeting to ventilate on the issues and take a common approach for the sake of party unity,” said Mr Tonui.

The new year is a great time for looking back and celebrating your competitive accomplishments, and it's also a great time for looking forward and planning where you'd like to go from here. But many of us have a locker full of failed resolutions. Would you like a little help keeping your resolution this year? Here are some tips to help you stay on track and go the distance.
 Pick a realistic goal and write it down
 Setting a realistic goal is the first and most important step. A common flaw of many resolutions is they're too ambitious. Take a minute to think about how realistic your goal is. If your goal's too tough, you've set yourself up for failure. If it's too easy, you'll lose interest. Consider seeking advice from a fitness or sports professional as to what goal is attainable and how to accomplish it.
 Once you decide on a goal, write it down and post it where you can see it. Be sure to word it gently. Goals like "do 30 pushups a day" or "hire a personal trainer" can seem more like a task, instead of something you want to do because you know it'll be good for you.
 Make a plan
 Once you've written your resolution, list steps you can follow week by week to help you achieve them. Making these steps enjoyable and rewarding yourself can provide the inspiration needed to maintain your hard work.
 Write these steps on your calendar, program them into your computer, and post them on your mirror or refrigerator so you won't overlook them.
 Expect the unexpected
 Surprises will distract you from your plan. It's a fact of life, but don't let them stop you from reaching your goal. When something takes you away from a step in your plan, immediately decide when you're going to reschedule it.
 Just do it
 Lots of people make excuses when it comes to following through with a resolution. Prepare yourself by considering what you'll have to sacrifice to reach your goal. Once you begin following through with your plan, you'll feel better about yourself, and this good feeling will help you reach your goal. In the end it all comes down to the familiar advice -- just do it!
 Need help?
 If you want help setting and managing your goal, or even meeting people with a similar goal, visit www.mygoals.com, an online service that offers tools such as pre-made goal plans, automated reminders, and expert advice. Here are some sample goals from www.mygoals.com to inspire you to:
 • Complete a triathlon

 • Ride my bike to work
 • Run every morning, rain or shine
 • Teach my toddler how to swim
 • Enroll my kids in swimming lessons
 • Join a walking club
 • Take a walk after dinner every night with my husband or wife
 • Take the stairs at work instead of the elevator
 • Join a gym
 • Learn to use free weights properly
 • Reduce my caffeine intake.
 Be sure to talk with your provider before starting an exercise program.

Regionali in Campania, una mossa del M5s rilancia i rumors sulla "grande coalizione" con il Pd, per superare il centrodestra. Un'opzione, tuttavia, per mettere fuori gioco Vincenzo De Luca, arruolando anche Luigi de Magistris. Il Blog delle stelle annuncia che da ieri, 3 gennaio, sono aperte le candidature alle regionarie per il candidato presidente di Liguria, Puglia e Toscana. La Campania non c'è, pur rientrando nella tornata elettorale di primavera. Ambienti pentastellati fanno notare come non sia un caso. Tra i grillini, da giorni, si parla di un'ipotesi di accordo con il Partito Democratico. Un patto che includerebbe anche DemA, il movimento di de Magistris. Un'intesa per mandare a casa Vincenzo De Luca, acerrimo rivale dei 5 stelle e del sindaco di Napoli, e scegliere un candidato unitario. Nel M5s campano ritengono assai vicina una convergenza. Candidato in pectore sarebbe il ministro dell'ambiente Sergio Costa, simbolo della lotta ai veleni in terra dei fuochi, da generale del corpo forestale. Il via all'operazione Campania sarebbe la nomina del rettore Gaetano Manfredi, di area Pd, al ministero per l'Università e la Ricerca. Deleghe, in precedenza, nella disponibilità del Movimento 5 stelle con Fioramonti. Tuttavia, l'accordo non sarebbe in discesa. Nel M5s ammettono che "De Luca sta andando avanti come un treno, ed è complicato per il Pd chiedergli ora di fare un passo indietro". Al tavolo dell'alleanza si studia lo scenario. Nella partita a risiko, potrebbero recitare un ruolo perfino le elezioni suppletive al Senato. Il 23 febbraio si vota a Napoli per sostituire lo scomparso Franco Ortolani, il geologo della battaglie anti rifiuti, eletto nei 5 stelle. Una data da non escludere a priori, come exit strategy per De Luca, da mettere sul piatto della rinuncia. Ma una destinazione improbabile, al momento. Il governatore uscente è già in campo per le regionali, da diverse settimane, giocando d'anticipo. Non ha ancora l'imprimatur del Pd, dettaglio singolare, per un presidente in carica. Ma non è neppure abituato a traccheggiare. Anzi, per sfidare i dubbiosi, prova ad aprire un "dialogo con tutti gli elettori, anche quelli Cinquestelle e del centrodestra". De Luca è candidato da De Luca, e si sente ringalluzzito dagli ultimi sondaggi. La rilevazione Winpoll per il Corriere del Mezzogiorno lo vede in vantaggio (39,5%) su Caldoro (36,7%) del centrodestra, altro player in attesa di un ok della coalizione. Ma lo stesso sondaggio colloca il M5s (26,2%) in testa fra le liste. Una lezione su cui al Nazareno riflettono. E fonti del Pd confermano: "Per un accordo i candidati di maggiore riferimento sono Manfredi e Costa". Anzi, la chiamata al Miur dell'ex rettore sarebbe un passaggio per "legittimarlo". Ma nelle stanze dem precisano che "De Luca è ancora in corsa, la trattativa con i grillini è alle schermaglie iniziali, nulla si decide prima del voto in Emilia". Le urne emiliane del 26 gennaio sono uno snodo cruciale, ed anche un test per la tenuta del governo. Nel Pd tifano, nemmeno di nascosto, per una débâcle dei 5 stelle, estesa pure alle regionali in Calabria. Negli auspici dem, il ko grillino archivierebbe l'opzione isolazionista. E sarebbe una spinta verso la grande coalizione. "De Luca pensa che alla fine non si riesca a fare - avverte un dirigente Pd di peso-, e si gioca la candidatura fino in fondo. E fa anche bene perché è un candidato forte in sé. Chiaro che se si trovasse la quadra su un candidato unitario, la partita in Campania sarebbe già vinta". Ma le subordinate restano ancora tante.

The one-off fight which is a must-watch this year, has to reside within the heavyweight division. Wilder versus Fury II starts the year with a moment to savour, but it is the match-up of the winner of that against Anthony Joshua to create an undisputed heavyweight champion which stands above everything else in the fight firmament. Should it be Wilder vs Joshua, it will be the battle of the big hitters. Should it be Joshua vs Fury, at Wembley Stadium, we will be witnessing one of the major single sporting events ever seen in this country. Tickets will be at a premium, and two boxers on a collision course for many years with deeply divided and different stories, will create a blockbuster event.

Back in a Dec. 7 column, I wrote that the only way the Buckeyes would lose a game this year would be if they beat themselves. And that's pretty much what happened -- too many turnovers, too many missed opportunities in the red zone, and too many penalties at inopportune times. A sloppy field that seemed to hurt Ohio State more than Clemson and a couple dinged up players in key positions didn't help either.

How much of the sky can you see at any one time? This, of course, assumes you are looking up from a wide-open, flat field or out on an ocean liner with nothing but a flat horizon no matter which way you look.      The entire sky includes every direction you can look from any point on the Earth's globe. The total sky is referred to by astronomers as the celestial sphere. Thousands of years ago, the assumption was that the stars were points of light on a great overhead dome, seen from inside. It does look that way.      One may think the amount of this inverted sphere that you could see from a flat field is one half. That's only true if you are positioned at the very north or south pole, or from the equator.      From the poles, however, all you ever see is the same half of the celestial sphere. From the equator, as the year goes along, you can see the entire celestial sphere, but only one half at any one time.      The Earth's equator is directly under its counterpart on the celestial sphere, the celestial equator. The north and south poles, which mark the axis of the turning Earth, points directly to the north celestial pole (NCP) and south celestial pole, respectively. (The North Star is very close to the NCP.)      If you have an opportunity to travel a few hundred miles north or south, you can easily notice how the sky changes. I've made a few trips to Florida, and have always been fascinated to see how far down in the sky the North Star appears, as compared to my view in Pennsylvania.      The measure of the North Star above the northern horizon in degrees gives you your approximate latitude. From home, my latitude is almost 41 degrees 30 minutes. From mid-Florida, where we have relatives, the latitude is just shy of 27 degrees. The entire sky shifts approximately 14.5 degrees every time I travel to Florida.      The whole celestial sphere is measured in degrees. All the way around the entire sky is 360 degrees, a complete circle. The NCP is at (+) 90 degrees; the celestial equator is at 0 degrees. Latitude has its counterpart on the celestial sphere; it is referred to as "declination." Longitude on the sky is referred to as "right ascension."      From where I live, I cannot see any stars below 48 degrees south of the celestial equator.      There is an entire portion of the starry heavens awaiting me, from (-) 48 degrees to the south celestial pole (SCP) which is at (-)180 degrees.      It's an incredible experience if you are familiar with the constellations, to see how they shift. The farther south I travel, the more stars are visible in the far south, which never break the horizon from home.      From Florida around Christmas time, in early evening, I am fascinated at the fact that the Big Dipper partly dips below the northern horizon, which never happens in Pennsylvania. The marvelous constellation Orion is rising in the east, but from Florida what an odd angle it makes!      FYI: The celestial equator, by the way, passes right through Orion's three- star "belt." From the ice at the north pole, during the 24-hours of night, you would see the top of Orion slowly moving around the horizon as the Earth spins.      From Florida on an early winter evening, I am amazed to see in the far southern sky the beautiful, bright star Canopus, far below Orion's stars and the bright star Sirius. Canopus is invisible from Pennsylvania. At certain times from Florida, I have glimpsed the bright star Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to the sun. Alpha Centauri is very low in the southern sky from mid-Florida; it is better to travel even farther south to see it.      A whole new sky unfolds the more you head south. Perhaps you have had a chance to see the stars from the Southern Hemisphere; I have not had that chance. You can trace the Southern Cross and many more constellations never seen far north. Constellations you are familiar with seeing are upside down when viewed from below the equator. The moon even flips on its head!      Traveling north and south, you witness that the Earth is indeed round like a ball, and you can better appreciate the vast wonder of the stars all the way around.      Full moon is on Jan. 10.

Some high school basketball teams like to get in a few extra games during the winter break. Whether by hosting a couple home games like Horseshoe Bend did just before Christmas or playing in a tournament like Reeltown, Benjamin Russell girls and Central Coosa did, getting in some extra playing time can work wonders for teams heading into the second half of the season.
 But for Benjamin Russell’s boys team, it was practice time the doctor ordered.
 “I don’t think games were what we needed since it is a new system and the guys being with me for such a short period,” BRHS boys coach Jeremy Freeman said. “This happened so fast for us; the guys never had a chance to stop and really evaluate what we were doing. A lot of times games are better than practice, but in this instance, it was better to have more practice time.”

BRISBANE, Australia — Nick Kyrgios served 20 aces in a win that cost him $4,000 in local currency and helped set up Australia’s opening ATP Cup win over Germany.
 It was all for a cause. Kyrgios, so often considered the bad boy of tennis for his emotional behavior and outbursts, promised to donate 200 Australian dollars ($140) for every ace he serves this month to go toward the recovery effort from the wildfires that have devastated parts of Australia, leaving at least 19 people dead and 1,400 homes destroyed.
 He opened and closed his 6-4, 7-6 (4) win over Jan-Lennard Struff on Friday in Brisbane with booming, high-value serves — including a second-service ace down the middle to close it out.
 Alex De Minaur followed that up with an upset over No. 7-ranked Alexander Zverev, trailing a set and a break before rallying to win 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2 on Pat Rafter Arena. Australia also won the doubles to clinch a 3-0 sweep of Germany.
 Kyrgios devised the cash for aces idea earlier in the week, and he inspired other fundraising efforts from other players and from organizers of the ATP Cup and the Australian Open.
 He said he was lifted by the crowd and motivated by the plight of people struggling in parts of the country affected by the fires. A tournament had to be relocated earlier Friday because of poor air quality related to the proximity of the fires.

HORNELL -- John P. Allison walked into the Hornell City Hall Thursday with a spring in his step and a get up and go attitude that comes with a new year, a new job and being newly recovered from a stomach bug that sidelined him during the final days of 2019, delaying his swearing-in ceremony.
   
 Allison, who was elected Nov. 5 to a two-year term as a Hornell Common Council alderman representing the 3rd Ward, was sworn into office by City Court Judge David Coddington. A Maple Street resident, Allison is a Hornell native who graduated from Hornell High School in 1994.
   
 "Oh, I feel great now," said Allison, 43, a union electrician and owner of the Park Drive Car Wash. Allison succeeds veteran Republican Alderman Joseph McKay, who did not seek reelection.
   
 Allison missed a swearing in ceremony on Monday due to the stomach ailment that had swept thru most of the family, which includes his wife, Morgan, a Hornell High School social studies teacher, and their children, Henry and Bess, both age 6, and Marty, age 2.
   
 The entire family was present as Allison took the oath of office while his children held a Bible. John Allison's parents, James and Mary, Morgan Allison and Mayor John Buckley looked on.
   
 Allison said he is ready to get started on his Common Council duties.
   
 A Democrat, Allison defeated Molly Liberto (Republican, Conservative, Independence parties) to earn the two-year term. Allison's committee assignments are Youth and Recreation, Planning and Development and Quality of Life.
   
 "We are very excited to have John join the team and represent the residents of the 3rd Ward," said Buckley, who represented the 9th Ward prior to his election as mayor. "I take a little personal satisfaction just knowing John here is (originally) from the 9th Ward and a product of good parents. The same thing as (new 7th Ward Alderman) Kevin Valentine, who also grew up in the 9th Ward. So we have some newly elected officials, all from our own neighborhood. Good kids growing up in a good neighborhood.
   
 "John, I'm very excited to work with you this year, and the coming years, and I know you are going to do a great job."
