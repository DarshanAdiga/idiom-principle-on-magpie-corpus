GRANGEVILLE — Idaho County investigators identified a 47-year old Elk City man who died by suicide in October as the likely killer of LeAnna Maree Bailey, 58.
 Investigators linked Billy Jack Jones to the murder using DNA evidence obtained through blood smears and material under Bailey’s fingernails obtained during an autopsy, according to a Wednesday news release.
 “At this point, investigators believe probable cause exists that Billy Jack Jones killed LeAnna Maree Bailey and if he were living, investigators would be arresting him for the crime,” the news release said.
 Jones, however, shot himself in the head Oct. 8 after investigators talked to him and scheduled him for a polygraph examination.
 Bailey had been living since about May at her brother’s property at 701 Wild Rose Lane in Elk City. She was at the property to clean up and prepare the property for sale following the death of her father.
 On Sept. 14, the news release said, Bailey had dinner with Sabrina Chambers at the property. Chambers left about 8 p.m. and was the last to see Bailey alive. She and Bailey had agreed to meet the following day, and the two gave each other a hug before departing.
 As Chambers drove off Wild Rose Lane onto Mother Lode Road, she met Jones driving a Ford pickup truck and flashing his lights to get her attention. Chambers and Jones had been in a long-term relationship that had recently ended.
 Jones seemed excited, according to the news release, and his arms were covered in scratches. He explained to Chambers that he had been picking mushrooms in the dark on the hillside across from Wild Rose Lane. At a later date Jones admitted to Chambers that he had been secretly watching her and Bailey, and he believed Bailey was the cause of his breakup with Chambers.
 Previously Bailey and Jones had met on Main Street in Elk City and gotten into an argument. Bailey allegedly had caught Jones stealing items from her brother’s property while he and Chambers were hired to help clean up.
 Jones reportedly was upset that his altercation with Bailey had been witnessed by local residents. Jones later told investigators that “you don’t do that to someone in a small town.”
 On Sept. 15, Bailey failed to show up for her meeting with Chambers. Chambers drove to the Wild Rose Lane property and found broken tinted glass in the driveway, and Bailey’s car was gone. She contacted Bailey’s brother, and after a few days the brother reported his sister as a missing person.
 On Sept. 18 a hunter found Bailey’s car over an embankment about 3 miles from the Wild Rose Lane property and notified the Idaho County Sheriff’s Office. Bailey’s body was found in the back of the vehicle.
 Investigators believe Bailey was killed while sleeping in her car at the Wild Rose Lane property. The rear seat of the vehicle had been folded down and was converted to a sleeping area with blankets and mats. Investigators said it appeared the assailant broke out the driver’s side rear window of the vehicle and attacked her from that doorway. Bailey was severely beaten, with bruising on her hands, arms, shoulders, face and head. Her nose was broken, and she had a skull fracture. She also had been strangled and shot three times with a .22 caliber weapon. Any of these injuries could have caused her death, the news release said.
 Investigators found blood smears on paperwork in the closed glove compartment and front passenger door pockets. They suspect the killer searched through the door pockets and glove compartment searching or looking for something. One of those blood smears was swabbed for DNA analysis.
 About Sept. 15 Chambers noticed a significant scratch on Jones’ right upper lip. He was interviewed several times but denied killing Bailey. Jones arrived for a scheduled polygraph examination, but the examiner canceled it before starting because his heart rate was elevated and erratic. Investigators questioned him about the use of methamphetamines, but he denied using drugs other than occasional marijuana. Jones agreed to see a doctor about his heart irregularities and meet investigators the following week for a polygraph examination.
 After that interview, Jones met with Chambers and she made it clear their relationship was ended. At some point, she told Jones: “I’m having a hard time believing someone I shared my bed with for 13 years is capable of killing someone.” Jones began crying and walked away without a denial.
 Chambers and other citizens in the area told investigators that, following Bailey’s murder, Jones no longer carried a duffle bag on the front of his all- terrain vehicle, which had contained extra clothes, survival items and a short metal-handled Estwing axe.
 When investigators were called to Jones’ home on Oct. 8, they found he had killed his two dogs, shot a propane tank in the upstairs area of his home that failed to explode or ignite then shot himself in the head with a .44 Ruger carbine rifle. In the area of Jones’ body, investigators found methamphetamine, marijuana and paraphernalia. Three empty .22 cartridges also were found on a table.
 The DNA forensic report was received Wednesday from the Idaho State Police forensic lab in Boise. A mixture of DNA from Bailey and Jones was found in the blood smear on the front passenger door pocket. Fingernail clippings gathered at Bailey’s autopsy were analyzed and another mixture of her and Jones’ DNA was found.
 “Although investigators consider this a senseless tragedy,” the news release ends, “LeAnna’s fortitude and fight with her killer provided critical evidence in identifying her assailant. LeAnna truly had the last word.”

Joyce Mortensen Huffman, a Moscow native, passed away Saturday, Oct. 21, 2020. Joyce was born Jan. 14, 1926, at Moscow, along with her twin sister Jeane, to Harry and Alma Willis Mortensen. She lived in Craigmont until she was 10 years old and then returned to Moscow with her family. Joyce graduated from Moscow High School in 1944. After completing high school, she worked at Snell Tractor (later Moscow Implement) while she attended the University of Idaho, graduating in 1949 with a degree in business.
 Joyce married Donald L. Huffman March 3, 1951, at the First Presbyterian Church in Moscow. The couple made their home in Seattle, later moving to Spokane and finally back to Moscow. Joyce and Don had three sons, Scott, Toby and Kip.
 Joyce had a successful professional career working as a bookkeeper at Puregro Company until her retirement in 1990. She enjoyed working at Puregro and often commented she knew all the farmers between Spokane and Genesee.
 Joyce loved sports and referred to herself as a “sportaholic.” She was a lifelong Vandal fan, attending football, basketball and volleyball games as well as a fan of the Seattle Seahawks and Mariners. She bowled on several leagues and was an avid golfer. She enjoyed playing bridge with her friends and attending sporting events to watch her great-grandchildren.
 She is survived by sons Scott (Debbie), Palouse; Toby, Genesee; and Kip (Jill), Viola; four grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her husband, Don; a brother, Bob Mortensen, Moscow; and her twin sister Jeane McNeilly, Colfax.
 Joyce was a wonderful mother, mother-in-law, grandmother, great-grandmother and friend. She will be greatly missed by her family and friends.
 Cremation has taken place and a private graveside service will be held at a later time.
 A special thanks to Kindred Hospice and the staff at the Regency Pullman who provided support for Joyce.
 Arrangements were entrusted to Short's Funeral Chapel, Moscow, and online condolences may be sent to www.shortsfuneralchapel.com.

MOSES LAKE — Even in the midst of a pandemic, Thanksgiving 2020 is approaching, and some people need a little help getting a Thanksgiving dinner.
 That help could come from the Moses Lake Food Bank, which is giving away Thanksgiving baskets from 11 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. today at 1075 West Marina Drive.
 Traditionally, food bank officials distribute Thanksgiving baskets the three days before Thanksgiving.
 Monday was drive-through distribution, and food bank director Peny Archer said 540 households took advantage of the drive-through this year.
 “Which is about average for the first day,” Archer said.
 Tuesday and Wednesday were for walk-in distributions.
 The COVID-19 outbreak has made some people reluctant to come inside the food bank building, due to the possibility of infection, Archer said.
 “Our volunteer help was lower. Which I’m also attributing to COVID,” she said.
 The food is prepackaged to reduce the amount of time spent in the building.
 Donations to the food bank increase during the holiday season, but the coronavirus pandemic has affected that too. Still, employees from Samaritan Healthcare, Confluence Health and Moses Lake Community Health found a way to hold their annual food drive.
 The three have partnered on the Thanksgiving food drive for about five years. The original plan was to solicit donations at a couple of local businesses, but the surge in coronavirus cases required a last-minute change of plans. Confluence and MLCH put donation boxes in the lobby of their buildings, while Samaritan employees collected donations in the hospital parking lot.
 “They did a wonderful job,” Archer said. “To have to go to Plan B, or Plan C, in a short time, they did fantastic.”
 With Christmas dead ahead, Archer said the food bank needs to restock its shelves.
 “We’re running a lot of food right now,” she said.
 Traditionally the food bank also does a Christmas toy drive, Operation Friendship, still on for 2020. Santa hands out candy canes to kids on the distribution day, but Santa’s visit has been canceled for 2020, Archer said. However, toy donations are still being accepted and parents will be able to pick up toys for their children.

"Ho vari ricordi di Diego sia in Italia che in campo internazionale con la Nazionale. E' un ricordo piacevole da un punto di vista calcistico ma spiacevole perche non avrei mai voluto sentire questa notizia. Ricordiamo Diego per averlo ammirato come avversario ma anche come compagno perche ci ho giocato insieme. Tutti coloro che hanno giocato con lui si ricordano di lui perche era un compagno e un trascinatore, un giocatore buono, che dava tutto in campo e dava tutto ai propri compagni. Credo che sia un fatto negativo per il calcio e soprattutto per chi ha vissuto con lui momenti belli. Per i tifosi del Napoli ma anche dell'Argentina e per tutti i tifosi del mondo perche lui rimane sicuramente il giocatore piu forte che ho visto in campo.

The Class 11AA All-State football team was released by the South Dakota Football Coaches Association at midnight on Wednesday. The state champion Pierre T.F. Riggs Governors had seven members named to the All-State team, with one of those seven being an honorable mention.
 Leading the way for the Govs was senior Maguire Raske. Raske had 1560 rushing yards on 245 carries and 25 rushing touchdowns. He also had 37 catches for 501 yards and four receiving touchdowns. For his efforts, Raske was named the Class 11AA All-American player of the year by the coaches.
 “I can't say enough about Maguire,” Govs coach Steve Steele said. “He's been an absolute workhorse this year. His previous few years, we were able to spread the load with other players, but everyone this year knows he's our guy. He is one of the best to ever play in Pierre, and he was a major reason that his class has played in four state championship games.”
 The youngest of the seven players is sophomore quarterback Lincoln Kienholz. He completed 116 of 209 passing attempts, and he threw for 2012 yards and 17 touchdowns. Kienholz also had 657 rushing yards on 92 carries, with three more touchdowns on the ground. Kienholz was named the Joe Robbie MVP of the State Championship game against Brookings after throwing three touchdown passes and running for another score.
 “Lincoln had some very big shoes to fill stepping into the quarterback position,” Steele said. “He has done a tremendous job of taking his raw ability and progressing all season into a very polished and confident QB. Without his growth, dedication, and will to compete, we are not back in the Dome this year.”
 Senior Regan Bollweg was nominated for All-State in the tight end position. He had 29 catches for 610 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns. He also set the career receiving touchdown record in just two seasons for the Govs.
 “Regan is probably the best all-around tight end in Pierre history, and he will continue to be a great tight end at the Division 1 college level,” Steele said. “He has put up very consistent numbers this year with everyone knowing he's our top receiving threat. Regan has really developed his blocking ability this year as well. He also does an outstanding job for us at our defensive end position. He does a great job setting the edge, rushing the passer, and even covering when needed. He is a physical force for us and a great team leader.
 On the offensive line, senior Gunnar Gehring was recognized. He blocked for a Govs offense that had over 4,400 total yards this season. Defensively, Gehring had 69 tackles, including 15 tackles for loss, two sacks and a fumble recovery touchdown.
 “Gunnar has been a staple of our line for the past four years,” Steele said. “Gunnar is among only a handful of Governors ever to start a game as a freshman. He has been an integral part of our defense the past four years.”
 Defensively, senior lineman Preston Taylor had 39 tackles, including nine tackles for loss, and two fumble recoveries. He was named the Outstanding Lineman for the State Championship Game after getting three sacks against the Brookings Bobcats.
 “Preston is our nose guard, playing a crucial role in our three front system,” Steele said. “He's a two gap player who is a major part of our solid run defense.”
 Senior defensive back Cord Ellis was also named to the All-State team. He had 53 tackles, four interceptions and two blocked field goals, including a blocked PAT attempt in the State Championship Game.
 “Cord has had an amazing season, stepping into the safety role and taking command of our secondary,” Steele said. “He's intelligent, and is able to read and put those in front of him in the correct position. He does a great job getting the defense on the same page.”
 Senior lineman Houston Lunde was nominated as an Honorable Mention player on the All-State team. He is the center for the Govs offensive line that helped gain over 4000 yards.
 “Houston is the most selfless person I have ever coached,” Steele said. “He will be our Burlsworth Character winner this year. Houston is our center, and he has done a great job getting the line calls organized. Houston is cerebral in diagnosing fronts and blitzes. He is also an amazing kid who on our week off due to COVID brought garbage bags all around the practice fields and school parking lot to clean up. He made our team and school better even when we weren't allowed to practice.”
 The Class 11AA All-State team was led by Brookings, who had ten players on the team. The Govs and Yankton Bucks each had seven players, while the Sturgis Brown Scoopers and Huron Tigers had five players each.

A range of five attractively designed Christmas cards are now on sale locally and will raise funds for the work of Mary's Meals Offaly.   The initiative is the brainchild of Ann McCormack and Paul Galvin, two stalwarts of Mary's Meals, and all proceeds will go towards the life saving work of the charity.   Ann enrolled the help of her daughter Siobhan, an accomplished artist, her sister Mary and local photographer, Paul Moore to help in the design of the cards.   Another friend, the best selling author, Geraldine O'Neill, also came on board and wrote seasonal verses for the cards.   Geraldine's latest book, “The Nightingale in Mersey Square” has just been released.   The pack of five cards, which sell for €10, are availabel from Tyrrell's shop, O'Moore St, Tullamore, O'Sullivan's Centra, Kilcormac or directly from Ann McCormack at (086 ) 1205514.   Mary’s Meals is a no-frills charity with a simple idea that really works: by providing one good meal in a place of learning, children are drawn into the classroom where they can receive an education that could one day free them from poverty.   Mary’s Meals works with local volunteers in some of the world’s poorest communities. The charity sets up the cooking and feeding facilities at the sponsored school, provides the food and the communities cook and serve the meals.
