Siamo alla ricerca di continuità di prestazioni. Quelle stesse che abbiamo già sfoderato nelle ultime settimane a partire dalla vittoria di Cava. Dobbiamo cercare di continuare a muovere la classifica, consapevoli che giochiamo su un campo non facile e che ci troveremo di fronte un avversario costruito per un campionato da vertice Il Palermo è costruito per il vertice. Ha calciatori di categoria superiore, nonché un allenatore esperto e vincente. Ha dei grandi valori. E’ vero che ha alternato risultati, ma come del resto è capitato a tutti a causa di un calendario difficile ed intenso. In più è stata colpita da tanti positivi a tal punto d’aver disputato una partita con appena un calciatore in panca. La dice lunga sulle difficoltà che hanno dovuto affrontare. E’ una squadra di alto livello, ma questo per noi è stimolante. Dobbiamo cercare di farli correre per andare a prenderli alle spalle. Hanno una difesa che se schierata è davvero dura superarla».
