While we don't yet know who the next coach of the Sixers will be, we do know who it won't be. Tom Thibodeau is off the market as is Steve Nash. Both were hired by the Knicks and Nets, respectively. It also won't be Villianova head coach Jay Wright, who released a statement saying that he wasn't a candidate for the position despite rampant speculation.
 Even with those coaches no longer in the mix, there's no shortage of qualified candidates for Philadelphia to consider, including Clippers assistant Tyronn Lue and Raptors assistant Adrian Griffin. The Sixers will likely take their time when it comes to selecting Brown's successor as the magnitude of the decision can't be overstated. Whoever is selected will be tasked with setting the tone for a whole new era of Sixers basketball, and leading them somewhere they haven't been since 2001: the NBA Finals.
 ## 2\. Will the front office undergo any changes?
 Brett Brown was the fall guy, and he wasn't blameless in the Sixers' struggles. Still, Philadelphia's front office should shoulder a large amount of the blame. The front office saw the direction the league was trending in, with an increasing emphasis being placed on floor-spacing and dynamic guard play, and then it constructed a team that was the complete opposite of that popular paradigm.

After an extremely disappointing 2019-20 season that saw them fall short of all expectations, the Philadelphia 76ers are making some major organizational changes in the offseason -- from the front office all the way down to the roster.
 The first major move was made shortly after the Sixers' season came to an end at the hands of the rival Boston Celtics when the organization decided to part ways with head coach Brett Brown. Over the course of his seven seasons in Philadelphia, Brown took the team from the basement to contention, but ultimately couldn't get them over the top. The 76ers are now in the midst of a search for a new head coach, led by general manager Elton Brand.
 Who they will select as Brown's successor is just one of the many questions looming large over the Sixers this offseason. Here's a look at four of the most pressing.
 ## 1\. Who will be their next head coach?
 For the first time since 2013, the Sixers are in the market for a new head coach. Whoever is eventually hired will inherit an extremely talented yet seemingly ill-fitting roster, and will enter facing immediate expectations -- something that wasn't the case when Brown was hired.

At his best, Simmons is a nightly triple-double threat and one of the best defensive players in the entire league, and the Sixers will need him to be at that level -- and available -- if they're going to reach their ceiling as a team. The Sixers have a lot of money invested in him moving forward, and thus their success is tied to his continued improvement. The hope for the Sixers is that SImmons will be able to hit the ground running under a new coach next season.
 Speaking of the new coach, it will be extremely interesting to see how whoever the Sixers hire decides to use Simmons. Brown used Simmons as the primary ball-handler for most of his tenure with the team, but he experimented with using him off ball at times over the past couple of seasons. Whoever does get the gig will have options when it comes to Simmons, and perhaps a new voice will help him unlock another level of his game.
 ## 4\. Will they trade Horford?
 The Al Horford experiment didn't work for Philadelphia. That was evident to anyone who watched the team this season. Horford doesn't fit well alongside the team's two best players in Embiid and Simmons, and in turn he struggled to find ways to make a positive impact.


--DocBreak--
The main issue is that Horford's skill set on the offensive end is redundant with Embiid and Simmons. Horford is at his best when he's operating either from the elbow or the low block. He is very comfortable with creating good looks for himself and others from these areas. The problem with that is Embiid and Simmons are also both most comfortable in these areas, especially on the low block, where Embiid does a fair share of his damage, and where Simmons is often relegated as a result of his inability to space the floor with his shot. Thus, Horford has been forced to spend a lot of time on the perimeter, where he's limited, and not especially effective.
 Horford could potentially work as a backup center, but the Sixers are paying him entirely too much for him to be relegated to a reserve role, and so a trade seems likely, even inevitable. Rumors already surfaced during the season that the Sixers would look to flip Horford for some shooting over the offseason, and that would make sense since the Sixers could certainly use some enhanced floor-spacing around Embiid and Simmons.
 The problem for Philadelphia is that finding a trade partner for Horford will be easier said than done, especially if the team is looking to secure some shooting in return. Floor-spacing is at a premium in the NBA today, while there isn't much of a market for traditional big men on the wrong side of 30 years old (Horford is 34), especially ones who still have three years and over $80 million remaining on their current contract. If the Sixers had signed Horford to a two-year deal, moving on after a single season would have been much easier. Instead, they signed him to a four-year deal, and now there's almost no chance that they'll get good value in return in a deal even if they are able to find an interested suitor. After how poorly he played in the postseason (7.0 points, 7.3 rebounds in 32.3 minutes per game), the Sixers will almost certainly have to throw in an additional asset -- or two -- to get another franchise to take on the remainder of Horford's deal.

The head of the delegation, and CEO of the company, is Hwang Woo-Suk—a once disgraced South Korean veterinary scientist who made headlines in 2005 when he claimed he had cloned human cells. He hadn't, and went from the pride of South Korea to a laughing stock overnight while claiming he had been deceived by a former colleague in the process. A few years later he began showing up in Yakutsk looking for mammoths and other prehistoric creatures. His pet cloning company makes him rich, but cloning a mammoth would bring global fame again.

After Lancs had added just 13 runs to their overnight 206/8, an autumnal day belonged to the hosts’ spring chickens. Lamb’s fifth ball took Luis Reece’s edge and provided debutant wicketkeeper George Lavelle with a maiden victim; his seventh had skipper Billy Godleman snared at first slip by Keaton Jennings; and his tenth thumped Leus du Plooy’s front pad in front of all three stumps.
 When Balderson, charging in on the breeze from the River End, swung one in to trap Wayne Madsen with the last ball of the seventh over, Derbyshire were 17/4 – their good work of the previous day undone, their hopes of a win that might propel them to a Lord’s final fading fast.
 A spell of rain broke Lancashire’s momentum; when they resumed after lunch, it took a stroke of luck to get them going again, as Matt Critchley inexplicably ducked into a Burrows full toss, and umpire George Lloyd equally strangely upheld the appeal.
 Hartley’s left-arm tweaks then seized control of one end, conceding just 24 runs from a long 16-over spell that lasted deep into the evening session. His height allows him to worry the batsmen with bounce – it didn’t prevent him swooping low to claim a stunning catch off Balderson to dismiss Fynn Hudson- Prentice. Anuj Dal edged to Jennings in Balderson’s next over, and Derbyshire were seven down before tea.
 Morley started his career with two maidens, troubling Mattie McKiernan in particular with a flat trajectory and full length.
 But in a 59-run partnership with the more fluent Harvey Hosein, who finished unbeaten on 44, McKiernan stood firm until the clouds closed in just before 6pm, leaving Lancs needing more inspiration from their battery of young guns if they are to force a result.
 Lamb said: “It’s definitely a new ball pitch, and it’s got harder from a seamer’s point of view to take wickets as it’s got older.
 “But as a unit we restricted them really well.”

Cryobanks have emerged in the past decade, often attached to museums, as a response to the rapid rise in species extinction. They offer a way to put "life on ice", stored safely away until something can be done, be that captive breeding or de-extinction. Many of these projects have eschatological overtones—the Lazarus Project, The Frozen Ark – and suggest that control can somehow be regained by turning the temperature down.
