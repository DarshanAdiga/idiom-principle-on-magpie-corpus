The increase in traffic to the Canaries comes after the European Union funded Morocco in 2019 to stop migrants from reaching southern Spain via the Mediterranean Sea. While arrivals to mainland Spain decreased by 50% compared to the same period last year, landings in the Canary Islands have increased by 550%. In August alone there were more than 850 arrivals by sea to the Canaries, according to an AP tally of numbers released by Spain's Interior Ministry and reports by local media and NGOs.

And it seems like the Sonos headphones will be apart of that ecosystem.
 The patent mentions ‘swap’ functionality that would allow whatever you’re listening to go from the headphones to the Sonos speakers on your network.
 “For example, if a particular piece of content play is currently playing on the wireless headphone, a swap changes the playback to play that piece of content on one or more other playback devices on the local network,” the patent reads.
 We’d be surprised if this feature doesn’t end of in the final product, if it ever happens. It could still be years away, but will be waiting with bated breath for these shiny Sonos headphones in the meantime.

In northeast Syria last week, a U.S. military vehicle collided with a Russian armored vehicle, injuring four American soldiers.
 Both the Americans and Russians blame each other for failing to follow established rules of the road. Had an American been killed, we could have had a crisis on our hands.
 Query: With the ISIS caliphate dead and buried, why are 500 U.S. troops still in Syria a year after Donald Trump said we would be pulling them out? What are they doing there to justify risking a clash with Russian troops who are in Syria as the invited allies of the Damascus regime of Bashar Assad, whether we approve of his regime or not?
 Nor was this the only U.S.-Russian faceoff last week.

They are not tightly regulated, and many consider that the WHO standard of 25 micrograms (µg) per m3 averaged over 24 hours is way too high and that there is no level without health effects. Munro and Seagren note that the particles from fires are even finer, usually under 0.5 microns. "These very small particles can travel far from the fire zone and readily penetrate into homes and buildings." They are so small that they can go straight through your lungs into the bloodstream.

The last few months have seen market volatility at never-seen-before levels. We saw a sharp drop, with a 30-35 per cent drop in key indices within a month. Yet, before one could even say "bear," a swift recovery also followed in the next 3-4 months, with most indices recovering smartly from their March lows, to get to their pre-COVID highs. Also, a sign of the times is that investors have more-than-ever information in their hands, useful or otherwise, leading to both analysis-paralysis and panic-stricken action.
