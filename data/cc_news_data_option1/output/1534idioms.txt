The Reserve Bank of India had on March 27 allowed banks and finance companies to offer a moratorium of three months on payment of instalments of all term loans outstanding as on March 1. This was done in light of the impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Now, subsequently the nationwide lockdown has been extended till May 3 on Tuesday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Britain is not considering lifting the lockdown imposed almost four weeks ago to control the coronavirus outbreak given "deeply worrying" increases in the death toll, a senior minister said on Sunday. Britain is at or near the peak of a health crisis in which more than 15,000 people have died - the fifth highest national death toll of a pandemic linked to at least 150,000 deaths worldwide.
 Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said a Buzzfeed report that the government was considering lifting the lockdown in phases over the coming months was not correct. "The facts and the advice are clear at the moment that we should not be thinking of lifting of these restrictions yet," Gove told Sky News.
 With hospitals under strain, health workers have criticised the government's advice that personal protective equipment (PPE) worn while treating patients infected with coronavirus could be re-used, as supplies run low across the country. An 87-tonne delivery of PPE from Turkey, which ministers had said would arrive on Sunday, has been delayed, Sky News reported.
 The latest data show 15,464 people have died in British hospitals after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, a total that has increased by more than 800 for three days running. A further 2,500 had died in care homes during the week to April 13, according to the National Care Forum, a representative body for the adult social care sector.
 "One of the things that is deeply worrying and concerning is the high level of deaths," Gove said. "The evidence suggests that the rate of infection and the death rate is flattening, but we're not absolutely certain that we are yet on a downward trajectory."
 Gove described as "grotesque" a Sunday Times story that said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had skipped five crisis meetings to address the coronavirus pandemic early in the outbreak. "The prime minister took all the major decisions. Nobody can say that the prime minister wasn't throwing heart and soul into fighting this virus," he said, adding that the story overall was "slightly off-beam".
 Jonathan Ashworth, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said this comment was "possibly the weakest rebuttal of a detailed expose in British political history".

Los empleados de NATURGY (GAS.MC) junto con la aportación de la propia empresa, han realizado una donación a Cruz Roja por importe de 1,1 millones de euros, dando así respuesta al llamamiento que esta organización humanitaria realizó para llevar a cabo diversos proyectos que contribuyan a paliar la crisis.
 El importe se destinará íntegramente a la adquisición de equipos de propiedad individual y respiradores volumétricos con material fungible, que se cederán a centros sanitarios de España. La colaboración económica de los empleados, que Naturgy ha duplicado, se donará a través de la Fundación Naturgy, que también colabora con Cruz Roja en diversos proyectos vinculados al Plan de Vulnerabilidad de la compañía.
 El Corte Inglés ha reconvertido sus talleres de costura en la madrileña calle de Tomás Bretón en un especial atelier capaz de producir mascarillas de protección, con total seguridad. El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, y la ministra de Industria, Comercio y Turismo, Reyes Maroto, realizaron una visita a los talleres de El Corte Inglés, acompañados de la presidenta de la empresa, Marta Álvarez, y del consejero delegado, Víctor del Pozo, así como del presidente de Moda España, Ángel Asensio.
 Además de la fabricación de estas mascarillas, El Corte Inglés ha donado a las administraciones material prioritario para la sanidad, sus profesionales y los enfermos de coronavirus. En este sentido, destaca la donación de 500.000 mascarillas al Ministerio de Sanidad para el personal sanitario, así como la entrega de 150.000 mascarillas a la Generalitat de Cataluña, estas últimas, procedentes de donaciones de proveedores.
 ISDIN también se ha sumado a la ola de solidaridad para la lucha contra el Covid-19 y la multinacional de productos de dermatología, "fiel a su compromiso con el personal sanitario y farmacéuticos de todo el país", ya ha donado y distribuido casi 100.000 unidades de geles hidroalcohólicos, productos para la higiene, y cremas hidratantes y de manos y faciales de su amplio catálogo.
 Estos productos ayudan a protegerse de los daños en la piel, como dermatitis, que producen las mascarillas y los elementos de protección. ISDIN ha entregado todos estos productos a cien hospitales y más de 400 centros de mayores de toda España.
 INVESTIGACIÓN
 Respecto a Gilead, trabaja desde el inicio de esta crisis con las autoridades sanitarias para encontrar una respuesta eficaz al coronavirus. Ha puesto en marcha seis ensayos clínicos para estudiar la eficacia y seguridad de Remdesivir para los que Gilead ha donado la medicación, además de su conocimiento y experiencia científica.
 Además, ha facilitado el fármaco a los pacientes más graves que no tenían otra alternativa terapéutica, a través de un programa de 'uso compasivo'. Hasta la fecha, más de 250 pacientes han recibido el tratamiento a través de este sistema en España.
 Por otro lado, la biofarmacéutica ha donado 198.000 dosis de su antirretroviral Truvada (TDF/FTC) y otras 198.000 dosis de Truvada placebo para el estudio promovido por el departamento de salud Pública del Ministerio de Sanidad, en el que se evaluará la eficacia de varias estrategias preventivas frente a la infección Covid-19 en profesionales sanitarios en contacto con pacientes infectados.
 Por último, la implicación y el compromiso de Gilead va más allá del ámbito científico y ha donado 52 equipos informáticos de última generación para el hospital de campaña levantado en Ifema, en Madrid, 40.000 mascarillas auto filtrantes FFP2 y 10.000 test de diagnóstico.
 Aquaservice, empresa líder en distribución de agua embotellada con dispensador, ha dispuesto un operativo especial para ofrecer un suministro gratuito, permanente e ilimitado para atender las necesidades del personal sanitario de más de 115 centros distribuidos por la geografía española, entre los que se encuentran hospitales públicos, hoteles medicalizados, centros sanitarios y residencias.
 Como parte de este proyecto, bautizado como 'Agua Solidaria', Aquaservice también ha suministrado gratuitamente más de 140.000 botellas de agua de 50cl. en los mismos centros destinadas a los enfermos hospitalizados por la infección de coronavirus. Para llevar a cabo esta iniciativa, la compañía ha puesto a disposición de los puntos sanitarios su sistema de distribución con equipo de repartidores propio, lo que aporta una capacidad de atención integral capaz de ofrecer suministro a los hospitales en tan solo unas horas para llevar agua allí donde más se necesita, los centros de salud.
 APLICACIÓN
 Por su parte, T-Systems se ha unido a Mercabarna para desarrollar en un día una app para llevar alimentos a los colectivos que más lo necesitan durante la crisis del Covid-19. La solución se ha creado gracias a la participación de un grupo de 20 expertos de T-Systems, junto a directivos de Mercabarna, en una hackathon de 24 horas ininterrumpidas de programación.
 La app resultante permite la colaboración 'online' de distintos agentes sociales y empresas para llevar alimentos frescos a colectivos necesitados, poniendo en contacto a mayoristas y transportistas de Mercabarna con organizaciones sociales que necesitan alimentos para atender a estos colectivos.
 La primera entidad social que se beneficiará de esta nueva aplicación será Cruz Roja Catalunya, con 90 puntos de distribución en esta comunidad. Se prevé ir incorporando progresivamente en el proyecto nuevas entidades sociales.
 SEUR está colaborando con el personal sanitario y los colectivos más vulnerables, tanto a través de su red logística en toda España y su capacidad operativa como desde la Fundación SEUR.
 La compañía, cuyos servicios son considerados esenciales y por tanto sigue activa durante el estado de alarma, ha transportado hasta el momento gratuitamente más de 240.000 mascarillas, miles de pantallas y de material sanitario y de higiene y más de 33 toneladas de alimentos para familias vulnerables de toda España donadas por el Banco de Alimentos de Madrid.
 La empresa española Peris Costumes ha donado las máscaras y trajes de seguridad que se utilizaron en la serie 'Chernobyl' para ayudar a los trabajadores de la salud y prevenir los contagios por Covid-19.
 Además, para mitigar la situación de emergencia generada por la Covid-19, la empresa ha dado un giro a su actividad habitual reconvirtiendo sus talleres de producción de vestuario para poder fabricar batas, ponchos, mascarillas y todo tipo de material de protección.
 Por su parte, Bimani ha confeccionado mascarillas y batas para distribuirlas entre hospitales para frenar cuanto antes la expansión del coronavirus y ha puesto en marcha iniciativas solidarias para recaudar fondos con el objetivo de adquirir material y recabar la colaboración de otros talleres para incrementar la producción.
 Finalmente, la 'influencer' Lucía Be, conocida por crear contenido digital y desarrollar su propia marca personal, ha donado parte de lo recaudado por la venta de camisetas para la financiación de un estudio que investigará el efecto de la inmunoterapia para tratar este nuevo virus y contribuir a la búsqueda de tratamientos.

He told CNN that Obama is an icon to his generation. He composed his request with the help of his older brother Eli after hearing that Obama had endorsed his vice president, Joe Biden, for the Democratic presidential nomination.“I just heard how he talked and remembered that’s the leader… from when I was a kid, and I think everybody, or at least most people from 2020, can remember fondly as our role model and someone who really influenced us to be the people we are today,” Debenham told KCBS. “I just feel like maybe a message that inspires young people to just keep going and not give up, that might be good.”Hi @BarackObama!

What this reality reflects is that any recommencement of economic activity will have to find fresh solutions for the demand side of the economy. Recovery isn’t just about ensuring the supply chains are up and running again, important though that be. Demand is going to be seriously suppressed, well into next year. Yes, there will be a short, sharp retail bounce when the lockdown lifts, but it won’t last. Subsequently, only a few areas of retail trade – those dealing with the essentials – are going to prosper. Those consumers who still have jobs are bound to be skittish about spending, wages will flat-line or go into reverse, and many imported items will be less available, and more expensive to boot. A tourism industry hoping to subsist on domestic tourism will struggle to find the locals willing, or able, to afford holidays away from home.

Beauty device manufacturing companies are growing new and inventive products, in light of the expanding business interest for cutting edge hair care and skin care solutions. Launching innovative beauty products in the recent years has empowered clinicians, dermatologists, and aestheticians to treat skin issues, enhance skin surface, and diminish different indications of aging. Rising frequency of skin infections, increasing discretionary income, developing aged populace, expanding consciousness among consumers and awareness about beauty devices, and developing commonness of hormonal disorders are the different elements driving the development of this industry.

 And Van Persie, current touring Asia with the Arsenal squad, told the club's official website that he is looking forward to seeing the Gunners' new recruit in action, having followed his progress in France last term.
 However, he urged fans not to expect miracles from him straight away, insisting that any new player needs time to adjust to fresh surroundings and different team-mates.
 "I know him from the highlights of the French league," he said. "I’ve seen him play a couple of times for the Ivory Coast and I’ve been speaking to [Emmanuel] Eboue and he was very positive about him.
 "The things I’ve seen look great but we will have to wait and see how he adapts. Every new player that comes in needs time so he will need a couple of months to feel at home and hopefully he can play his best football."
 The Dutchman also welcomed the competition for places that Gervinho's arrival will bring to the Emirates Stadium outfit.
 "I think it is a good thing that you have competition. Everyone needs competition because no one really wants to go to sleep," he said.
 "I think in the ideal world, no one is really sure of his place. Maybe the captain and the goalkeeper but all the others shouldn’t be known before that they will play. It’s good to have competition and be on your toes."
 And Van Persie encouraged manager Arsene Wenger to continue adding to the squad, as the Gunners seek to end a six-year silverware drought.
 "The way I feel now is that new signings are more than welcome, why not? Every other team is buying quality players so hopefully we will do the same. If you look at Manchester City buying loads of good players and Liverpool is doing it now and Manchester United has been doing it for years. If everyone is doing something you need to do it as well."

As public school buildings in Mississippi remain closed for the rest of the semester, it’s up to each school district to ensure that their students continue learning.
 Some, like the Booneville School District, already had the infrastructure in place to teach their students online.
 Booneville was designated as a District of Innovation in 2017, in part to provide online classes to other schools in the state. Booneville superintendent Todd English said there are 330 students at Booneville High School, but online instruction is provided to 1,100 students from other districts.
 Having already had distance learning in action for grades 5-12 made it easier to create a plan for grades K-4 on the fly, English said.
 Even for Booneville, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of online connectivity for some kids. If educational materials and feedback are not provided for those students, the achievement gap will grow exponentially next year, so the district is trying to reach them in any way possible.
 “Although every kid may not have the internet and every kid may not have a laptop, especially in lower grades, most every kids’ parents have a data plan on their cell phone,” English said.
 They’re sharing read aloud videos and educational games that younger students can access with smartphones and physical instructional packets are also available.
 “The old model is you take the bus to the students to bring the students to the teacher,” English said. “The new model is you take the teacher to the students, and you figure out whatever hurdle remains one at a time and address that hurdle as best you can.”
 New Albany School District superintendent Dr. Lance Evans said that by the third day of COVID-19 closures, his district’s online learning plan was up and running.
 At least one hour per day and three days per week, New Albany teachers work with students in a virtual classroom setting. Teachers also have established office hours on Fridays for any remediation or accommodations that students may need.
 “It’s working just like it does in our normal classroom setting,” Evans said.
 New Albany typically holds summer classes to offer remediation opportunities for students who need to master subjects to move to the next grade level in the fall. Evans said the district already had plans in place to do a lot of the virtual learning they’re currently offering starting this summer, but the COVID-19 pandemic “increased that timeline greatly.”
 “Although it’s been a very difficult time for our country, a difficult time for our students, I also see it as an opportunity to reinvent teaching and learning and education in our country,” Evans said.
 Tupelo Public School District superintendent Dr. Rob Picou said his district’s distance learning plan has gone phenomenally well due to the efforts of teachers, principals, coaches, support staff and parents.
 “We are not only trying to deliver educational services in an equitable way with unfamiliar technology, but we are also trying to attend to the social and emotional needs of students who have had their worlds turned upside down,” Picou said.
 TPSD is already creating a “blueprint for the summer and for next year” that will include a greater commitment to “blended learning,” which is a combination of technology access and old school learning methods.
 “I believe access to technology is important and technology can certainly be a great accelerant to the classroom experience, but we should also remember there was education and learning before we had technology,” Picou said.
 The district will look at using textbooks and other learning resources to add to the technology tools in place for “a more accountable and complete education experience.”
 “I have always believed the toughest metal is forged in the hottest fire,” Picou said. “Our students, school staff, and our parents are going to emerge on the other side of this crisis stronger, more resilient, more committed to each other, and focused on the value of community, friends, family and faith.”
 Lee County School District superintendent Coke Magee said that with schools closed for the rest of the semester, his district will continue to provide learning opportunities to its students as best it can.
 Education is “a relationship business,” Magee said, so the lack of social interaction with distance learning is difficult for both students and teachers.
 LCSD is offering resources online and paper packets that can be picked up during meal distributions for students each week. Magee said parents and students have been helpful in reaching out to suggest improvements, and the district is always looking for new ways to provide student support.
 The only thing that he asks is for principals, teachers and parents to be patient as everyone works together to find the best solutions during this unprecedented situation.
 “Every day brings about a new challenge,” Magee said. “We’re going to continue to find ways to meet those challenges, but it’s just hard to schedule something a month down the road right now.”
 Oxford School District superintendent Brian Harvey said that more than 95% of students in his district have participated in distance learning so far, but the district continues to try and reach the less than 5% that have not.
 In some situations, paper packets have been provided but the district is also working on creative ways to make sure all of its students are able to access classes online.
 One option is to provide C Spire personal MiFi hotspots to students who live in a remote location without internet. But if there’s a cluster of students without access in one particular area, Harvey said, the solution will be to park a bus equipped with WiFi in a neighborhood for student use. The district is also talking with MaxxSouth Broadband to see about getting cable internet in homes.
 For those students who are participating in online learning, OSD outlined a platform of expectations for teachers and students early on regarding work, grading, etc. that has helped things go more smoothly.
 “I can tell you that learning has continued • and it may not be in the standards, but learning has happened,” Harvey said. “Kids have learned, teachers have learned, superintendents have learned. We’ve all had to adjust and rethink.”
 Harvey thinks the lessons learned during this pandemic will ultimately benefit education.
 “This will pass and we will come out of it,” Harvey said. “We’re going to be better for it and we’ll all have different skills, abilities and talents that are weaknesses now, but they will become strengths.”
