The Five Lamps junction has become a notorious black spot for accidents with several crashes reported in recent months.
 It led to Derby City Council facing calls to improve safety in the area.
 In October last year, the Tory-led authority said it had planned to install more traffic lights at the junction to help reduce the number of accidents.
 A spokesman said at the time: "After analysing data, we are proposing to install additional traffic lights to ensure that any vehicles in the ‘U’ turn queue (from Garden Street into Duffield Road) do not proceed across the junction until Kedleston Road has finished running a green light."
 But that work has not yet started.
