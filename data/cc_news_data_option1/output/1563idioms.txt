 LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As environmentalists celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day this week, a new documentary poses a sobering question.
 What if wind farms, solar panels and other green energy projects are not enough to save the planet and humanity simply cannot sustain life as we know it?
 "Planet of the Humans," executive produced by Oscar-winning filmmaker Michael Moore and written and directed by Jeff Gibbs, asks hard questions about what it sees as the failure of well-meaning efforts to halt climate change.
 "It seems like we have been losing the battle," Moore told Reuters. "We are in deep, deep trouble."
 "Planet of the Humans," which will be released on YouTube https://youtu.be/Zk11vI-7czE on Tuesday free of charge to the public, argues that the mainstream environmental movement has sold out to corporate interests and that solar and wind energy components and electric cars rely too heavily on deforestation and electricity generated from coal and natural gas to produce them.
 "What we have been calling green, renewable energy and industrial civilization are one and the same thing - desperate measures not to save the planet but to save our way of life," Gibbs says in the film.
 A better approach, Gibbs suggests, would be people having fewer children. "Infinite growth on a finite planet is suicide," he says.
 The multi-year film project includes interviews with scientists, industrialists and environmental activists, visits to wind farms, solar installations and biomass plants, and an in-depth look at the companies that collaborate and invest in green energy initiatives.
 Moore said that he, like many people, thought electric cars were a good idea, "but I didn't really think about where is the electricity coming from?"
 "I assumed solar panels would last for ever. I didn't know what went into the making of them," Moore added, referring to raw materials, including quartz, and the fossil fuels needed to manufacture the panels.
 Moore and Gibbs acknowledge the film is bleak in parts but said they hope it will stimulate discussion. Both men will take part in a live Q&A on Wednesday at 10 pm ET (0200 GMT Thursday) on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
 "The film doesn't have all the answers but it challenges us to think differently," Gibbs said.
 Gibbs and Moore said the mass shutdowns and plummeting air travel that have been one impact from the coronavirus have shown how swiftly the planet could benefit from a change.
 The economic standstill could cause carbon dioxide emissions to fall this year by the largest amount since World War Two, the chair of the Global Carbon Project said earlier this month.
 "The fact that within days animals are coming back and the skies are blue tells us that we don't have to build a million square miles of solar panels or buy a zillion electric cars. If we just slow down and stop we can make a tremendous difference instantly," said Gibbs.
 "I think this is a good chance, this 50th (Earth Day)anniversary, to think through who we are, what we've become as an environmental movement, and where we should be going next," he said.

The historic rout in oil markets that sent US crude prices plummeting to as much as minus USD 40 a barrel is unlikely to translate into any big reduction in petrol and diesel prices in India as domestic pricing is based on different benchmark, and refineries are already filled up to brim and cannot buy US crude just yet.With storage capacity already overflowing amid coronavirus-induced demand collapse, traders rushed to to get rid of unwanted stocks triggering the collapse of US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for May delivery.Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh said the collapse was triggered by traders unable to take deliveries of crude they had previously booked because of a demand collapse. And so they paid the seller to keep oil in their storage.If you look at June futures, it is trading in positive territory... Around USD 20 per barrel, he said.Low oil prices may seem good in short-term but in the long run it will hurt the oil economy as producers will have no surplus to invest in exploration and production which will lead to a drop in production, he said.He did not comment on retail fuel prices that have been static since March 16.Oil companies have not changed rates despite a fall in international prices as they first adjusted them against the increase that was warranted from a Rs 3 per litre hike in excise duty and close to Re 1 per litre additional cost of switching over to cleaner BS-VI grade fuel from April 1.Petrol in Delhi is priced at Rs 69.59 a litre and diesel comes for Rs 62.29 per litre.The negative price has no direct impact on India or Indian oil prices, as this has taken place due to crude oil produced and traded within the US. Indias prices are driven partly by another benchmark, the Brent, which is still trading at USD 25barrel. Therefore, the retail price of fuels in India are unlikely to fall, said Amit Bhandari, Fellow, Energy and Environment Studies, Gateway House.Also, Indian refineries are already overflowing as fuel demand has evaporated due to the unprecedented nationwide lockdown imposed to curb spread of COVID-19. So, they cant rush to buy US crude.The refineries have already cut operating rate to half because the fuel they produce has not been sold yet.India imports 4 million barrelsday (1.4 billion barrelsyear) of oil. The country has been benefitting from the falling prices of oil for the last five years, when oil dropped from a peak of USD 110barrel to USD 50-60barrel last year, enabling India to invest in public service programmes.However, the additional USD 30 fall of this week is good for India - but there is also a downside. If oil prices are too low, the economies of oil-rich gulf countries will be hurt, threatening the job prospects of the 8 million Indians working in the Gulf countries. India is the largest recipient of foreign remittances due to these workers very low oil prices will hurt this cash stream, Bhandari said.

L'opera e rimasta a meta: l'ultimo murale di Ortica Memoria sarebbe stato inaugurato il 25 Aprile, 75esimo anniversario della Liberazione. Il lockdown imposto a tutte le citta per l'emergenza coronavirus ha impedito di finirlo e l'inaugurazione pubblica, quindi, slitta - e il caso di dirlo - a data da destinarsi. Ma Milano vuole festeggiare comunque la Festa della Liberazione, mostrando a tutti quei volti di partigiani abbozzati sul muro di via Tucidide - in pieno quartiere Ortica - disegnati dal collettivo Orticanoodles, che gia aveva realizzato negli anni scorsi gli altri murales del progetto Orme.

Η κατάρρευση του αργού πετρελαίου σε ιστορικά χαμηλά των τελευταίων 30 ετών επιδρά αρνητικά και στην Wall Street, που άνοιξε με σοβαρές απώλειες για τους τρεις βασικούς δείκτες της. Η αμερικανική αγορά προσπαθεί να προσαρμοστεί στα τελευταία δεδομένα σχετικά με την προοπτική σταδιακών μέτρων χαλάρωσης με προσεκτικές κινήσεις, ωστόσο το ιστορικό κραχ στις τιμές του πετρελαίου στην κερδοσκοπική προθεσμιακή αγορά της Νέας Υόρκης κρατά τις τιμές στο «κόκκινο». Πιο αναλυτικά, ο βιομηχανικός δείκτης Dow Jones διολισθαίνει κατά 2,03% και διαπραγματεύεται στις 23.170,97 μονάδες. Ο ευρύτερος S&P 500 κινείται πτωτικά κατά 1,67% στις 2.775,99 μονάδες και ο τεχνολογικός Nasdaq υποχωρεί κατά 1,66% στις 8.418,61 μονάδες. Πτωτικά συνεχίζουν να κινούνται και τα ευρωπαϊκά χρηματιστήρια, με το βλέμμα των επενδυτών στην καθίζηση των τιμών του πετρελαίου. Η ιστορική βουτιά των τιμών του πετρελαίου τη Δευτέρα, με το sell-off να συνεχίζεται και σήμερα έχει πλήξει καίρια την επενδυτική ψυχολογία. Επιπλέον, οι αναλυτές προειδοποιούν ότι το ανεξέλεγκτο ξεπούλημα στην αγορά του πετρελαίου είναι πολύ πιθανό να προκαλέσει ένα κύμα μαζικών χρεοκοπιών στην αγορά τους επόμενους μήνες, δυσχεραίνοντας την έξοδο της οικονομίας από την ύφεση. Στο μεταξύ, ο Αμερικανός πρόεδρος, Ντόναλντ Τραμπ, ανακοίνωσε μέσω του λογαριασμού του στο Twitter ότι σχεδιάζει να υπογράψει μια εκτελεστική διαταγή για την προσωρινή αναστολή της μετανάστευσης στις ΗΠΑ. «Υπό το πρίσμα της επίθεσης του Αόρατου Εχθρού και με βάση την ανάγκη να προστατέψουμε τις θέσεις εργασίας των σπουδαίων πολιτών των ΗΠΑ, θα υπογράψω μια εκτελεστική διαταγή για την προσωρινή αναστολή της μετανάστευσης στις ΗΠΑ», αναφέρει στην ανάρτηση του ο Αμερικανός πρόεδρος.

Palermo, 21 apr. (Adnkronos) - Risalgono al 2009 i primi smottamenti del terreno ai piedi del Monte Falcone a Baucina, nel Palermitano. Nella periferia a sud del centro abitato sono, infatti, notevoli i danni causati alla pavimentazione del cimitero, con infiltrazioni di acqua e lesioni in alcune tombe e cappelle, con pericolo per l'incolumità dei visitatori. E' per questo che la Struttura contro il dissesto idrogeologico, guidata dal presidente della Regione siciliana Nello Musumeci, ha prima programmato, e subito dopo finanziato, i lavori di consolidamento e di messa in sicurezza. Un'opera per la quale l'Ufficio diretto da Maurizio Croce - che in queste settimane ha potenziato i livelli di operatività e di produttività precedenti alla diffusione del Coronavirus - ha portato a termine la relativa gara che oggi vede in cima alla graduatoria - con un ribasso del 31,7 per cento, su un importo di 240mila euro - la Gangi Impianti. Il progetto mira a migliorare le condizioni di stabilità del pendio su cui insiste il cimitero. Sono previsti interventi di recupero e di ripristino delle strutture murarie che lo cingono ai quattro lati e di protezione idraulica per eliminare le infiltrazioni mediante una trincea drenante. Verrà, inoltre, costruito un muro in cemento armato della lunghezza di sessanta metri a monte della parte vecchia del cimitero, che è quella più compromessa dal dissesto in atto. Si procederà infine con la pulizia e la rimozione delle sterpaglie lungo il muro perimetrale.

More frightening than any horror flick's GGI ghoul, the cowled Klansman that comes face to face with Herman Levin (Morgan Spector) and his son Sandy (Caleb Malis) is sure to give viewers gooseflesh while watching the finale of _The Plot Against America_. It's one of the six-part miniseries' many captivating highlights, a testament to the talents of executive producers David Simon and Ed Burns (both of _The Wire_ fame), Pulitzer Prize winning author Philip Roth (whose novel of the same name serves as the source material), and the keen eye of episode director Thomas Schlamme ( _The West Wing_ ). Aside from being a grippingly horrific scene on a technical level, the Klansman facedown is rendered all the more effective by audiences' increasing concerns of such blatant hate becoming commonplace in their own lives. Indeed, Simon and Burns' decision to adapt Roth's alternative history cautionary tale, where Nazi sympathizer Charles Lindbergh ascends to the presidency while Europe is engulfed by the Second World War, couldn't be more timely in our alt-right era.

Also bear in mind the family sensitivities, the individual and his lawyer. It has huge ramifications for all involved. If there is a key piece of evidence, which is integral to the case and pivotal in the defense, then it seems absolutely appropriate for us to look at that — properly in that context and in that light — and in Bryan's case, that CCTV footage was critical to any understanding of what happened that day and the defense he was able to make."

Las fiestas de los Sanfermines, conocidas en todo el mundo por sus encierros de toros, fueron suspendidas para este año debido a la pandemia de coronavirus, anuncio este martes el Ayuntamiento de la ciudad de Pamplona.La salud es lo primero, afirmo la alcaldesa en funciones, Ana Elizalde, durante una rueda de prensa, en la que no descarto que los festejos puedan celebrarse varios meses despues de su fecha tradicional, entre el 6 y el 14 de julio de cada año, para lo que dijo que habria flexibilidad.Elizalde es alcaldesa en funciones porque el titular, Enrique Maya, esta precisamente convaleciente de COVID-19.La responsable municipal reconocio que la suspension, por muy esperada que fuese, no deja de producirnos a todos un poso de tristeza.Los Sanfermines, famosos por las carreras de mozos junto a toros de lidia por las calles del casco historico de Pamplona, son las mejores fiestas del mundo, destaco Elizalde.Ademas, el programa festivo incluye centenares de actividades de todo tipo, como decenas de conciertos musicales, y un concurso internacional de fuegos artificiales, en una semana en la que se paraliza casi toda la actividad de esta ciudad de 200.000 habitantes y capital de la historica region autonoma de Navarra.El año pasado, Pamplona acogio algo mas de 521.000 turistas en esas fiestas, de las que el 44 por ciento (230.000) llegaron desde otros paises, segun datos oficiales.Estas fiestas fueron popularizadas por algunas obras del escritor estadounidense Ernest Hemingway y por ello son muy celebres en el mundo de habla inglesa, aunque las retransmisiones de los encierros por television las han llevado a todos los rincones del planeta.Aunque a lo largo de su historia ha habido varias suspensiones de las fiestas en honor de San Fermin, es la primera vez en los dos ultimos siglos que se toma esta decision por una epidemia, pese a que las ha habido de colera o gripe española, segun recuerda el historiador local Miguel Izu.

Palermo, 21 apr. (Adnkronos) - Risalgono al 2009 i primi smottamenti del terreno ai piedi del Monte Falcone a Baucina, nel Palermitano. Nella periferia a sud del centro abitato sono, infatti, notevoli i danni causati alla pavimentazione del cimitero, con infiltrazioni di acqua e lesioni in alcune tombe e cappelle, con pericolo per l’incolumita dei visitatori. E’ per questo che la Struttura contro il dissesto idrogeologico, guidata dal presidente della Regione siciliana Nello Musumeci, ha prima programmato, e subito dopo finanziato, i lavori di consolidamento e di messa in sicurezza. Un’opera per la quale l’Ufficio diretto da Maurizio Croce - che in queste settimane ha potenziato i livelli di operativita e di produttivita precedenti alla diffusione del Coronavirus - ha portato a termine la relativa gara che oggi vede in cima alla graduatoria - con un ribasso del 31,7 per cento, su un importo di 240mila euro - la Gangi Impianti. Il progetto mira a migliorare le condizioni di stabilita del pendio su cui insiste il cimitero. Sono previsti interventi di recupero e di ripristino delle strutture murarie che lo cingono ai quattro lati e di protezione idraulica per eliminare le infiltrazioni mediante una trincea drenante. Verra, inoltre, costruito un muro in cemento armato della lunghezza di sessanta metri a monte della parte vecchia del cimitero, che e quella piu compromessa dal dissesto in atto. Si procedera infine con la pulizia e la rimozione delle sterpaglie lungo il muro perimetrale.

“When I first started out writing it, my goal was to do a black ‘When Harry Met Sally,’” said Prince-Bythewood with a laugh. “I love that movie, but I wasn’t seeing myself in movies like that, in love stories.

 “As an artist, you hope you’re making art that resonates and reaches people, but you never know,” she added. “So the fact that 20 years later we’re still talking about my first film is humbling and amazing to me. Especially when I think back to trying to get it made and knowing how many times it was dead in the water.”
 Prince-Bythewood says executive producer Spike Lee had a major impact on her ability to get the film made. “I think Spike’s involvement was probably the thing that allowed New Line to say, ‘Just let her direct her script’ because I’m sure in their minds if I started messing up, they knew Spike could step in and ‘save me.’ Thankfully I didn’t need that.”
 “I go on the first day, wish everybody luck and then I’m out,” said Lee, of his producing role. “I don’t want them to feel like ‘Spike Lee is looking over my shoulder.’ If I don’t have confidence in them I wouldn’t make the film with them.

Religare Broking, the arm of financial services group Religare Enterprises, on Tuesday said it has witnessed a whopping 50 per cent upswing in trading volumes from online platforms during the nationwide lockdown.The company's trading volumes have shot up, especially on its mobile app&amp;nbsp; Religare Dynami&amp;nbsp; driven by a significant behavioural shift by traders and investors towards self-execution model, even as the firm has ensured near total operational continuity as it moved to 100 per cent work from home mode for client servicing and operations team.Besides, leveraging of relevant technology such as cloud telephony-based solutions as well as seamless new e-collection mode of payments for customers, who are otherwise used to transferring funds through physical cheques and net banking, have sustained this spike.The growth has been seen since the nationwide lockdown was imposed.''We were able to adapt to the situation quite early and ensured that the critical operations were up and running from home,before the lock-down. We ensured that even while we shift to a work-from-home model, business continues with minimal disruption and client needs are addressed in real-time&amp;nbsp; through smart and efficient use of technological solutions,&quot; Religare Broking CEO Nitin Aggarwal said in a statement.&quot;As a result, our online trading platforms, both the web portal and the 'Dynami' mobile app have actually seen a spike in number of active customers and transactions during the period of the lock-down,&quot; he added.The same approach to business continuity has been followed by other subsidiaries of Religare Enterprises, which has allowed the Group to continue operations without any business disruption.

In the looming economic crisis in the post-COVID-19 world, India could emerge as a great economy if it plays its cards well right now. Its dominant rural population engaged in agricultural and Allied Industries could hold the key to its fortunes and establish the nation as the &amp;lsquo;Granary of the World&amp;rsquo; meeting essential needs at premium prices. With a little push in the right direction from the government, introduction of corporate culture in agriculture and skillful management of the immediate crisis, India could well be on the map of the strongest economies in the world once the COVID-19 eclipse begins to wane.Though there are imminent challenges in the battle against COVID-19 such as inflation, unemployment, deepening poverty but if India moves from its &amp;lsquo;Make in India&amp;rsquo; approach to a new &amp;lsquo;Grow in India&amp;rsquo; strategy there is a new dawn awaiting the country. We need to disabuse ourselves of the notion that manufacturing will shift to India because China has taken a hit right now.Of course, first we need to set our own house in order and address the urgent issues of stranded migrant labour and support to farmers to help them store their perishable goods. I have spoken to farmers who say while they are not affected by COVID-19 and are harvesting their produce, the only stumbling block is reaching their produce to the mandis in towns. Labour, in fact, has been more readily available as several migrant workers have returned home. Even if some of the perishable items are going waste, they are being sold at higher prices making up for the farmer&amp;rsquo;s losses.In India, rural folk is largely engaged in agriculture and allied activities. This section constitutes 70 percent of the total population. The harvest season from January to April is upon us and Rabi crops like wheat, soya bean, and several other food grains will soon begin to hit the markets that have begun to run dry. The 21+19 day nationwide lockdown has led to emptying godowns due to panic buying and increased consumption during this period. As the agricultural produce begins to reach the mandis, farmers can hope to make far better gains, thanks to increased demand.Agriculture contributes 15 percent to the GDP and majority of the population engaged in this sector is unlikely to have any major impact since the resources, essentially cheap labour will continue to be available freely. Also, apart from India, there will be a high demand for food grains across the globe. There could possibly even be a food crisis around the world and India should use this as an opportunity to develop and sell &amp;lsquo;Grow In India&amp;rsquo; on priority. It would pave the way to meet the global demands and feed the entire world, thus earning the sobriquet &amp;lsquo;Granary of the World&amp;rsquo;.As Mahatma Gandhi had once said, &amp;lsquo;India lives in its villages&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;agriculture is the soul of the Indian economy&amp;rsquo;, this could be that opportunity to become the &amp;lsquo;land of glory.&amp;rsquo; India is blessed to have all the requisite resources &amp;mdash; land, high population which means aplenty cheap labour, water for irrigation among other basics. These could be channelised to productive use. Introducing corporate culture in farming &amp;amp; Allied Industries could derive optimum results since the agricultural sector is neglected and has unfortunately never been the government&amp;rsquo;s priority despite its dependability in times of crisis. Demonetization in November 2016 and the COVID-19 impact has largely familiarised Indians with technology and pushed more and more people to engage with it while digital payments have helped sustain livelihoods.The top world economies &amp;mdash; America, China, Japan &amp;amp; Germany and several other European and western countries presently are the worst affected due to the Corona impact. It will take them a very long period to recover and be self-sufficient and then cater to the global needs for food and food-related items though they were exporting food and food-related items to the world. Today the world looks at India for supplies of the anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine and as many as 25 nations are drawing their requirements from us, but soon the world will run out of the basic essentials such as food grains and there too India could step in.Consider this &amp;mdash; India is the largest producer of milk and accounts for 19 percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s milk production, the second-largest fruit and sugar producer, third-largest farm and agricultural producer and is the sixth- largest food and grocery market (as per a Ministry of Agriculture report).On the other hand, India's essential items dependence on foreign nations is for Oil and petroleum-related products. Hence India is in a position to convert the current crisis into advantage by feeding hungry mouths across nations.Of, course there are issues closer home that need urgent attention. The government must step up its relief measures for the 4.5 crore migrant daily wage workers as they make their way back home. Images that have come out so far of migrant workers walking along highways, without food and water, have been devastating, to say the least. Inflation, unemployment and poverty stare at us and the lower and underprivileged sections of society are inevitably going to be the worst affected due to the emerging economic crisis. The government, as well as the corporates, will be hard-hit since manufacturing and services will bear the major impact of the economic crisis. In turn, the government&amp;rsquo;s direct and indirect tax collection will be reduced to

In light of Facebook’s, and especially Messenger’s, massive share in reporting CSAM to NCMEC, in February 2020, 129 signatories had urged the company to resist introducing end-to-end encryption on Facebook’s messaging platforms, and their subsequent integration. End-to-end encryption, which is already the default on Facebook-owned WhatsApp, disallows anyone, except the sender and the receiver, to monitor the communication in any way, thereby turning all communication opaque to any automated or manual monitoring for CSAM. Thus far, Facebook has primarily relied on automated monitoring of content on its social media platform and on Messenger to report and take down CSAM.

HILO, Hawaii (AP) — Daily arrests on Hawaii's Big Island have plunged 33% since the governor issued a stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Hawaii County Police Department said. Hawaii Police Chief Ferreira confirmed the decrease in arrests during the period after Democratic Gov. David Ige's emergency proclamation took effect March 25, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Monday. The decrease has various explanations, including an expanded use of citations by officers to deal with some crimes, Ferreira said. “We’re not actively going out there and pursuing (suspects on) bench warrants,” Ferreira said. “In other words, if you got a traffic ticket in February, and you got a bench warrant for not appearing in court, we’re not even looking at those warrants.\" Arrests for bench warrants would likely result in release and a court dates later in the year, Ferreira said. Another factor in reduced arrest figures is the smaller number of people committing crimes in their vehicles, including driving under the influence. \"Because the bars are closed, and because of the stay-at-home order, you have less people on the roadway,” Ferreira said. Officers continue to arrest people wanted for violating terms of parole, Ferreira said. “And any sort of violent crime, those arrests are going to happen,” he said. Some who have been arrested and charged with serious property crimes have had judges eliminate their cash bail during their initial court appearances because of state Supreme Court-mandated population reductions in the state’s jails and prisons because of the coronavirus. “Nobody wants to see an outbreak, anywhere, and officers don’t want to crowd the jails, either,” Ferreira said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has detained two men believed to be ethnic Rohingya from Myanmar for suspected trafficking of illegal migrants, maritime officials said on Tuesday.
 The arrests were made following investigations into the arrival of a boat carrying 202 suspected Rohingya refugees to Malaysia earlier this month, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) said in a statement.
 It said a 36-year-old man believed to be Rohingya and carrying documents from the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR was arrested at a house in Malaysia's northern Kedah state on April 17.
 A second man, aged 31, was detained two days later, the MMEA's state deputy director of operations Zulinda Ramly said.
 "Both suspects are believed to have acted as masterminds and land agents who handled the entry and exit of illegal migrants," she said, adding that a third suspect was still at large.
 Malaysia, which does not recognise refugee status, is a favoured destination for ethnic Rohingya fleeing violence in Myanmar and squalid conditions at refugee camps in Bangladesh.
 Lured by traffickers, hundreds attempt the perilous voyage to Malaysia on overcrowded, rickety vessels each year.
 Buddhist-majority Myanmar does not recognise Rohingya as citizens and they face severe curbs on freedom of movement as well as access to healthcare and education.
 Myanmar denies persecuting Rohingya and says they are not an indigenous ethnic group but immigrants from South Asia.
 More than a million live in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, the majority having been driven from homes in Myanmar after a 2017 military crackdown the army said was a response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.
 Rights groups fear coronavirus lockdowns across Southeast Asia could trigger a repeat of a 2015 crisis when a crackdown by Thailand prompted smugglers to abandon their human cargo at sea.
 At least 32 ethnic Rohingya died and hundreds were left starving on a ship that drifted for weeks after failing to reach Malaysia, Bangladesh officials said last week.
 In a separate case, Malaysia turned away another boat carrying 200 suspected Rohingya on Thursday after providing them with food supplies.

Daniel Boyd "Dan" Byers FOLLY BEACH - It is with great sadness that the family of Daniel Boyd (Dan) Byers announces his passing on April 16, 2020, after a long courageous battle with pulmonary fibrosis. He was the son of Ralph C. and Mary Jeane Byers. Dan was born on November 21, 1956, in Rock Hill, South Carolina. He spent his childhood years in the upstate of South Carolina and in Macon, Georgia. Dan attended Stratford Academy in Macon, Georgia, and graduated from Northwestern High School in Rock Hill in 1975. He attended the University of Georgia and was a dedicated member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity .He graduated with a Business Degree from Gardner Webb College in 1980 ,where he was a member of the golf team. His business career encompassed banking, real estate, and medical device sales in the Southeast United States. Dan was blessed with an uncanny ability to make friends , and was passionate about maintaining those friendships throughout his life. He had an infectious sense of humor and was the life of the party. Dan was a caring person and would always bend over backwards to assist anyone in need. Throughout the years he has maintained close relationships with many of his Sigma Chi brothers and high school friends. He took advantage of every opportunity to visit with them and reminisce about their great times together.

While Spector and Malis work wonders conveying the dread of middle class American Jews threatened by anti-semitic riots, the episode's most memorable moments are provided by Zoe Kazan. As Levin matriarch Bess, Kazan is viscerally relatable while trying to comfort one victim of prejudice over the phone, while also desperately determining how to protect her own children who lay vulnerably asleep upstairs. Later in the episode, Bess' emotionally galling confrontations with sister Evelyn Finkel (Winona Ryder, palpably portraying one of the era's countless diminished women) also make Kazan a clear early favorite for TV actress of the year.

JEFFERSON, S.D. (AP) — Racing promoters plan to go ahead with an event at a track in Jefferson this weekend with some modifications for social distancing. Sprint car promoter and racing veteran Terry McCarl is bringing the Open Wheel Nationals to Park Jefferson Speedway on Saturday. But, the drivers won't be racing for a packed house. Instead only 700 tickets have been sold for a speedway that seats more than 4,000, KELO-TV reported. McCarl says that should give each person more than six feet of distance from each other. Concessions will be limited with distancing marks on the ground. And attendees are encouraged to bring a covering for their faces. Gov. Krisit Noem is one of the few governors who hasn’t issued a statewide stay-at-home order.

Chandigarh, Apr 21 (PTI) The Punjab government on Tuesday sought from the Centre an interim compensation of Rs 3,000 crore for the month of April in view of "alarming resource gap" and also demanded permission for sale of liquor to mobilise excise revenue.
 Pointing to the alarming resource gap between the state's anticipated receipts and committed expenditure, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday demanded interim compensation to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore for the month of April on account of the COVID-19 national disaster, said a government statement here.
 In a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the chief minister also asked for expediting the release of the state's GST arrears of Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months, to help overcome resource constraint.       Stating that the lockdown had substantial fiscal consequences for all states, Singh said the central government should compensate Punjab for its loss of revenue due to COVID-19.
 While the Rs 3,000 crore for April was an estimate, he said "detailed assessment of loss and requirement of funds for relief and rehabilitation will be submitted in due course,".
 However, he stressed that the Centre should provide interim assistance so that the fight against COVID-19 is not allowed to weaken in any way.
 Punjab was facing a huge stress on account of the required health and relief measures that are being continuously scaled up, "with hardly any revenue receipts accruing to the state during these days due to near complete shutdown of trade, business and industry", the chief minister said.
 The state government had made a provision of revenue receipts of Rs 3,360 crore for the month of April 2020 in the state budget 2020-21.
 It comprised Rs 1,322 crore of GST, Rs 465 crore of VAT on petroleum, Rs 521 crore state excise revenue, Rs 198 crore of Motor Vehicle Tax, Rs 243 crore of electricity duty, Rs 219 crore of stamp duty and non-tax revenue of Rs 392 crore.        The chief minister observed that these receipts are expected to decline sharply as most economic activities in the state remain closed on account of the lockdown.
 The receipts on account of state GST, integrated GST, VAT, excise, stamp duty and motor vehicle taxes are almost negligible and the reduced electricity consumption has resulted in a drop of 60 per cent of the expected revenue from electricity duty during April 2020, he said.         On the other hand, he pointed out, the committed expenditure of the state which is debt servicing, pensions, salaries, relief measures for COVID-19, health care and infrastructure etc., is budgeted at Rs 7,301 crore for the month of April 2020, resulting in the huge resource gap between the anticipated receipts and committed expenditure.         Pointing to the "critical" fiscal situation of the state, the CM also sought the Centre's permission to allow sale of liquor, in a phased manner, to mop up value added tax and excise revenue.        The Home Ministry should "allow the state to take a conscious decision to allow the sale of liquor in certain areas in a phased manner with strict social distancing and other measures to prevent COVID-19", he said.        This would help the state immensely in its efforts to scale up the relief and health care measures to combat COVID-19 and meet some, if not all, of its committed liabilities and other day-to-day expenses, he said.         Singh requested the Home Minister for early action, while assuring him of the state's full and continued support in the efforts of the government of India to overcome the present crisis by effectively managing and containing the COVID-19. Notably, the Punjab government has projected collection of Rs 6,250 crore from the sale of liquor for 2020-21 in the state, which is known for its high consumption. PTI CHS VSD

LONDON -- Britain's economy is not certain to recover rapidly once coronavirus restrictions are lifted as people may be reluctant to spend or socialize as they did before, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane warned on Tuesday.
 Last week Britain's budget watchdog said the economy could shrink by 35% in the second quarter but might then recover reasonably fast if curbs on everyday life were relaxed over the following three months.
 Haldane said the economic shock from the coronavirus - which only started to be felt in Britain from mid-March - was enough for the economy to have contracted over the first quarter as a whole, and would lead to a "very ugly" first half of 2020.
 But in line with recent comments from fellow BoE officials Silvana Tenreyro and Ben Broadbent, Haldane questioned how strong the bounce-back would be in the second half of the year.
 "There will certainly be some recovery, there will certainly be a bounce. Will it bounce back immediately…? That is an open question," he said in a podcast for the Institute for Government think tank.
 "Even after those policies are relaxed, there is certainly a chance that people might be reluctant themselves to want to spend too vigorously, or to go out and socialize too much."
 Britain's government has been loath to talk about its exit strategy for the coronavirus shutdown that began on March 23 - even as other European countries plan to reopen shops and schools - as the death toll in Britain is still climbing fast.
 But some business groups have said tax cuts - for example to levies on property purchases - might be needed to jump start activity once the worst of the crisis is over.
 Economists at Citi said finance minister Rishi Sunak might also consider reducing social security contributions rather than immediately trying to consolidate the public finances after a borrowing spree on a scale not seen since World War Two.
 Haldane said the BoE's 200 billion pounds of fresh bond purchases were helping to keep a lid on British government borrowing costs, but should not be mistaken for a cash handout to the government or "monetary financing" of the budget deficit.
 "What's not happening is not that the government's running a big fiscal deficit therefore we feel duty bound to buy the bonds that finance it. What's actually happening is that … the economy's been hit by a colossal shock," Haldane said.
 "This is not 'helicopter drops' (of cash), this is simply fiscal and monetary policy acting in tandem to tackle what is a whopper of a crisis." (Reporting by David Milliken and Andy Bruce Editing by Mark Heinrich)

“That was definitely a part of it, but it wasn't the main reason. We weren’t very good, but that wasn’t the main focus why I transferred. It was another aspect to add to it,” Hargis said without detailing the reason.
 St. Francis finished 22-10 (13-5 Northeast Conference) and advanced to the league tournament championship under eighth-year coach Rob Krimmel.
 Hargis has not had the opportunity to meet the coaching staff face to face due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But he has talked to them via Zoom meetings.
 “I like everyone on the coaching staff so far,” Hargis said. “They are very welcoming and seem very excited to have me. All the players contacted me and let me know they are excited for me to join the team and the school. It seems very family-oriented. I’m pretty excited for that.”
 Hargis will be at St. Francis for two years.
 “They talked about the culture of hard work,” Hargis said. “I think with the pieces they have on the team already, I think adding me can be very helpful, and it can help my game. It’ll help me, and I think I can help their system as well.”
 With the Hermits, he averaged 19.1 points and 6.2 rebounds per game as a senior. Hargis led the Hermits to their fourth straight Cape-Atlantic League American Division title and was named a first-team Press All-Star.
 He also led St. Augustine to the South Jersey Non-Public A title as a sophomore and junior. Hargis and Hermits captured the state Non-Public A title in 2016.
 He finished his scholastic career with more than 1,000 career points.
 “He was a very good scorer, a very good player,” Rodio said. “He was a team kid. I thought he contributed to what we were trying to do as a group.
 “When he signed at a Division I school like Holy Cross, I thought that level would be good for him. He practiced very similar to that level. So I think he will be successful (with St. Francis).”

SAN FRANCISCO -- Google said on Tuesday it would stop charging merchants to place products on its Google Shopping search page as it looks to win e-commerce advertising business from Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers, just as they are struggling to supply customers with some items due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 The move is the latest effort by Google to reinvigorate its Shopping service, which has been largely eclipsed by Amazon.com, where most online shoppers now start searches for products and merchants pay to feature prominently.
 Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has up to now charged merchants whose products appear when users click on the Shopping tab on Google's search engine. Amazon, which charges merchants only to promote items high on searches but takes a cut of their sales, is increasingly eating into that business.
 By adopting a system akin to Amazon's, Google is hoping more merchants will put their products on its service, which will attract more shoppers and ultimately increase ad revenue as merchants vie to be featured.
 "If you work with the ecosystem, there will be monetization opportunities that come on top of that," Google's president of commerce Bill Ready told Reuters in an interview.
 The new policy had been in the works for some time, Ready said, but was brought forward as some stores struggle to find buyers because of the virus. Some merchants said they lost sales during the outbreak when Amazon.com stopped offering fast shipping on some products so it could prioritize what it called essential items.
 Google's plan will take effect next week in the United States and by the end of the year globally.
 The move is a gamble for Google, as it may lead to a short-term loss of advertising revenue and does not guarantee an influx of new customers.
 'AMAZON COMPETE'
 Google executives have debated for months how best to push back against Amazon.com, rejecting the idea of spending billions of dollars to revamp the Google Shopping service, according to previously unreported accounts from 12 current and former high-ranking staff.
 Staffers last year explored partnerships with delivery companies to match Amazon's speedy shipping, but did not get the go-ahead from top executives to strike a deal, one source said.
 Amazon has invested heavily in stocking warehouses and delivery drivers at the expense of its gross profit margins, which stand at about 40 cents on every dollar of revenue, according to Refinitiv data.
 Google, which has no experience of such a physically intensive delivery operation, balked at a similar type of investment, which would cut its profit margins of about 60 cents per dollar of revenue, three sources said.
 "It's daunting the amount of capital and expertise it would take to run such a business, and even if you're successful, are you just going to be No. 2?" said Jon Venverloh, who left Google last summer after 18 years, including some time as a director on Shopping.
 Google declined to comment beyond Tuesday's announcement.
 Amazon's tenfold surge in online ad sales over the last five years to 4% of the global market compared to Google's 32% has created what some financial analysts call Google's greatest-ever threat.
 As Google leadership planned 2020 budgets last summer, some managers who oversee ad buying and selling software called for a coordinated plan to beat back Amazon on several fronts.
 They used presentations entitled 'Amazon Compete' from Google sales chief Philipp Schindler's strategy team that tracked the online retailer's growing power, including consumers' preference for its shopping search tools, three sources said.
 The name recalled an effort dubbed 'Facebook Compete' that led to big investments when Facebook Inc's mobile ads business surpassed Google's several years ago, five sources said. The project succeeded, with new ad formats and algorithms for mobile putting Google back on top.
 But Google executives did not feel the same pressure to invest heavily to beat back Amazon, said Sreekant Lanka, a Google ads executive until a year ago, despite Amazon's aggressive hiring, acquisitions and sales efforts.
 In 2019, Google had its worst sales growth in four years, but still added $18 billion in ad revenue, compared with an estimated $4 billion bump for Amazon.com to about $12 billion.
 Google's steady ad sales growth as more spending moves online has enabled top executives to justify limited investments in shopping, sources said.
 BUY ON GOOGLE
 Google also gets a cut of the purchase price when customers use the Buy on Google feature available on some products on Google Shopping, which lets people buy items using a credit card on file with Google without leaving the search engine.
 Merchants benefit because shoppers are more likely to buy the fewer clicks they have to make. Google gets a cut of sales and details on consumer purchases for ad targeting, while still avoiding fulfillment.
 But some stores are not sold. Jeff Cayley, CEO of bicycle retailer Worldwide Cyclery, said he pays Google on average 11 percent of sales for search ads taking shoppers to his website, compared with 15 percent when they purchase through Buy on Google.
 "It seems like a way (for Google) to dabble in marketplaces, but it's an uphill battle and a confusing experience for consumers," Cayley said.
 Google signed up about 4,000 merchants for Buy on Google by the end of the last year, behind its targets despite temporarily discounting its cut on product purchases by about 20%, according to two of the sources.
 While top executives last year initially prioritized big subsidies to attract shoppers, they later backtracked and even froze hiring in some areas to cut costs, according to three sources.
 Last month, Google again suspended promotions and marketing plans because of concerns related to the new coronavirus.
 Ben Frederick said he listed his Dr. Frederick's Original foot-health products through Buy on Google in mid-March when Amazon's delivery times lengthened. But he said just three Google orders had trickled in by last week.
