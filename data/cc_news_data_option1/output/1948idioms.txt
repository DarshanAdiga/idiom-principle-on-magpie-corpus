Furthermore, prices may also seek support from weakness in the dollar. The Dollar index slumped more than 0.7 percent yesterday and trades little changed today on the back of easing safe-haven demand and the growing expectation of more easing by the US Fed. The gains may, however, be capped amid lingering worries over global economic health along with renewed tensions between US- China. The recent deluge of bleak data from major economies like the US and Euro Zone highlights the extent of economic damage due to virus outbreak which in turn is fanning demand worries.

At the same time, it’s over the top for critics to say that Sasse’s comments about China are racist. His views of that country’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak are a legitimate part of our political discussion.)
 Third, Fremont High is Sasse’s alma mater. The video will be part of the permanent record. It’s a memento of enormous value to graduates and families, especially since the coronavirus deprived them of an in-person ceremony. Sasse had a responsibility to show respect by showing up looking like an adult. Instead, unshaven, tie askew, he looked like a “Saturday Night Live” parody of himself.
 The senator’s self-indulgent performance fell far short of what the graduates and their families deserved, taking focus off the students at what should have been a time for celebration.

Rhode Islanders are likely to notice more coyotes in the coming weeks, according to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, which is offering tips on avoiding conflicts.
 "Rhode Island's coyotes are on the move again," the DEM says a press release.
 Coyotes pups, usually 4 to 8 in a litter, are typically born in April and that keeps family packs moving.
 "Noisy, hungry pups must be fed," the DEM says. "That means adult coyotes will be seen and heard foraging and hunting for food in rural, suburban, and even urban Rhode Island neighborhoods over the next several months.
 "As daylight hours increase, adult coyotes may spend more time actively foraging during daytime than they would at other times of the year," the DEM says.
 The best way for humans to avoid conflicts is to reduce food sources around their homes, according to the DEM.
 "If you see coyotes that are bold and brazen, it's often directly related to intentional feeding or easy and reliably available food sources associated with human activities," DEM wildlife biologist Charles Brown said. "Intentionally feeding wild animals habituates them, causes them to lose their inherent fear of humans, and may lead to brazen behavior.
 "It also leads to a whole series of problems, including frequenting areas close to homes and preying on domestic animals such as chickens, cats, and small dogs," he said.
 He said most coyotes will avoid interactions with humans and attacks on humans are rare.
 Coyotes have made it into every Rhode Island community except Block Island, according to the DEM.
 Here are some tips from the DEM:
 Remove food and water sources from your yard, such as pet food dishes and bird feeders. Keep your barbecue grill clean of grease and don't put meat or sweet food scraps in your compost pile.
 Cut back brushy edges and dense weeds from around your yard and structures like sheds. The areas provide cover for coyotes and their prey.
 Scare coyotes off your property. Keep them wild by "hazing" them.
 To protect pets, keep them indoors. "Coyotes don't distinguish between domestic and wild animals and are likely to view cats and small dogs as potential food and larger dogs as competition," the DEM says.
 When confronted by a coyote. Stand up and look big. Wave your arms. Yell loudly. If the coyote does not retreat, walk slowly away toward the house. Do not turn your back on the animal.
 Coyotes that act aggressively or appear sick should be reported to the DEM Division of Law Enforcement (222-3070) or to your local animal control officer, the DEM said.
