“For us, we’re carrying over 100 players 9 through 12 (grades), so we’re wanting to put those athletes in the best equipment money can buy, and we’re going to have to maybe go out and get creative with getting some funding for us next season.”
 It's a frustrating situation for Serpas.
 “I’m definitely surprised because you’ve got the aspect of ‘hey, we hit Phase 3’, and now the governor says it’s OK to put 75 percent of the people on an enclosed bus, which if you look at the official capacity of a school bus, it’s like 70-something people,” Serpas said. “So they’re saying they can put 50 people on one school bus, but if you’re an outdoor stadium area, you can only put 25 percent in there. Honestly, I think the decision-making at that process is questionable from my opinion. I just don’t understand how they can come up with those numbers, those conclusions, because it just doesn’t add up.”
 Serpas said Springfield is also looking at possibly bringing in temporary bleachers in an effort to increase the stadium’s capacity.
 “We’re looking at it and trying to see what we can do to try to get those numbers up because honestly, we have the smallest stadium in our parish, so obviously our number is a lot lower than everybody else, and we’re in a situation where we don’t have a whole lot of bleacher space, but we do have a lot of standing room, and the standing room isn’t taken into account on our capacity number, so we’re trying to see if we can get some of that standing room to be calculated in there to help us out number-wise because of that,” Serpas said.
 Serpas is also hopeful stadium capacity limits will go up before the Bulldogs’ first home game against South Plaquemines on Oct. 16.
 “Really, nothing’s out of the question now,” Serpas said. “It’s just trying to abide by the rules. We don’t have a home game for quite a few weeks. Hopefully by the time we have to host a home game, we will possibly be at that 50 percent capacity at least, which will help boost our numbers up.”
 Beard is also hoping the stadium capacities go up as the season progresses.
 “I’m hoping that does change to give more people an opportunity to get back to normal and come watch a little football and get out of the house if they’re comfortable enough to make that choice,” he said. “I think all those things are being addressed or talked about. I understand where they came up with the 25 percent because that’s what they put on LSU, but at LSU, that’s still 25,000 people – a little different animal than a high school venue being outdoors and everything else. Once again, I’m going to support and back the decisions made by the people in the higher-up positions that make these calls. As long as our kids are able to play this game and play together and get back to somewhat normal times and experiences in their lives, that’s what we want.”
 Mahaffey and Westmoreland said fans can help by purchasing season tickets.
 “One thing we’re going to try and really push is the season tickets, and that way obviously it’s good for us to lock in some revenue, but at the same time, parents or whoever wants to come to the game, they can guarantee themselves a seat before we sell out of those, because we could be limited on how many people we can let in,” Mahaffey said.
 “We’re hinging on basically selling out the 25 percent and having a sell out at 25 percent,” Westmoreland said. “That will definitely help us. For season tickets, that will be great, so hopefully our fans will go ahead and purchase those season tickets, and that will definitely give us a better gauge of what we can and can’t do moving forward.”
 Livingston Parish Public Schools athletic director Steve Parrill stressed fans should reach out to their schools in order to purchase presale tickets because they’ll be at a premium with attendance limits in place.
 “We don’t want any one to come to a game and not be able to get in the door, and that’s why it’s important to contact the school for presale tickets,” he said.
 Beard said his main concern is giving his team an opportunity to play.
 “At the end of the day, can you really put a price tag on these kids’ opportunity to play this game for our school? We’re going to have to figure out a way to suck it up and hit the ground and maybe get a little more of the community involved to help us,” Beard said. “We’ll do whatever we have to do and get all the help we need and get everybody involved that needs to be involved to make sure these kids have the closest thing to a normal football season that we can give them, because we owe these kids that.”
 Janis agreed.
 “We’re very excited to play football,” Janis said. “The kids are excited to play football. The kids don’t care about the finances. That’s my job. That’s our administration’s job. We’ll look at those things, but everybody is excited to get back to playing football. We’ll worry about the other things when the time comes for that.”

Many of these reports suggest that if such a deal happens Liverpool will have a buy-back clause in the deal and that's something I would certainly like to see as there's no doubt the lad is a goalscorer.      If he's not going to get games at Liverpool in the foreseeable future having seemingly now moved further down the pecking order, you can't blame him for wanting to move on.      It would be shrewd to have a buy-back option though because Liverpool are then covering themselves with a kind of insurance policy, having put years worth of training and development into the boy.      He seems to have a good attitude and really comes alive in the box, perhaps the one area of his game which is lacking is that he doesn't do enough outside the box which may be down to the way we play.      He's a bit similar to myself in that I didn't really get involved in too much outside the box whereas Rushie was more involved in the build-up play.      That might be why they've looked to the likes of Jota who can maybe replicate Firmino's link play better but these are aspects of Brewster's game that can develop should he move on.

There are two dangers here. The first involves character assassination and its effects in business, elections and ordinary life. If high-level officials are using that strategy, and if it is working, others will do the same thing. Social norms can unravel in a hurry.
 Ugliness feeds on itself. Trump has been unleashing a lot of it, with devastating effects on individuals and institutions.
 The second danger involves the risks of literal violence. If people are described as crooked or crazy, as criminals or as traitors, or as guilty of sedition, they become dehumanized, and they are more likely to be hurt.

District 6 and 7 challengers Tim Hicks and Rebecca Alexander won their respective primaries against Van Huss and Hill in August. Hicks will now square off against Democrat Brad Batt in November, and Alexander, who won by a 26-point margin against Hill, won’t face an opponent.
 During a press availability ahead of a meeting with local officials, a roundtable that included Washington County Mayor Joe Grandy, Johnson City Mayor Jenny Brock and City Manager Pete Peterson, Sexton said he expects criminal justice reform, education and health care to be priorities in the upcoming legislative session. The prime objective will be passing a fiscally conservative budget.
 “What you’ve seen across our state in some cities and in other states across America is they’ve mismanaged the last decade and so they’ve had to raise taxes,” Sexton said. “In our state we have a different philosophy. We managed the last 10 years very well, and we’ve actually cut taxes and downgraded revenue growth and we’re able to maintain and continue what we’re doing as we come out of this.”
 Additionally, Sexton and Lt. Gov. Randy McNally have put together an ad hoc committee that is reviewing the emergency powers of the governor. That group will have another meeting in December.
 “It’s not so much to curtail what Gov. (Bill) Lee is doing,” Sexton said Monday. “We think he’s done a fantastic job in how he’s handled the pandemic, working with the local governments and local education associations.”
 According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, some Republicans have expressed concern about an executive order Lee issued early during the pandemic requiring Tennesseans to remain at home except under certain circumstances and orders that shut down state certain businesses for several weeks.
 Looking at the statute, Sexton said the degree of power held by the governor during emergencies has given him and other legislators pause. He said such power could be detrimental in the wrong hands.
 Sexton said legislators are looking at how other states handle executive power to give the governor flexibility but also provide oversight. As an example, Sexton said that could include allowing executive orders for a certain number of days, which would then require consideration from the General Assembly for an extension.
 Asked for his thoughts on an effort to remove a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, from the State Capitol, Sexton said he’s hesitant to remove history — good, bad or ugly.
 The Tennessean reported last week that Sexton and McNally believe the Tennessee Historical Commission can’t vote on removing the statue until the State Building Commission has a say in the matter.
 The State Capitol Commission had previously voted to remove the bust during a meeting in July, and the Historical Commission was slated to consider the move in October.
 “We’re going to have those conversations, and I think most Tennesseans agree with that approach,” he said. “I think as we continue to move forward, we’re going to follow the process and see what happens. We just want to make sure it’s followed from the beginning to end.”

After serving loyal customers at Taranta, their North End establishment for more than 20 years, Jose and Anna Duarte were recently forced to shut down the Italian and Peruvian restaurant, which was a wedding gift they bought for themselves in 2000.
 With the closure, the couple joined thousands of other Massachusetts restaurateurs forced to shut down their establishments because of the crippling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Duartes also own two other restaurants, including Trattoria San Pietro in Norwell, which has survived the shutdown and reopening of restaurants. So far.
 With colder weather sweeping into the region, restaurants throughout the South Shore that rely on safer, outdoor dining are being forced to adapt. Some are ramping up their takeout processes, and others are trying to make outdoor patio space permanent, or at least more usable in the fall. Some restaurant owners are confident they will make it through the cold season, and others are wary of the unknowns that lie ahead.
 Greg McDonald, owner of Common Market Restaurant Group in Quincy, said that while his customers largely prefer to sit outdoors, they might think differently when it starts to get cold. McDonald said he is getting heaters and adding wind-blocking side panels to the outdoor tent for October and November.
 "It's going to be a big deal for our industry to find out if people are comfortable coming indoors," he said.
 Anna Duarte said adapting to COVID restrictions is draining the bank accounts of some restaurants. She pointed to an umbrella sticking out of one of the outdoor tables at Trattoria, and said it cost $500. The couple hope to add panels indoors to separate the tables, but they have to consider the cost. Anna Duarte said she does not want to put in shower curtains, as some other restaurants are doing.
 "Every little thing that you do has a dollar sign attached to it," Duarte said.
 The Duartes are adding heaters next to their outdoor tables, but after he spent about $250 on six heaters through Amazon three weeks ago, Jose Duarte said he checked back a week later to buy more and they were gone. The resellers were selling them for $700, he said.
 Jose Duarte said a large component of a restaurant's ultimate survival is whether a landlord can be flexible about late rent payments and creative about space.
 Trattoria San Pietro in Norwell is on land shared with a pottery shop and a garden center, which is overflowing with mums and other greenery outside the store. Anna Duarte said the owners of those stores, as well as their landlord, allowed them to set up tables and chairs around the walking space in between the shops to expand their outdoor dining capacity.
 On Sept. 10, Gov. Charlie Baker announced that the Shared Streets and Spaces grant program would be extended from $5 million to $10 million, which will further help cities and towns set aside space on sidewalks for socially distanced dining, among other activities.
 While some restaurant owners are pushing to make outdoor dining last through the winter, others hope that increased takeout sales will make up for any loss of in-person diners.
 Julie Paige Milesky, owner of Skillet Cafe in Weymouth, said she initially extended the patio to increase outdoor seating by building more tables with tops that are easier to sanitize. She is putting heaters outside and focusing on perfecting the takeout experience.
 "Takeout has tried to take off," Paige Milesky said. "We cater to it more than we did prior to COVID. We just kind of stepped it up a little bit, the way we're doing it, just our process - getting everything out, getting everybody's food hot, keeping it hot. We bought all these different coolers to put your food in. The second it's made, it's bagged up."
 Paige Milesky said she plans to keep the patio open until mid-November, depending on the weather.
 "I think making our customers very aware of our plan and how we do things is going to be key to surviving," she said.
 According to the Massachusetts Restaurant Association, 20 percent of Massachusetts restaurants have closed because of the pandemic.
 On the South Shore, that list includes Riva, a fixture in Scituate Harbor for more than 20 years, and Hingham Beer Works, which served up burgers and beer at the Shipyard for a decade.
 Local restaurants often help their communities by donating gift cards to causes and venues for events, but the industry now needs support from those communities, said Jeffrey Gates, chairman of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association board of directors.
 There has been a push by lawmakers and residents to support local restaurants, but Gates said bars, nightclubs, catering businesses and event venues have largely been left behind.
 "We find ourselves in the industry in a very odd position where we need help, and the community has been very strong," Gates said. "The community support's been great. And the support from government has been pretty strong as well, but we do need more. We need grants. Our industry needs grants this winter to get through to April, for sure."

BRAINTREE -- Last-minute changes and preparations had school staff scrambling through the weekend before Monday's first day of in-person classes, the school committee was told.
 During Monday night's meeting, School Superintendent Frank Hackett commended administrators, teachers and other staff for their efforts in making the final preparations for the return of students after more six months outside the classrooms due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Hackett called it "an extraordinary effort from a lot of people."
 While schools opened on Wednesday, Monday was the first day of in-person classes for one group of students in Grades PK-8. The other group will have their first in-person classes on Thursday, and students at Braintree High School aren't scheduled to have their first in-person class until Oct. 13. The hybrid plan being used in the school system calls for students to attend in- person classes two mornings a week, with the rest of the time spent in remote classes.
 Added Assistant School Superintendent Jim Lee, "it has been a long time, but everyone wanted to get back."
 Lee said that among the last minute changes school officials had to deal with was a number of parents choosing full remote classes for their children.
 Hollis Elementary School Principal Timothy MacDonald praised the teachers who have taken on the challenge of full remote instruction.
 "Elementary teachers really want to be in front of their students," MacDonald said.
 He said administrators have received many complements in the first days of school from parents, saying the quality of the current remote classes are much higher than those last spring, MacDonald credited this to the work done by teachers and administrators during the summer to develop the program.
 Another benefit has been the small class sizes for the in-person classes, which have been limited due to social distancing requirements. MacDonald said the in-person classes have between five and ten students.
 Hackett said the first in-person day was a success.
 "Things went as well as we could have hoped," the superintendent said.
 Among the things being worked on is expanding school bus service to include students who face hazardous routes walking to school, Hackett said.
 Monday was also the first day for Grade 5 students to attend the renovated and expanded East Middle School.

“We were expecting one thing and given something else that just came completely out of left field that nobody expected,” Albany coach Mike Janis said. “It’s really kind of changed the way we’re looking at preparing for the season from a financial standpoint.”
 Janis said the school will likely be taking a look at ways to add to its standing room only numbers in an effort to try and increase the crowd size.
 “When you have such limited availability for people in the stadiums, unfortunately, we’re probably going to have to raise our ticket prices to make up for the lost revenue, especially our rivalry game kicking off with Springfield,” Janis said. “That’s a game where we expect full capacity in the stadium, and we would normally make quite a bit more money than we stand to make now with only 25 percent capacity. Financially, it’s not going to be easy for us, and there are some measures that we’re going to have to take to make up for that at the expense of the fans, unfortunately.”
 Denham Springs coach Brett Beard said capacity for Yellow Jacket Stadium is around 5,000, but he said there aren’t plans for adding extra seating.
 “If anything, we’re going to figure out a way to get the band maybe down in the end zone to where it doesn’t count against the capacity of the stadium itself,” he said. “Maybe looking at coaches’ families and stuff, kind of getting them out of the bleachers as well and put in a spot to where it doesn’t go against the opportunity for kids, parents and family to come watch.”
 Live Oak coach Blane Westmoreland, who said Eagle Stadium’s capacity is around 4,000, said the school will have to get creative with the way it seats fans and band.
 “With the 25 percent, we’re going to have to utilize our entire stadium, and we’re going to have certain seats available for our student section,” he said. “Obviously, our band is going to move to socially distance. They’re going to move out of the stadium and move into a socially-distanced area there. For our student section, we’re going to have certain areas marked off and space those guys out in the stadium for them, and then our general seating itself, we’re going to have that kind of spaced as well, but we’re going allow those families that are in the same home to sit together. Like I said before, it’s going to be a new normal, but we’re going to utilize every space of Eagle Stadium to put all the people that we can in here and get 25 percent.
 Meanwhile, Walker coach Chad Mahaffey said the capacity of Wildcat Stadium is around 4,000, meaning crowds will be around 1,000 for games.
 “First and foremost, I think everybody, if you say can you play or not play, no matter if any fans are in the stands, you’d choose to play,” Mahaffey said. “That’s what’s best for the kids and the teams, but for parents and for the financial part for the schools, the more people that they put in, the more it’s going to help those schools with the financial part of it.”
 The Wildcats have seven home games this season, including a scrimmage against Catholic High on Friday.
 “I think our number, as long as we’re able to get that many people in the stadium, it will be better for us, but I can certainly see that being a problem,” Mahaffey said of revenue issues. “Officials may cost you three, four or five hundred dollars, and security and some of those things. It can be tough. It’s definitely not the best situation financially for the schools to have to limit it that much.”
 That’s exactly the situation for Springfield football coach and athletic director Ryan Serpas, who said the capacity of the Bulldogs’ stadium is just under 300.
 “We’re in a situation where generally with my football program, I know that we generally turn a profit off of our gate and concession stand,” Serpas said. “Well, it’s just going to be a situation where we’re going to have to try to tread water as a program and see what we can do, and (we) might have to do a couple of extra fundraisers throughout the year just to stay in the green.”
 “You hate to go up on your prices, but it might be something where we’re looking at that, and also in the past, we’ve given discounts to students and to senior citizens, and that’s something else that we’re possibly going to have to take away as well,” Serpas continued. “You hate to have to do that, but you still have to be able to pay the bills, and people don’t account for whether we play at Walker High School … or you play at Springfield … the price for the officials is going to be the same. We’ve got to be able to figure out a way to pay the bills, not necessarily to make a profit, but just to be able to survive.”
 Westmoreland said that will be a common factor for football programs this season.
 “It’s going to be tough,” Westmoreland said. “It’s going to be tough for all schools that have chosen to play football this season. One of the best things about our community is this community will support us day-in and day-out. What I feel like, we’re going to fill our 25 percent capacity up, but we’re still going to fall short of where our normal Friday night gates are, so we’re going to have to get creative to make that up going into next season.

BROCKTON -- A patient comes into the doctor's office or hospital with a fever, shortness of breath and muscle pain. In past years, seasonal influenza may have been the likely cause. Come fall, it may be harder to know.
 The city's hospitals are preparing for flu season to collide with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Through testing for both of the viruses, staff will be able to determine how to best help patients.
 "The symptoms of the flu are very, very similar to COVID-19, which is going to make discriminating against the two difficult," said Stacey Ryan, infection control manager of Signature Healthcare Brockton Hospital.
 Influenza and COVID-19 are both infectious diseases, but they are caused by different viruses. It's possible to have both at the same time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 They are spread similarly through respiratory droplets and secretions, which can be minimized by wearing a face mask, covering coughs, hand-washing and wiping down surfaces.
 There is a "whole spectrum" of how COVID-19 and the flu affect the body, said Dr. Kenneth Lawson, chief medical officer of Good Samaritan Medical Center.
 The vast majority who have either will have mild symptoms and be able to recover. Both can kill and affect the elderly and those with preexisting health conditions more severely, he said.
 If a person's symptoms worsen and can't be managed at home, they should call their doctor and may need to seek hospital care, Lawson said.
 "I'd rather have people be overly cautious up front," Lawson said.
 For someone admitted for care, health care staff provide mostly symptomatic care, like keeping a patient hydrated or keeping a fever down, he said.
 Lawson said there is some antiviral therapy that helps with flu and some promising medications or antibodies for COVID-19 that will hopefully be released in the coming months.
 For the flu, treatment should begin within at least three days after symptoms start, Ryan said.
 During last year's flu season, hundreds were tested at Brockton Hospital and Good Samaritan. Between 15 and 20 percent of those tests came back positive.
 Of the 100 positive patients at Good Samaritan's emergency department, 11 people were admitted for treatment.
 This season, testing for the flu and COVID-19 will go on at doctors offices or at the hospitals.
 The time frames to receive test results back may be different this year, Lawson said. There is expected to be some wait with COVID-19 results, he said.
 Another way to help determine whether people have the flu or COVID-19 is through screening.
 For outpatient care, Ryan said the plan is to ask people about their symptoms over the phone to determine if they need to be seen in-person or if they can see a doctor through teleconferencing.
 Similar to how the hospitals set aside space to treat COVID-19 patients, they will have isolation rooms to see patients with potential flu symptoms.
 A lot of the practices that the hospitals have in place to handle infectious diseases like flu and COVID-19 will continue, Lawson said.
 "It will work for the flu, it will work with the common cold, it will work with COVID," he said.
 During previous flu seasons, the hospital would put out signs with information about the flu, including hand-washing, covering coughs and wearing face masks.
 "This year the entire world has been trained on this and knows it intuitively," Lawson said.
 The flu usually starts spreading in mid-to-late fall, is more widespread in the winter and slows down in the spring, according to the CDC.
 Its onset varies. Last year's flu season started about three weeks earlier than the previous year.
 Flu season typically starts in other parts of the world, like Australia and the Southern Hemisphere, and other parts of the country, like the West, before arriving on the East Coast. That gives doctors in Massachusetts some warning or an idea of what kind of flu season they will face.
 Ryan said the hospital will monitor flu and COVID-19 rates in the community to hopefully know in advance if there is going to be another surge of patients.
 In the past several months there haven't been as many public gatherings and people being together in tight places, which is how the flu typically spreads. Those situations have been reduced since the coronavirus pandemic.
 Most people are wearing masks, Ryan said, which might minimize people affected during this flu season.
 It's important to continue to wear masks when in public or when social distancing isn't possible, she said.
 Hospital leaders and state leaders are recommending flu shots.
 On Thursday, Gov. Charlie Baker and state health officials received flu shots at a Roslindale CVS. They encouraged people to get a flu shot to protect not only to protect against seasonal virus and but also to avoid overburdening the health system with flu and COVID-19.
 "Having the flu and COVID-19 surge in the commonwealth at exactly the same time would be an incredibly difficult situation for them to manage their way through," he said about conversations from the health care community. "They urged us to step up our game, which is already pretty good relative to states in the country, on flu vaccines."
 Flu shots are recommended for people six months and older, according to the CDC. People should aim to get them in September or October.
 Ryan said the shot is safe and it can help people have a less severe case of the flu and avoid hospitalization.
 Flu shots will be available through Steward and Signature primary care doctors at their offices. People can also go to a pharmacy clinic, like CVS or Walgreens.
 People will be safe wearing a regular mask when they go out to get their flu shots, Lawson said.
 "Ensuring that people continue or start getting routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for protecting people and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases and outbreaks, including flu," the CDC says on its website.

Well, first off Boyd has skin in the game already. He spent over $6 million for the property. He proposes $142 million in private investment in condos, businesses and apartments surrounding the field. He has already paid for the architectural specs to ensure the proposal fits. He also has a baseball team to put in the stadium, something it is very hard to achieve given Major League Baseball’s cutbacks on farm teams.
