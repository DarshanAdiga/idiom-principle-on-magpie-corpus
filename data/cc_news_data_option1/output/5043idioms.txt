In light of the worldwide pandemic, many people, including WWE Superstars, had to rewire their minds and bodies from being on the road all year long to being close to home more. For Apollo Crews, he says this year gave him more time to spend with his two children and his fiance. He said the biggest takeaway was staying home with his children and facing the hardship that comes from being a full-time stay at home parent.
 "One thing this whole pandemic kind of helped me learn was that I had some growing up to do. I changed as a human being, and I feel like I became more of a man," Apollo Crews openly admitted in his _Chasing Glory_ interview. "I grew a lot of patience. When this first started, I was very impatient. I was like, 'Man, I can't deal with this. I need to just go back on the road.' And that was something that was gone: me having my time. But then I realized, this is what she's been going through this whole time.
 "I give mothers the most amount of respect, especially a single mother. Man, women have a hard job as mothers. I have so much respect for any mother out there who's raising kids because it's a tough job. I [also] have respect for single fathers because it's a tough job. I still don't know what I'm doing, but I just go with the flow."

He mentions that his three-year-old daughter is quite a fan of the former seven-time WWE 24/7 Champion and longtime friend to Crews, Akira Tozawa.
 "She loves Tozawa," he said with a big smile. "He came over recently, and he hasn't seen her in a while, and he's like, 'Man, she talks so much now!' I'm like, 'She does!'"
 He admits that once travel restrictions are lifted, he says it's going to be hard for him to go back on the road following all this time he's had a home with his family.
 "It'll be hard," he admitted. "I mean, my kids get so excited [when I come back home], but it'll be tough."
 Looking ahead, Crews is looking to have another big breakout moment like he did this summer when he won the WWE United States Championship. He mentions that it doesn't matter which brand he goes to he just wants to be part of the fun and productivity, something he knows he has to work on in the future.
 "I feel like no matter where I'm at, as long as something productive is happening, it doesn't really matter what I am," he stated. "I love _Raw_. I love _SmackDown_. Each show has different things, but wherever I go, I just want to be part of the show. I just want to be part of something special."
 One thing he knows will gravitate fans back towards his character is if he were to become a heel. While most know him to be a happy, easy-going, loveable babyface, he thinks becoming a methodical and well thought out heel might gain new or former fan's eyes on him again.
 "I would love to," he exclaimed. "I'm not one of them that would just destroy things; I'd want to be the more thought out one. I wouldn't be the guy who comes out throwing stuff. I like the thought out and methodical ones. My tone may change a little, but you'll know that 'Oh, man, this dude is serious.'"
 Crews concluded his interview with a cliffhanger on what he would like to do to get back to the top again in WWE.
 "I know that's what's holding me back at the end of the day," he said. "I actually have to do it instead of saying it. I feel like somewhere along the lines, I got too comfortable, and I kind of lost that drive. Winning the title actually put me back on track because I knew once I won the title, this isn't it...I won't say, I know, [but] I'll say I know what I have to do to get back there."

 # We need your help continuing to watch your back, build civic bonds
 Douglas Ray
 Ocala Star-Banner
 This year will be recalled as the year of the pandemic, but it’s also the year of the infodemic – a brokenness in our civic life brought on by untrustworthy information or simply a lack of trustworthy news.
 Across the nation, as more newspapers fold, more communities are losing an essential source of social cohesion. Local newspapers like the Ocala Star- Banner are feeling the pinch, caught between the larger forces that are convulsing our national political discourse and disrupting economic life, and also feeling the local impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the kitchen- table decisions that are forcing families to rethink their priorities.
 At a time when many of us are feeling more isolated and worried about the near-term future, good local journalism is important. We are committed to providing it. The Star-Banner newsroom is working hard but, for the time being, we’re doing that away from our offices.
 I have the distinct honor to oversee news operations at the Star-Banner, Gainesville Sun and Daily Commercial in Leesburg. We are connected to a large network of newspapers across Florida. Together, our coverage of COVID-19 and the crazy hurricane season has been without peer, as has our work on recent elections. Among newspapers, our capital team is the most robust in Florida. And consider the investigative journalism that has continued to roll out from our terrific editors and reporters. The Torn Apart series on child welfare (with additional chapters coming out this month) sparked immediate calls for new legislation.
 Communities without daily newspapers are often referred to as news deserts. These are places where no independent watchdogs are keeping their local officials accountable, spreading the word on events and community needs, and binding neighbors together with a shared narrative of what it means to live here.
 A study of news deserts by the University of North Carolina found that the loss of local newspapers can have an enormous impact on a community.
 “Our sense of community and our trust in democracy at all levels suffer when journalism is lost or diminished. In an age of fake news and divisive national politics, the fate of communities across the country, and of grassroots democracy itself, is linked – more than ever – to the vitality of local journalism,” researchers found. “Local newspapers have historically been a ‘tie that binds’ people in a community. Through the stories they publish, local newspapers help us ‘understand how we are related to people we may not know we are related to.’ They also educate us, providing us with information to guide important decisions that will affect the quality of our own lives, as well as those of future generations.”
 You may have friends who say they get their news from the social media. But credible posts on social media are often based on the work of professional journalists who have the skills, the time and the reputation for verifying what they are reporting. Too much of the division within our country and our community is rooted in untrustworthy social media posts.
 You can support local journalism in many ways. Speak up for the value of trustworthy reporting. Write a letter to the editor or a column on a local issue close to your heart. Buy the newspaper at a local store or subscribe, either to the print edition or to our digital publication.
 You care about this community and so do we. Together we can celebrate, inform and support a vibrant future.

PRATT -- Mike Lewis of Pratt Livestock thinks cattle prices are headed in a direction that will favor the producer.
   
 The year 2020 has been a difficult one for Kansas cattlemen, but there could be good news for the coming months. Lewis said last week that meatpacking plants have been under fire due to the vast difference in profit margins for ranchers versus packers.
   
 "It was really bad for a while. We were selling feeder cattle, 700-1000 pound steers, to the feed lots but we were losing money last summer," Lewis said. "The packers were actually making, for a short time, they were netting $800 a head."
   
 Lewis said he believes there is a cycle for prices as the demand and number of cattle being sold fluctuate. He said he also understands that packers are doing their jobs to make money for their stockholders.
   
 Sale prices are coming up at Pratt Livestock. Right now, there are two sale days per week at the facility east of Pratt along US 54/400 highway. From October through December, the sale barn has a sale on Thursday and another on either Monday or Saturday. Lewis said there are about 3,500 calves and feeder steers being sold each week at Pratt Livestock. A wide variety of cows are sold each week, and the market can be complex.
   
 Currently, steer calves that have been weaned and vaccinated are selling for about $1.50 to $1.90 per pound. Heifer calves can be about 15 cents less than that. According to Lewis, an 800-pound steer ready to go to the feedlot will sell for anywhere between $1.35 and $1.45.
   
 Lewis owned Pratt Livestock for about four decades before the Winter family bought the business six or seven years ago. Mike Lewis and his son Jake Lewis, along with Roger Panek, run the show at Pratt Livestock. Winter Livestock owns sale barns in Kansas, Pratt Livestock along with Dodge City. They also have sales in Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming.
