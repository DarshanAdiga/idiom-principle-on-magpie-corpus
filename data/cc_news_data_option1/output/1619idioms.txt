While on the run after the shooting, Muhammad learned that he was wanted for Williams’ killing. On the recording, Muhammad said that if he was “going down for murder” the best thing was to “kill as many white men” as he could.
 On April 18, 2017, Muhammad drove through downtown shooting at white men, he said. He surrendered to police after, at one point, firing nearly 20 shots in less than a minute, authorities said.
 Zachary Randalls, 34, was shot in a Pacific Gas & Electric truck.
 “When I walked up to the truck, I saw a Mexican driver and a white guy,” Muhammad said. “I didn’t want to target the driver because he was Mexican so I shot the white dude.”
 He also was convicted of killing Mark Gassett, 37, and David Jackson, 58, and trying to shoot three other men.
 Muhammad was convicted of first-degree murder for Jackson's slaying; second- degree murder for Williams, Randalls and Gassett; four counts of attempted murder; one count of shooting at an occupied vehicle and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

His predecessor Yousaf Naseem Khokhar had served as the chief secretary for thirteen months before he was moved to the federal government. Before that, Akbar Hussain Durrani, who was appointed by the caretaker government, remained in this office for four months.
 With Azam Suleman’s going out and Jawad Rafique Malik’s coming in, Punjab has got the fourth chief secretary in 20-month rule of the Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI). Jawad Rafique Malik was serving as the federal communications secretary presided over by Minister Murad Saeed before his shifting to Punjab.
 Azam Suleman has been changed amid the ongoing concerted campaign against COVID-19 pandemic he was leading from the front. His track record shows that he builds an excellent team work with his colleagues.
 His colleagues say he is reputed to be a hard task master and no nonsense type of officer, an approach that ended his incumbency as the Punjab chief secretary. He is known as an effective officer and a man of strong likes and dislikes.
 He rarely gets along well with politicians and would not allow them to mess around with his secretaries and field officers. He loathes political interference and pursues his own policies. But he was a favourite of former chief minister Shahbaz Sharif, who always posted him in the departments which he himself directly supervised because no minister or adviser felt comfortable with Azad Suleman.
 As the interior secretary, Azad Suleman is credited with ironing out key issues pertaining to the national visa policy and Kartarpur corridor. In a short span of time, he became one of those federal secretaries Prime Minister Imran Khan liked. He thus earned the assignment of the Punjab’s top man, which is considered most important bureaucratic position in the country.
 The prime minister had posted Azam Suleman after a high-profile announcement that the government has decided to transform Punjab and its administration. He had publicly declared that the new chief secretary and Inspector General of Police (IGP) will be given free hand and no undue political interference will be tolerated in their professional work.
 The new chief secretary and IGP had been brought to lead the Punjab administration amid reports of poor governance under the Usman Buzdar administration.
 Azam Suleman had been the longest serving home secretary in the Shahbaz Sharif administration, from 2013 to 2018. Prior to that, he had worked as the secretary of irrigation and communications and works and was credited with many development projects during that era.
 During the 2018 general elections, he was appointed the chief secretary of Sindh. The present government made him interior secretary since he had done well as the Punjab home secretary. Azam Suleman was inducted in the civil service from the army directly in grade 18 by Nawaz Sharif in 1991. At the time, he, as major, was working as the ADC to Lt-Gen Hameed Gul when the latter had headed the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).
 Officials privy to the development say that for the last few months it was not business as usual between Buzdar and Azam Suleman. They say that the chief minister and cabinet members felt marginalised because of Azam Suleman’s style of running the administration.
 According to these officials, Thursday’s meeting of Buzdar with the prime minister turned out to be decisive to change the chief secretary.
 They say that with Azam Suleman’s transfer, a message has been conveyed that Buzdar continues to be the man presiding over the Punjab with full powers and also kills the grapevine that the chief minister is on his way out. The prime minister has communicated to all and sundry that he is fully behind Waseem Ikram Plus.
 Azam Suleman, who has a year to go before he retires, is not known to remain in wilderness for long as a day after his transfer from Punjab, he was given the same position - interior secretary - from where he had been sent to the majority province.
 The chief secretary, who is the top bureaucrat in the province and is considered a representative of federal government in the province, is also the “cabinet secretary” for the provincial administration. He supervises 40 plus departments and all commissioners and deputy commissioners in Punjab.
 A Punjab government official told The News that Azam Suleman’s transfer and Jawad Rafique Malik’s nomination in his place was a normal development. “It is the government’s privilege to post and change bureaucrats to implement its agenda.”

SUKKUR: Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah is being victimised by the government through NAB that has failed to prove its charges against him. Praising his services, Bilawal said Khursheed has stood by with the PPP through thick and thin but the federal government even at this time of crisis is busy in victimising the opposition leadership. The PPP chairman was talking to Khursheed’s nephew, Sindh Transport Minister Syed Awais Qadir Shah on Thursday and discussed the rejection of the PPP leader’s bail by the SHC bench. The PPP chairman also asked the PPP minister about the sudden surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in Sukkur and advised him to ensure enforcement of lockdown during Friday prayers and Taraveeh so that the infection does not spread. He said he was in touch with the CM Murad Ali Shah over Covid-19. Bilawal criticised the PTI government saying that the party was unnecessarily politicising the management of the pandemic by Sindh which is not very helpful. He said the prime minister by campaigning against the lockdown is seriously undermining the efforts of the Sindh government and the advice of medical experts to bring the deadly virus under control.

The entire resort — restaurants, bars, lifts, ski shops and lodging — would be closed for a minimum of one week. They were being extremely optimistic at this point. As several members of our party had flown to the northeast, we were relegated to making the best of the circumstances and enjoying our solitude.
 My wife and I made a shopping list and drove the 30 minutes to the closest grocery store. As we perused the aisles, the one thing that paralleled our own supply chain back in West Virginia was the absence of paper products, namely toilet paper. Staying at a hotel, that wasn’t a concern that plagued our unique vacation. Fortunately, we left the market with enough items for five or more days.
 The next day, Sunday, can only be described as a mass exodus. The front desk was alive with people checking out one after another. The valet attendants hurriedly gathered owners’ cars and loaded their gear and luggage. By the end of the day, the 196-room resort had just over half a dozen occupied rooms.
 Strapping on snowshoes, we set out from the lodge, walking on the slopes that just a day before were crowded with enthusiasts carving turns back toward the base. The lifts sat idle, as they would each day after closing. The difference would be that they would not open again this season. It was like a veritable ghost town. With the exception of a few others seeking outdoor recreation, we had the entire mountain to ourselves in this surreal landscape.
 That evening, we made a trip to a neighboring community to unknowingly enjoy what would be our one and only dining experience outside of our hotel suite.
 By the second day, the only thing open on the entire mountain was the front desk of the hotel. Housekeeping had informed us the previous day they would no longer be making rounds and that any additional items could be retrieved from the front desk. A valet had retrieved our car and returned our keys. Since we were one of only a few guests, they parked our vehicle in the short-term spaces at the front of the hotel.
 This was to be a trip marked with adventure and excitement. Activities were arranged for all ages including skiing, snow tubing, spa visits and snowmobiling. With the closing of the resort, all of those plans disappeared in the blink of an eye. The indoor pool, spa, resort gym — all closed.
 On day three, only two rooms in the entire resort remained occupied. Though we never saw the other guests, I inquisitively asked the front desk each day how many residents roamed the sprawling resort. We procured a few sleds from a local hardware store, and our group of five had the entire snow tubing park to ourselves. The upside was that we didn’t have to wait in any lines. The downside was we had to walk back up the slope after each run.
 Unsure of what would happen with airline travel, our family that had flown to Albany opted to change their itinerary and return ahead of schedule. The morning we left to take them back to the airport, the front desk informed me that my wife and I would be the only guests in the entire resort when we returned.
 As we returned to our apocalyptic accommodations amid the pandemic, I strolled the empty halls. In all of my travels, I had never experienced such desolation. When returning from retrieving extra towels from the front desk, I would open the door slightly and announce, “Here’s Johnny!” My wife was less than amused.
 Over the remaining three days, we walked the empty grounds of the resort. Occasionally, we would spot a homeowner from the area walking in the distance. This was our only human contact aside from the lone front desk attendant that rotated out with each shift. I roamed the halls, though I didn’t spot any creepy twins or experience any other paranormal activity.
 I contemplated writing a novel as the situation and circumstances seemingly beckoned me to do so. I had this once-in-a-lifetime inspiration and an experience that only Stephen King could bring to life.
 For my fellow GenXers, we all remember where we were and what we were doing the day the Challenger exploded and when the World Trade Center collapsed. As the pandemic is a worldwide event, it will undoubtedly be remembered for generations to come.
 My experience in the vacant hotel in the Green Mountains of Vermont will always resonate as one of those memories. For now, I will look forward to next season, when I can, hopefully, return and enjoy the resort in a different light.
