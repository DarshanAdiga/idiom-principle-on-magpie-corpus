Eddie Van Halen wasn't just a guitar legend for his playing and songwriting – his tone will live on as timeless too. Eddie put his heart and soul into refining his sound and the late icon's collaboration with MXR on the EVH 5150 Overdrive pedal represents the most accessible way to recreate his incredible drive tones. No wonder it's been selling out online – and we haven't seen it reduced elsewhere either – but now you can get it with $40 off at Pro Audio Star while stocks last…

Entering Wednesday's season opener against Morehead State, there wasn't much buzz surrounding Cam'Ron Fletcher.
 The freshman wing from St. Louis made sure that would change after a thoroughly productive 12 minutes off the bench in the Wildcats' 81-45 win over the Eagles.
 Fletcher did a little bit of everything, scoring nine points on 4-of-5 shooting from the field, grabbing five rebounds, dishing out three assists, and recording a steal.
 "I love what I saw from Cam today because he just... plays... hard," Kentucky coach John Calipari said of the 6-foot-6 Fletcher.
 The UK boss said Fletcher had not shown that kind of well-rounded performance in the Cats' workouts leading up to the season. For that reason, he was one of the last scholarship players to enter the game.
 "But now, what he just did today, we're going to push him in there," Calipari said.
 It may have been easy for fans to overlook Fletcher, the lowest-rated member of Kentucky's latest No. 1 recruiting class. "Only" a four-star prospect, he was rated the No. 10 small forward prospect in the nation and the No. 49 prospect overall.
 In addition to his new freshman teammates, including five-star wings BJ Boston and Terrence Clarke, he was also overshadowed by UK signing three high-profile transfers in the off-season.
 “I don’t care about attention, for real," Fletcher said. "I just play hard and play dirty. That’s just me.”
 He got a ringing endorsement from Clarke after Wednesday's game. "Cam is that guy, man. He plays as hard as he can every time he's out there and he gives it his all. That's why I love him to death. That's one of my main guys on the team right now.
 "He went out there today and surprised a lot of people."
 “It was good," Fletcher said. "For the first game with my team, I just wanted to go out there and have fun. I wanted everyone else on the team to have fun. I just wanted to get the win."
 With an eye on building on his debut performance, Fletcher seems to know the quickest route to earning more playing time from Calipari.
 “Don’t worry about scoring or anything else," he said. "Just worry about fighting and everything else will fall into place. When you’re playing hard, stuff just falls in line.”

Under state criteria, houses of worship in red Covid-19 zones are limited to 10 people, and those in orange zones to 25. The case was brought against Gov. Cuomo by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, challenging those limits. The diocese argued that the restrictions violate the free exercise of religion provisions in the Constitution.
 The seven-page decision was issued “per curiam” — for the court — with no single justice’s name attached. The Court of Appeals has scheduled a full hearing for Dec. 18.
 “As noted, the State has not claimed that attendance at the applicants’ services has resulted in the spread of the disease,” the decision states. “And the State has not shown that public health would be imperiled if less restrictive measures were imposed.
 “Members of this Court are not public health experts, and we should respect the judgment of those with special expertise and responsibility in this area. But even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.”
 Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens said in a statement issued on Thanksgiving that he was looking forward to continuing the case in the Court of Appeals.
 “I am gratified by the decision of the Justices of the United States Supreme Court, who have recognized the clear First Amendment violation and urgent need for relief in this case,” DiMarzio said.
 “I am proud to be leading the Diocese of Brooklyn and fighting for our sacred and constitutional right to worship. I have said from the beginning the restrictions imposed by Governor Cuomo were an overreach that did not take into account the size of our churches or the safety protocols that have kept parishioners safe.”
 Gov. Cuomo, in comments made on Thanksgiving, was dismissive of the decision.
 “I think that Supreme Court ruling on the religious gatherings is more illustrative of the Supreme Court than anything else,” he said in a transcript obtained from his official website. “It’s irrelevant from a practical impact because the zone that they were talking about has already been moved. It expired last week. I think this was really just an opportunity for the Court to express its philosophy and politics ...”
 Cuomo added that he fully respects religion “and if there’s a time in life when we need it, the time is now, but we want to make sure we keep people safe at the same time.”
 Roberts and the other dissenting justices support Cuomo’s point that a ruling was not needed now as the churches and synagogues involved were no longer in red or orange zones. Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh issued unusually stinging rebukes of that argument in their concurring opinions.
 “At the same time, the Governor has chosen to impose no capacity restrictions on certain businesses he considers ‘essential,’” Gorsuch wrote, citing hardware stores, acupuncturists, liquor stores, bicycle repair shops, accountants, lawyers, and insurance agents.
 “So, at least according to the Governor, it may be unsafe to go to church, but it is always fine to pick up another bottle of wine, shop for a new bike, or spend the afternoon exploring your distal points and meridians,” Gorsuch continued. “Who knew public health would so perfectly align with secular convenience?”

NOLENSVILLE — The nearly 51/2-hour road trip to the middle of the state didn’t seem to bother the top-ranked Elizabethton football team in Friday night’s Class 4A semifinal against Nolensville.
 The top-ranked and defending state champion Cyclones thoroughly dominated the game, blowing by the Knights 56-21.
 Elizabethton ran its winning streak up to 29 games and will have a chance at a repeat state championship next weekend against Haywood at Tucker Stadium in Cookeville.
 “Our kids played with relentless effort today and we talk about mental toughness all the time,” Elizabethton coach Shawn Witten said. “To take this trip on the road, and we knew this year we’d have to come on the road to the semis. It doesn’t get any better than this and this is ultimately the toughest challenge we’ve had.”
 Parker Hughes — one of Elizabethton’s two Mr. Football finalists — had a standout game, rushing the ball 14 times for 191 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught three passes for 30 yards and a score.
 Bryson Rollins — the other part of the dynamic duo — had his usual efficient night, going 8-for-10 passing for 147 yards and two touchdowns. Also, he ran the ball seven times for 21 yards and two TDs.
 The Cyclones (14-0) outgained Nolensville 475-239 and scored on every possession. Elizabethton was 4-for-7 on third-down conversions and even better on fourth down, going 3-for-3.
 Hughes set the tone early with a 9-yard reception to the back of the end zone on the Cyclones’ opening possession on fourth-and-3.
 After Cade Russell picked off a Ryder Galardi pass at the 1, the Cyclones took the momentum for good.
 Hughes burst through the middle of the Nolensville line, breaking four tackles and taking it 85 yards all the way to put Elizabethton up three scores before Nolensville even got a sniff off the red zone.
 “The whole first half was just tremendous,” Witten said. “The ability to score when the ball is on the 1-yard line.”
 Nolensville quickly countered with a 10-play drive capped by a Galardi 26-yard tunnel screen pass to Parker Price that went for a score. Even though he was small in stature, Price was a huge weapon Friday night, piling up nine catches for 102 yards.
 Knights quarterback Galardi finished his evening 14-for-23 with 186 yards.
 Even though Nolensville had closed the gap, it left Elizabethton with 2:28 left in the half and that was plenty of time for Rollins to go to work.
 Rollins connected with Jake Roberts on an out route that Roberts took 65 yards to the house and gave Elizabethton a comfortable cushion (28-7) going into the break.
 Roberts ended his night with four catches and 111 yards.
 Nate Stephens got in on the action late for the Cyclones, racking up seven carries for 69 yards and two touchdowns.
 For Witten’s bunch, the pressure has mounted every week to play at a certain level. On Friday, the Cyclones showed what they can do when firing on all cylinders.
 “We’ve been saying it all along that we hadn’t seen our best football yet,” Witten said. “We’ve had halves and quarters, but strictly dominating the whole game, that’s what we did tonight.”

Long before Thanksgiving Days of the past, most of us had already decided where and with whom we would enjoy the day. In your early years, many of you were at your parents’ home and found yourself at the dinner table enjoying Thanksgiving Day with family members. Later, in your adult years, you may have enjoyed this special holiday with your spouse and children in your own home or perhaps the home of your parents or in-laws.
 Occasionally, Thanksgiving Day dinner was at a sibling’s or another relative’s home. As you think back over the years, you probably visualize 10, 15, 20 or more people enjoying Thanksgiving Day dinner together. But regardless of the home or venue where Thanksgiving Day dinner occurred or how many attended, the plans were known well in advance of this day. Not this year! Because of COVID-19, most of us concluded that this year’s Thanksgiving Day dinner would be at our homes with limited participation. Some of my friends and associates decided not to have their traditional Thanksgiving Day dinner because so many would be missing; some decided not to celebrate this day at all. A platter dropped off at one’s door was Thanksgiving dinner for many.
 Unfortunately, this Thanksgiving Day dinner, was not the special Thanksgiving of the past. Yet, it was Thanksgiving Day, a day that has always been special to Black families.
 I suspect that many of you, in the absence of the special Thanksgivings enjoyed in the past, reached back in time, and reflected on those distinct moments and yearn to experience such moments one more time. Members of my household gathered around the Thanksgiving Day dinner table and reflected on fond memories of Thanksgiving Day dinners back in the day and also expressed gratitude for our blessings. These fond memories of the past included special dishes that were a part of the meal, guests who attended and bits of conversations that took place at the dinner table.
 Some thoughts of what was missed this year are quite vivid — some more vivid then others. I can never forget my mother cutting up celery and mashing the yolk of boiled eggs to make her special stuffed celery. The preparation of homemade rolls and the baking of so many wonderful desserts made my mouth water. It seemed like magic but I now realize that it was my mother’s careful planning to make certain that the rolls were piping hot when we sat down for dinner. I thought about what was missing in my kitchen this year. What about your kitchen? Last year, we had dinner with my brother and other family members. It was a shared experience with various members bringing special dishes to make the meal complete with roast turkey and all of the trimmings. Although we had many of the traditional dishes this year, due to the virus, our dinner was a scaled down version of what we were accustomed to in the past. So, the homemade rolls were missing and there was no 15-pound turkey, but we did have homemade desserts. In fact, the homemade sweet potato cake was my contribution.
 Many of you can relate to my family’s experience on this Thanksgiving. In fact, I know of some families that purchased and prepared the “Hungry-Man Dinners,” a frozen meal purchased at the supermarket. The dining room is where we traditionally ate as a family, using our finest china on this special day.
 But this year, we gathered around the kitchen table. It was nothing was elaborate and it was kept simple. Clearly, the food on our Thanksgiving Day table was different because of restrictions and limitations related to food shopping, posed by COVID-19.
 Thanksgiving Day dinner and family are inseparable. Thanksgiving in the past was the one holiday where family members were expected to come together. No matter where you were, away at school, in the armed services, living in another town or city, you went home for Thanksgiving. Not this year. We experienced the absence of bonding with our family that was so special to Thanksgivings of the past.
 Not only were faces missing who had passed on, but the faces that usually were present for Thanksgiving Day dinners in the past were not present this year. They were not present because they honored social distancing, a critical factor in dealing with this horrendous pandemic.
 Some families were determined to experience the Thanksgiving Day dinners of the past and braved the weather and ate outside on their decks. For others, the only semblance of this year’s Thanksgiving Day dinner were the football games that followed. Some families used technology to come as close as possible to having Thanksgiving Day dinner with family as they had done in the past.
 The general counsel of The Tribune celebrated this day by way of Zoom. With families from five different states participating, they all logged on at a specific time, held a prayer at a given time, ate dinner in their own homes at the same time and ended their Thanksgiving Day dinner as they have done for years with each person expressing their feelings on what made them thankful.
 So, for Tom McGill’s family and all families, I hope and pray that Thanksgiving 2020 — however it was celebrated — was one in which we found reasons to be grateful as we always did, back in the day

Meanwhile, the Covid death rate across Lancashire and South Cumbria the week before the announcement was only slightly below its April peak, based on a rolling seven-day average.
 Along with pressure on the NHS, other factors listed in the reasoning for the government’s Tier 3 decision include a “very high” case rate in the over-60s in six unnamed Lancashire districts – of more than 200 per 100,000 people. The LDRS approached Public Health England for details of which areas exceeded that level, but was not directed towards the relevant localised data.
 The explanation for the county-wide Tier 3 status also referred to a continued “high” positive rate amongst those who come forward for testing. Published data shows that in the week ending November 18, the average proportion of Lancashire residents receiving a test who were then confirmed to have Covid was 10.7 per cent, compared to an England average of 9 per cent.
 Across Lancashire, that figure ranged from 5.3 in Lancaster to 14.8 in Blackburn and Hyndburn – and was falling in all areas bar Hyndburn week-on- week.
 South Ribble MP Katherine Fletcher – who is also a biology graduate who studied immunology and infectious medicine as part of her degree – says that having looked at a full range of data, it was with “a heavy heart” that she concluded Tier 3 was the right decision.

CEDAR PARK Sixth-grader Gracie Garbade stood by a busy street in her Cedar Park neighborhood on a sunny day two days before Thanksgiving with friends and family by her side.
   
 She waved a sign over her head that said, "Gracie's Canned Goods Food Drive."
   
 Within 40 minutes, three drivers stopped to give her donations, including first-grade teacher Jaclyn Ashby, who dropped off two giant garbage bags full of food collected at Sommers Elementary School.
   
 Gracie, 11, created her non-profit, Gracies Canned Goods, to raise money and collect canned goods for food pantries and groups that help families and students. The organization has donated $6,000 this year to five groups, including Hill Country Community Ministries, the Central Texas Food Bank and the Backpack Friends, said her mother, Melissa Garbade. Gracie also donated money she has raised this year to the Hope Austin and to the Backpack Coalition.
   
 So far this year, she has gathered almost 1,000 pounds of canned goods. Last year, when her parents established her non-profit, she collected $5,000 and 1,838 pounds of food.
   
 Gracie had just a few words to describe her mission while soliciting roadside donations Tuesday: "I want to make sure everyone has food to eat."
   
 This year, she is joining the Cedar Park Police Department's Blue Santa program to collecting food and donations for families in need.
   
 She started wanting to collect canned food when she was 5 years old and noticed homeless people, she said. "Seeing people on the street made me feel bad, and I wanted to help them."
   
 That year, she collected 100 pounds of food with the help of family and friends, her mother said. Gracie kept on collecting more and more food each year and setting higher and higher goals for herself.
   
 Gracie's family helps her with her efforts, her mother said. Grabade said she drives the canned goods that Gracie collects to Hill Country Ministries in Leander. Gracie's father, Brad Grabade, a salesman for a cybersecurity company, helps her with online efforts, such as her Facebook page, Gracies Canned Goods, which accepts donations.
   
 Her 8-year-old brother, Wyatt, helps organize the donated food. He also admires what people give.
   
 "Sloppy joe sauce," he said picking up a can that someone had just donated while Grace was standing with her sign. "Nice."
   
 The amount that people donate sometimes surprises her, Grace said. "Someone donated 20 boxes of cereal."
   
 Tiesa Holloway, a spokeswoman for Hill Country Ministries, said she first met Gracie when the girl was in the first grade. "She has the heart and the passion for not letting anyone go hungry."
   
 Over the years, Gracie has collected up to 20,000 pounds of food and several thousand dollars for Hill Country Community Ministries, which provides meals for several thousand families a year, Holloway said.
   
 "It's a big deal," said Holloway.
   
 Ashby, the teacher, said she has known Gracie since she was 5 years old and has watched her efforts to help others grow.
   
 "She has a heart of gold," Ashby said.
