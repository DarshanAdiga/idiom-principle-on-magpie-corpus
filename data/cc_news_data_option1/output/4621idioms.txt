BLAINE, Wash. (KIRO) - The first “murder hornet” nest that was found and destroyed in the U.S. had the ability to produce 200 queens, scientists say.“It really seems like we got there just in the nick of time,” said Sven-Erik Spichiger, an entomologist with the Washington Department of Agriculture.Researchers cut the Asian Giant Hornet’s nest out of tree and took the section back to cold storage. There, they pumped it full of carbon dioxide, which made it too cold for hornets to fly, as they opened the nest up.They used chopsticks to pick through and found 76 queens alive inside.“Everything we found (was) alive inside the nest, which would make sense had it likely emerged between the time we did the eradication and the time we did our examination,” Spichiger said.The nest had the ability to produce about 200 queens. About 108 of them were still in their cells in the nest. The other 76, plus three found when they took down the tree, were put on ice to study.If they had not found and eradicated the nest when they did, they’d be looking at the possibility of 200 more nests.Researchers think there are at least three nests in the county, and they will keep trying to find them.“There’s no way for us to ever be certain whether or not we got them all,” Spichiger said.However, as it gets colder, it’s harder for the hornets to fly around.“Should there be an active beehive attack, our chances are good of finding more. As people start going out hunting, they may stumble into one and let us know about it,” Spichiger said.The hornets were first detected in the U.S. in December. It’s unknown how they got to the U.S. from Asia.Scientists are worried about what they could do to the honeybee population. A few murder hornets can kill tens of thousand of honeybees in a hive in a few hours.Copyright 2020 KIRO via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday President Donald Trump is “100% within his rights” to question election results, as GOP lawmakers fall in line behind the White House.The Republican leader’s remarks, his first public comments since Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election, show how reluctant Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill have been to defy the president, even in his defeat.Most Republicans are refusing to congratulate Biden or declining to push Trump to accept the outcome, even though there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud.“Our institutions are actually built for this,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate. “We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.”McConnell said the process will play out and “reach its conclusion.”Republicans are closing the Trump era much the way they started it, by joining the president in shattering civic norms and sowing uncertainty in institutions, now in a way that threatens the nation’s normal transition of power.Privately, Republicans on Capitol Hill say they are in a tough spot, wary of crossing Trump and his most ardent supporters. But their actions are casting doubt on the durability of the nation’s elections system and impeding Biden’s new administration. The head of the General Services Administration under Trump has held off on formally beginning the Biden transition to the White House.Trump has declined to concede the presidential race and is mounting legal fights in several states, but there has been no indication or evidence of voter irregularities or widespread fraud in the election.The president’s refusal to accept the results means the election disputes could drag for weeks as states certify their tallies or push to mid-December, when the Electoral College is set to vote.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he would encourage the president “not to concede.”With the Senate majority on the line, Republicans don’t dare risk alienating Trump or his supporters ahead of Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.In Georgia, where Trump is teetering, both Republican senators are being forced into a Jan. 5 runoff that will determine party control. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler jointly called the their state’s election system an “embarrassment.”Many Republicans have signaled a December deadline, pointing to the time it took to resolve the disputed 2000 race before Democrat Al Gore conceded to Republican George W. Bush.McConnell spoke shortly after meeting with Attorney General William Barr at the Capitol. Barr has authorized federal prosecutors across the U.S. to pursue “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities, according to a memo to U.S. attorneys obtained by The Associated Press.“In the end, we want all legal ballots to be counted,” the No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise, told AP. “You go back to Bush v. Gore, it was second week of December that it got resolved ... so there’s still questions out there that need to get resolved and that process is playing itself out.”Unlike the 2000 election, when a few hundred votes in Florida separated Bush and Gore, Trump is casting a wide net of legal challenges in states where Biden is thousands of votes ahead of him.Some Republicans scoff at the president’s legal team, helmed by personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, and doubt the president has a credible route to challenge the election results. Election officials from both political parties have publicly stated the election went well.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Monday the Republicans' refusal to stand by the election results is “extremely dangerous, extremely poisonous to our democracy.”Schumer said election lawsuits can be valid but they must be based in evidence and facts. He dismissed Trump’s challenges as “frivolous.”“Joe Biden won the election fair and square,” Schumer said.McConnell and Republicans said Monday they don’t want the “media” to declare the outcome of the election.But actually, the results in the presidential election are being determined much they way they are in all elections — including those for the House and Senate that are not being questioned — based on an analysis of vote tallies.McConnell touted the results Monday of the congressional races — GOP senators brushed back Democratic challengers and House Republicans expanded their ranks — even as he raised questions about the presidential contest.“Let’s not have any lectures, no lectures, about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results,” McConnell said.Pressed if there was any evidence of voter fraud, GOP Sen. John Cornyn, who just won reelection in Texas, demurred.“That’s really not my, my role,” Cornyn told reporters on Capitol Hill. “There is a process that is available, and I don’t begrudge the president for availing himself of that process — but in the end, they’re going to have to come up with some facts and evidence.”Privately, Republicans on Capitol Hill have said they are trying to give Trump the time and space he needs to come to grips with the election results.“Well, I think he’s got a right, a constitutional right, if there are legal challenges they want to make,” said Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican. “Let those play out.”Republican lawmakers are hesitant to push Trump to concede to Biden, knowing it would anger their base of Trump’s most devoted supporters. But the Republican lawmakers are not overtly encouraging the president’s claims of fraud, even as they allow questions to linger.Only a handful of Republicans, including Sens. Susan Collins, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, have congratulated Biden on the election.“Stay out of the fray,” as one Republican aide put it. The aide and other Republicans were granted anonymity to frankly discuss the situation.Whatever the position, “you’re going to anger half the country,” said another Republican on Capitol Hill.At the same time, Republicans are feeling increasingly unmoored from the White House. Trump himself has not been returning some senators' phone calls, one of the aides said.Scalise said he spoke to Trump a few days ago and said the president “left it all on the field” in the campaign.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The Mediterranean is the preferred route for migrants from Africa, mostly from Libya, who try to cross to Europe through Italy and Malta. Crossings significantly increase in the summer and fall, with NGOs from various countries carrying out a number of rescue operations at sea. In 2019, the IOM recorded 1,283 deaths in the Mediterranean, with the route between North Africa and Italy being the deadliest. At least 19,164 migrants are estimated to have died at sea in the last five years.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senators chose party leaders Tuesday with few changes at the top, but it’s unclear who will be the majority leader in the new Congress with no party having secured&nbsp;control of the Senate&nbsp;until a January runoff election in Georgia.Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., won another term as Republican leader, his office said, cementing his role as the longest-serving GOP leader in U.S. history. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. won his party’s support to stay on leading the Democrats, according to a Democrat granted anonymity to discuss the closed-door balloting.None of the leaders were being challenged in Tuesday’s private party elections, with their entire leadership teams set to be reinstated.But it’s still to be determined whether McConnell will retain his role as majority leader or cede it to Schumer as the final races for the U.S. Senate play out.Last week’s elections left the chamber split, 48-48, heading into the new Congress next year. Republicans brushed back Democratic challengers in several states, but failed to lock down the seats needed to retain their majority.Races for&nbsp;two seats in Georgia&nbsp;heading to a Jan. 5 runoff are swiftly becoming a showdown over control of the chamber. The state is closely divided, with Democrats making gains on Republicans, fueled by a surge of new voters. But no Democrat has been elected senator in some 20 years.Two other seats in North Carolina and Alaska remain too early to call. In North Carolina, Sen. Thom&nbsp;Tillis&nbsp;is trying to fend off Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham in a tight race. Alaska GOP Sen. Dan&nbsp;Sullivan&nbsp;is favored for another term against Al Gross, an independent running as a Democrat.Even if Republicans secure the final two races where ballots are still being counted in North Carolina and Alaska, they would still fall short of the 51 seats needed.The math has become more challenging for McConnell because the vice president of the party holding the White House casts the tie-breaking vote in the Senate. Next year that would be Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. That means 50 seats for Democrats would result in control over the chamber. But Republicans would need 51 seats to cement their hold on power.The stakes are high for all sides, with strategists expecting an eye-popping $500 million could be spent on the Georgia runoff elections in the weeks ahead.GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler will face Rafael Warnock, a Black pastor from the church where Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. preached. And Republican Sen. David Perdue, a top Trump ally, will face Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff.A Democratic majority in the Senate, the party that also controls the House would give the party a firm grasp on power in Washington. Biden would have latitude over nominees, including for his Cabinet, and a chance to push major portions of his legislative agenda through Congress. If Democrats fall short, McConnell could wield the power to check Biden’s ambitions.The Democratic leadership team includes Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., as whip; Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., assistant leader, and several others, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., keeping leadership roles. Democrats added Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., to the leadership team.The Republican leadership team is set to include Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., as whip; with Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and others holding other leadership roles.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

WATERTOWN, N.Y. (WWNY) - "I’m in shock. I’m just in absolute shock, said Paddock Club owner Robert Dalton after he heard Governor Cuomo’s mandate that bars and restaurants must close daily at 10 p.m.He says the new rule is going to hurt his Watertown business.“We have to be open so many hours of the day to make money and stay in businesses. So 10 p.m.? I’m open until 2 a.m. 7 days a week. Now you’re shutting us down again at 10 p.m. I can’t make any money,” he said.Dalton says making money has already been a challenge during the pandemic. Under the new guidelines, restaurants, bars, and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. Curbside pickup for takeout and delivery services can continue past 10 p.m.“We’re all just taking a beating. I don’t know how we’re going to stay afloat. We’re treading water now,” said Dalton.Meanwhile, Maggie’s on the River in Watertown typically closes at midnight.“It puts a little bit of a damper having to close at 10 due to the fact that we have other places close earlier and we get all the people in the industry that come out for late night supper and to wind down after their shifts so that’s going to kind of take a little bit away from us, but we’ll make sure we accommodate and bounce back best we can,” saidZhaZha Prieto, assistant manager, Maggie’s on the River.Also new Wednesday, Governor Cuomo says private gatherings, such as parties, must be capped at 10 people. Local governments are responsible for enforcement.“You know, it’s not our desire. We are not going to go door knocking on anybody, but if you’ve got a party that has a lot of people there and we have clearly seen infections from that party, that’s going to be an issue,” said Scott Gray, Jefferson County Legislature chairman.Gray says that issue could mean a fine or other punitive measures.“It is important that we have people’s cooperation now more than ever,” he said.The governor said the state has seen the greatest surges tied to bars and restaurants, private gatherings and gyms. He is hoping these changes will help curb the rise in COVID cases.The new rules go into effect Friday.Copyright 2020 WWNY. All rights reserved.

For me, the tipping point in my career was when I became my own boss. After running my small business whilst at university, it always felt like a step backward to have to report to someone. I often have a very clear vision as to how I’d like to do things, for better or worse, so I knew that I’d never be content until I was really in control. I was lucky enough to find that via the opportunity I’ve had with launching the Twisted brand in new markets. We’ve gone from just one employee to over 25 staff. So far, we have achieved over 3 million dollars in sales and are on target to do over 7.5 million dollars this year. It’s nice to know that, whilst there have been some speed bumps, sticking to my beliefs and vision for the product has led to success. We’ve still got a long way to go but the foundations have been laid.

Beyond that, according to the report of the Middle East Eye, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also refused to meet with Pompeo if he did not come to Ankara to discuss bilateral relations. In the light of political turbulence in Washington, it is still unknown who will be the new president of the U.S., though 10 days have passed since the elections. Predictions indicate that the political chaos in the country will deepen further. Despite this blurry political landscape, Turkey has treated both presidential candidates with diplomatic and political courtesy. Perhaps this indecent act of Pompeo, who perhaps is the lame duck, came at a time when mutual respect had to be preserved and as mutual interests in Turkish-American relations are at stake more than ever.

Italy, which shocked the world and itself when hospitals in the wealthy north were overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases last spring, is again facing a systemic crisis, as confirmed positives pass the symbolic threshold of 1 million. Lombardy, Italy&#39;s most populous and productive region, is again the epicenter of Italy’s pandemic. As of Wednesday, 52% of Italy&#39;s hospital beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients, above the 40% warning threshold set by the health ministry. Nine of Italy’s 21 regions and autonomous provinces are in the red-alert zone set at above 50% virus occupancy, with Lombardy at 75%, Piedmont at 92% and South Tyrol at an astonishing 99%.

To add a disclaimer: I’m not telling people to quit their jobs today and work for themselves! I believe it’s important to work under others for a time too. Firstly — you’ve got to eat, so it’s best to always calculate the risks involved with going alone. Make sure that you can afford for it not to work out in the long run, as you never know what might happen. Secondly — to use an automotive analogy, it’s like running a car on a limiter until you understand the basics of its operation. Once you know how maintain it, clean it, drive it consistently, then it’s time to put the foot down. You must understand the fundamental basics of business before doing it for yourself, and the best way to do that is learn from others who already have that experience, by working for them.
