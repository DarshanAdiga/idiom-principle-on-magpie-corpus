The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has said that health insurers have to decide on authorization for cashless treatment to the network provider (hospital) within two hours from the time of receipt of authorization request and last necessary requirement from the hospital.
 The move is meant to ensure that health insurance claims of all coronavirus patients are dealt with swiftly.
 "In light of prevailing conditions owing to Covid-19 as also taking into consideration the need for alleviating the pressure on the healthcare infrastructure all insurers shall decide health insurance claims expeditiously," Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said in a circular.
 Health insurers also need to communicate their decision on final discharge to the hospital within two hours from the time of receipt of final bill and last necessary requirement, the insurance regulator said.
 "Decision on authorization for cashless treatment shall be communicated to the network provider hospital within two hours from the time of receipt of authorization request and last necessary requirement from the hospital either to the insurer or to the TPA whichever is earlier," the insurance regulator said.
 The insurance regulator has asked health insurers to issue appropriate guidelines to their respective third party administrators soon.
 Earlier this week, the Finance Ministry had extended the renewal dates of health and motor insurance policies falling during the nationwide lockdown till May 15 to ensure continuity.
 This extension is for policies that are due for renewal between March 25 and May 3.
 "With a view to mitigate hardship to policyholders whose health and motor (third party) insurance policies are due for renewal during Covid-19 lockdown, the government has issued notification allowing policyholders to make payments on or before 15.05.2020 towards renewal of their policies," the finance ministry had said in a tweet.

The union home ministry has issued a standard operating protocol for the movement of stranded migrant labourers within the states and Union Territories from April 20, when additional commercial activities resume in non-coronavirus hotspots. The government notice says that these migrant workers could be engaged in industrial, manufacturing, construction, farming and MNREGA works and the local administration could follow the guidelines being issued to facilitate their movement within the geographical boundaries of the state and or a Union territory.Here's what this order means for hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers who are mostly living out of relief camps set up by state governments.1. A registration exercise will be carried out at the relief camps for migrants where their skills will be noted to identify their work area like construction, manufacturing, sanitisation etc.2. Migrant workers will be transported to their place of work within the state if they express a desire to do so. But they will be first screened for the possibility of coronavirus infection and only those found with no symptoms will be allowed to return to their place of work.3. In no condition will the migrant workers be allowed to move or transported outside the state or Union territory where they are located currently. That would mean that a migrant worker who was employed in Kerala but travelled to Karnataka before he was put up in a relief camp will not be allowed to return to Kerala and will need to find work in Karnataka for the time being.4. Buses transporting migrants will have to be sanitized and the migrants will have to observe social distancing norms while travelling to their places of work.5. The local authorites are also directed to provide food and water to the migrants for their journey to the place of work.6.The migrant labourers who will continue to stay at the relief centres should be given nutritious food to ensure they stay healthy.

For once, a region which has not produced a World Cup semi-finalist in the past 80 years, now finds itself at the heart of the game's affairs - but for all the wrong reasons.
 The Gold Cup, the continental championship for CONCACAF's North and Central America and Caribbean, begins on Sunday in Dallas with Trinidadian Warner, who has been at the organisation's helm for over 20 years, 'barred from all football activities' pending an investigation into bribery allegations.
 Vice-president Lisle Austin of Barbados is temporarily at the head of the federation while the process plays out but it remains to be seen if he will look to replace Warner, who was re-elected unanimously, on a permanent basis.
 The suspension, handed down by FIFA's Ethics Committee on Sunday, relates to allegations that were reported to FIFA by CONCACAF's American general secretary Chuck Blazer.
 When CONCACAF re-elected Warner at its congress on May 3 - the alliance between the bearded Blazer from New York and Trinidadian Warner looked, on the surface to be strong.
 But behind the scenes, Warner, who like Blazer was a long-standing ally of FIFA president Sepp Blatter, was planning a meeting with Qatari Mohammed Bin Hammam. It was a get-together where, Blazer alleges, bribes were handed out.
 The charges have been denied by Warner and Bin Hammam but some Caribbean federations, including Puerto Rico's, have backed up the claims according to FIFA.
 Warner says he has statements from 13 Caribbean federations backing him. But that presumably leaves 12 that no longer are willing to give him their support, a near halving of his power base.
 With little hard support for Warner in Central and North America, his majority has dissipated and it is hard to see how he could come back to power.
 Warner has based his power on the Caribbean Football Union's 25 votes - allied with Blazer's diplomatic skills at keeping the United States and Mexico on board.
 Now that the relationship between Blazer and Warner has been broken and Warner has lost his monolithic vote block in the Caribbean, all bets are off.
 Mexico, the most successful football nation in the region, has long been uncomfortable with CONCACAF politics and while rumours of them splitting away to join South America's CONMEBOL are almost certainly fanciful, they may decide that now is the time to lead the Spanish-speaking countries, into a stronger role.
 The United States are growing as an economic power in the sport and while they have been close allies of Warner's - through Blazer - they too may feel this is the right moment to use their financial weight and take on a leadership role.
 But the numbers - 25 out of 35 full FIFA members from the region - remain with the Caribbean and it is there that the short-term future direction of the confederation will be decided.
 Will the Warner loyalists look to re-establish their power or will the rebels, who have provided evidence against him, be joined by more defectors in th

Ceballos, a 16-year-old attacking midfielder, was rated as one of the most exciting prospects to come out of the Catalans’ famed La Masia youth academy in recent years, but was eventually released on a free transfer earlier this season when his relationship with the club deteriorated.
 The youngster was then taken on trial at Chelsea where he trained with both the youth and senior squads, but it now appears Spurs have won the race for his signature.
 A source close to the player told _ESPN Soccernet_ he was in no doubt that the White Hart Lane outfit have made a great decision in tying Ceballos to a three-year contract.
 "The boy captained Barca's Under-17s and here we have a proper player, potentially one of the greats if he develops as people think he might,” he said.
 "He went to Chelsea for two weeks and trained for three days with the first- team before a Champions League game such was the impression he made, but for some strange reason no one seemed to make a decision about him.
 "Now, he has signed a three-year contract with Spurs and Harry Redknapp has a player who will be in his first-team within a year."

Authorities have predicted ash from the Grimsvotn volcano will cover Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland and parts of northern Britain by on Tuesday but said they did not expect a repeat of last year's travel chaos.
 Guardiola said the Barca players and staff would not be taking any chances ahead of the game against Manchester United at Wembley and could bring their trip, planned for Thursday, forward and take a land route rather than fly.
 "We need advice from the experts of course," he told a news conference at the Spanish club's Nou Camp stadium.
 "Let´s see what they tell us and if they say we shouldn´t risk it we´ll travel tomorrow or the day after.
 "Seeing as the volcano has been asleep for a couple of years I hope it will be asleep for a couple more days."
 Barca were forced to travel by bus to Milan for their Champions League semi- final first leg against Inter last season after a different Icelandic volcano erupted and caused air travel gridlock across Europe.
 They lost the match 3-1 and went out 3-2 on aggregate after the return leg in Barcelona.
 Guardiola said it was out of the question UEFA would postpone Saturday's match, a repeat of the 2009 final in Rome which Barca won 2-0.
 He said he was concerned some of the around 20,000 supporters planning to travel to England would have trouble making the trip from the Catalan capital.
 "I hope the news tomorrow (Tuesday) will be good because at the end of the day this is a show for the people," the 40-year-old former Barca and Spain player said.
 "It would be very sad to be there in a final and have half the stadium empty because people couldn't travel.
 "It is important to have people there but I don't think that we could ever delay the final. I hope we can get there but also the fans as it would be pointless to be there without them."
 Europe's air traffic control organisation said on Monday if volcanic emissions continued at the same rate the cloud could reach western French and northern Spanish airspace on Thursday.

 They flew back from London on Sunday afternoon on a plane decorated in the club colours with huge pictures of the players adorning the side and touched down at the city's El Prat airport at around 4pm local time.
 Boarding an open-top bus, Barcelona wound their way through the thronged streets with the European Cup and La Liga trophies displayed at the front of the vehicle.

 With fireworks going off and rock music blaring inside the arena, the players and the coaching staff were announced one by one before coach Pep Guardiola and his assistant Tito Vilanova brought the Champions League trophy on to the pitch.

 U.N. experts have recommended blacklisting 14 vessels for violating sanctions against North Korea in a report that accuses the country of increasing illegal coal exports, imports of petroleum products and continuing with cyber attacks on financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to gain illicit revenue. The 267-page report, obtained Saturday by The Associated Press, also accused North Korea of importing luxury vehicles, watches and liquor and other sanctioned items including robotic machinery, and continuing to illegally access international banking channels 'mainly by using third party intermediaries.' The U.N. Security Council has imposed increasingly tough sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the country's official name, including banning most of its exports and severely limiting is imports, to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The full report by the panel of experts monitoring the sanctions provides more details to the summary and some excerpts reported by AP in February. It includes photos of ballistic missile launchers, nuclear sites and vessels recommended for blacklisting. The panel made 39 recommendations to the Security Council, including on the blacklisting of 14 vessels. It said one vessel is registered in Sierra Leone and six were previously registered in the West African nation. Two are North Korean, one is Chinese, one Vietnamese, one was formerly registered in Togo, one was formerly registered in St. Kitts and Nevis, and the flag of one is unknown. China has been neighboring North Korea's largest trading partner and has been considered critical to enforcing U.N. sanctions. The panel said the Chinese-flagged Yun Hong 8 -- which it recommended for sanctions -- made at least 10 port calls between February and October 2019 at the North Korean port of Nampo and delivered refined petroleum. It was also observed during that period receiving refined petroleum from other foreign-flagged vessels, which an unidentified U.N. member state said was likely for delivery to the DPRK, the experts said. China responded to the panel's inquiry about the vessel by questioning 'the serious lack of accuracy of the relevant information,' the report said. China's Foreign Ministry and U.N. ambassador have said the country is implementing the sanctions. A photo in the report provided by an unnamed U.N. member state shows multiple coal-laden DPRK-flagged vessels at anchor near Lianyungang, China, which the panel said is being used to conduct ship-to-ship coal transfers. The panel said it is investigating a Vietnam-flagged vessel, the Phuong Linh 269, suspected of delivering coal originating in North Korea to the Chinese port of Qisha on multiple occasions. Despite a U.N. ban, the panel said North Korea's coal exports increased in 2019. It cited an unnamed member state saying the DPRK exported 3.7 million tons of coal between January and August 2019, with an estimated value of $370 million. The Security Council also banned the export of earth and stone, which includes sand. The panel said an unidentified member state reported that a substantial sand-export operation from the DPRK to China has been carried out since May 2019 with over 100 illicit shipments involving at least 1 million tons of sand worth at least $22 million. 'China responded that it attached great importance to the clues provided by the panel in relation to the smuggling of sand originating in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,' but was unable to confirm that the sand had been transported to Chinese ports, the report said. As for the import of refined petroleum products, which is limited 500,000 barrels annually, the panel said the addition of larger foreign-flagged tankers delivering to the DPRK has expanded its illicit imports. It said an unidentified member state calculated that in the first 10 months of 2019, 'foreign-flagged tankers alone had made a total of 64 deliveries, amounting to between 560,000 and 1.531 million barrels of refined petroleum products.' The panel said North Korea has also continued to transfer fishing rights in violation of sanctions, which earned the country $120 million in 2018, according to an unnamed member state. Under a 2017 sanctions resolution, all DPRK nationals working overseas were to be repatriated by Dec. 22, 2019. In China, Russia and elsewhere, there is strong demand for cheap North Korean workers. The U.S. State Department previously estimated there were about 100,000 North Korean workers worldwide, and civilian experts said those workers brought the DPRK an estimated $200 million to $500 million in revenue a year. The report said 'in multiple cases, workers were not repatriated to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea but moved to a third country.' The panel said an unnamed member state alleged that 2,000 North Koreans 'recently entered China on visitor visas for the purpose of earning income.' In response to its inquiry, the panel said China replied that it could not verify the allegation. On individual cases, the experts said North Korean soccer player Han Kwang Song, who joined the youth wing of Italy's Juventus Football Club in 2019, joined the Qatari team al-Duhail in January, and Choe Son Hyok has been playing for Italy's Societa Sportiva Arezzo since 2018. Austria reported that it had initiated procedures to revoke the work permit of Pak Kwang Ryong, who has played for Sportklub Niederösterreich St. Pölten since 2017. As for cyber attacks, the panel said North Korea is becoming 'increasingly sophisticated' in targeting both financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges, which deal in virtual money like bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. Last August, the panel said North Korean cyber experts illegally raised money for the country's weapons of mass destruction programs 'with total proceeds to date estimated at up to $2 billion.' In the new report, the panel cited a U.S. court document in which Virgil Griffith, an American who spoke at an April 2019 'cryptocurrency conference' in Pyongyang, said organizers told him that 'during his presentation, (he) should stress the potential money laundering and sanction evasion applications of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.'

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has said that health insurers have to decide on authorization for cashless treatment to the network provider (hospital) within two hours from the time of receipt of authorization request and last necessary requirement from the hospital.The move is meant to ensure that health insurance claims of all coronavirus patients are dealt with swiftly. "In light of prevailing conditions owing to Covid-19 as also taking into consideration the need for alleviating the pressure on the healthcare infrastructure all insurers shall decide health insurance claims expeditiously," Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said in a circular.Health insurers also need to communicate their decision on final discharge to the hospital within two hours from the time of receipt of final bill and last necessary requirement, the insurance regulator said."Decision on authorization for cashless treatment shall be communicated to the network provider hospital within two hours from the time of receipt of authorization request and last necessary requirement from the hospital either to the insurer or to the TPA whichever is earlier," the insurance regulator said.The insurance regulator has asked health insurers to issue appropriate guidelines to their respective third party administrators soon.Earlier this week, the Finance Ministry had extended the renewal dates of health and motor insurance policies falling during the nationwide lockdown till May 15 to ensure continuity.This extension is for policies that are due for renewal between March 25 and May 3."With a view to mitigate hardship to policyholders whose health and motor (third party) insurance policies are due for renewal during Covid-19 lockdown, the government has issued notification allowing policyholders to make payments on or before 15.05.2020 towards renewal of their policies," the finance ministry had said in a tweet.

Rep. Greg Gianforte has been running a positive campaign for governor, and poll after poll we’ve seen that Montanans are responding to it by supporting his candidacy. And now Greg has doubled down on this approach by adding another principled conservative with a history of success to the ticket. Kristen Juras is a tremendous complement to Greg, and will run on the same positive message that is winning with Montanans.
 Seeing everything that is happening around the world, it is uplifting to know that people like Greg Gianforte and Kristen Juras are placing their focus on getting Montana up and running rather than wasting precious time compiling ways to attack opponents or those who have differing views.
