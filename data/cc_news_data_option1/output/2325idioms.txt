Las propiedades calmantes de la lavanda son de sobra conocidas, pero un estudio en ratones realizado por investigadores japoneses, revela que es el sentido del olfato, el que activa esos efectos relajantes y sugiere, ademas, su potencial uso medicinal contra el estres y la ansiedad. El estudio, divulgado en la revista especializada Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience, consistio en probar en ratones si es el olor del linalool, un compuesto quimico presente en la lavanda, lo que efectivamente desencadena la relajacion. Unos ratones fueron expuestos al vapor de linalool para que lo olieran directamente y a otros se les administro ese compuesto a traves de inyecciones. Como en estudios anteriores, el olor del linaool tuvo un efecto ansiolitico en los ratones expuestos a el y no afecto a sus movimientos. Mientras, los efectos en los ratones a los que se les inyecto el linalool fueron similares a los que provoca el alcohol y sus movimientos si se vieron alterados. Sin embargo, para los investigadores la evidencia crucial de que la capacidad relajante del linalool esta intrinsecamente ligada al sentido del olfato fue comprobar que los ratones anosmicos, aquellos cuyas neuronas olfativas se destruyeron, no experimentaron ningun efecto calmante.

The portion size of our meals is particularly important. Our portion depends on our activity level, our stress level and our sleep. Overeating and undereating are responsible to a turbulence in our gut health. For our portion control, I suggest having meals in a traditional thaali, a compartmentalised plate. It is highly effective in controlling the portions and displaying all the components of food. You can take another serving or a half as per your needs. It gives a visual representation of meals and helps in establishing a connection between food and other senses as well.

Penzler and others cite Joseph Wambaugh's 1971 novel “The New Centurions” as a turning point in showing a more realistic portrait of police, although no single trend has prevailed. Over the past 50 years, the image of law enforcement has sometimes mirrored debates between liberals and conservatives. Sidney Lumet's 1973 film “Serpico” dramatized the corruption of New York City police and the heroism of the real-life title character's willingness to speak out. Around the same time, Clint Eastwood's “Dirty Harry” movies positioned Eastwood's San Francisco lawman as a needed rule-breaker in a system too permissive of crime. Spike Lee's landmark 1989 release “Do the Right Thing,” in which a black man is choked to death by police, was released two weeks after the premiere of “Lethal Weapon 2” and the crowd pleasing defiance of Mel Gibson's Sgt. Martin Riggs.

La tragedia ha avuto luogo all'interno di uno stabilimento balneare, nel pomeriggio di sabato 13 giugno a Marina di Ravenna, una località situata nella provincia della città romagnola. Sconvolti la famiglia e tutti coloro che lo conoscevano. In base al racconto di chi ha assistito alla scena, l'adolescente è uscito dalla piscina dopo avere accusato dei problemi. Subito dopo si è sentito male e ha perso i sensi. I bagnini presenti gli hanno prestato immediatamente soccorso, ma invano. Andrea si è accasciato a terra e non si è mai più ripreso. Nel breve volgere di pochi minuti è arrivata anche una ambulanza, ma neppure il personale del 118 è riuscito a far riprendere il 17enne, nonostante il personale sanitario gli abbia praticato un massaggio cardiaco.
