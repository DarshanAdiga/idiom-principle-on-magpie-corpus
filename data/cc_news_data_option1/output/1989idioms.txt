For North Grand Cinema owners Diane and Lee Akin, Wednesday was just like any other day they've experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they were discussing with the cinema's managers whether they'd be selling large bags of popcorn on the curb this upcoming weekend.
   
 But shortly after 11 a.m., Gov. Kim Reynolds announced a new proclamation for the state, lifting additional restrictions on businesses including movie theaters, swimming pools, museums, wedding venues, zoos, aquariums and high school sports, effective this Friday.
   
 The proclamation also allows bars, or establishments which serve alcohol but were limited to carry-out, to open and operate at 50% capacity next Thursday, May 28.
   
 Despite the governor's green light, North Grand Cinema will remain closed for the time being, Diane Akin said.
   
 "We will not be opening the theater on Friday because Hollywood is not releasing any movies, so we wouldn't have anything new to show," Akin said. "We can play (older movies), but being that it's Wednesday, we couldn't possibly line anything up by Friday."
   
 Release dates for upcoming films including "MARVEL's Black Widow," "James Bond No Time To Die" and "A Quiet Place part II," have all been pushed back as a result of the pandemic.
   
 Wednesday's announcement was shocking to hear, Akin added, as they anticipated reopening in late June or early July.
   
 An official reopening date has not yet been set for the theatre.
   
 Like North Grand Cinema, Ames History Museum will remain closed to the general public for the foreseeable future, according to the museum exhibit manager Alex Fejfar.
   
 "We are paying attention to what's happening in the community and we're taking notes from some of our partners, especially in our area of downtown," Fejfar said.
   
 The museum is following City Council meetings, as well as looking into how Ames Public Library approaches reopening, as the two have similar clientele, he said. Last week, Ames City Council extended closures to city facilities include the library until July 1, and Fejfar said he doesn't believe the museum will open until the library does.
   
 "We're just looking around us and taking what those organizations are doing into consideration," he said.
   
 Beginning next Thursday, bars, along with establishments selling alcohol but have been limited to carry out, will be allowed to open at limited capacity, Reynolds announced on Wednesday.
   
 Though the announcement is exciting for Della Viti owner Beth DeVries, the safety of staff and customers is a priority, she said.
   
 "I am excited to open; I don't know if it's going to be next Friday … I'm hoping (it will)," DeVries said. "We've got some changes to make still, I've got to continue training with staff. I'm hoping to bring back a good portion of my staff, I'm not quite sure exactly yet as I'm still working on the scheduling."
   
 DeVries said the wine bar has taken out 50 percent of seating to abide by the capacity guidelines.
   
 "I know there are some bars in the community here and elsewhere that are just kind of flipping on the switch and letting people do whatever, and that is frustrating because it makes it hard for those of us who want to open up correctly," DeVries said. "We don't want the people that would normally come out to our space and have a glass of wine or a cheese plate … to be scared that (what) they've seen on the news is going to happen here.
   
 "Its been detrimental."
   
 There are a lot of things bars will have to do to ensure safety for customers and staff, DeVries said.
   
 "I think that it's on us in the hospitality industry to maintain making sure that people stay in their seated areas, make sure they are six feet apart, and really we aren't policing, but we need to maintain the safety standards," DeVries said.
   
 After Reynolds issued a State of Health Emergency for Iowa on March 17, DeVries said her business had to be immediately adjusted as they had to "switch from being on premise to strictly off premise."
   
 "We already had a retail license that was part of my expanding liquor license that I had, and so I was able to sell wine immediately through retail bottles, but we initially lost about 90 percent of my income and gross sales, and it gradually came back up as I worked to put everything online," DeVries said.
   
 These past few months have taught DeVries to look at business differently, she said.
   
 "Learning new things has probably been the one thing that I have done the most in this period of time," DeVries said. "The only other period of time where I have done as much learning in such a short amount of time is when I bought the business."
   
 Even though more restirctions are beginning to be lifted throughout Iowa, Diane Akin's said every business owner will never forget this pandemic.
   
 "It's truly been an eye opening experience," she said.

The economy isn't going to bounce back quickly on its own from the coronavirus pandemic. State reopenings, premature or not, will restore a modicum of economic activity, but it won't be enough to put many local businesses in the black. If the virus comes roaring back in states that reopen, it will cause a wave of fear that will depress demand and send some places back into lockdown. Meanwhile, wary consumers are saving their money, which will depress demand. And global trade networks and supply chains will remain in shambles for some time as the pandemic reverberates around the world. Meanwhile, although the pace of unemployment claims has slowed slightly, millions of Americans continue to lose their jobs.
   
 The federal government therefore can't afford to let up on its attempts to relieve Americans' pain and preserve as much economic activity as possible. The $2 trillion CARES Act was an encouraging example of bold bipartisan action that addressed many of the country's most urgent needs back in late March. But as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized last week and is likely to reiterate in Senate testimony today, the country is overdue for another round of stimulus.
   
 The House of Representatives last week passed its version of that second round, called the HEROES Act. The $3 trillion spending bill is unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled Senate without substantial changes, but it represents a good opening bid.
   
 The most important element of the House relief plan is money for state and local governments. Although the pandemic has increased their spending needs, many of these governments are limited in their ability to spend by balanced- budget amendments written into state constitutions. Even those that are not typically have to pay much higher interest rates to borrow than the federal government. Thus, it makes financial sense for the federal government to take most of the financial burden off smaller governments.
   
 The House bill does this, with $500 billion for state governments and $375 billion for local governments. The former number lines up with a recent report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a center-left think tank, which predicts a $500 billion state budget shortfall during the next three years. Those numbers are likely to be reduced in the final bill, and that's fine; for example, some of the local government spending is redundant because states use some of their budgets to support localities. But robust relief to state and local governments will help avoid one of the biggest mistakes of the Great Recession.
   
 A second important piece of the bill is more funding for test-and-trace efforts. Most of the U.S. still doesn't have enough testing or contact tracing to suppress future outbreaks of the virus. As a number of economists and public health experts have pointed out, these suppression capabilities offer the single highest return on investment that government spending can get right now. Test-and-trace systems are the essential tool used by New Zealand, South Korea and other countries that have contained COVID-19. With the threat of the virus in check, economic reopening will be safe from sudden reversals.
   
 When it comes to economic relief for households, though, the House bill could use some improvement. The bill's main approach is to double down on the strategies in the CARES Act -- modest one-time universal payments of $1,200 per person, plus a big extension of supersized unemployment-insurance benefits through the end of the year.
   
 This is a lot of money, which is good. But much more of it should be in the form of universal payments and less in the form of unemployment benefits. The main reason is that many unemployed Americans have had trouble accessing the benefits that the CARES Act allotted to them, and there's no reason to expect anything different in the coming months. State unemployment systems are not equipped to deal with the number or scale of the requests being made. So far, this has meant that a very large share of unemployed workers -- by some estimates, almost half -- have either been denied benefits or are still waiting.
   
 This is unacceptable. So far, workers either denied or forced to wait have been spending down their savings, but there's no way that can continue for the rest of 2020.
   
 If the government wants to both minimize human suffering and cushion the long- term blow to consumer demand, it should shift much of the relief effort away from the unemployment-insurance system and toward universal payments. Instead of a one-time payment of $1,200 per person, the relief bill should include recurring universal payments for the rest of the year. Because these payments are administered through the tax system, they're much quicker and more reliable than state unemployment checks. Also, because they're universal instead of based on employment status, these payments are less likely to deter workers from going back to work quickly once the pandemic threat has passed.
   
 The time for worrying about benefit targeting has passed. This depression is going to affect all Americans, and the solution is a relief bill that focuses more on supporting all Americans.

The man who filmed the video of two white men fatally shooting an unarmed a black man who was jogging down a road has now also been arrested, officials announced Thursday.
 William “Roddie” Bryan Jr., 50, is expected to face charges of felony murder and criminal intent to commit false imprisonment in connection with the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.
 He is the third man to be arrested in connection with the Feb. 23 fatal shooting. Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis McMichael, 34, were arrested and charged with murder and aggravated assault earlier this month after the video Bryan filmed of the Feb. 23 fatal shooting was made public.
 Bryan followed the father and son in his own vehicle as they chased Arbery down the road, according to a Glynn County police report of the shooting. The McMichaels told police that they believed Arbery was a suspect in a string of break-ins in the neighborhood.
 The police report said that Bryan "attempted to block" Arbery when he tried to run back in the direction he came from after Travis McMichael attempted to cut him off in his vehicle.
 However, Bryan's attempt was "unsuccessful," the report said. He is listed as a witness on the police report.
 Bryan is a neighbor of the McMichaels and lives within a mile of where Arbery was fatally shot.
 Shortly after the McMichaels were arrested, officials said they were also investigating Bryan.
 S. Lee Merritt, an attorney for Arbery's family, has previously referred to Bryan as a "suspect," alleging that he "conspired" with the McMichaels to kill Arbery.
 In a statement on Thursday, attorneys said Arbery's family was "relieved" to learn about Bryan's arrest and thanked the Bureau of Investigation for their work on the case.
 "We called for his arrest from the very beginning of this process," the attorneys said. "His involvement in the murder of Mr. Arbery was obvious to us, to many around the country and after their thorough investigation, it was clear to the FBI as well."

The National Federation of State High School Associations released guidelines this week for the return of high school sports from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Some of the protocols and procedures are formidable and leave one wondering if sports can return at all. For example, during phase one of the return, teams can’t use a common ball in practice without disinfecting it after each player’s touch.
 The NFHS recommendations should also be causing New Jersey athletic directors, coaches and the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association to think outside the box. That means embracing radical ideas, such as baseball in the fall and football in the spring.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The two astronauts who will end a nine-year launch drought for NASA arrived at Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday, exactly one week before their historic SpaceX flight.
 It will be the first time a private company, rather than a national government, sends astronauts into orbit.
 NASA test pilots Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken flew to Florida from their home base in Houston aboard one of the space agency’s jets.
 “It’s an incredible time for NASA and the space program, once again launching U.S. crews from Florida and hopefully in just a week from about right now,” Hurley told reporters minutes after arriving.
 Hurley was one of the four astronauts who arrived at Kennedy on July 4, 2011, for the final space shuttle flight, “so it’s incredibly humbling to be here to start out the next launch from the United States.”
 “We feel it as an opportunity but also a responsibility for the American people, for the SpaceX team, for all of NASA,” Behnken added.
 The two are scheduled to blast off next Wednesday afternoon atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, bound for the International Space Station. They’ll soar from the same pad where Atlantis closed out the shuttle program in 2011, the last home launch for NASA astronauts.
 Since then, the only way to the space station for astronauts has been on Russian rockets launched from Kazakhstan.
 Hurley and Behnken still don’t know how long they’ll spend at the space station: anywhere between one and four months. Only one American is up there right now — astronaut Chris Cassidy — and could use a hand. Hurley said he got an email from Cassidy on Tuesday night in which he wrote that “he’s looking forward to seeing our ugly mugs on board.”
 Greeting the astronauts at Kennedy’s former shuttle landing strip were the center’s director, former shuttle commander Robert Cabana, and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine.
 “You really are a bright light for all of America right now,” Bridenstine told them.
 The welcoming committee was reduced drastically in size because of the coronavirus pandemic. There were no handshakes for the astronauts, who did not wear masks but kept their distance at separate microphones. Cabana and Bridenstine wore masks except while addressing the crowd; so did the approximately 20 journalists standing more than 20 feet away.
 During these tough times, Bridenstine said, “this is a moment when we can all look and be inspired as to what the future holds.”
 NASA’s commercial crew program has been years in the making. Boeing, the competing company, isn’t expected to launch its first astronauts until next year.
 As the trailblazers, Hurley and Behnken are establishing new prelaunch traditions. They shared two at Bridenstine’s request Wednesday.
 Hurley, a former Marine and fighter pilot, followed military tradition and put a mission sticker on the SpaceX flight simulator in Houston on Tuesday, after completing training. Behnken, an Air Force colonel, followed Russian custom and planted a tree. He had help back home from his wife, who’s also an astronaut, and their 6-year-old son.
 “My son will always have that lemon tree that he was a part of planting,” Behnken said. “Hopefully, it makes it through Houston’s hot summer this year and becomes a tradition for some other folks as well.”

Since marrying in 2002, Doug Behan and Lise Deguire have gone on safari in Tanzania, watched the sunset over the Santorini caldera in the Greek Islands and walked through the ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru.      And those are just a few of their annual excursions. "It's on my bucket list that I want to visit every continent," Deguire said.      Early this year, the Yardley, Pennsylvania, couple began planning a 12-day trip to Japan in March. But then news of COVID-19 began saturating the airwaves. By February, the couple made the difficult decision to cancel, instead booking a one-week trip to New Mexico. As the virus continued to spread even more, they nixed that, too, replacing it with a three-day retreat at a local spa.      But on March 19, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf ordered all non-life- sustaining businesses to close their physical locations.      "That was pretty devastating," Deguire said. "Travel makes me feel very alive, like living on the edge in a way that's exciting and fulfilling."      It's not just tourists who are canceling trips. North Carolina's Outer Banks set up checkpoints to greet visitors, temporarily barring non-permanent residents and those without an entry permit. It's one of several resort communities around the country, including Key West and California's Mono County, which requested visitors stay away - sacrificing vital tourism dollars in an effort to keep out COVID-19.      That's in line with recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends people stay at home as much as possible and to avoid travel altogether, especially when sick.      The unprecedented travel restrictions may take a toll, said James Petrick, a professor, research fellow and the associate department head for graduate studies in the department of recreation, parks and tourism sciences at Texas A&M; University in College Station.      "We know that we learn much more when we're experiencing new things, and relationships are stronger when a couple travels together," he said. "The benefits that we receive when we travel don't just exist on vacation. They exist afterward and embed themselves in our existence."      Indeed, a number of studies have shown that even planning for a vacation makes people happier.      Not to mention the health benefits.      A 2000 trial that tracked middle-aged men for nine years found those who take an annual vacation were less likely to die from heart attacks and other cardiovascular-related issues. And women who vacation regularly were found in a 1992 study to be less likely to have a heart attack or coronary death than those who did so less often.      That makes sense to Petrick. "If I travel somewhere and come back, I'm less stressed than I was before."      And stress can impact health and wellbeing in many ways. According to Dr. Anand Rohatgi, a preventive cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, chronic stress can flood the body with compounds called catecholamines, which include so-called stress hormones like adrenaline.      "If you're always having increased catecholamines in your system, it can lead to high blood pressure, worse metabolism and worsening of inflammation in your body," Rohatgi said. "Over time, that can lead to more plaques in your arteries, heart attacks and strokes.      "Whatever your environment is, if it's stressful, taking a break from it can improve heart health," he added.      Both Petrick and Rohatgi said to achieve the greatest effect, the vacation should be distinctly different from one's day-to-day environment - especially the stressful parts. That means, for one, fighting the temptation to check work emails.      "It's important to relax and not have to think about things that add to stress - how am I going to pay the bills, work responsibilities and perhaps even caretaking responsibilities," Rohatgi said. "You want to be in a place where that burden is lifted."      In a time when travel is all but restricted, however, what should people do to achieve those benefits?      Rohatgi recommends people get out and explore new parks and trails, visit new areas in the community and develop new hobbies. Setting aside time to be alone also is important.      "Read a book, listen to music, and build in a couple of times per day where you can go outside and take a walk," he said.      Petrick advises people to get creative about how they vary their routine. One idea is to take a drive and allow a literal roll of the dice to determine which way to turn at each intersection.      "When we get outside of our usual environment, the brain is much more active," he said. "If you are staycationing, you have to find a way to make it novel."      Doug Behan and Lise Deguire have taken that to heart.      For example, during a recent "Lord of the Rings" viewing party with their two college-age daughters and a friend who is staying with them, the entire family dressed up as the characters from the movie, repurposing old rings, reimagining a pair of scissors as a sword and turning old clothes into hobbit capes and elf crowns.   "It was a hoot," Deguire said.      But she admits it's not quite as exciting as getting away. The entire clan was scheduled to depart on a Canadian cruise in August, but in late April, Deguire canceled that, too.      "Everyone is pretty sad about that, but we hope to reschedule," she said. "Travel memories are really bonding and important for us as a couple and a family."

These answers aren't very satisfying for McDaniel.
 "As it stands right now, more and more are being censored and work that is vital and life-giving is being taken down at a rapid rate," they said.
 McDaniel also knows the human element of this all too well. Their work is often subject to brigades of body-shaming trolls who report their images. Platforms like Instagram are certainly aware of this phenomenon and say the number of reports doesn't automatically trigger anything, but not everyone is so sure it doesn't play a part.
 Kat Lo, a researcher who studies content moderation and online harassment, said reports may play some part in the larger machinery of moderation, but so do people.
 "That’s what so insidious about technological systems that are so big. There’s so many steps and so many opportunities for even small instances of bias to creep in," she said.
 Due to bias present in society, she said, it's very possible that when an image of a larger person falls before a human moderator, they're more likely to mark it as "obscene" or sexualized than an image of a smaller person.
 "There’s thousands and thousands of little reasons rather than broader reasons like 'I see a nipple,'" she said.
 Because of all these gray areas, and because of the sheer scale of these moderation databases, actually fixing a potential problem like this would be expensive and time-consuming, and companies have very little motivation to do it.
 Lo said apps like Instagram or TikTok are under pressure to keep things PG, both to keep themselves available on app stores, but also due to laws like FOSTA-SESTA or the resources it takes to remove terrorism-related content. It's just easier to err on the side of caution.

In a press conference on Thursday, Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted announced a change in policy regarding wedding receptions.
 While weddings and funerals have always been exempt from the health orders issued by the state, receptions have been under strict guidelines and restrictions.
 Beginning June 1, catering and banquet centers will be able to reopen, using similar guidelines restaurants must abide by—including six-foot distancing between tables and no congregating for the time being, according to Husted.
 Crowd sizes at receptions will be limited to 300 guests, Husted said.
 “We recognize that there are a lot of weddings and events that are important to people’s lives. That can and should go on,” Husted said. “We are just asking that it be done safely as possible to avoid the spread of the virus. We recognize that people want to go on with life, and we are trying to provide guidelines and recommendations as to how you can do so as safely as possible.”

 The economy isn't going to bounce back quickly on its own from the coronavirus pandemic. State reopenings, premature or not, will restore a modicum of economic activity, but it won't be enough to put many local businesses in the black. If the virus comes roaring back in states that reopen, it will cause a wave of fear that will depress demand and send some places back into lockdown. Meanwhile, wary consumers are saving their money, which will depress demand. And global trade networks and supply chains will remain in shambles for some time as the pandemic reverberates around the world. Meanwhile, although the pace of unemployment claims has slowed slightly, millions of Americans continue to lose their jobs.
 The federal government therefore can't afford to let up on its attempts to relieve Americans' pain and preserve as much economic activity as possible. The $2 trillion CARES Act was an encouraging example of bold bipartisan action that addressed many of the country's most urgent needs back in late March. But as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized last week and is likely to reiterate in Senate testimony today, the country is overdue for another round of stimulus.
 The House of Representatives last week passed its version of that second round, called the HEROES Act. The $3 trillion spending bill is unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled Senate without substantial changes, but it represents a good opening bid.
 The most important element of the House relief plan is money for state and local governments. Although the pandemic has increased their spending needs, many of these governments are limited in their ability to spend by balanced- budget amendments written into state constitutions. Even those that are not typically have to pay much higher interest rates to borrow than the federal government. Thus, it makes financial sense for the federal government to take most of the financial burden off smaller governments.
 The House bill does this, with $500 billion for state governments and $375 billion for local governments. The former number lines up with a recent report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a center-left think tank, which predicts a $500 billion state budget shortfall during the next three years. Those numbers are likely to be reduced in the final bill, and that's fine; for example, some of the local government spending is redundant because states use some of their budgets to support localities. But robust relief to state and local governments will help avoid one of the biggest mistakes of the Great Recession.
 A second important piece of the bill is more funding for test-and-trace efforts. Most of the U.S. still doesn't have enough testing or contact tracing to suppress future outbreaks of the virus. As a number of economists and public health experts have pointed out, these suppression capabilities offer the single highest return on investment that government spending can get right now. Test-and-trace systems are the essential tool used by New Zealand, South Korea and other countries that have contained COVID-19. With the threat of the virus in check, economic reopening will be safe from sudden reversals.
 When it comes to economic relief for households, though, the House bill could use some improvement. The bill's main approach is to double down on the strategies in the CARES Act -- modest one-time universal payments of $1,200 per person, plus a big extension of supersized unemployment-insurance benefits through the end of the year.
 This is a lot of money, which is good. But much more of it should be in the form of universal payments and less in the form of unemployment benefits. The main reason is that many unemployed Americans have had trouble accessing the benefits that the CARES Act allotted to them, and there's no reason to expect anything different in the coming months. State unemployment systems are not equipped to deal with the number or scale of the requests being made. So far, this has meant that a very large share of unemployed workers -- by some estimates, almost half -- have either been denied benefits or are still waiting.
 This is unacceptable. So far, workers either denied or forced to wait have been spending down their savings, but there's no way that can continue for the rest of 2020.
 If the government wants to both minimize human suffering and cushion the long- term blow to consumer demand, it should shift much of the relief effort away from the unemployment-insurance system and toward universal payments. Instead of a one-time payment of $1,200 per person, the relief bill should include recurring universal payments for the rest of the year. Because these payments are administered through the tax system, they're much quicker and more reliable than state unemployment checks. Also, because they're universal instead of based on employment status, these payments are less likely to deter workers from going back to work quickly once the pandemic threat has passed.
 The time for worrying about benefit targeting has passed. This depression is going to affect all Americans, and the solution is a relief bill that focuses more on supporting all Americans.

Jerry Waldrop, who has been a pastor at the church for 31 years, told WMC Action News that the church had "no idea" who would intentionally set fire to their building.
 "We’ve tacked our brains and we have no idea," Waldrop said. "No enemies that we know of. We don’t know anyone that we even think could be capable of doing something like this."
 According to the lawsuit, three Holly Springs police officers interrupted the church's Easter service and shut it down after it was held indoors due to inclement weather. On April 22, officers also shut down a Bible study that was attended by approximately 35 people inside the church. The church said all its members were practicing social distancing inside.
 However, the city's attorney, Shirley Byers, told WMC Action News that the church members were not practicing social distancing and were in violation of the city's initial stay-at-home order that did not include churches as essential businesses.
 Byers did not respond to a request for comment.
 The lawsuit noted that the while the statewide stay-at-home order issued by Gov. Tate Reeves counted churches as essential businesses, the city's order did not.  
 The city's order was later amended on April 24 to allow churches to conduct drive-in worship services in the parking lot during which congregants are required to remain in their vehicles with the car windows closed or slightly cracked open.
 "It is very clear local municipalities can have guidelines that are more strict than the governor’s guidelines, but they cannot have guidelines that directly conflict with what we have put in place,” Reeves said at a news conference Wednesday.
 In response to the church's lawsuit, US District Judge Michael P. Mills issued an order saying that "for obvious reasons" the court was "less sympathetic" to the church for holding an indoor service with at least 35 congregants, citing the example of how the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea was traced to religious services held by a single church.
 "While particular church members may decide that meeting their spiritual needs warrant accepting the risk of attending religious services, it is a very different matter for them to argue that members of the public should accept risks to their own lives, and those of their family members, arising from others’ exercise of their religion," the judge wrote in the order.
 Mills also said the church's claim that its members practiced social distancing during the indoor service was "a hollow guarantee," given how difficult it is to police meetings behind closed doors and the uncertainty in determining what "a safe COVID-19 distance" is among individuals sitting together in the same room for an hour or more.
 Mills wrote that while the city's ordinance was "inartfully drafted" and "vague," its enforcement of the ordinance was "reasonable."
 He did not issue a temporary restraining order against the city, stating that the city had assured the court it would revise its ordinance to include drive- in church services.
 While Mills acknowledged that a drive-in service was a "reasonable accommodation," he warned that it was not "risk-free," especially for elderly parishioners who would require the assistance of friends or nonresident family members to drive them to the service.
 "It is well known that the COVID-19 virus disproportionately kills elderly individuals, and it may therefore be assumed that, if the holding of such 'drive-in' services becomes a nationwide trend, that a significant (and possibly large) number of deaths will result," Mills said in the order.
 Crampton said that he has appealed the district court's refusal to grant an expedited hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction against the city and hopes to get a ruling before Sunday.

The decision to cancel the 2020 Greene County Fair was a “very difficult” choice to make for the event’s board of directors, but it was made with the community’s safety as the foremost concern, according to its president.
 “It was a tough decision,” Rick Clark, president of the Greene County Fair board of directors, said Wednesday. “We met last night for our regularly scheduled meeting. And it was time that we had to make a call.”
 While it was a challenging decision, Clark said the board felt it was the correct one for the community due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “We felt it was in the best interest of protecting the community to cancel the fair,” he said.
 If social distancing and other restrictions are eased later in the year, the board hopes to be able to schedule some individual events related to the fair.
 “We will see what the future holds for the fall,” Clark said. “We may be able to do some one-off events, such as a ‘Demolition Derby’ weekend if some of the social distancing restrictions are lifted. It depends on what happens in the future with the pandemic. But, hopefully, we can have a few events for the community later in the year.”
 Planning had been going on for months for the annual fair, scheduled for July 27 through Aug. 2 this year, Clark said.
 In early April, much of the public side of the fair is organized as vendors are contacted to make final preparations for the event, he explained.
 With the coronavirus pandemic, this spring has been different as those final preparations and calls were delayed to see what would happen with the restrictions that are in place.
 However, at the May meeting, the board felt it was time to make a decision about whether to go on with the fair or cancel it, Clark said.
 The board has been in contact with several officials throughout the pandemic, particularly the Tennessee Commissioner of Agriculture, he said. State agriculture officials indicated that while some restrictions have been relaxed with the economy reopening, they felt that social distancing guidelines would be in place for the foreseeable future.
 Social distancing restrictions were a major factor in the board’s decision, Clark said.
 “A fair does not lend itself to social distancing at all,” he said. “Imagine trying to social distance about 3,500 people in the demolition derby area or on the midway where people are usually shoulder to shoulder on busy nights when events like the derby are scheduled. At the food booths, it would be difficult as people are used to sitting with their neighbors and their friends. It would even be difficult in the commercial building with the flow of people.”
 Greene County is not alone in struggling with what to do about its fair. Information available from the Tennessee Association of Fairs earlier this week indicated seven fairs across the state have been canceled and 13 have not made a final decision, Clark said.
 Ten fairs across the state are continuing as scheduled. However, he said, many of those are in West Tennessee and will be held later in the year than many of those that have been canceled.
 With the cancellation of the fair, the board’s focus will now be on making preparations for the 2021 event.
 A date has not yet been finalized for next year, Clark said, but the board is looking at the fair beginning in late July.
 The timing of the fair was moved up a few weeks in 2019 to late July, and the board felt that it was a positive move for the event.
 “We had a problem for several years with the fair coinciding with the start of school,” he said. “We had an opportunity to move the fair up earlier last year, and it was a huge success. We had better attendance and we did have good weather.”
