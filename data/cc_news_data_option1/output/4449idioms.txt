Rescuers pulled two children from the rubble in a town in Turkey on Monday, delivering hope nearly three days after a major earthquake hit the Aegean, killing 93 people and ruining dozens of buildings.
 Three-year-old Elif Perincek was rescued 65 hours after the 7.0-magnitude quake left a trail of destruction in western Turkey and eastern Greece on Friday, Turkey's AFAD emergency authority said.
 Local media showed a video of a little girl wrapped up in a foil blanket quickly taken to safety in the coastal town of Bayrakli -- the hardest hit by the disaster -- as rescue workers broke into applause.
 Hours later, Turkish state television showed images of the girl, her right eye closed by a purple bruise, waving to the camera from her hospital bed, a doll resting on her chest.
 Muammer Celik, a fireman who found and saved Elif, told AFP he thought the toddler was dead when he saw her lying on her back, covered by white dust.
 "I asked for a body bag. I wanted to wipe the dust from her face and put out my hand towards her -- and then suddenly she grabbed my thumb," he recalled.
 "We froze. We were crying with joy," Celik said. "We forgot everything in that moment!"
 A photo of Elif holding Celik's hand went viral in Turkey. The fireman said she did not let go until she was taken to a tent for safety nearby.
 Elif was the 106th person pulled out alive from collapsed buildings in Bayrakli and surrounding towns and cities in western Turkey.
 Her mother and three siblings were pulled out on Saturday night, although her rescued brother later died, the TRT state broadcaster said.
 \- Rising toll -
 AFAD also reported the rescue of 14-year-old Idil Sirin in Bayrakli, 58 hours after the quake hit.
 But the Sirin family's joy was brief as the lifeless body of Idil's sister, Ipek, was found, the Hurriyet newspaper reported.
 "I can't hear any sounds from my sister, she's dead," Idil told rescuers as she was being pulled out, Hurriyet said.
 Turkey's toll from the quake is continuing to rise, with AFAD reporting 91 dead.
 Nearly 1,000 people were injured and more than 150 were still in hospital.
 Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that 10 of the wounded were in intensive care, including three in a critical condition.
 Two teenagers were also killed on their way home from school on the Greek island of Samos, near the epicentre of the quake.
 \- 'Can anyone hear me?'-
 Racing against time, rescue workers were pressing ahead with their desperate search for survivers in western Turkey more than 72 hours after disaster struck.
 "Can anyone hear me," one rescue worker cried through a megaphone down into the rubble.
 "If you can, hit something or scream," he called as a drone hovered overhead scanning the rubble.
 Thousands of residents, including those with destroyed homes, spent a third night outside in tents in Bayrakli and in nearby Bornova, many fearing the risk of aftershocks.
 Turkish authorities registered 1,286 repeat tremors by Monday afternoon -- including 43 above magnitude four -- complicating the rescuers' works and raising the threat of further damage.
 Launching an investigation into why 58 buildings were either heavily damaged or completely destroyed, Turkish police detained nine people -- including contractors -- in connection with the quake, state news agency Anadolu said.

Any reasonable person would have sent observers to see what was going on in northern Italy, note mistakes and soak up frontline experience to then pass it on in emergency briefings. In Bergamo, for instance, clinicians reflected on how to prepare for the next outbreak. Their view was that focussing on hospitals was the wrong way to manage the outbreak. They reported that an epidemic requires a change of perspective toward a concept of community-centred care. This meant that the majority of cases could be dealt with without people being admitted to hospital and instead be treated at home, and that only in the worst instances would someone be admitted.

In einer beherzten Rede spricht sich Generalstabschef Helmuth von Moltke am 23. Juni 1873 im Reichstag in Berlin in seiner Rolle als Abgeordneter gegen den Bau des Nord-Ostsee-Kanals aus. Das Wort des genialen Militärstrategen und verdienstvollen Heeresreformers des Kaiserreichs hat Gewicht - und so lehnt Berlin das Kanal-Projekt zunächst ab. Denn von Moltke verfolgt andere Pläne, will die stark in die Jahre gekommenen Flotten mit Panzerschiffen in Ost- und Nordsee stärken. Sein Bestandsplan bei der deutschen Flotte listet seinerzeit nur noch fünf Schiffe auf. Obwohl Reichskanzler Otto von Bismarck mit seinem Wunsch nach einer neuen Wasserstraße vorrangig das militärisch-strategische Argument betont, findet er ausgerechnet in dem Generalfeldmarschall seinen größten Widersacher. Und so steht von Moltkes "Flottengründungsplan" in Konkurrenz mit von Bismarcks Kanal-Plänen.

Ahead of US elections, surging virus cases and in light of a fresh lockdown in England, you would have thought the markets would be lower today. Well, that’s how things started with stock index futures gapping lower overnight, crude oil dropping 4% and the pound slipping to its lowest level since early October. However, things then started to turn around sharply and by mid-morning UK time, it was a sea of green for the major indices, while crude oil had trimmed its losses and the GBP/USD had nearly turned positive on the day.

“Chris checks all the boxes,” Bowers said. “He has developed into one of the great leaders of our company.”


  Womack said getting units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle up and running will be a top priority. Approved by the PSC in 2009, the project has been plagued with extensive cost overruns and lengthy delays caused in part by the bankruptcy of prime contractor Westinghouse.


  However, Georgia Power has doggedly pursued completing the first new nuclear project to be built in the U.S. in decades, even as other utilities gave up after encountering technical problems with the next-generation Westinghouse AP1000 reactors.


  Unit 3 is due to go into service in November of next year, and Unit 4 is expected to follow one year later.


  “Based on current projections, we will have [Unit 3] online a couple of months early,” Bowers said.


  Bowers joined Southern Company in 1979 at Gulf Power and has served as Georgia Power’s chairman, president and CEO for the past 11 years.

WESTPORT -- He is 21-years old and is running against an incumbent state representative who has served for the last 10 years.


  For Evan Gendreau, those qualities would be an asset to the communities he would represent: Westport, Fall River, New Bedford and Freetown.


  Gendreau, a Republican and a Westport resident, on Nov. 3 will vie for a seat held by fellow Westporter and state Rep. Paul Schmid, a Democrat.


  Gendreau said he continually fields frustrated comments over how local legislators are voting and representing their constituents.


  Gendreau also notes that the 8th Bristol District has not had a Republican on the ballot since 1996.


  A Umass Dartmouth student majoring in political science, Gendreau said he offers a new and fresh perspective.


  Gendreau is also a research assistant at the Public Policy Center in Dartmouth and in 2018 worked on the campaign of former United States Senate candidate Geoff Diehl.


  "I'm running because our district deserves a new voice at the State House. We are facing unprecedented times with a high unemployment rate and many small businesses in our community that are struggling to remain open," Gendreau said in a recent email.


  "Unfortunately, there are many seats that go unopposed in the state legislature, and the last time a Republican was on the ballot in this district was 1996. The residents of Westport, Fall River, New Bedford, and Freetown deserve a choice in this election, especially with so many pressing issues at stake," he added in the email.


  Gendreau attended Fall River and Westport public schools. Citing his recent experience within these local school districts, Gendreau says he has a unique understanding of their challenges.


  Along with advocating for education, Gendreau says he will also advocate for public safety and small businesses.


  He has said that he will oppose legislation aiming to diminish police personnel. Instead, he will lobby Beacon Hill for more support for police, fire, and emergency medical services.


  "I will stand up for fiscally responsible policies that will help grow the local economy, including a lower tax and regulatory burden to help small businesses and working families. Additionally, I will support measures aimed at increasing government accountability and transparency," Gendreau said.


  Gendreau noted on his campaign page that local aid over the years has been reduced by 40 percent since 2001. That aid, he said, would help with road construction and maintenance, school systems while also promoting economic growth.


  Gendreau said he would actively seek development and growth opportunities.


  "Our community has a lot of potential and, as state representative, I will work to capitalize on these opportunities, particularly with education and workforce development," Gendreau said.

The Covid-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for the growth of the Indian data centre industry is expected to boom with an annual growth rate of 25-30% to reach $4.5-5 billion by fiscal 2025, a study by CRISIL Research showed. “The crisis accelerated the transition to the digital medium as almost all aspects of daily life – be it banking, education, or shopping – switched to the digital medium almost instantaneously, leading to a boom in India’s digital ecosystem,” the ratings firm said in a report. The upshot has been an exponential growth in data generation, and this has created unparalleled demand for data centres in India, it added. According to CRISIL, on account of Covid, the data consumption has seen a sharp 38% rise on-year in the first quarter of this fiscal. “Industry capacity, which stood at ~360MW in fiscal 2020, is expected to expand more than threefold to reach 1,100-1,200 MW by fiscal 2025 on the back of $4-5 billion investments announced over the past three years for both brownfield and greenfield expansion of projects,” it said. CRISIL said the data centre expansion will be supported by growth in data volumes to support high growth in e-commerce, increase in usage of social media, greater preference for over the top (OTT) platforms, the government’s impetus to the Digital India initiative and rapid digitalisation of services across industries (Industry 4.0 and 5G). The data centre industry has been largely concentrated in top 4 cities, with Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai accounting for ~60% of total sites. In terms of number of players too the industry is highly concentrated. The top 11 players account for more than 70% of the total revenue because of the high initial capex required to set up infrastructure and long payback period, CRISIL said.

Será una fiesta completa para Diego Armando Maradona. Su cumpleaños 60 y la vuelta del fútbol argentino lo encontrará en una cancha. Tras haber recibido el ok de su médico, el entrenador de Gimnasia estará en el Bosque en la presentación del Lobo ante Patronato desde las 19.La incertidumbre acerca de la presencia o no de Diego en el primer partido de su equipo se había incrementado en las últimas horas luego de que una persona de su entorno con la que había tenido contacto el domingo presentara síntomas compatibles con los de coronavirus. A partir de esto, Leopoldo Luque, médico personal, aclaró que Maradona continuaría respetando el aislamiento en su casa de Brandsen y que de ser necesario sería hisopado.En las últimas horas el panorama se fue despejando y llegaron las buenas noticias. Como el test de PCR de su empleado dio negativo y Diego no presentó ningún síntoma, las condiciones estaban dadas para que cumpla su deseo y pueda estar en la cancha de Gimnasia el día de su cumpleaños.Por la mañana del viernes y antes participar de un acto solidario en Villa Palito en el marco de la campaña “Las 10 del 10”, Matías Morla, abogado y amigo del campeón del mundo, fue hasta el country de Brandsen para saludarlo por su aniversario y coordinar una jornada que asoma muy emotiva y plagada de homenajes.En esa línea, una variada selección de deportistas le envió saludos que fueron recopilados en un video publicado en las redes sociales de Diego y que quedará para la historia.La jornada de cumpleaños arrancó con saludos desde todas las latitudes. Desde sus hijas a los futbolistas más destacados. Pero sobre el mediodía un llamado telefónico lo sorprendió gratamente a Diego. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner se comunicó con el Diez y mantuvieron un diálogo cordial con elogios mutuos.Muchas fueron las muestras de apoyo de Maradona al kirchnerismo, primero cuando era Néstor el presidente y luego bajo el mandato de Cristina. También para marcar distancia con la ideología y las políticas de Mauricio Macri.El último guiño se dio con motivo del Día de la Lealtad peronista, cuando Diego publicó en sus redes sociales un contundente apoyo al gobierno nacional. “Mi viejo fue peronista, mi vieja adoraba a Evita, y yo fui, soy, y seré́ siempre peronista. Y esto no debería ser un problema. El problema es la intolerancia que nos plantaron. Por eso, Feliz Día de la Lealtad Peronista. Todo mi apoyo a Alberto Fernández, Cristina Kirchner, Martín Guzmán, Axel Kicillof y Ginés González García, los banco a morir. Y seamos tolerantes, argentinos. Mantengamos la pasión por nuestras convicciones, sean las que sean, pero con respeto”, escribió Diego.MFV

  However, almost all agreed that young people today will not have a better quality of life than their parents: just 6% said otherwise. The current generation of 65-74-year-olds was the last to report a feeling that their life had been clearly better than that of their predecessors.


  18-24-year-olds reported a bleak picture, with 42% saying they lacked confidence in life. It’s not that they were particularly dissatisfied with the present, the report noted, but rather they were worried about future scenarios, especially climate and environmental change.

During the September-end quarter, First Majestic recorded consolidated production of 5.2 million silver equivalent ounce, comprising 3.2 million ounces of silver and 25,771 ounces of gold. Silver and gold production increased 72% and 63% sequentially, respectively, aided by impressive operating performances across its three mines.      Gold prices have been up 23.6% so far this year, fueled by the coronavirus pandemic and rate cuts. Silver prices have also flared up 32.7%, year to date. Given that industrial applications account for 60% of the global silver consumption, the slowdown in industrial activity amid the pandemic had earlier thwarted demand for the white metal. Lately, silver has been gaining on the back of recovery in industrial activity as governments continue relaxing the restrictions. Higher production numbers, and rising gold and silver prices, during the third quarter are likely to have aided the company’s third-quarter performance.
