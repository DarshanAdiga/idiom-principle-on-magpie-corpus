The New England Patriots played a crucial role in securing 1.2 million N95 masks from China for healthcare workers in Massachusetts on Wednesday.
 Andrew Beaton of The Wall Street Journal documented the operation, which began with Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker striking a deal to get masks from China, but needing a way to bring them to the US.
 Team owner Robert Kraft and his son and team president, Jonathan, who is also the chairman of the board at Massachusetts General Hospital, lent the Patriots' team plane, a Boeing 767 passenger plane.
 But the logistics grew more complicated. They had to get permission to land the plane in Shenzhen, China, so Baker, the US State Department, and Robert Kraft stepped in, according to Beaton. To avoid having to go into quarantine for 14 days, only the necessary flight crew was allowed on board, and they had to stay on the plane while the plane was grounded in Shenzhen.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) ‚Äì Gov. Andy Beshear will hold another conference call with Kentucky school superintendents Thursday afternoon, potentially signaling a longer suspension of in-person classes as the state tries to limit the spread of COVID-19.
 Beshear has hinted in recent days that an announcement regarding school closures will come soon, and his office asked the Kentucky Department of Education to set up another conference call with superintendents, according to Toni Konz Tatman, the department‚Äôs interim communications director.
 The call is scheduled for Thursday afternoon, she told WDRB News.
 The last time Beshear held a conference call with superintendents on March 20, he announced a two-week extension of his original recommendation for schools to cease in-person classes.
 Beshear said Wednesday that an announcement on schools would be coming soon given President Donald Trump's recent extension of federal public health guidelines to April 30.
 "If we make a move, it would likely be similar to what the president did and extend it a couple more weeks," the governor said during his Wednesday COVID-19 update.
 Beshear said he wanted to ensure "that we still at least have the opportunity for kids to go back to school this year," though he conceded that classes may not reopen to in-person instruction for the rest of the 2019-20 school year.
 "I do think it is more than in the realm of possibility that there won't be anymore in-person classes in school this year," he said Wednesday. "We've got to at least be prepared for it, and I know our superintendents have been making those preparations if that is the case."
 He‚Äôs currently asked schools to keep their doors closed and transition to non- traditional instruction until April 20, though Kevin Brown, Kentucky‚Äôs interim education commissioner, said districts should prepare enough distance learning material to last through May 1.
 Districts have adhered to Beshear‚Äôs guidance in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and Brown has said all are offering food service for students who are learning from home for an extended period of time.
 Schools can also request as many non-traditional days as they need thanks to Senate Bill 177, which also allows districts to give employees 30 days of emergency leave during the COVID-19 outbreak and request waivers from the state if they can‚Äôt hit the minimal 1,062 instructional hours by June 12.
 Brown has given school districts blanket approval for 30 additional remote learning days, which are typically capped at 10 days.
 At Jefferson County Public Schools, the district is taking requests from families who receive free or reduced-price lunch or have children in special education programs for Chromebooks. Kentucky‚Äôs largest district plans to distribute 25,000 Chromebooks as it transitions to non-traditional instruction next week.
 Special needs households can also receive hotspots with unlimited data through a contract with T-Mobile that JCPS Superintendent Marty Pollio announced Wednesday. More than 6,000 hotspots are available.

The lack of a unified, 50-state response also collides with evidence emerging that coronavirus infections are being spread by people who have no clear symptoms, complicating efforts to gain control of the pandemic. A study conducted by researchers in Singapore and published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday is the latest to estimate that around 10% of new coronavirus infections may be spread by people who were infected with the virus but not experiencing symptoms.
 Even while deferring to governors. the Trump administration has issued guidelines that have urged Americans to work from home if possible, cancel on- site instruction at schools and avoid large gatherings. The resistance to a more robust response comes even as Vice President Mike Pence said White House models for the coronavirus toll show the country on a trajectory akin to hard- hit Italy.
 Speaking to CNN, Pence said, ‚ÄúWe think Italy may be the most comparable area to the United States at this point." Italy, which has already recorded more than 13,000 deaths, has issued a nationwide quarantine, shutting down almost all industrial production and offices and largely prohibiting residents from leaving their homes. The U.S. has recorded more than 5,000 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
 The White House's best-case projection for loss of life assumes statewide stay-at-home orders, according to a senior administration official familiar with Trump's thinking. Trump, the official said, is a believer in federalism and that it is up to governors to set restrictions for their states. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.
 More than 285 million people live in the 40 states where governors have declared statewide shelter-in-place orders or have recommended that residents stay home. In other states ‚Äî places like Iowa and Nebraska, among others ‚Äî governors have resisted state-level decisions, but some localities have declared residents should stay at home.

According to a poll published Wednesday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 78% of U.S. adults, including 84% of Democrats and 76% of Republicans, favor requiring Americans to stay in their homes except for essential errands. Americans in states that already had stay-at- home orders in place when the survey began are more likely than those in states that did not to approve of their state's response, 63% to 51%.
 Still, Trump ‚Äî who has conducted long, near-daily briefings on his administration‚Äôs response to the virus outbreak over the last three weeks ‚Äî has been reluctant to use his bully pulpit to urge governors to issue orders that would help effectively create a national quarantine.
 ‚ÄúThere are some states that are different,‚Äù Trump told reporters Wednesday. ‚ÄúThere are some states that don't have much of a problem.‚Äù
 But there are signs that Trump administration officials are pushing behind the scenes for holdout governors to issue statewide quarantines.
 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had resisted issuing a statewide order but reversed course and issued one Wednesday as federal and local pressure mounted for him to abandon the county-by-county approach he had implemented.
 DeSantis, a Republican, told reporters that he decided to issue the order after consulting with Trump and White House advisers.
 Rep. Donna Shalala, a Florida Democrat, said earlier Wednesday that Trump should be pressing governors for a unified approach to help stem the spread of the disease, calling his response so far ‚Äúfragmented, weak and uneven.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt made a national plea to say we‚Äôre all in this together, and he hasn‚Äôt even talked to the governors about all doing the same thing,‚Äù Shalala, who was secretary of health and human services under President Bill Clinton, said in an interview.
 Authority to order quarantines inside states rests almost entirely with states under provisions in the U.S. Constitution ceding power not explicitly delegated to the federal government to states, courts have ruled consistently for years. While the federal government itself can‚Äôt order nationwide quarantines or impose quarantines on states, courts have said it has clear power under constitutional clauses regulating commerce to quarantine international travelers or those traveling state to state who might be carriers of deadly diseases.

Face Shield Initiative STL is a group of St. Louis volunteer designers, fabricators and doctors developing facemasks for local EMTs, nurses and doctors      By Brett Auten      The fight against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) is continuing on several fronts.      Inventor Forge Makerspace, located in the Economic Development Center (EDC) of St. Charles County Incubator, is helping lead a regional effort to help the medical community defend themselves while trying to heal those who are afflicted with the highly-contagious virus.      Emily Elhoffer and David Cervantes helped organize Face Shield Initiative STL, a group of St. Louis volunteer designers, fabricators and doctors researching and developing designs to provide facemasks for local EMTs, nurses and doctors. Face Shield Initiative STL has been working closely with Barnes- Jewish Hospital to provide alternate sources for much-needed medical supplies.      Currently, there are around 30 community members who are voluntarily running 3D printers to help build small batch supplies for face shields. Along with Inventor Forge, two other makerspaces (MADE Makerspace and Arch Reactor) are assisting with the hands-on manufacturing needs.      Over the weekend, Inventor Forge delivered 50 headbands and 175 face shields to Doctor Madhu Kancherla at Mercy Hospital. Dr. Kancherla said the plan is to donate the face shields to the ICU staff at Mercy. Dr. Kancherla, a heart specialist who has lived in St. Louis for over 20 years reached out to Inventor Forge. He stressed that there are some very sick patients in the Mercy hospitals for which, the health care workers, need better protection at Mercy South Hospital and the main Mercy Hospital, especially for the frontline doctors and nurses working in our Intensive Care Units.      ‚ÄúWhen we found out about (Face Shield Initiative STL) we were like, 'Let's do this,'‚Äù Inventor Forge member Luke Offner, a St. Peters resident, said. ‚ÄúWe were all on Slack (a chat room app) talking and sharing ideas. It just snowballed from there.‚Äù      Inventor Forge is a nonprofit group of makers, inventors, artists and free thinkers in the St. Charles area who actively support STEM and STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Arts and Math) initiatives and provides classes in as many areas of STEAM it can support.      ‚ÄúThese are all volunteers with a goal of delivering 300 masks,‚Äù Inventor Forge member Luke Offner said. ‚ÄúAfter that, we will see what else they need us to do.‚Äù      Inventor Forge Makerspace serves as a creative ideas lab and creation space for any age. It is a membership-based shared space where hobbyists, professionals, novices, and all of those in-between can come to imagine and create both individually and together using woodworking to laser cutting, programming electronics to 3D-Printing.      Printer operators include George Fetters, Doug Vaugn, Bill Plemmons, Gary Liming, Adam Scearce, Eric Bowman, Carl Schoeneberg, and Josh Medley. Laser operators include Greg Buescher James Kantor, and Plemmons. Supplies (including bags, bands, and labels: Offner and George Fetters.      After a flurry of Zoom conference calls, laser cut-prototypes, and other quick-turnarounds, Face Shield Initiative STL has been working around the clock, and out of pocket. All donated funds are used to help this jump-started organization pay for materials (PETG sheets and filament, PLA filament, and more) and administrative needs (website, utilities) as it evolves.      Starting last week, Cervantes began corralling all the local resources he could for 3D printing and fabrication. Between the volunteer leaders at MADE Makerspace, Inventor Forge, and Arch Reactor, they banded together to hammer out a working small-scale design and manufacturing operation to make the much- needed medical face shields for healthcare professionals.      Face Shield Initiative STL has amassed over $4,000 in material costs, and plan to order more materials in the coming weeks. For more information on Face Shield Initiative, visit its GoFundMe page.

A former administration official says Bolton "immediately sent a letter confirming receipt [of the Warren and Murray letter]. Ambassador Bolton was always eager to speak with any member of Congress and he did so regularly. Senator Warren (nor her staff) never contacted the NSC to facilitate a further discussion, either at the staff or principal level." A Warren spokeswoman notes, "The response she was looking for was for the White House to appoint someone to manage global health security risks. And as we know, unfortunately, that never happened." (Bolton was also under fire recently for declining to testify during the House impeachment hearings‚Äîwhile saving his story for a profitable tell-all book. He did signal he would testify at the Senate impeachment trial of Trump, if subpoenaed. Bolton, who was not subpoenaed, reportedly was prepared to say that Trump had told him he had pressured the Ukrainian president to initiate political investigations that would help Trump.)

Netflix Inc led rivals YouTube, Amazon Prime and Disney+ with over 59 million installs in the first quarter of 2020, but more time was spent on YouTube's Kids service as usage boomed following the shutdown of thousands of schools in March.
 YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc's Google, collected $110 million in in-app spending during the same time period, the highest among major streaming apps globally, according to a report by analytics firms Apptopia and Braze.
 The report did not give actual hours of usage, but ranked YouTube Kids first, followed by Netflix. YouTube itself was in third place.
 The report also showed that Amazon.com Inc's game streaming platform Twitch was also among the most downloaded mobile apps globally, gathering nearly $20 million in user spending in the same period.
 Riot Games' online battle title "League of Legends" is currently the most watched game on the platform, according to TwitchMetrics, which tracks the popularity of games on the platform.
 The coronavirus pandemic, and the resulting move across the world towards working from home, has driven a boom in usage of online gaming, streaming and communications, putting pressure on streaming companies' infrastructure and speed.
 Zoom Video Communications Inc said late on Wednesday that its daily users had ballooned to more than 200 million in March from a maximum last year of 10 million.

On March 12, the Canton High boys hockey team laced up the skates at Canton Ice House for one of their final practices before the Division 2 state championship game. The Bulldogs, losers of just a single game over the last two seasons, had revenge on their minds.


  Canton was just a few days away from a highly anticipated TD Garden date with Lincoln-Sudbury, the lone team to outduel the Bulldogs in an astonishing 51 combined games over the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons.


  Canton's talented group of seniors never took the ice again.


  At the tail end of practice that Thursday evening, Canton athletic director Danny Erickson got together with boys coach Brian Shuman and girls hockey coach Dennis Aldrich to deliver the bad news -- amid the worsening coronavirus pandemic, the MIAA was canceling the rest of the winter sports season and declaring all state finalists in both hockey (the Canton girls were in their Div. 2 state championship game, too) and basketball to be co-champs of their respective divisions.


  The boys players could see Erickson talking to Shuman and they knew what was happening by the sad look on their coach's face.


  Shuman broke the news to the team after what he called their most "competitive practice of the year" getting ready for the Warriors.


  "I've talked to teams after losing in overtime in the playoffs, I've talked to teams after some heartbreaking losses of people in the community," said Shuman. "This is like nothing I've ever had to do before. And they took it as expected. They took it very, very hard."


  More than 10 days after getting the news, the Canton players were still devastated that they did not get a chance at revenge. Senior captain Tommy Ghostlaw was hurt the first time the Bulldogs played Lincoln-Sudbury -- a 6-4 L-S win at the Ice House on Feb. 12 that snapped Canton's 43-game unbeaten streak (40-0-3) -- and desperately wanted to make a difference in the rematch.


  "Just watching it all unfold, it stung to watch, but we were hoping" we would see them again, said Ghostlaw. "Some guys in the (handshake) line were saying, 'We'll see you later, we'll see you later,' like at the Garden. And it all came true. Our whole team was so hyped up to play them. We were ready to go. Obviously, it didn't work out with all this stuff going on. But we really wanted that game and we were hoping to see them back at the Garden."


  "Everyone was just shocked and couldn't breathe," senior Chris Lavoie, the team's leading goal scorer, said of his reaction to the state final being scrapped. "We didn't think it was real. It was crazy."


  "I think obviously everyone was devastated when they told us we couldn't play," senior captain Timmy Kelleher said. "Obviously, we were sad because the season ended, but (it also stung) not being able to prove that we were the best team again, prove it further in that game."


  Despite the disappointment for several of the Bulldogs players, they agreed that the decision was the right one to make.


  "I think at the end of the day, you know, people's safety is a priority in everything," said Kelleher. "But I think just every game you've got to play like it is your last. Because every game could really be (your last)."


  "One of the things a coach says, I guess, is control what you can control," senior defenseman Owen Lehane noted. "And we really can't control the spread of the virus going around right now. We could just control how we played, how we prepared for the game."


  In the future, Shuman hopes that his team will be able to look past this and remember the memories they did share. This year, the 2010 state championship team had a reunion party. He said the party was all about the memories they had during the season, the practices, the locker room, the team dinners, rather than the final game against Newburyport.


  He said his current group of devastated players will soon come to the realization that the memories are what high school sports are all about. Ghostlaw is already getting a sense of what Shuman hopes all of his players will feel in the future.


  "Just (realizing) that not everything can go your way sometimes," Ghostlaw said about what he learned from the game being canceled. "Even though bad things happen, you just have to realize that, looking back in the past couple years, playing hockey with these guys has been the best time of my life. It's not all about playing, it is about team dinners, spending time with your friends and just having an absolute blast being with them every day."


  Weeks later, the cancellation of the state final remains a tough pill to swallow for Canton. Even Shuman acknowledged that it is tough to miss out on the normal closure -- either the acceptance of a tough loss, or the joy of celebrating on the Garden ice as champions.


  "When you put that much intensity and that much emotion and that much passion into an entire season," said Shuman, "to have it end abruptly without really any control at all is difficult. It really is."

The system did not simply automate the manual process of one user looking up the name of another participant on LinkedIn during a Zoom meeting. In tests conducted last week, The Times found that even when a reporter signed in to a Zoom meeting under pseudonyms ‚Äî ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am not here‚Äù ‚Äî the data- mining tool was able to instantly match him to his LinkedIn profile. In doing so, Zoom disclosed the reporter‚Äôs real name to another user, overriding his efforts to keep it private.
 Reporters also found that Zoom automatically sent participants‚Äô personal information to its data-mining tool even when no one in a meeting had activated it. This week, for instance, as high school students in Colorado signed in to a mandatory video meeting for a class, Zoom readied the full names and email addresses of at least six students ‚Äî and their teacher ‚Äî for possible use by its LinkedIn profile-matching tool, according to a Times analysis of the data traffic that Zoom sent to a student‚Äôs account.
 The discoveries about Zoom‚Äôs data-mining feature echo what users have learned about the surveillance practices of other popular tech platforms over the last few years. The video-meeting platform that has offered a welcome window on American resiliency during the coronavirus ‚Äî providing a virtual peek into colleagues‚Äô living rooms, classmates‚Äô kitchens and friends‚Äô birthday celebrations ‚Äî can reveal more about its users than they may realize.
 ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt know this is happening and that‚Äôs just completely unfair and deceptive,‚Äù Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial- Free Childhood, a nonprofit group in Boston, said of the data-mining feature. He added that storing the personal details of school children for nonschool purposes, without alerting them or obtaining a parent‚Äôs permission, was particularly troubling.
 Early Thursday morning, after Times reporters contacted Zoom and LinkedIn with their findings on the profile-matching feature, the companies said they would disable the service.

New Delhi, Apr 2 (PTI) Industry body Assocham on Thursday urged the government to roll out a USD 100-120 billion stimulus package to help revive all sectors of the economy, which has been battered by the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent nationwide lockdown.
 Stressing that the Reserve Bank's decision on key policy rate cut and measures to infuse liquidity could just be seen as a "quick short term fix", Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said the government would need to do much more in the immediate future.
 "This could include the central government making use of the current scenario, wherein the gloom of deflation as well as recession, and no threat of inflation hovers around the economy, to take advantage of the prevailing fiscal deficit present in the financial system, and put together a stimulus package of about USD 100 to 120 billion that is sure to help revive all sectors in the country," Sood said.
 India also stands to gain around USD 50 billion in fuel import bill due to the fall in global crude prices, he said in a statement.
 According to the chamber, the government may go in for temporary suspension of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Rules (FRBM) Act.
 The legislation, enacted way back in August 2003, was passed with the aim to make the central government responsible for ensuring ''inter-generational equity in fiscal management and long-term macro-economic stability''.
 "This move needs to be carried out to ensure that administrators within the current government at the centre, maintains the nation's finance with regards to revenue and expenditure in an organized manner, so the future generation does not inherit the burden of dealing with unsustainably high levels of debts," Sood said.
 Assocham further said during this nationwide lockdown, it is the vulnerable sections that are bound to suffer the most.
 Under such circumstances, they need to be provided with financial support in the form of an appropriate monetary package without the government reeling under the cloud of the FRBM Act, it added.
 On measures taken by the RBI, Sood said while those are appreciated, "I certainly believe that it may not be enough in the long run."

A few things. First off, use Ryzen Master for monitoring on those. Secondly, the voltage behavior is actually normal. At stock settings these CPU's will sometimes pull upwards of 1.5v in order to hit their maximum boost clocks or to maintain a higher all core clock when fully loaded. They do this in bursts. It's perfectly safe and normal per AMD. I've seen this behavior out of the entire Ryzen 3000 series family on half a dozen boards. Clock speeds being inconsistent is also normal. Clock speeds on these processors are not static values. That's part of the controversy with regard to boost clocks as these CPU's rarely if ever achieve their advertised boost clocks.

Several weeks ago we began asking New England readers what they thought about the coronavirus outbreak, the government response, and what more should be done. Back then, talk of shutting schools and events was just beginning to circulate as we all struggled to determine just how big the threat is. There was, and still is, so much unknown about the virus.


  So much has changed in our day-to-day lives since that first question about the coronavirus. School districts throughout New England have closed. Restaurants and other service businesses are struggling to survive under restrictions designed to keep people safe. Public events have been canceled in large numbers and groups of any size are banned or discouraged.


  In the midst of this unprecedented and chaotic time, there have also been numerous signs of resilience and hope. Families are staying home together. Neighbors are reaching out to offer connection and assistance. Friends and families are gathering virtually to catch-up and comfort each other.


  Given this new reality, last week we suspended our usual opinion questions to ask about you. We wanted to know how you are doing, what adjustments you're making because of the coronavirus and what struggles you're facing. We also wanted to hear if you there were any unexpected silver linings related to coronavirus-related changes.


  Here's what you said.


  This week's question is about the economy and financial impact of the coronavirus. Has the coronavirus affected your family finances? What safety nets should be in place? Should government provide more (or less) assistance to those affected? How much responsibility lies with the corporations doing layoffs? Answer below or here. Responses will publish online on April 9. Suggest future #ConfabNE questions here.


  How are you adjusting to coronavirus-related threats and changes? What struggles are you facing? Are you finding any unexpected silver linings along the way?


  Although I live in Attleboro, I work at Holy Family Holy Name School in New Bedford, the first grade teacher. This is my first year as a teacher. When I took the job in August, I never imagined this even being a possibility. Most of the challenges I've been facing have been mental and emotional struggles, panicking over my students. I've had so many questions. Are they okay? Will they be able to progress to the next grade level? What about the students who I've worked so hard with this year to get them where they need to be, will this time away cause them to regress? How do I effectively teach online?


  However, with all my panic stricken thoughts, I have found several silver linings. The first being that this time away from school has really enabled me to appreciate my job that much more. Some days I would wake up and say to myself "I wish I didn't have to go to work today" (as I'm sure everyone does every once in a while). I will never again take that opportunity for granted. On Friday, my students and I were able to video chat via Google meets as an entire class. The looks on my students faces instantly brought joy to me. We said a prayer together, and the children talked with me and each other about how they were staying busy at home. When the call ended, my happiness lasted the entire weekend. If I have learned anything from this, it's to be grateful for what you have.

  My husband has been working in Italy since New Years, he is a location manager and scout for films. The studio sent him home almost 2 weeks ago now. He has been in self-quarantine and will be done with that tomorrow,. As we take care of my 93-year-old Aunt and do not want to take any chances. I am staying at her home with her and he is at our home alone. He is an amateur, self taught painter. He has been painting a new painting everyday since his quarantine and posting it on Facebook for me and all of our friends to see. He's getting really good and entertaining us at the same time. I drop off food and essentials to him on the patio table and talk in the phone, but he is READY to get out. We live in East Dennis, his name is Charlie Harrington, you can look up his posts on Facebook. It's been challenging for us both, but better safe, and not sorry!

  The greatest struggle for me has been the constancy of togetherness. I normally have several hours everyday to myself for uninterrupted work. I'm an artist and cannot work effectively when I'm interrupted repeatedly. My kids are usually pretty good about amusing themselves but my husband can't get out of his own way, let alone mine. My productivity is at a stand still. The silver lining is of course being able to learn new things about my children and the way they are at school. Apparently, my 8 year old really likes to learn how to say hello in different languages. My high school senior has been playing her trumpet for relaxation and my middle son knows way more about robots than he ever let on before.

  There are times in the history of the world, and each in our personal history, that we are faced with being alone - I call it all one. It is a time to study and know ourselves, especially our inner reality where emotions spring like seeds into flowers or bad dreams. It is a time to know ourselves and come to love ourselves, and learn to enjoy the powerful sense of emotions.

  My husband and I are working from home. Our dog can not go to daycare, so we are spending more time with him. I do not consider this a struggle at all right now. I do miss interacting with colleagues at work and having the ability to socialize with friends and family. The unexpected silver lining is that we are spending less money on going out to eat, gas for our cars and doggy daycare. I am also reminded of how good it is to have the ability to work at home. I am practicing being grateful for what I have (a paycheck) and trying not to focus on what I do not have (loss of freedom).

  I had a baby on March 9, 2020 and I also have a 2-year-old at home. We struggle everyday with keeping them both safe from infection. Newborns have no immune system and I'm absolutely petrified that they will get sick. I've only left home to go to the grocery store and I'm extremely careful. I really need to go to the store this week, but I feel that it gets riskier with each passing day. Putting all that gloom and doom aside, I am grateful every day that I get to spend every waking minute with my amazing family. We go outside everyday and play in the yard and they are getting 100% of my attention.

While sanitation workers and waste pickers are risking their lives daily and keeping the city clean despite the Covid-19 pandemic, residents are dumping garbage on the Katraj ghat road.
 The stretch on the Pune-Satara highway has turned into garbage dumping zone since the last few days. With the country under lockdown, people are spending time at home, but residents of Katraj are dumping garbage near the road.
 "Since the last one week, most of the ghat section has been stinking due to the garbage thrown on both sides of the road. I have seen people from nearby areas and Katraj throw garbage while passing through the ghat. As the ghat section doesn't comes under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) jurisdiction, many people go and throw their garbage there," said Rakesh Pangare, a resident of Katraj.
 When HT visited the ghat section it was found that the space was littered with not only household garbage, but also construction debris, thermocol waste, plastic materials, liquor bottles, among others.
 When contacted Dnyaneshwar Molak, Pune Municipal Corporation, solid waste management department head, said, "Though the Katraj ghat section doesn't comes under our jurisdiction, residents living in PMC limits should not throw garbage while passing the ghat section. Our PMC cleanliness workers are working round the clock to keep the city clean, and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) under whose jurisdiction the ghat section comes, have the responsibility of cleaning the garbage. They have plans to start a garbage processing plant for villages in that area which needs to be done."

Rome, Apr 2 (AFP) A first prisoner in Italy has died of coronavirus, a prison watchdog group said on Thursday, calling for more early releases of inmates from the country's overcrowded system.
 Two prison guards have died of the virus, and 19 inmates out of a total inmate population of 58,000 have tested positive, according to Italy's justice ministry.
 "The first prisoner death from COVID-19 confirms all our worries about the tragic consequences of a contagion within prisons," said prisoner rights group Antigone in a statement, without providing further details.
 Over 120 guards have tested positive, Antigone said. Italy has reported over 110,000 cases of coronavirus. More than 13,000 people have died, representing the world's highest death toll for coronavirus.
 Prisons, where small cells are often shared by three inmates, are a particular public health worry, especially since 67% of inmates have at least one already existing health condition, Antigone said.
 Pope Francis specifically mentioned prisoners during his prayer on Sunday, saying that coronavirus within the crowded prison system "could turn into a tragedy."
 Thousands of masks and gloves have been sent to prisons around the country after guards complained about being unprotected and untested.
 Also on Thursday, the justice ministry said that all prisoners and prison staff in the southern region of Campania would be tested beginning next week.
 Last month, Italy announced plans to release up to 3,000 low-risk inmates serving sentences of less than 18 months to house arrest to reduce overcrowding.
 But Antigone argued on Thursday that another 10,000 prisoners should be allowed to serve their sentences at home, including those with existing health conditions for which a coronavirus infection "could be fatal." (AFP)
