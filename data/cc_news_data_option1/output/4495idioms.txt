Election law experts said it is doubtful that courts would entertain a bid by Trump to stop the counting of ballots that were received before or on Election Day, or that any dispute a court might handle would change the trajectory of the race in closely fought states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.
 With vote-counting still underway in many states in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Trump made an appearance at the White House and declared victory against Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
 "This is a major fraud on our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we'll be going to the US Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop," he said.
 The Republican president did not provide any evidence to back up his claim of fraud or detail what litigation he would pursue at the Supreme Court.
 As of Wednesday afternoon, the election still hung in the balance. A handful of closely contested states could decide the outcome in the coming hours or days, as a large number of mail-in ballots cast amid the coronavirus pandemic appears to have drawn out the process.
 However, legal experts said that while there could be objections to particular ballots or voting and counting procedures, it was unclear if such disputes would determine the final outcome.
 Ned Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University, said on Twitter that the Supreme Court "would be involved only if there were votes of questionable validity that would make a difference, which might not be the case."
 Both Republicans and Democrats have amassed armies of lawyers ready to go to the mat in a close race. Biden's team includes Marc Elias, a top election attorney at the firm Perkins Coie, and former Solicitors General Donald Verrilli and Walter Dellinger. Trump's lawyers include Matt Morgan, the president's campaign general counsel, Supreme Court litigator William Consovoy, and Justin Clark, senior counsel to the campaign.
 Benjamin Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer, said on CNN that any attempt to toss out legally cast votes would likely "be viewed by any court including the Supreme Court as just a massive disenfranchisement that would be frowned upon." Ginsberg represented George W. Bush's presidential campaign in 2000 when the Supreme Court ended a recount in Bush's favour against Democrat Al Gore.
 Trump attorney Jenna Ellis on Wednesday defended Trump's bid to challenge the vote count and evaluate his legal options. "If we have to go through these legal challenges, that's not unprecedented," Ellis told Fox Business Network in an interview. "He wants to make sure that the election is not stolen."
 Bringing a case to federal court immediately was one possibility, she added, without giving further details. "We have all legal options on the table."
 The case closest to being resolved by the Supreme Court is an appeal currently pending before the justices in which Republicans are challenging a September ruling by Pennsylvania's top court allowing mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and received up to three days later to be counted.
 The Supreme Court previously declined to fast-track an appeal by Republicans. But three conservative justices left open the possibility of taking up the case again after Election Day.
 Even if the court were to take up the case and rule for Republicans, it may not determine the final vote in Pennsylvania, as the case only concerns mail- in ballots received after Nov. 3.
 In a separate Pennsylvania case filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Republicans have accused officials in suburban Montgomery County of illegally counting mail-in ballots early and also giving voters who submitted defective ballots a chance to re-vote.
 If Biden secures 270 electoral votes without needing Pennsylvania, the likelihood of a legal fight in that state diminishes in any case, legal experts said.
 And any challenge would also need to make its way through the usual court hierarchy.
 "I think the Court would summarily turn away any effort by the President or his campaign to short-circuit the ordinary legal process," said Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law.
 "Even Bush v. Gore went through the Florida state courts first."

A federal appeals court has allowed a Trump administration rule that would deny green cards to immigrants who use public benefits like food stamps to go back into effect while it considers the case.
 The Election Day development was the latest dizzying twist in a legal battle over the controversial rule that the Trump administration argues helps ensure those who are self-sufficient come to the country.
 On Monday, US District Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago struck down the rule and US Citizenship and Immigration Services stopped applying it to pending applications. Government attorneys appealed, and the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals put a hold on the ruling the next day, allowing the restrictions to take effect again.
 USCIS spokesman Matthew Bourke said on Wednesday that the agency would immediately restart applying the rule to pending cases, but not "re-adjudicate any applications or petitions that were approved" in light of Monday's decision.
   
   
 Under the Trump administration rule, officials can deny permanent residency to legal immigrants over their use of food stamps, Medicaid or other public benefits. Green card applicants must show they would not be burdens to the country or "public charges".
 Immigrant rights advocates deemed it a "wealth test", while health experts warned of poorer health outcomes and rising costs as low-income migrants chose between necessary services and trying to stay in the country legally.
 The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Cook County filed the lawsuit in Chicago and planned to submit arguments to the appeals court this month.
 "It is no surprise that Trump's team is attempting to remove barriers that would not allow enforcement of his unlawful public charge definition, even after the courts clapped back at him earlier this week," Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, whose office argued the case, said in a statement on Wednesday.
 "I have confidence that the law will prevail here and immigrants across America will be treated fairly as human beings while this gets sorted in the appeal process." Democrat Joe Biden has promised to end the policy if he is elected president.
 The rule has already been heavily litigated.
 In January, the US Supreme Court reversed a hold on the policy after lawsuits. However, enforcement was halted by a federal judge in New York because of the coronavirus pandemic. By September, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed that hold and the rule took effect nationwide.

 # Levine: Sacrifices 'absolutely necessary' to mitigate COVID spread in PA
 Brian Myszkowski
 Pocono Record
 Pennsylvania’s Department of Health confirmed an additional 2,795 cases of COVID-19 as of Wednesday, noting that daily increases are now the highest they have been since the start of the pandemic.
 The Nov. 4 report elevated the commonwealth’s total coronavirus count to 217,666 cases. An additional 35 deaths were also reported, bringing the statewide total to 8,890 fatalities linked to the virus.
 On Tuesday, the DOH reported Pennsylvania’s largest daily count yet with 2,875 positive cases, raising concerns among Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration, the DOH and health professionals.
 “#COVID19 case counts have reached an all-time high in Pennsylvania,” Wolf said in a Wednesday tweet. “Please protect yourself and your loved ones from this virus. The best thing we can do right now is keep our distance, wear masks in public, avoid crowds, and practice good health habits.”
 According to the DOH, 217,017 tests were performed in the Keystone State from Oct. 28 to Nov. 3, with 16,425 positive cases.
 As of 10 p.m. on Nov. 2, 49,087 test results were reported to the department, “a record high number of (polymerase chain reaction) test results” that show if an individual has an active infection.
 Positive viral antigen tests, another diagnostic test, have reached a total of 4,130 individuals who are considered probable cases, along with 646 individuals who have a positive serology test and either COVID-19 symptoms or high-risk exposure.
 On Tuesday, the Wolf administration began distribution of the fourth allotment of antigen test kits provided by the federal government to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified institutions in Elk, Lawrence, Mifflin and Philadelphia counties.
 Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine noted that the kits are “timely, quick and easy-to-use tools for communities to receive rapid COVID-19 testing.”
 “These test kits, provided by the federal government and being distributed to areas in need by the Wolf administration, will further help communities struggling with the spread of COVID-19,” Levine said. “Antigen tests look for pieces of proteins that make up the SARS-CoV-2 virus and are less sensitive than PCR tests for detecting COVID-19 infections.”
 The bulk of COVID-19 diagnoses currently encompass citizens ages 25 and older. Nearly 36% of those who have tested positive to date fall into the 25- to 49-year-old range, while 21% are ages 50 to 64, and nearly 21% are ages 65 and older.
 However, the DOH also reported that there have been “significant increases in the COVID-19 cases” among younger age ranges, especially among 19- to 24-year- olds. As of the end of October, this age bracket has increased across the state, ranging from 12% of total counts in the southwest and south-central regions to 28% of cases in the north-central region.
 On Wednesday, the DOH announced that Levine would hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss the latest news on the COVID-19 vaccine, and Pennsylvania’s plan to distribute it once it is available.
 On Wednesday, the DOH announced that Levine would hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss the latest news on the COVID-19 vaccine, and Pennsylvania’s plan to distribute it once it is available.
 DOH press secretary Maggi Mumma has said that in order to protect Pennsylvanians, everyone in the commonwealth must do their part - even if they have grown frustrated with life in the pandemic
 “We must be united by wearing a mask, washing our hands, social distancing and avoiding large gatherings, downloading the COVID Alert PA mobile app and getting a flu vaccine,” Mumma said.
 “There are currently restrictions on gatherings, limited capacities in businesses and a universal masking order. As Pennsylvanians continue to make sacrifices each day to each themselves and others safe, the department is working each day to determine what steps are necessary to best protect Pennsylvanians.”
 Wolf, Levine and the DOH have continued to adamantly promote those mitigation efforts, especially in light of the upcoming holiday season, to prevent the pandemic from further spreading out of control.
 “We are asking people to stay within their households and to contact their friends and their families in a more virtual way,” Levine said on Oct. 29. “And that’s a tremendous sacrifice that we’re asking people to make, but it is absolutely necessary at this challenging time.”

Sainsbury’s is expected to announce redundancies today, The Times reported. It will axe a number of roles at Argos, which it bought in 2016, but also cut jobs in its supermarkets on the fresh meat, fish and deli counters.
 The cuts come despite supermarkets holding up well in the pandemic. The firm declined to comment on the reports last night.
 The new lockdown, which requires all ‘non-essential’ retailers to close, removes half the available shopping hours between now and Christmas, when many firms make most of their annual profit.
 Earlier this week shops launched a last-minute push for Christmas sales with many – including John Lewis and Currys PC World – extending hours into the evening.
 Despite this long queues formed on High Streets across the country, while bookings for pubs, restaurants and hair salons also jumped. The retail sector is already lobbying hard for trading hours to be extended once shops can reopen, with the boss of Primark saying he could justify opening some stores 24 hours a day in December.
 Covid could leave up to 18,000 UK High Street shops empty as vacancies rise to the highest level since 2013, according to analysis by the Local Data Company and Springboard.
 Lloyds said it will axe 1,070 jobs and hire 340, on top of 865 cuts in September. The decision raised eyebrows as last week the firm announced profits of more than £1billion for July to September.
 The Unite union criticised the lender for punishing staff who had stood by the bank through the pandemic. National officer Rob MacGregor said: ‘Unite is calling on Lloyds Banking Group to do the right thing and put on hold its restructure plans.’

PEORIA -- Basketball is not dead yet for 2020-21 in central Illinois.
   
 Peoria Christian School and Lewistown High School both say they will begin practices as scheduled on Nov. 16 and play games when the IHSA season starts Nov. 30.
   
 They are the first two schools in the Peoria area to publicly confirm they will play basketball.
   
 Morton High School's board has indicated it wants athletes to play, and will hold an approval vote on Nov. 17. Washington High School says it will begin practices on Nov. 16 and is waiting for more guidance from the Illinois Department of Public Health and Illinois State Board of Education regarding basketball.
   
 The Catholic Diocese of Peoria notified all its high schools -- including Notre Dame High School -- that basketball would not be played in 2020-21.
   
 Peoria Public Schools is expected to make its decision at its board meeting Monday.
   
 "We are going to play hoops," Lewistown athletic director Greg Bennett said. "The question for us is, will we have anyone to play against?
   
 "We have a conference meeting (on Thursday) and we'll get a better idea then of who else is playing. We feel we can safely play, and it's something we want for the kids.
   
 "I'm sure Gov. Pritzker has a few more shoes to drop in all this, too.
   
 "Just about everyone else I talk to is waiting to see how this plays out."
   
 Said Peoria Christian athletic director Cory Hynek:
   
 "We felt the IHSA mitigations and guidelines provide a safe way to play basketball. We've had no superspreader events during our contact days. Our kids need an opportunity to play.
   
 "Our parents will make the final decision on what's best for their children. If they choose not to play, that's OK. But the kids deserve to have the chance.
   
 "We don't know yet who we are going to play against. But we feel there are going to be other schools who decide to play. I've already done four basketball schedules this year.
   
 "We want our kids to have exposure to our coaches. How do you learn to work through adversity, deal with challenges?"
   
 The IHSA, in a battle with Gov. JB Priztker -- who has declared basketball won't be permitted in the winter -- has decided to move ahead with its November season launch and left participation up to each school district.
   
 "I was happy to see the IHSA take a stand on this issue," Morton School Board president Shad Beaty said Tuesday night. "We should support the IHSA. We don't know if the governor will allow high school basketball to be played in the spring.
   
 "Our job as school board members is to do what's best for our students, and going forward with basketball is what's best for them."
   
 Washington High School, meanwhile, is moving forward with practices on Nov. 16 and waiting to see if more clarity comes from the state.
   
 "Where we stand, we are playing hoops," Washington athletic director Herb Knoblauch said. "We are starting practices on Nov. 16. But we have to follow what (IDPH and ISBE) are giving us. We've received no written guidelines from them.
   
 "We had a meeting of Mid-Illini Conference athletic directors this morning, and the consensus was we need need guidelines from IDPH and ISBE. We don't have anything we can present yet to our school boards to get approval to play. What's out there from the state is vague, and we can't make a clearcut decision.
   
 "So we're in a holding pattern."

The University of Wisconsin System will pioneer a new, federally funded testing plan by providing 250,000 COVID-19 tests at on-campus sites as early as Thursday.
 The U.S. Department of Health and Services is distributing 15 million BinaxNOW tests as “additional temporary federal support” to areas with high rates of COVID-19, according to a press release Wednesday. It is the first federal testing push using the tests, which were purchased from medical technology company Abbott and provide results within 15 minutes.
 Interim UW System President Tommy Thompson, who served as federal Health and Human Services secretary between 2001 and 2005 under President George W. Bush, called the plan a “tremendous undertaking” Wednesday. He said the tests, which will last about five weeks, will help reduce spread among on- and off-campus students, vocational school students and community members.
