William Darrah Kelley, a founder of the Republican Party and personal friend of Abraham Lincoln, visited the South in 1887 for "rest in a genial climate." As he toured North Florida, he was perplexed by the lack of apparent development, so he asked residents how they managed to survive off those fallow fields.
   
 They quipped that they got by "on sweet potatoes and consumptive Yankees." When he asked what they sold, they answered, "Our atmosphere."
   
 By selling its salubrious climate to northerners weary of winter, Florida found a way to recover from years of economic hardships caused by the Civil War. And one of the groups most eager to visit were those suffering from consumption (tuberculosis).
   
 Ironically, while visitors started coming to the state to restore their health, they often found themselves at greater risk from the deadly tropical diseases that plagued the state - malaria and the infamous Yellow Jack, the nickname for yellow fever.
   
 Although the cause of tuberculosis had been discovered in 1882, until the 1950s the most common treatment for the disease was the "rest cure." Establishments known as sanatoriums became prevalent throughout the country in an effort to cure what had grown into an 18th-century epidemic and only worsened as the nation became more industrialized.
   
 Tuberculosis was dubbed the "White Death" due to the pallor of its victims. Doctors often prescribed winter visits to sanatoriums in the sunny South to ease their patients' suffering.
   
 St. Augustine and Jacksonville were destinations of choice. Enterprising businessmen constructed health spas on the springs of the St. Johns and Suwannee rivers to entice northern travelers to stop, rest and take the waters. But in 1887 and 1888 successive yellow fever outbreaks ravaged the state, just as railroad magnate Henry Flagler was transforming the state's tourism with the opening of his Hotel Ponce de Leon in St. Augustine.
   
 Despite the fact that nearby Jacksonville was quarantined in 1888, Flagler's marketing proclaimed that St. Augustine possessed an "incomparable treasury of balmy airs, golden sunshine - and health-giving waters" with a record of "three hundred years of uninterrupted health."
   
 A glowing 1883 publication titled the "Eden of the South" proclaimed Alachua County to be a "natural sanatorium," yet Gainesville suffered a lethal outbreak of yellow fever in September 1888. Guards were posted at the county line and charged with keeping infected visitors out.
   
 Yellow fever was thought to have arrived in St. Augustine as early as 1649, and the town suffered outbreaks throughout its history. In the 1800s, the disease was fought with familiar methods such as quarantines and bizarre efforts such as igniting enormous fires and a barrage of cannon salvos to purify the "miasmic" air. Treatments, also odd by today's standards, included mustard footbaths, doses of calomel and castor oil, and enemas "if necessary," according to the Florida Times Union newspaper.
   
 Tampa mayor and former Confederate Army surgeon John P. Wall correctly surmised that mosquitoes spread the yellow fever virus, and he took means to improve sanitation and control mosquitoes in Tampa. Outbreaks diminished after the turn of the century.
   
 The state would again be ravaged by disease in 1918 with the arrival of the Spanish flu, a global pandemic that took thousands of lives in Florida and resulted in 675,000 deaths nationwide. Historian Gary Mormino noted that at one point one-third of the students at the University of Florida were ill.
   
 Methods to combat the outbreak varied; both Ocala and Lakeland closed schools, and Pensacola banned public gatherings. The Ocala Evening Star published directions for making gauze masks for use while caring for influenza patients, but on the same page, the paper advertised Jacksonville's Windsor Hotel, a favorite of northern tourists.
   
 But the deaths brought by Spanish flu and yellow fever combined are modest compared with the damage wrought by the introduction of diseases by Europeans that wiped out whole societies of indigenous people in less than two centuries. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived on Florida's shores in 1513, they brought with them deadly germs that led to smallpox, measles and flu outbreaks among native populations.
   
 Since the Civil War, Florida's promoters worked hard to create the notion that the "Land of Flowers" was a paradise of healthy beaches, restorative forests and recuperative springs - despite outbreaks of tropical diseases. Our state's economy was built on visitors seeking escape. It will be interesting to see how our economy fares against this latest viral villain.

COLUMBUS -- The Ohio High School Athletic Association has suspended all winter sports tournaments, effectively immediately, in response to the COVID-19 virus emergency.  
 Executive Director Jerry Snodgrass made the announcement around 12:40 p.m. Thursday at St. John Arena, shortly before the start of West Branch's Division II state semifinal girls basketball game against Dayton Carroll.  
 "This is undoubtedly one of the toughest days in my career," Snodgrass said.  
 The remainder of the girls state tournament, the boys regional tournaments and the state ice hockey and wrestling tournaments have been postponed indefinitely. The decision was made, Snodgrass said, literally moments before "because of what's transpiring across the nation.  
 "We say they are postponed indefinitely and I don't want to say 'canceled,' but it's on the table," said Snodgrass.  
 Snodgrass noted the increasingly fast developing scenarios around the country. Since Wednesday night, the NBA, Major League Soccer and Major League Baseball suspended operations. Several college conference basketball tournaments, including the Big Ten, were canceled.  
 "The spread of this [virus] has increased dramatically in large gatherings," said Snodgrass. "Just in wrestling alone, we are talking about 630 participants.  
 Snodgrass said he is especially emotional for the young athletes who won't be able to finish their season, but "their health, and the health of their families are the greater concern."  
 At St. John Arena, both West Branch and Dayton Carroll players were on the floor for warmups when Snodgrass emerged from a room and gathered both teams' coaches and a few OHSAA staff. They met for just a few minutes behind closed doors then the players walked off the floor to their respective locker rooms.  
 "There is more value in these tournaments than wins and losses," said Snodgrass. "I know how much they have invested in this. That's part … of why it's so emotional for me. We [the OHSAA] live this through the kids that play.  
 "But there is a greater, national concern here."

During the summer of 2004, 15-year-old Brett Jones was living with his grandparents in Lee County, Mississippi. One afternoon Jones got into an argument with his grandfather and stabbed him to death.
   
 Jones had claimed he acted in self-defense. Prosecutors argued that Jones was an angry young man who killed his 67-year-old grandfather by deliberately stabbing him eight times, hiding his body and fleeing.
   
 Jones was tried and convicted of first-degree murder. The court sentenced Jones to a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole -- the only sentence available at the time.
   
 Less than three months before the verdict in Jones' case, the United States Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for juveniles. In Roper v. Simmons, the high court ruled that a national consensus had established the nation's evolving standards of decency against executing juveniles.
   
 The Supreme Court's ruling permitted Jones to narrowly escape execution. That is not the only time a Supreme Court ruling would indirectly help Jones. Now his case is scheduled for review by the Supreme Court.
   
 The journey that Jones has taken through the criminal justice system exemplifies the high court's evolution as it relates to the punishment of juveniles.
   
 In 2010, in a case out of Florida, 17-year-old Terrence Graham was convicted of a home invasion and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A year earlier, he was convicted of burglary and attempted armed robbery.
   
 In Graham v. Florida, the Supreme Court ruled that a juvenile can only be sentenced to life without parole if he is convicted of murder. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, "The concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment." As a result of abolishing the most serious punishment -- death -- for juveniles, the penultimate punishment -- life without parole -- must now be reserved for murder.
   
 Two years later, the high court further restricted punishment for juveniles, ruling in Miller v. Alabama that mandatory life in prison for juveniles was unconstitutional. At the time, there were about 2,500 inmates serving life sentences for murders committed as juveniles.
   
 However, the court did not determine if the Miller decision was retroactive until 2016. Once the court ruled that all inmates sentenced to mandatory life in prison prior to Miller were entitled to be resentenced, Jones' case came back to a Mississippi court for review.
   
 The Mississippi Supreme Court vacated the sentence and remanded the case to the circuit court for resentencing. The circuit court conducted a hearing and found that Jones was not entitled to parole eligibility under Miller.
   
 Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Jones' appeal. The issue raised by Jones is whether a court resentencing a juvenile lifer must determine, and make a finding, that an inmate is not amenable to rehabilitation and is incorrigible. The sentencing court in Jones's case did neither.
   
 One insight into what the Supreme Court may be thinking is to look at the oral argument last fall in the case of Lee Boyd Malvo, the juvenile D.C. Beltway Sniper, whose case became moot after Virginia enacted a new law that made juveniles, who were sentenced to life in prison, eligible for parole after they had served 26 years.
   
 According to the New York Times, several justices during the Malvo argument indicated that consideration of incorrigibility was important. Left-leaning Justice Elena Kagan said the court's prior retroactivity decision could be boiled down to two words: "Youth matters."
   
 Conservative Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said the Court's prior rulings required judges to distinguish between "someone who's merely immature as opposed to incorrigible."
   
 Will the Supreme Court come to the aid of Brett Jones yet again? Only time will tell, a decision is not anticipated for another year.

Technical chart claims that BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (BKCC) would settle between $2.98/share to $3.26/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $2.57 mark, then the market for BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $2.44 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.82. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Within a month of China’s reporting, the outbreak had managed to spread to more than 100 countries and infect at least 174,000 people. For me, a turning point was the cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan in February. By the end of a distressing public health experiment, in which Japanese officials forced passengers to stay on board to minimize spread on the mainland, more than 700 people were infected and eight had died. If we didn’t already know it, this showed just how effective the virus was at spreading fast and killing some.

Speaking of anxiety, I've been relatively anxiety-free since I got out on my own in my early 20s. All through my childhood I had terrible anxiety, which manifested in an unhappy digestive system. Always had a stomach ache, trouble controlling my bowels. Upset. I was always upset. I understood why totally, my parents created a very tense atmosphere, and after many years of therapy and self-examination I understood why they were so tense. But a few years after I established myself outside their house the digestive problems magically went away. They're back. Started just after watching Trump's Oval Office speech last Wednesday. I was already hunkered down. I understood what was coming. What was clear from his speech that he didn't. He was still throwing out racist bullshit. From the fucking Oval Office. After that, I realized fully how fucked we are. There have been moments of relaxation. But they're few and far between now. #
