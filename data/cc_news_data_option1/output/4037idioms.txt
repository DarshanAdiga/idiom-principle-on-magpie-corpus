Will losing Lucas Torreira be a positive or a negative?
 And so we bid goodbye to our little man in midfield, Lucas Torreira, who inevitably was going to leave anyway given that he had dropped down the pecking order at the club, falling behind Ceballos and the rejuvenated Elneny, and given that we were in the hunt for, and then finally got, another midfielder, it was clear to see that his time at the club was up.
 It is sad that he has left, only because he had the potential to be a great player at the club, maybe lack of playing time and injuries played a part in us not being able to see his full potential, but on his day we cant deny that he didn’t do well because there were times that he was flawless and showed us why we got him in the first place.
 I do believe that La Liga would be a better fit for Torreira though, and given that he plied most of his trade in Italy and given that Spain and Italy are quite similar in terms of conditions and demands, it may be why he was unable to cope with the weather and the demands in the Premier League, which is why he failed to really make a statement.
 Although he has gone on loan, there is an option for Atletico to buy him come the end of the season, an option which I am sure they will take up, given that we have now added Thomas Partey to our ranks it is clear there won’t really be any room for Torreira if he returns.
 I wish him the best of luck in his journey at Atletico Madrid and I hope he manages to find the talent and the strength to go back to being the player that first made Arsenal turn and buy him.
 Gooners how do you feel about Torreira leaving us?

It took a pair of ill-timed cancelations for the matchup to materialize, but Pillow Academy’s football team will face off Friday night against a public school for the first time in the program’s 52 years on the gridiron.


  Pillow reached out to nearby J.Z. George -— the only public school in Leflore or Carroll County playing football this fall — after both teams lost their scheduled opponents due to COVID-19. The rest was history.


  “I talked to Coach (Rusty) Smith and we’re just really, really glad it all worked out,” Pillow coach Tripp McCarty said. “We didn’t want to have an off week, they didn’t want to have one, we’re right down the road. Both teams are going to get the chance to play a football game, which is good especially this year with all the craziness going on.”


  With the Mustangs’ homecoming game threatened by both COVID-19 and the incoming Hurricane Delta, it’s clear the Mustangs are just happy to hold their festivities under the lights — no matter rain or shine, public school or private.


  “I’m really happy to just have another week of football,” defensive end Britt Reichle said. “You never know if a game’s going to be canceled and when.”


  McCarty is keeping an eye on the weather, but he doesn’t seem too worried about how the elements might affect his run-heavy offense.


  “It’s just football, man,” McCarty said. “It’s an outside sport that can be played in the mud. We can do it. We have washing machines.”


  Whatever the conditions might be at Bill Davis Field, best believe McCarty has experienced worse.


  “I remember one down in Oak Forest years ago that our managers couldn’t keep their shoes on,” McCarty recalled. “The mud was higher than their ankles, and they were running out of their shoes and picking them up on the way back. That was a good one.”


  For the first time since Week 1, Pillow should be at full strength on Friday. Key contributors Frazier Rose, Britt Reichle and Christian Belk have each been out one game this season along with McCarty, who returns to the sidelines after missing last week’s 42-7 loss to Starkville Academy.


  “It’ll be nice to get the whole gang back together,” McCarty said. “Hopefully we got a lot more football left in us.”


  The Mustangs will need all hands on deck to reestablish the same running game that fueled their early four-game winning streak. During that stretch, they averaged an impressive 6 yards per carry while surpassing 300 yards rushing three times. Since then, Pillow has averaged 4 yards per tote over its last two games — not bad, but not enough for an offense that averages less than 40 yards per game through the air.


  There have been flashes of passing potential, including last week’s 62-yard toss from junior quarterback Nelson Hodges to senior wideout Matthew Jefcoat. But unfortunately for the Mustangs, they added a pair of interceptions for the second game in a row.


  Senior signal caller Christian Belk will look to build on a strong outing last week, when he rushed for 114 yards on 13 carries against Starkville.


  The potentially inclement weather and homecoming celebration might overshadow the historical significance of Friday night’s matchup.


  Pillow Academy was among dozens of Mississippi private schools that were founded in resistance to court-ordered desegregation in the 1960s and 1970s. Pillow has since integrated, however, with a non-discriminatory policy since at least 1989 and black students for at least a decade. The Mustangs have played public schools in other sports such as baseball and basketball, but never football — until now.


  “It might become this area’s rivalry, who knows,” Reichle said.

LAWRENCE -- Les Miles gave two prognoses Wednesday for injured Kansas football quarterback Jalon Daniels.
   
 The first, a look into the more immediate future for the freshman, wasn't encouraging.
   
 "We expect that it might take him a bit to get back," Miles said during his weekly radio program.
   
 But Miles went on, insistent on also offering a sunnier long-term evaluation of Daniels.
   
 "We enjoy him. He's going to be a future for us," Miles continued. "He's a guy that can throw the football, a guy that can run the football. So we know what we've got there and we can't wait to get him back."
   
 Quarterback play has arguably been the biggest ailment for the winless Jayhawks.
   
 Daniels, junior Miles Kendrick and senior Thomas MacVittie have all shared snaps at the position, and the results haven't been pretty -- out of 74 qualifying programs, KU (0-3, 0-2 Big 12) ranks 66th in passing offense (146.7 yards per game), 70th in passing yards per attempt (4.8) and dead last in passing yards per completion (8.15).
   
 KU's offense ranks 67th in yards per game (296) and 70th in points per game (14.7).
   
 And the Jayhawks are still on the hunt for a full-time quarterback.
   
 "We're going to compete," Miles said. "We're going to turn and find a guy and we're going to walk him on the field and he's going to compete for us."
   
 Daniels doesn't appear to be an option for that role, at least for the time being.
   
 The 6-foot, 200-pound former three-star recruit suffered an apparent foot injury in the first half of last Saturday's 47-7 defeat to then-No. 17 Oklahoma State and didn't return -- Daniels was spotted on the sideline in a walking boot late in the contest. After starting and playing the entirety of the Jayhawks' 47-14 defeat at Baylor, Daniels struggled to find traction against the Cowboys, finishing 3-for-5 passing for 2 yards.
   
 The KU offense went three-and-out on its first three possessions and punted on its fourth, Daniels' final appearance.
   
 Despite the apparent long-term nature of his injury, Daniels will "absolutely" return this season, said Miles, who added the freshman is "a special player" and an individual whose return will "escalate" the competition in the quarterback room.
   
 Kendrick, who traded possessions with MacVittie in Game 1 until the latter suffered a shoulder injury, couldn't get the KU offense going against OSU, finishing 11-for-19 passing for 90 yards and an interception. Kendrick and Daniels were sacked four times by the Cowboys and oversaw a Jayhawk offense that went 1-for-14 on third downs.
   
 "Everybody has to look within ourselves individually, see what we need to do," Kendrick said Saturday. "Every day we need to work on individually getting better each and every day, coming together as an offense, finding our identity -- what do we do well and what are we going to take advantage of week to week -- and keep moving forward."
   
 MacVittie was 5-for-9 passing for 20 yards with a hard-luck interception in his team's 38-23 defeat to Coastal Carolina on Sept. 12, also rushing six times for 37 yards. Miles estimated last Saturday that MacVittie is about "a week away" from returning.
   
 "(MacVittie) wants to be back in. He's pushing the envelope. He's healing. It's a shoulder," Miles said Wednesday. "But he's a special young guy. He sees his future, wants to compete, has a nick but he's going to take care of it. I'm for him."
   
 Miles has expressed optimism that MacVittie could be available for the team's next game, an 11 a.m. Oct. 17 matchup at West Virginia, but if he isn't, look for an extended run for Kendrick -- and perhaps a look at a newcomer to the picture.
   
 "(Junior) Miles Fallin had a really wonderful practice," Miles said. "I mean he's 6-(foot)-5 and ready, very bright and capable."
   
 Kendrick, who acknowledged that he "needs to be better," said it's no secret what Miles and offensive coordinator Brent Dearmon are seeking in their quest for a long-term answer at the sport's most important position.
   
 "Leadership, execution, toughness, playmaking ability -- just all the qualities that you look for in a quarterback," Kendrick responded. "I feel like that's what they're looking for, and whoever brings it to the table is going to be the guy that gets the majority of the reps moving forward."

The Coronavirus seems to have been good for one man’s career, Ronald McDonald.
   
 The mascot of fast food chain McDonald’s has a renewed sense of purpose – to serve as a symbol of the importance of masks and social distancing.
   
 Old Ronald began to seem outdated, even in India, where the company started operations only in the late 1990s. Typically, he would be seated on a bench outside the restaurant – his body language being of a man who did not have much to do and had become a sideshow in his own house.
   
 The heady days when everyone, including Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan, took a picture with him seemed to have dwindled.
   
 Ronald suffered a further setback in 2016. Gun-carrying people in clown costumes were spotted in certain parts of the US. McDonald’s was forced to shelve Ronald for a while.
   
 At that time, McDonald's spokesman Terri Hickey said, "McDonald's and franchisees in the local markets are mindful of the current climate around clown sightings in communities and as such are being thoughtful in respect to Ronald McDonald's participation in community events for the time being,"
   
 So, on October 6, when McDonald’s India announced that it will open its restaurants in Maharashtra, MoneyControl made an inquiry about the future of Ronald. The company’s response suggested that rumours of his full retirement have been exaggerated.
   
 Sharing an announcement it had made in June, McDonald’s India said Ronald will be used as a medium to communicate the importance of masks and social distancing.
   
 “McDonald statues will now be seen sporting masks across all outlets to encourage more and more people to adopt safe practices to prevent the spread of the pandemic,” the statement said.
   
 It then quoted Arvind RP, Director – Marketing and Communications, McDonald’s India (West and South). “Ronald is an icon that people and especially children love,” said Arvind.
   
 “We hope that Ronald wearing a mask will make a strong statement and encourage more and more people to follow these very important safety measures.”
 Elvis may have left the building, but Ronald McDonald has not.

MARSHFIELD - The 2019 Marshfield High girls soccer team made a decent run to get into the postseason, only to be ousted after a tight competitive, game, 2-0 by Bishop Feehan. The Rams' disappointment at that loss was assuaged a bit when the Shamrocks (23-0-1) went on to win the Division 1 state championship.


  But there won't be much chance of building off the pride of a close battle with the state champs, because the bulk of that 2019 team's core graduated. How much soccer talent that 2019 class contained might be seen by noting that players from that group now play for the University of Rhode Island, University of Massachusetts, Bryant University, and Salve Regina.


  It's not like the cupboard is bare but the 2020 Rams will have a few veterans, and many more players either joining varsity for the first time, or seeing their first substantial minutes at the top level. Coach Dominic Centorino welcomed a stunning 71 candidates to the opening of practice this fall, so the varsity, JVs and freshman teams will all be fully stocked. And the Patriot League 'bubble' schedule is a bit unusual, in a good way for a young team, as five of the Rams' first six games are at home. They started the season Friday with a 6-0 loss to Hingham.


  "We lost a really strong senior core to graduation," said Centorino. "I would say at least three of them were just stellar athletes, the kind that are very hard to replace. This year's team is going to have to have a whole new identity of its own. We have some carryover, in returning players, but the new rules and everything make it all initially a bit overwhelming. I think our starting later this year has all the girls itching to get out there and play soccer, but it also leaves us a little behind on team bonding. Ultimately this season will be about the girls having fun, and bonding with their teammates, and we're just hoping to emphasize that, while playing good, competitive soccer."


  Marshfield has a couple of veteran captains in seniors Sam McGregor and Julie Alcaro, and the latter has a real desire to get back into action. Alcaro tore up her knee and missed all of her junior season.


  "They are a good pair of players to build around, and they are helping the other girls learn what it takes," said Centorino. "We kept as many players as we could this fall, so we have 29 players on our varsity team, and it is very senior-heavy, with 15 seniors. So I think that class will play a big role here, and Sam and Julie are excellent leaders."


  A couple of other veterans will play major roles for the new-look Rams, in juniors Riley Drosopoulos, a defender, and Bridgette Barrowman, an offensive- minded midfielder.


  "Riley is an outstanding back and we're lucky to have her," said Centorino, "while Bridgette is a junior who's basically been a starter since her freshman year. Those are two really important cogs for us."


  Marshfield High's reboot had to begin in net, where the 2019 team had standout netminder Kate McNeill.


  "We'll have senior Stella Scholfield and sophomore Sydney Sheehan playing goalkeeper for us," said Centorino. "They have both looked good so far. We also have a freshman goalie playing on the JVs - it's always good to have a couple goalies in the system, and after graduating Kate we had to replenish that position."


  Some other key performers come from all the classes.


  "We're looking for a big season from senior Laney Zaslaw, who scored a hat trick against Cohasset last year," noted Centorino. "And Laney has her kid sister, sophomore Sammy Zaslaw, a midfielder also on the team. We have two sets of sisters, with Sam McGregor's sophomore sister Maddie, a defender and midfielder, joining us, so that's always a good thing."


  "Mya D'Antonio is another young player with lots of potential, a sophomore forward who came up as a freshman last year," said Centorino. "And then we have junior Nadia Kiziuk, a very skilled midfielder. Sydney McCabe is another fine midfielder player, a junior, as is forward Sara Weijkus, and they've done well."


  "A couple of seniors we're looking to are forward Celine LeDoux and midfielder Gwyn O'Sullivan, and they are certainly in the mix too," said Centorino.


  When you get to the more specific roles, it isn't quite as clear who might emerge as the Rams scoring threats.


  "Last year we shared the wealth, and no one person scored a lot of goals," said Centorino. "I suspect it may be that way again. We have a lot of forwards this year, and we'll try and rotate them all in. One thing that helps there is the quarters format, instead of just playing halves like we did before. Four periods will help break it up and help us manage everyone's minutes better."


  The new pandemic MIAA rules changes are also likely to boost offense. There are no throw-ins but rather kick-ins, no heading the ball, no slide tackles, and minimal shoulder to shoulder contact allowed. Most observers would suggest it will make playing defense even more difficult.


  "We are expecting there will be penalties and a lot of indirect kicks for contact fouls," said Centorino. "And with teams unable to form defensive walls, those set plays become even more important. I think we are expecting a big season from Julie Alcaro, who has been itching to play for over a year, and did a lot of work to recover from her knee injury. We also expect to get some scoring from Bridgette Barrowman out of the midfield, as well as Laney Zaslaw, and Syndey McCabe."


  The Rams have studied the new rules and played two pre-season scrimmages, with referees to help them adjust.


  "Initially we all had some officials do a Zoom meeting to explain the new rules, and how they would be interpreted," Centorino explained. "My first impression was that this could be a high-scoring season for everyone, and from what we've seen it will be, but not absurdly so. I also believe the boys game is much more physical and faster than our game, so it may not be as big an adjustment for us. The silver lining, for us coaches, is that the key to playing with this new rulebook is stressing possession. We have to be more deliberate and patient with how we progress the ball down the field. And those direct free kicks with no wall will be big plays."


  "Our defenders have had two scrimmages with game officials to help us adjust," Centorino added. "The officials we had took the time to explain the calls they made, and those scrimmages - against Pembroke and Silver Lake - really helped us. If you kick the ball in the air, for example, it's a re- start. We have to play within the confines of the new rules, and find a way to be successful. But none of us wants a whistle every two minutes, or to ruin the flow of the game. We are hoping for consistency in enforcing the rules, and we know the officials' job is hard. But the main goal, is for everyone involved to have some fun playing soccer, and hopefully developing their skills, while enjoying all the social and emotional benefits of being part of a team"


  After the Rams' opening game, the state lifted restrictions on crowd sizes, so they anticipate being able to have up to 250 fans for each remaining home game. All the players and coaches were anxious to get going, and they have had to basically shrug off any misgivings about getting a late start and a compressed season. But once again, Marshfield becoming a full-fledged member of the Patriot League this fall has eased the way, and provided a competitive 11-game season.


  "There was a time we didn't know if this season would happen," Centorino admitted. "Finally they gave us a date and a structure, and we got to work. We do miss having more pre-season time, but we have 11 girls who play year-round, which helps. Every other team is in the same boat as far as limited practice, and I think we miss the opportunity for team bonding most of all. I have to give Bill Battis, our athletic director, a lot of thanks for all he's done, because he's been awesome, and brings so much credibility to our program. Our tryouts went well, the team looks good so far, and everyone is in agreement - it's great to be back."

Village Centre Cinemas at Lewiston is determined to stay open despite the one-two punches of a pandemic that has throttled Hollywood’s ability to crank out new movie releases and the immediate closure of 663 theaters owned by Cineworld that owns Regal Cinemas in the U.S. and Britain.


  “Our current plan in Lewiston, we are attempting to stay open and our plan is to operate on weekends,” said Michelle Dougherty, retail manager for Village Centre Cinemas in Lewiston, Moscow, Pullman and Spokane.


  The Village Centre Cinemas aren’t owned by Cineworld/Regal or any other national chain but are an independent theater company, Dougherty said.


  All local theaters were closed immediately following the spring shutdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Idaho businesses were able to reopen in mid-June. Washington’s movie theaters remain closed for the time being.


  In June, Lewiston’s theater picked up immediately and Dougherty said an attempt was made to reopen the Eastside Marketplace cinema in Moscow three weeks ago.


  “We had two really great weekends, then it really died down,” in Moscow, she said, resulting in a second closure.


  “We’re really being proactive (because of the rising coronavirus cases on the Palouse) and that was in part,” the reason for closing down the Moscow theater again.


  “We don’t want any of our staff getting sick and we’re very grateful that we have not had any,” she added.


  Chris Wagner, who owns the Blue Fox Theatre and Sunset Auto-Vue drive-in at Grangeville and the Rex Theater in Orofino, said he’s planning to close down temporarily until Hollywood begins making more films available.


  The Blue Fox will close today, Wagner said. The Rex has already been closed and the Sunset Auto-Vue is expected to keep running for another two to three weeks before shuttering until next spring.


  “There’s no product,” Wagner said of the availability of movies. Even classic movies, which some theaters have used to fill in the gap, have not proven successful draws for movie patrons.


  “Everybody’s got that stuff on Netflix,” Wagner said.


  Even though there were a couple of new movie releases this summer, including the highly touted “Tenet,” which ran for several weeks at the Blue Fox, Wagner said they were not that successful at drawing in customers.


  “So people are willing to come back to the theater, but I don’t want to be open,” as long as the pickings are so slim, he said. He hopes to be able to reopen by the first of November, but that’s still to be seen.


  “I’m trying to stay as positive as I can,” Wagner said.


  Cineworld’s closures earlier this week meant 40,000 workers in the U.S. and 5,000 in Britain lost their jobs.


  Dougherty said even though her cinemas have been struggling, there have been no layoffs. There have been a few workers, however, who quit because they weren’t able to work enough hours.


  She said the Village Centre Cinemas also have been hurt by the dearth of current movies, but, on the flip side, independently produced films that otherwise would not have been shown because of contracts with the major suppliers have remained popular with audiences. And there have been a few current movies — some of which are showing this weekend — that promise to be crowd-pleasers.


  “The big release, which is still tentative, is ‘Wonder Woman,’ which was originally scheduled for August then pushed to October and now it’s Christmas Day, Dec. 25,” Dougherty said.


  That all depends, however, on whether theaters in New York City can open for the premiere.


  As far as the Pullman cinema, Dougherty said it is hoped to be able to reopen by Oct. 16, and possibly the Moscow venue as well, although the situation remains on a week-to-week basis.


  Dougherty said at the Lewiston theater, “we highly recommend masks but we do not require them.”


  All staff members wear masks and gloves that are routinely changed out, and the cinemas are regularly sanitized between showings.


  “We really say the safest place to be is in the movie theater,” Dougherty said. “We have really strong safety guidelines and sanitizing guidelines. It’s pretty remarkable what we have.”


  She added that even though patrons are mixed on wearing masks in the theater, “one thing I’ve noticed is, we haven’t seen any people disrespecting (others) for wearing or not wearing masks. We’ve had a couple of patrons that questioned (the mask policy) but our job is to help provide an amazing short getaway for people and our staff as well.”

Deven Farthing made his first trip from Atlanta to Lake Havasu City to watch his father Dustin compete in the IJSBA World Finals before his first birthday and has been back nearly every year since. On Wednesday, roughly 16 years since that first visit, he managed to join his father in earning the title of World Champion.
 “It just feels good to win a world championship this young and this early,” Farthing said after taking first place in the Amateur Runabout 1100 Limited. “I’ve put a lot of work into this and it’s nice just knowing that it paid off.”
 Dustin Farthing said he has won about 25 to 28 world and national championships in his 28-year career as a pro Jet Ski rider, and he has a chance to add to that total when the professionals hit the lake this weekend. Dustin had the chance to watch his son Deven win a world championship on Wednesday, and Deven will duke it out with his younger brother Talen (14) in a another race today.
 Deven Farthing said coming to Havasu every year for the World Finals is what got him interested in racing Jet Skis in the first place. He said he started riding about eight years ago, and has been racing competitively for the last six years. His brother Talen was a little slower to take up the family pastime.
 “They bet me to ride the first time and when I rode I really liked it,” Talen Farthing said. “So I just started racing.”
 “For 13 years he never wanted to ride,” Dustin Farthing added. “He was into basketball, soccer and other sports. I finally talked him into riding this last year and he has gotten into it more.”
 Dustin said it is “awesome” that his sons have embraced the sport that he loves, and watching them race lights the same competitive fire in him as one of his own races.
 “It doesn’t matter what they do, I like to win,” Farthing said. “When you are competitive it is just what you do. They enjoy it and (Talen) is starting to get more competitive and they are starting to talk smack between the two of them.”
 Troy Snyder said he has lost track of how many World Championships he has won in Havasu and also noted that he has won several national championships and the Kings Cup. This year he is unable to compete due to a broken leg, but he still felt the same nerves when his son Tory hit the water to compete in the Amateur Runabout Unlimited race Wednesday.
 “Gosh, it makes me nervous,” Snyder said. “Sometimes I get teared up in the eyes even when he does good. I watch him turn my boat and I see my number on it – it is gratifying to see him do so well. It is making me not want to do it myself anymore. I want to make sure he has good equipment and stand behind him and watch him win.”
 Tory Snyder said he picked Jet Ski racing over football last year as a junior in high school and has started focusing on racing for the last year and a half. In 2019 he managed to win a national championship, but ended up taking fourth place at the World Finals in Havasu.
 “I was kind of discouraged that I didn’t get the win, but it was my first time,” Tory said. “I had to learn and I had to feel it out. It is a lot different here – the air is different, the water can be different, so there are a lot of different variables that come into this particular race.”
 Although Tory is still chasing his first World Championship, he said having a World Champion father has definitely been a big help.
 “I remember coming here when I was young and doing homework because I was missing so much school coming here for two weeks at a time so we could test and make sure the skis were all okay,” Tory Snyder said. “So I got to see what he does to prepare. Preparation is probably one of the biggest things to racing, so seeing the way he works and how he works out at home really showed me how to win.”
 Deven and Talen Farthing said their father, Dustin, has played a similarly large role in their racing careers. Dustin Farthing said the biggest advantage he is able to provide his sons is experience.
 “You see a lot of fathers go coach their kids in basketball, but very few of them are Michael Jordan or LeBron James who can teach someone to do something like that,” Dustin said. “I can go ride something, I know what it is supposed to do, and I’ve done it before. So I can give them advice and give them an idea of what it should be feeling like.”
 “He can tell when it is riding good and when it is not, because we don’t have the experience that he has,” Deven added. “He is kind of like a coach.”
 Back in Havasu
 Although the IJSBA World Finals are back this year, the pandemic has certainly taken its toll on the scope of the event with fewer riders and some of the annual events and festivities cancelled.
 “This year is toned down compared to the last 28 years I have been coming here, but I think it was important for them to have it even if it’s limited capacity,” Dustin Farthing said. “When you skip a year people will start doing other things and you are going to lose some of the excitement of it.”
 Troy and Tory Snyder said they are happy to be here to support the town, and to keep this history of the World Finals alive.
 “A lot of championships have been won right here on this island by guys from Kuwait, to the U.S., to Japan and all over,” Troy Snyder said. “It’s a historic thing, and we didn’t want to see the event be crushed over covid. That is why we are here and we appreciate the city and Crazy Horse Campground allowing us to be here. We are very blessed that we are able to still come.”

"Our research overall indicates that the potential for regeneration is there in mammals, including humans, but some evolutionary pressure has turned it off," explained Blackshaw.
 The team suspects the loss of this ability may be linked to a trade-off between regenerating central nervous system cells and parasite resistance. Glia help restrict the spread of infections, and if they're turned into neuron-producing cells, they can't do this.
 A previous study has shown that signals which cause inflammation to ward off infections also stop glia cells from changing into neuron producers, supporting this idea.
 "We know that certain viruses, bacteria, and even parasites can infect the brain. It could be disastrous if infected brain cells were allowed to grow and spread the infection through the nervous system," says Blackshaw.
 Of course, we're still a very long way off from growing a replacement retina in actual people. The team cautions that this is a highly complicated system with many independent mechanisms involved that need to be further explored. But understanding these pathways may one day allow scientists to help us better repair damaged sight.

Editor: I am responding to the letter from Joe Thomas on Thursday, Oct. 3. Mr. Thomas, you lost all credibility when you chose to repeat the Democrat lie that there was or has ever been any collusion with Russians by our President. It was clear all along that it was a false story paid for and pushed by Hillary Clinton and the rest of the Dems/mainstream media.
 Now we are finally seeing proof that HRC not only paid for the fake info, but that she did so to distract from her illegal use of her private server. It is sad, Mr. Thomas, that you continue to cling to your Russian collusion hoax.
 Neither President Trump nor the Republican Party are creating a Constitutional crisis. However, the Democrat Party is trying to do just that. They are actively suing States all over our Country demanding mass mailing of ballots to every single name on registration rolls, ballot harvesting, outlawing Voter I.D. and removing safeguards on mail-in ballots. Sadly, they are being successful when they get liberal judges more than willing to make law from the bench.
 All of these steps, Mr. Thomas, are designed by the Democrat Party to disrupt our elections and cause a Constitutional crisis.
 I am a Christian and Constitutional Conservative. I love God and bow to Him only...not to any idol. I love my Country and respect our great President. His list of accomplishments for the people of this country is lengthy...so much so that I would go well beyond the 300 word maximum, if I began listing them. Other than selling our Country out to the Chinese and enriching himself and his family by selling his influence to China, Ukraine and who knows who else, what has Joe Biden done in 47 years? No, Mr. Thomas, we are not sheep. We are Patriots, who do not want to see our Constitutional Republic destroyed.

For the longest time the transition program for the military was centered on just getting them jobs. It really ignored the vast majority of veterans who were thinking of utilizing their GI Bill benefits. So providing more guidance and knowledge on how to make that transition is crucial: When you need to apply. What kind of credentials schools are looking for. How to package yourself as an applicant. Just a little bit of investment there, in the long run, will save taxpayer money.

JACKSON — I have written something like 1,600 columns, but I have yet to write about horses.


  This is somewhat surprising, since I have probably spent more time in a saddle than 99% of Americans.


  My grandfather, who started my family in the publishing business, borrowed money for a press and fathered two children just a year before the Great Depression hit. For 15 years he struggled weekly to pay his bills. He swore he would never borrow a dollar again.


  This was unfortunate for my father. Fresh out of Ole Miss, where he was editor of the Mississippian and elected to the Hall of Fame, my father wanted to expand the company. But his father refused to borrow.


  As a result, we missed out on one of the greatest investment opportunities in history. My father decided to leave Mississippi and be a big city editor. He ended up an editor of the Houston Chronicle, which at the time had the largest circulation in the South. And that is how I spent my childhood in the saddle of a horse.


  Once in Texas, my father got bit by the horse bug bad. Every weekend, our family was going to a horse show. My sister became one of the best teenage western riders in the state. You couldn’t fit all the trophies in her room. She barrel raced in the Astrodome.


  Every year in March, my parents would take us out of school for a week, and we would trail ride 20 or 30 miles a day culminating in the huge downtown Houston livestock parade.


  You should have seen the battle royales between my father and school administrators who refused to allow excused absences for my sister and me. For a week, we got zeroes and had to simply work that much harder at our schoolwork the rest of the year.


  The trail rides were something. About 200 horses. We would camp at night in VFW campgrounds and have big barbecues and dances every night. That’s where I got up enough courage to ask the first girl to dance. I could do a mean two- step by age 12.


  Summer camp was horse camp. We rode from sun up to sun down in the Texas hill country near Wimberly. I could ride bareback as naturally as walk down the street.


  My father founded a local stable a mile from our neighborhood. I spent countless hours scooping up horse manure and building stalls. We boarded 30 or so horses and even had endless neighborhood horse shows.


  If my father hitched up the trailer and headed to a horse auction, you could be sure he was going to come back with the horse trailer full. It was his only weakness. He would then find a buyer in our neighborhood and sign them up to board at our stable.


  He bought me a horse named Bullet, half Quarter Horse, half Thoroughbred. Bullet was trained as a polo pony, and he was high strung as hell.


  I’ve been kicked in the head, bitten in the neck, bucked off, broken ribs. It’s a miracle I survived. And I’m allergic to grass pollen, which a horse’s coat is full of.


  Apparently, my father never noticed my severe allergic reaction around horses, or my many injuries, or my indentured servitude as a horse manure shoveller. I never thought to object. It’s what our family did, so I just went along for the ride. What I really loved was motorcycles. And my father. He was simply an amazing man. You couldn’t help but follow wherever he led.


  I grew up and moved away. My father died. And at age 62, one day I realized I hadn’t ridden a horse in 40 years.


  That was about the time Doug Garland was standing near the entrance to Saltine’s while Bob Crisler, my son John and I were slurping down oysters.


  I remembered Doug from one afternoon at the veranda of River Hills, when he told me this amazing story about being injured while riding a runaway mule. As Doug would later advise me, “You can intimidate a horse, but a mule insists on seeing your resume.”


  Doug joined us at Saltine’s. I told him about my riding past and my bucket list. Next thing I know, I’m at his ranch a few miles east of Crystal Springs.


  Doug had a couple of mules and a horse already saddled and ready to go when Ginny and I arrived. Ginny hadn’t ridden since childhood, but her mule was old, wise and docile. It was fun to watch the interaction.


  Doug was on a young headstrong mule, and it wasn’t going well. I had a pretty Palomino horse named Haley. I could instantly get a sense of her obedience level, and she could instantly sense my riding experience. She was a piece of cake compared to Bullet. I went galloping off, much to Doug’s alarm. The riding came back to me instantly, like riding a bicycle.


  After a while, we hitched up a one-horse buggy. Immediately the horse got startled and ran into a fence and got stuck. Doug was apologizing, but the scene so much reminded me of hanging out with my dad. Horses are always getting into messes.


  After a lot of pushing and heaving, the horse was unstuck, and we had a delightful hour-long buggy ride through some of the prettiest countryside I have ever seen in Mississippi.


  Doug asked me to help give a penicillin shot to a beautiful young filly who had a nasty cut just above her front right hoof. It was a battle, but we got the shot delivered. This so reminded me of the old days at Tulley Stables and my dad.


  “You know, humans spent most of their history depending on horses for their transportation,” Doug said. “It was an intimate, interdependent relationship. And now what do we have? Cars. A machine. It’s changed who we are as human beings and not for the better.”
