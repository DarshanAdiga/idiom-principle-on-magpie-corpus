Our world lies torn and shattered, and all because of an invisible virus that probably was let loose by a horseshoe bat. In our understanding of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), one critical factor stands out. The destruction of wildlife and wildlife habitats led to its creation. It could be from Wuhan's horrific wet wildlife markets or experimenting with bats in a Wuhan laboratory or destroying bat habitats that led to a crisis where millions are infected and hundreds of thousands are dead.Intermediary species like the pangolin might have helped in mutating this virus and,over the last decade, humans have left no stone unturned to decimate pangolins and smuggle them live into wildlife markets. They could very easily have been the intermediary species.China is hugely responsible for the demand and needs to be shamed across the world. I squarely place blame on its actions. I watched closely its enormous role in the tiger crisis that enveloped India from the 1990s for two decades. I watched its increasing presence in Africa and the resultant decline in Africa's wildlife. At many international meetings for the last 30 years, it was warned to end its illegal wildlife trafficking and markets. It paid no heed. Many wildlife warriors fought to prevent China from this highly destructive role.But China, as a global economic power, cared little and plunged on regardless in its craze for wild animal parts and associated medicine. As far as I am concerned, this virus is a result of this. This virus is also a result of the actions of all those political and business leaders who did not care. All those who scoffed at and mocked nature's warriors, hurled abuse on those who served both wildlife and nature.The disrespect that many who serve nature have suffered is shocking. Many of us are now angry and unforgiving. Our warnings over the last 50 years have come true. We have tirelessly strived to prioritise the protection of our natural world. Very few who made policy or took decisions listened. Today, they should be drowning in guilt. Big business has failed nature. Few provide grants to protect it. Corporate leaders prefer to remain ignorant of the ways of nature. Now they have been hit where it hurts most. Trillions of dollars lost, and economies at a standstill. If we wake up from this nightmare, will they learn? Will they shed their arrogance? The less said about our politicians and bureaucrats, the better.I remember how hard I tried to get Prime Minister (PM) Manmohan Singh to create a department of forests and wildlife (which did not exist in the ministry of environment and forests) so that this essential sector was governed properly. The idea was to create a separate ministry over time and allow a ministry of environment and climate change to be independent of it. He agreed with my logic, (10 years ago), and instructed that it should be done. But a bunch of secretaries vetoed him. PM Narendra Modi has not held one meeting of the National Board of Wildlife in seven years. Nobody cares. They still do not realise that the virus they deal with originates in wildlife and is unleashed because of poor governance. They do not realise that India is in dire straits, the economy a mess and life disrupted because of how we deal with the natural world and its myriad species.Prime ministers, ministers, political leaders, bureaucrats, business leaders, and society must be educated, and fast, as nature's time bomb is ticking. This coronavirus is a warning shot over the bow. Next time around, nature will let loose a virus that will be much more virulent. This global pandemic could have come much earlier. It did not because of the tireless service of both nature warriors and wildlife warriors. These people come from all walks of life, in villages, towns and cities and spend their time passionately defending nature. Without them, we would have no world to live in. They provide the most essential service to the nation, but aren't recognised or respected. More often than not, they are relegated to oblivion. We need to remember all of them today and salute them.Who are these people? They are, among others, the 150,000 forest officers and forest guards. About 100,000 are scientists, wildlife watchers, wildlife travel promoters, wildlife hotel creators, wildlife photographers, wildlife filmmakers, writers, conservationists, naturalists, village volunteers and non-governmental organisations. We need to celebrate them when we are out of this crisis. The PM must brainstorm with them. You cannot run an economy without a healthy natural world. This virus reveals how easily economic collapse comes. Leaders of the world will have to put forests, wildlife and the environment on the top of the agenda if they do not want to be plagued with more disease and death.Economic recoveries must be green. No longer can we harm the natural wealth of our country or any country. This virus from Wuhan has proved that it can bring the world to its knees. That is the interdependence of the world today. Healing nature must be our call sign. Our leadership across this planet must wake up to a new era where life, the economics of it, the design of it are non-wasteful and non-exploitative and tempered with great respect for nature.Preventing global warming and the climate crisis must be immediate priorities. This virus has revealed how our planet is vulnerable and without healing nature, we, as a human race, will die. Let's learn our lessons and act hand-in-hand with the natural world. We need an educated and enlightened media that does its homework. We need urgent global meetings of world leaders on forests and wildlife. We need global decisions to close wet markets and wildlife trade. We need to find non-invasive solutions for our future. Enough of diplomacy; it is time to call a spade a spade. Enough of G7 and G20 meets. They need to be re-strategised in light of what has happened.Our mission today must be to create key strategies to protect natural ecosystems, wilderness and all the life that abounds in it. If we do not achieve this mission, there is no hope for our planet's future.Valmik Thapar has worked for 45 years with wild tigers.

Not classified but marked “for official use only,” the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by “denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data,” the analysis states.
 The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus “was a contagion” for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad — and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.
 Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China’s changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report.
 China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on Jan. 8.
 Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government’s missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information and officials hesitant to report bad news. There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world’s medical supplies.
 In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame U.S. intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Justice Department lawyer Erica Ross, who once served as a law clerk to Justice Elena Kagan, will be first up. She last argued at the court in late February. She's planning to deliver this Supreme Court argument, her sixth, from a Justice Department conference room.
 She will be followed by Lisa Blatt, a onetime government lawyer who will be arguing her 40th Supreme Court case. Blatt will be at her Washington-area home, she told The Washington Post.
 She is known for her colorful writing and speaking style and for her ability to engage in a healthy give and take with the justices. She was also a prominent liberal supporter of Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court.
 Each lawyer will get two uninterrupted minutes to make an opening statement, after which Roberts will kick off the questioning. After that, the justices will ask questions in order of seniority, although the longest-serving justice, Clarence Thomas, almost never questions lawyers. Kavanaugh, who joined the court in 2018, will go last.
 The court sometimes issues opinions at the start of argument sessions, with the justice who wrote for the majority reading a summary of the opinion and, more rarely, a second justice summarizing a dissent. But in another change wrought by the virus outbreak, opinions are being posted online without any statements from justices. The court will next issue opinions on Thursday.

The return of migrant labourers en masse from urban hubs of work to their villages is a primary area of concern, the Empowered Group, headed by Niti Aayog chairman Amitabh Kant, has noted in a progress report. Scores of NGOs are coordinating efforts and working closely with the district administrations and state governments so that measures of care, quarantine, and treatment go hand in hand, it added.
 The group had directed all chief secretaries to appoint state-level nodal Officers to coordinate with all NGOs and resolve their issues apart from leveraging their resources and networks.
 "Almost all States have appointed Nodal Officers to liaise with NGOs/CSOs.All Chief Secretaries were requested to instruct the District Administrations to leverage the bandwidth of NGOs and CSOs; Nominate Nodal NGO for each district, or groups of Districts for coordinating with the District Nodal Officer; and identify areas and sectors to stop duplicity and overlaps," it said.
 "NGOs were also urged to lift and distribute rice and wheat from the Food Corporation of India's godowns at the subsidized rate of Rs 21-22 per kg respectively so that no one in the country remains hungry," it added.
 The empowered group committee is monitoring and coordinating with the NGO and Civil Society Organisations across all states and 700 districts on a real time basis to fight the spread of Covid-19. It has engaged with Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, development partners, UN Agencies, and industry associations in over 15 meetings.
 "In the Aspirational Districts Programme piloted by NITI Aayog, as of now there are about 610 cases in 112 aspirational districts which is considered fairly low at less than 2% of the national level of infections," the empowered group said. Of these, six districts have reported the first case after April 21. Major hotspots are Baramula (62), Nuh (57), Ranchi (55), YSR (55), Kupwara (47) and Jaisalmer(34) it added.
 NITI Aayog has taken steps to ensure that these districts are able to contain the spread of the virus and has actively referred the requirements in testing kits, PPE and masks to the respective empowered groups for necessary action in order to address supply constraints, it noted.
 "Collaboration has been one of the guiding principles in Aspirational District Programme and these partnerships have enabled the District Administrations in ramping up isolation camps, setting up control rooms, door-to-door food supplies, distribution of cooked foods, mobilization of Self Help Groups for making home-made masks, sanitizers and re-usable & sterilizable protective gear while simultaneously sustaining their livelihoods during lockdown period. Osmanabad is one such district where a testing Centre has been established by utilizing the CSR corpus," it said.
 The empowered group has also mobilised these 92,000 NGOs across districts for monitoring and coordinating. "It is a record of sorts, to harness their strengths and resources, expertise in key social sectors-nutrition, health, sanitation, education, and extensive reach in the community," a Niti Aayog official said.
 The group has involved them in identifying hotspots and deputing volunteers; delivering essential services to the vulnerable, including the homeless, daily wage workers, migrants, and urban poor families; and in creating awareness about prevention, social distancing, and isolation.
 In the next phase, the group will mobilise CSOs and NGOs for movement against Covid-19 stigmatisation and in protecting the elderly and senior citizens. The UN in India has prepared a Joint Response Plan (JRP) with prevention, treatment and essential supplies as key components.
 "Skill building of 15,300 trainers, training for 3951 surveillance/ health officers on Integrated Health Information Platform, infection prevention and control training in 890 hospitals, support to ICMR for testing, strengthening risk communication and community engagement capabilities of healthcare workers, procurement of 2 lakh PPEs and 4 lakh N95 masks, have been initiated by WHO and UNICEF," the report said.
 The UN is also engaged in the procurement of medical supplies including ventilators (initially 1000 units as per the current requests, but potentially higher based on future demand) for 25 States. Further, an order of 10,000 ventilators and 10 million PPE Kits to UNICEF was expedited by group, it said.
 Niti Aayog has also engaged with the Indian Red Cross Society whose 40,000 volunteers are working with district administration in over 500 districts. It has created quarantine/isolation facilities at 33 locations, facilitated donation of ventilators, masks, PPEs, and test kits valued at Rs 5.50 crore, apart from relief and advocacy across the 500 districts, it added.
 The group has also urged all CSOs, NGOs, International Organisations and Industry partners to effectively utilise the Arogya Setu app in their operations. According to Niti Aayog, 80 million people have installed the app thus far.

Egypt has destroyed more than 3,000 tunnels along its border with the Gaza Strip in the past five years, Egyptian Army spokesperson Tamer al-Refai has revealed.
 In an interview with the private Egyptian news channel Extra News on Sunday night, Refai said: "In 2015, the [Egyptian] government took a decision to establish a buffer zone along the border [with the Gaza Strip]. These tunnels were used to threaten Egypt's national security, including the infiltration of terrorists, smuggling of weapons, ammunition, goods, narcotic drugs and vehicles. We established the buffer zone in stages because residents had to be relocated. They have received compensation."
 The Egyptian military spokesperson said that some of the destroyed tunnels were three kilometers long and 30 meters deep.
 Refai said that the Egyptian security forces were continuing their "heroic actions to defeat terrorists" in the Sinai Peninsula. He said that 126 terrorists were killed during the recent military operation there.
 During the operation, Egyptian security forces seized different types of weapons and explosive belts, he added. "We destroyed 630 explosive devices," he disclosed.
 Refai said that the Egyptian Air Force targeted and destroyed 228 hideouts and shelters used by terrorists. In addition, 116 four-wheel drive vehicles were destroyed and 266 suspects were arrested.
 "The [Egyptian] armed forces are working round the clock to combat terrorism and secure our borders," Al-Refai emphasized. "We have scored many achievements on the ground, including the destruction of the terror infrastructure."
 The announcement concerning the demolition of the tunnels along the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt came shortly after the Egyptians announced that 15 officers and soldiers were killed or injured during anti-terrorist operations in Sinai.

Ha chiarito ulteriormente che il test non sara effettuato a tappeto, ma solo ai donatori che avranno firmato il consenso informato. "Molto probabilmente avranno i risultati degli esami di idoneita nell'arco di qualche giorno, se la Regione mi da il consenso immediatamente puo darsi anche che impieghi qualche altro giorno per poter fare questi ulteriori esami, pero potrebbe passare anche una settimana o un po' piu di tempo. Ma nel caso non dovessero darmi l'autorizzazione mi dovro fermare. Sono stato molto chiaro". L'esame potrebbe essere inserito tra quelli di routine, insomma, ma potrebbe anche arrivare uno stop e saltare.

The coronavirus outbreak has left many people across Greater Manchester struggling for access to food, basics and other support. Many of them are self-isolating, often in fragile health and alone.
 Public services have been working hard to find and help them, but we know they are over-stretched and working round the clock.
 So the Manchester Evening News and the Greater Manchester Mayor's Charity have launched Covaid-19 - a fundraiser aimed at supporting those who most need help, from elderly people with no support network to homeless families living in hotels.
 The money will be distributed via the mayor of Greater Manchester's charity.

A special train with more than 1,000 pilgrims left Ajmer for West Bengal Monday morning as part of an exercise to evacuate stranded people, officials said.
 This is the third train to be operated by the North Western Railway (NWR) headquartered in Jaipur. Earlier, one train took 1,180 workers from Jaipur to Patna on around midnight on May 1. The second train went from Nagaur to Hatia in Jharkhand on Sunday with 905 workers on board.
 Monday's train from Ajmer to Dankuni in West Bengal left at 11:25am with 1,186 passengers.
 "These are pilgrims who were stranded in Ajmer since the lockdown was first imposed on March 24," said Sreya Guha, principal secretary of forest and environment and tourism departments and in charge of transfer of stranded people between Rajasthan and West Bengal.

 The pilgrims had come to visit the shrine of Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti and were stranded when the lockdown was announced to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
 The Dargah Committee, a management body for the shrine, said all stakeholders donated for rail fare of the pilgrims.
 "The Dargah committee, khadims (people who facilitate prayers) and Ajmer Sharif Diwan donated money to collect fare for the pilgrim. We gave Rs 825,660 to the railways," said Shakil Ahmed, nazim (secretary) of Dargah Committee.
 He said earlier the committee also paid for buses for sending 150 pilgrims to different parts of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.
 Al pilgrims were screened before they boarded the train.
 An official of NWR said no passenger on the special trains was charged fare; it was paid by the district administration. "We don't know where they raised it through donations or any other means; all that we know is the railways got the money from the district administrations for each train," he said, requesting anonymity.

Help from the federal government either has not been forthcoming, or can only scratch the surface of what tribal governments need to replace the revenue they are losing. Small tribes that don’t have casinos, but rent machines to tribes that do, also are losing money crucial to their budgets.
 Larger casino operations in the Puget Sound area are major economic engines for their people and those tribes and their employees are feeling the pain of shutdown.
 The Puyallup tribe’s gaming operations employ about 2,400 people. So far, 12% of those employees have been laid off and 73% are on furlough because of the pandemic, according to Michael Thompson, communications director for the tribe.
 Tribal government operations are already being pinched, with 600 employees on furlough, laid off, or working reduced hours.
 About 70% of the tribe's economic base comes from casino revenues, said David Bean, chairman of the Puyallup tribal council. Right now, the tribe only has enough money to continue its usual spending on tribal member benefits and services through June.
 It is not only the tribe that relies on casino proceeds. The tribe is one of the larger employers in Pierce County, Bean said, "and our nonnative relatives are hurting too."

Marine life rafts are small inflatable rescue boats designed to keep distressed passengers afloat. These small sized rafts are carried within larger ships and boats, deployed immediately whenever an emergency arises. Some of the marine life rafts, also known as rigid life rafts, are usually pressurized and contained within airtight canisters, conveniently placed at the outer deck of the ship, which aids in easy and faster deployment of the life rafts. Owing to tighter regulations formed over the years for the purpose of improving marine safety, life rafts are a common fixture on ships and boats. Its penetration rate is anticipated to improve in the upcoming years by increasing the minimum number of marine life rafts to be present in the ships. SOLAS or International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea is the prime regulatory body and treaty governing the usage of marine life rafts on ships and boats. The prime functional requirements of a marine life rafts include being able to withstand extreme weather conditions, be able to absorb impact loads, carry minimum rescue equipment as well as food and among others.

Carolina CoverTech makes 12,000 products that - as the company slogan says - "cover, protect, contain and enclose."
   
 But it wasn't until this month that the third-generation manufacturer made a product to cover and protect health care workers.
   
 The North Augusta-based custom fabricator - best known for producing commercial awnings, golf car fabrics and spill-control guards for the oil industry - is making disposable isolation gowns for University Hospital.
   
 With the COVID-19 pandemic draining the nation's supply of personal protection gear, the hospital called on CoverTech to produce a special run to help get it through the shortage.
   
 "Three weeks ago we had never made one, ever," CoverTech President Rian True said. "Now we're making 2,000 a day."
   
 Although the company and the hospital are less than 15 minutes apart, the idea of a supplier-customer relationship was something neither knew was possible.
   
 But when gown stockpiles started running low, University began searching for options while volunteers and staff cranked out up to 1,200 smocks a day using inexpensive sealing machines and plastic sheeting from home improvement stores.
   
 In a facility that disposes of 2,000 gowns a day, hospital officials predicted all inventory would be exhausted by the time the pandemic's predicted "curve" began its upward ascent. Mike Brown, University's director of materials management, offhandedly mentioned the dilemma to Greg Shuford, the pharmacy manager at University's Summerville campus.
   
 Shuford happened to know True, and he quickly put the two together.
   
 CoverTech operations manager Lisa Stuart said the plant started producing prototypes using existing material within a day of the first meeting.
   
 "We like people who come to us and need us to solve a problem," she said. "We can be agile and do things quickly."
   
 After a few modifications and switching the material to a textured plastic sheeting, the plant had created a gown that fit the hospital's needs. True said it took a little over a week to get the gown line up to full production.
   
 Brown said some of the hospital's nursing staff have mentioned they prefer CoverTech's smock to the ones sourced from the hospital's medical-equipment supplier.
   
 "They say its a little more durable," Brown said. "So they have managed to make a gown that is of equivalent quality and is a little more durable."
   
 The gowns, generally light blue in color, keep bodily fluids from contaminating health care workers' clothing and scrubs. The gowns are worn by all workers treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
   
 The colors of CoverTech's gowns vary based on the material it has on hand, something that hasn't been an issue for the hospital.
   
 "They didn't care about the color," True said. "They said it was all about taking care of their nurses and their staff."

 CoverTech workers cut gown patterns from stacks of plastic sheet and send the blanks to a workstation, where they are fabricated into shape using heat sealers. The company's more rugged industrial products - made from vinyl, acrylic and polyethylene-based specialty fabrics - are sewn or joined together using radio-frequency welders whose electromagnetic energy bonds material at a molecular level.
   
 Gown production has reached the point where CoverTech has been able to divert the overage to nursing homes and rural hospitals, True said.
   
 David Reed, CoverTech's product innovation manager, said it took a weekend of "trial and error adjustments" to get a mass-producible product that fit the hospital's budget.
   
 "We've had a couple of other products that we've had to turn around, but this was something different," he said.
   
 Reed said he enjoys designing products for all types of applications, but that the gown project was especially satisfying.
   
 "We feel like we're helping make a little bit of a difference," he said.

When casinos reopen for business will be a government-by-government decision, as tribal councils consider the best courses in their communities. The decision is up to tribal governments, not the state, because tribes maintain sovereign decision making on their lands.
 As at other businesses, tribes will implement a range of practices in their casino operations to slow the spread of the coronavirus, from reducing the number of gaming machines available for play to create social distance between customers, to putting up plexiglass shields between employees and patrons. Some might require staff to wear masks, and some might request it of patrons.
 Tribes that operate hotels will have to decide whether it is worth the extra cleaning costs to reopen — and how many rooms to make available for guests.
 The Stillaguamish Tribe intends to open its casino May 11, according to tribal chairman Shawn Yanity. For others, opening remains weeks away, or longer.
 Across the region, reopening will be gradual, and it will probably be 18 to 24 months before business is back up and running as before, said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe and chairman of the executive committee of the Washington Indian Gaming Association.
 “We are definitely in survival mode,” said Allen of Washington tribes. “Some tribes would like to open up now, but we don’t want to be the source that causes anyone to get sick from the virus. It is a calculated risk, when to open up, but we can’t wait for zero, there won’t be any economy left.”

"I bought a two litre bottle of Blenders Pride. The price printed on the label was Rs 1,600 but the vendor charged me Rs 2,000 and said "take it or leave it" when I protested," said a man.On Sunday, the UT Administration had allowed shops selling non-essential items, including liquor, to open. The order read, "Shops selling liquor, paan, gutka, tobacco etc will ensure minimum six feet distance (2 gaz ki doori) from each other, and also ensure that not more than 5 persons are present at one time at the shop."On Monday afternoon, UT excise department officials went into a huddle to address complaints of overcharging and issues of social distancing norms not being adhered to.

This system is vigilant to cues that signal the possibility of infection. When activated, it triggers strong cognitive, emotional and behavioral reactions to help you avoid pathogens - and the people and situations that may harbor them. Reactions such as the disgust you'd feel upon the sight of a decaying carcass, for example, reflect these evolved systems that motivate you to steer clear of germs.

I militari, insospettitisi perche la saracinesca risultava chiusa, hanno effettuato l'accesso al suo interno e hanno trovato il titolare 52enne intento a tagliare i capelli ad un cliente nonche ancora, ad un controllo piu approfondito, hanno "scovato" altri due avventori che, nella speranza di non essere notati, si erano rinchiusi dentro il vano bagno. Nei confronti del titolare, pertanto, e stata disposta la chiusura dell'esercizio commerciale, mentre i clienti sono stati sanzionati per aver abbandonato le loro abitazioni in assenza di valida motivazione.

In terms of the geographical reach of the marine life rafts market, it can be said that economies with larger coastlines are expected to have a larger market share. The market in the landlocked economies will be lesser but may rely on marine transport within the inner waterways such as rivers. The market for marine life rafts in the Asia Pacific region is anticipated for a healthy growth in the forecast period due to growing marine industry and transportation. This factor is also true for the Middle East and Africa region as well, in particular the Middle East region owing to improvements witnessed in its maritime cargo industry. The North American market is also anticipated for a positive growth due to tighter regulations placed around the mandatory instalment of such rescue equipment on board the ships and boats. Influx witnessed in the coastal tourism of the European region is anticipated to strengthen the growth of the marine life rafts market on a longer run in the future.

The West Indies team of the 1980s stakes a rightful claim to being one of the best ever in cricket’s history.
 Across 15 years, the West Indies had gone undefeated for 29 Test series. They seemed to have an assembly line of great batsmen and bowlers. As soon as one great would retire, another would step up to take his place.
 In the early 80s, there was a period when the West Indies went unbeaten for 27 matches – winning an incredible 17 of them, drawing the other 10. Their best period was between February 1981 and December 1989: in 69 Tests in that span, they had a 40-7 win-loss record. But between January 1990 and March 1995, they started losing a few – the record dropped to 20-9. Still, someone had to bring that incredible run to an end... someone, as they say, had to bell the cat.
 Such was their dominance in Test cricket that beating them became an ultimate status symbol. It was also something that drove the other teams to excel. That’s what the great teams do... they make everyone around them better.

“What stands out most about this class is how Georgia is much more active in their home state. Out of the seven commitments, six are from the state of Georgia. They will add more. How many is the question. In its home state, some of the top targets Mims, linebackers Barrett Carter and Smael Mondon, wide receiver Deion Colzie, Ferguson and Fairchild and defensive backs Nathaniel Wiggins and Green. Georgia is in pursuit of each of those, and I see the Bulldogs in the top three for each.
 “Yes, they are more active in the Peach State, but under Smart, Georgia has been a national power on the recruiting trail, and this year will be no different. They will pull in top recruits from all parts of the country. Foreman is the No. 1 player in the country, and the California native recently decommitted from Clemson. He is high on the Dawgs. Georgia will be busy in Florida too, with guys like safety James Williams, outside linebacker Dallas Turner and defensive lineman Leonard Taylor.
 “Georgia is No. 12 now, but do not let that ranking fool you. When we get closer to December, the Bulldogs will be back in the top five, and when all is said and done come February, Georgia will be battling for that No. 1 class for the fourth year in a row.” — _Chad Simmons, Southeast Recruiting Analyst_

The return of migrant labourers en masse from urban hubs of work to their villages is a primary area of concern, the Empowered Group, headed by Niti Aayog chairman Amitabh Kant, has noted in a progress report. Scores of NGOs are coordinating efforts and working closely with the district administrations and state governments so that measures of care, quarantine, and treatment go hand in hand, it added. The group had directed all chief secretaries to appoint state-level nodal Officers to coordinate with all NGOs and resolve their issues apart from leveraging their resources and networks. "Almost all States have appointed Nodal Officers to liaise with NGOs/CSOs.All Chief Secretaries were requested to instruct the District Administrations to leverage the bandwidth of NGOs and CSOs; Nominate Nodal NGO for each district, or groups of Districts for coordinating with the District Nodal Officer; and identify areas and sectors to stop duplicity and overlaps," it said. "NGOs were also urged to lift and distribute rice and wheat from the Food Corporation of India's godowns at the subsidized rate of Rs 21-22 per kg respectively so that no one in the country remains hungry," it added. The empowered group committee is monitoring and coordinating with the NGO and Civil Society Organisations across all states and 700 districts on a real time basis to fight the spread of Covid-19. It has engaged with Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, development partners, UN Agencies, and industry associations in over 15 meetings."In the Aspirational Districts Programme piloted by NITI Aayog, as of now there are about 610 cases in 112 aspirational districts which is considered fairly low at less than 2% of the national level of infections," the empowered group said. Of these, six districts have reported the first case after April 21. Major hotspots are Baramula (62), Nuh (57), Ranchi (55), YSR (55), Kupwara (47) and Jaisalmer(34) it added. NITI Aayog has taken steps to ensure that these districts are able to contain the spread of the virus and has actively referred the requirements in testing kits, PPE and masks to the respective empowered groups for necessary action in order to address supply constraints, it noted. "Collaboration has been one of the guiding principles in Aspirational District Programme and these partnerships have enabled the District Administrations in ramping up isolation camps, setting up control rooms, door-to-door food supplies, distribution of cooked foods, mobilization of Self Help Groups for making home-made masks, sanitizers and re-usable & sterilizable protective gear while simultaneously sustaining their livelihoods during lockdown period. Osmanabad is one such district where a testing Centre has been established by utilizing the CSR corpus," it said. The empowered group has also mobilised these 92,000 NGOs across districts for monitoring and coordinating. "It is a record of sorts, to harness their strengths and resources, expertise in key social sectors- nutrition, health, sanitation, education, and extensive reach in the community," a Niti Aayog official said. The group has involved them in identifying hotspots and deputing volunteers; delivering essential services to the vulnerable, including the homeless, daily wage workers, migrants, and urban poor families; and in creating awareness about prevention, social distancing, and isolation. In the next phase, the group will mobilise CSOs and NGOs for movement against Covid-19 stigmatisation and in protecting the elderly and senior citizens. The UN in India has prepared a Joint Response Plan (JRP) with prevention, treatment and essential supplies as key components."Skill building of 15,300 trainers, training for 3951 surveillance/ health officers on Integrated Health Information Platform, infection prevention and control training in 890 hospitals, support to ICMR for testing, strengthening risk communication and community engagement capabilities of healthcare workers, procurement of 2 lakh PPEs and 4 lakh N95 masks, have been initiated by WHO and UNICEF," the report said. The UN is also engaged in the procurement of medical supplies including ventilators (initially 1000 units as per the current requests, but potentially higher based on future demand) for 25 States. Further, an order of 10,000 ventilators and 10 million PPE Kits to UNICEF was expedited by group, it said. Niti Aayog has also engaged with the Indian Red Cross Society whose 40,000 volunteers are working with district administration in over 500 districts. It has created quarantine/isolation facilities at 33 locations, facilitated donation of ventilators, masks, PPEs, and test kits valued at Rs 5.50 crore, apart from relief and advocacy across the 500 districts, it added. The group has also urged all CSOs, NGOs, International Organisations and Industry partners to effectively utilise the Arogya Setu app in their operations. According to Niti Aayog, 80 million people have installed the app thus far.

That city residents love their tipple was evident from the long queues outside liquor shops opening after 41 days as the administration eased Covid-19 restrictions from Monday. However, even as social distancing norms were not followed in some places and complaints came in of overcharging, things remained peaceful across the city.
 In areas like Manimajra, shops had to be closed for some time to manage the crowds and ensure social distancing.
 Most of the shops had markings for people to stand apart and policemen kept a close eye on the proceedings.
 Buyers, however, complained that vendors were overcharging. "I bought a two litre bottle of Blenders Pride. The price printed on the label was Rs 1,600 but the vendor charged me Rs 2,000 and said "take it or leave it" when I protested," said a man.
   
   
 On Sunday, the UT Administration had allowed shops selling non-essential items, including liquor, to open. The order read, "Shops selling liquor, paan, gutka, tobacco etc will ensure minimum six feet distance (2 gaz ki doori) from each other, and also ensure that not more than 5 persons are present at one time at the shop."
 On Monday afternoon, UT excise department officials went into a huddle to address complaints of overcharging and issues of social distancing norms not being adhered to. The meeting had not ended by the time this report was filed.

MOREHEAD, Ky. (WKYT/Gray News) - The Trixie Foundation in Elliott County was advertised as heaven on Earth for pets, but more than 100 animals were pulled from the shelter this weekend, WKYT reported.State police have cited its founder, Randy Skaggs, for 12 counts of not meeting requirements for disposing of dead animals. Several dead dogs and cats were found in the facility’s freezer, according to an Associated Press report. More charges are pending.Over the weekend 104 dogs and four cats were rescued from the Trixie Foundation. Some are in better shape than others. One couldn’t even stand up.“She is beyond filthy. She is matted. She has advanced, advanced dental disease. It looks like her jaw is literally rotting out. She is blind and she is deaf, and she is caked with mud, so this little one has been laying there, waiting to die,” said animal advocate Julia Sharp, explaining the condition of one of the dogs she’s rescued. Sharp said Skaggs has managed the Trixie Foundation for 30 years. Questions about his treatment of the animals have surrounded him during that time. “Justice would be him in jail for the rest of his life,” Sharp said.She said this is just one example of a statewide issue. Kentucky has in the past been ranked the worst state for animal protection laws for 12 years by the US Animal Legal Defense Fund. Sharp said she won't give up fighting to make the state a safer place for pets."I have taken dogs so many times out of rescue, out of horrible conditions, and they get a slap on the wrist and nobody monitors this, and so it's got to change. It's got to change. This can't happen again," Sharp said.Still, advocates say that's why it's so important that Sharp and others at TLC Rescue are there. Now they need fosters to step up and help give these animals a second chance.Skagg, who faces trial in June for misdemeanor animal cruelty charges from 2018, said he neglected to bury the animals because of the heavy shelter workload, the Associated Press reported. He was not arrested and said he plans on fighting all charges against him.Copyright 2020 WKYT via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Lockdown rules will be analysed every three weeks. Number 10 says it will only lift or relax measures when the following five stipulations can be guranteed.
   1. Protect the NHS's ability to cope and be confident that the NHS is able to provide sufficient critical care across the UK   2. See a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates to be confident the UK is beyond the peak   3. Reliable data from Sage showing rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board   4. Confident that testing capacity and PPE are in hand with supply able to meet future demand   5. Confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak in infections which would overwhelm the NHS.
 It is understood the restrictions will be lifted in stages - with some businesses allowed to open and there is the potential that the public will be forced to wear facemasks outside their homes. Some social distancing measures could last until the end of the year.

These are hard times for everyone. There is no doubt about that. We are all struggling in our own ways. Small and large businesses are suffering in the midst of what experts predict will be our biggest recession in a century due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
   
 According to the Los Angeles Times, roughly 30.3 million Americans have filed unemployment claims in the six weeks since the coronavirus outbreak began. About one in six Americans have lost their jobs since mid-March, and economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20%.
   
 Make no mistake, everybody is hurting, even chambers. The first chamber of commerce in the United States was started in New York in 1758. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was established in 1912. Loosely defined, a chamber of commerce, sometimes known as a "board of trade" is an association or network of businesspeople designed to promote and protect the interests of its members.
   
 While tragic, this pandemic is an example of what chambers were built for: support. We keep our membership prices low and supplement operating expenses with income derived from our gracious Chairman Circle members, monthly meetings and our various annual events, which are all on hold to protect public health.
   
 But this gives us a chance to protect our local businesses - fulfilling our most important mission. We don't exist to raffle gift baskets. We exist to promote and protect the interests of the businesses in the communities of the High Desert.
   
 Since long before the worst of the consequences of the pandemic began to be felt by the business community we were scouring resources that could be offered to help when things got as bad as they are now. Regular emails to members have included free webinars for HR managers, information on coronavirus small business loans, CARES Act information, a guide to the employee retention tax credit and much more.
   
 We followed that up with a membership survey to learn more about the specific impacts that COVID-19 has had on our members so we could further mobilize resources. Visit www.VVChamber.com for a list of COVID-19 resources. We've also adjusted our membership options to help members and prospective members through these difficult times, from monthly payments to economic recovery grants to anniversary adjustments. We're doing our best to ensure you can continue providing your services.
   
 In my long chamber career, most of which was spent in Northern California, I've never encountered a place like the High Desert. Despite its growing population, it's hard to run across someone you don't know through some mutual acquaintance. It's a place where small businesses and startups can still thrive based solely on word of mouth.
   
 At the same time, we have corporate giants like Snapple, Rubbermaid, GE and ComAv that have decided to make the Victor Valley their home, providing thousands of jobs in doing so. Our local community colleges have created programs to specifically train our home-grown youth to work in good paying positions for these companies and raise the next generation of High Desert leaders.
   
 Our Board Chair, Jan Gonzales, raised her kids here and has risen to serve as the superintendent of the Victor Elementary School District. The chamber is here to help take care of those businesses that have taken care of our community.
   
 With so much already being lost to this tragic pandemic -- friends, loved ones, social freedoms -- we must not lose our local businesses, which are a significant ingredient in the glue that holds this community together. Please give your local chamber a call, even if you're not a member, we're here to help you get through this and thrive again when we are past this pandemic.
   
 Call the Victor Valley Chamber of Commerce at 760-245-6506. Call the Hesperia Chamber of Commerce at 760-244-2135.

For comparison's sake, you need to pay $4.99 for the full version of GeForce Now (no free games included) and Shadow costs a hefty $24.95 when billed annually (also no free games). There's a big difference with those services, however, in the sense that they're used to play games you already own on your computer through Steam, Origin, etc. On Stadia, you're limited to only playing games that are sold on the service — which as we've already noted, isn't a lot.

Well, that is still very much up in the air.

Un segnale di speranza dopo il lungo lockdown imposto dall’emergenza Coronavirus.      “Le riaperture sono la testimonianza di un forte impegno e coraggio imprenditoriale - dichiara Roberto Berio, presidente di Sanremo On - che deve essere però sostenuto a tutti i livelli dalle Istituzioni attraverso misure concrete e immediate”.      "Hanno già alzato le serrande la boutique per bambini di via Matteotti Albero Blu, il punto di riferimento per gli autoricambi Ostanel di via Roma e da oggi a pieno ritmo i grandi cantieri Permare.

It would have been overly optimistic for anyone to expect that the government would do away with all restrictions lock, stock and barrel on May 3. Given the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and its destructive course, this would not have been possible. The main takeaway from these fraught times is that this virus is now an inextricable part of our lives for some time to come and we need to work around this.As the third lockdown begins, the government has tried to ease things for people in several ways. Many restrictions have been lifted in the orange and green zones. Local administrations have been given the responsibility of deciding to what extent restrictions can be relaxed, depending on conditions in different areas. But, many would argue that this is not nearly enough.The decision to extend the lockdown was taken on May 1, Labour Day. This is a day to honour the contributions of the labour force but this time around, we could do little to ease their suffering and deprivation from job losses and their inability, in many cases, to get back to their distant homes. While we are proud of India's achievements as an emerging economy, the grim reality is that a huge percentage of its workforce lives under the pressure of economic uncertainties. They live in harsh conditions in slums around industrial townships and megacities. Now, the government has allowed them to go back home. Some of the shramik special trains have even reached their destinations. This brings hope for them during this difficult time. Hopefully, more measures, to ensure the safety and well-being of these workers, will follow. But what happens once these desperate people reach their villages? What are their avenues of income generation? There are only a few opportunities for them in villages, which prompted them to move out of the village in the first place, often leaving behind their families, to brave the harsh conditions of cities. They do this to make a life for themselves and support their families. Cities cannot do without them, and yet, their plight remains understated. Will there be opportunities for them?However, with every crisis, there is hope for a solution. The Covid-19 crisis seems to be an appropriate, even opportune, moment to revive India's artisan traditions, handicrafts and also rural agro- industries. This is the time for a renewed focus on the Make in India initiative. This may not generate jobs for everyone, but it will bring hope and long-term gain in rural India.Can villages be a big part of the new growth story? Despite the naysayers, a village-focused approach will bring about a turnaround. They often have interesting cultures and traditions that do not find a place in cities. There are many success stories about initiatives taken in our villages and mofussil towns. Let me relate one of these.A few years ago, in a village in Nainital, I was on my way to a market with a friend. When we reached the part of the road where the ascent began, my friend, who was older than me, ran out of breath. Both of us had to stop for a while. Within two minutes, a car that passed us, stopped at some distance. A charming young man, who turned out to be an acquaintance of my friend, approached us. He asked us where we were going. Luckily for us, our destination was the same as his. We got into his car and accompanied him to the market. En route, my friend introduced us. The young man had earlier worked in a multinational company, but left his lucrative job to return to his village and start a horticulture business, selling cut flowers. He ran a medical store there with his wife. He told me that while he was earlier an employee, he was now an owner. Now, many local men and women worked for him. I asked him how he accomplished this.His answer was philosophical. He said , "jo raasta gaon se shahar ko jaata hai, wohi raasta shahar se gaon ke lautta bhi hai" (the same road that goes to the city from the village, also comes back to the village from the city). I did not tell him that this was a famous dialogue from a popular television show. This young man was living the words articulated by the actor in the show. I thought to myself that new communication resources and expanding road networks opened up many paths for the younger generation. Now, they can get work on the Internet and deliver their products anywhere, by road, rail or air. This must continue, but for it to work effectively, there has to be greater synergy between people, their elected representatives and government policies.The crisis has begun and will continue to force us in the future to think innovatively. We have to decide for ourselves whether this pandemic is an unmitigated disaster or whether we can make the best use of the opportunities that will come in its wake. This is what will help decide which path India will take.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, HindustanThe views expressed are personal

Dozens of Rohingya refugees stranded at sea for weeks are being quarantined for coronavirus on a remote island in the Bay of Bengal after docking in Bangladesh on Saturday.
 The 29 refugees, mostly women and children, were taken to the cyclone-prone island Bhashan Char -- also known as Thengar Char -- in order to protect the sprawling refugee camps of Cox's Bazar from the spread of Covid-19, Bangladesh Naval Lieutenant Abdur Rashid told CNN.
 Cox's Bazar, home to nearly one million Rohingya refugees, has been in strict lockdown since early April -- only very limited movement is allowed within the squalid cluster of makeshift camps.

Avoiding sins is of higher priority and, perhaps, it is more important than these duas in some ways. These people do not commit sin in this month either. In the same sermon which was delivered by the Holy Prophet (PBUH), the Commander of the Faithful (A.S) asks the Holy Prophet (PBUH) which act is the most blessed act. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) answers, "Avoiding sins". Avoiding sins is of higher priority than Islamic obligations. It prevents one and one's heart and soul from being corrupted. These people avoid sins too. So, the blessings of Ramadan include fasting, reading the Holy Quran, engaging in dua and dhikr and avoiding sins. A combination of these things brings individuals close to achieving the things that Islam wants.
