“Clearly we have problems within the overall State System that need to be fixed. Financially it’s not sustainable as it is now. IUP has been losing money for years. The State System as a whole is expected to lose $39 million this year. How do you come up with that money without making changes?”
 The job losses portrayed as a wave of firings could be mitigated by early retirements of eligible employees, he said.
 “I think that there’s a way we can do this together, to help make IUP stronger for the future, without having such an adverse impact on the lives of individual staff members,” he said.
 After an often hard-nosed battle to stave off the effects of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the ongoing push for local voices to be heard in the pandemic response, Struzzi said the vote was overall approval of his service.
 “There’s a number of issues, but I think it’s the character and integrity of how I ran our office, the transparency and the communication,” he said. “I tackled every issue that I promised to tackle in 2018 when we ran the first time and we achieved a lot of progress toward those goals, but we still have a lot of hard work to do.”
 Semsick wished Struzzi well.
 “I left a message and I congratulated him,” Semsick told the Gazette about two hours after the polls closed. “All I’m saying is that the people spoke and that’s fine, I have no problem with that. I have watched what is happening and I’m not happy with what’s happening to small towns, low-income (people) and poverty, and that’s why I ran.
 “With this virus pandemic out there, it’s really hard to get the message out. But I have no regrets, I tried what I could and I gave it my best shot. So I hope Jim is able to help the people of Indiana County — and if not, I hope someone down the road will pick that ball up and run with it — but I did my best and I’m done.”
 Semsick described his campaign as “a calling,” and a one-shot deal that won’t be repeated in 2022.
 “We’re a small town and we don’t need the vindictiveness between parties,” Struzzi said. “I ran as I did last time to represent all the people of the 62nd District.
 “I’m honored that the people in the district value the hard work that I have put in, that my staff has put in these first two years. We truly care about the people we represent and try to do the right things for Indiana County and our collective future.”

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The death toll in last week’s Aegean Sea earthquake rose to 116 on Wednesday as rescuers in the Turkish city of Izmir finished searching buildings that collapsed in the quake.All but two of the victims were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city. Two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos, which lies south of the epicenter of Friday’s earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey registered the quake’s magnitude at 7.0, although other agencies recorded it as less severe.Mehmet Gulluoglu, head of Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, said search and rescue operations had been completed at 17 buildings that fell in Izmir. The rescue operation has been roaring at full tilt since Friday, pulling 107 survivors from the rubble.Of the 1,035 people injured in the quake, 137 remained hospitalized on Wednesday, the agency added. Following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged not to give up until the final person was recovered. Rescuers' spirits were raised Tuesday when they pulled a 3-year-old girl from the wreckage of her family home 91 hours after the quake.The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Some 1,700 aftershocks followed, 45 of which were greater than 4.0 magnitude.In Izmir, the quake reduced buildings to rubble or saw floors pancake in on themselves. Authorities have detained nine people, including contractors, for questioning over the collapse of six of the buildings.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and new buildings make of cheap or illegal construction that do not withstand earthquakes well. Regulations have been tightened to strengthen or demolish older buildings, and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities, but experts say it is not happening fast enough.The country sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

With time running out to get things sorted out before the lockdown and of Christmas, all types of businesses were reporting brisk business, sometimes on an unprecedented scale.
 “This has been the busiest day any of us can remember, but I’m not sure this is the right thing to do,” said Miri Buci, a 30-year-old barber at Dulwich Barbers in southeast London, which was staying open later than usual to cope with the increased demand. "What are we going to do if we don't get a vaccine? Lock down every few months?”
 Many lawmakers in Parliament, particularly from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, feel the same way and argued that the new lockdown is too draconian and will further devastate an economy that suffered one of the deepest recessions in the world during the first wave of the pandemic in the spring.
 Still, Johnson easily won a vote on the new measures later Wednesday as most opposition lawmakers backed the lockdown.
 “I don’t think any government would want to impose these measures lightly, or any parliament would want to impose these measures lightly on the people of this country,” Johnson said.
 England’s lockdown follows similar restrictions elsewhere in the U.K., which recorded another 492 COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday, the highest daily increase since May. Overall, the U.K. has Europe's highest official virus-related death toll: 47,742.
 It also follows fresh restrictions across the continent and clear signals that the number of people hospitalized — and subsequently dying — from the virus is increasing,
 The World Health Organization said European countries recorded a 46% increase in virus deaths compared with the previous week and were responsible for about half the 1.7 million cases reported around the world last week.
 In recent days, many European nations — including Belgium, Russia, France, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and the U.K. — have reported their highest daily virus death tolls in months, and sometimes ever. The pandemic has already caused more than 1.2 million confirmed deaths — over 270,000 of them in Europe, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll, due to missed cases and limited testing, is much higher.

SUMMERVILLE — With a deadline looming, election workers in Dorchester County must manually count some 14,262 absentee ballots after printing errors by a third-party vendor prevented those votes from being tallied by machine on Election Day.
 Poll workers are progressing in teams of four to copy the faulty ballots and scan their duplicates through counting machines before 10 a.m. Friday, when the election results have to be certified. Officials still don’t know how long that will take, though they acknowledge the process of double- and triple- checking the duplicate ballots for accuracy is time consuming.
 While the delay doesn’t appear to have affected the result of any Statehouse or congressional races, the printing errors have left in limbo the results of county races, including for three open seats on the Dorchester District 2 School Board.
 "It's disheartening," District 2 board candidate James Weaver said. "For a school board election especially."
 The Dorchester County Election Commission was unaware of the printing error until it began scanning mail-in ballots on Tuesday, putting the county on a tight timeline to rectify the problem.
 Sensing a heightened demand for mail-in voting this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, counties across South Carolina chose from a handful of pre-approved printing companies to print and — in some cases — mail their absentee ballots directly to voters.
 Dorchester was among nine S.C. counties that hired Sun Printing for the job after the West Columbia-based company was tested and approved by the S.C. Election Commission. Sun Printing had never printed mail ballots for voters before.
 The sample ballots Sun Printing sent to the Dorchester County Election Commission ahead of the election were tested and worked fine, officials told The Post and Courier.
 But county officials never saw the real ballots before they were sent out because Dorchester had hired Sun Printing to mail the ballots directly to voters, bypassing any further county oversight.
 That proved problematic on Tuesday, when county officials realized those ballots were printed with “timing marks” that were too small.
 Those rectangular marks, which are printed on the edges of the ballot, tell vote-scanning machines where the ballot starts, where it stops, and where the machine should look for votes. In Dorchester’s case, the rectangles had been printed one-eighth of an inch too short. Vote scanning machines would not read any of the county’s mail-in ballots.
 None of the other counties that hired Sun Printing saw the same error. But for Dorchester, it became a serious problem.
 There were only a pair of solutions. Either Sun Printing could reprint each of the ballots to fix the timing marks, or the ballots would need to be duplicated by hand.
 The State Election Commission vetoed the first option because it considers ballots that have already been marked by voters as sacrosanct and didn’t want the printing company to amend the original copies.
 “It doesn’t give you a warm and fuzzy feeling when you’re talking about taking voters’ ballots and printing on them,” State Election Commission spokesman Chris Whitmire said.
 That left option two — safer, but more time consuming.
 For Dorchester County, it means staffers must duplicate and count the ballots one by one.
 Working in teams, one worker will read each ballot’s selections out loud while a second person enters the votes onto a new ballot. Those two workers will then check the original and copy ballots to make sure they match. Then, two more staffers will review the ballots again to check them for accuracy before the new ballot is scanned and copied.
 "It's going to be a long process," Dorchester County Election Commission Director Todd Billman said. "Nobody touching the ballot has an interest in the outcome."
 In previous high-turnout elections, S.C. elections workers have had to duplicate dozens or even hundreds of ballots because they were damaged in the mail or otherwise couldn’t be scanned.
 Having to duplicate thousands of ballots is “unprecedented,” Whitmire said.
 “To our institutional knowledge, nothing of this level has ever occurred,” he said.
 The situation also highlights the crunch county elections offices were under to count more than 450,000 mail ballots this year. S.C. elections officials repeatedly asked for permission to begin processing those ballots in the days before Election Day so they could finish counting them by Tuesday night.
 S.C. lawmakers gave them just two extra hours Tuesday morning.
 "It's the day after the election in which (Dorchester is) starting this process," Whitmire said. "If we could open ballots earlier and start this process earlier, you'd find out (about errors) earlier and we'd be ahead of the game."
 Local politicians stick the blame squarely with Sun Printing. The company did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
 “The printer screwed this up,” said state Sen. Sean Bennett, a Summerville Republican who won re-election to a four-year term on Tuesday. “It wasn’t the county election folks. I have all faith and confidence in our director down here and what he’s doing with the staff and the volunteers.”
 By 9 a.m. Wednesday, the commission had seven pairs of workers duplicating and counting faulty ballots. Billman said they could bring in more workers to pick up the pace. They have about 40 people available, and the commission is checking to ensure counters don’t have any personal connections with any candidate on the ballots.
 Leaders of the local Republican and Democratic parties said they are less concerned about the delay than they are in making sure every vote is counted.
 “It’s an inconvenience, but it’s a small price to pay,” said Tim Higgins, chairman of the Dorchester GOP. “The focus right now is just on getting an accurate count.”
 Martha Hope, a representative from the county's Democratic Party, said Democrats don’t want people to panic.
 "In Dorchester, you can't call anything until 14,000 more votes get counted," she said.

In my time using the service itself, it works rather well! The UI both on the TV app and the iPad app I tested is basic, but it gets the job done.

The streaming quality was solid with only a skip or two in my time testing — par for the course when streaming live TV. The DVR function works just fine, but I don't like that it's limited to just 100 hours of content. That's probably no big deal, though, as the DVR interface is also extremely basic.

Hilinski won the backup job, but was supposed to sit and learn behind Jake Bentley. Instead, Bentley hurt his foot at the conclusion of the season opener. Hilinski went in and showed flashes, but dealt with elbow and knee issues through the season.
 He led the SEC in passes thrown per game, posting 2,357 yards, 11 touchdowns and five interceptions. His support was riddled by injuries at the end of the year, but he also showed plenty of the signs of being a first-year college player thrown into the mix.
 But for him, things are coming along.
 He said the game is slowing for him. He's seeing things happen differently, where the ball needs to go or what kind of throw needs to be deployed. Through the bye week, he got more work than usual, as did freshman Luke Doty, who Gamecocks coach Will Mushcamp said might have a special package the second half of the year.
 And as a quarterback who played early and then had to wait, Hilinski isn't alone in his experience.
 He said Bobo told him a story about his own early run as a starter before having to wait. Bobo was a sophomore on the top of the depth chart at Georgia in 1995 when a fractured knee sent him to the bench early.
 Hill started early in his freshman season, which ended with a torn ACL, then redshirted the next season after another knee injury. And then as a junior, he sat behind transfer starter K.J. Carta-Samuels, who was eventually benched.
 "We had a good conversation, kind of right after camp," Hill said. "Very similar situation my freshman year. ... It's one of those things -- you want to play. You're a competitor. You want to be out there. You've already had a taste of it, because you've been starting as a freshman. I just encouraged him to stay locked in and keep learning, because you never know when your number is going to be called, so you want to be ready for that.
 "At the same time, it's an opportunity to keep getting better. Coach Bobo tells us, you're not waiting on your opportunity. There are opportunities every day."
 When such an opportunity might come remains to be seen. Hill hasn't set the world on fire, but he's also not been notably bad. The offense has had its set of ills, few that seem directly impacted by who is behind center.
 Hill will have the chance to come back next season, or he could leave before a sixth year of college.
 And it leaves Hilinski working, developing, waiting, battling the natural sort of frustration while staying upbeat in his own way.
 "I trust the coaches, I trust the program, I trust the offense," Hilinski said. "You find yourself wanting to be out there, but I have an obligation to be ready if something ever happens or whatever the situation may be. I was a little frustrated at first (when Hill got the job), but the next morning, I woke up, went to practice and competed. I continue to do that every single day with a smile on my face."

Two weeks prior to Election Day, a California appeals court said Uber and Lyft must reclassify their drivers as employees rather than independent contractors in the state, affirming an earlier court decision as part of the ongoing lawsuit between the two companies and the state of California over the classification of their drivers.
 The state, which sued the companies in May, has argued that by classifying their drivers as contractors, Uber and Lyft deprive their workers of benefits they are entitled to under AB-5, which mandates that companies can only treat their workers as independent contractors if those people are free from company control and perform work outside the company's core business.
 In August, after a California court first ordered Uber and Lyft to reclassify their drivers in the state as employees, both companies threatened to shut down in the state if they were forced to reclassify their workers. The companies were granted a temporary reprieve as they appealed the ruling.
 The appeals court decision put added pressure on the outcome of the Prop 22 vote, which the gig companies have aggressively pushed to workers and Californians. (Uber was sued late last month by some of its drivers over alleged "pressure" to support Prop 22; the company called the lawsuit "absurd," and a California judge said last week that it is "unlikely that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on the merits," rejecting the drivers' request for an injunction order on Prop 22 in-app messaging.)
 Other legal battles in California are similarly challenging the classification of workers of the on-demand food and grocery delivery companies.
 The opposition to Prop 22, backed by labor and union groups, put in about $20 million into fighting the initiative, according to California Secretary of State records. But as Tim Rosales, a California-based political strategist, previously pointed out to CNN Business, "money does not always equal success" when it comes to ballot initiatives.
 "David can absolutely beat Goliath," he said, adding that "passing an initiative is always much more difficult than opposing an initiative."
 Robert Reich, a public policy professor at UC Berkeley and former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration who endorsed a No vote, told CNN Business last week that the outcome of the vote will be "very significant."
 "Uber and Lyft figure if they win in California they can win political fights in the rest of the states, and probably Congress," said Reich in an e-mail. "Labor unions recognize its importance as well. If Uber and Lyft win this, more employers around the country will classify more of their employees as contract workers. That would mean big savings to employers, since contract workers don't get Social Security or worker's compensation, minimum wage, or other labor protections. By the same token, workers would be disadvantaged."
 Veena Dubal, a labor law professor at University of California, Hastings, and a vocal advocate for labor rights, previously told CNN Business that the implications for labor could be much broader than the drivers covered by Prop 22. "There is a strong likelihood that if [Prop 22] passes, it would create lower labor standards across the board for the delivery and logistics industry," she said.

The number of Florida inmates who have tested positive for COVID-19 jumped to 113 on Sunday, more than doubling the tally of infections among prisoners over three days, according to figures released by the Florida Department of Corrections.
 Along with the 113 inmates, 80 corrections workers had tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Four inmates had also died, all of whom had been incarcerated at Blackwater River Correctional Facility, a prison operated by The Geo Group Inc, according to the medical examiner in Santa Rosa County.
 On Thursday, 44 inmates across the state had tested positive for COVID-19.
 The bulk of inmates who have tested positive are in three prisons: Blackwater River Correctional Facility in Milton, Tomoka Correctional Institution in Daytona Beach and Sumter Correctional Institution in Bushnell.
 Only the Daytona Beach and Bushnell prisons saw the number of inmates with COVID-19 soar during the past few days.
 At Tomoka Correctional Institution, 47 inmates had tested positive for the disease as of Sunday, a jump from seven cases reported by corrections officials on Friday. Meanwhile, Sumter Correctional Institution saw the number of cases among prisoners increase from three on Friday to 24 on Sunday, corrections officials said.
 Florida Department of Corrections officials are prioritizing the distribution of cloth face masks to corrections workers and inmates at the Sumter and Tomoka correctional facilities, according to a statement issued by the agency on Sunday.
 In light of the dramatic increase in cases at Tomoka, about 60 healthy inmates have been transferred to Columbia Correctional Institution, where a single corrections worker has tested positive for the virus, officials said Sunday.
 Corrections officials have not announced similar plans for healthy inmates housed at Sumter Correctional Institution.
 As the coronavirus spreads in Florida’s prison system, which has 145 facilities and roughly 94,000 inmates and 23,000 workers, 4,033 inmates throughout the state had been placed in medical isolation or medical quarantine after being exposed to the highly contagious virus.
 The vast majority of the inmates who had been exposed --- 3,944 cases --- were in medical quarantine, a practice used to separate people who came into close contact with others who tested positive for the virus or who were symptomatic, corrections officials said. The remaining 89 inmates were in medical isolation because they were suspected of having the virus or have been diagnosed with it, officials said.
 COVID-19 has been detected in 56 corrections facilities and four probation offices throughout the state. As of Sunday, 361 Florida prisoners had been tested for the virus, with 22 percent of test results pending, according to corrections officials.
 The number of tests that had been performed encompassed about 0.4 percent of the state’s roughly 94,000 inmates.
 While corrections officials said 80 workers had tested positive, the agency has not disclosed how many employees are awaiting test results or tested negative for the virus.

Tom Wolf wasn’t up for another term Tuesday and his name wasn’t on the ballot, but the election for seats in the General Assembly was as much a rebuke of the Pennsylvania governor as it was the endorsement of local level Republicans for the Legislature.
 Pa. Rep. Jim Struzzi, R-Indiana, easily outdistanced Democratic challenger Dennis Semsick, of Pine Township, in Election Day balloting and earned a second two-year term in the state House. His campaign was heavy on echoing residents’ discontent with Wolf’s single-handedness in regulating Pennsylvania’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. And Struzzi invested political capital leading a legislative fight for a voice against Wolf’s unilateral inclusion of the state in a regional compact that’s feared to cripple the energy industries in Indiana County.
 It paid off.
 Struzzi earned 16,320, or 78.9 percent, of votes cast Tuesday in the 43 precincts that are part of the district. Semsick had 4,337 votes and a deficit that is statistically unlikely to be overcome when absentee and mail-in ballots are all counted.
 Struzzi, in a second term, looks to renewing a fight for recognition of the threatened closings of regional electric generating station and the loss of jobs at the power plants and coal mines that fuel them.
 “I think we need to continue to try and work with the administration to help them understand the impacts of RGGI on Indiana County and the entire commonwealth,” he said. “It frustrates me that they’re solely focused on the impacts related to the climate without considering the economic impact and I think that’s the wrong approach.
 “In the big picture, Pennsylvania needs to focus on getting its economy back to where it should be. We need to look at how we treat business, how we treat the energy industry. We have tremendous assets that we punish for being successful and that’s not conducive to a successful vibrant economy.”
 Struzzi hoped that the election would signal a united approach by Harrisburg in contending with the impact of the pandemic.
 “The politicization of the whole COVID thing was frustrating and I hope that goes away now so we can focus on getting everyone healthy, getting beyond the pandemic and get back to focusing on important legislation that moves Pennsylvania forward,” he said.
 Late campaign season criticism came from those who suggested that he hadn’t strongly responded to the just-announced plan to eliminate certain courses and majors and to reduce the teaching staff at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
 The plan in place, Struzzi said, won’t singly bring the harm to IUP that some have lamented.

In San Francisco, Harry Rochester, who voted for Joe Biden for president, said he was sad when voters banned affirmative action.
 "Being an African American man in America, I don't think I would have gotten as far as I have gotten today if it wasn't for affirmative action," said Rochester, 40.
 Mark DiCamillo, director of a poll conducted by the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, said he was puzzled by the lack of support for the measure.
 The IGS survey of likely voters released Oct. 26 shows 49% opposed and 38% in favor. A poll by the Public Policy Institute of California indicated similar trends.
 "My only explanation is that it's fallen between the cracks," he said.
 Lawmakers placed Proposition 16 on the ballot following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police. They pointed to his death as clear evidence of the barriers that hold back Black Americans and other people of color.
 The coronavirus pandemic also has highlighted stark inequities among minority groups in health care, education and wages.
 California voters banned affirmative action in 1996 through a ballot measure that was pushed by the Republican governor at the time, Pete Wilson. The most populous state in the country is more diverse and less Republican than it was 24 years ago.
 Latinos make up 39% of the state's population, followed by white people at nearly 37%, Asian Americans at almost 17% and African Americans at under 7%. The percentage of Republicans in the state has dropped from 36% in 1996 to 24% now.
 The U.S. Supreme Court has long outlawed racial quotas, but it has ruled that universities may use tailored programs to promote diversity.

Hamilton agreeing to the CGF's request to switch from 2030 to 2026 gave the southwestern Ontario city preferred candidate status for the latter.
 Hamilton had leeway to scale down its games plan in size and cost. A proposed capital and operations budget of $1.5 billion for 2030 dropped to $1 billion for 2026.
 The number of sports dropped from 22 to 18 and participating athletes, coaches and officials from 6,750 to 5,500.
 Economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was pitched as a primary benefit in pursuing an earlier games.
 Hamilton's initial 2030 bid had support in principle, but not financial commitment, from the federal, provincial and municipal governments.
 The feds have indicated a willingness to support a 2026 bid, but Hamilton city council approval can't be sought before the province signs on.
 Hamilton's bid committee is therefore in limbo awaiting word on which games it is chasing in what year.
 "Our resolve with respect to potentially accelerating the gains from the bidding structure of 2030 was entirely focused on pandemic recovery and the investment that would come with the games," bid committee spokesman Louis Frapporti told The Canadian Press.
 "It's a question of having the investment and having the event as soon as practicable.
 "So we're going to defer to the province and the federation to continue their discussions to see whether they can work out an arrangement, whatever that might be."
 Hamilton initially pursued 2030 because it would mark of the century anniversary of the city hosting the first edition of the Commonwealth Games, then called the British Empire Games, in 1930.
 Reverting to a 2030 bid is an option, Frapporti said, but Hamilton could again lose out to another city in a multi-bid race.
 "The risks associated with competing, along with the costs, is not remotely as attractive a proposition as a highly-modified games centred on pandemic recovery," Frapporti said.
 "It's a beautiful, wonderful bird in hand or two very elusive birds in the bush if I can put it that way . . . from the perspective of accelerating benefits to a region that is desperately in need of some good news, investment, employment, optimism, hope, having the certainty of the games earlier, rather than having to compete some time down the road for 2030."
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 4, 2020.

Police said the complainant Shrinath Ayodhay Sonath, 41, a residence of Vashi, is an Ola cab driver. In his statement to the police, the complainant said that he met the accused who were posing as customers, in September. "The accused claim that their aunt used work as the caretaker to a businessman and had received US dollars from him. They wanted to exchange the foreign currency and needed help. Sonath agreed to exchange the currency in the hopes of making a profit. He gave ₹2 lakh to the accused who then took the money and fled," said an officer from Shil Daughar police station. The Shil Daighar police have registered a case under sections 420 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). "We arrested the accused on October 31. They are in police custody till November 6.

Following multiple complaints of unidentified gas leaks in the city over the past year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to procure air analyser balloons to help detect the source of such leaks. The civic body plans to deploy these balloons in the island city as well as the eastern and western suburbs.
 Air analyser balloons, which cost ₹45 lakh each, collect samples of air that can then be sent to be analysed in laboratories to identify the gas. Knowing the gas would help identify the source of a leak.
 "These balloons are sent up in the air to collect the air in the atmosphere and then, they can be retrieved and the air can be tested. The equipment is a portable unit and can be mobilised quickly after complaints," said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (disaster management). "Once the gas is identified, it will narrow down our search. We can then specifically look for entities or transporters who deal with that kind of gas," he said.
 In the past year, there have been three incidents when Mumbaiites reported gas leaks, but no source was identified despite the authorities alerting petrochemical factories (mostly in Chembur) to check their premises. Citizen complaints came in from Chembur, Ghatkopar, Govandi, Kanjurmarg, Vikhroli, Bhandup Mulund, Andheri and Goregaon.
 A probe panel with experts from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), the fire brigade, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), University Institute of Chemical Technology (UICT) and petrochem representatives was set up by BMC, but its findings were inconclusive. The panel suggested collection and testing air samples.
 A senior civic official said that a proposal for air analyser balloons is being prepared and will soon be tabled at the standing committee meeting for final approval.
 Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition and Congress corporator, said, "There needs to be a sub-department under BMC's disaster management cell for gas leaks specifically. There are hundreds of tankers carrying hazardous chemicals that ply within the city daily. They are parked anywhere and it could be disastrous. The civic administration should focus on regulating the functioning of chemical tankers."

Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union, tweeted a picture of the so-called Brooks Brothers riot of November 2000, when Republican operatives and lawyers stormed a meeting of Florida election canvassers in an effort to stop a ballot recount in Miami-Dade County.


  Schlapp, who was a leader of the 2000 protest, used the hashtag “StopTheSteal” on Wednesday, bolstering Trump’s evidence-free claim of fraud in the ballot-counting process.


  “My experience from the Florida recount is that every legal vote should count but there needs to be 100% compliance to make that ballots — especially early, absentee, vote mail vote — is faithful to the letter of the law, especially in terms of when the ballot was cast,” Schlapp said in a telephone interview.

 But based on the current figure, Balter would need to win 88.45% of the absentees to defeat Katko in the 24th district. That means Balter would need to win 63,380 of the 71,656 ballots.
 Here's why that's unlikely: We know that about half of the ballots were returned by Democrats. But about one-quarter of the ballots were returned by Republicans. The remaining 25% or so are minor party voters or voters who aren't enrolled with a party.

Lantigua comentó que el año que viene la United World Wrestling (el organismo internacional de lucha olímpica) tiene pautado un torneo en febrero, en Roma, Italia, y otro para abril en Bulgaria.
 Ambos son clasificatorios para los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio en 2021.
 “Eso si la pandemia lo permite”, señaló Lantigua. “Todo es un panorama cambiante y no todo está en nuestras manos. En abril es la última oportunidad para clasificar a las Olimpiadas”, sostuvo Lantigua.
 Gómez ya tiene ponchado su boleto a Tokio, mientras que Ethan Ramos, Evan Ramos y Nesmarie Rodríguez buscan asegurar su clasificación.
 “La pandemia le ha dado bien duro a nuestro deporte. Nosotros estamos en la última línea de abrir el país. Todavía es la hora que no nos han dejado entrenar entre nosotros. Desde marzo yo no he podido dar una clase de lucha porque la lucha conlleva eso: luchar. No es solamente hacer ejercicios y desplazamientos”,
 “Jaime (Espinal) y Franklin están afuera y han podido practicar un poco, pero tampoco al 100 por ciento. Han podido practicar dos o tres días, luego alguien da positivo al Covid y tienen que parar la práctica nuevamente y así sucesivamente”, dijo. “La pandemia ha sido un golpe bien duro”.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Disappointed Democrats drove Wednesday toward extending their control of the House for two more years but with a potentially shrunken majority as they lost at least seven incumbents and failed to oust any Republican lawmakers in initial returns.By midmorning on Wednesday, Democrats' only gains were two North Carolina seats vacated by GOP incumbents after a court-ordered remapping made the districts more Democratic. Though they seemed likely to retain House control, their performance was an unexpected disappointment for the party, which hoped for modest gains of perhaps 15 seats.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., talks to reporters about Election Day results in races for the House of Representatives, at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2020. She was joined on a video call by Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ()After decades of trying, Republicans defeated 15-term Rep. Collin Peterson from a rural Minnesota district that backed President Donald Trump in 2016 by 31 percentage points, Trump’s biggest margin in any Democratic-held district. Peterson, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, opposed Trump’s impeachment and is one of the House’s most conservative Democrats. He was defeated by Republican Michelle Fischbach, the former lieutenant governor.In Iowa, GOP state Rep. Ashley Hinson defeated freshman Democratic incumbent Abby Finkenauer to win a hard-fought race for the state’s northeastern congressional seat. Hinson is a former television news anchor.Also losing were freshmen Democrats Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala, health secretary under President Bill Clinton, in adjacent South Florida districts where Trump seemed to consolidate support among Cuban voters. Others defeated were Democratic freshmen Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico and Kendra Horn in Oklahoma, who had surprising victories in 2018 in districts Trump carried decisively in 2016.The fight for Torres Small’s seat cost around $35 million, making it one of the country’s most expensive races, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. She was defeated by Yvette Herrell, a former state legislator.Democrats were also disappointed in the Senate, where they nursed fading hopes of winning the majority. Trump’s challenge from Democrat Joe Biden remained too close to call.Before votes were counted, both parties' operatives said the GOP would be fortunate to limit Democratic gains to a modest single digits. Democrats control the House 232-197, with five open seats and one independent. It takes 218 seats to control the chamber.A smaller Democratic majority would make it tougher for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to unite her lawmakers as a handful of progressive freshmen arrive for the new Congress.By retaining House control, Democrats would mark only the second time in a quarter century that they’ve led the chamber for two consecutive two-year Congresses. The first period ran from 2007 through 2010, when Pelosi was serving her first four years in her post.“Our purpose in this race was to win so that we could protect the Affordable Care Act and so that we could crush the virus,” Pelosi told reporters, citing former President Barack Obama’s health care act. She declared that Democrats had won the House majority, which seemed highly likely but hadn’t been officially declared by The Associated Press.Democrats' hopes of protecting their majority and even expanding it were based on public anxiety over the pandemic, Trump’s alienation of suburban voters and a vast fundraising edge. But those advantages didn’t carry them as far as they’d hoped.With GOP expectations for capturing the House all but nonexistent entering Election Day, Republicans were happy with the results.“House Republicans have outperformed all expectations,” said Dan Conston, who heads the Congressional Leadership Fund, a committee aligned with House GOP leaders that provides millions to Republican candidates.Democrats lost a majority Hispanic district in West Texas they expected to win when the GOP incumbent retired. And they lost a series of what seemed coin-flip races, failing to defeat GOP incumbents in Cincinnati, rural Illinois, central Virginia and the suburbs of St. Louis and Texas.In a district between Austin and San Antonio, freshman GOP Rep. Chip Roy withstood a challenge from Democrat Wendy Davis. Davis gained fame as a state legislator by waging a 2013 filibuster against an anti-abortion bill, then lost a race for governor the following year. The conservative Club for Growth made her its biggest target, spending over $6 million against her this year.As if symbolically, Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was in her own tight race in a closely divided district she won by 24 percentage points in 2018.Some endangered Democratic freshmen like Texas' Lizzie Fletcher, Georgia’s Lucy McBath and New Jersey’s Tom Malinowski and Andy Kim held on.But the party notched no victories in long-shot races they’d hoped would bolster their majority. Republicans retained such districts in central North Carolina; Montana; Omaha, Nebraska; and around Little Rock, Arkansas.As Wednesday morning progressed, other hotly fought races remained undecided in Indiana and Virginia.Scores of both parties' incumbents from safe districts were easily reelected. These included progressive star Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez in New York City and both parties' No. 3 House leaders, Democrat James Clyburn of South Carolina and Republican Liz Cheney of Wyoming.Also coming to Washington will be New York City area Democrats Jamaal Bowman, a progressive who was backed by Ocasio-Cortez, and Ritchie Torres, who will be Congress' first openly gay Hispanic.In one noteworthy but unsurprising result, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has espoused unfounded QAnon conspiracy theories, won a vacant seat in northwest Georgia. Trump has called Greene a “future Republican star.” QAnon asserts that Trump is quietly waging a battle against pedophiles in government.Hanging over the contests were the coronavirus pandemic and the wounded economy, which voters ranked as top concerns, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate. The virus has killed 232,000 people in the U.S. and cases are rising in nearly every state, while millions have lost jobs.Buoying Democrats was a coast-to-coast edge in campaign fundraising, including for all 29 Democrats from districts Trump won in 2016 and Republicans were targeting. By early Wednesday, Peterson, Cunningham and Torres Small were the only ones of those Democrats who’d lost.Nearly all Democratic incumbents in potentially vulnerable districts were outspending their GOP challengers, often by vast margins, according to an AP analysis of Federal Election Commission campaign reports.As in 2018 when they grabbed House control, Democratic ads emphasized pledges to make health care more accessible, preserve coverage for pre-existing conditions and shield voters from Republicans out to terminate those requirements. Many Republicans say they want to dismantle Obama’s health care law while retaining its coverage for pre-existing conditions, but they’ve not presented a detailed proposal for doing that.The pandemic has only amplified Democrats' focus on health care. Trump’s repeated false statements downplaying the virus' severity have also given Democrats political fodder.AP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 127,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.___Find AP’s full election coverage at APNews.com/Election2020.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

 # Detroit's Proposal N blight-remediation bond heads toward passage
 Sarah Rahal
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 _Detroit_ — As the city's $250 million bond proposal heads toward passage Wednesday, Mayor Mike Duggan said he knew it would pass by "a big margin."
 With 500 of 637 precincts reporting, the 30-year bond issue — Proposal N, as in neighborhoods — was receiving a 70% "yes" vote Wednesday morning.
 Within weeks, the Duggan administration intends to launch a five-year plan to tear down and rehabilitate thousands of blighted homes, he said during a noon press conference.
 "We came together and we found the same thing we've always found, which is enormous support for the people of this city to vote by more than a 70% margin," Duggan said. "It's an enormous vote of confidence in the administration and we're going to go to work."
 They'll start with securing homes headed for renovation and tearing down blighted homes that sit between two occupied homes, Duggan said, "to have the maximum impact on the folks in this town who go to sleep every night worrying that the house next door is going to catch fire and spread to them."
 A divided Detroit City Council voted 5-4 in July to put the controversial measure before voters that would dedicate $160 million toward razing 8,000 blighted houses and $90 million for renovating 8,000 others that are vacant but structurally sound. The city also committed to goals of awarding more than half of all contracts associated with the work to Detroit companies and giving residents first dibs on salvaged homes.
 The city, faced with looming pension obligations coming due in 2024 and the recent reallocation of blight dollars to combat a pandemic-induced $410 million shortfall in the current and last fiscal budget, doesn't have dollars to spare, said Detroit's Chief Financial Officer Dave Massaron.
 Massaron previously noted if the market holds, Detroit will aim to borrow a large part of the blight bond funding early to take advantage of historically low rates.
 Detroit's general fund resources for blight, he said, are "extremely limited" and officials adopted a four-year financial plan without any funds for the demolition department in the 2022 fiscal year.
 The bond issue has proven to be controversial, as opponents from the Call 'Em Out Coalition urged voters to reject the plan, arguing that city officials can't be trusted to handle taxpayer dollars.
 In October, Duggan and a group of Detroit City Council members unveiled a resolution to give residents potentially impacted by over-assessments between 2010 and 2013 priority in affordable housing, discounted purchases of land bank homes and job training.
 Arthur Jemison, Detroit's group executive of Planning, Housing and Development, previously told The News the plan would mean rehabilitation and demolition work from border to border.
 Rehab attention will immediately be focused on place like Maple Ridge and Osborn area in northeast Detroit, greater Conner Creek, State Fair Avenue north to Eight Mile, and a section of the west side near Nardin Park and Brightmoor.
 Duggan touted Detroit City Council, which will have oversight over the program, and LaJuan Counts, head of Detroit's Demolition Department.
 "Anytime you're doing 16,000, different projects you're going to have some things go wrong, but LaJuan managed to board up 30,000 houses," Duggan said. "We will move on and I just want the people in the city to know that deeply appreciate the support.
 "I knew it was going to be a big margin," he said, also thanking 5,000 people who aided in Election Day tabulations.
 Nicole Small, the City Charter Commission’s vice chairwoman, claims there were many residents who submitted their ballots for the bond without knowledge of details.
 "The mayor put a lot of money into it and manipulated Detroiters into thinking that their taxes wouldn’t be impacted, but that it would help sustain the community," said Small, who voted against the bond.
 "No one expected this to be fair and transparent, but we’ll wait and see."
 Small said among the coalitions that opposed the bond, they’ve assembled a plan to "make sure we monitor and hold this administration to account."
 Among those most vocally in support of the bond program were councilmembers Roy McCalister, Andre Spivey, Janee Ayers, Scott Benson and Gabe Leland.
 McCalister, who said the council fought for more oversight to gain the public's trust, said things won't be run as they used to.
 Had Proposal N failed, he said, homes that could be revitalized or knocked down would have weathered the storm for another year, and by then, "It might be to the point where we're tearing down more houses than we can save."
 Benson said Proposal N passage placed Detroit squarely on the path to promise and prosperity.
 "Parents can feel more confident about the safety of their children and seniors can feel safe in their homes again. Young people can move back to the city into newly rehabbed homes to raise their families," Benson said.
 In her five years on the council, Ayers said the top concern at community meetings consistently regards blight in neighborhoods.
 "Reducing blight not only improves the aesthetics of our city, but leads to a reduction in crime and an increase in value for our neighborhoods," Ayers said. "As chair of the budget committee, I am committed to diligent oversight of the implementation of this proposal and look forward to its positive impact on our city."
 In the same press conference, Duggan mentioned he expects Democratic candidate Joe Biden to carry the state by at least 50,000 votes and thanked the Court of Appeals for striking down a temporary restraining order over the Amazon deal at the former Michigan State Fairgrounds.

On March 20, 1854, a group of anti-slavery activists met in a one-room schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin. They formed a new political party at that meeting and called themselves Republicans.
   
 That schoolhouse is generally considered the Republican Party's birthplace, though that's disputed. Momentum was building across the country. Six years later, Abraham Lincoln was elected the country's first Republican president. Five years after that, the Civil War ended, and so did slavery.
   
 This year I cast yet another "protest" vote in the presidential race - not really for a candidate, but against the two major parties and their policies. There were 11 other names on the ballot in Arkansas, and I chose the Libertarian even though that party does not really reflect my views.
   
 The Electoral College makes an individual's vote mean little in a solidly red state like Arkansas. President Trump was going to win this state. I used my little vote to try to help the Libertarians reach 3% so they could qualify for the ballot here in 2022.
   
 This was the fifth time I cast a vote for a third party or independent presidential candidate. All have been protest votes except perhaps the first in 1992 when I voted for Ross Perot. He was temperamentally ill-suited to be president, but he had run a campaign where he actually explained a challenging issue, the national debt, and offered concrete solutions. At the time, the debt was $4 trillion. Today it's more than $27 trillion.
   
 I am tired of casting protest votes. Like those people in Ripon in 1854, I want to vote for something.
   
 The party I want to vote for would be centrist, pragmatic and fiscally responsible. It would not assume the government is the solver of all problems, but it would not declare that government is always bad or pretend that it's going away.
   
 It would do what is necessary to balance the federal budget once this pandemic is over, which means it would cut spending where it can and increase tax revenues where it must. It would seek to enact a legal mechanism that encourages a balanced budget.
   
 This party would balance the budget because one of its guiding principles would be creating a better America and a better world for future generations - not simply living for today and the next election. That means it would prepare for the next pandemic, invest in cures and treatments for viruses ahead of time, go to war now against cancer, and take seriously the threats of climate change and plastics pollution.
   
 It would support political reforms such as term limits, campaign finance transparency, and ranked choice voting. It would never forget that ensuring free, fair and competitive elections is more important than whoever happens to win the next particular one.
   
 It would at least try to unite the country rather than divide it into groups to be pitted against each other. It would let the culture war be fought more often in the culture and at the state level, which means it would be OK with Arkansas and California being different.
   
 Finally, its nominees would not forget that truth exists, despite the fact that individual humans are imperfect interpreters and communicators of it. Sometimes the truth is, "I don't know." Sometimes it's, "I was wrong, and now I've changed my mind."
   
 And the truth is also this: "Virtually all policies create winners and losers, and ours are no different. We're open to others' ideas."
   
 In short, I'm looking for a party where someone like President Dwight Eisenhower would fit in, and maybe Sen. Bob Dole. He's 97 and too old to run. Well, maybe he wasn't this year.
   
 I recognize this column is somewhat pie in the sky. A political party is a collection of individuals who can be both noble and self-interested. Mine would argue and squabble like any party does. Once it gained power, it eventually would be corrupted.
   
 Then it might be time to start another one. But before it became corrupted, maybe it at least could balance the budget a few times.
   
 Sometimes it's just time to shake up the system. A lot can happen when a few people try. It did 166 years ago, starting, at least in part, in a one-room schoolhouse.

According to Kofi Koranteng, who was running as an independent presidential candidate prior to his disqualification, the claims of forgery in his nomination documents by the Electoral Commission, is unbelievable.      “It is obvious the Electoral Commission (EC) was determined by any means necessary, to make sure my name was off the ballot paper,” he told host of Angel FM’s ‘An)pa B)fo)’ morning show, Captain Smart on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.      Expressing displeasure over the anomalies, Mr. Koranteng said he made the necessary corrections when he was informed about the errors in the entry, yet he was denied having his name on the ballot paper.      Mr. Koranteng believes it was a deliberate and sabotaged act on the part of the EC because, the Chair, Mrs. Jean Mensa, took a hasty generalisation.

When we were filming JOEY, Jen was producing that weekend, she did all of the flower arrangements (yes people, she is also a part-time florist), and to boot she played a wedding guest in the film. Our day was ambitious to say the least, but as Jen always does, she found pace and balance in the midst of chaos that is indie filmmaking, grounding everyone around her. She smiled her way throughout the rainy and cold day, reassuring us when necessary, finding solutions when there were problems. Not to mention bringing us hot soup as we were racing against time (literally) to capture the last shot of the day. So perhaps she is a magician and this is an obvious but true statement. Jen makes the team, a dream.

Since the show is all about the subject, the truth is that it was my own expectations that were out of whack with what the show, actually, is, which has more to do with the nature of friendships and how lasting partnerships can develop. And, yes, there's a bit to do with the paranormal, and a number of nods to classic films and TV shows are weaved into the material as well.
