Dick Grayson’s transformation into Nightwing and Beast Boy’s episode about saving the Titans were some of the best stuff I’ve watched in the superhero genre and Deathstroke is hands down one of the best live-action comic book villain adaptations out there although labeling him just a villain is a travesty. As things are revealed regarding the Titans’ past, you discover another dimension to Slade Wilson…one where he tries to protect his family in his own twisted way but one that also won’t take responsibility for his own sins as he places the blame on others, especially Dick Grayson.

LISBON -- At first glance, Dawn Happel appears to be your average, everyday housewife and mother.
   
 But the 1987 Mediapolis High School graduate is anything but average.
   
 Happel is the mother of nine children and the husband of Dean Happel, a three- time state wrestling champion who went on to wrestle at Iowa, which is where the couple met.
   
 Dawn Happel has homeschooled her children through various stages, not because they don't like or trust the public school system, but she wanted to watch her children grow.
   
 Dawn Happel got the experience of a lifetime and memories that will last just as long.
   
 And she did something along the way that only one other woman in Iowa history has done -- she raised a pair of four-time state wrestling champions.
   
 On Feb. 22, Cael Happel leaped up from the center mat at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, seconds after pinning Logan James of Underwood to win the Class 1A 138-pound state title, he thrust four both hands into the air, four fingers displayed signifying his fourth state championship.
   
 Happel not only became the 28th four-time state champion in state history, he joined his brother, Carter Happel, who was the 27th four-time state champion.
   
 And as Cael celebrated with his father, who is an assistant coach for Lisbon, Dawn Happel sat in the stands surrounded by family and friends, a flood of emotions hitting her like a tidal wave. The son she carried inside her body for nine months, nurtured and mothered to maturity, taught him his ABC and 1,2,3s, drove around to countless tournaments, played with, laughed with, cried with and spent nearly every single day of his life with, had achieved his goal.
   
 This was a special moment for Dawn Happel, who wasn't quite sure how to take it all in, yet wanted to savor every last second of the historic moment.
   
 "When you are sitting in the stands worrying about what might happen, those are hard times," Dawn Happel said. "I wanted to treasure watching Cael for the last time in high school, but at the same time I was so nervous I just wanted to get it over. I was so nervous for Cael. If he lost, people were going to be talking about it for a long time."
   
 Dawn Happel grew up new Mediapolis, a town known for great athletics, great athletes and great coaches. The Swafford family lived right down the road and rode the same bus to school and back every day.
   
 As a freshman, she played basketball for Hall of Fame coach Vernon "Bud" McLearn. Dawn (Derr) Happel became the first Mediapolis cross country runner to qualify for the state meet during her junior year. During her sophomore year, she decided to become a statistician for Hall of Fame wrestling coach Dan Cummings.
   
 Little did she know then how much wrestling would shape her world from that point forward.
   
 "I applied to be a mat maid at Iowa. We kept the books, ran the clock, helped at the table, all that stuff," Dawn Happel said. "I met my future husband, Dean, in the wrestling office one day. One of my friends was dating a wrestler and I told her to have him bring Dean one night. We hit it off just fine from the start."
   
 After graduating and getting married, Dawn and Dean Happel settled in Lisbon, Dean's hometown, where he works at Elite Stone Fabricating on Highway 30 and also coaches track and wrestling.
   
 Once the children started coming along, Dawn and Dean decided to homeschool.
   
 "Our oldest daughter was in fourth grade and Carter was in kindergarten when we decided to homeschool," Dawn Happel said. "For a while, I had all nine kids here at home with me. Once they got older, we decided to put them back in public school, mostly because Carter wanted to go to a four-year college and I didn't want to do the science labs and foreign language. So Carter went to school in the afternoons for those classes and I fill in the other classes."
   
 Carter started in wrestling, followed by Cael and Quincy. The family would travel most weekends to wrestling tournaments on the AAU circuit. Back in those days, Carter and Quincy usually found far more success on the mat than did Cael, which further drove Cael to keep working harder and harder.
   
 "I remember one tournament Quincy and Carter both won, and Cael got second. The next year Quincy and Carter won again and Cael got fourth. If someone told me back then that Cael would be a four-time state champion and Quincy wouldn't place his first two years, I would have told them they were crazy," Dawn Happel said. "I didn't think Cael would win four straight on the heels of Carter winning four straight. I think Quincy has struggled being in the shadow of both of them. We tell him, 'Just be the best you you can be.' But Quincy is a very good runner. That is kind of his thing and he is very good at it."
   
 Raising nine kids while also homeschooling them has kept Dawn Happel busy, from making meals to doing laundry to cleaning house to preparing and teaching lessons, she is busy most of the day. Yet she still finds time to get to her children's extra-curricular activities. After spending the previous weekend in Des Moines watching Cael and Quincy wrestle in the state tournament, Dawn Happel spent last weekend at a volleyball tournament. It's all par for the course for a busy mom.
   
 Danw Happel wouldn't trade a single second of any of it for any amount of money.
   
 "We've made so many good memories together," Dawn Happel said. "We will be sitting around talking and someone will say, 'Hey, do remember when we did this?' or, 'Hey, do you remember the time?' Those are precious memories that I will forever treasure."
   
 No matter what their kids did, Dawn and Dean Happel always treated them equally. Winning four state wrestling championships might make you a better wrestler than others, but not necessarily a better person. Character isn't judged in wins and losses, but rather how one reacts to them. And there was plenty of love to spread around equally, no matter the circumstances.
   
 "Carter and Cael are just two of nine," Dawn Happel said. "Honestly, they just blend in with the rest of the family. We did do anything different for them that we did for any of our other kids. They know that wrestling is for the wrestling room and meets. Home is home. We tell them a little tip that separates them -- good wrestlers are a dime a dozen, but good wrestlers with good grades are not."
   
 While Dawn and Dean now have a grandchild and Carter is busy wrestling at Iowa and Cael is preparing to head to Cedar Falls to wrestle for the University of Northern Iowa, there is still plenty of work to be done, plenty of memories to create and plenty of love to share.
   
 For Dawn Happel, it all started back in Mediapolis. Her father still lives in Mediapolis, although with all the activities of their nine children, she admits they don't get down to visit him as much as they would like.
   
 For Dawn Happel, he heart may be in Lisbon, but her roots are firmly planted in the life lessons learned growing up in a school that is well know for its academics and well as athletics.
   
 She would trade any of it for the world.
   
 "I love Mediapolis," Dawn Happel said. "I remember hanging out in the school parking lot on weekends and driving a loop around town. It seemed like all the kids with big trucks with the tires jacked up all lived in Mediapolis. Everyone just hung out and we had a good time. Those are some great memories, times I will never forget."

However, my preferred solution is to change the town to a fiscal budget that runs from July 1 through June 30. There are some hurdles and advantages to this but the thing that is pertinent here is that Town Meeting could be moved to May.

Now, Sanders said, “this has become a semi-big city. Fun to go all over the place. I love going to all sorts of places, places we own, places we don’t own. It’s become quite the vivacious downtown.”
 Denver, Aurora and other northern Colorado cities have seen multiple hotel projects over several years as their economies boomed, while the Springs waited for its share, said Doug Price, president and CEO of Visit Colorado Springs, the local convention and visitors bureau.
 Now, the Olympic and Paralympic Museum, multiuse stadium and indoor arena promise to be people-generating anchors that downtown developers have been waiting for and that are expected to help drive the demand for hotels, he said. “It’s now our time,” Price said.
 Overall tourism, he added, is on the rise. The latest annual study by industry consultant Longwoods International showed that 23 million people visited the Pikes Peak region in 2018 and spent $2.4 billion, 4.3% more than the year before.
 Downtown has been underserved for years, said Ted Jarosz, whose family partnership developed the 80-room Holiday Inn Express & Suites that opened in 2014 on Spruce Street, west of Interstate 25. “And that is why we are seeing this boom and it also doesn’t hurt that interest rates are low,” Jarosz said via email.
 Incentives also have helped.
 A 261-room hotel being built on South Tejon Street that will carry Marriott’s SpringHill Suites and Element brands, along with the Hyatt Place, are being built inside city-designated urban renewal districts.
 Future tax revenues generated by new development in those districts can be spent on roads, utilities and other improvements that benefit the public. The revenues set aside to pay for public projects help defray developer costs and encourage them to invest in areas that local governments deem blighted.
 In the case of the SpringHill Suites/Element hotel, urban renewal funds will help pay the cost of a 216-space underground parking garage, said Jim DiBiase, a commercial broker with Olive Real Estate Group who’s part of the hotel’s development team.
 Marriott wanted convenient and safe parking as a condition of allowing its brand to be attached to the project, he said. The garage, however, isn’t just for hotel guests; it also will be open to the public in a part of downtown where parking is scarce, DiBiase said.
 The SpringHill Suites/Element hotel, along with the 80-space Kinship Landing hotel under construction on South Nevada Avenue, also are part of federal opportunity zones — state-designated distressed areas that offer tax breaks to investors who fund projects inside the zones’ boundaries.
 Edmondson, of the Downtown Partnership, isn’t overly worried about overbuilding, since downtown went so long without new properties. And when the Clarion Inn and Quality Inn were closed in early 2019 in anticipation of the buildings being converted into housing, downtown lost about 150 guest rooms.

The Ojibwe and Dakota tribes of the region incorporated wild ponies into their lifestyles, using them for transportation and hunting, drastically improving their mobility. Horses helped the first Euro-American settlers establish themselves in the area; assisting in the logging industry that shaped so much of the St. Croix Valley’s history.
 To many locals, Washington County is unrivaled in its appreciation of horses.
 Jennifer Collman, the owner of Windfall Equestrian Center in Stillwater, said that the horse culture in Washington County is very different from where she grew up in Alaska.
 “In Alaska it’s very expensive to have horses,” Collman said. “So anybody that did it was either barely scraping by or just getting the minimum amount of education. Then I moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where on farms a horse is a working animal. The mindset was so different, but this is just a great place. There are a lot of good people that care about developing a good partnership with their horse and not necessarily how many ribbons they win.”
 The people of Washington County are not the types who send their horse off to a trainer because they don’t want to do the work, Collman said. Equestrians in this region put a lot of effort into developing their skills.
 “It’s a higher level of people who take horses really seriously,” Collman said. “To some people it’s a farm animal, you get on it, kick it around. That’s not the way I look at good horsemanship. It’s a partnership, and the person is putting an effort into making it work. I see a lot of that around here.”
 Collman is proud of her stable’s ability to bring together riders with so many different goals, and creating a community of camaraderie and support.
 “Usually barns specialize in one thing. Here, everybody does something different. Even if they compete in the same discipline or they both trail ride, maybe they both enjoy dressage, there’s not that feeling of superiority, because everybody here is on their own unique journey,” Collman said.
 In the Forest Lake area, Shadow Creek Stables has a long history of equestrian excellence. When owners Susan and Ron Moore purchased the property in 1979, it was already known as Shadow Creek Ranch.
 The stable has seen a lot of change over the years—in 2018, it was even considered a possible site for a youth recovery center which would give residents access to the healing that comes from working with horses.
 The idea didn’t pan out, but Shadow Creek has offered lessons to children and adults in the community for years. The stable specializes in English riding and hunter jumper lessons.

CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - State Reps. Juanita Brent (D-Cleveland) and Paula Hicks-Hudson (D-Toledo) introduced legislation, the “Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN) Act,” which would ban discriminatory policies in Ohio schools that penalize students, especially students of color, for wearing natural hairstyles that embrace their cultural identities.“We want our schools to be welcoming places that embrace diversity—not discriminate against it. And yet, we continue to hear of instances of discrimination against black and brown kids who wear their hair naturally," Rep. Brent said.Under the CROWN Act, Ohio schools would be prohibited from discriminating against anyone who wears a natural hairstyle or protective article that embraces their cultural identity. This would extend not only to class time, but to athletics and other school-related functions.“The CROWN Act is a good first step to help eliminate the unconscious biases that too often hold people of color back in Ohio,” said Rep. Hicks-Hudson. “We work for you—and that means taking on discrimination whenever it happens, especially in our schools. At the end of the day, the way you wear your hair should not limit your pursuit of the American Dream.”In October, Cincinnati became the second city in the country (NYC is the other) to pass a law making hair discrimination illegal. California and New York also state recently passed bans.Under the bill, those who allege discrimination would be able to file a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) previously unveiled a bill that would ban discrimination based on hair textures and hairstyles that are commonly associated with a particular race or national origin.Congresswoman Marcia Fudge (D-OH) is supporting the CROWN Act (hair anti-discrimination bill) that was introduced by Senator Cory Booker.Although existing federal law prohibits some forms of hair discrimination as a type of racial or national origin discrimination, some federal courts have narrowly construed those protections in a way that permits schools, workplaces, and federally funded institutions to discriminate against people of African descent who wear certain types of natural or protective hairstyles.“It is disheartening that, in 2019, hair discrimination creates additional barriers for people of color in education and places of employment,” Rep. Fudge said. “Traditional hairstyles worn by African Americans are often necessary to meet our unique needs, and are a representation of our culture and ethnicity.“Every day, Black women and men are forced to consider if their natural hair is “appropriate” or “professional” by Eurocentric standards,” Rep. Barbara Lee said. “With the introduction of the CROWN Act of 2019, introduced by Cory Booker, we are making it clear that discrimination against Black women and men who wear their natural hairstyles is wrong and must be prohibited.Copyright 2020 WOIO.

When it came time to say “I do” or “I don’t,” she opted not to tie the knot with her then-fiancé. The couple left the show separately, with Mark assuring both his mom and everyone at home that he’d be fine. Our social media sleuthing tells us that chances are slim to none that they reunited after filming. It seems Jessica has moved to California, while her ex is still calling Georgia home.

The University has also made progress in shifting its central heating plant to run off of “sustainable electricity.” There are two near-term plans currently in consideration to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before the conversion to sustainable electricity: burning recycled biofuel instead of natural gas and offsetting natural gas usage through investment in a renewable natural gas project, according to the letter. The central heating plant heats 70 of the buildings on campus while the other 140 are heated separately, said Vice President for Facilities Management Michael Guglielmo, Jr.

In light of the totally inadequate response from the Trump administration concerning the worldwide spread of the virulent and deadly coronavirus, and what’s being said by Limbaugh and other very right-leaning conservatives, I must add my "two cents." I am no longer able to ignore Limbaugh's daily vitriolic venom. I am no longer able to accept that Mr. Trump gave Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom*, an honor which is reserved for those human beings who have contributed much, sacrificed much, and changed the mindset of governments worldwide. Those other Presidential Medal of Freedom honorees have been our conscience. They have been our guiding light. Those other altruistic people have done so very much to change and add to the quality of life for millions. Those other honorees have made a great difference in how the world deals with and encourages living in peace and harmony with one another. Those honorees have put their own suffering and persecution aside to continue their mission. Those other honorees have been imprisoned for speaking and standing up to injustice.
 Those people have brought us to a place where it does not matter about your religious beliefs or lack thereof, the color of your skin, or who you choose to love and marry. What mattered to these honorees was providing medical care and medications to the poor, doing away with segregation/apartheid, providing food to the starving, wiping out disease, or caring for the neglected and ignored who walk among us.
