April 2017 saw the reserved matters application for the seafront redevelopment approved. It meant the council could now go ahead and build the £18million redevelopment of a 3.6-hectare swathe of Queen's Drive, but had no plans to do so. Had the application been rejected, it would have meant the outline permission for redevelopment would have no longer been extant and sent the project back to the drawing board.

In the long run, bringing wages into line with housing costs is the only sustainable, market-based solution to our affordable housing shortage. Until that happens, we will continue to have daily crises in hundreds of households. When housing costs are too high, families can face eviction because of minor financial events that many families take in stride. The Princeton University- based Eviction Lab analyzed evictions across the country. Davenport ranked 44th highest in the country — with a reported 770 evictions in 2016, two evictions occurring every day in the city.
 The same study ranked Cedar Rapids 89th and Des Moines 91st.

This discernment process can be emotional, complicated and even painful. Thus, the bishops encouraged priests to “consult with parents, those who take the place of parents, diocesan personnel involved with disability issues, psychologists, religious educators and other experts in making their judgment. If it is determined that a parishioner who is disabled is not ready to receive the sacrament, great care is to be taken in explaining the reasons for this decision. Cases of doubt should be resolved in favor of the right of the Catholic to receive the sacrament.”
 This is a topic close to Schneider’s heart, since he was diagnosed as autistic two years after his ordination to the priesthood in 2013. He has paid close attention to how Catholic clergy and educators minister to people all along the autism spectrum, while personally wrestling with what used to be called Asperger’s syndrome.
 “Some autistics — who don’t adapt to this neurotypical world too well — really can’t go through the normal sacramental preparation class,” he wrote in an online commentary on this topic. “It’s just not going to work. I went through all the pretty much normal ones as a kid, but I can see a lot of other autistics really struggling with that.”
 Under normal circumstances, children receive First Communion after completing an education process that leads to the confession of sins, in what is now called the Sacrament of Reconciliation. However, children with disabilities may struggle with this process or find it impossible, depending on their ability to communicate.
 Schneider stressed that this is when parents and pastors should seek help from specialists at their local diocese, or a nearby archdiocese, who can help them find the proper materials and teaching methods for each special-needs child. For example, there are now flipbooks and picture-card sets that — without words — explain the symbols and rituals in a Mass.
 One “Communion Is Not the Same as Food” puzzle set uses simple images to help children distinguish between the Eucharist and “home food.”
 “Sometimes ordinary human communications can simply break down,” said Schneider. “Pastors and parents have to find a way to stay on the same page while handling these sensitive issues.”
