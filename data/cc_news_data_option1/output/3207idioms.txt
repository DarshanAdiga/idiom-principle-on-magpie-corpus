Health authorities in Australia have been heavily criticised in an official inquiry into the Ruby Princess cruise ship coronavirus outbreak.
 The inquiry found "serious errors" by New South Wales Health in its handling of suspected cases on board.
 All 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark in Sydney in March without sufficient screening. More than 100 of them felt unwell.
 A total of 914 later tested positive. Twenty-two died.
 The ship, carrying mostly Australian passengers, had completed an 11-day cruise from Sydney to New Zealand and back when it docked on 19 March.

"People think that going to Europe is about having a lavish lifestyle, big house, good car- its not that. You start from scratch. You have to prove that you are good enough to be on the bench, then get a chance in the starting 11. You should start from smaller clubs of smaller leagues in Europe. You have to be very talented, you have to be mentally strong and be there and work. I’m afraid that many can’t do this. It entails lots of sacrifices. If they can do it, why not us?

In realtà, facciamo scorrere le nostre vite, fingendo di non vedere. Probabilmente è una sorta di scudo, che in modo automatico, alziamo per difenderci da un problema che spesso non conosciamo e dunque proviamo a rifuggire, da quella che è una responsabilità sociale che accomuna tutti, se interpretiamo il significato di comunità, nella pienezza della sua essenza. Dunque fingiamo di non vedere, un problema sociale grave che affligge le nostre comunità. Parliamo dell’uso ed abuso di droghe e di alcol. Probabilmente ci auto convinciamo che il problema è di altri; spesso è così. In realtà però, provate ad immaginare un corpo umano dove si manifesta un’infezione che, se degenera, può andare in cancrena e colpire anche altre parti del corpo. A quel punto il problema non è solo di quell’organo malato; insomma il rischio è per l’intero corpo. Il rischio è la vita stessa. Se mai può essere calzante questa metafora, allora è chiaro che il problema delle dipendenze in una comunità, l’esistenza stessa di persone, concittadini, che fanno uso ed abuso di droghe, di cocaina, di alcol, è un problema della collettività. Lo è perché l’età media delle prime assunzioni, specialmente quelle di alcol, si va abbassando e per gli adolescenti costituisce un rischio serio. Lo è perché il fatto stesso di poter trovare nella facile disponibilità, sostanze stupefacenti, a pochi passi, aumenta a dismisura il pericolo del diffondersi di comportamenti che sono pericolosi per i giovani che facilmente emulano atteggiamenti comuni. Di pari passo il discorso sul consumo di alcol, troppo spesso tollerato come abitudini. Si pone dunque la questione della responsabilità civile che passa attraverso l’interessamento di tutti su ciò che accade, non per mero pettegolezzo, ma per responsabilità sociale. Alzare la testa, aprire gli occhi e non negare ciò che accade intorno a noi. Non ci vuole molto per cogliere i segnali, spesso evidenti, di come, chi e quando, fa uso ed abuso di droghe e di alcol. E si badi bene, non è un problema di rispetto della privacy, perché se mai così fosse, allora la questione sarebbe ristretta all’intimità di un problema, perché le dipendenze sono un problema, che andrebbe affrontato solo dal punto di vista medico e sanitario. Lo è in parte per l’uso e l’abuso di alcol; non può esserlo per l’uso di droghe. Non lo è perché le droghe sono fenomeno di aggregazione sociale che spinge coloro che ne dispongono non solo all’uso personale, ma con la necessità di fare mercato, quindi alla diffusione, o spaccio; dunque il fenomeno diviene così criminale. Tutti sanno, nessuno dice. Il consumo di cocaina è diffusissimo. Persone apparentemente insospettabili che si celano dietro una vita dai contorni “normali” sono consumatori abituali di cocaina e tra i più giovani purtroppo anche l’uso di droghe sintetiche. Attenzione, non è più questione della cosiddetta “canna” che, inutile negarlo, è stata nel passato parte integrante del passaggio di gioventù tra gli eccessi. Qualche anno fa questo fenomeno che certamente esisteva ed ha interessato più o meno tutta la gioventù di allora, era certamente circoscritto all’episodio o al periodo. Finiva tutto li, con l’arrivo delle responsabilità e della maturità che segue i vent’’anni. I fenomeni attuali sono purtroppo di natura molto più grave e preoccupante. La stessa assunzione di eroina, erroneamente considerata finita negli anni ‘90, perché non più visibile per strada, in realtà non si è mai del tutto esaurita. Certamente, essa è diminuita. Nella Relazione annuale al Parlamento sullo stato delle tossicodipendenze in Italia ci dicono che da circa dieci anni si registra una tendenza crescente, seppure non di numeri enormi, in termini assoluti. Lo dimostrano anche le inchieste giudiziarie. Se calano i sequestri di marijuana ed hashish, aumentano nettamente quelli di cocaina: dal 2018 al 2019 +127,2%. “I decrementi riguardano quasi tutte le sostanze, con eccezione della cocaina e delle droghe sintetiche – si legge nella relazione -. Spiccano, in particolare, gli scostamenti negativi riferibili ai derivati della cannabis, tanto per quanto riguarda l’hashish (-73,25%), che per la marijuana (-39,83%) e la presentazione in piante (-57%). Quanto agli scostamenti positivi, un vistoso aumento si registra per la cocaina che, in termini assoluti, quasi triplica i volumi caduti in sequestro rispetto al 2018 (+127,2%), raggiungendo la quota record di 8,4 tonnellate sottratte al mercato illegale“. Eccolo dunque il problema dell’oggi. L’uso ed abuso di cocaina, anche nelle piccole comunità. Per sconfiggere questo male non può bastare l’intervento delle forze di polizia. Per battere questo nemico che si è già insediato nelle nostre comunità occorre trovare la forza ed il coraggio di alzare la testa e di indicare, parlare, se necessario denunciare. E’ una battaglia questa necessaria per salvare vite umane, per salvare famiglie, attività commerciali. Una battaglia per restituire una società, una comunità diversa, sicura, ai nostri figli.

Provisional A Level results show that more than half of all entries at Islington’s secondary schools and academies with sixth forms were awarded grades A*-B - which is better than this year’s national average.
 Cllr Kaya Comer-Schwartz, Islington’s executive member for children young people and families, congratulated all the pupils who received their BTEC, AS and A Level results yesterday.
 “The coronavirus pandemic has made it a difficult year for pupils up and down the country, but especially for those completing their courses and expecting to sit final exams this summer,” she said.
 “I’m exceptionally proud of every single young person who has continued to work so hard through the uncertainty of the last few months, which are unprecedented in modern times.
 “Getting to this point is a real achievement – not just for our young people but also for our teachers and staff working behind the scenes, who have risen to the many challenges of the last few months.”
 Instead of sitting exams this year, the coronavirus pandemic has meant that exam boards calculated students’ grades nationally based on factors including teachers’ predictions, mock exam results and the attainment of their peers in previous years.
 The Department for Education intends to apply a ‘triple-lock’ for A-level grades, and has said that if students are unhappy with their A or AS level grade, they will have the opportunity to sit an exam in the autumn, or to use the results of mock exams that a school might have set before lockdown through the appeal process.
 But the final details are still being worked on.
 Cllr Comer-Schwartz said: “Despite the heroic efforts of Islington’s children, some will be bitterly disappointed with their results today and have been hard done by,” she said.
 “It is vital that the Government urgently looks at a genuine appeals process, open to all students to appeal their results on any basis, as well as put a support plan in place for those doing retakes in the autumn.”

Konuyu, '90DakikamaDokunma' etiketiyle sosyal medyaya da taşıyan İzmirliler, duruma tepki gösterdi.İzmir Büyükşehir Belediyesi tarafından, Plan Bütçe ve Tüketici Komisyonu'na verilen önergede, 90 dakika boyunca yapılan aktarmalı binişlerin ücretsiz olmasını kapsayan ve '90 Dakika' olarak bilinen uygulamanın kaldırılması, bunun yerine ikinci ve üçüncü binişlerden 50'şer kuruşluk ücret alınması öngörüldü. Bunun üzerine sosyal medyada örgütlenen İzmirliler, '90DakikamaDokunma' etiketiyle konuyu gündeme taşıdı.Duruma tepki gösteren vatandaşlardan Demet İyikanat, 'Milyonlarca insan işe gidip geliyor.

The passengers - some seen coughing and spluttering - were allowed to leave the ship at Sydney Harbour, catching trains, buses and even overseas flights to get home.
 But despite officials' fears, the virus did not spread far beyond those who had been on board.
 Excluding a cluster in the island state of Tasmania which spread through a hospital, only 34 people in Australia caught the virus through secondary transmission.
 But it was Australia's worst coronavirus episode before the current lockdown in Victoria.
 ## What are the findings?
 The Commission of Inquiry said all passengers with "acute respiratory illness" or "influenza-like illness" should have been tested for Covid-19, in line with new guidelines issued on 10 March.
 "NSW Health should have ensured that cruise ships were aware of the change to the definition of a 'suspect case' for Covid-19 made on 10 March," its report says.
 "This would have resulted in the identification of such cases on the Ruby Princess. 101 persons fell within the suspect case definition by 18 March, and 120 by the time the ship docked."

“There are a lot of people out and about, whether it’s working or going to the grocery or doing your lives, and they’re doing it safely. And we can vote safely in person as well,” he said during his weekly COVID-19 briefing Aug. 5.
 There is a lot that could change in the three months before the election, but America has struggled to limit the spread of the new coronavirus, and voting rights advocates fear Hoosiers will be forced to sacrifice their health — and the health of anyone they interact with — to cast a ballot.
 “Nobody should have to risk their health to exercise their right to vote, but that is the position Indiana officials are putting Hoosiers in right now,” said Julia Vaughn, policy director for Common Cause Indiana, a nonpartisan group that promotes government transparency.
 The State Conference of the NAACP and Common Cause Indiana have filed a federal lawsuit that claims the state’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots — noon on Election Day — doesn’t account for potential mail delays or a possible surge in mail-in ballots.
 Holcomb has said he’s waiting on that lawsuit, plus another lawsuit about polling centers staying open past 6 p.m., to be resolved before making any possible changes to the November election.
 Just over half of everyone who voted in Indiana for the primary did so with an absentee ballot, including 67% of Marion County voters. Expanded voting options probably helped lead to a turnout that was 4 percentage points higher than it was in the 2018 primary statewide.
 Primary voters did not have to give a reason for why they wanted to vote absentee, which is something other states have adopted for the general election. Indiana voters usually have to choose from a list of 11 reasons they can’t vote in person, such as being out of the county for 12 hours on Election Day or not having transportation.
 Apply for an absentee ballot by completing an application online.
 The deadline to apply for an absentee ballot is Oct. 22.

How do we level the proverbial playing field? There are at least four steps that this nation must take. First, white Americans (government officials and the electorate) must agree that reparations are necessary for Black people to thrive. Period. Reparations do not, necessarily, need to be in the form of a large check written to African Americans. (But I would not, necessarily, rule out that possibility.)
 Second, lawmakers must strongly enforce laws against racial and gender discrimination in employment, and racial discrimination in housing. Third, we must stop funding public schools via property taxes, which virtually ensures unequal educational opportunities for most children of color.
 Fourth, we must eradicate the school-to-prison pipeline and end for-profit prisons. For-profit businesses need customers to survive. Black men and women are disproportionately the “customers” of such prisons. The nexus between race, gender and class as regards Black folks means that righting these historic racial wrongs will mitigate the racial wealth gap — which ultimately is more important than the wage gap.
 I genuinely empathize with the fact that millions of white Americans struggle financially. Saving this nation requires that they come to understand that the above steps are ultimately in their best interests. The erstwhile “American Dream” to which they aspired has become the American Myth. That’s because white America’s intra-racial wealth gap is at an all-time high. And growing. (For us it has always been the American Nightmare.)
 As legendary Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall observed, “No one benefits from racism” — at least in the long run. The marathon for racial justice in America is an exhausting and maddening race, but this nation’s survival demands that we endure it until the end.

“The things is, you still have to wear a mask, so you can’t see people’s face,” she said. “You’re trying to develop a relationship and all you see is people’s eyes, so it can be challenging. I’m intentional about getting out and about, though.”
 Along with Evans, Jenkins-Agurs gets to know the IndyGo teammates over lunch. Dishing out meals to workers and letting them know they’re valued, Jenkins- Agurs said, is an important step into making everyone feel like they are a part of the family.
 “I read a quote that diversity is being asked to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance,” Jenkins-Agurs said. “Here at IndyGo, we want to make sure that every teammate feels included, regardless of their religion, background or who they choose to love. We want to support them and let them know that they can grow here at IndyGo.”
 While Jenkins-Agurs was happy to get out of the health care system in Florida — a hotspot for COVID-19 and a generally stressful environment, she said — it’s not just a new step for her. According to Evans, this new position is a step forward for the future of IndyGo.
 “This is a critical role for our agency as we move our workforce and agency into the next chapter,” Evans said in a statement. “Denise’s experience and knowledge will be vitally important to our efforts to strengthen our employee management, diversity and inclusion initiatives.”
 Jenkins-Agurs knows there may be some challenges on the road ahead — such as learning the meaning of all the acronyms used in the transportation industry — however, she’s excited to dive head first into what she calls her dream job.
 “My purpose in life is to help people as it relates to education,” Jenkins- Agurs said. “I’m passionate about people and service, and when you understand your purpose, you’ll never work another day in your life, because it’s what you’re called to do. … I’m blessed to have this opportunity.”

Geelani was born in the Bandipora area of northern Kashmir on September 29, 1929. A staunch advocate of Kashmiris' right to self-determination, he has been the leading voice against Indian oppression and injustice in the occupied valley.  
 The Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella organisation formed in 1993 by various pro-freedom groups in Kashmir, provides a political platform for voices that wish to rid the area of Indian occupation.
 However, there was a split in the group in 2003 with Geelani leading a separate faction that was in favour of accession to Pakistan. The split formed when Geelani walked out after another group decided to hold talks with New Delhi.
 Geelani was elected chairman for life of his Hurriyat group, which comprises 24 constituent parties.  
 The other faction is led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who has been under house arrest since August last year. Both Hurriyats used to regularly issue statements and protest programmes against the Indian leadership.
 ## Kashmir Solidarity Day
 Pakistan is celebrating Independence Day today. In his message, President Alvi stated that the country was observing it as the "Kashmir Solidarity Day" in light of India's illegal attempt at the annexation of the occupied territory.  
 On his Independence Day message, President Alvi reassured Pakistanis that the people of occupied Kashmir will get their right to self-determination.
 "I assure the resilient people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir that Pakistan will continue to support them in their just struggle for their Right to Self-Determination as enshrined in the United Nations Security Council resolutions," he said.
 Public and private buildings as well as streets bazaars and markets have been profusely illuminated. National flags, buntings, portraits of founding fathers, posters and banners are also seen everywhere as part of the celebration of Independence Day.
 "We need to stand united to meet the social, economic and security challenges being confronted by the nation,” the president said.
 Prime Minister Imran Khan in his message also congratulated the entire nation on 74th Independence Day.
 “During past seven decades of our journey, we have confronted with various challenges. We have battled against odds both at external as well as internal fronts. From the hostility of a neighboring country, with its known hegemonic intentions, to the scourge of terrorism and from coping with natural calamities to fighting pandemics, our nation has always shown resilience and perseverance,” said PM Imran.
 “While we celebrate this Independence Day, our hearts are profoundly grieved by the sufferings of our brethren in Indian occupied Kashmir who are facing military siege since past one year. We stand firmly behind our Kashmiri brethren in their struggle for their right to self-determination,” said PM Imran.

In this role, Jenkins-Agurs will help IndyGo employees — or “teammates” — find educational and workforce development opportunities to develop their skills and enhance their careers.
 With 25 years of workforce development experience under her belt, Jenkins- Agurs said working for someone like IndyGo CEO Inez Evans made her transition easy, and she’s excited for what lies ahead.
 “It has been an excellent ride to be able to report to someone who gets it,” Jenkins-Agurs said of Evans. “She understands the importance of the people on the front line … and she puts people first, and that makes it easier to develop new initiatives.”
 A few of the initiatives Jenkins-Agurs has in the works is a partnership with Providence Cristo Rey for internship opportunities for students, as well as an apprenticeship program for IndyGo’s maintenance workers and operators.
 “My biggest goal here is to make sure we have a robust learning program to make sure that every employee who decides to work here understands that where they start doesn’t mean that’s where they end,” Jenkins-Agurs said. “I want to make sure we have the educational components to meet the needs of our teammates … and a solid program that fits the needs of everyone.”
 Like Evans, who began her role as CEO in August of 2019, Jenkins-Agurs spends her days getting a firsthand look at IndyGo operations and meeting workers and riders. However, due to COVID-19, things look a lot different.

 Marion County mailed all registered voters an absentee ballot application before the June primary, but that proved to be a slow process with delays, and many voters worried their ballot didn’t make it back to the election board in time to be counted.
 Marion County Clerk Myla Eldridge told Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson in a letter in late May that she feared “thousands” of ballots would go uncounted.
 The office received more than 123,000 absentee ballot applications before the deadline, which is 20 times more than for the 2016 primary.
 Other counties in Indiana may be able to implement a large-scale vote-by-mail campaign with short notice, but Marion County needs more time.
 Hollis said the office doesn’t have a deadline in mind and is instead focused on voter education.
 “We’re moving forward with the way things are today,” he said. “We are planning to be flexible enough to where if things change, we could accommodate those changes.”
 If Indiana doesn’t adopt no-excuse absentee voting, and if the situation with COVID-19 doesn’t improve drastically, that would cause some worry about lower voter turnout in an election year that includes the presidency.
 Chrystal Ratcliffe, president of the local NAACP chapter, isn’t worried about lower turnout for African Americans, though, who she said will turn out “no matter what.”
 “At the end of the day, it suppresses the vote,” she said of not expanding mail-in voting. “That’s what they’re doing. Our mission is to still get those voters out.”

Clouds will stick around overnight into Monday morning. We'll have a couple of showers around perhaps before lunchtime but I also believe we'll have a few breaks of sun. This is all out ahead of a cold front, which looks to move through later in the day. It'll bring more scattered showers with it as we get later into the afternoon, perhaps a rumble of thunder. Highs will be a few degrees higher than Sunday, in the 70s with a few low 80s around.

Some parts of the economy are undoubtedly showing great resilience but there are going to be bumpy months ahead and a long, long way to go."

"I think it (the stint with Stabaek) made me a better player by leaps and bounds. It fortified my mentality and made me independent. The exposure makes you tougher, a person who can deal with every kind of situation. Nowadays, young players don’t get tough situations. (In Europe) you will be in an isolated place where there's no other Indian in the league. The language, the food, everything is different. It helped me gain that mental strength.
