Beloved Wife & Mother Age 69 of West St. Paul, MN Born September 1, 1950 in Granite Falls, Minnesota. Passed away peacefully on June 23, 2020 with loving husband and daughter by her side. Married for 45 years to Richard D. Clark. Longtime resident of South St. Paul. In 1978, she and Rick finalized adoption of their daughter, Maria Sumitra, from Bhagalpur, India. From becoming a VISTA volunteer in 1973 (where she met her husband), to Dakota County Child Protective Services, to serving in youth ministry at Luther Memorial Church, to being an active member of Augustana Lutheran Church, to being a SSP Band Backer, to serving on the South St. Paul Board of Education for 3 terms, to 917 School Board, and Good Samaritan Nursing Home Board, to campaigning tirelessly for many DFL candidates, Debbie showed up for people and causes she believed in. Debbie showed up to ball games, hockey games, art shows, baptisms, first communions, confirmations, band competitions, drumline shows, plays, campaign rallies, protests, fundraisers, auctions, choir concerts, band concerts, visitations, funeral services, weddings, showers, graduation ceremonies, for her daughter, for her siblings, for nieces, nephews, godsons, goddaughters, cousins, cousins' kids, friends, friends' kids. She sent cards and letters and gifts to everyone, all the time. She remembered birthdays, holidays, and believed in celebrations large and small. She showed up by taking in strangers, friends, and family with little to no notice because they needed an empathetic ear, a compassionate hug, and a place to sleep. She learned to show up on social media, when she couldn't show up in person. She had a close circle of friends as a member of Bemidji State Card Club for nearly 50 years. Preceded in death by her parents, Mae and Doug Matthews, her stepfather, Fred Dahl, and her in-laws, Bonnie and Merlin Clark. She is survived by her loving husband, Rick, her daughter Maria (partner Shawn Sempel), siblings Kent (Paula) Matthews, Cheryl Matthews, Scott (Tracie) Matthews, sister-in-law Patti Matthews, numerous nieces, nephews, godchildren, loved ones, and friends. A private family interment of her remains is planned. Memorial services to be determined at a future date. Memorial contributions suggested to the South St. Paul Educational Foundation.

HOLLAND -- Dozens of shoppers turned out to browse the shelves at Jean Marie's new downtown Holland location on Thursday, June 25.
   
 "It's been so much fun," said general manager Marcie Kooyers. "We've had great traffic. You can definitely tell people want to be out and about. It's been awesome to see familiar faces, but we can also tell there's some tourists coming to Holland."
   
 The storefront -- located in the historic clock tower that once held Home & Co. on the corner of River Avenue and Eighth Street -- is owned by Jennifer and Matt Holmes.
   
 "We love being a part of the vibrant community that downtown Holland is," Matt told The Sentinel in November. "And the numerous relationships we have formed."
   
 The Holmes' successfully opened Home & Co. in 2005. They went on to establish Tip Toes and Jean Marie's, both of which have received "Best of the Best" awards through The Sentinel for their respective categories. In 2017, the couple sold Tip Toes to narrow their focus on Home & Co. and Jean Marie's.
   
 "We quickly found life to be a bit simpler and our ability to maintain excellent customer service standards easier," Matt said. "Now, after many years of running multiple retail concepts, we are ready and excited to narrow our focus on just one with Jean Marie's."
   
 But the downtown Jean Marie's location still carries the best brands of Home & Co. -- including YETI, Corkcicle and Nora Fleming.
   
 "We're almost calling it Jean Marie's Plus," Kooyers said. "If you come to this location, you're going to find a variety of gift items and wedding items. When the holidays roll around, we'll carry some great presents. And we still offer our free gift wrap. It's a great balance of fashion and items for your home, entertaining and gifting."
   
 Kooyers also wants customers to know Jean Marie's isn't taking COVID-19 lightly.
   
 "We have an updated website with a huge selection for those who want to shop online," she said. "But if you come here, our staff is cleaning consistently throughout the day, we're wearing masks and our priority is your safety. We want you to be able to come back and enjoy shopping in-person."

The Chromebook 3 is an 11.6″ traditional clamshell that will fold flat to 180 degrees and is powered by the Gemini Lake-R N4020 CPU, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The screen isn't great but it's better than a lot of 11.6″ Chromebooks that we've reviewed. It's all plastic and that's apparent when you pick it up. However, it doesn't feel cheap or slapped together. As a matter of fact, it carries itself more like a rugged device designed for the wear and tear of a classroom. If you are on a shoestring budget or just want something cheap but viable for around the house, this is my one and only pick at the sub-$200 price point. You can grab the 32GB Lenovo Chromebook 3 exclusively at Walmart.
