Polls — and the media — show partisan lines hardening as the pandemic stretches on. Fox's Tucker Carlson called Dr. Anthony Fauci a “buffoon" Tuesday. All three of the network's prime-time hosts — Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham — led their broadcasts with the “unmasking” story Wednesday.
 Hannity called it “the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in American history.” Repeatedly on Thursday, Fox tied presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden to the story.
 “Unmasking” of people in surveillance reports is considered a routine, and legal activity in government — the Trump administration made 10,012 such requests in 2019. But they don't often become public and, in the Flynn case, Trump supporters point to it as evidence that Obama loyalists were out to undermine Trump from the start.
 Midday on Thursday, websites for The New York Times and The Washington Post led with stories on the Bright testimony. There was no “unmasking” story on the Times' website, while the Post had an analysis headlined, “What is ‘Obamagate’ anyway? And how does it involve Michael Flynn?'”
 The website for the conservative One America News Network didn't mention Bright shortly after his testimony ended. The Hot Air blog had four stories about Flynn among the top 20 stories on its site, and none on Bright.
 The Drudge Report, which has notably turned on Trump in recent months, had a picture of Bright adjusting his face mask under the headline, “Whistleblower of Doom.”

“The ability to get in and use the facilities, once the individual states have cleared that and opening protocols … I’m all for it,” Addazio said during a conference call Thursday. “I have nothing against local gyms. I think they’re great. In the same breath, I’d like our kids to be in our gym. I know what the protocols are for cleanliness, and how many people can be in one place at one time … and I’d feel much greater about that. I’m excited for that. I think that’s the right thing to do.”

CHATHAM COUNTY, Ga. (WTOC) - New charges have been filed in the case of a New Year’s Eve assault. Bruce Helmly died as a result of the incident which has now been ruled a homicide.Helmly is remembered by his loved ones as a larger than life hero.“He was just a fun guy everybody loved him,” Bruce’s daughter Jessica Richard said.His daughter said the past five months have been difficult. Helmly was at Basil’s on Wilmington Island when police say he was punched. Helmly refused medical care but the next day lost consciousness and later died. An autopsy revealed he died of a subdural hematoma due to the assault. Police had already arrested Charles Alexander Jacobson Teeple, IV, but now he is charged with murder, aggravated assault and elder abuse.“You have to look at the evidence based on the totality of the circumstances and through the evidence gathering, and again and only after consulting with our partners in the DA’s office, we come to the conclusion that the best charge at this time are the three charges that were filed yesterday,” Chatham County Police Department Capt. Gene Harley said.Richard said the news of these new charges brought some relief in their grief.“The fact that something is going to be done about it has definitely brought a little bit more peace rather than this just feeling in your stomach like are they going to do anything about it. Is it just, are they going to get away with it? Did he die in vain? I mean all these,” Richard said.She said they are frustrated with how COVID-19 has impacted the case but are hopeful for justice.Chatham County Police say they have been in contact with Teeple’s attorney and he’s expected to turn himself in.Copyright 2020 WTOC.

Grinnell is home to Grinnell College, which adds to the comfortable and inviting feel of this city of just over 9,000 residents. It is a place where visitors can walk the streets, shop, eat and enjoy the friendly, laid-back atmosphere.      Grinnell is known as the Jewel of the Prairie, as it is loaded with some of Iowa's best independent restaurants and unique shops. It has been named as one of the Top Ten Coolest Small Towns in America by travel journalists.      History   A visit must include spending some time admiring the Merchants' National Bank building, one of the eight Midwestern "jewel box" banks designed by Louis Sullivan, an architecture legend and mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright.      The jewel box banks are made of brick. For the Grinnell bank, Sullivan chose a variety of brick colors, giving the 1914 building a reddish-brown appearance. The building has a jewel box or strongbox look with an ornamental interior and cathedral-like exterior.      The building is open to the public. It is currently the Grinnell Area Chamber of Commerce and visitors center. It is open year-round Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call ahead for a weekend visit. Docents are often available to answer questions. For more information call 641-236-6555.      Art   Grinnell thrives in arts and culture. The Grinnell College Museum of Art, formerly known as the Faulconer Gallery, is in the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts and is worth a stop. The museum offers major exhibits from international and national artists. The museum encompasses a print and drawing study room that offers students and faculty a place to see original works on paper from the museum's collection, including some by Pablo Picasso and Rembrandt van Rijn. The museum has more than 6,000 items.      It is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday except for major holidays, but is currently closed due to the pandemic.

The museum is also offering virtual tours and information from the artists at grinnell.edu/campus-life/arts-culture/museum.      Unique stay   There were probably times, as a student, you might have fallen asleep in class, but this unique, fun hotel offers visitors a chance to sleep in a classroom and not get in trouble.      Hotel Grinnell is a 1921 former junior high building with a variety of modern hotel rooms. Although the rooms are modern, they are also retro, and the design incorporates school items such as benches and the original hardwood floors. Rooms, in general, are half classroom and proved to be quiet and peaceful.      The hotel uses a bit of humor. An example is the necktie visitors hang on the door to not be disturbed. Rooms are not all the same as the former locker rooms are now bunk rooms. Each room also has a chalkboard. One of guests' favorite amenities are the complimentary bikes to get around town.      Different artwork is displayed in each room. The halls have been kept looking like a school, yet with a comfortable setting of a modern hotel.      The Periodic Table bar takes on a gymnasium look with an operating scoreboard on the wall. Owner-Operator Angela Harrington said the bar specializes in craft cocktails and mocktails. They have suspended food service at this time to encourage guests to dine around town.      The hotel is currently open with touchless check-in and has suspended daily cleaning services to minimize the exposure to others of each room.

Peaceful Nelson, Nevada, offers visitors a step back in time to the vibrant mining days of Nevada, the Silver State, an escape from daily life.   This ghost town is off the beaten path, and while standing among its historic buildings one would not think they were just a 45-minute drive from the bright lights of Las Vegas. Those traveling from Vegas on Route 95 will also pass Eldorado Canyon and "the monument," Nevada Historical Marker 9.      After an enjoyable ride through the valley travelers will come upon several original buildings from the 1700s. Originally, Nelson was called Eldorado, named by the Spaniards. They were the first to find gold in the mountains. About 100 years later the miners and prospectors developed the Techatticup Mine, which stands today in Nelson. The mine has a clouded reputation of killings that resulted from labor and management disputes. However, in 1861 the mine was considered to be the most important in the canyon as it produced millions of dollars of gold ore. The mine, a short distance from the Colorado River, was served by steamboats. The name Techatticup came from two Paiute words meaning "hungry" and "bread."      This now ghost of a town produced millions of dollars of copper, silver and gold until the mine closed in 1945.      Today mine tours are offered by stopping at the General Store in Nelson to sign up for the Eldorado Canyon Mine Tours. The buildings offer a historic tour of collectables from the area. Canoe and kayak rentals are available for those wanting to take an adventure on the beautiful Colorado River.      Inside the General Store is a small museum with pictures and information on the filming that takes place at Nelson, along with memorabilia and historic information. All ages will enjoy exploring the museum and walking around outside finding old cars, trucks and airplanes. The planes were used as props for the movie "3,000 Miles to Graceland." This ghost town is a popular area for use in movie backdrops, photo shoots and music videos. The National Geographic Channel's "Brain Games" was filmed in Nelson, as were the movies "Eye of the Beholder" and "Breakdown."      Do not get your hopes up when you travel downhill and see the Texaco sign standing tall among the historic buildings of Nelson. It is also historic. There is not a gas station or place to eat here. However, the General Store offers snacks and drinks. Fill your tank before setting out to visit Nelson.      Once you have completed the exploration of Nelson, continue to the end of the road where a spectacular view of the Colorado River awaits. Pack a picnic and find a rock, bring chairs, or sit in the car and enjoy what nature has to offer. Visitors can walk down to the river from this area.      Coming back uphill from the river, continue past the general store and on the left will be a few houses and a dirt road, Main Street. Turn left and follow it for a desert drive. If it is raining or has recently rained, better go back the way you came. If you are short on gas or time, do not do it! However, if you do continue, it is a climb to the top where big eared jackrabbits might be seen. Keep your camera ready as road runners are fast but you might get a picture, and the burros are much slower -- they will pose longer.      The road will take desert adventurers back down to Highway 95. A left turn goes into Searchlight, another mining town which, in its heyday around 1902 was more populated than Las Vegas. Today about 500 residents call this town home.      A few buildings are left from the mining days. Searchlight has modern structures, too -- gas stations, places to get a drink and some food, including McDonalds. Las Vegas is one hour from Searchlight and 30 minutes from Laughlin.

The Inn at Little Washington is using mannequins for safe social distancing practices, but they may have created a real-life horror movie instead. The three Michelin-star restaurant in Virginia is planning on opening its doors soon and will only be able to accommodate 50% of their normal capacity for social distancing. Safety is the big concern at The Inn at Little Washington and they are going out of their way to make sure customers are comfortable when they open their doors again. The human customers will be placed amongst the mannequins, which is pretty creepy, to say the least.
