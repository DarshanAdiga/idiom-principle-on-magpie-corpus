Democrats are being countered financially by the Republican State Leadership Committee, which also coordinated the GOP's successful effort a decade ago.
 According to the Republican committee, the outcome of as few as 42 state legislative races in 10 states could determine control of as many as 136 seats in Congress, when accounting for the potential swing from the most Republican- leaning maps to the most Democratic-tilted districts that could be drawn by the victors.
 "The margins are extremely tight, and the stakes are extremely high, and it's going to determine what this country looks like for at least the next decade, possibly two," said RSLC President Austin Chambers.
 Even as Democrats made gains in the 2018 midterm elections, Republicans still hold full control in 29 of the 49 partisan state legislatures, compared to just 19 for Democrats. Nebraska's single-chamber legislature is officially nonpartisan. Minnesota has the only politically split House and Senate.
 Democrats stand a good chance of winning the two seats needed to flip Minnesota's Republican-led Senate. That would give Democratic lawmakers and Gov. Tim Walz full control over redistricting.
 Though Republicans hope to flip Democratic legislative control in New Hampshire, they are largely on defense this year. They are fighting to retain legislative chambers in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas, all of which give lawmakers a role in redistricting. Republican legislative control also is at stake in Arizona and Michigan, although both states will use independent commissions to handle redistricting.
 North Carolina's legislative elections are particularly important because the governor cannot veto maps drawn by the House and Senate. Some candidates there are running in a different district for the third time in as many elections, after courts repeatedly tossed out maps passed by the GOP-led Legislature.
 Some North Carolina Democrats are running on a pledge to support the creation of an independent redistricting commission.
 "Extreme partisan gerrymandering and repeated efforts to restrict voting rights have prevented North Carolinians from holding their representatives accountable, and that's just unacceptable," said Democrat Terri LeGrand, who is challenging Republican state Sen. Joyce Krawiec in a district that includes part of the Winston-Salem area.
 Krawiec said she doubts it's possible to assemble a truly nonpartisan redistricting commission and doubts Democrats would follow through with it if they won legislative power. For more than a century until 2011, Democrats drew North Carolina districts that "were extremely gerrymandered, and they're much better now," Krawiec said.
 A lot also is at stake in Texas, which is second only to California in congressional representation and is likely to gain even more U.S. House seats when the census measures its rapid population growth. Republicans currently hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Texas Legislature and nearly two-thirds of its congressional delegation.
 But Democrats need to flip just nine seats to take control of the state House for the first time since 2002. Doing so would give them a blockade against Republican measures on abortion, immigration and voting rights that have roiled the Texas Capitol for years. It also would give Democrats a say in the redistricting process.
 The Democratic targets include nine Republican-held districts in the Dallas, Houston and San Antonio areas that Democrat Beto O'Rourke carried in his narrow U.S. Senate loss in 2018. This year, O'Rourke is helping coordinate hundreds of thousands of phone calls in those districts urging voters to support the Democratic candidates.
 One of those districts, on Houston's west side, reflects the GOP's slipping grip on the suburbs nationally.
 The retiring incumbent, Republican Dwayne Bohac, drew national attention in 2013 for a bill that he said protected public school teachers to say "Merry Christmas" on campus. He won reelection the next year by a 3-to-1 margin.
 But in his last election in 2018, Bohac prevailed by a mere one-tenth of percentage point in a race that helped the GOP withstand a Democratic wave.
 This year, Democrat Akilah Bacy had raised more than twice as much money as Republican Lacey Hull heading into the final month of campaigning for the open seat. Though it's a big deal to the party, Bacy said she knows redistricting power is not a top-of-mind issue for most voters in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and a shaken economy.
 "If we flip the Texas House, redistricting is coming up! And people are like, 'What are you talking about?'" Bacy said. "I just try to talk about the issues that matter most. The basic, kitchen-table issues."
 Chambers, the head of the Republicans' state elections organization, said he thinks the GOP can hold onto the Texas House, "but it's going to be a fight all the way until the end."
 Democrats "would need to have a perfect night" to flip the Texas House, said Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
 The challenge, she said, is that "we're running on Republican-drawn maps that were designed to sustain high-water marks of Democratic performance,"

 Lucy Powell, business spokeswoman for the opposition Labour Party, accused the government of "dithering" and said the country was now facing a longer lockdown than if Johnson had acted sooner.
 Owners of businesses that have struggled to get back on their feet since the first lockdown was eased said the impact of new closures would be devastating.
 A government program that has paid the wages of millions of furloughed employees during the pandemic ends Saturday, replaced by less-generous measures that are likely to bring a surge in unemployment.
 "People have borrowed up to the hilt and spent money in order to get COVID- secure," said Kate Nicholls of pub and restaurant industry group Hospitality U.K. "There is no spare capacity in the tank to be able to fund a lockdown, even for three to four weeks."
 The U.K. is recording more than 20,000 new coronavirus infections a day, and government statisticians say the true figure is far higher. The Office for National Statistics estimated Friday that 1 in 100 people in England, well over half a million, had the virus in the week to Oct. 23. On Saturday the country is likely to surpass 1 million confirmed cases since the outbreak began.
 The U.K. has Europe's highest coronavirus death toll at more than 46,000.

Scotland finally ended their long wait for an away win against Wales with a 14-10 success in their Six Nations finale that spoilt home captain Alun Wyn Jones' record-breaking appearance.
 This was Scotland's first win on Welsh soil since 2002 and also meant they ended the coronavirus-delayed tournament having won three successive Championship matches for the first time in 24 years.
 By contrast, the result saw reigning Six Nations champions Wales suffer a fifth successive loss in all Tests under coach Wayne Pivac.
 Scotland replacement hooker Stuart McInally's try just after the hour mark proved to be a crucial score.
 Although Leigh Halfpenny cut the visitors' lead to 11-10, Scotland captain Stuart Hogg put the result beyond doubt when he landed a penalty with the last kick of the game after impressive flanker Jamie Ritchie won a turnover.
 It was not the way Wales captain Jones would have wanted to mark his 149th Test as he took sole possession of an international appearance record he had shared with 148-time capped Richie McCaw, New Zealand's now-retired World Cup- winning captain.
 A match delayed by several months was played behind closed doors at Llanelli's Parc Y Scarlets after Wales' Cardiff headquarters was commissioned as a field hospital by the Welsh government in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
 There was a minute's silence before kick-off to mark support for Rugby against Racism and to remember former Llanelli, Wales, and British and Irish Lions wing JJ Williams, who died aged 72 on Thursday.
 Wales, fresh from a 38-12 defeat by France, were forced into a late change shortly before kick-off when flanker Justin Tipuric had to withdraw with tonsilitis.
 Scotland fly-half Finn Russell was handed a first Test start since last year's World Cup after patching up his relationship with Dark Blues coach Gregor Townsend.
 Meanwhile Hogg and lock Jonny Gray returned after helping Exeter win an English Premiership and European Champions Cup double with Exeter.
 Russell missed with an early penalty before landing a 35-metre chance.
 But the Scots paid for failing to make more of their early dominance when Wales scored the opening try of the match nine minutes before half-time with their first entry into the visitors' 22.
 Scotland hooker Fraser Brown was off-target with his throw to the back of a line-out and the Wales forwards pounced, with prop Rhys Carre surging over and fly-half Dan Biggar converting to put the hosts 7-3 up.
 Falling behind was made worse for Scotland when Russell limped off what appeared to be a groin injury, with Hastings coming on as a replacement.
 Hastings, the son of Scotland great Gavin, cut Wales' lead to a point when he landed a 22-metre penalty with the last kick of the first half.
 Wales lost their No 10 as well when Dan Biggar went off injured early in a scrappy second half.
 The match came to life just after the hour with a Scotland try.

To further strengthen its support for Canadian customers, Meyer Sound has assumed distribution responsibilities for Canada and appointed Franck-Olivier Fabry as the new sales manager.
  _Franck-Olivier Fabry._
 Working closely with the Berkeley, CA headquarters, Fabry is tasked with supporting the Canadian customer network by facilitating sales, technical assistance, and design services.
 Fluent in both English and French, Fabry comes to his new post with over 14 years of experience in pro audio sales, much of it in the Canadian market. For 12 years, he held top-level sales positions at Bosch Security Systems (previously Telex Communications), where he handled sales for lines such as Electro-Voice, Dynacord, Midas, Klark Technik, and Bosch in Canada, the United States, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East.
 Fabry also directed global sales efforts at Williams Sound. GerrAudio was formerly the Canadian distributor for Meyer Sound.
 "We are grateful for the dedication and hard work of GerrAudio in the past 25 years," said Antonio Zacarias, Meyer Sound's vice president of worldwide sales. "As Meyer Sound takes over Canadian distribution and with Franck's wealth of industry experience, we are in a great position to build upon our momentum in Canada and provide customers with more direct access to our full range of services."
 "Meyer Sound's product quality is respected worldwide, and no other company provides customers with such a high level of comprehensive support," said Fabry. "I believe that success comes naturally when we're enthusiastic about what we do, and I look forward to bringing new energy and passion to serving the company's Canadian customers and consultants."
 Born in Paris to French and Swiss parents, Fabry lived in both countries before moving to the United States. He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in business from France's Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Toulon and the University of Aix-en-Provence, respectively.

"July, August and September have been really, really busy, probably some of the busiest months I've experienced in the golf business and certainly in recent years," said Weibring Golf Club at Illinois State professional Tom Szymoniak. "Obviously it's still a challenging year with concerns about things going on in our world today, but I think golf is one of the things people are comfortable doing.
 "Without a lot of events and things like that to grab attention it's one of those things that has been beneficial for the golf business, a little shot in the arm."
 There was no golf in April because of Pritzker's executive order. Courses were allowed to open May 1 but with only twosomes, 15-minute tee time intervals and no carts except for those with physical disabilities.
