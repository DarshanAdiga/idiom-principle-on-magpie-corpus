Gary Allen Fiebick
 1942 -2020
 Gary Allen Fiebick, loving husband, father, and grandfather,passed away July 30, 2020, ending his battle with Alzheimer’s Dementia.
 Born December 30, 1942 in Richmond, CA to Theodore Fiebick and Frieda Lindeman Fiebick, he was raised in Stockton, CA and St. Maries, Idaho, where he graduated high school and played basketball and baseball. Gary joined the Navy and served as a communications specialist from 1960-1963 in Kamiseya, Japan.
 After his service, Gary attended the University of Idaho and became the first in his family to graduate college, with his BA in Business Education. He then moved to Redmond, Oregon to teach at Redmond High School. He met and married his wife, Jane Richman, in 1969 and they had one daughter, Tara.
 Gary moved on to sell real estate in Sunriver, OR, eventually becoming VP of Real Estate and Marketing for Sunriver Development Corporation, helping secure the land purchase that would become Crosswater. He later worked on the development of Awbrey Glen golf course community in Bend, OR, then returned to Sunriver as General Manager of the Homeowners Association. He slowed down in “retirement” to simply sell real estate and play golf.
 Gary was known for his love of golf, “I never saw a course I didn’t want to play.” He enjoyed traveling to Arizona in the winter, discovering family heritage in Germany, and cheering his daughter and then grandkids in their sports. He will be remembered for his service to his community through Sunriver Community Church and Eastmont Church, his love of basketball and 20+ years as a high school basketball official in Central Oregon, and his loving dedication to his family.
 Gary is survived by his wife, Jane of Bend, OR, daughter Tara (Chris) Cooper and grandkids Caden and Ellie of Redmond, OR, sister Virginia Blades of Mesa, AZ, beloved brother-in-law and sister-in-law Walt and Janet Edmonds of Salem, OR, and loving nieces, nephews, and grand-nieces and nephews.
 A memorial service for family and friends will be held outdoors at Eastmont Church in Bend on Saturday, September 19, at 1:00 pm. (covid health pre- cautions will be observed) In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to Eastmont Church at www.eastmonchurch.com.

The trade-off is worth it, though, because the new episodes feel deeper and more emotionally complex than _Pen15_ was even at its Season One peak: the ninth episode, "Anna Ishii-Peters," where Maya grew jealous of how her mom seemed to like Anna more than her own daughter. "Anna Ishii-Peters" was almost startling in how clear, insightful, and occasionally sad it was relative to the juvenile antics the girls had been up to in earlier installments. In the new season, _Pen15_ goes to that same place more regularly. The girls are still doing dumb things, like joining the school wrestling team solely as an excuse to be near their crushes, but even those shenanigans have more of a core of truth to them. In one episode, the friends (who have no doubt watched both _Practical Magic_ and _The Craft_ many times) convince themselves that they are witches with magical powers. Much of what they do is absurd and over the top (and both stars utterly commit to the lunacy of it), but it's also inescapable that the motivation behind their batty behavior -- like a lot of this season's action -- lies in Anna's fear that her parents may be getting a divorce. (Still, even there, the show finds room for sophomoric humor, like Anna explaining that she protected Maya from a spell using an invisible energy glove that "can also pull your farts out of your butt.")

Meanwhile, in our current configuration of the American political order, the focus on a legislative approach to eliminating abortion has led to a neglect of other important aspects of creating a social order committed to the flourishing of human life from womb to tomb — attention to safeguarding the environment that sustains human life, reducing economic inequality, rectifying injustices rooted in race and gender that have perpetuated patterns of human relation that are to the detriment of life's flourishing, reducing military threats to human life (especially through reducing, or eliminating, nuclear weapons), and reforming the criminal justice system are a few things that come to mind in this connection.

Anantnag (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], September 15 (ANI): Construction of residential quarters for migrant pandits in the Vessu area of Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag district is now in full swing under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's relief package for Kashmiri migrants in the union territory.   Three out of the five planned buildings have been completed and they have been allotted to migrant pandit government employees.   "The newly constructed buildings are very good. The process had slowed down for a few months due to COVID-19 and the labourers had gone to their hometowns. Now they have come back and construction is happening at a very good speed. Many families live here now and are very happy to be living with their community," Vijay Raina, the local Sarpanch told ANI.  
 He further said, "Ever since the abrogation of Article 370, development has been taking place at a never-seen-before speed. There is no more political interference and the very rapid advancement is taking place. I do not think development is taking place this fast anywhere else in the country, be it the construction of roads or water supply. Those who had never seen electricity before now have it 24/7. I am very grateful to the government," he added.   The new buildings are being constructed under the Centre's Prime Minister's Employment Package (PMEP)   Not only are these new residential buildings providing homes for migrant pandits in the union territory, but it is also giving employment opportunities to labourers who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   "Along with about 60 other labourers I came from Bihar to work here after the COVID-19 lockdown was eased. We are able to earn money and are very happy. For now, we don't have to worry about the future," Sharafat Ali, a labourer said . (ANI)

This season's bobsled and skeleton world championships were awarded to Altenberg, Germany, and moved out of Lake Placid, New York, on Tuesday because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and potential travel complications.
   
 The International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation said it made the move "to protect the health of athletes and spectators across the globe." Lake Placid will be awarded the 2025 world championships instead.
   
 "The decision wasn't easy, as you can imagine," said Heike Groesswang, the IBSF's secretary general.
   
 The IBSF plans to release the updated schedule for the entire bobsled and skeleton season, including World Cup races, later Tuesday.
   
 "I think in a perfect world we want to be competing against the world's best in front of a home crowd," USA Bobsled and Skeleton CEO Aron McGuire told The Associated Press. "And so, it's disappointing to not be able to compete on home ice this year, but we certainly understand, and we want to make sure that the athletes are in the safest environment as they can be."
   
 Concerns with going forward with the event in Lake Placid as planned included the possibility that athletes from some nations would be unwilling or unable to come to the U.S. during the pandemic; an uncertainty about whether Mount Van Hoevenberg -- the site of Lake Placid's sliding track -- would be able to have fans present; and the lack of clarity about whether a lengthy quarantine period would be required for those coming into the area for the championships.
   
 Most of the athletes in the world championships would be coming from Europe.
   
 "Our strategy was to have less time spent in quarantine," Groesswang said.
   
 Giving Lake Placid the 2025 world championships keeps the same timeline as would have been in place this year, with the Adirondack Mountain village playing host to worlds in the season immediately before an Olympics.
   
 Altenberg played host to bobsled and skeleton worlds this past season as well; Germany won gold medals in men's skeleton, women's skeleton, two-man bobsled and four-man bobsled. The other gold went to the U.S., with Kaillie Humphries driving to the women's bobsled title.
   
 "I was super excited for a home world champs ... but I'd be super happy and all on board for taking it back to Altenberg as well," Humphries said.
   
 Both world championship events in sliding for this winter have now been moved from North America. Luge's world championships, which were scheduled for this coming February in Whistler, Canada, will now be held in Konigssee, Germany -- also primarily because of concerns about quarantines for foreign athletes. Konigssee was announced as the new site Tuesday when a revamped World Cup luge schedule was revealed, a list that includes a possible World Cup in Lake Placid in January.
   
 Luge condensed its schedule considerably, now planning two races at Igls, Austria, including the annual season opener; two in Konigssee including worlds; and possibly two in Oberhof, Germany. It's highly unusual for tracks to host two races in the same season.

On Sept. 11, 2001, a reclaimed strip mine in a desolate field near Shanksville was forever transformed when the passengers and crew members of United Airlines Flight 93 thwarted an attempt by terrorist hijackers to crash the plane into the nation’s Capitol, a short 18-20 minute flight away.
 This past Friday morning — the 19th anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks and the heroism displayed by those 40 people aboard Flight 93 — a private memorial service was conducted at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Somerset County. At the request of the Families of Flight 93 and in order to adhere to Pennsylvania’s public health guidelines, the park grounds remained closed until the end of the memorial service.
 Stephen M. Clark, superintendent of the Flight 93 National Memorial, opened the memorial observance at the memorial just before 10:03 a.m., to commemorate the moment Flight 93 impacted the earth.
 “Nineteen years ago the passengers and crew of Flight 93 bonded together and prevented a hijacked airplane form reaching its intended target in Washington, D.C.,” Clark said.
 “Their sacrifice saved an untold number of lives. Since that day, these special people will always be remembered as heroes to Americans and around the world. They continue to be a testament to the best of human kind. We remember and on this special day come together to honor them.”
 The names of the 40 passengers and crew members were read by MaryJane Hartman, retired chief of interpretation at the Flight 93 National Memorial, while retired FBI agents Andrea Dammann and Roy Cavan rang the Bells of Remembrance.
 Ed Root, a cousin of flight attendant Lorraine G. Bay and vice president of Families of Flight 93, spoke on behalf of the families of the 40 heroes. He spoke of how that day changed the collective lives of those family members who were thrust together from different walks of life to share a common heartbeat.
 “We came as strangers to a strange land,” Root said about the first visits to the site. “On the first anniversary, we gathered to remember. We began to learn about each other and our family members who lost their lives on that day.”
 He told of the respect and support from the local community throughout the early years before the memorial was developed.
 “This magnificent memorial was established in 2002 and dedicated to the proposition to allow all who visit to remember the collective acts of courage of the passengers and crew. We revere these grounds as the hallowed resting place of those who chose to make a difference,” Root said. “We must always remember and honor those who ran into flames of buildings and into the cockpit of Flight 93.”
 David L. Bernhardt, secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, said the department is entrusted to serve as the guard of national parks, monuments and battlefields.
 “Each site tells America’s story. They tell of exceptional actions by incredible heroes — none more than this site of 40 incredible heroes,” Bernhardt said.
 President Donald J. Trump reached out to the family members and loved ones of the Flight 93 passengers and crew members with words about their courage.
 “Nineteen years ago on this day, at this very hour, on this field, 40 brave men and women triumphed over terror and gave their lives in defense of this nation. They are on the eternal roll call of American heroes,” Trump said.
 The president condemned the terrorist acts at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. He praised the countless heroes who rushed in to help rescue those buried in the rubble in New York City and Washington, D.C.
 “The terrorists on Flight 93 had a fourth target, our nation’s capitol, just 20 minutes away. The only thing that stood between them was the courage and resolve of those 40 men and women, the amazing crew and passengers,” Trump said. “With their last act on this earth they saved our (U.S. Capitol Building) in this Pennsylvania field, those 40 intrepid souls of Flight 93 died as true heroes. Their momentous deeds will outlive us all.”
 Trump recognized many in the audience for their heroic actions that day as well. He spoke about the ambassadors who stood vigil at the resting place long before it was a national memorial. Trump concluded with a pledge to never forget all of those heroes who stepped up that day and carry forward the noble legacy of the brave souls who gave their lives for their country nearly two decades ago.
 “When history called, they did not hesitate, they did not waver. Forty towering patriots rose up, took charge, made their stand, turned the tide and changed the course of history forever,” Trump said.
 The president and first lady participated in the wreath-laying ceremony at the Wall of Names alongside Ed and Nancy Root. The service concluded with the playing of “Amazing Grace” by bagpiper Marissa Yee.
 After attending the ceremony at ground zero in New York earlier in the day, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden visited the Flight 93 memorial later Friday, following the ceremony, and laid a wreath and greeted relatives of victims including First Officer LeRoy Homer.
 According to the Associated Press, Biden expressed his respect for those aboard Flight 93, saying sacrifices like theirs “mark the character of a country.”
 “This is a country that never, never, never, never, never, never gives up,” he said.

The new season is a bit more serialized, with one arc involving the arrival of new girl Maura (Ashlee Grubbs), who attempts to turn this longtime duo into a trio, while another places Anna and Maya on opposite sides of the cast/crew divide for the school play. The girls fight, pull away from each other, and reconnect in ways that feel smart and true and at times incredibly sweet. Anna and Maya still have a lot of growing up to do, but they're capable of learning lessons along the way, like recognizing the double standard they'll be held to by being branded sluts for fooling around with a boy who, as Maya acknowledges, is "just a player" now.
