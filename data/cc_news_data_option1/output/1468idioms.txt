On Saturday, CNN visited the hospital. Five refrigerated storage units could be seen in the parking lot.
 And, in another photo obtained by CNN from an emergency room worker, body bags are shown overlapping each other inside a refrigerated unit at the hospital.
 Two other ER workers confirm to CNN that they have personally seen victims placed like this inside the units due to the growing number of bodies.
 They say that blue bags shown in the photo are the personal effects of the deceased.
 "Bodies are definitely double stacked on the floor. There is no lift to help put the bodies on the shelf," said one ER worker who has witnessed similar scenes of bodies.
 In response to a call for comment, hospital spokesman Brian Taylor told CNN, "Patients who pass away at our hospital are treated with respect and dignity, remaining on-site until they can be appropriately released."
 He added, "Like hospitals in New York and elsewhere, we have secured additional resources such as mobile refrigeration units to help temporarily manage the capacity issue caused by COVID-19."
 Six ER workers told CNN that the hospital was treating about 100 to 130 patients at a time during a period in early April when it was at its highest volume. Over the past several days, according to the workers, the case load has dropped significantly to about 50 patients, which they say is a more manageable number.
 Taylor said the hospital was focused on bringing in additional nursing resources to help care for the increase in cases.

He is not asking to be released from custody, which he would need to take up with a judge.Manafort has been behind bars since June 2018. He’s serving a 7.5-year sentence for bank and tax fraud and foreign lobbying-related crimes.The charges he was convicted on stemmed from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s 2016 election interference.Copyright 2020 CNN.

“I’ve gotten so many texts and a calls,” Dyar said during the city council meeting Monday night. “So many have asked how they could help, if we needed anything … one even said, ‘Whatever you need, we’ll be there.’ That’s meant a lot, and I just want to say thank you to all of those.”
 In a clean up effort that is expected to take weeks — if not months — to complete, Dyar said he’s been overwhelmed by the support of the community and appreciated everyone who’s taken part in helping Boaz rebound.
 “It’s been a total team effort,” he said.
 Each city department has played a vital role in the clean up effort, Dyar said, with the street, fire and police departments leading the way.
 “I think they worked all night [Sunday] night getting the streets cleaned up the best they could,” Councilman Mike Matthews said.
 But Dyar said there have been many more to lend a hand. Members of the parks and recreation department helped clear debris from U.S. Highway 431, and several more people from out of town were aiding in relief efforts.
 “To go over to Lee Avenue, see people putting tarps out, that chose not to go to work to help out a friend, relative or neighbor … it said a lot about our community,” Dyar said. “It was a reflection of who we are as a community.”
 Dyar was also thankful for the support of area churches.

"Cut the mustard" test

African countries are seething over accounts that Africans are battling stigma and discrimination in China over the coronavirus pandemic, apparently linked to a cluster of cases in the Nigerian community in the southern city of Guangzhou.
 The African residents say they have suffered forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus tests and face discrimination in restaurants and hotels.
 "We saw images of Nigerians in the streets with their possessions and this was of course extremely distressing for us at home," Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama told Chinese ambassador Zhou Pingjian on Tuesday.
 He said the situation was "unacceptable" to Nigeria's government and people, and demanded "immediate action" from the Chinese authorities.
 The African Union on Saturday expressed its "extreme concern" about the situation in Guanghzou and called on Beijing to take immediate corrective measures.
 The controversy coincides with a Chinese charm offensive in Africa.
 Diplomats said around 20 African countries are drawing up a joint letter to Beijing to say that mass virus tests and quarantines imposed specifically on Africans amount to "racism".
 The draft letter, a form of diplomatic correspondence called a note verbale, describes this as a "clear violation of human rights", the sources say.
 \- Racism issue -
 Local authorities in Guangzhou, a city of 15 million, said at least eight people diagnosed with coronavirus had spent time in the city's Yuexiu district, known as "Little Africa".
 Five were Nigerian nationals who sparked widespread anger after reports surfaced that they had broken a mandatory quarantine and been to eight restaurants and other public places instead of staying home.
 Several Africans told AFP they had been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels. One said he had been sleeping under a bridge for four days and could not find a store that would allow him to buy food.
 On Sunday, as international pressure mounted, the foreign ministry in Beijing issued a statement saying the country attached "great importance to the life and health of foreign nationals" and rejected all "racist and discriminatory" remarks.
 The US fast-food chain McDonald's apologised after a sign in one of its restaurants in Guangzhou told black people they were banned from entering.
 \- Embarrassment -
 The global pandemic was caused by a novel form of coronavirus that scientists say leapt the species barrier to humans through a live animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
 China has reacted furiously to any references that it says could spur xenophobia because of the virus's origins.
 In the context of Africa, the affair is diplomatically embarrassing for China, as it has sent doctors, medical equipment and other help to impoverished countries in Africa imperilled by the virus.
 The hugely appreciated gestures include a team of 15 doctors who arrived in Abuja last week aboard a plane filled with anti-coronavirus gear including a consignment of 50,000 masks and 11,000 rubber gloves that landed Tuesday morning in South Africa, the continent's worst-hit country.
 The United States in recent years has seen its clout in Africa wane as China has thrown open the credit spigot, providing billions in loans for Chinese- made infrastructure projects.
 Washington has been quick to point the finger in the latest storm.
 "The abuse and mistreatment of Africans living and working in China is a sad reminder of how hollow the PRC-Africa partnership really is," a State Department spokesperson said on Saturday, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China.
 "At a time when we should be supporting one another to recover from a pandemic, PRC officials recklessly hid from the world, Chinese officials are busy evicting African students into the streets without food or shelter."

Swapping the stages of pubs and clubs for their living rooms and gardens a host of performers slipped into their glad rags and eye-catching make-up to toast those on the coronavirus front line. Singing a version of You Raise Me Up, the first part of the recording is filmed in sombre monochrome, before bursting into colourful life and showcasing a kaleidoscope of glamorous looks. Sexual health worker Kyle Hussey, who has resurrected his alter ego Eva Jenna Talia for the performance, said it was to show there was "light at the end of the tunnel" Mr Hussey, 32, from Caister said the video, which was viewed over 5,000 times in its first few hours, was the brain child of Norwich drag act Christopher Thomas Nicholl aka Miss Crystal. The local winner of drag idol, who often performs as part of a duo the Squirrel Sisters, was hailing the work of the NHS and key workers and the positivity of the weekly clap when he hit on the idea of harnessing the talents of the drag performers. Now the aim is to reach as many NHS workers as possible with the Drag Queen Choir's heartwarming thank you performance. "We all know each other from the drag scene and it was nice to bring us all together," Mr Hussey said. "My character has been retired for about five months due to my ill health. "And in a way coronavirus has brought her back. "Due to self isolation I have been entertaining people via Facebook on a Sunday. "It has given me an opportunity to perform again." Mr Hussey added that the huge impact of Covid-19 meant it had been felt in every corner of society and that he had been "overwhelmed by love and support" since the video was first shown. One positive consequence was that people in the LGBT community and working in the NHS felt more included and welcome since the rainbow flags, the symbol of the Pride movement, had been adopted by the NHS. "The Pride movement uses the rainbow flag and that has been adopted by the NHS movement. "I have friends in the NHS and they now feel more wanted and included," he said.

French football clubs are making plans to resume playing and finish the current season by late July despite President Emmanuel Macron's announcement on Monday night that the country's coronavirus lockdown would continue until May 11.
 In a television address four weeks after the strict lockdown began, Macron said the measures would be extended by another four weeks as France battles to contain the pandemic which has killed more than 15,700 people in the country.
 However, he added the restrictions could be eased from then if current positive trends continued, providing a glimmer of hope to the country's clubs who have been out of action since March 13.
 The suspension of the season means clubs in France are facing a financial crisis as revenue streams have been switched off, with broadcasters refusing to pay the latest instalments of TV contracts to show live matches.
 Even all-powerful Paris Saint-Germain, with their stratospheric wage bill, are impacted, and getting games back on is therefore crucial, although there seems little prospect of fans being allowed into stadiums any time soon with Macron ruling out any large gatherings before mid-July.
 Teams will not be able to train before the lockdown ends anyway, but the best- case scenario would see matches resuming in June behind closed doors.
 That is what is being considered by other European leagues, with negotiations taking place in Germany to see if the Bundesliga could resume in early May in empty stadiums.
 "We have not considered being able to play in front of crowds for a while now," one French league (LFP) official told AFP.
 The LFP is targeting starting next season on August 23 but remains intent on completing the current campaign first, in keeping with the commitment made by European football's governing body UEFA. There are 10 rounds of games remaining in Ligue 1.
 One LFP official says the "favoured scenario" would see the season resuming on June 17, with teams playing twice a week until July 25.
 However, that scenario is also likely to hinge on UEFA -- who will hold a key meeting on April 23 -- agreeing to complete the Champions League and Europa League in August.
 French clubs are desperate to ensure next season starts with as little disruption as possible, especially as a lucrative TV deal with Spanish group Mediapro is set to kick in worth a record 1.15 billion euros ($1.26 billion) a year.
 Their outlook is optimistic, but the reality may prove very different.
 "There is not much certainty right now," one Ligue 1 club president said. "What will happen if we need to go into lockdown a second time after May 11?"

 PLASMA SOUGHT FROM VIRUS SURVIVORS
 People who have recovered from COVID-19 are being encouraged to donate plasma, which may be useful in helping other patients recover from the illness.
 The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said "convalescent plasma" has been used to prevent or treat new viral diseases in the past because people who have fully recovered have antibodies that potentially work against the virus.
 Eligible donors include those at least age 18 who had a previous positive test for COVID-19, have been free of symptoms for at least 14 days, and who are not pregnant. There is no payment for plasma donations.
 Those interested should contact health care facilities in their areas.
