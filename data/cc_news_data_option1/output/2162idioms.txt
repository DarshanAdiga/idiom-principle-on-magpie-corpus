Taking the podium, Washington admitted that she didn't "have a lot to say, because I can't get my words together right now," but she wanted "everybody to know that this is what those officers took. At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families." Acknowledging that "Gianna does not have a father," Washington reflected on all of the moments that Floyd would now never get to see, stating, "he will never see her grow up, graduate, he will never walk her down the aisle," and "if there's a problem she's having and she needs her dad, she does not have that anymore."


  "I'm here for my baby, and I'm here for George. Because I want justice for him. I want justice for him 'cause he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good," Washington said before motioning to Gianna. "And this is the proof that he was a good man."


  The Tuesday statement marked the first time Washington has spoken out since Floyd's death on May 25. In a shocking video seen around the world, Floyd, who was handcuffed and not resisting arrest, was seen being restrained by three officers, including Chauvin, who knelt on his neck. Despite his cries of "I can't breathe," Chauvin never moved. A fourth police officer was seen controlling the crowd.


  While all four officers present during the incident were fired, Chauvin remains the only one to be arrested. He is currently facing one count of third-degree murder and one count of second-degree manslaughter. Following his May 29 arrest, he was transferred to Minnesota's highest-security prison, Minnesota Correctional Facility-Oak Park Heights. According to the family's attorney, it is likely that charges will be brought upon the other officers.

"Let me just say this to the President of the United States on behalf of the police chiefs in this country, please, if you don't have something constructive to say, keep your mouth shut," Acevedo said to anchor, Christiane Amanpour. Adding how the rhetoric and suggestions Trump is making are putting men and women in their early 20s at risk, Acevedo admits it's not about intimidation tactics, but rather a compassion among Americans. "It's not about dominating; it's about winning hearts and minds. We don't want people to confuse kindness with weakness, but we don't want ignorance to ruin what we have here in Houston. It's time to be presidential, not like you're on _The Apprentice_. This is not Hollywood. This is real life, and real lives are at risk."


  Since video first emerged of Floyd's death after former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin knelt on the back of his neck for more than eight minutes despite complaining he was unable to breathe, protests have erupted in nearly every city across the U.S., fighting back against police brutality, systemic racism and lingering white supremacy. Chauvin has since been arrested and charged with second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder.


  A memorial service will be held for Floyd on Thursday from 1 to 3 p.m. local time, with _Star Tribune_ reporter, Heather Brown, disclosing it will be held at North Central University. Rev. Al Sharpton will make the eulogy at the service. The service will be followed by another in Floyd's home state, North Carolina, on Saturday from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. The specifics surrounding a location for the service have not yet been announced.

Des Moines Schools Say 'Play Ball' for High School Teams

The civil unrest that’s disrupted large cities across the U.S. over the past week hasn’t come to Cullman, and local emergency response officials say there’s no credible evidence that it’s on the way — despite a lot of recent online chatter to the contrary.


  Cullman Police and other local law enforcement agencies have been monitoring social media channels to assess the credibility of posted threats and escalations of violent activity, and so far, most of what they’ve seen appears to remain in the realm of talk. But, adds Cullman Police Chief Kenny Culpepper, officers take all threats to public safety seriously, and enforcement agencies at both the local and state level have coordinated to ensure a swift response to any potential public disturbance.


  “There have been rumors to that effect from the start, and we don’t believe that the ones we’re seeing at this point are true,” said Culpepper on Tuesday. “None of those have panned out, and it’s all been social media speculation. At the same time, we do prepare just in case. We want the public to be reassured that our department, Hanceville, the Cullman County Sheriff’s Office, and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency are on the same page and that, if anything happens, we’re prepared for it.”


  Moving about Cullman, residents and visitors aren’t likely to see any extraordinary changes to interrupt the rhythm of daily life that’ve been evident in larger cities: no closed streets, businesses, or barricaded areas. But, said Culpepper, “we have increased our police presence — and will continue to do so.”


  Rioting, looting, and targeted violence all exist in a separate area of concern for law enforcement than the free exercise of the First Amendment right to assembly and free speech, and Cullman has been the scene of small- scale demonstrations in protest of last week’s police-involved death of Minnesota resident George Floyd. Those demonstrations, which have assembled every day this week at Depot Park, have remained peaceful, said Culpepper.


  “It has absolutely been peaceful; they’ve cooperated with us and have given us no problems at all,” he said. “We’ve had no issues with the folks who have been demonstrating at Depot Park. “The only real issue that we have had has been with some local people who say they’re trying to support us, and who actually are interfering with us doing our jobs, both online and out in the field.

Through the early afternoon on Saturday, May 30, the only problems with the I Can’t Breathe South Carolina protest were trivial.


  The march from Columbia City Hall to the Statehouse departed earlier than posted online, leaving some — myself included — confused when they arrived to find only stragglers on that end of Main Street. And on the capitol steps, there were some persistent issues with the PA, leaving some speakers shouting to be heard.


  But the day’s early demonstrations against George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police were still a peaceful and powerful scene. Protestors walked up the steps and turned to face the media and the police in solidarity. They sang “Amazing Grace.” Fiery speakers, including Todd Rutherford, minority leader of the state House of Representatives, got the crowd shouting and chanting with vehement, non-violent vigor.


  The subsequent march to Columbia Police headquarters was equally peaceful, with the crowd pushing uneventfully through some busy intersections and chanting that “Black Lives Matter!” and “Trump has got to go!” on their way to Justice Square in the Vista.


  When I left a little after 3 p.m., the worst that had happened as protestors and police, some in riot gear, came face to face, was some citizens moving police barricades and hurling water bottles, and one officer having to be helped back into the building when he seemed to have fainted from the heat in his heavy black gear.


  But as was the case in many other cities across the country last week, things did not remain so tame.


  As reported by _The Post and Courier_ , the bottles became rocks, and unrest spilled into the surrounding streets. Shots were fired. Four officers were injured, one seriously. Multiple cop cars, along with a branded vehicle belonging to the Vista Guild neighborhood association, were burned. Smoke billowed into the air, splashing against the skyline for those looking on from across the Congaree River.


  In addition to the vehicles, multiple businesses were vandalized.


  “People broke into the Carolina Western Pub on Lady Street, taking bottles of beer and climbing over the counter to destroy furniture,” Adam Benson and Jessica Holdman reported.


  “A red brick hurled through the original glass window of the century-old Mellow Mushroom building on Gervais Street spewed shattered glass across the pizza restaurant’s hardwood floors,” Benson and Avery G. Wilks reported the next day.


  Vista bar The Aristocrat gave aid to demonstrators. Per Benson and Wilks, owner “Mason Crowson ... spent Saturday handing out water, charging phones and hosing down tear-gassed protesters who were demonstrating outside the nearby Columbia police headquarters.”


  He and a bartender “saved some of their favorite signs that were discarded by protesters, taping them to the Aristocrat’s front window.”


  Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin declared a curfew (ratified and extended by the rest of City Council on Sunday to run through 6 a.m. Monday morning). Police, reinforced by armored vehicles, and deploying tear gas, eventually cleared the streets.


  “When protests go from being peaceful to being violent, the conversation changes,” Benjamin said. “What’s happening right now cannot and will not be tolerated in this city, not while I’m mayor.”


  “To those not from our city, I want you to take your asses home right now,” he added.


  On Sunday, protestors were out again, once more demonstrating on the Statehouse grounds and marching out into surrounding streets. But law enforcement seemed determined to nip the crowd’s momentum.


  Officers stopped marchers that seemed to be headed back to police headquarters, meeting them with red-clad emergency response personnel, and soon firing tear gas, which was also used later in the day to disperse demonstrators at the Statehouse.


  “I saw no bottle throwing, pushing or other physical attacks from protesters before police pushed forward and fired tear gas into the crowd,” Wilks tweeted of the earlier incident. “I’m not saying definitively it didn’t happen. But I was close to the front line and didn’t see it.”


  After clearing the Statehouse grounds, officers moved in a line into the Vista, Benson and Wilks reported.


  At least 20 of the 50 people who were arrested during the weekend of unrest were from outside the Columbia area.


  Benson and Wilks spoke Sunday to Lawrence Nathaniel, the activist who organized the weekend’s protests at the Statehouse:


   _“He said he felt terrible that the first devolved into violence and vandalism, and the second ended with a crowd of marchers being tear gassed at point blank range._


   _“He’d planned to keep the protests on Statehouse grounds, he said, but other activists took charge and led the crowds toward the police station both times._


   _“‘I feel like it’s on me,’ said Nathaniel, who formed I Can’t Breathe South Carolina.”_


  He detailed that the group would continue to gather at the Statehouse every day at 2 p.m. until its demands are met — an indication that tensions are far from eased.

We went undefeated in football that season and that was in no small way due to the athletic and leadership skills of Jesse. Oh, he didn’t win all of those games by himself. I had a talented group — many also from Hoosier Boys Town. I found with these young men that they would do almost anything for you if they felt that you liked them. I really didn’t find it hard to form such meaningful bonds. A dear friend, Dr. Gary Phillips once told me that with abused and neglected children, you will often find that they have what he called, “A hole in the soul,” and if you could put your hand gently in that hole, they would be yours forever.


  Football season was over and fall was giving way to light winter snows. Our three-story school was old. My classroom was on the third floor overlooking the playground below. As a teacher, you quickly learn that playground activities reveal many things: the bullies, those isolated or ignored, friendship groups and various leaders. What you tend not to see too often was the student who, though an acknowledged leader, seemed simply uninterested in his peers. That was Jesse.


  I asked him to stay late one afternoon and we talked. I asked him first why the social distance from his classmates. His answer was straight forward and simple. “Coach, it’s not that I don’t like them. I’d simply rather not play with the kids.” I lamented at how out of place and alone he felt.

It’s no accident the varsity girls team is so close and continues to grow throughout the years. Longaker credits Veloso for helping foster a community between schools. She remembers when Veloso took charge of the high school program while she was at Cunha Intermediate School.


  “Suddenly, the high school girls were showing up to our games and supporting us,” Longaker recalled. “Antonio was inviting us to open gyms. He’s done a really great job of trying to get girls of all levels involved and have experiences like that.”


  Like last summer’s trip to Sonora, a team’s preseason scrimmages and workouts can help set the tone for the road ahead. The team also brings younger players from Cunha and the high school’s own junior varsity squad to experience the dynamic and have fun with older players. As junior guard Maya Rippberger explained, those trips boosted confidence. Like many members of the team, she’s been a part of these since middle school.


  “It’s really fun. You get to hang with the older girls and it’s really cool to bond with everyone,” Rippberger said. “And it’s pretty intense. You get a lot of skills from it.”


  With group activities halted for the time being, these shared videos prompt the current team to not only stay sharp but stay connected. Veloso believes this simple interaction, although initiated through a screen, does resonate with players. It’s what they would be doing on the court in person if they could.


  “You’ve got to make sure they’re sticking with each other and talking with each other,” Veloso said. “If they were all going to school, they’d be seeing each other and saying hello. But some of these kids haven’t seen another player in about four months. And that hurts every sport because you need that interaction.”

_Crucible_ is similar in style to Epic Games' _Paragon_ and 2K Games' _Battleborn_ ; both of which failed to find and maintain an audience. _Paragon_ servers were closed down in 2018, whilst _Battleborn_ , which was hugely overshadowed by the launch of Blizzard's _Overwatch_ , is currently in the midst of a year-long phased shutdown. Like Amazon, these are well- established companies with deep pockets, and the failure of these titles to take root in the PC gaming scene is perhaps indicative of a wider issue around their make-up. The failure to commit to a single, recognisable genre may be alienating the players. Many highly successful games, including Fortnite and Warzone, have simply tweaked a familiar genre (battle royale) to add extra layers of interest, and to differentiate themselves from the competition. However, the core premise remains the same.
