Time will tell if we are at a “tipping point”. For the moment, vigilance is required by every citizen, young and old, if we are to stamp out Covid-19 and keep the virus out of our homes, hospitals, and other vulnerable settings this winter. This is not the time to squander the sacrifices made by so many over the past six months.

This all leaves the Charles City Telecommunications Utility and the City Council in a tough spot. Without a municipally-owned electric utility to subsidize a significant portion of the cost, the financing needle through which this increasingly costly project must be threaded is getting tinier and tinier. Even if the Telecommunications Utility by some miracle does get initial financing, the Utility will still have to get something along the lines of 70-80 percent of the entire internet market share just to break even. This is a risk that very few, if any, prudent banks or lenders will take on, especially over a 20- or 25-year repayment period.
 And if the financing miracle doesn’t happen, Charles City’s taxpayers will pay dearly for this dead-end project. The city has already loaned the Utility more than $800,000 to pay the consultants that got them into this predicament in the first place. Those funds were initially paid to the city in the form of property taxes. If the Telecommunications Utility can’t get financing for this project, the city’s property taxpayers will have to eat that loan, because it’s quite clear the consultants won’t be giving their fees back.
 This project was an extreme gamble from the very beginning. With the odds of financing and ultimate success becoming increasingly long, the smart play would be for the city to cut its losses and put an end to this boondoggle.
 This is not an isolated incident. There have been suspicions of other systems having similar problems, but the information has always been hidden out of view. This document misstep in Charles City is a window into the financial mess that these systems create. States and localities should be very wary of building a broadband system that will wreak havoc on their finances.

STUDENTS and parents of a private grind school are reeling today after the school announced suddenly on Thursday evening that it has shut down with immediate effect. Students of Brookfield College in Tralee, Co Kerry - the home town of Education Minister Norma Foley - were due to return to school next Tuesday.Their plans were thrown into disarray on Thursday evening when the college sent parents an email informing them that the school had been placed in liquidation and has been closed down. This came just weeks after substantial deposits were taken from parents for the coming school year.Just last week, the school had held an enrolment evening for new pupils and only hours before its closure was announced, the school's management posted on social media that they were looking forward to welcoming students back next week.By Friday morning, the school&rsquo;s social media pages and website had also been removed.The fee-paying Leaving Cert grind school caters for fifth- and sixth-year students and repeat Leaving Certificate students. The sudden and unexplained closure has left many parents out of pocket. Fees are in the region of €5,900 and many families had paid deposits of €1,500.One such student is Jude Pierse (17) from Ballyduff, near Listowel, who has hopes of studying medicine and now fears for his future.&quot;I was supposed to be going back to school next week and now I don't know what to do. All the schools are full and are not taking students.&quot;I want to study medicine and my whole future is blown apart,&quot; Jude said.&quot;They have left students high and dry and have kept our money and offered no support to help us find a new school place,&quot; he added.It is believed that up to 100 students are affected by the sudden closure including international students, some of whom have travelled to Kerry already ahead of next Tuesday's start date.In the email sent to parents, Brookfield College told students that the company has suffered a significant loss as a result of the Covid-19 crisis and that the college had now &ldquo;ceased trading&rdquo;. The company is now in liquidation.The college said the decline in new enrolments was also a factor.&quot;With regard to fees, you are now listed as a creditor of the company and the liquidators JPA Brenson Lawlor will contact you,&quot; the email stated.Parents and pupils have been critical of the last-minute email that offers no support or full explanation.Fianna Fáil Councillor Mikey Sheehy, a former student of the school, said that the closure is a &ldquo;devastating blow&rdquo; to students, parents and teachers alike. Education Minister Norma Foley has been contacted in regard to the closure by parents, pupils and local representatives.&quot;Thoughts must now immediately turn to providing school places to students who had enrolled for the up-coming school year, preferably at schools of their own choice. I have contacted Minister Foley in this regard and have urged her to prioritise these students in order to minimise uncertainty and stress to both students and parents,&quot; said Cllr Sheehy. &quot;Some of the other schools in town are now advising parents to get in touch with them as soon as possible but they are also warning that Covid-19 guidelines and timetabling of subjects will be a major factor.&quot;Brookfield College has been in operation since 1988 and it is understood that the closure will also leave up to 16 staff out of work.

A tree ripened peach needs nothing but a place for the juice to drip after your face dives into it. It is like no other fruit, with a complex bouquet of flavors that changes from peach to peach, fine-tuned by the subtle weather patterns that are different each summer. When allowed to properly ripen on a tree, the flavor of a ripe peach is joyfully explosive, which is why the orchard that grows the world's best peaches is often the one closest to your house.      Once you've gotten used to properly ripened peaches, the store-bought alternatives quickly lose their appeal. That disappointment in the available peaches is what inspired Tom and Lynn McCamant, my peach growers here in Montana, to start Forbidden Fruit Orchard, which might literally grow the best peaches in the world. No, really.      I buy their peaches by the boxload, at both Tuesday and Saturday markets in Missoula. Whether I'm enjoying them fresh or preserving them at the peak of freshness for later use, there are few local foods as shockingly special as peaches and decidedly superior to the imported version as peaches, and now is the time to get on it.      For both preserving and cooking, look for free-stone peaches, the flesh of which easily relinquishes the seed. The other category, called clingstone, are fine for eating -- you barely notice a difference. It's impossible to tell from the outside if a peach is free- or clingstone; you have to ask.      I spend the majority of my peach-eating time leaning over the sink, my face plunging repeatedly into juicy, messy peach flesh. But when peaches are in season, we can afford to mess around. Tom's favorite way is diced with heavy cream (40% fat -- the stuff at Costo in the half-gallon cartons).      I used to forever be on the hunt for new ways to preserve my peaches, so as to enjoy their sweet glory through winter. I'd can them in quart jars, spending hours in the steamy kitchen blanching and peeling and sealing bright orange peach halves in syrup, or putting away pints of jam, sometimes with blueberries or huckleberries. I finally settled on peach slices in the dehydrator as my go-to peach storage technique. Each slice is like a drop of sunshine, and they are among the most treasured items in my freezer.      During the deliciously long evenings of summer, when the coals are still warm, I've been laying peach halves on the grill, fuzzy-sides down. Sometimes I'll add pieces of chopped ham and pickled peppers to the spot where the pit used to be, and top it with cheese. When the cheese melts, I'll sometimes drizzle balsamic vinegar or reduction. The blend of fatty, fruity and savory flavors has the wide ranging complexity of bacon-wrapped cheese-stuffed fig.      I asked Tom if he'd ever tried grilling peaches, and he admitted that he had not. But he told me about a dish called peach sambal. By the time Lynn sent me the recipe I had already gotten involved with another peach sambal recipe which I'd met online. It calls for a spicy Indonesian red pepper and garlic paste called sambal oelek, which is available in most Asian grocery aisles. It also has lots of turmeric.      I've been making it with chicken, marinating whole quarters in fresh garlic, lemon, turmeric and other flavorings, along with crushed peaches, and then grilling or broiling the chicken. The balance between the turmeric, peach and chile paste is otherworldly. Only available in this world for a short, peachy time.      Peach Sambal with Chicken   Lots of people want to eat turmeric these days, as it is thought to reduce inflammation in joints and elsewhere. It's the main component of curry powder, and accordingly makes this dish taste curry-like. You can substitute curry powder of your choice for the turmeric.   Serves 4   3 pounds chicken pieces or quarters   ½ cup fresh lemon juice   ¼ cup sambal oelek (or less, depending on your spice tolerance)   ¼ cup oyster or fish sauce   2 tablespoons sesame oil   ¼ cup olive oil   3 teaspoons turmeric or curry powder   4 extra ripe peaches, cut into 1/8ths (peeled or not)   ½ cup heavy cream or coconut milk   2 tablespoons soy sauce   Salt and pepper to taste      Add lemon juice, sambal oelek, oyster sauce and sesame oil to a small mixing bowl and whisk together. Rub the chicken with olive oil and add the rest of the oil to the sauce. Rub the chicken pieces with turmeric. Pour the marinade over the chicken in a large mixing bowl.      Squeeze the peaches and add them to the bowl, and mix it all together with your hands, squeezing the juice from the peaches as you mix. Let sit for at least three hours, covered in the fridge; preferably overnight.      Grill the chicken -- or broil, if you don't have a grill available. Let it cook until the skin blackens and blisters.      While it cooks, add the remaining sauce to a pan along with the heavy cream or coconut milk, and bring it to a simmer. Season with soy sauce and black pepper.      When the chicken is done, pour the sauce over the chicken and serve. Enjoy the glorious combination of blackened, blistered skin and sweet, tangy, quietly complex, decidedly peachy sauce.      And if you have room for more, throw a few peach halves on the embers of summer.

Now it’s August 2020 and the system is projected to cost $18 million, with required bonding of up to $22 million. One must ask how the consultants missed the project cost projection by 50% and the bonding requirement by 77%. Despite numerous requests, the board refuses to release to the public the financial business plan (prepared by some of these same consultants) that might explain these discrepancies. However, it appears that the persons or entities being approached to finance this project aren’t liking whatever the business plan is revealing.
 Although the plan all along has been to finance this project with revenue bonds to be repaid solely from the revenues generated by the broadband project, Board minutes from the Utility’s July 7, 2020, closed-session meeting show that the bond market apparently has no appetite for this risky project. The documents disclosed that the Board had even pursued a federally-backed loan from the United States Department of Agriculture, but that loan would require a 15-year payback instead of the 25-year payback as the feasibility studies originally projected, making that option economically unfeasible. The minutes finally revealed that the financing consultant is now pursing local banks and regional lenders for financing. But despite trying to arrange financing for a few months now, the financing consultant indicated at the July 28 Board meeting that he was still struggling to come up with a financing proposal that would work.

Many cities and towns across the country are considering building government- owned (read: taxpayer-funded) broadband networks. The allure is that these systems will help close the digital divide and pay for themselves over time. In May, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance released a report showing that, once built, these systems often don’t get the number of customers that are promised by consultants and city officials. Now, recently disclosed documents of what was supposed to be a closed-session board meeting in Charles City, Iowa, demonstrate why pursuit of these systems can be a real drag on a city’s finances.
 Two years ago, local government officials in Charles City began pursuing the creation of a municipal broadband system. At that time, it was acknowledged even by the pro-municipal broadband consultants that no other community in Iowa had successfully built such a system without also having a municipally- owned electrical utility to help subsidize a healthy part of the construction and/or operation of the broadband utility. With the documents that were supposed to be held out of public view, citizens are seeing why no other Iowa community has been successful.
 In March 2019, the Charles City project was estimated to cost $12 million. The public was told the deal would require bonding of $12.4 million and would be repaid over 25 years using just the revenues generated by the broadband system. Using those figures, the consultants projected that roughly 42 percent of the community’s citizens and businesses would have to sign up to make it work.

MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — The state of Vermont is considering a plan to help the state’s ski resorts during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bennington Banner reports the plan being proposed by the Agency of Commerce and Community Development would come from a $133 million economic development proposal being developed for sole proprietor-owned firms and businesses that didn’t meet requirements for grant funding in earlier spending bills. Deputy Commerce Secretary Ted Brady said the industry will need help in dealing with restrictions that will limit lodging capacity and mandate social distancing. Most ski resort businesses in the state meant they were shut out of previous rounds of CARES Act business aid, he said. “When we look at winter coming forward, we know we have to put restrictions on ski areas that we haven’t published yet,” Brady told the House Committee on Commerce and Economic Development on Wednesday. “We’re anticipating having to tell them they’re going to be capacity-restricted on their lodges and capacity-restricted or travel-restricted on their hotels.” The ski industry brings about 4 million visitors to Vermont each year. “They cannot survive unless we give them some resources to do things differently, for instance getting winter tents with heaters established for day lodge operations, to put in place new ticket and new line systems so you can maintain social distancing,” he said.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A $47 million Alaska water diversion project is expected to increase flow to a lake and eventually help generate low-cost power for utility customers. The Alaska Journal of Commerce reported Wednesday that the Alaska Energy Authority began flowing water through its West Fork Upper Battle Creek Diversion Project Aug. 25. The project will raise the amount of water in nearby Bradley Lake, subsequently increasing the practical power production capacity of the Bradley Lake Hydro Project by about 10%, project manager Bryan Carey said. Bradley Lake, the state's the largest hydro plant, annually produces about 380,000 megawatt-hours of power for six electric utilities in Alaska’s Railbelt region. Bradley Lake power costs 4 cents per kilowatt-hour to produce, the energy authority said. Because the project produces some of the cheapest power in the state, more is better, said Tony Izzo, CEO of Matanuska Electric Association. “It’s pretty easy to see the benefit (of Bradley Lake) when you look at the numbers,” Izzo said. The Bradley Lake turbines are rated to produce up to 120 megawatts of power but constraints have limited its average production to about 44 MW. The supply of glacial-fed water stored behind the Bradley dam can be used by utilities to manage the variable portion of their electric loads and optimize operation of their gas-fired generators. “We want our gas turbines to be at the sweet-spot” for maximum efficiency, Homer Electric Association Board of Directors Vice President David Thomas said. “You could argue Bradley Lake is the largest battery in the state.”

We all know sunflowers (helianthus), as they are one of the most recognizable flowers. Their brilliant color and rustic charm endear them to young and old, gardener and painter. They grace gardens and fields, blooming in the latter part of the summer. Those tall stalks not only beg our attention, but they also attract birds, butterflies and bees. I will always remember driving on a back road near Baltimore and coming across a breath-taking sight of sunflowers. The countryside was glowing with these bright, canary-yellow flowers that embellished the road for a long way. I have read and seen pictures of the fields in Italy, where you see sunflowers for miles, and I felt I was experiencing that sight.      Each August, I ask my son Will to let me know when his field of sunflowers is blooming. I like to go and just enjoy the site and to pick some for the house. I am always curious which way they will be facing when I visit his field. It is fun to watch the young flowers turn eastward at dawn to greet the sun. Then, as the sun starts to rise above the horizon, these charming flowers begin their romance with the sun as they follow it across the sky. By sunset time, they will be facing west to watch the sun disappear into the horizon. Then by morning, they are all facing east again and are ready to start again.      Sunflowers come in many different colors and sizes. There are the tall ones that come to mind when someone mentions sunflowers. There are also medium- sized ones that grow to about 4 or 5 feet. Today, you can even get dwarf varieties that are quite charming, only growing to about 2 feet tall. Their colors have a wide range of hues too, going from brilliant yellow to rust, brown and amber and shades in-between.      There are also sunflowers that are continuous bloomers. This spring, I was visiting nurseries as I usually do, mask on and keeping a distance of course; I was introduced to some new plants as I roamed the isles. I always want to see what the different garden centers bring in to sell and to see which plants are the most popular.      On my ventures to nurseries, two new annual sunflowers caught my attention. The first one was named SunBelievable or Brown Eyed Girl Helianthus. It has the happy face of a sunflower with multi-branching and dwarf in size. SunBelievable has golden yellow petals that become reddish-brown towards the base and they blend well into a dark brown center. This plant does not produce seed, putting all of its energy into making a constant crop of flowers. They are cheerful looking in the container and I was told that they bloomed all summer long. I was keen to give this plant a try.      When I purchased them, they had a few blooms and I assumed as the plant grew, I would see more. They have looked nice all summer, but now they are about to explode with even more blooms. I was content with the number I was getting, but in a week, I will have a bush with even more flowers covering the plant at a time when other flowers are starting to fade.      Shortly after finding SunBelievable, I was visiting another nursery and I spotted another dwarf sunflower that was bright, clear yellow. It was named Sunfinity. This plant was about 18 inches tall with yellow, daisy-looking flowers that were quite cheerful looking. This plant was developed to give the home gardener colorful, long-lasting sunflower looking blooms that are smaller and bloom over several months. Sunfinity was created to have many stems with a multitude of blooms to flower all season long. This was a unique and different way to look at sunflowers.   They do not have the large heads of what I think of as traditional sunflowers - the bloom is only about 3 inches wide. However, the number of blooms and the length of time they have flowers make up for the size.      There are companies that specialize in all the new and exciting sunflowers and catalogs to tempt you. You can save your seeds, but remember that cross- pollination could have occurred and you might not get a flower that is exactly like the one you collected seed from. It is best to purchase new fresh seeds each year if you want a particular looking sunflower. Sunflowers are a joy to grow, and I hope I always have some to greet the morning and to brighten the countryside.

KENOSHA, Wisconsin — La fiscalía presentó cargos contra un joven de 17 años originario de Illinois por la muerte a disparos de dos manifestantes y por dejar herido a un tercero en Kenosha, Wisconsin, durante una noche de disturbios después de que la policía hirió a tiros a Jacob Blake, un hombre negro, el fin de semana pasado.
 Kyle Rittenhouse se enfrenta a cinco cargos por delitos graves que incluyen cargos por homicidio intencional y homicidio imprudencial, así como un cargo por delito menor por posesión de un arma peligrosa por un menor de edad. Rittenhouse, un adolescente blanco que iba armado con un rifle semiautomático mientras caminaba por las calles con otros civiles armados en medio de las protestas de esta semana, podría ser condenado a una sentencia obligatoria de cadena perpetua si es declarado culpable de homicidio intencional en primer grado, el delito más grave bajo las leyes de Wisconsin.
 El fiscal de distrito del condado de Kenosha, Michael Graveley, formuló la acusación el jueves.
 El ataque a disparos del martes por la noche, en gran parte capturados en vídeos de celulares y publicados en línea, junto con los disparos hechos por la policía el domingo contra Blake, un hombre negro de 29 años y padre de seis que quedó paralizado de cintura para abajo, convirtieron a Kenosha en el último punto focal en las protestas contra la injusticia racial que se ha apoderado de Estados Unidos desde la muerte de George Floyd el 25 de mayo mientras estaba bajo custodia policial en Minneapolis.
 Los dos hombres asesinados por Rittenhouse fueron identiificados como Joseph Rosenbaum, de 36 años, de Kenosha, y Anthony Huber, de 26 años, de Silver Lake, a unas 15 millas al oeste de la ciudad.
 Un tercer hombre resultó herido: Gaige Grosskreutz, de 26 años, de West Allis, a unas 30 millas al noroeste de Kenosha, quien se está recuperando después de una cirugía, dijo Bethany Crevensten, otra activista. Ella dijo que Grosskreutz se ofrecía como médico voluntario cuando le dispararon y lo llamó “un héroe”.
 Rosenbaum fue muerto a tiros primero, después de seguir a Rittenhouse a un lote de autos usados, donde le arrojó una bolsa plástica al adolescente armado e intentó quitarle el rifle, según una denuncia penal publicada por los fiscales el jueves.
 El médico forense descubrió que Rosenbaum recibió un disparo en la ingle y la espalda, lo que le fracturó la pelvis y le perforó el pulmón y el hígado derechos, y la mano izquierda. También sufrió una herida superficial en el muslo izquierdo y un rasguño en la frente.
 Rittenouse corrió posteriormente por la calle y fue perseguido por varias personas gritando que acababa de dispararle a alguien antes de tropezar y caer, según la denuncia y el vídeo. Huber, que llevaba una patineta, recibió un disparo en el pecho después de que aparentemente intentó arrebatarle el arma a Rittenhouse, según la denuncia.
 Grosskreutz, que parecía tener una pistola, recibió un disparo en el brazo izquierdo después de acercarse a Rittenhouse, según la denuncia.
 El abogado de Rittenhouse, Lin Wood, dijo que el adolescente estaba actuando en defensa propia.
 La policía de Kenosha enfrentó preguntas sobre sus interacciones con Rittenouse el martes por la noche. Según los relatos de los testigos y las imágenes de vídeo, la policía aparentemente dejó que el atacante pasara junto a ellos y abandonara el lugar con un rifle al hombro y las manos en el aire, mientras miembros de la multitud gritaban que lo arrestaran porque había disparado contra personas.
