“AAP provides content to hundreds of newspapers and radio stations, most of which are in regional areas, who couldn’t possibly each send journalists to cover what happens in our nation’s capital cities, our courts or our sporting fields,” the executives said in a joint statement.
 Opposition communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland said federal funding should have been provided months ago.
 “Why has it taken over five months for this government to respond when things are down to the wire?” she asked.
 Earlier this week, three senators who are not aligned with major parties -- Jacqui Lambie, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff -- wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison urging him to support AAP.
 They argued that funding should be provided annually for three years to ensure AAP stays afloat beyond the coronavirus economic crisis.
 The funding announced Friday is a one-off grant under the Public Interest News Gathering Program, which began in May to help media organizations maintain public interest journalism in regional areas during the pandemic.

 Melvin Martin Jr., 30, has been charged with fleeing prosecution, Markham city spokesman Michael Taylor said Wednesday.
 Martin was arrested Monday at the Markham Public Library after curious family members looked into the bags that Martin seemed preoccupied with since arriving aboard the Greyhound bus from Louisville, Kentucky, on Friday, Taylor said.
 A severed head and other body parts were found in the bags, and police in Kentucky found the woman’s torso, he said. A deputy coroner in Louisville identified her as Ladawndra Ellington, 31.

JUNIOR HURLING: Ahane’s Junior hurlers travelled to Bruff on Sunday evening to play Dromcollogher Broadford in their 5th game of the championship. They came in on the back on two loses and two drawn games. Dromcollogher Broadford started the stronger and held their dominance for the whole game. Ahane were on the back foot straight off the bat as Dromcollogher Broadford scored a goal inside the first minute. Conor Morrissey got Ahane off the mark as he scored a point. Dromcollogher Broadford popped over two points before Ahane got a goal chance that was very well saved by the keeper and knocked out for a 65’ which Johnny Meskell popped over the bar. Just before the first water break Dromcollogher Broadford broke through the Ahane defence and scored a goal that William O’Leary who had another good game between the post, could do nothing about. The scores at the first water break were Ahane 0-4 Dromcollogher Broadford 1-7. Ahane started the second quarter well and out hurled Dromcollogher Broadford for the fifteen minutes. Scores from Johnny Meskell, Patrick Minehan and Diarmuid McCarthy kept Ahane in the game up to half time. Andrew Shanahan got a super score from centre back that really got the Ahane lads going and substitute Kevin Morrissey came on and got a point within two minutes of being introduced which bought the gap to two points. Tommy Clifford then got a point and the game was down to a 1 point gap but unfortunately Ahane could never get the equalising score as Dromcollogher Broadford got a point and the gap went back to two. Half time and the score was Ahane 0-11 Dromcollogher Broadford 1-10. The second half started and Johnny got things moving for Ahane once again with a point. Tommy Clifford got another point for Ahane and the gap was back to 1. Another great save from William O’Leary ensured that the gap stayed at one. However as the half went on Dromcollogher Broadford started to move up the gears and they got another goal after a save initially from O’Leary. At the second water break the score was Ahane 0-14 Dromcollogher Broadford 2-13. Ahane were awarded a close range free but the Dromcollogher Broadford keeper saved it and it went out for a 65’. The gap came back to 5 points but again Dromcollogher Broadford upped it another gear and Ahane just couldn’t match them. Dromcollogher Broadford got a goal in the final few minutes of the game that sealed their win, but Ahane never gave up and got three more points after the goal to end the game on a score line of Ahane 1-18 Dromcollogher Broadford 3-20. A tough loss for the Ahane lads who have put in some great performances of the season. Huge thank you to Jim and Colm for all their time and dedication to the lads and to the lads themselves for all the work and effort they put in over the year.

This time Salina Central's boys got all the way to overtime before their spirits were crushed.
   
 Two days after dropping a heartbreaker to rival Salina South in the closing minutes of regulation, the Mustangs suffered a similar fate just 12 seconds into the extra period Thursday against McPherson by an identical 2-1 score at Salina Stadium.
   
 "We played well. It was just one of those plays where we need to be a little more aware," Central coach Cameron Hunter said of McPherson's game winner by Reid Schuckman on a cross from Caden Hardgrave. "If they just put the ball on our half, we have to be ready.
   
 "We just didn't get it done."
   
 McPherson went 77-plus minutes between goals, but struck quickly in overtime by putting the ball down the left side to Hargrave, who found Schuckman in front of goal for the golden-goal finish.
   
 "We've done that the whole season and we were ready to make a play," Schuckman said of the final sequence. (Hardgrave) played it on the left side for me and I shot it in the front post.
   
 "We all had a gut feeling it would happen (in overtime) and we made it happen."
   
 McPherson coach Chris Adrian, whose Bullpups improved to 2-4, said both his team's goals were rewarding.
   
 The first goal, in just the third minute, came off a Hardgrave service from the right side, with Kayden McVicker crashing the goal up the middle and knocking it in. McVicker went down in a collision after pounding it in and did not return.
   
 "Both came on things we'd worked on," Adrian said of the goals. "It was kind of a bookend of a game for us, but the stuff in the middle was very good, too.
   
 "It was a good game. Both teams were without key players, Central because of a red card (Liam Foley) and ours (Cody Achilles) due to a cross country meet, but they played well."
   
 After McPherson grabbed the early lead, Central got even in the 16th minute after the Bullpups failed to clear a Ricky Picasso corner kick. The ball rolled to the top of the box, where Will Ryan ran on and buried it in the top left corner.
   
 "If I'm going to be honest, this was a game we lost ourselves," Hunter said. "We had a couple of chances to put it away in regulation and just didn't capitalize."
   
 The Mustangs had two golden in the second half after getting behind the McPherson defense. The first came when in Picasso broke free down the middle but was brought down from behind, resulting in a yellow card.
   
 In the 75th minute, Ben Kraft sent a ball down the center for Nolan Foley, who was denied on a diving stop by McPherson keeper Kelvin Peterson.
   
 "We have a few more things to work on, but I'm proud of the boys," Hunter said. "I thought we probably played our best game.
   
 "It was a fun game, and that's what you play for. It was a tough battle."

“In a B-17, the tail section is very tight,” Kalberloh said. “To get out of the plane I had to crawl out because I was six feet tall. When the order came to bail out, I took off so fast I didn’t even unplug my oxygen mask ― I just tore it off the wall. When I got to the center of the plane where all the other guys were, I bailed out through the waist door.”
 As he landed, Kalberloh’s parachute became entangled in the top of a tall tree. The momentum of his body and the tension of the chute’s suspension lines as he bounced up and down caused the branch to break and he dropped to the ground ― alone in enemy territory without food, water or a map.
 Kalberloh had just completed his first and last bombing mission.
 After five days without eating and the possibility of being captured by more aggressive German troops in the area, such as the SS, Kalberloh finally surrendered to the constable of a small town and officially became a prisoner of war (POW).

The drug epidemic is affecting families across the nation.
   
 Mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends and colleagues are often left clueless how to help their loved ones struggling with addiction as they spiral downwards seeking to further bury underlying traumas in their next high.
   
 Programs such as the District Court's Substance Abuse Court and the Michigan State Police Angel Program aim to help addicts.
   
 The issue I see is that today's dope is exponentially more potent than what it once was. Local police and addicts alike have confirmed this.
   
 Cartel manufactured methamphetamine and fentanyl have now replaced "shake-and- bake" methamphetamine and heroin stepped on twice over.
   
 In most jurisdictions, a combination of focused narcotics enforcement by the police and programs such as the Substance Abuse Court have made some headway into tackling the problems affecting people from every social circle.
   
 Hillsdale County is lacking in enforcement, but that may soon change…I hope.
   
 The Michigan State Police led Region of Irish Hills Narcotics Office--which conducts narcotics enforcement in both Hillsdale and Lenawee counties-- recently interviewed troopers and selected a new team member for a Hillsdale County focus.
   
 And, despite the Hillsdale Narcotics Enforcement Team ran by the Hillsdale County Sheriff's Office being disbanded by former Sheriff Tim Parker due to manpower issues, incoming Sheriff Scott Hodshire appears to have a plan in place to tackle the problem: Hodshire is open to recommitting sheriff's deputies to the R.H.I.N.O. task force.
   
 Years ago, deputies were pulled out of the inter-agency co-op as they rarely worked in Hillsdale County. The issue was Hillsdale County deputies performed most of their work in Lenawee County.
   
 When HNET was in service with two deputies working narcotics enforcement one day per week, they averaged 54 narcotics cases annually, compared to nine cases brought forth for prosecution by the R.H.I.N.O. task force during the same time period in Hillsdale County.
   
 Meanwhile, pro-active officers with the Hillsdale City Police Department perform their own investigations while simultaneously performing patrol duties. More often than not, these investigations led to dealer-level weight being taken off the streets.
   
 Just recently, an HCPD officer seized four ounces of crystal methamphetamine during a routine traffic stop in the city of Hillsdale. This was unheard of six years ago when the average amount of methamphetamine found was around a gram.
   
 The problem is bigger than the average citizen knows.
   
 There's been an influx in people coming from "the city" moving dope and taking advantage of the lack of narcotics-specific enforcement in Hillsdale County.
   
 Our local drug problem often times has roots in Jackson, Adrian, Toledo and various cities in northeast Indiana.
   
 And it has direct correlations to other crimes, such as larcenies, burglaries, assaults, etc.
   
 On any given day, at least a third of the jail's inmate population has some type of underlying drug problem.
   
 While a commitment to a regional drug team such as the R.H.I.N.O. task force could make considerable headway, some remain skeptical due to the previous issue of Hillsdale County paid deputies spending most of their time working in Lenawee County.
   
 However, what is being done--or not being done--right now simply is not working.
   
 To fully understand this, we have to think back to the pre-Sept. 11 U.S. intelligence community where various agencies each had their "piece of the pie" and were oftentimes not willing to share information with other agencies.
   
 This is what narcotics enforcement in Hillsdale County looks like right now.
   
 The HCPD does its own thing through pro-active patrol officers. When HNET was active, they had their own way of doing things. And then there was R.H.I.N.O.
   
 Often times, I have thought about exactly what I would do in a hypothetical situation where I was elected sheriff. How would I address the narcotics problem?
   
 In theory, the pro-active officers from the HCPD could be sworn in as special deputies by the sitting sheriff to work cases with a refreshed version of HNET to work cases locally part-time.
   
 This plan would take some coordination with the Michigan State Police Jackson Post to place extra patrol units in the county when HNET was working so as not to completely interrupt regular road patrol duties.
   
 While HNET would focus on local issues they could coordinate regional information to regional teams such as R.H.I.N.O., the Jackson Narcotics Enforcement Team or agencies in Ohio and Indiana.
   
 The Hillsdale County Prosecuting Attorney's Office would need to be on board with this plan (really any plan) to ensure these cases are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and not settled through plea bargains where serious offenders walk with less serious charges.
   
 In a hypothetical world, this plan would work, but, admittedly, I am not an expert on narcotics enforcement, nor the sheriff.
   
 I am just someone with a little bit more inside information than the average citizen has available to them through my observations in the courtrooms, my interactions with various law enforcement officers, my conversations with those "in the game" and my background as an all-source intelligence analyst for the Department of the Army.
   
 The voters of Hillsdale County have spoken and Scott Hodshire is our new sheriff.
   
 He has quite the job ahead of him in figuring out how to properly address our drug problem with the budget and staff he has.
   
 I spoke with him briefly Monday when it was determined he would be appointed sheriff after Democratic challenger Wes Ludeker bowed out of the race for November's election and I can respect the direction he wants to take the sheriff's office.
   
 As we did in 2016 with Tim Parker, it is time we rally around Scott and Nate Lambright and support the decisions they make to best serve and protect us.
   
 Decisions that I'm sure will be difficult with the budgetary restrictions of our county.
   
 The number of overdose deaths this year alone have increased from previous years. And, unfortunately, it includes at least two names of people who have graduated from the District Court's Substance Abuse Court.
   
 All eyes are on Sheriff Hodshire now.

"I am fully aware that we do not have the luxury of time," he said in a brief statement after meeting President Michel Aoun.
 French President Emmanuel Macron had given Lebanon's main political players a two-week deadline to agree on a line-up of experts whose job would be to address multiple crises.
 The deadline expired on Wednesday with no result, prompting Macron to voice his disappointment.
 "I am counting on everyone's cooperation to form a government whose task will be to implement what was agreed upon with President Macron," said Adib.
 The French leader, who travelled to Beirut twice since an August 4 port explosion disfigured the city, had demanded Lebanon's factions set no conditions on the line-up of the crisis government.
 France had warned that the combined effects of one of the largest explosions in history and of a critical debt crisis posed an existential threat to the 100-year-old state.
 The two main Shiite groups in Lebanon's usual power-sharing arrangement, however, have insisted on retaining the finance ministry, effectively blocking Adib's efforts.
 The parliamentary bloc affiliated to the Shiite movement Hezbollah, in a statement, said it "categorically rejected" any effort to impose names or block names for "any cabinet portfolio, especially the finance ministry".
 According to political officials, the young premier-designate has been pushing for a tighter cabinet of 14 ministers while the dominant alliance in parliament wants 24.
 Lebanese media had raised the possibility he would throw in the towel if the French deadline was not met, but Adib looked set to pursue his efforts.

In years past, the Panther Valley-Marian football game has been THE game each team has circled on its schedule.
 Be it at Panther Valley Stadium or Men of Marian Stadium, there is electricity in the air, and the usual overflow crowd packs the stands and surrounds the field in anticipation of another Coal Region gridiron classic.
 Times have certainly changed.
 Due to concerns surrounding COVID-19, there will be no fans allowed at Panther Valley Stadium this evening. Both the Panthers and Colts are in rebuild mode these days, too.
 But make no mistake, tonight’s matchup of longtime rivals is no less important to the Panthers and Colts. Both are looking for a Week 2 win to gain momentum for the season ahead, and to grab bragging rights for another year.
 “It’s one of the best rivalries in the Coal Region,” said longtime Marian head coach Stan Dakosty, who has returned to the Colts’ sideline after a three-year absence. This will be his 41st PV-Marian contest as a head coach.
 “It’s kind of weird because the stadium’s normally packed. Same way with the Jim Thorpe game. Opening night would have been standing room only, and PV the same way,” Dakosty said. “But the big thing is our kids are getting to play. Some kids aren’t, and some kids may not. We’re on the verge of having a second game and that itself is a win for the program, because we needed to play somebody this year.”
 Second-year Panther Valley head coach Rick Jones will be in just his second PV-Marian game, but is well aware of the rivalry.
 “There’s kids at Panther Valley that end up going to Marian, and vice-versa,” he said. “And there were a number of years where both programs were highly- respected and good programs. I think over the years, the proximity of it, it becomes a very emotional game for a lot of people.”
 In Jones’ first season, 2019, the Panthers snapped an eight-game losing streak to the Colts with a 40-17 victory at PV. The Colts still lead the all-time series, which dates back to the 1964 season, 31-21-1.
 “They beat us 40-17 last year, and we’ve got to kind of bounce back and see if we can close that gap,” Dakosty said. “You’ve got to respect what they’ve done there and we have to play a good game in order to compete and win.”
 Both the Panthers and Colts are coming off opening-night losses to larger schools. PV fell to Class 4A Lehighton 40-12, while Marian lost to Class 3A Jim Thorpe 43-0. Rivalry aside, both teams would love to turn things around in Week 2.
 “It’s important for both teams in the sense that you want to get a win under your belt, you want to play better,” Jones said. “I think it’s important because it’s a rival as well. Both programs really want to win this game to get some momentum going forward to the next week.”
 “As good as Jim Thorpe was, we made so many first game unforced errors and we just can’t do that,” noted Dakosty. “We’ve been really preaching on that this week, and keeping ourselves focused during parts of the game.”
 Dakosty said getting off to a good start tonight “is real important. It would certainly help us.”
 The Panthers were able to out-rush Lehighton 229-134 last week on the strength of Louie Clouser’s 124 yards on eight carries, the big one an 80-yard touchdown gallop in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, sophomore quarterback Mike Pascoe added 53 yards on seven carries in his first varsity start.
 “We ran the ball fairly well, and I was really pleased with our quarterback,” Jones said. “He ran the ball well, Clouser ran the ball well. We were a little shorthanded up front, missing a player or two that will be back this week, but I thought we did some nice things. I thought we were aggressive.”
 Dakosty knows the Colts must slow the Panthers’ run game tonight. A year ago, Clouser had touchdown runs of 45 and 42 yards against the Colts.
 “Number one, Ricky’s done a great job of bringing that program around,” Dakosty said of his coaching counterpart. “They’re very disciplined, they execute well, they’ve got some really nice skill kids, and a couple exceptional linemen. It’s going to be a challenge for us.”
 The Panthers are equally concerned about Marian’s offense and its skill players, including sophomore running back Xavier Ocasio and junior wideout Luis Teron. Ocasio ran for a game-high 148 yards and an early touchdown last year as Marian built a 10-0 first-quarter lead.
 “They have some nice size. Obviously the tailback, Ocasio, we played against him last year and he had a nice ballgame against us as a freshman,” Jones said. “He’s bigger and stronger, I’m sure he’s faster, very explosive. Plus you have Stan Dakosty back, and he’s going to get that program turned in the right direction.”
 Dakosty knows it won’t happen overnight. Three-quarters of his roster is made up of underclassmen, many who have no varsity experience.
 “In the 45 years I’ve been at Marian High School, this is the most inexperienced team I’ve ever had to coach with,” Dakosty said. “It’s a great bunch of kids, but we needed to play. Jim Thorpe’s a challenge, but we didn’t play well. I think we can play better. But we got game speed, game situations, for some of our kids that haven’t been on the field ever, and some of them not since junior high school.”
 He said the play of senior quarterback Julian Cerullo was one of the positives he took from the opener.
 “I came out of our first game and gained a lot of respect for our quarterback, Julian Cerullo. He didn’t have the stats, but boy he took a pounding and stayed in there as a leader and kept his poise. He’s only going to get better from that experience last week,” Dakosty said. “He’s an athletic quarterback. I think you’ll be surprised at how athletic he is.
 “I coach the quarterbacks and I said to them today the No. 1 thing the quarterback has to bring no matter what the talent is leadership, and he brings a boat load of leadership. He’s one of our captains and he’s a guy that kind of sets the tone for the program.”
 Jones said the key to beating their rival tonight is to make strides from their opener.
 “We’ve got to stop any big plays from their run game, we have to be able to run the ball and then get a little more out of our passing game. The kids have to catch the ball better and run some better routes,” he said. “Like anything else, I’ve always believed Week 1 to Week 2 is where you make your most improvement. The big thing for us is I think we do have an idea what we want to do on both sides of the ball, so it’s just a matter of getting better.”
 With no fans allowed in the stands tonight, you can watch the game live on Blue Ridge Cable TV-13, or listen to a live broadcast on WLSH AM-1410. Kickoff is slated for 7 p.m.

Rock Bridge football has looked impressive in all three phases so far this season.
 Along with the high-scoring offense, the Bruins’ defense has come up with multiple crucial stops and turnovers when it needed them most.
 Add to that the resilient play on special teams, and it‘s clear to see why Rock Bridge has opened the season undefeated.
 The Bruins (3-0, 2-0 Central Missouri Activities Conference) will look to keep their winning ways going in their matchup against Capital City (0-3, 0-2) on Friday.
 With a win this week over the Cavaliers, the Bruins would exceed last season’s win total.
 Rock Bridge will look to build off its second-half offensive performance against Jefferson City last week. After looking stagnant and inconsistent in the first half, the Bruins started to see success moving the football late in the game.
 Running back Bryce Jackson continues to set the tone for the Bruins’ offense, with four touchdowns in the opening three games.
 “He’s not a back that’s going to break off big runs, but he’s going to get you 4 or 5 yards a carry every time,” coach Van Vanatta said.
 Jackson’s ability to apply pressure on opposing defenses benefits quarterback Nathan Dent. The threat of Jackson running the ball has also opened up the play-action passing game for the Bruins.
 Similarly, Dent takes pressure off Jackson. Dent’s ability to give Rock Bridge an added weapon in the running game makes it difficult for opponents to key in on Jackson.
 “The two have a great connection,” Vanatta said. “We’re still throwing in some wrinkles here and there, but they have good chemistry.”

JUNIOR HURLING: KDGAA 1-12 v Old Christians 2-12. We headed into our lost group game unbeaten with 3 wins and a draw. However everything was on the line against the group leaders, we needed a win to guarantee progress to the quarter finals. We started well and were 5 points to 2 ahead at the water break playing with a strong diagonal breeze. We had some excellent points from Denny Ahern, Darren Murphy, David Hannon and Denis O Dea to lead 0.9 to 0.5 at the break. Our wides total was 13 in the first half, we hoped it wouldn't prove fatal. Our lead was wiped out within 5 minutes of the restart, Croagh Kilfinny grabbing a fortuitous goal and 3 points to take the lead. Another goal left us a mountain to climb, Croagh Kilfinny led 2.10 to 1.10 at the final water break. We never gave up, and when Denny Ahern goaled from a free to leave three points between the sides, it setup a frantic last few minutes of injury time. It was not to be, and cruelty our only defeat in the group denied us progress on scoring difference. Overall we have made lots of progress during the year, simply getting back playing was a huge bonus and it wasn’t for the lack of effort or preparation that denied us at the end. Well done to all the players and management throughout the year, we still have the football quarter final to come. Many thanks to Damien O Dwyer for live streaming and commentary on the game.

For most of the season, one team has stood out at the top of the Kansas Crappie Trail.
   
 Gardner's Tony Niemeyer and Louisburg's Ryan German entered the 2020 KCT State Championship on El Dorado Reservoir with a comfortable lead in the season-long points standings and seemed like the odds-on favorite to win a state title, as well.
   
 However, anything can happen on a big-fish lake like El Dorado. And something unexpected did happen.
   
 Lawrence's Jeremy Conway and Tonganoxie's Bob Purh -- the Top Secret Jig Co. Rookie Team of the Year -- shocked the field by winning the event Sept. 12-13 with a whopping 25.51-pound two-day bag to edge out Niemeyer and German by almost a half-pound (25.01).
   
 "I knew that Puhr and Conway were good fishermen, even though they were considered a 'rookie' team that has had a respectable year," tournament organizer Dylan Faulconer said. "With that being said, I didn't think for a second that they would win leading up to the event.
   
 "It just shows that every team that fishes this series can strike at any moment, they had a great tournament and now I believe other teams will have their eyes on them in the future! They beat some teams that compete, nationally so they should be really proud of themselves."
   
 The rookie team had a strong outing on Day 1 to put themselves within striking distance of the lead. Their 13.46-pound bag Saturday put them roughly a half- pound behind Niemeyer and German, who led with 14.07 pounds.
   
 "Going into the tournament, we only had one area that we thought had the quality of fish that it was going to take to win," Conway said. "My partner, Bob Puhr, was able to find that area the weekend before during pre-fishing and that is where we started on Day 1 of the tournament. Our goal going into Day 1 was to just catch enough to stay in contention for Day 2. Fortunately that area still had the quality of fish to have us sitting in second place at the end of the day."
   
 Conway said they were initially worried they had over-fished the area going into Day 2, but they stuck with it and pulled out a decent 12.05-pound bag. But what would have been a winning bag on many other lakes left them feeling anxious on El Dorado.
   
 "Going back to weigh-in, we were for sure that we would be moving down the leaderboard and were just hoping to stay in the top five," Conway said. "Once we got back to weigh-in, we heard that the other teams had a tougher day also, but it wasn't until it was just down to the last two teams that we thought we may have a chance to win.
   
 "We were pretty shocked and excited to be able to come away with the win. That win was a great way to end what we thought was a great season for our first year. We are definitely hooked on tournament crappie fishing now and are already looking forward to next season."
   
 Despite finishing runners-up for the state title, Niemeyer and German didn't leave empty-handed. The second-place finish secured the Angler Team of the Year for the KCT veterans for the second straight year.
   
 "It was a great year, we had a lot of fun chasing the points again this year," Niemeyer said. "Our number one goal was to defend the title again for back to back years. It was a close race, for sure."
   
 Niemeyer said they were catching fish eight to 12 feet deep with his own hand- tied jigs, as they had used all year.
   
 "We fished real clean for most of the tournaments -- only two really stand out that we had costly mistakes," Niemeyer said. "Those were Melvern and the championship at El Dorado. We lost fish that really cost us in those tournaments, but that's just part of it."
   
 Riley's Frank Haidusek and Leavenworth's Dalton Thomas finished third at the state championship with a two-day bag of 24.74 pounds, including the big fish at 2.77 pounds, caught by Haidusek for an $800 payday.
   
 Topekan Dustin Hobbs finished fourth with 23.81 pounds. Faulconer, of Eudora, and teammate Allen Miller, of Baldwin City, rounded out the top five to secure a third-place finish in the season standings behind the Lawrence father-son duo of Mike and Eric Schrock, who took sixth at state with 22.87 pounds.
   
 Following the state championship, the KCT has a bevy of anglers who have qualified to compete in the Crappie Masters National Championship from Sept. 23-26 at Ouachita River in Louisiana. Teams that qualified include Purh/Conway, Niemeyer/German, Team Schrock, Faulconer/Miller, Haidusek, Topekan Brandon Manis and Meriden's Nic Luttman, and Wichita-KC duo of Derek Kruger and Kalin Caton. Conway said he and Purh don't plan to compete in nationals this year, however.
   
 "The season turned out great," Faulconer said. "The guys all had positive things to say, everyone was happy with some of the rule changes to make the competition a little more even."
   
 And he has even bigger plans in the works for 2021.
   
 NOTE: Augusta's Tom Bybee was also awarded the Big Fish of the Year award for his 3.17-pounder caught in May, also on El Dorado.

The healthcare scenario for tier II and III cities is completely different from that of tier I. When myUpchar started, there were no players focused on serving tier II and III areas. Most of the online healthcare industry was focused on the urban population; there was no quality healthcare services for tier II and III. Around 80 per cent of myUpchar's users come from tier II and III Indian cities. Telemedicine has been there for a very long time, but the COVID-19 pandemic has brought it to the forefront. For tier II and III cities, such a concept is fairly new but it surely has a great potential to transform the healthcare scenario.
 For healthcare needs, tier II and III people mostly rely on quacks for their healthcare solutions. The lack of trained staff and inferior quality of treatment is one of the major issues in such areas as it puts their life at risk. Apart from that, the current COVID-19 crisis has worsened the situation for people living in tier II and III areas. Due to the shutting down of local clinics, a major problem for doctor consultation has arisen. The subsequent lockdown has added to the difficulties as travelling long distances for treatment is challenging as well as risky. In some parts of India, heading out of the homes even to the chemist stores is not a good idea due to safety concerns. In such a scenario, telemedicine is helping in providing this audience quality healthcare services without travelling at all.
 Another big pillar of healthcare in India is the million pharmacies available even in smaller towns. However, availability of high quality medicines is an issue as pharmacies usually partner with local pharmaceutical companies and doctors to make a mini nexus. While this ensures that patient's revenue is well captured in the local ecosystem, it deprives patients of high quality medicines especially in tier II and tier III. With teleconsultations, standardized prescriptions have drug names, which will make above practice a thing of the past. By this practice, patients can get a prescription online, walk to any pharmacy and take a medicine based on drug name vs brand name. Smaller pharmacies surviving due to current nexus will either collapse or merge into pharmacy chains which will bring digital processes and transparency. Gaps in the supply chain can be quickly identified and plugged by software solutions. Pharmaceutical companies will have an end-to-end visibility of the consumption patterns and can plan better.
 There is a lack of standardization protocol seen in the practice of writing prescriptions, although this concept is being followed by the telemedicine companies. The standardization brought into practice by online players will eventually build a strong pillar in the healthcare sector for India. We can expect platforms like myUpchar offering telemeds services to be on the rise as there will be consultation demand in the market even after this tense situation ends.
 The only gap that seems to be unfulfilled at this time is the self-diagnostic services. There is a need for integrated diagnostic tools that will allow people to diagnose their ailments at home. With a little guidance, people can then diagnose their issues under a doctor's supervision. If this cavity is fulfilled, there will be very few cases that would actually require a visit to the hospital or clinics. All the proceedings from consultation to getting medicine delivered at home will then be completely online.
 Telemedicine has been in the background for a long period but the Corona pandemic has brought the facility to the forefront. The comfort of getting doctor consultation and medicine delivery without stepping a foot out of house can be addictive and relieving. Online medical records and follow ups have also proven to be prominent in building trust in online players. The digitization in this sector will bring in the transparency, accessibility, and accountability, which a patient really needs. With a slight nudge from the government like issuance of telemedicine guidelines, Indian healthcare ecosystem has moved 10 years ahead in a matter of months. COVID-19 pandemic has brought an opportunity for the government and industry to revamp, adopt the digital processes and automation, and bring the much needed transparency, accessibility and accountability which a patient needs.

Harper, aged 28, of Kildare Road, Knowle West, admitted two counts of conveying prohibited items into prison and was jailed for six months, suspended for two years, curfewed for five months and ordered to attend an emotional resilience course during 20 days of rehabilitation activities.
 Judge Timothy Rose told her that people who smuggle items into jail almost always go straight to prison, but he was suspending the sentence because she is the sole carer for two young children.
 He said a 20-month delay in the case coming to court meant that she had conceived, carried and given birth to her second child in the time.
 He said:”This is a very serious offence indeed. These items have tremendous value in prison and lead to appalling problems in the prison establishment of disorder indiscipline, threats and violence.”
 Mr Paul Grumbar, prosecuting, said Harper was visiting Barnes at Channings Wood Prison near Newton Abbot on February 2, 2019, when the items were found.

It’s hard to live with your friends. Some might disagree with your opinions on household necessities, some might have a different understanding of the phrase “work ethic” than you and some might have no accounts on streaming services to contribute. They just watch _The Umbrella Academy_ on your Netflix and scramble your recommended content. Especially now, when we’re spending more time in our living spaces than ever before, it is important to establish some rules early on to avoid aggressive encounters down the road when the garbage is overflowing and the living room still smells like the fish you burnt last week.
 Some of the rules can and should be monotonous: who has what chores what week, stack your dishes in the dishwasher, don’t just leave them in the sink, no sex in the common rooms (when your roommates are home). But you can also make this process a fun one. Incorporate roommate-specific rules to single out your friends or take pity on them. If Seámus leaves the AC on again when he opens the windows, sneak into his room to turn his AC off before he goes to bed. Saves the energy he’s wasted, and the punishment of a sweaty night’s sleep is as bad as any. If Stacey puts up another tasteless painting in the common areas, write redrum in lipstick on her mirror. _The Shining_ is less terrifying than her passion for interior design. Stealing house rules from television shows or movies can also spice things up. The douchebag jar from _New Girl_ , or — copying _The Big Bang Theory_ — if one roommate develops time travel, the first place they stop is the exact moment when this rule is formed … pretty disappointing. It is important, however, not to go too overboard. You are living with your friends, afterall, not in a totalitarian regime. Reggie has to cool it with the enforcement of coasters.
 You can also turn rule making into a drinking game with your house or apartment mates. Let’s face it, these days largely the only people we’ll be drinking with are our roommates, so Friday nights need to get creative anyways, otherwise we’ll be facing a slow mental deterioration and we’ll be unintentionally recreating scenes from _The Lighthouse_. Whether it’s a subpar nightly chef or a roommate who grunts like they’re wrestling a pig during an indoor workout, we’re going to need innovative nights to differentiate the days. Take turns creating a new house rule, and if the majority veto it, take a drink.
 One thing I miss most from previous nights out at Cornell, before 38% of Americans stopped buying Corona beer (did you expect more from a country that charges you $30 to watch Mulan on top of a monthly subscription?), is the themes. Dressing up in ridiculous attire, drinking subpar drinks that barely meet the requirements of said theme and listening to loud, relevant music — I never thought I’d miss it until it was gone. One meager way to relive your former glory could be adhering to themes just within your own house. My apartment will be founding Themed Thursdays this semester, starting it off with Wild West and Wine Bags. Sangria Safari took the number two slot (there’s no point in putting in the effort if you’re not willing to alliterate). You can also do it with foods if your household isn’t big into drinking; Tacos and Tequila, oh wait.
 Just don’t throw actual events where you live, we’ve already seen small spikes from parties in college town, and are just starting to get it managed. Keep it to those that live with you or reside within your bubble. Coronavirus complicates living situations even further. Some people have already driven home because their roommates have not taken this pandemic seriously. Communication is more essential than ever to cohabitate.
 Coming out of a year of living with close friends and maintaining those relationships is all about relying on each other. The trust not to disobey social distancing, or the trust to hold their grip on you as you’re lifted to stomp on your ceiling to give the neighbors above you a taste of their own medicine. They are either holding bidaily tap dancing lessons or they are continuously purchasing build-your-own furniture from Ikea. Apartment 4A, have a little more neighborly courtesy at 8 a.m.
 To more evenly spread daily tasks, you can leave a calendar on the fridge, post-it notes on bedroom doors or a color coordinated spreadsheet shared to all with the household’s menu. Red rows for failures, green for success. The truth of the matter is that if you can endure a month without your final roommate in Ithaca — the one that brings up the TV, toaster, printer and Playstation – then you can probably endure the semester. You survived on four forks and one pan for the month of August. Discovery Channel should give you a survival show, pitch it as a more realistic _Man vs. Wild._

Calling in to Fox News on Tuesday, Trump said, “You look at countries, Austria, you look at so many countries. They live in the forest, they’re considered forest cities. So many of them. And they don’t have fires like this. And they have more explosive trees.”
 In an article Thursday for the London-based Independent, Austria's agriculture minister sought to set the record straight.
 “There have been both serious and humorous conversations on social media about the ‘exploding trees’ (Trump) mentioned, as well as the fact that he claimed we live within ‘forest cities’ which never catch fire,” Elisabeth Koestinger wrote. “As Austrians, fortunately blessed with a healthy sense of humour, we normally take such clichés about our country in our stride.”

John Ely, county attorney for Pitkin County and that county’s representative on the district board, voted against putting it on the ballot because of concerns that it lacked specific commitments about where the revenues generated would go, even as it would be spent by a district board not directly accountable to taxpayers but instead appointed by county commissioners.
 “Quite frankly I was looking for a way to support it,” Ely told Pitkin commissioners this week.
 He wasn’t able to persuade fellow board members to revise the ballot language.
 While the district has a plan for using the money, Mueller had advised the board against tying the hands of future district boards through ballot- language spending commitments, given the unpredictability of what the future may hold. He also had contended a shorter ballot proposal was more likely to pass than a longer one.

JANET ELIZABETH CONOVER (Grant) July 20, 1927 - September 6, 2020 Heaven has a new angel and she's from New York City. Janet Conover passed peacefully away on September 6, 2020 at her home at The Dunfield Residence, and began organizing in heaven immediately. Born in Bayside, Queens, New York, Janet was the daughter of Charles Grant (a composer and arranger for Irving Berlin) and Martha Grant, a nurse. She is predeceased by her sister, Carol Grant (a watercolorist in The American Museum of Watercolors). On Janet's mother's side was Norwegian blood and she showed a tough, adventurous nature. It was her Viking side. Her father died of a heart attack when she was only 10 years old and she had to help take care of her younger sister. Janet went to Bayside High, and graduated from NYU in Marketing. Her first job was as a copywriter for Vogue magazine. It didn't pay - but boy was it glamorous. Fulfilling her Viking nature to explore, she took a cruise to Europe at age 27 on the Andrea Doria, where she met a young Canadian, Hugh Conover on board. Romance ensued and they travelled Europe together. Janet married her soulmate, Hugh in 1954. They had 3 children, Steve (Joanie d. 2010) (Diana), Scott (Karen) and Lisa. Then she went back to work. She restarted her work life first as a volunteer on the AGO Junior Women's Committee. While at the Ago, she and Barbara Clarke organized the first- ever fund raising lottery for the gallery. Her first paying gig was as manager for Jack Pollack's art gallery in the TD Centre. Then came her true calling - PR. She joined Arts and Communications, the first public relations company in Canada to pair corporations with arts groups. During her 35-year career with ACC she helped bring the King Tut exhibit to Canada, introduced the country to Maud Lewis and escorted the likes of Paloma Picasso and Henry Kissinger around Toronto. She never really hung up her PR boots and was still helping clients into her 90's. Janet had 10 wonderful grandchildren who she adored (and they adored her right back) Shem, Samantha, Elisha, Stephanie, Nate, Evan, Grant, Jesse, Hannah and Jason. And 4 great- grans - Iylah, Iyabo, Irie and Isis-Imani. Her lovely Hugh died in 2017 and she missed him terribly. We are comforted they are now reunited. We plan to hold a Celebration of Life in the Spring.

In 2016, Trump won that district that includes the Democratic city of Duluth by 15 percentage points. But in the midterms two years later, Radinovich lost by just under 6 percentage points.
 Still, Trump has spent more than a year building a sizable Minnesota ground game. Republicans are out knocking on doors and interacting personally with voters in ways that Democrats mostly have not, preferring online operations amid the coronavirus.
 The president’s reelection campaign announced this week a $10 million ad buy in a series of states, including Minnesota. It has spent nearly $17 million on advertising in the state since last October, compared to almost $6.3 million for Biden over the same period, according to a review of Kantar/CMAG data by The Associated Press.
 Democrats warn that Biden still may have his work cut out for him. Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said the Trump campaign has far outpaced Biden in local yard signs — which indicates enthusiasm but may not ultimately affect the outcome.
 "One of the things the Trump campaign has been very good about is visibility in Duluth, but also in areas around Duluth,” Larson said.
 Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said that while Biden isn’t likely to carry the congressional district that includes Duluth, he might be able to pick up enough support there to deny Trump the votes he needs to win statewide.
 “If your opponent is on the ropes or on the ground, you don’t get up,” Martin said.

“We agree with the division in _Burleigh_ that charitable contributions may be imposed as a condition of probation if the district court makes findings to support the proposition that, in a defendant’s particular case, the contribution serves the purposes of probation,” wrote Judge Gilbert M. Román in Greenlee’s case. “[H]owever, we see no factual findings of this nature in the record.”
 Román elaborated that Kolomitz had apparently not determined specifically whether the donation was reasonably related to Greenlee’s rehabilitation or probation, or even whether he had the ability to pay. Nor did the stipulation about the lack of tax-deductibility seem founded.
 The appellate judges ordered the trial court to reevaluate the donation directive in light of those questions.
 Mark E. Biddison, Greenlee's attorney, said that charitable contributions are not a statutory condition of probation, and that he believed the $1 million amount was “strictly punitive in nature.” Greenlee has not made any contributions while the case was on appeal.
 “The trial court initially did not establish a factual nexus between the incident and the need to make specific charitable contributions,” added Biddison. “Or how it would encourage Mr. Greenlee to be more law-abiding."
 Robert S. Willett, the district attorney for the 12th Judicial District, said on Thursday afternoon that he would need to look at the ruling in depth and determine how to proceed.
 The case is _People v. Greenlee._

 However, opposition to the measure also emerged this week from Pitkin County commissioners, after their representative on the district board also was the only board member to have voted against the tax proposal. And while some other counties in the district have been formally endorsing the measure, so far there’s no indication that Mesa County commissioners will follow suit.
 Pitkin County traditionally has been one of the largest sources of tax revenues within the 15-county district because of its high property values. As for Mesa County, it has by far the largest population and largest number of voters that will help decide the fate of the proposal.
