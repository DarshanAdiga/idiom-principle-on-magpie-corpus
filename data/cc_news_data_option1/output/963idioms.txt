"It's still a long way to go. We want to go game by game," Arteta said. "Three weeks ago, it was impossible [to secure Champions League qualification]. Now, it looks a bit more possible."

“In the U.S., many municipalities are banning the use of facial recognition software like this,” he said. “The Liberal government should follow suit, at least until we know for a fact that no laws in Canada have been breached.”

“That’s what I want to hear,” Williams said. “I want us to be a physical, aggressive team.”
 “We’re much more aggressive (than we were),” Williams said. “We’re going to be aggressive tomorrow night. We’re going to play our ball, and if we happen to get beat, we happen to get beat.
 “But I’ve told (the team), I would much rather get beat (after) fighting hard than just rolling over and not playing. We’re going to play hard.”
 The Tigers are one game from states, but remain disappointed about Friday’s outcome in Beckley.
 “We gave the Woodrow game away,” Williams said. “We led the whole game, and at the end we weren’t hitting, the last couple of minutes, we didn’t hit shots. But we had great looks. It wasn’t anything that they (Woodrow Wilson) did, or any mistakes we made.
 “I mean, for many years … we just made silly mistakes at the end of games. We didn’t do any of those things. We did everything right, except make the shots.
 “Not to say that Woodrow’s not a good team. They certainly are; I’m not taking anything away from them. But they know, and we know, that we had that one to win.”
 Junior Delathan Wilborn scored 30 points and senior Peyton Brown chipped in 14 against the Flying Eagles on Friday.
 Princeton lost four starters from last spring’s squad, and Williams said, “At the first of the year, no one thought we would be any good. That’s just the facts.”
 “These guys have really worked hard. Once they realized that it’s a team thing, and not one or two guys can do it alone against a good team … Once they realized that they’ve got to rely on the other guys, man, they’ve been exceptional.”
 The seniors on his team have been the heart and soul of the Tigers.
 “Their attitudes have been great. I’m certainly going to miss them,” Williams said. “I didn’t expect this much from them. They’ve surpassed what I thought they would do.”
 Whether his squad wins or loses tonight, the coach said, “For them to come out and do what they’ve done so far, I couldn’t be prouder. I think, again, they have their eyes on the right prize.
 “They’re not in awe. We’re going up there to win. We expect to win, just like we did at Woodrow. And the good Lord willin’, we’ll pull one off.”
