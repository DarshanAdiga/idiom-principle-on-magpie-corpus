ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — An Alaska airline forced to file for bankruptcy because of a severe drop in business following the coronavirus outbreak is set to return passengers to the air. Ravn Alaska is scheduled to begin operating flights to six Alaska communities Friday and resume regularly scheduled public chartered flights. Ravn Alaska CEO Rob McKinney said tickets are available for flights between Anchorage and Unalaska, Sand Point, Homer, Kenai and Valdez. RavnAir Group was previously the largest rural carrier in Alaska, employing more than 1,300 people and serving more than 100 communities across the state. The company halted operations in April, laid off staff and filed for bankruptcy because of the economic impact of the coronavirus. The company operated more than 400 flights daily with a fleet of 72 aircraft, but passenger traffic decreased more than 90% after the outbreak of the pandemic. The company is now under new ownership and management. McKinney, a pilot with experience flying in Alaska, was part of a group that acquired some of RavnAir Group’s assets in August for $9.5 million, including several de Havilland Dash-8-100 aircraft. McKinney also helped launch FLOAT Shuttle, a Southern California air taxi that purchased the RavnAir assets. Ravn Alaska has rehired more than 300 employees for the relaunch, the company said in a statement. “There are a lot of familiar faces back at Ravn and we’re proud to rehire this crew and provide jobs to so many Alaskans that are experts in their field,” McKinney said in the statement. “They know the routes, the passengers and community needs that are critical in making the airline responsive, dependable and safe.” The public chartered flights will be limited to four round-trips per week between Anchorage...

In Brazil, collective or shared candidacies and mandates have been around in some form since the mid-1990s. They can range from a handful of members who know each other and share the physical space of an office, to hundreds of participants debating and voting on legislative proposals online, as suggested by internet-based efforts in Sweden and Argentina to hold representatives more accountable to the population. But it wasn’t until the last decade that such experiments started to gain traction in the Brazil, reaching a peak between 2016 and 2018, when 98 groups ran and 22 were elected for legislative seats on the local, state, and federal levels, according to a 2019 study led by Secchi and the nonpartisan organization Political Action Network for Sustainability. Overall, group candidacies have obtained more than 1.2 million votes across 17 states in past elections.

Dean Klempke, a real estate agent at Iron Gate Real Estate in Columbia, recommends that people interested in buying new construction homes should do so now because prices may rise another $5,000 to $10,000 next year.
 Buyers may also pay lower prices by purchasing inventory homes, Wannstedt said. These are houses that started earlier this summer and are sold now reflecting the prices builders paid for lumber and other materials then. Buyers of those homes may have to sacrifice choosing amenities such as countertop material or flooring, but they also can save a few thousand dollars.
 Eiffert expects prices of lumber to continue to fall and stay at moderate levels for the rest of the year. Although prices have been falling at historic rates after hitting record highs, he doubts they will reach record lows.
 “If things get fairly inexpensive after what we’ve lived through this summer, I think people are going to be willing to step in fairly aggressively and have more inventory on the shelf just as a protective measure,” Eiffert said.

The peaceful transition of power is when democracies prove themselves. Now, reflect on the fact that President Trump declared before Election Day -- in no uncertain terms -- that the only outcome he would accept is victory. Let that sink in for a minute.
   
 He publicly made his path to a second term abundantly clear leading up to the election. Swamp the courts with enough lawsuits to find some legal something (he has no idea what it is right now) that could land the contest in the Supreme Court, where his newly appointed majority would usher him in. That, by the way, is not being elected.
   
 If anyone knows the tool of filing lawsuits to get what they want, it is Donald Trump. He launched over 3,500 lawsuits through his business dealings before 2016. Most recently, on Tuesday, Trump filed a suit in federal court against Michigan, a state that he lost by 146,000 votes, to stop it from certifying its election.
   
 It is one thing to request a Georgia recount, it is another to lie about winning, and feed conspiracy theories that further divide the nation and corrode what's left of our democratic institutions.
   
 Remember, counting votes is not stealing an election, it literally is an election.
   
 The transition of power is when democracies prove themselves, and the person in the White House appears to be the first president who never intended to let go of power at all.

De altfel, aceste reflecții ale mele mai, pardon, filozofice nu au apărut pe loc gol, dar se datorează răsfoirii unei cărți semnate de scriitorul și omul de afaceri Virgil Profeanu, care și-a permis o altă abordare, decât cea tradițională, asupra cuvântului plămădit de strămoșii noștri latini și romani. Ba mai mult, cum îi stă bine unui afacerist de succes, domnul Profeanu consideră că orice cuvânt, darămite un ditamai proverb, ar fi bine să fie aplicabil și în management, iar faptul că politica în Republica Moldova a devenit o afacere mi se pare incontestabil. Așadar, în opinia domniei sale, vrabia — pasăre mică ce ne încântă de fiecare dată cu penele sale frumoase şi colorate şi cu ciripitul său minunat apare, în acest proverb, în antiteză cu cioara — pasăre mare, cu penaj negru, ce ne înfricoşează de multe ori cu croncănitul său. Or, cine este vrabia și cine este cioara (cine este porumbelul și cine este coțofana) în această campanie prezidențială vă las pe Dvs. să decideți, deși răspunsul este la suprafață și nu cred că multă lume nu și-a dat seama cine „ciripește” și cine „croncănește”.

EL DIA que un comando armado secuestró y ejecutó a la alcaldesa de Jamapa, Florisel Ríos Delfín al salir de su domicilio –el miércoles por la mañana-, hubo otros cuatro asesinatos de mujeres en diferentes partes de la Entidad y una lesionada de bala que lucha por su vida, lo que confirma que Veracruz es el Estado más peligrosos para las féminas, tal como lo definen las cifras de feminicidios y homicidios dolosos que registra el Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad, en tanto el disco rayado del Gobernador Cuitláhuac García Jiménez insiste en que este crimen no quedara impune (como han quedado el 99.9 por ciento de los ocurridos durante su administración), y para colmo jura que después de lo ocurrido “se acabó la impunidad”, mientras que el Presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, en aras de justificarlo (pues no es poca monta los subejercicios en que incurre el Estado que le permiten usar a discreción recursos del presupuesto local en sus programas sociales clientelares), tras lamentar el crimen de la alcaldesa de Jamapa se concretó a decir que “se está investigando” para enseguida insistir en un tema por demás trillado y chocante, como si a alguien le importara que, “en el caso de Veracruz, mis paisanos ahora cuentan con un Gobernador honesto, Cuitláhuac García; hacía mucho tiempo que esto no pasaba en Veracruz, no estoy diciendo que es un santo, que es perfecto, pero no tengo duda que es gente honesta y eso es muy importante, porque siempre se ha padecido de gobernadores mediocres (¿?) y ladrones, entonces si es un cambio importante”, lo que pone en evidencia que el Presidente juega con la inteligencia de los veracruzanos y hasta se pitorrea valiéndole la desgracia ajena, que como decía José de Espronceda en su Canto a Teresa: “Truéquese en risa mi dolor profundo…Que haya un cadáver más ¿qué importa al mundo?”.

“Leggendo le motivazioni con cui la Corte sportiva d’Appello ha respinto il ricorso presentato dal Napoli – ha detto Cesari a Radio Crc – credo che ci siano poche possibilità di ribaltare il verdetto. Non mi sono piaciuti i termini utilizzati da Sandulli. Credo però che abbiano fatto parte di un messaggio spedito a tutti le società di Serie A, alle quali è stato consigliato di non eludere il protocollo”. Per quanto riguarda, invece, il primo bilancio sull’utilizzo del Var nella quarta stagione di seguito in Serie A, Cesari ha suggerito di inserire alcune novità. “Mi piacerebbe che a chiamare il Var fossero pure gli allenatori – ha detto Cesari – inoltre in sala Var prevederei la presenza di ex calciatori. Commentando gli episodi di moviola in tv, mi sono accorto che la percezione degli ex atleti è diversa e serve a completare il giudizio prima di prendere una decisione”. Per quanto riguarda gli episodi che hanno visto protagonista il Napoli, Cesari ha ricordato che “la trattenuta su Lozano a Benevento era punibile con il calcio di rigore. Peccato che il Var non abbia sottoposto il caso all’attenzione dell’arbitro. A Bologna c’era rigore su Osimhen, però il Var ha fornito a Pasqua una sequenza di immagini incompleta. Così l’arbitro non ha potuto decidere al meglio”.

It's that season! Yes, it's the holiday season, but it's also the "how do I get rid of the turkey leftovers" season. The recipes I'm sharing today are Chez Lolly-approved by family and friends.      LITTLE GOBBLER CROISSANT SANDWICHES   One of my social media friends told me about a sandwich that her mama served their family after Thanksgiving. It sounded amazing to me, and I decided to try it out for our family. We all love it!      • Croissants (cut in half lengthwise)   • Cream cheese (I used the whipped version so it will be easy to spread)   • Sliced turkey   • Cranberry sauce      Spread a liberal serving of cream cheese on each half of the croissant.      Pile on the turkey slices and then spoon over as much or little cranberry sauce as you'd like. Top with that other half of the croissant. Refrigerate until ready to serve.      TURKEY AND SAUSAGE GUMBO   It's a tradition in our family to have gumbo on hand for the busy weekend following Thanksgiving. Have all the ingredients prepared and ready to go. Once the roux is ready, you'll add all the veggies at one time.   • 12 to 14 cups turkey stock (preferably homemade)   • 1 cup flour   • 1 cup vegetable oil   • 1 large yellow onion, chopped   • 3 ribs celery, chopped   • 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and chopped   • 2 teaspoons chopped garlic   • 16 ounces package Cajun-style smoked sausage, diced and browned   • 2 to 3 cups chopped turkey   • 1 to 2 tablespoons Cajun or Creole seasoning   • 2 bay leaves   • Cooked white rice   • Chopped parsley   • Thinly sliced green onions      In a large Dutch oven (7 quarts), bring turkey stock to a gentle simmer.      In a large cast-iron skillet, add the flour and oil. Turn heat to medium high and, continually stirring, begin to make the roux. You must stir the mixture constantly so it won't burn.      When the roux reaches the color of peanut butter, add the onions, celery and bell pepper all at once and stir. The vegetables will cool the roux so that it stops cooking, and the heat from the roux will soften the veggies.      Lower the heat to medium low and let the vegetables cook for 4 to 5 minutes, frequently stirring. Add the garlic and let cook another minute or so.      Add the vegetables to the simmering stock. Next, add in the browned sausage and turkey. Stir in the Creole seasoning and add the bay leaves.   Bring the gumbo up to a gentle simmer and let cook for an hour or so. Remove the bay leaves before serving over cooked rice. Garnish with parsley and/or green onions.      CREAMY TURKEY AND WILD RICE SOUP   This recipe, courtesy of Food and Wine, was adapted from a chicken and wild rice recipe into a turkey and wild rice recipe.      • 4 tablespoons unsalted butter   • 2 carrots, cut into inch pieces   • 3 celery ribs, cut into inch pieces   • 1 medium onion, chopped   • 2 garlic cloves, minced   • 1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme   • Salt   • Pepper   • 1/4 cup all-purpose flour   • 1 cup wild rice (5 ounces)   • 2 quarts chicken stock or low-sodium broth   • 2 cups of water   • 4 cups bite-size pieces of roasted turkey (or chicken)   • 1 cup heavy cream   • Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish      Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, thyme and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Cook over moderate heat, occasionally stirring, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes.      Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and cook, stirring, until evenly coated and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the wild rice to the saucepan and gradually stir in the stock and water.      Bring to a boil, then simmer over moderately low heat, occasionally stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.      Add the turkey (or chicken) and simmer, occasionally stirring, until the wild rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with fresh chopped parsley and serve.

Operating in this gray area also leaves room for outside interference.

In October, five co-deputies in the northeastern state of Pernambuco of the feminist mandate Juntas (“together”) issued a manifesto condemning the decisions as retaliation against a method that has been validated by popular demand.
