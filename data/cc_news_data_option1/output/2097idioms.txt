The State Medical Board of Ohio is encouraging anyone who feels they were harmed by a local doctor accused of raping a child to come forward.
   
 Dr. Joseph Cook, 53, of Ben Fulton Road NW in North Lawrence area, was arrested last week at his home by U.S. Marshals Violent Fugitive Task Force agents and Stark County sheriff's deputies on warrants charging him with rape and gross sexual imposition, Stark County Jail records show.
   
 The charges stem from allegations that he had sexual contact with an 11-year- old girl on Dec. 26.
   
 Sheriff's Sgt. Craig Kennedy said the case against Cook "has nothing to do with him being a doctor and nothing to do with his practice."
   
 The state medical board is aware of the allegations.
   
 Tessie Pollock, chief communications officer for the board, said Thursday that "the board remains in contact with local authorities, including the county prosecutor and sheriff's office, regarding this situation."
   
 Cook is a doctor of osteopathic medicine licensed by the Medical Board to practice family medicine. His license was issued July 25, 2008, and is valid through until April 1, 2021. His status remained active as Wednesday afternoon.
   
 Pollock said she could neither confirm nor deny that the board is investigating.
   
 "As the Medical Board has jurisdiction to investigate our licensees, the board encourages anyone who feels they were harmed by Dr. Cook to please contact our investigators confidentially by calling the State Medical Board of Ohio complaint hotline at 1-833-333-SMBO (7626) or online at med.ohio.gov," she said.
   
 Cook remained behind bars Thursday, held in lieu of $500,000 bond pending court hearings.

Primary and secondary schools will reopen at the beginning of the academic year at the end of August, the Taoiseach has confirmed. Speaking at a press conference this afternoon at government buildings after today&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that Education Minister Joe McHugh presented a memo which stated that the government will go ahead with reopening schools at the end of the summer.&quot;He confirmed that it is the intention of government to reopen our primary and secondary schools at the start of the school year. The start of the school year as you know begins at the end of August, not September, so it is intended to reopen primary schools and secondary schools at the end of August at the normal time that the academic year begins,&quot; he said.He said that research is underway to ensure &quot;low risk&quot; in reopening schools.&quot;They&rsquo;re making good progress particularly paying attention to new and emerging research on the level of risk of the schools reopening and as the research continues to come in, it is not a &lsquo;no risk&rsquo; scenario but it is a low risk scenario,&quot; he said.He added that it may mean that not all children may be able to go to school every day of the week, but that this is the end goal.&quot;In addition to that our learning very much from the experience of other countries who have opened schools at least partially already.&quot;He said that 'play pods' for young children, where it is &quot;not possible&quot; to social distance, would keep children safe.However, he rebutted claims that the 2m social distancing guideline would be changed in schools.&quot;It's too soon for that, the virus would need to be suppressed much more in the community,&quot; he added.The Taoiseach also said that the country is &quot;on track&quot; to proceed with phase two of our planned route out of lockdown.&quot;We are on track to move to phase two as intended on Monday, June 8,&quot; he said.

After 40 years in business, Dave Traphagen had found his niche and believed he was immune to economic downturns.
   
 Trap's Sports Center, a sporting equipment supplier in Alliance, had managed through the Great Recession without serious problems. As a supplier to area high schools and local sports leagues, Traphagen's customer base always had a need.
   
 The coronavirus pandemic hit Traphagen's business during its strongest seasons -- baseball and softball. Schools closed and youth leagues shutdown. His customers didn't need shirts or balls for games that weren't being played.
   
 "I never in my life dreamed something like this would happen," Traphagen said.
   
 Thousands of businesses -- including Trap's Sports Center -- around Ohio closed in March and remained shuttered for seven weeks. As a result retail sales in the United States dropped more than 16% in April, as a result of government stay-at-home orders and fears of possible infection.
   
 Nearly every retail segment saw sales drop during April. Clothing sales plummeted 79%, while sales of electronics and appliances dropped 61%, furniture dropped 59% and specialty store sales fell 38%.
   
 Observers hope April proves to be the worst month for retail sales and that consumer spending rebounds, as most states begin to lift restrictions and reopen businesses.
   
 "But what matters is the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic and whether consumers feel comfortable going out in public," PNC Financial Services Group Chief Economist Gus Faucher said in a prepared statement. "Also, businesses continue to lay off millions of workers a week. If layoffs do not abate, and the job market deteriorates further in the near term, sentiment could again fall in the near term."
   
 Reopening, however, means retailers will have to deal with changes aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus. Employees are wearing masks and gloves, tracking the number of customers entering stores, and wiping down fixtures with disinfectant.
   
 Retailers deemed essential and allowed to remain open during the shutdown had a head start on adjusting.
   
 Lucas Staten, retail manager for Mohler Lumber & Building Materials in Jackson Township, said the changes were challenging.
   
 "Sometimes we found ourselves doing things on the fly," he said.
   
 While the store remained open, it has reduced hours. Nightly cleaning has been expanded to include disinfecting.
   
 "We're doing all we can to stay safe," Staten said.
   
 Holleydale Farms in Jackson Township had more issues with the weather than with coronavirus, said Rita Oser, the business owner. She had to cancel an annual spring open house because it would have been too difficult to meet social distancing requirements.
   
 More shoppers are seeking vegetables for gardens this year, Oser said, adding that concerns about food being available in grocery stores seems to be driving the demand.
   
 "A lot of these people are gardening for the first time," she said. "You can tell they never had a garden before."
   
 Mulch, soil, stone and other landscaping products were in high demand at Mohler, Staten said. Paint also proved to be a popular item as customers furloughed from their jobs found projects to keep themselves busy.
   
 Mohler saw more customers than usual during the shutdown and Staten suspects it's because the business was among the few retailers allowed to remain open. As more retailers reopen and shoppers have a broader range of choices, Staten expects things will calm down.
   
 It's been a slow start for Trap's Sports Center since reopening on May 12. But 40 years in business has prepared Traphagen for the unexpected.
   
 "I would hate for someone who just started in business to experience this," he said.
   
 Ohio has cleared the resumption of non-contact sports, which means baseball and softball travel leagues can resume in June. That has brought back some customers. But fall sports remain up in the air and Traphagen doesn't expect answers will be coming soon.

The moment Gov. Mike DeWine permanently closed Ohio schools for the 2019-20 academic year, Jacob Hervey recruited others to create a positive farewell message for fellow Class of 2020 members.
   
 Hervey, a graduating senior at Perry High School and its class president, organized a video project involving class presidents from eight other Stark County area high schools.
   
 The participating schools were Perry, Jackson, Massillon, McKinley, GlenOak, Hoover, Louisville, Green and Central Catholic. "I tried to reach out to as many schools in the area as I could," Hervey said.
   
 Each participant wore school gear or cap and gown, recorded a line or two - many outside their respective school - and sent their video clips to Hervey who edited them into a singular, meaningful message.
   
 Hervey said the message is "meant for every single" member of the Class of 2020 in the Stark County area.
   
 How their senior year, he said, was "disappointing" but it should not define the last 12 years.
   
 "Yes, we're all upset now but don't forget all the years of laughs, memories and joy," said Hervey, also founder of the nonprofit Books Behind Bars, who plans to study pre-law at Duke University.

She's one of the biggest pop stars of the decade, and still, after all the chart-toppers and accolades, Lady Gaga feels most comfortable behind a mask.
 From the egocentric pop parody that we first met on 2009's _The Fame_ to the male persona she trotted out on stage during her _Born This Way_ era (whose name, for those keeping score, was Jo Calderone) to the unsuccessful everygirl heartland reinvention she attempted on 2016's much-maligned _Joanne_ to the actually-successful everygirl heartland reinvention she pulled off with 2018's Academy Award-winning drama film _A Star Is Born_, one can feel that despite her celebrity status and fairly constant radio presence, no one really knows who the real Lady Gaga is. Fans will write glowing overviews of critically wronged records, she'll perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show to an audience of millions, and she'll reveal her medical struggles in a widely-seen Netflix documentary, but at the end of the day, "Lady Gaga" feels less like a human and more of a construction, faceted together with glitter, club lights, and pure good-old-fashioned talent.
 Yet Gaga was always smarter than her dance-pop contemporaries. In crafting these ever-shifting, sometimes outrageous public personas, she was able to grab all the attention and absorb all the flak in equal measure, even netting a Top Five hit in the US with a song that contains the line, "One second I'm a Koons / Then suddenly the Koons is me." She understood that pop music was designed to be ridiculous, or at the very least, was memorable when it was at its most absurd and campy. There were pieces of her real feelings and beliefs in every outrageous outfit and curious side project. Despite bearing parts of her inner life throughout _Joanne_ , Gaga still felt most comfortable in keeping her listeners at an emotional arms' length away.
 All of this makes _Chromatica_ , her sixth studio full-length proper, such an utterly dynamic record unlike anything else in her discography. On the surface, it is a concept-free, back-the-basics dance album that is meant to be played straight through without interruption, modeling itself somewhat like Madonna's late-era masterwork _Confessions on the Dancefloor_ from 2005. With only one song tipping past the four-minute mark, she blazes through 16 tracks in all of 43 minutes, making for a ballad-free listen that is at times both relentless and revealing.

To their credit, surveying this new box-set in its entirety, it's remarkable how rarely Buzzcocks make an outright misstep — though obviously consistency comes with its own challenges. I will say that "Phone" is one of the few songs anywhere across these eight discs that makes my teeth grate. The Casio pre-set beat isn't the issue; it's the cheesy guitar parts and lyrical delivery that give it an unflattering touch of cod-reggae. The pre-set that does pose problems at certain times on _Modern_ is Shelley's falling back into the same whimsical unlucky in love character that was winning in his early 20s but can wear thin at age 44. On "Thunder of Hearts" or "Under the Sun", his knack for a specific image that captures a universal feeling goes a bit astray. Instrumentally, while either would have been a serviceable diversion on _Trade Test Transmissions_ , amid the changed-up quality of songs on _Modern_ they sound too much like Buzzcocks-by-the-numbers.
 That minor gripe, and the skippable "Phone", don't detract significantly from _Modern_. It's Buzzcocks' best post-'70s album. For the first time since their return, they sounded like they were doing something entirely their own and didn't give a hoot what else was going on. The album title serves as a mission statement given this album sounds like a modernization of an effective formula. At the same time, however, it also reads like a tongue-in-cheek joke, given the sounds blended into the mix rest on '80s-sounding electronic effects. It's a genuinely clever approach because the retro-vibe feels novel, it steers clear of some underfunded _OK Computer_ -lite direction, and it leads to a sound that the band can truly own. Shelley had released an album in 1983 that came with a program for a ZX Spectrum computer and, in some ways, _Modern_ feels like Buzzcocks' fulfillment of that direction.
  _Note: The numerical rating pertains to the individual album under review and not the full set._

On the gameplay side, players who crave strategy will want more and more strategy. In many ways in this genre, mobile is playing catch up with PC games. When you look at something like the original Warcraft, or even games that preceded it, the gameplay there already delivered what's only now at the cutting edge of the actual strategic gameplay on mobile. Specifically, unrestricted troop movement and real-time battles only came in 2018, over 20 years after Warcraft. On the technical front these are much more challenging to deliver in a massively multiplayer online game, so it's no wonder it's taken awhile to get here, but as developers continue to push on to try to deliver the next top grossing hit, these elements will continue to find ways to mobile.

The deal for a Michigan-based health system to acquire Summa Health is off.
   
 In a joint statement this morning, Southfield, Mich.-based Beaumont Health said it was ending its proposed partnership with Akron-based Summa.
   
 The deal, which began last year with a letter of intent and a definitive agreement in December, has already received all necessary state and federal regulatory approvals.
   
 Combined, the two organizations would have been a $6.1 billion nonprofit organization in annual revenue with 45,000 employees in two states and more than 6.000 affiliated physicians.
   
 But in April, amidst the coronavirus pandemic, both hospitals said they were putting the brakes on the deal.
   
 "Both Summa and Beaumont are all hands on deck with the COVID-19 crisis," Beaumont's CEO John T. Fox said at the time. "So we didn't plan this, but we are deferring that until we have a little more clarity about the impact of the crisis."
   
 The COVID pandemic has caused major financial losses for hospitals nationwide as the virus and protections put in place to limit the spread, including prohibiting elective surgeries and procedures during the height of the shelter-in-place orders took a toll on hospital pocketbooks.
   
 In a brief joint statement Friday morning, both health systems said: "Beaumont Health is ending partnership plans with Akron, Ohio, based Summa Health. The two organizations had been working over the last year to create a partnership, signed a definitive agreement in December 2019 and later received all necessary state and federal regulatory approvals. The organizations are now finalizing details and next steps to end the planned partnership.
   
 "Throughout this process, each of the organizations has continued to operate independently, and each will continue to focus on providing exceptional health care services for their respective markets.
   
 "Both Beaumont Health and Summa Health value the support that each organization has received from their employees, physicians and communities throughout this process and will continue to work to meet their needs moving forward."
   
 Summa President and CEO Dr. Cliff Deveny is scheduled to speak to the Beacon Journal for further comment this morning.
   
 The deal for Summa to become a wholly-owned subsidiary under Beaumont came last year after the Akron-based healthcare system said it was putting itself on the market in October 2018 to boost patient services, improve finances and thwart competition.
   
 Summa said it was looking for a potential partner or opportunity to help Summa grow while maintaining local control. Deveny said Summa wanted to pursue a deal to potential become "fully integrated" with a bigger health system to get all the benefits of access to capital, help with physician recruitment and the ability to add more patient services.
   
 That's what the Beaumont deal would have brought.
   
 Summa's health system includes its hospitals, Akron City, Barberton and St. Thomas, SummaCare insurance, stand-alone emergency departments and outpatient and physician offices.
   
 Summa leadership said it was not interested in parceling out parts of its health system and it would be an "all or nothing deal."
   
 In the Beaumont deal, no money would exchange hands, but Beaumont was to have paid off the minority ownership of Mercy, the former Catholic Health Partners, which merged with Bon Secours and wanted to go in a different direction.
   
 At the time of the Beaumont original announcement, industry experts were surprised by the choice of Beaumont, but said an out-of-state larger health care system brought positives. They also credited Deveny with righting Summa's financial ship. The Akron native started his career at Summa and returned in 2017 right after a crisis that saw the ouster of its former CEO after physicians voted no confidence in him following the loss of the emergency medicine residency program and a financial freefall as physicians and patients walked away from the hospital system.
   
 In the Beaumont deal, Summa Health would have maintained local leadership, including a local board and Deveny. The Summa name also was also to have stayed.

Chinese lawmakers approved a proposal for sweeping new national security legislation in Hong Kong, defying a threat by President Donald Trump to respond strongly to a measure that democracy advocates say will curb essential freedoms in the city.
 The National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp legislature, approved the draft decision by a vote of 2,878-1 on Thursday at its annual session in Beijing, with six abstentions. Chinese officials could now take months to sort out the details of laws banning subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign interference before they're given to Hong Kong's Beijing-backed administration to promulgate.
 The move to bypass the semi-autonomous city's local Legislative Council has alarmed Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists and opposition politicians. It risks spawning yet more protests in the city and could potentially prompt companies to flee if the laws undermine the independent judiciary in the Asian financial hub.
 Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said shortly after the decision that the "one country, two systems" policy governing relations with the city would remain in place.
 "The central government has all along fully and faithfully implemented" the system, he said at a briefing in Beijing at the end of the legislative session. The decision on national security laws would help "Hong Kong's long- term stability and prosperity," he added.
 The Trump administration on Wednesday took the significant step of saying it could no longer certify Hong Kong's autonomy from China, which was promised before the British handed the city back in 1997. The move could trigger a range of actions by the Trump administration, from sanctions on Chinese officials to revoking the city's special trading status with the U.S.
 Trump, asked about the possible sanctions, said Tuesday his administration was "doing something now" that he would unveil this week.
 "Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997," Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in announcing the decision. "No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground."
 Other governments also expressed worries about the legislation. Japan said it was "seriously concerned" by the move, while Taiwan said it would release a plan to help Hong Kong residents if they wanted to leave the city.
 The plan to enact the national security legislation was first announced in Beijing late last week, with Chinese officials saying it was needed to stem sometimes-violent protests that hit the city last year. They argued that Hong Kong's lawmakers had 23 years to pass the legislation, which is mandated under Hong Kong's mini-constitution called the Basic Law.
 Hong Kong's main Hang Seng Index fell as much as 2.2% before closing 0.7% lower on Thursday.
 Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who defended the legislation earlier this week, said in a statement Thursday that she welcomed the NPC's approval.
 "It will not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents," she said. "'One Country, Two Systems' has been Hong Kong's top advantage, and a stable and safe society will provide a favorable business and investment environment. This will help better Hong Kong's development down the road. I strongly believe that various sectors of society will lend their full support for the legislation."
 Hong Kong's democracy camp isn't convinced, however. While last year's protests all but stopped during the pandemic, demonstrators came out multiple times since the announcement on the laws, defying police who are still limiting public gatherings. Some of them chanted for independence, a clear red line that Beijing has used to justify passing the laws.
 Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong media tycoon and prominent pro-democracy activist, said the laws could push business away and eventually turn anyone who participates in a demonstration into a criminal.
 "It's like a knife on top of our head," Lai told Bloomberg Television. "Anytime it will come to our neck."

The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted our community. Gov. Doug Ducey asked us to “Stay Home, Stay Healthy, Stay Connected” on March 30. Santa Cruz County listened, and as a result, our infection rate was one of the lowest in the state.
 However, the new reality in Santa Cruz County is that since Mother’s Day our infection rate has more than quadrupled. As of 5 p.m. on Wednesday, we have had 239 cases confirmed in Santa Cruz County with 159 active. And it will continue to climb if we do not continue to practice what the Centers for Disease Control has been telling us all along: wear a mask, wash your hands, keep six feet apart and limit the size of your gatherings.
 Santa Cruz County has been working tirelessly to keep you safe. Our Health Department is performing contact tracing on all positive cases of COVID-19 in our county. Contact tracing is an interview of the patient to see who they have been in contact with and where they have been. We do this so we can ask people to quarantine themselves to help stop the spread.
 In addition, it helps the county determine if the patient was infected in Santa Cruz County or outside the county.
 Finally, a representative from the county calls each person that has been infected at least every other day, if not daily, to check in on them until they have recovered.
 We have all seen a lot of information from the State of Arizona, the federal government and other sources. To help sort through that, the Governor’s Office has held a conference call twice a week to field questions from county supervisors, mayors and staff. Through this dialogue we have been able to ensure that local input is considered as policies and directives are being developed.
 County supervisors, mayors and staff have also been in regular contact with our federal representatives. Congressman Raul Grijalva and his staff have briefed us on current and upcoming legislation that deals with the federal response to COVID-19. Both of Arizona’s senators have hosted multiple video and telephone conference calls detailing many of the programs available to individuals and businesses from the federal government. Both senators have added tremendous amounts of information on COVID-19 on their websites and they are continuously using social media to get the information out as quickly as possible. Both have gone the extra mile for Arizona.
 For instance, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema hired additional constituent services staff to help Arizonans that are having trouble navigating both the business and personal relief. This new staff is able to assist people still waiting for their stimulus check, having issues with their unemployment benefits or having questions about the Payroll Protection Program, among various other areas. These constituent service members can be reached by email at casework@sinema.senate.gov.
 I congratulate our senators and our congressmen and congresswomen for making this pandemic and the impacts on Arizonans a true priority.

Despite the weighty title and the existence of three orchestral interludes (all co-written by the brilliant Morgan Kibby of White Sea), _Chromatica_ only aims to get you moving. While Gaga's debut back in 2009 technically strived to do the same thing, her label still forced her into collaborations and styles she wasn't the most comfortable with, making it more of a contemporary genre sampler than it was a dance record straight through. In following up her movie star breakthrough and Oscar win, Gaga could've gone self-important and serious, but instead went against expectations and made arguably the most immediate pop record of her career.
 Yet despite all the bright beats provided by producers BloodPop® and BURNS, _Chromatica_ , at times, feels like it's Gaga's most raw-nerve record despite all the throbbing bass and sparkling synths. "Rain on Me", a pulsating hard disco collaboration with Ariana Grande and already one of her all-time greatest singles, flies through its three-minute run time so quickly you barely realize it's about alcohol abuse. Its chorus repeats the phrase, "I'd rather be dry / But at least I'm alive", a sad resignation despite all the glistening wah guitar folds. On "911", she talks about ingesting an anti- psychotic medication, evoking her own _Fame Monster_ -era Eurodisco stomp. She notes how "My mood's shifting to manic places / Wish I laughed and kept the good friendships" before admitting in the chorus that "My biggest enemy is me ever since day one." Gaga is still hiding behind vocoders and numerous filtered vocal effects, but _Chromatica_ 's best moments are the ones where it feels like Gaga's real life and experiences are seeping through the gaps in the 4/4 rhythm chains.
 Although the record opens with its least memorable track (the pleasant if middling "Alice"), most of _Chromatica_ remains breezy and stupidly fun. After already having played a pop star in _A Star Is Born_ and writing dance-pop numbers that served as a commentary on the current radio market, there is no need for meta-narrative or genre inversions here. Instead, Gaga uses _Chromatica_ to explore lyrical and musical themes that, if not personal, are playful and sometimes downright absurd. The exuberant lead single "Stupid Love" struts about in DayGlo colors as it speaks of wanting love and pretty much nothing else. The Elton John duet "Sine From Above" ends in a full drum 'n' bass breakdown because why the hell _wouldn't_ you want to hear an Elton John duet end in a full drum 'n' bass breakdown? The collaboration on paper is already camp, but the production takes the concept into absolute overdrive.

Among the industries hardest hit by COVID-19 is live entertainment, and David Mitchell is in the thick of it.
   
 As general manager of the Performing Arts Center at Kent State University Tuscarawas in New Philadelphia, Mitchell saw his spring season of touring productions be canceled in one day.
   
 And as for the center's upcoming season of shows Mitchell had spend months booking, who knows?
   
 Industry-wide, "everybody, from New York to California, Milwaukee to Dallas, is in the same boat, trying to be innovative and creative and program something that can start pulling in some type of revenue." said Mitchell, a Lake High School graduate who started his job in December 2015.
   
 Q. How fast did everything shut down in March?
   
 A. "We had the Broadway tour of 'Finding Neverland' in on March 10, and even when the show was loading in and during the performance that night, it was obvious something was going to happen. The next day, everything shut down. Leading up to 'Neverland,' our ticket sales were down a bit. People had a growing hesitation to going out. About 75% of the people showed up (for 'Neverland'). It was a great last hurrah to go out with a Broadway show. At first we didn't know how long this (venue closure) was going to last, so I scrambled to push everything back three weeks. Then those rescheduled shows turned into cancellations."
   
 Q. How much of your current season did you lose? And was anything particularly painful?
   
 A. "We canceled six of our shows, but we also had proms, award ceremonies commencement, and dance recitals scheduled. Overall, we've canceled 30 or so events through the end of June. We had the A Cappella Live tour coming in, and I had a workshop scheduled with four different high-school choirs. To have those students miss out on that opportunity was pretty disappointing. All the (canceled shows) were selling fine. We had a lot of disappointed people."
   
 Q. And you refunded all of those tickets?
   
 A. "Yes. We made the decision to do full refunds for everybody. We didn't want to hold onto any ticketing funds. I've always thought the goodwill garnered by that outweighs the short-term cash-flow implications. What we returned was in the six-figure range."
   
 Q. What can you tell me about your upcoming season?
   
 A. "The entire season is in place at this point, but we're in a holding pattern, a wait-and-see. Typically, we would have announced in mid-May, but I've been working through things. September shows were rescheduled for later, but whether we open on October or January, I don't know at this point. We have 32 shows lined up, four Broadway shows, several major concert headliners. This is the fifth season I've programmed, and it's shaping up to be one of the best. I'm majorly bumming. Broadway tours are the biggest question mark. It's totally different than concerts where musicians might head out for the weekend. Broadway tours string together 40 or 50 cities all around the country. The ripple effect is mind-bending how far it goes."
   
 Q. How are you feeling about the future?
   
 A. "This entire industry has been turned upside down. Nobody has ever gone through something like this. If we reopen with capacity restrictions, for the headlining concerts and Broadway shows, the economics won't work. We need to bring together 600, 700, sometimes 800 people just to break even. (The center seats 1,089 people.) Right now, we're coordinating with 15 different theaters in Ohio to put together a survey and see what customer confidence is. Just because we're allowed to open doesn't mean people will come out."

A decade into the comeback, it would have been easy for Buzzcocks to rest on their laurels. Instead, they pulled a surprise on _Modern_. The core template was still in place, the overall chirpiness remained unsullied, but the instrumental palette was neatly refreshed. It was a mark of talent that they did so without throwing away the distinct traits which made them Buzzcocks.
 Song after song comes edged with intriguing touches. As an example, "Why Compromise" (one of the unused songs from the 1991 demo) features a stuttering guitar riff mirrored by a Morse code bleeping and a gurgling bass that stalks throughout the song. Shelley leans into a theatrical delivery that sells the song and its sage and thoughtful kōans. Diggle's "Don't Let the Car Crash" is one of the best songs of the entire Buzzcocks' revival. The song develops through several significantly different passages from the tension-filled wavering doppler-effect of the first verse, then the big signature choruses, a second verse graced with synthesizers, and then the chattering arpeggios that hook the ear on the third. There's no fall off as the album develops either. The final run of four songs from "Turn of the Screw" through closer "Choices" beats the album's solid opening spell because of strong lyrical conceits, effective delivery, neat tech-flourishes, and ripping punk hooks.
 Most of the songs here use a processed effect to tweak the introduction to a song then splice it to a solid pop-punk tune: "Soul on a Rock" is a perfect example. "Doesn't Mean Anything" is the song that takes things furthest with verses reduced to a shifting, surging weave of vocal layers, and the choruses left as the only unaffected and straightforward element. As an intriguing sidebar, a year later, Diggle would release _Some Reality_ , a solo album showing off his mod credentials. So it's interesting that by this point, he was comfortable sub-dividing interests and aspects of his talents given his songs on _Modern_ are the most laden with technology. A more subtle winner on the album is "Rendezvous", which loads its lyrical journey with good lines ("Before I knew, we had reached your stop / I blurted out something obscene") that would have made it a standout back in the post-punk past too.

 The White House briefing has often been contentious, long-winded and stuffed with hot air — emitted by both spinning political flaks and grandstanding reporters. It was all a bit of a game.

Trump has consistently demonstrated hostility toward oversight throughout his tenure in office. In 2017, the Trump White House directed federal agencies to refuse oversight requests from congressional Democrats, and the Department of Justice issued a legal opinion that justified the policy. While no administration welcomes oversight, particularly from the opposition political party, these instructions were an “escalation” of the normal give and take between the branches and the parties. The Trump administration’s recalcitrance escalated further after Democrats took control of the House in 2019, leading to litigation to force compliance with duly authorized subpoenas. Not to be outdone, Trump took the extraordinary step of suing House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings and a Democratic aide to block a private company from turning over his financial records. Trump has maintained this stance in 2020, announcing that he would allow Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to testify about the administration's coronavirus response before the Republican-led Senate, but not at a House subcommittee hearing led by Democrats.

 These sorts of bonuses happen weekly in _GTA Online_ , so if there's nothing your interested in here, be sure to check back next week to see what's new.

the issue is them rethinking their future designs scares me... Nvidia has started a HORRIBLE trend in the business that I hope to dear god AMD does not follow suite. True, Nvidia is able to produce more gaming performance for less, but this is pushing anyone who wants GPU compute to get an overpriced professional card. now before you say "well if you're making a living out of it, fork out the cash and go Quadro", let me remind you that a lot of innovators in various fields actually do use GPU compute to ultimately make progress (especially in academic sciences) to ultimately bring us better tech AND new directions in tech development... and I for one know a lot of government funded labs that can't afford to buy a stack of quadro cards

The strategy elements had grown stagnant on this front for many years, with developers just taking the old formula and adding some new bells and whistles. The addition of wonders and territory were notable, but were mostly just layered on elements atop of the same gameplay. Rise of Kingdoms would change this, carving out multiple new paths on this front.

Simultaneously, I understand the importance of both recording and showing the videos to as many people as possible. For some, seeing a lifeless body will be the only way that they believe the countless stories shared before to be true. This is especially critical when they don't share similar experiences with the people crying foul. If it's not laid out explicitly, clearly, in broad daylight, it will never be real. There's an immense problem with this.

Shah was also of the view that with the present crisis may lead to further consolidation. On the possibility of fall in property prices, he said that as prices have bottomed out over the past four years, they are unlikely to fall across the board, although there may be isolated cases of developers selling few flats at lower prices.

There was also the wind damage that hit parts of west Olathe. At first I thought it was a microburst but it might have been a small and brief little spin-up that lasted a block or two. Those would be the types of spin-ups that really can't be warned on ahead of time...just one of those things.

Put in annother way: What about a product for the growing number of video reviews on youtube and other such sites? They do a fair bit more editing than I do, yet as most of them are unpaid (or not well paid when getting started) something like a 570 with both game and editing features would be most helpful, and open up a lot more options for them without having to spend an arm and a leg. Once they get going and start raking in a bit of money then absolutely; Quadro is the way to go. But to start out on a budget the 570 was an excellent option at the time, and it does not look like it will be replaced on the nVidia side (though it looks like AMD is picking up the slack).

For the first time in its 167-year history, the railways' on board ticket checking staff will be without their customary black coats and ties and will instead wear gloves, masks, PPEs and check tickets with magnifying glasses, the national transporter has said in an order issued Friday in view of the coronavirus pandemic.
 These instructions are part of the guidelines for TTEs for the 100 pairs of special trains which will begin operations from June 1.
 "In order to prevent/reduce chances of infection, TTE staff may be asked to dispense with tie and coat. They will, however, put on their name and designation badge,” the guidelines said.

Real estate, which affects demand for home construction and home appliances, is still humming in Northeast Ohio, albeit with sales off by about 10 to 20% compared to last year, agents say.
   
 With department stores facing bankruptcy and hotels seeing huge occupancy dips, the real estate industry will accept moderate decline after Ohio declared real estate an essential business.
   
 Real estate agents throughout the region say the problem is a lack of willing sellers.
   
 They're spooked by fears of prospective buyers, appraisers, inspectors and contractors bringing coronavirus into their homes.
   
 LeeAnn Poth of Landes & Landes Real Estate in Wooster said some of her sellers have pulled their houses off the market.
   
 "Some are rentals, and they didn't want to risk their renters getting sick," she said. Another seller pulled a listing because they had an underlying health condition.
   
 Low supply
   
 The inventory of homes was already low before the pandemic, agents said, so moderately priced homes are getting multiple offers within days of hitting the market.
   
 "I'm getting calls everyday from people wanting to buy. But what they want isn't out there," Poth said. "I just had somebody call me today wanting to buy a horse farm and none are available" for less than $300,000.
   
 "You don't have the luxury of looking at three, four homes," said Stephen Boyles, owner and Realtor for Century 21 Wilbur in Kent. "If it's a decent value, there's going to be other people right there."
   
 Interest rates have dropped to about 3.5%, which Boyles called "dirt cheap."
   
 Seniors are still going into nursing homes, estates are selling homes of the deceased, couples are still getting divorced and people are still moving to switch jobs.
   
 New normal
   
 The use of sanitizer, wipes, gloves and even footsies for in-person showings have become standard protocol.
   
 In-person open houses are discouraged. Video showings whether recorded or streamed live have grown in popularity. Prospective buyers are often no longer visiting homes until they'e narrowed it down to their top choices.
   
 Dominic Fonte, a real estate agent for Cutler Realty based in North Canton, said agents who can't keep up with the trends won't be able to stay in the business.
   
 Boyles expressed concern about how the pandemic could impact Kent's big employer, Kent State University, which has instituted pay cuts in response to state budget cuts and declining enrollment. That could affect the local real estate market.
   
 "Even though there's been government subsidies, at some point if people can't make their mortgage payments, that's going to have a very negative effect on the market," he said, adding that a wave of foreclosures could flood the market with homes. "So things could change in a few months."
   
 He said if Ohio experiences a second wave of COVID-19 infections then it'll be less than the shock of March and "we're going to be better prepared for it."
   
 Fonte believes some who would have listed their home in March or April will do so in later in the year with many tiring of the stay-at-home order restrictions.
   
 He said while those who've lost jobs will opt out of planned purchases of homes, he believes that his 2020 sales could be about the same as in 2019.
   
 "I think it's going to pick up once people get used to the new normal," he said.
   
 Fonte does not see a repeat of 2008 and 2009 when many could not quickly sell their homes because they owed more their homes were worth.
   
 The firm CoreLogic last fall said the number of "underwater" or negative equity homes nationwide is the lowest since 2010.
   
 IPoth hopes she can return to doing more in-person showings. She believes they provide prospective buyers more insight.
   
 "At three to five years, I think we should be back to normal. This virus stuff can't last forever, certainly."

Slack to Acquire Fuze? Rumor Signals Sign of the Times

Last week I shared good things here. I asked people to tell me something good, and they did. Big good, little good, all good. The good news about the good news? There were way too many good news items to share in one column. So today, welcome to part two of Tell Me Something Good! Yes, I've capitalized it to make it, A THING!
   
 Chris Chickeral is spreading something very good. She's wearing her mask in public, but it was bothering her that no one could see her smile. She's come up with a solution. The other day, while out shopping for essentials, she encountered a stranger and said simply, "I'm smiling." The stranger said they were also smiling behind the mask. The two spent a moment trying to smile with their eyes. The result, the two strangers, erupted in peals of laughter together.
   
 I may begin telling people I encounter when I'm out and about, "I'm smiling," so they know what's happening behind my mask. Conversely, perhaps I'll say, "I'm scowling," if you touch all the grapes in the produce aisle at the grocery store before selecting one for your cart. Cut it out, by the way, you know who you are.
   
 Mask making continues! Christine Barber, a retired nurse, has sewn over one- thousand. Each mask was donated, given for free, because, as Chris says, "It is my way of still helping in the medical field. I hope it makes a difference." I am sure it does.
   
 Thousands of friends and strangers have come together to adopt high school seniors. The Facebook groups popped up to help honor high schoolers, who missed out on the traditional pomp and circumstance thanks to canceled or diminished ceremonies. The Toledo/Michigan Adopt a Senior Group made sure that every single senior, of the three-thousand in the group, were adopted, and honored.
   
 Wildlife continues to amaze, for every murder hornet story, there's a story of nature that inspires and brings comfort. Kelly Rudolph from the Northwest, Ohio River Runners Kayaking group, reports that the group is headed out to a local creek clean up. And for the first time, they're seeing beavers along the creek. Nature, running just a bit wild, has Kelly inspired, as it does a lot of us.
   
 Non-profits are going above and beyond in this harrowing time. Nature's Nursery, a wildlife refuge out of Whitehouse Ohio, is treating over one- thousand wild animals that need medical care or rehabilitation. Social distancing rules have forced them to limit the number of volunteers, yet they're experiencing a 43% increase in admissions. A spokesperson for the non- profit says the amazing staff is working overtime to look after for the dozens of creatures. Goodness!
   
 The Nature's Nursery story reminds us all to look around our own neighborhoods and communities. There is probably a charity working overtime, with fewer staff members, lower donations, and higher need. If you find a way to help, I want to know. Share it with me so I can share it here.
   
 Remember, I capitalized Tell Me Something Good to make it "A Thing." But that's not what makes something good, you're doing that. You're making good things, big and small, all around us.
   
 Thank you. I can't wait to hear more!

Although cases are declining overall, the UK had 4.54 deaths per million residents per day on a rolling seven-day average, according to figures from the Our World in Data website.
 More than 88,000 people died across England and Wales in April, making it the worst month for deaths since records began.
 Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that in April last year 44,123 people died.
 That figure, in the midst of the global coronavirus pandemic, almost doubled to 88,153.
 In April 2020, 27,764 people across England and Wales had coronavirus listed as their official cause of death.
 The 88,153 deaths figure was also a huge rise on the previous month, with March, which has 31 days, recording 49,723 deaths.
 During the press conference on April 30 during which the PM confirmed the UK as a whole was passed the peak of the virus, he said that despite the figures: "At no stage has our NHS been overwhelmed, no patient went without a ventilator, no patient was deprived of intensive care, we have five of the seven projected Nightingale wards.

As can be imagined, after a season reset, only a fraction of players return with the same interest and intent to spend. Any player would temper their spending in the game once they found out that even if they "won", it'd all be gone within a few months. Maybe it was a worthwhile experiment to try at the time, but it was a severe handicap in the end.
