 Gov. Ron DeSantis has suspended all foreclosures and evictions in Florida for 45 days in response to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 DeSantis announced he had signed an executive order to give people relief facing foreclosure or evictions during a press conference in Tallahassee on Thursday.
   
 "I'm not sure you're going to rent out a lot of new places right now anyways, but nevertheless you just never know how people act," DeSantis said. "So, given the circumstances, I think that those suspensions are warranted."
   
 The move comes as the national unemployment filings broke new records again this week with more than 6 million people filing unemployment insurance claims.
   
 "Just thinking about the scale of this, in 2019, Florida had a total of 307,701 claims for re-employment assistance," DeSantis said. "In the last two weeks, we received 348,511 claims."
   
 Florida's unemployment system is cracking under the pressure to process claims with people having trouble filing applications online or reaching people by phone.
   
 The number of people in Florida filing for unemployment benefits last week tripled from the previous week as the pandemic forced more counties and cities to issue stay-at-home orders. The Department of Labor reported Thursday that 227,000 Floridians initiated unemployment claims last week, up from 74,313 the previous week. Another 56,000 are expected this week as DeSantis issued a statewide stay-at-home order that took effect Friday.
   
 DeSantis said he has issued an order directing state agencies to find employees that can be temporarily assigned to the state Department of Economic Opportunity to help process claims or answer calls.
   
 "From August of 2018 to February of 2020, the contact center took a total of 2.39 million calls. DEO has taken 2.1 million calls this week alone," DeSantis said. "We're in a situation where this system is not handling the needs of the people of Florida in an adequate way. So, we need to do more to be able to get relief for the people of Florida."
   
 He said the state has about 25,000 workers who are either telecommuting or have been told to stay home.
   
 DeSantis said people deserve to at least get someone from the government on the phone and acknowledge they've filed a claim.
   
 "I wish I could say that this is just something that's only going to last a couple of weeks, but I think that this is not something that you can just turn on and off an economy like this," DeSantis said. "So we need to expand the capacity, but just understand that this is going to be a problem that could be with us more than just a couple of weeks."

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A cruise ship where at least two passengers died of coronavirus while barred from South American ports finally docked Thursday in Florida after two weeks at sea and days of negotiations with initially resistant local officials.
   
 The Zaandam and a sister ship sent to help it, the Rotterdam, were allowed to unload passengers at Port Everglades after working out a detailed agreement with officials who feared it would divert needed resources from a region that has seen a spike in virus cases.
   
 Broward County officials and Holland America, the company that operates the ships, announced the agreement shortly before the ships pulled into port.
   
 Holland America initially said 45 people who were mildly ill would stay on board until they recovered, but the docking plan released later Thursday indicated that 26 passengers and 50 crew members were ill. The plan noted that the company had secured access at two local hospitals for 13 passengers and a crew member who needed medical care.
   
 For nearly three weeks, passengers have not been able to step on dry land. Four elderly passengers died on the Zaandam, at least two from COVID-19, said William Burke, chief maritime officer for Carnival Corp., which owns the ships. Nine people had tested positive for the new coronavirus, Burke said earlier this week.
   
 There were 442 guests and 603 crew on the Zaandam, and 808 guests and 583 crew on the Rotterdam. The Rotterdam was sent last week to take in some of the passengers and provide assistance to the Zaandam since it was denied permission to dock at ports in South America.
   
 About 250 people have reported influenza-like symptoms since March 22, including 17 aboard the Rotterdam, according to the docking plan.
   
 Originally firmly opposed to the ships' arrival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that he had a change of heart after realizing many passengers were U.S. citizens and about 50 of them Floridians.
   
 He went further on Thursday, telling Fox News that allowing the ships to dock and transferring critically ill patients to hospitals was "the humanitarian thing to do."
   
 "I think the accommodations have been made, and I think that things are going to be done very thoughtfully," he said later at a news conference. "It's going to be a very controlled exit from these ships."
   
 COMPLETE COVERAGE | Coronavirus in Florida
   
 The docking plan indicated that Florida residents would leave the ship first, with the disembarkation of all passengers not concluding until Friday night.
   
 Passengers who have no symptoms of the virus will be bused to airports and put directly on charter flights without passing through the terminals, DeSantis said.
   
 Emily Spindler Brazell, of Tappahannock, Virginia, was still in her cabin waiting for instructions from the Rotterdam's captain but said she was relieved to be back home.
   
 "People greeted us, came out to their balconies, blew air horns and shouted, 'Welcome home!'" she said. "It was surprising. We went to many countries that said, 'We are not going to talk to you.'"
   
 Passenger Laura Gabaroni, of Orlando, said she would not be comfortable until she disembarked. She was transferred to the Rotterdam last Saturday, along with husband Juan Huergo and other passengers not showing signs of illness.
   
 "Many broken promises so far, so I'll believe it when I see it," she told The Associated Press via a WhatsApp message.

 Earlier this week state Superintendent Joy Hofmeister announced April 6 is the date for school districts to implement a distance learning plan to best fits their needs.
 “(The) plans will look different from district to district,” she said.
 “Many districts have used online tools for some time and will be able to hit the ground running. Others have little connectivity and communities with little or no access to computer technology.
 “I know the hard-working educators in our districts will pull together and make this adjustment to benefit all learners.”
 Along with today's distance curriculum coming together, Martin said Pauls Valley teachers at all levels are not only preparing to instruct their students while away from the actual school buildings, they're also getting some virtual training on the best ways to educate students with a distance learning plan.
 “We'll also be working toward professional development with our teachers in case we have to do this to start the next school year,” he said.
 Earlier this week a waiver was also approved allowing all school districts in the state to continue making breakfast and lunch available to students for free through the current school year.
 This week it was around 320 local students who received 640 meals each day as most were delivered to homes, while the rest were picked up by parents at a concession trailer set up at the back of the junior high. The pick up starts at 11 a.m. weekdays.
 Those interested in getting their child signed up for the nutrition program can call the superintendent's office, 405-238-6464, and leave a message.

Legends of Runeterra, the surprisingly great League of Legends spin-off card game, is launching on April 30, Riot Games announced today. In addition to adding support for iOS and Android devices—including crossplay between mobile and PC—the launch will also see the release of Runeterra's first new set of cards and a new Region, complete with its own playstyle and mechanics.
 That's exciting for open beta players who have been building their collection since January, especially since Riot recently overhauled the progression system to be even more generous by removing some of the limits on how quickly players could earn new cards. Fortunately, progress won't be wiped, either.
 In a press release, Riot said it would be adding over 120 new cards to the roster, putting the total at just over 400. We still don't know what these cards will be, or what the new Region is, but individual card reveals will start happening soon and continue over the coming weeks as we near Runterra's actual launch.
 In addition to the new cards, April 30 will also signal the end of Runeterra's first ranked season. Players will get a special icon according to what rank they reached, and a new season will begin with new rewards.
 Speaking of rewards, anyone who logs in before May 7 will also receive a special Moonstruck Poro Guardian to show off in duels. Guardians are little cosmetic characters that sit on your side of the playing board during matches.
 Looking forward, Riot already confirmed that multiple new sets are in the works, so players can look forward to even more cards in the future. Once Legends of Runeterra is launched, Riot has also committed to a surprisingly aggressive update schedule. New features and game modes will be added over time, but players can also expect regular updates every two weeks with bigger balance changes happening monthly.
 If you haven't played Legends of Runeterra yet, I recommend it. You don't have to rely on luck to get the cards you want from expensive booster packs but buy them directly—and there's a few different reward systems that throw free cards at you all the time. But Runeterra isn't just generous, either. It's got some really nifty twists like being able to store unused mana to use on later turns and ultra-powerful Champion cards that level up if you meet certain conditions. Check out my full review to find out more.

WASHINGTON (AP) — While Wisconsin struggles to hold its primary on Tuesday, President Donald Trump and Democrats are bickering over how to provide voters with safe and secure access to a ballot as the coronavirus pandemic rages in the U.S. and threatens to extend into the fall, affecting the general election.
 With another economic rescue package in the works, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she wants money to give more voters the chance to cast their ballot by mail, an option that would allow people to vote without the concern over the safety of polling places.
 But Trump opposes voting by mail and is leading Republicans in a battle to limit its use, arguing that it would encourage fraud and lead to so many people voting that his party could not win.
 But the 2020 presidential election is creeping ever closer, and there are no signs yet of the pandemic abating, nor any word on when Americans on orders to stay home can resume normal life, so lawmakers are trying to figure out how to allow for voting in a world where face-to-face contact causes anxiety at the least and possibly sickness and death.
 The debate is playing out now in Wisconsin. It stands apart from other states that have delayed primaries because of the virus, though Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has issued a statewide stay-at-home order.
 Evers initially joined Republican leaders in seeking to hold the primary as planned on Tuesday, but he now favors an all-mail election with absentee voting well into May. Republicans maintain that Tuesday’s in-person voting should go on as planned.

I think it's really important to- if you want to have a vocal piece with impact, for example, it's important to give it space that it needs for the player to experience it and to drive home the themes that the game has been implying all along. So I think that's something that we thought initially, but we're able to understand now what that entails a little bit better, which is cool. We learn new information about that on each project that we've done. I grew up with musical theater, from when I was five until I finished high school. So I certainly understand; I've had a lot of exposure to things where songs move the narrative, it's a whole medium that does just that. It's a thing that I care about and I really enjoy doing. I think in a lot of ways you can do that and each product is really different, so it depends on who's singing the song and what relationship the characters hold to the game. In most cases, the songs have been expressive of things about the world or characters, and helping deepen those particular aspects of the game world. I think _Pyre_ is the only time where there were really songs about exactly what was happening in the game.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Nearly 650 crew members of the Grand Princess completed their 14-day quarantine Saturday, ending a nearly month-long period of self-isolation that began when the cruise ship was struck with the coronavirus. The cruise line said the crew members can finally leave their staterooms and roam around the ship as long as they wear personal protective equipment and stay at least six feet from each other. The ship will leave San Francisco Bay and sail out to sea for several days of routine marine operations. Early next week, the ship will dock temporarily at the Port of San Francisco to stock up on provisions. The cruise line was still working out a plan on where it will go next. The cruise ship industry is currently under a 30-day suspension of all trips from the U.S. that took effect on March 14. This week, the U.S. Coast Guard directed cruise ships to be sequestered “indefinitely” offshore during the pandemic. The ship was forced to return to San Francisco in early March after more than a dozen people tested positive for the coronavirus. While passengers eventually disembarked at the Port of Oakland and taken to U.S. bases for quarantine, hundreds of crew members remained on board, under quarantine. Two male passengers were the first on board the ship to die from COVID-19, federal officials announced last week, while at least 103 had tested positive. A third person who died from COVID-19 was a crew member who died on April 1, said Negin Kamali, a spokeswsoman for Princess Cruises. “Our hearts go out to his family, friends, team members and all who are impacted by this loss,” she said.

The story was told during a 2013 press conference held to introduce Brad Stevens as the head coach of the Celtics.
 Danny Ainge, the team's president of basketball operations, recalled attending the 2010 Duke-Butler national championship game with team owner and Duke graduate Steve Pagliuca when legendary coach Mike Krzyzewski was paired against the 33-year-old Stevens.
 "As I sat there, I said to Steve at that time, 'That's the best coach in college basketball right down there on the sideline,' '' recalled Ainge. "He thought I was talking about coach K. We had a little debate about that.''
 A little more than three years after making that statement to Pagliuca, Ainge hired Stevens to coach the Celtics following the departure of Doc Rivers.
 The high praise from Ainge at the 2010 NCAA title game was part of a growing chorus of platitudes Stevens had earned for what he did with the Butler program.
 Promoted from a Butler assistant to the head coach in 2007, Stevens guided a school with less than 5,000 students to not one, but two national championship games, an improbable feat. No college that small had reached the title game since Jacksonville in 1970.
 The Bulldogs' first trip to the NCAA final was 10 years ago this week, a 61-59 loss to Duke on April 5, 2010 when a last-second shot from just over mid-court by current Celtics forward Gordon Hayward nearly went in.
 One year later, on April 4, 2011, with Hayward playing for the Utah Jazz, Butler was amazingly back in the title game, losing to the University of Connecticut, 53-41, with Stevens being denied by a team that was led by current Celtics guard Kemba Walker.
 Getting Butler, which was playing in the Horizon League, to one national final was incredible enough, but Stevens pulled it off 12 months later with his best player in the NBA.
 So when Ainge needed a coach to guide the Celtics in the post-Kevin Garnett/Paul Pierce era after Rivers went to the Los Angeles Clippers, he turned to Stevens, whose seventh season is currently on hold due to the coronavirus.
 Butler had been to nine NCAA tournaments before 2010 but had never moved past the Sweet 16. The 2009-10 season was something special, though, with the Bulldogs going 18-0 in the Horizon League and winning 25 straight games before the loss to Duke.
 In the NCAAs, fifth-seeded Butler defeated UTEP, Murray State, top-seeded Syracuse, second-seeded Kansas State and Michigan State in the semifinal round to get a chance to play Duke.
 The game took place at Lucas Oil Stadium, about five miles from the Butler campus in Indianapolis, giving the incredible story an even more magical feel. It was the first time a team played a national title game in its home city since UCLA in 1968.
 "The longer that season went, the more it was, hey, there's a chance,'' said Stevens in an interview with the Indianapolis Star five years ago. "I think that any year that team would've played in the tournament, that team would've had a chance. That wasn't a miracle run.
 "That team (which went 33-5) was legitimate. You never wanted it to end. Our guys just thought they would win. They prepared like they were going to win.
 "One thing, when we talk about Butler and what was special about those teams that we can go back now and say they literally did not care who they were playing. Ever.''
 That was true against Duke was a case in point. The Blue Devils had the reputation and the famed coach K on their side and were led by Jon Scheyer, Nolan Smith and Kyle Singler.
 Butler stayed right with Duke throughout and was down, 60-55, with just over three minutes left. The Bulldogs closed within 60-59 and had the ball with less than 10 seconds to play, but Hayward couldn't connect on a potential go- ahead 15-foot fadeaway shot with five seconds remaining.
 Duke's Brian Zoubek was then fouled, and after hitting the first free throw, he received the word from Krzyzewski to miss the second on purpose with three seconds to go.
 The ball wound up in Hayward's hands, and with no timeouts left, he rushed the ball to the right side of mid-court and let a shot go that hung in the air, hit the glass, bounced off the front of the rim but went out instead of in.
 That's how close Stevens, Hayward and Butler were to finishing their dream season with a shocking national title at the buzzer, falling inches short. Hayward finished just 2 for 11 and missed all three of his 3-pointers, scoring 12 points with 8 rebounds.
 "To win the national championship over Duke on a buzzer-beater, it would be hard to think of something that would top that,'' Hayward told the Indianapolis Star. "It's hard. I had a chance to make history. I wish I could shoot it again and get another chance to win the game. That's something I'll always carry with me.''
 After the game, Stevens, who looks the same now as he did on the Butler sideline a decade ago, spoke of how close the Bulldogs were to a miracle finish.
 "We came up one possession short in a game with about 145 possessions,'' he said that night 10 years ago. "It's hard to stomach when you're on the wrong end of that. We just came up a bounce short.''
 Nearly three months after that championship bid, Hayward was drafted No. 9 by the Jazz, one slot ahead of Paul George, who went to the Indiana Pacers. He spent seven seaons in Utah before reuniting with Stevens in Boston.
 While Hayward was off to the NBA after two collegiate seasons, Butler returned three starters in Matt Howard, Shelvin Mack and Ronald Nored in 2010-11.
 The Bulldogs were 14-9 and 6-5 in the Horizon League at one point in the season but they won nine of the next 10 games entering the NCAA tournament. Eighth-seeded Butler eliminated Old Dominion at the buzzer, top-seeded Pittsburgh, Wisconsin, second-seeded Florida and VCU in the national semifinal.
 That brought the Bulldogs back to the NCAA final where it faced Connecticut, a team that won five games in five nights to capture the Big East tournament championship after going 9-9 in the regular season.
 Walker was leading the way for the Huskies throughout the conference and NCAA tournaments, averaging 25 points during what became an 11-game winning streak for the championship.
 Butler held a 22-19 hafltime lead, but the Bulldogs suffered through a historically bad shooting game and could never get going against UConn.
 They were 12 for 64 in the game (19 percent), including 6 for 37 in the second half. Butler's 41 points were the lowest in a championship game since 1949.
 "I thought they challenged shots better than any team we played all year,'' said Stevens after the loss. "Sometimes shots go in, and that's basketball. But I don't want to just say shots didn't go in because UConn had a lot to do with it. Great teams give themselves a chance to win even when they're not shooting well, as UConn did.''
 It was Walker's final game at UConn as he went No. 9 to Charlotte in the 2011 draft, staying there until signing with the Celtics to play for Stevens last summer.
 "I've been a fan of Kemba for a long time,'' said Stevens at Walker's introductory press conference. "I remember watching him on the AAU circuit. I remember those New York Gauchos AAU teams well.
 "And obviously I saw him too close and personal when he was at UConn.''

Pakistani authorities are searching for tens of thousands of worshippers who attended an Islamic gathering in Lahore last month just as the novel coronavirus was taking root in the impoverished nation, officials told AFP on Saturday.
 Authorities want to test or quarantine those who congregated at the Tablighi Jamaat -- an Islamic missionary movement -- from March 10 to March 12 amid fears they are now spreading COVID-19 across Pakistan and overseas.
 Organisers say about 100,000 people went to the meeting, which took place despite government requests to cancel it in light of the worsening coronavirus pandemic.
 Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official at Lahore's district commissioner's office told AFP the gathering's location outside the eastern city has now been sealed off.
 "Authorities in all districts (of the country) are trying to find those who have attended the event," the official said.
 About 2,500 attendees -- including 1,500 foreigners -- who had remained around the event site, which includes a mosque and sleeping quarters, have been placed in quarantine.
 So far, at least 154 worshippers who went to last month's Jamaat have tested positive for coronavirus, with two fatalities to date, authorities told AFP.
 Working through word of mouth and from lists of names provided by Jamaat organisers, officials have so far tracked down approximately 7,000 attendees in Punjab province and placed them in quarantine.
 Tablighi Jamaat is considered one of the world's largest faith-based movements, with millions of followers, particularly in South Asia. It sends preachers to countries to spread Islam's ideals.
 According to organisers, a number of foreign nationals also attended this year's gathering from countries including China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Afghanistan.
 About 1,500 foreigners are now quarantined in Pakistan, but others left the country without being tested.
 On March 23, Gaza's health ministry confirmed its first two cases of coronavirus were Palestinians who had attended the gathering.
 Similar Tablighi Jamaat congregations were held in Malaysia and India amid the coronavirus pandemic and have been blamed for spreading the virus to other nations.
 Pakistan's Science Minister Fawad Chaudhry expressed exasperation the Jamaat took place, and blamed "the stubbornness of the clergy."
 "Any group of people who will not adhere to the government advice and will continue to do their normal activities will become a danger to others," he told AFP.
 Speaking to AFP, senior Tablighi preacher Naeem Butt said it was "ignorant" and "irresponsible" to blame the movement for spreading the virus.
 "We cancelled our event after two days when the authorities told us to do so," he said.
 At the time, organisers blamed rainy weather, not the virus, for ending the event.
 Coronavirus has killed at least 41 people in Pakistan, though with only limited testing available, observers worry the number is far higher.

For those without direct deposit, Mnuchin promised checks would go out quickly in a matter of "weeks."
   
 The announcement followed a memo sent out by House Democrats that warned some Americans could have to wait up to 20 weeks - or five months - before they receive their checks.
   
 When asked about the memo, which was sent out by the House Ways and Means Committee, during a White House coronavirus task force briefing Thursday, Mnuchin said it was "not going to take" that long.
   
 "Quickly, as a matter of weeks and not months," Mnuchin said of the money going out.

 He said the IRS was working on establishing a portal that would allow those for whom the IRS does not have direct deposit information to input their banking information, allowing Americans to get a check faster.
   
 The Treasury Department told USA TODAY the first batch of stimulus checks would go out in two weeks, meaning about 50 million to 70 million Americans would get the money directly into their bank accounts by April 15. Over the next three weeks, the department said the "overwhelming majority of eligible Americans" will have received their payment.
   
 The Democratic memo, sent out to House Democrats by the House Ways and Means Committee, offered a timeline for when the checks could reach Americans. The notice highlighted that the timeline was based off "extensive conversations with the IRS and the Department of Treasury" and was subject to change.
   
 The memo said around mid-April, likely the week of April 13, the Internal Revenue Service planned to issue payments to about 60 million Americans through direct deposit. These payments will be made to those whom the IRS has direct deposit information for from their 2018 and 2019 tax returns, the memo notes.
   
 Three weeks later, the IRS would start issuing paper checks, the Democratic memo noted. This process would take more time, and House Democrats say the IRS informed them that it has a capacity to issue about 5 million of these checks per week.
   
 The IRS does not have direct deposit information for about 90 million to 110 million Americans, meaning getting checks to all of these individuals could take up to 20 weeks, or about five months, before all Americans receive this financial relief via checks. Those with lower incomes would get assistance first, the memo adds.
   
 Mnuchin poured water on the figures, explaining that the aim was to limit the number of paper checks going out and instead get more Americans signed up for direct deposit. He noted money would go out on a rolling basis for those who supply their information to the department, including through the new portal being set up later this month.
   
 "We don't want to send checks in this environment," he said. "We don't want people to get checks. We want to put money directly into their accounts."
   
 Mnuchin added: "This money does people no good if it shows up in four months, and we will deliver on that promise."

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and more than two dozen confirmed domestic cases, on March 31, the national election board of Ethiopia announced that the country’s parliamentary elections will be postponed from August 2020 to a yet-unannounced date. Original plans for the elections to be held in May had already been postponed due to concerns that neither the parties nor the authorities would be prepared. This more recent delay resulted from fears around the spread of COVID-19 and the disease’s likelihood of inhibiting normal political procedures. Notably, both the incumbent administration and prominent opposition parties have signaled support for the delay. The national election board will announce a new date for the parliamentary vote once the current concern over the pandemic subsides.

The company’s profitability fared much better, scoring a 9 out of 10 rating on the back of strong returns that outperform a majority of competitors. Its operating margin is in decline, however. Magellan also has a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 4, which indicates business conditions are stable. As a result of a decline in revenue per share over the past 12 months, the company’s 4.5-star business predictability rank is on watch. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank typically return 10.6% per annum over a 10-year period.

Yeah, my main instrument is guitar, so I definitely tend to have guitar be the first place I come from, but it's not always the first place. It really depends on the game and the sonic pallet for that game. If I'm trying to write- for _Hades_ , for example- guitar is usually not where I start because I've got all of these Mediterranean instruments that are important to the palette of the game. I try to write on these instruments that I don't necessarily know mechanically, but they're like the guitar so I can play them physically. So I think that helps me ground the music in the palette that I set up, and it helps me use my ears more. I like writing on instruments that I'm not great at because it helps me ignore the sort of muscle memory of chords I like to play. Playing on an instrument with different tuning, those chord shapes I'm used to are not going to sound the same on a different instrument with standard tuning. So it really forces me to use my ears and allow that to guide the process.

Muslims have lost faith in all institutions in the country—government, police, judiciary, media, civil society and political parties. They know that hate against them is spreading like wildfire among Hindus. They also know that among the disseminators of hatred are people who hold the highest positions in the land, who meticulously work on new laws and policies aimed at consigning Muslims to an infernal existence in their own country. This kind of an abject situation is fertile for radicalism and extremist tendencies to take root. Unless a political and social leadership—with a strong moral fibre and committed to the values and ideals of the Constitution—emerges within the community, the existing leadership vacuum will be filled by impetuous zealots and cynical rabble-rousers.

Third, our political history has demonstrated that marginalised communities tasted political empowerment and a modicum of self-confidence only when they organised themselves politically--BSP, SP, RJD, IUML are some examples. Fourthly, a right-thinking social and political leadership for Muslims now is the best bet against possible radicalisation and foolhardiness. The political situation now is so completely pitted against the community that extremist elements wanting to fish in troubled waters will find their task much easier. Our pride in the fact that only a few hundred Indian Muslims out of 200 million ever joined the ranks of global Jehadi outfits may soon become passé. Indian Muslims never fell for jehadi adventurism precisely because the sense of equal citizenship the Constitution granted them made them feel at home in spite of it being far from equal in reality. Now they feel a sense of betrayal by allies on one hand and a sense of psychological disenfranchisement and imminent denial of citizenship, even physical annihilation by enemies, on the other.
