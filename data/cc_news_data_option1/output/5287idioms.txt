 “We discussed many different ways to hold the event safely, but they all presented at least some risk of spreading COVID-19. We want to do the right thing for Galveston, so we can all celebrate together another time.”

 # Local wrestling organization donates toys, gifts to area families in need this Christmas
 Logan Weaver
 Lancaster Eagle-Gazette
 View Comments
 LANCASTER - A local wrestling organization continued its tradition this year of hosting a toy drive to assist area families in need.
 Chris Cruit is the owner of the PWA School for Professional Wrestling on Slocum Street in Lancaster. Since 2015, Cruit and his wife have helped families and their children who may not have been able to afford Christmas gifts without their help.
 "I'm just super excited that we're able to do stuff like this and help people out," Cruit said. "You don't know how much a gift helps somebody... We try to do as much as we can, but we're never able to do as much as we'd like. But we try to do as much as we honestly can this year."
 This year's toy drive almost didn't happen. Cruit will be the first to admit that he entered a "2020 funk" before receiving words of encouragement from an event sponsor to continue the giving this holiday season.
 "We're not doing a lot of shows, it's going to be hard, and Skip Brown from Skip's Hauling was like 'hey man, you're doing the toy drive this year, right?'" Cruit said. "He really got me back into it and I think we had a pretty decent toy drive, I think."
 With the help of area sponsors, Cruit and PWA were able to donate over $500 worth of toys and other gifts to at least two area families this holiday season.
 "We ended up with a second family, because once we got the first family taken care of we had some money leftover," Cruit said. "My wife does not like having extra money, so we went out and spent it and then some."
 Cruit said he enjoys being able to help out those in need in Lancaster, and encourages other businesses within the area to find ways to give back during the holidays.
 "If you're here in town and you're doing business with the community if you're taking their money, you've got to be willing to put something back in," Cruit said. "We have a couple of sponsors that helped out a lot this year."
 Under normal circumstances, the PWA offers posters for sale and raffles during their events with the proceeds going towards the toy drive. However, Cruit the lack of events because of the COVID-19 pandemic put the PWA in a bind before sponsors chipped-in to help sponsor families this season.
 Cruit thanked Skip's Hauling, Miracle's Flooring, and Marco's Pizza for being sponsors in this year's toy drive and providing the funds to assist a second family.

Madrid [Spain], December 24 (ANI): Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane said he is "thrilled" for the players after the club secured their sixth successive win in all competitions.
 Real Madrid extended their winning streak with a 2-0 win over Granada in the La Liga here on Thursday.
 "A very hard-earned win. In the end, it was a really tough clash. We said in the build-up that it was going to be a very difficult game. They came out to press high and they did it very well, we struggled in the first half but we were much better after the break. I'm thrilled for the players because it's not at all easy to win six games in a row. We deserved the win following our second-half performance," the club's official website quoted Zidane as saying.
 "We were much improved in the second half, we won the ball back better, came out on top in one-on-ones, somewhere they were beating us before the break. We knew what we were in for, we've beaten a very good side who have picked up a number of fantastic results. We have to be pleased because winning six in a row is no mean feat. So I'm extremely grateful to the players," he added.
 Casemiro scored the opening goal of the match in the 57th minute before Karim Benzema doubled the lead in the dying minutes of the game. The club will now return to action on December 31 when they take on Elche.
 Zidane said he wants the player to rest now before they start putting up a fight again on the field.
 "We're going to keep working hard. We have an awful lot of games, we should be pleased with what we're doing. That's six wins in a row and we have to keep fighting on the pitch as we are, as a team. That's all I ask of the players, but I want them to rest up first because this is a time to be with family. Then, when we come back we'll be back to working very hard," he said. (ANI)

LANSING -- A bill that would fund vaccine distribution, bolster the restaurant industry and extend unemployment for Michigan residents suffering from the economic shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic was sent to the governor's desk Monday for approval.
   
 According to a news release, state Rep. Bronna Kahle, R-Adrian, helped lead efforts in the state House to get the measures approved.
   
 "There are brighter days ahead for Lenawee County and Michigan - and this measure will help us get there," Kahle said in the release. "A vaccine is here, and this funding will help distribute it more quickly and effectively. In the meantime, I continue to fight for the families and small businesses who through no fault of their own have had their livelihoods disrupted by the virus and the governor's shutdown orders. People are hurting. They're fighting for their way of life. This financial relief will help until normalcy is restored."
   
 The plan, passed as Senate Bill 745 includes a total of $465 million in funding and was passed by the House Monday with 97 representatives voting in support of the bill, five opposed and eight not voting. The bill also passed in the Senate Friday in a 35-2 votes, with one excused member.
   
 State Sen. Dale Zorn, R-Ida, voted in favor of the bill.
   
 "This critical relief funding will help both our incredible health care workers battling the virus and the thousands of Michigan workers and job providers struggling to make ends meet," Zorn said in a news release Friday. "The governor's shutdowns continue to have an enormous impact on our economy and people's lives -- with many workers losing their jobs and locally owned businesses facing the loss of their livelihoods. This funding was approved with significant bipartisan support to give them much-needed assistance, including extended unemployment benefits and survival grants for impacted small businesses.
   
 "If signed by the governor, this support will bring the total amount of resources we have invested in combatting this virus to nearly $4 billion."
   
 Approximately $220 million of the plan will go towards extending unemployment benefits for those who have been forced out of work by the pandemic shutdowns, extending benefits by six weeks until March. Unemployed workers will now be eligible for up to 26 weeks of benefits.
   
 The addition does not add any additional burden on employers.
   
 The plan also includes provisions to allow those who leave their job due to domestic violence be eligible for benefits and $45 million set aside for employee assistance -- providing grants of up to $1,650 to employees impacted by current Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) orders replace lost wages.
   
 Restaurants and small businesses will be able to receive small grants if they have been shut down or restricted by the governor's latest orders. This measure is supported by $55 million in the bill, according to the release.
   
 One of the most important parts of the bill is the funding provided to support the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines throughout the state. The bill includes $50 million to support distribution efforts and $22.5 million to boost virus testing efforts, focused especially on nursing homes.
   
 Another $42 million will support temporary staffing and wage increase for direct care workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 battle.
   
 According to the release, the bill is an addition to the Legislature's commitment to fight the repercussions of COVID-19, which included approving more than $3 billion from state budgets earlier this year and allocation of more than $6 billion federal unemployment funds.
   
 "This has been a year of unfathomable sacrifice and suffering - but we will get through it by working together and supporting each other," Kahle said.

An appeal for funds to help with funeral expenses went up on a crowdsourcing site last weekend. The post identified the victims as 18-year-old Lexis Marvin, 15-year-old Hailey Marvin and their father, Jeffrey Marvin.
 Neighbors said the three lived together on one side of a rental duplex along Spring River Drive. A small memorial of flowers, stuffed animals and angel statues decorated the porch Wednesday.
 “His whole life was about those girls and taking care of them and protecting them. Like, he guarded them. It’s tragic. It’s just really tragic,” said Kim Bishop, a neighbor and friend.
 Bishop and her husband, Jeff, said they’d known Marvin and his daughters for years, estimating he’d lived in the residence for the past 10 to 15 years.
 “We’ve known the girls since they were probably in elementary school, or better,” Jeff Bishop said.
 The couple talked about how the girls would play with their dog growing up; how Marvin would help Jeff Bishop work on a car in their garage; how Jeff would help Marvin fix lawn mowers or other projects, and that he was always willing to lend a hand.
 But, the Bishops said they’d learned a family member of Marvin’s hadn’t heard from the three since about Dec. 13 . The week had gone by, and they realized that despite this being a busy time of year, they hadn’t seen the Marvins coming and going, and his car hadn’t moved in days.
 Kim said she was the one who called police to have them check on the family, which led to the discovery of the scene last Friday.

HUNTINGTON — The Fairfield Community Development Corp. moved toward the end of the year with the appointment of RaShad Sanders as its first executive director.
 A longtime Huntington resident and Marshall University alumnus, Sanders has been active in the Huntington community and on campus since his graduation with a bachelor’s degree in business administration in 2007. While a student, Sanders served as president of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and facilitated a number of community service projects in Fairfield. He was also active in Black Students United, and has served as a counselor for exceptional high school students around the community.
 With his decorated history of community service and nearly a decade of experience as a purchasing agent, and later a contract specialist, for Marshall University, Sanders seemed like the perfect pick to the FCDC’s board of directors.
 “RaShad Sanders brings to the table a unique skill set that will enable the FCDC to accomplish its key objectives,” said MaRia Hill, FCDC board chairwoman. “He has a vested interest in Fairfield’s success because it is the community that raised him.”
 Though he has no specific projects in the works just yet, Sanders says he and the board intend to lift Fairfield up going into 2021 by maintaining their five pillars of importance: education, safety, health and wellness, economic growth and housing. Sanders also believes that efforts to foster and maintain community upkeep and cleanliness will greatly improve the lives of Fairfield’s residents.
 “If you see something positive outside, you’ll have a positive attitude that day,” said Sanders. “I think that revitalizing the community and getting back to the roots of how things were, we’ll see that it starts to thrive and grow again.”

Often, I will go back in my mind and try to place myself into historical events and periods of time -- with the hope of trying to realize what the participants actually felt -- and I imagine how I would respond. It's a game I play every now and then.
   
 There is a period in history that absolutely fascinates me. It centers around Jesus' birth. To be honest, Christ's entire earthly life -- death, burial, resurrection, ascension and birth of the early church -- intrigues me greatly, but the beginning is what is timely now, as we prepare for Christmas once again.
   
 Exhausted from a seven-day trek originating in Nazareth where Joseph lived, he and his very pregnant teenage fiancee, Mary, finally arrive in Bethlehem; the ancestral birthplace of his relative King David to be enrolled by the Roman government in the census.
   
 Joseph just wants to sit down. Walking for seven days has his feet swollen and covered with dust, and Mary, although not a complainer, has been uncomfortable, especially riding their donkey for this extended journey.
   
 As the contractions start, her betrothed becomes anxious and is desperately trying to find suitable shelter. Bethlehem is teaming with Joseph's relatives. They have all descended on this little village and there is absolutely no comfortable lodging for them anywhere.
   
 Finally, he finds a family that will allow them to stay in their stable below with the livestock. At least the animals will provide added warmth to the cool night air.
   
 Then, at just the right moment, in the fullness of time … this young girl delivers her firstborn, bonds with her son, wraps him up with swaddling clothes and lays him down in the feeding trough.
   
 Mary knows who this child is and so does her soon-to-be husband. She just gave birth to the King of kings and the Lord of lords. And yet, they quietly observe this moment in time and try to capture the weight and reverence of what just happened and of what will be.
   
 Just outside of town, there are shepherds guarding their sheep. As they try to keep awake, the sky lights up with a radiance they have never seen before. If they were asleep, they are awake now … and they witness the sights and sounds of myriads of angels announcing the Good News of great joy that will be for them and all of humanity.
   
 These angelic messengers, with great jubilation, exclaim that this very night in their village a Savior has been born who is Christ the Lord. They are blown away by this display of magnificence and they hurry off to see this Wonder of Wonders a short distance away from their resting place. When they arrive at the manger, the parents of Jesus are told what the shepherds witnessed with their eyes, ears and hearts. Mary and Joseph listen intently and marvel as everyone gazes in awe at the miracle lying before them.
   
 The coming of the Messiah to the world was proclaimed and foretold over many centuries. This Immanuel hope was a generational longing. Old Testament prophesy was at last fulfilled by sending God's promise in the flesh to the earth. This little baby would change everything.
   
 "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this." Isaiah 9: 6-7 NIV
   
 We have the perspective of looking back. Those eyewitnesses that first Christmas evening were experiencing in real time the moment when the very hand of God lovingly reached into our world and extended physically to us His only Son.
   
 I hope this year at Christmas, all of us will be able to carve out some quiet time, so we can appreciate a bit more deeply the awe and reverence that the first participants felt in that little corner of the world … as the cool evening air softly caressed the face of our Savior; that night when God became a man.

Nancy (Ann) Butler Klein, RN, of Ann Arbor, Mich., died Tuesday, Dec. 22, 2020.
 If you knew Nancy Klein then you were familiar with her signature laugh. She loved to laugh and she laughed loud and often. Her laugh was silenced too soon when she lost her battle with Parkinson’s disease and COVID-19.
 Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, her husband and daughters were able to say their final goodbyes at her bedside.
 Nancy was born Oct. 14, 1936, in Wilkes-Barre, to Edward and Stella Butler, she was the oldest of three children. She graduated from St. Mary’s High School and Mercy Hospital School of Nursing, both in Wilkes-Barre. In November of 1959, she married Bernie (Bernard) Klein, the love of her life, and they lived in Waynesboro and Baltimore, Md., before they moved to Ann Arbor in 1972.
 Nancy was preceded in death by her parents; her son, Barney (Bernard) Klein; and her brothers, Edward and Richard.
 She is survived by her husband; her children, Kathy (Mike) Dorsey; Chris Gonzalez; Karen Klein; her daughter-in-law, Marnie Reid; son-in-law Camilo Gonzalez; her grandchildren, Monica (Brian) Fall; Sara (Brian) Thacker; Andrew (Brandie) Dorsey; Nick (Lilo) Gonzalez; Alex Gonzalez; Connor Reid Klein; and Patrick Reid Klein; and her great-grandchildren, Lily Fall; Olivia Fall; and Lucy Thacker.
 During her nursing career, she worked for Charles Burns, M.D., in Wilkes- Barre, at Waynesboro General Hospital, at Baltimore’s Mercy Hospital, Parkview Convalescent Home in Ypsilanti, Mich., Amicare Home Health and St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, Ann Arbor, Mich. In her retirement, Nancy did volunteer work at the Packard Road Clinic, Food Gatherers and Motor Meals.
 Nancy, also lovingly known as the Laundry Goddess, will be remembered by family and friends for her “perfectly alright” (burned) food, her threatening slippers, her name-calling and middle finger antics with her kids, her love of her grand and great-grandkids and of course, her laugh, we will all replay that laugh in our hearts forever. Family gatherings were not complete without Nancy’s rice pilaf, rice crispy treats, brownies and eventually she became the muffin lady for her grandkids after-school treats.
 Nancy was very generous and always thought of others first. She never forgot a birthday. She was always ready to add another old lady to her collection to take care of. She was shy and she was feisty. Her nurse colleagues called her “Sarge.” Nancy loved her work and loved her patients, going on to be a friend and caregiver to one for over 20 years.
 Nancy didn’t like to stray from home too often, but shared adventures with Bernie to Hawaii, Mackinac Island, the annual family reunion “Pig Roast” and the rival family reunion dubbed the “Dog Roast.”
 In light of the pandemic, a Catholic Mass is being planned for the future.
 In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

TAMPA, Fla.
 The Toronto Raptors had their home floor shipped 1,300 miles when they relocated to Tampa for at least the start of the NBA season. Yet it was the New Orleans Pelicans who looked at home at Amalie Arena in the season opener for both teams.
 JJ Redick converted a four-point play with just over a minute remaining and finished with 23 points, and Brandon Ingram led all scorers with 24 points as the Pelicans rallied from an 11-point deficit and beat the Raptors 113-99 on Wednesday night.
 Zion Williamson had a big second half for the Pelicans and finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Eric Bledsoe and Steven Adams scored 18 and 16 points, respectively, in their first games with the Pelicans, who delivered new coach Stan Van Gundy a victory in his New Orleans debut.
 "I'd say that we fought very hard in a game that was very, very frustrating," Van Gundy said. "We were turning the ball over, we were in foul trouble, not a lot was going right for us. We hung in there and kept fighting and then made enough plays and enough shots to pull away."
 Pascal Siakam led the Raptors with 20 points. Kyle Lowry finished with 18 points and 10 assists.

As a sum of all its parts, theatre in India engages a workforce of not inconsiderable proportions raring to go where the turf of performance beckons, even in the face of immense odds. Perhaps, a defining aspect of this resilience came in the shape of multiple relief efforts that specifically targeted artistes from the performing arts. For instance, the Assistance for Disaster Affected Artistes fund, which brought together grassroots organisations like the Rajasthan-based Pehchaan Lok Sangeet Sansthan Maharashtra’s Yalgaar Sanskrutik Manch, and raised Rs 42 lakhs through crowd- funding. The efforts brought into focus the pitfalls of being in a so-called ‘unorganised sector’ with many freelance theatrewallahs beyond the pale when it came to state-sponsored funds.

TECUMSEH -- Downtown Tecumseh may not have been as successful as it has been had it not been for the actions of a man who acquaintances and close friends say impacted Tecumseh and Lenawee County to an extent more than most people will ever know.
   
 Despite his generosity, both as a mentor and benefactor, Donald James "DJ" Martin, 80, is being remembered by members of the Tecumseh community as someone who never sought the recognition he deserved.
   
 Martin died Dec. 1 at ProMedica Hickman Hospital from complications of COVID-19 and preexisting conditions.
   
 "He was quite a guy. He had a good disposition. Like I was telling some of my friends, my dad always said, 'The worst day in my life was still the best day in my life,'" David Martin, 55, his son and owner of Martin's Home Center in downtown Tecumseh, said. "You know, he never held grudges. He always believed in second chances. He was a very easy man to work with as a boss."
   
 DJ Martin was the owner of Martin's Home Center, located on the corner of West Chicago Boulevard and North Pearl Street. The store was started by DJ Martin's father in 1947 as Gambles Hardware. At the time before big box stores, malls and online shopping, the store pioneered the combination of hardware and home goods such as appliances and furniture in the same store.
   
 As Gambles declined, DJ Martin realized it was going to be bought out and in the early 1980s, switched to Ace Hardware. But unlike other Ace Hardware stores, Martin decided to continue his relationship with appliance and furniture vendors, retaining the Gambles model and becoming Martin's Home Center.
   
 What's been described as downtown Tecumseh's anchor store remained successful due to Martin's business sense and the goodwill he created among his customers, competing successfully with big box retailers and passing the operation of the store to his son and daughter. Even still, he continued to be at the store every day.
   
 "Growing up here, everybody knew who DJ Martin was because he was so generous to the community," Jessica Sattler, Tecumseh economic development coordinator, said. "He was always giving to the schools and never really seeking credit for that -- but we knew. We knew what they did and what an important business it was to the community and what an important person he was in the community."
   
 In her few years with the city already, Martin has been a mentor to Sattler, who she said would often help her work through deals when companies were looking at purchasing downtown property.
   
 "He was an anchor, a leader. I'm so grateful that his family is going to carry on his legacy, but his loss will be felt very, very deeply," Sattler said.
   
 Martin was Mr. Tecumseh, according to Tecumseh Mayor Jack Baker, who has known the Martin family since he was a child. Baker's oldest sister is best friends with DJ Martin's sister.
   
 "DJ was the best man I ever knew who was concerned about the city. He did everything he could to make the city of Tecumseh better," Baker said. "He never, ever wavered from that. He never looked the other way. He was all Tecumseh. … If you looked for a guy or a person who was Tecumseh, it was DJ Martin."
   
 On Nov. 16, only a few weeks before Martin's death, Baker waited on him at his early morning stop at the Perky Pantry where Baker works and had a conversation with him as usual.
   
 "I waited on DJ every Monday morning. I've done it for 30 years. Plus, he was a longtime customer of mine and he still was. I waited on him and we had a great conversation as we always do. … He's the best businessman I ever knew. By far, no question," Baker, who owned a gas station across from Martin's Home Center, said. "And, in addition to being a businessman, … he's a hell of a good guy.
   
 "And he gave back to this community more than anyone other than myself and a few others will ever know, and for that I'm very thankful. … He wanted zero recognition. But I will tell you this, if it wasn't for DJ Martin, Tecumseh would not be the city that it is today."
   
 Tecumseh marketing coordinator Rhonda Nowak said Martin was not only a family friend through her parents, who operated Great Ideas interior design company that did business with Martin's Home Center, but he was also a mentor to her in business career as well as someone she could always go to for support when putting on community events.
   
 "Always a character. Always wanted to have fun, but was also always business," Nowak said. "Just a joy to work with. Learned a lot from the man about persevering when things are tough and to keep going and keep your head on straight."
   
 Nowak said Martin had an incredible impact on the community, taking a lot of people under his wing as their mentor.
   
 He also privately helped people in need, whether it was help with an appliance or a place for someone to stay, without anyone knowing.
   
 He was also a person she would often call for help sponsoring community events.
   
 "If we were in a position where we needed a little bit more sponsorship, that we can go and talk to DJ and he would help us out just so that we can make sure that the events came off without a hitch," she said.
   
 What may have had one of the biggest impacts on the city's downtown was Martin not going through with one of his plans.
   
 On Dec. 15, 2000, a snowstorm overnight caused the collapse of the store's roof. While there were no injuries, the future location of the store was in question.
   
 According to David Martin, he and his father had already made plans to move west of the city to a property they owned, until recently the location of Shopko, as they had outgrown their downtown space and wanted to expand further.
   
 They had already contracted a company in Ann Arbor to draw up architectural plans for the new location.
   
 When the roof collapsed, David Martin said they talked over the move. Both realized they and their families had grown up working in the store on that same corner.
   
 If they were going to move west of downtown, the damage would require the building to be torn down, leaving the corner of downtown empty.
   
 "I told my dad when we were talking about it, …'You know, now that the roof collapsed,' I said, 'I grew up on this corner. I've been here my whole life … this is where half my family's growing up is right here,'" David Martin said.
   
 DJ Martin felt the same, having also worked at the store since childhood with his sister and parents also working there.
   
 He made the decision to renovate the store, creating more space on the second floor for the showroom, and reopened the store exactly one year from when the roof collapsed.
   
 "I would tell you this, he saved downtown Tecumseh. … We were all concerned that he would take his business out there (to the west side of Tecumseh). And, instead, he chose to stay downtown," Baker said. "DJ saved downtown Tecumseh. There's no question."

Once hailed as drivers of economic prosperity and symbols of the country’s technological prowess, Alibaba and rivals like Tencent Holdings Ltd. face increasing pressure from regulators after amassing hundreds of millions of users and gaining influence over almost every aspect of daily life in China.
 Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock slid as much as 7.7% to a five-month intraday trough, while Tencent and internet services giant Meituan declined more than 1%. Shares in SoftBank Group Corp., Alibaba’s largest shareholder, erased gains to trade as much as 2.7% lower in Tokyo.
 Investors are divided over the extent to which Beijing will go after Alibaba — Asia’s largest corporation after Tencent — and its compatriots as Xi Jinping’s government prepares to roll out a raft of new anti-monopoly regulations. The country’s leaders have said little about how harshly they plan to clamp down or why they decided to act now. Draft rules released in November give the government unusually wide latitude to rein in tech entrepreneurs like Ma, who until recently enjoyed an unusual amount of freedom to expand their empires.
 "It’s clearly an escalation of coordinated efforts to rein in Jack Ma’s empire, which symbolized China’s new ‘too-big-to-fail’ entities,” said Dong Ximiao, a researcher at Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute. "Chinese authorities want to see a smaller, less dominant and more compliant firm.”
 The flamboyant Alibaba co-founder has all but vanished from public view since Ant’s initial public offering got derailed. As of early December, with his empire under regulatory scrutiny, the man most closely identified with the meteoric rise of China Inc. was advised by the government to stay in the country, a person familiar with the matter has said. Alibaba representatives weren’t immediately available for comment.
 The country’s internet ecosystem — long protected from competition by the likes of Google and Facebook — is dominated by two companies, Alibaba and Tencent, through a labyrinthine network of investment that encompasses the vast majority of the country’s startups in arenas from AI to digital finance. Their patronage has also groomed a new generation of titans including food and travel giant Meituan and Didi Chuxing — China’s Uber. Those that prosper outside their aura, the largest being TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd., are rare.
 The anti-monopoly rules now threaten to upset that status quo with a range of potential outcomes, from a benign scenario of fines to a break-up of industry leaders. Beijing’s diverse agencies now appear to be coordinating their efforts — a bad sign for the internet sector.
 The People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, warned Thursday that fighting alleged monopolies was now a top priority. "Anti-monopoly has become an urgent issue that concerns all matters,” it said in a commentary coinciding with the probe’s announcement. "Wild growth” in markets needs to be curbed by law, it added.
 The campaign against Alibaba and its peers got into high gear in November, after Ma famously attacked Chinese regulators in a public address for lagging the times. Market overseers subsequently suspended Ant’s IPO — the world’s largest at $35 billion — while the anti-monopoly watchdog threw markets into a tailspin shortly after with its draft legislation.
 The chances that Ant will be able to revive its massive stock listing next year are looking increasingly slim as China overhauls rules governing the fintech industry, which in past years has boomed as an alternative to traditional state-backed lending.
 China is said to have separately set up a joint task force to oversee Ant, led by the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a financial system regulator, along with various departments of the central bank and other regulators. The group is in regular contact with Ant to collect data and other materials, studying its restructuring as well as drafting other rules for the fintech industry.
 "China has streamlined a lot of the bureaucracy, so it’s easier for the different regulatory bodies to work together now,” said Mark Tanner, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy China Skinny. "Of all the regulatory hurdles, this is the biggest by a long shot.”

As I drove out of my office last Friday, I noticed a slight commotion on the opposite side of the express road. I sighted a truck belonging to the Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and soon enough, I saw this poor woman, begging on her knees as agents of the (AEPB) seized her wares and were about to empty these into the back of their wagon. Instinctively I just knew I had to plead for this woman. I had seen so many heartbreaking situations such as this and had not been able to do anything about them, but this time I drove across the road and blocked the truck. I came down to intervene and asked the AEPB team what they had to gain by giving this middle-aged poor woman grief that afternoon. The team lead was a stern-looking rough guy, who made to challenge me. I told him I came in peace but there was no way I was going to watch them take the wares that may not have been worth more than N2,000 from this woman.

The high-flying antics of Ja Morant that were a hallmark of the ex-Murray State guard's rookie season with the Memphis Grizzlies have followed him into his sophomore year in the NBA. Late in the fourth quarter against the San Antonio Spurs, the reigning Rookie of the Year took a moment to remind everyone of just how good of a passer and dunker he is with an alley-oop to himself.
 Morant was driving down the lane when, anticipating a lob to a teammate, Spurs guard DeMar Derozan decided to back off of Morant and cover a teammate cutting down the baseline. In doing so, Derozan forced the second-year player to make a split second decision that he was more than prepared to deal with. Morant threw the ball off the glass, grabbed it in the air with both hands and then slammed it home.

What Nigeria will require from a focused and determined government will be enormous, and as I stated earlier, revolutionary. Gurus define leadership as the ability to take your followers to where they NEED, not want, to be - whether they like or understand why or not; in fact, taking them kicking and screaming when necessary. The kind of poverty I am talking about here is the type that has eroded the minds of millions of our people. Many just move around mindlessly every day. No work. No destination. Or maybe with the hope of running into someone to 'rag' - as in a rag day - for a few bucks. In time, these otherwise normal people fall into drug use, little crimes, and all sorts. Something needs to be done to actively reset the minds and lives of too many millions of our people. The government that will do that work must give everything of itself, and more. No time for luxuries. No time for even basics. Total, 100 per cent honesty. The actions to be taken to help these people may not even be democratic in nature. I recall comedian Michael Che saying he does not vote because he thinks that is such an important and technical duty and he wonders why anyone will trust him to perform such a duty. So, democracy and voting will not save these people, only a benevolent sacrificial leader/government can. These Nigerians I am talking about need fundamental help. The upside is that if they get the needed uplift, turnaround and positive revolution in their lives - including a new orientation towards more productivity and better choices - they will give so much back to their nation and the crawling or recessing GDP will grow in leaps and bounds. This is however a medium to long term idea that must however begin immediately.

BUTLER — Not every shot Eastside took in the third quarter went in. It just seemed that way.
 The Blazers, playing their first home game of the 2020-2021 season, dropped six bombs in a 24-point third quarter on Concordia Wednesday on the way to a 71-63 win.
 Eastside (4-1) was 8-of-10 in the third, and extended a two-point halftime lead to 12 at one juncture.
 Gabe Trevino led four Blazers in double figures with 22 points. Owen Willard had 14 while Santino Brewer and Hugh Henderson had 13 points each.
 “Our balance and our unselfishness is just tremendous,” Eastside coach Ryan Abbott said. “Hugh comes out of halftime and he hits one right away. Gabe gets one going down that lane, and there’s no doubt in my mind, nine times out of 10 he’s probably shooting or scoring on that, but he kicks it out to Hugh and we get another one.
 “What a great job by our guys. It’s a great way to go into Christmas, but we know we have a tough conference opponent coming in here Wednesday in West Noble who’s playing people great.”
 Henderson led the three-point barrage, hitting four in the quarter, all from different spots on the floor. Trevino and Willard added bombs of their own.
 Concordia (3-5), which also trailed by 12 points in the first quarter but managed to take the lead in the second, wasn’t finished however.
 In the fourth, freshman Ajani Washington, who had 18 points, scored on his team’s first two possessions of the fourth, and senior David Speckhard, who finished with 22, nailed a pair of threes, including one with 3 minutes, 55 seconds left.
 That cut the deficit to just five points, 62-57 as Eastside got a little rattled, turning the ball over on three straight possessions.
 Brewer helped right the ship, turning a Cadet miss into a fast break score the other way.
 Fouled on the play, he missed the free throw, but Trevino chased down the rebound, was fouled, and made 1-of-2 with 3:18 to go.
 Trevino added two more single free throws before Washington hit a three with 50 seconds left. Willard made two tosses before Speckhard banked a three from the top of the key to make it a six-point game. Eastside added two more single free throws to close out the win.
 Brewer scored twice on fast breaks and Willard hit two threes in the first as the Blazers jumped out to a 21-9 lead. Threes by Brandon Davis and Ed Mattox enabled Concordia to close to 23-17 by the end of the period.
 The Cadets ran off 10 straight points in the second, capped by Speckhard’s three from the key, to take a 27-23 lead. Eastside took the lead for good when Hayden Gardner knocked down a three of his own in the final 20 seconds of the half.
 “I’m a proud coach tonight. It was an ultimate team effort,” Abbott said. “Credit Concordia and coach (Phil) Brackmann. It was like their fourth game in five or six days.
 “The roller-coaster of emotions this year has put on us; we were excited to play Lakeland and then we get disappointed” with a COVID-19 cancellation. “We called Edon, and we get disappointed” (again due to COVID.
 “It’s a tremendous win for us, and it helps us going forward.”
 Concordia 9th 43,
 Eastside JV 33
 Ben Bentz had 16 points and Sam Eggold added 11 as the Concordia freshmen team defeated Eastside’s reserve team. Concordia’s reserve team played in a tournament earlier in the day.
 Kyle Yoder had 18 points for Eastside while Clayton Minnick added nine.

It's safe to say the lush, utterly romantic "Sylvie's Love" is nothing less than a milestone in the history of African American cinema. Urbane, smart and heart-wrenching, the Sundance favorite, premiering this week on Amazon Prime, is the equivalent of what "Crazy Rich Asians" achieved in casting a positive light on a vastly underserved market of American minorities. And in the process creating a potential crossover hit exceeding far beyond its target audience. In other words, you don't need to be Black to melt in the presence of a dreamy, star-crossed romance in which writer-director Eugene Ashe reimagines a mid-century America where a young Black woman can realize all of her Mary Richards-type dreams.      All that's missing is the tossing of the blue, knit beret high into the brisk Minneapolis breeze. In fact, I found it impossible not to think of Mary Tyler Moore's iconic trailblazer while watching Tessa Thompson's Black counterpart, Sylvie Johnson, effortlessly defy racial barriers in 1960s New York City, while ascending in an industry thoroughly dominated by white males. Revisionist history, yes, but also a fantasy you so wish were true in the months leading up to the enactment of 1964's Civil Rights Act. That aspect of "Sylvie's Love" alone would be enough to sustain, but Ashe (a distant relation to tennis great, Arthur Ashe), deepens Sylvie's story by providing her with a hunky jazz musician to fall in and out of love repeatedly with over an eventful six-year period from 1957 to 1963.      He's played by former NFL defensive star Nnamdi Asomugha (husband of actress Kerry Washington), and his dreamy Robert is just what the love doctor ordered in lighting a fire in Sylvie's flame-resistant loins. But as Taylor Swift sings in her fabulous tune, "The 1," Ashe is mindful that the greatest loves of all time are over now. And so it is for Robert and Sylvie, as they chase their respective dreams to the detriment of a romance that never seems to work for both at the same time. She's engaged, he's got a long-term gig in Paris; and on and on it goes as they continually cross paths without ever finding the right moment to make love happen. Ashe renders it achingly, and yes, a little too predictable, but if you're a fan of Douglas Sirk's Technicolor romances "Magnificent Obsession" and "All that Heaven Allows," you're in for an eye- popping treat.      Ashe follows the Sirk playbook to a T, unashamed to ladle on the corn as well as swanky glitz. It's dazzling and just a little bit intoxicating. But it's the fabulous Ms. Thompson who keeps you glued with yet another of her high- caliber turns. This one is even more outstanding because Ashe's script doesn't always serve her well in a story that often feels underwritten, and worse, unimaginative. At times, I found the dialogue so predictable, I was uttering the next line to myself far before the words left the mouths of his actors.      What the script lacks in gravitas and surprises, is easily compensated by the candy-colored sets and evocative Technicolor backdrops of a city - and restless hearts - that never sleep. Normally, I turn my nose to melodrama, but Ashe renders it so charmingly you can forgive the clunky lines and preposterous coincidences in which characters unrealistically stumble into each other in halls, street corners and, yes, Detroit auto factories. Because of that, "Sylvie's Love" seldom clears the modest heights it sets for itself. Other than Thompson and Aja Naomi King as Sylvie's civil-rights activist buddy and romantic confidant, the ensemble is surprisingly flat. That includes Asomugha, one of the film's producers, whose acting skills aren't nearly as fluent as his shutdown of the NFL's best wide receivers. To say his readings are clunky is being generous. But God is he a stud; and for the film's target female audience, Asomugha more than fits the sexual fantasy bill.      To his credit, he also sells his character's joys of sax in convincing musical performances overdubbed by dexterous pros. And speaking of music, the film is glorious in its liberal use of jazz favorites, some sung by such diverse golden voices as Doris Day, Nancy Wilson and Diahann Carol, all of whom receive tributes in the final credits.      As a recording artist turned filmmaker, Ashe is clearly making the most of an opportunity to marry his two favorite artistic passions, movies and music. In an alluring display on flash and swoon, he proudly wears his heart on his sleeve. But his soulfulness and his love of love is written all over him.   Al Alexander may be reached at alexandercritica@aol.com.      "Sylvie's Love"   Cast includes Tessa Thompson, Nnamdi Asomugha, Aja Naomi King, Eva Longoria and Rege-Jean Page. Premiers Dec. 23 on Amazon Prime.   (PG-13 for smoking and some sexual content.)   Grade: B+

MADISON TWP. -- John and Monica Kastel had been feeling the squeeze of rising rents for years before it all came to a head recently.
   
 The Kastels operate the Madison Farmers Market, which sets up every Saturday morning, May through October, at the corner of Treat Street and U.S. 223.
   
 The farmers market is a fixture at the corner and has been for years. It's place to shop local, pick up some produce on your way to a weekend at the lake or the destination of a morning day trip.
   
 Unfortunately, the Kastels have seen the number of vendors shrink year after year.
   
 There's a surprising amount of costs associated with operating the farmers market. The Kastels have to rent the parking lot. They also have to purchase liability insurance and permits from the township.
   
 Last year, the couple paid $3,800 in total, with $2,000 going toward rent.
   
 The Kastels rent out individual, 10 foot by 10 foot spaces in the parking lot to vendors.
   
 "I just want to break even," John said.
   
 However, as their costs increased, so did the costs for individual vendor rents. This past season a vendor had to pay $125 for a space.
   
 In its heyday, the Madison Farmers Market had up to 70 vendors.
   
 There's a festival-like feel to Saturday mornings.The Marine Corps sets up a booth and plays the National Anthem. Live music and entertainment added a little something extra. John remembers one morning where a young yodeling girl drew a packed crowd.
   
 Now, the farmers market sees maybe half the amount of vendors. There's a consistent group, about 20 or 25, that set up every week, but the Kastels say it's hard to get more due to the increase in rent.
   
 It's especially hard for craft vendors to commit to a space for a season. Unlike produce sellers, who tend to sell out each week, people shop the crafts.
   
 Kathy and Mike Wyandt of Tecumseh know the struggle. The two have been a part of the farmers market for the last 15 years. Kathy sells handmade crocheted items like kitchen towels and scarves. Her products get looks each week, but it might be a couple weeks before a customer pulls the trigger on a purchase.
   
 Strong produce vendors bring more people to the market which in turn helps craft vendors. Much like when rent increases, there is a ripple effect when vendors fall off. The coronavirus pandemic didn't help matters this year, either.
   
 The property is owned by ProMedica. Diane Gibbs, director of acute care communications, said the property was donated to ProMedica in 2018. The donor manages the property.
   
 Gibbs said rent for 2019 was $2,000. In 2020, they knocked it down to $1,400 due to COVID-19.
   
 Believing the farmers market would have to find a new location for the coming year, Mike penned a letter to the editor in the Dec. 6 edition of The Daily Telegram. The letter was part grievance and part call out to the community, hoping someone would know of a new location for the farmers market.
   
 "He wrote the letter because it had been bothering him because where were we going to go?" Kathy said.
   
 But Gibbs said rent had not been discussed for 2021 before the letter in the paper and there had been no talks at all with the organizers until after the letter published.
   
 Adrian City Commissioner Lad Strayer reached out to the farmers market about having them downtown. It would have been a return home of sorts; the Madison Farmers Market began downtown in 1967.
   
 The group moved out of Adrian after they ran out of room. John was appreciative of Strayer's willingness to help, but downtown still doesn't have the room their market needs.
   
 Mike's letter kicked resulted in other people posting on social media about the situation.
   
 "The letter lit the bonfire," he said. "A lot of people got discouraged."
   
 ProMedica and the Kastels worked out a deal the same week. ProMedica will charge $400 for rent in 2021.
   
 "This farmer's (sic) market and others in the county support our goals to address the social determinants of health through local access to fresh produce," ProMedica said in a statement. "… we welcome farmer market participation in the Lenawee Health Network and collaborative grant opportunities to shape the strategic direction taken to accomplish this goal."
   
 It was a sigh of relief for the Madison Farmers Market. You just can't beat the location and visibility of U.S. 223.
   
 It's close enough to the border that vendors and customers come up from Ohio. A group from Sylvania that visits Hidden Lake Gardens every year always stops.
   
 The farmers market and the Family Kitchen Restaurant benefit from each other, too. Restaurant patrons tend to go to the farmers markets and vice versa.
   
 "We're bringing in traffic that is helping them, and they're helping us," John said.
   
 Even better, the Kastels can reduce individual rents. They hope it entices new vendors to take a chance and the return of old friends.
   
 "I think it'll get us more," Monica said.
   
 This article has been updated. The updated version states that ProMedica took control of the property in 2019 after it was donated the year prior, is managed by the donor and that ProMedica charged $2,000 for rent in 2019 and $1,400 in 2020.
   
 Further, it is stated there had been no communication between ProMedica and the farmers market organizers prior to a letter to the editor in The Daily Telegram, that people posted on social media about the situation and that the two parties worked out a deal for $400 rent in 2021.

 # Pardons in killings of Iraqi civilians stir angry response
 Eric Tucker
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Washington_ — The courtroom monitors carried the image of a smiling 9-year- old boy as his father pleaded for the punishment of four U.S. government contractors convicted in shootings that killed that child and more than a dozen other Iraqi civilians.
 “What’s the difference,” Mohammad Kinani al-Razzaq asked a Washington judge at an emotional 2015 sentencing hearing, “between these criminals and terrorists?”
 The shootings of civilians by Blackwater employees at a crowded Baghdad traffic circle in September 2007 prompted an international outcry, left a reputational black eye on U.S. operations at the height of the Iraq war and put the government on the defensive over its use of private contractors in military zones. The resulting criminal prosecutions spanned years in Washington but came to an abrupt end Tuesday when President Donald Trump pardoned the convicted contractors, an act that human rights activists and some Iraqis decried as a miscarriage of justice.
 The news comes at a delicate moment for the Iraqi leadership, which is trying to balance growing calls by some Iraqi factions for a complete U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq with what they see as the need for a more gradual drawdown.
 “The infamous Blackwater company killed Iraqi citizens at Nisoor Square. Today we heard they were released upon personal order by President Trump, as if they don’t care for the spilled Iraqi blood,” said Saleh Abed, a Baghdad resident walking in the square.
 The United Nations’ Human Rights office said Wednesday that it was “deeply concerned” by the pardons, which it said “contributes to impunity and has the effect of emboldening others to commit such crimes in the future.” The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said the pardons “did not take into account the seriousness of the crime committed,” and that it would urge the U.S. to reconsider.
 Al-Razzaq, the father of the slain boy, told the BBC that the pardon decision “broke my life again.”
 Lawyers for the contractors, who had aggressively defended the men for more than a decade, offered a different take.
 They have long asserted that the shooting began only after the men were ambushed by gunfire from insurgents and then shot back in defense. They have pointed to problems with the prosecution – the first indictment was dismissed by a judge – and argued that the trial that ended with their convictions was tainted by false testimony and withheld evidence.
 “Paul Slough and his colleagues didn’t deserve to spend one minute in prison,” said Brian Heberlig, a lawyer for one of the four pardoned defendants. “I am overwhelmed with emotion at this fantastic news.”
 Though the circumstances of the shooting have long been contested, there is no question the Sept. 16, 2007, episode – which began after the contractors were ordered to create a safe evacuation route after a car bomb explosion – was a low point for U.S.-Iraqi relations, coming just years after the Abu Ghraib torture scandal.
 The FBI and Congress opened investigations, and the State Department – which used the Blackwater firm to provide security for diplomats – ordered a review of practices. The guards would later be charged in the deaths of 14 civilians, including women and children, in what U.S. prosecutors said was a wild, unprovoked attack by sniper fire, machine guns and grenade launchers against unarmed Iraqis.
 Robert Ford, who served as a U.S. diplomat in Iraq over five years, met with the widows and other relatives of the victims after the killings, handing out envelopes of money in compensation and formal U.S. apologies – though without admitting guilt since investigations were ongoing.
 “It was one of the very worst occasions I can remember in my time” in Iraq, said Ford, who teaches at Yale University. “That was just horrible. We had killed these people’s relatives and they were still terribly grieving.”
 The widows mostly took the envelopes silently. Some of the adult male relatives of those killed spoke up, bitterly. “How could you do this? We must have justice,” Ford recounted in an interview Wednesday.
 Adding to the angry fallout among Iraqis was the involvement of Blackwater, a security firm founded by Erik Prince, a former Navy SEAL who is a Trump ally and brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
 The company had already developed an unfavorable reputation for acting with impunity, its guards frequently accused of firing shots at the slightest pretext, including to clear their way in traffic.
 A review of Blackwater’s own incident reports in 2007 by House Democrats found Blackwater contractors reported they engaged in 195 “escalation of force” shootings over the preceding two years – with Blackwater reporting its guards shooting first more than 80% of the time.
 The 2007 killings in the Baghdad traffic circle were among many attacks, large and small, hitting civilians that served to turn even some initial Iraqi supporters of Saddam Hussein’s overthrow against Americans. In 2005, for instance, Marines were accused of killing 24 unarmed men, women and children in the western town of Haditha in anger over a car bomb attack. U.S. military prosecutions in those killings ended with no jail sentences.
 The case against the Blackwater guards ping-ponged across courts in Washington, with a federal appeals court at one point overturning the first- degree murder conviction of one defendant, Nicholas Slatten, and sharply reducing the prison sentences of the three others. All four were in prison when the pardons were issued.
 The guards defiantly asserted their innocence at their 2015 sentencing hearing, with Slough stating that he felt “utterly betrayed by the same government I served honorably.” Another defendant, Dustin Heard, said he could “not say in all honesty to the court that I did anything wrong.”
 The judge rejected that characterization.
 Besides the legal impact, there could potentially be diplomatic and strategic consequences as well as Iraq assesses the U.S. military presence there.
 In Iraq, said Ford, the former diplomat, the pardons will “necessarily give some ammunition to those who say get the Americans out now.”

New Zealand’s government was able to get a handle on the pandemic via strict measures.


--DocBreak--
"
 As I sit here reflecting on how much COVID-19 has changed all of our lives, I wonder if the pandemic, as it usually is the case, is trying to teach us all something.
 I hate wearing the mask. I hate how I can't get in my car and go see my grandchildren. I hate how I can't interact with my friends. I hate how so many are losing loved ones, their livelihoods. In short, I absolutely hate what this virus has done to our world.
 But, as with many tragedies and awful experiences, there is usually a lesson to be learned if we so choose to learn the lesson.
 Society has been taking a nose-dive sort of speak on compassion, selflessness, respect and gratitude for some time now. There is so much greed, anger and judging all around us. Families are falling apart left and right due to differences of opinion on many issues. Seldom do we see families taking walks together, taking a ride or even eating dinner together.
 Maybe it is time we take a pause, quit complaining and look inward for ways to make the best of this situation. Maybe we need to make some changes. What if the hidden message is that we need to take advantage of this dire time and step up and be compassionate, non-judgmental, kind and reflect on our actions.
 We are being forced to stay in with our loved ones. All under one roof for long periods of times. Taxing maybe, but a chance to rebuild relationships. Maybe this will heal wounds and bring everyone closer together as it should be.
 There are people out there right now who need that extra hand. Even if we don't have the extra cash to share, we can bake, make something or cook for someone in need. Maybe we can shovel someone's walk, pick up groceries for an older person or just be nice and neighborly.
 COVID is a wake-up call. Our divisive ways are poisonous. It leads to more of the same. Take a look inward and make those hard changes to be a better person. Take care of each other and be safe.

 # Parents pardoned in 2009 ‘balloon boy’ hoax
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Denver_ — A couple convicted of criminal charges in the so-called balloon boy hoax that fascinated the country more than a decade ago were pardoned Wednesday by the governor of Colorado.
 Richard and Mayumi Heene reported their 6-year-old son had floated away in an homemade UFO-shaped silver helium balloon in 2009.
 Dozens of emergency responders and two Colorado National Guard helicopters scrambled to save the boy as video footage of the enormous balloon floating far above the ground made national news.
 But the child was never on the balloon, and he was later found unharmed at his home in Fort Collins, about 60 miles north of Denver. Authorities said the Heenes staged the ordeal to get publicity for reality TV shows they were trying to pitch.
 Eleven years later, couple has now “paid the price in the eyes of the public” and shouldn’t have to be dragged down by a criminal record for the rest of their lives, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement Wednesday.
 “We are all ready to move past the spectacle from a decade ago,” said Polis, a first-term Democrat.
 Richard Heene served a month in jail after pleading guilty to a felony count of attempting to influence a public servant, and Mayumi Heene was jailed for 20 days for filing a false report. They were also ordered to pay $36,000 in restitution.
 The couple told ABC News last year that it wasn’t a hoax because they truly feared their son could have been aboard the balloon when they called for help.
 Polis also issued 16 other pardons and four commutations.

Police said the caller, who has not been identified, reported that a man had been sitting in his SUV for an extended period, repeatedly turning his engine on and off.
 Ginther identified the officer as Adam Coy, and said that after reviewing Coy's actions during the Tuesday morning incident, he determined the officer should be fired from the police department.
 "After further review of the incident, today, I'm calling for the immediate termination of Coy ... who failed on two directives: not turning on his body- worn camera, and failure to offer aid after the shooting and not rendering aid," Ginther said.
 CNN has reached out to the Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge No. 9 which represents the officer.
 Columbus Director of Public Safety Ned Pettus said that, by law, Coy is a public employee and entitled to due process, which he said would begin as soon as possible. Coy has been stripped of his badge and gun pending an independent investigation into the shooting.
 Authorities are in the beginning stages of an investigation that has been turned over to Ohio Attorney General and the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
 In a statement Wednesday, Yost said investigators "will conduct a complete, independent and expert investigation -- a search for the truth."
 "What we have now is an incomplete record," Yost said in a statement. "We must allow the record to be completed and the evidence to be gathered. Only the truth -- the whole truth and nothing else -- will result in justice."
 Officials have said Coy and another officer who responded to the call were equipped with body cameras but did not turn them on until after the shooting. A function of the body-worn cameras' technology used by Columbus police provides a 60-second look back but records no audio, officials said, adding that the officer's camera ultimately captured video of the shooting but no audio.

 # Prosecutors, law enforcement urge community be on lookout for COVID vaccine scams
 Jarrad Daniel Saffren
 Burlington County Times
 South Jersey prosecutors want residents to remain vigilant against potential COVID-19 vaccination scams.
 If you get a call asking for money to secure a better spot in line, hang up the phone. If you get a call or email soliciting personal information, hang up the phone or delete the email. And if a guy walks up to your door offering a "vaccine," close the door and call the cops.
 These and other COVID-19 vaccine scams have been identified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as potential threats, according to the Camden County Prosecutor's Office. In addition to such "payment schemes" and "telemarketer calls," as the office described them, other recorded scams include Medicare fraud and identity theft.
 As a resident, you should remain on the lookout for these scams, said Acting Camden County Prosecutor Jill Mayer. And if you see them, you should call your local police department, added Tom Gilbert, the chief of detectives for the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office.
 Mayer and Gilbert did not point to any specific incidents on a local level. They just want people to understand that these threats are out there, and possible, especially as the COVID-19 vaccination rollout continues in New Jersey.
 State hospital systems administered the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine to more than 2,000 healthcare workers last week. Additional NJ hospital systems began administering the first dose of the Moderna vaccine to their employees earlier this week. The Garden State remains in Phase 1A of its vaccination rollout, which is focusing on healthcare workers and long-term care residents and staff members.
 “A lot of people, especially those in high-risk groups, are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel with the news of an approved vaccine, and that excitement could make them susceptible to scams,” said Mayer. “We know many families want their loved ones to get the vaccine as soon as possible, but please make sure to take the necessary steps to ensure what you’re signing up for is legitimate.”
 Mayer advised residents to contact their personal physicians and county health departments with questions about the vaccination process. Gilbert recommended following the announcements from Gov. Murphy and his administration, as well as reports from local, trustworthy media outlets.
 "Government agencies will not call you to ask for money to secure your spot, ask for personal identifying information, or offer vaccines by going door-to- door," said Mayer's press release.
 "We encourage people if they have any suspicion at all, don’t pursue it," added Gilbert. "And anything they have contact with, make sure it’s legitimate."

Jesus Christ.
 What can I give Him,
 Poor as I am? —
 If I were a Shepherd
 I would bring a lamb;
 If I were a Wise Man
 I would do my part, —
 Yet what I can I give Him, —
 Give my heart.
 These several verses from the hymn “In the Bleak Midwinter” struck me as fitting for us this Christmas. For too many this year has indeed been bleak in many ways. But this hymn reminds us that Jesus, out of infinite love for us and to save us, chose to come in bleak circumstances as well.
 Also, as the hymn says “What can I give him?” We cannot ‘give’ God anything, but we can give to others in Jesus’ name.
 I am so overwhelmed by the generosity we have seen at Good Samaritan this year, and especially recently. So many have given in so many ways to see to it that others who may have less, materially, are fed and cared for in this ‘bleak midwinter’. The food pantry and adopt-a-family have received many blessings that we in can pass on to others in our community. This truly is, as Linus would say, “What Christmas is all about.”
 Thank you for caring for your neighbors.
 Blessings during the 12 days of Christmas!

Dillan got a new heart in June, in the middle of a pandemic. Despite masks and infection fears, this 12-year-old beat it all.
 But Denise, a Mom of 5 boys, knows what had to happen in order for her family to stay whole.
 "You realize that somebody else has to lose, to..." Denise's voice trails off as she looks over at her son. "Sorry...someone has to make that decision, so it's very emotional. It can be very emotional."
 "The fact that everyday, families really step up to the plate, and think about others in their worst possible time, it's very powerful, and it really helps, I think, cement some of that Christmas message," Rick says.
 This will be Dillan's first Christmas since the surgery, but he's already looking ahead to the spring baseball season.
 And though he's still waiting for his body to give the green light to play, his heart is already in the game.
 "We're very blessed and very thankful."

Often times they had to transfer to a bus on another route when they got downtown. For most, it was either the Winnie and Avenue O bus or the West Market and Avenue M bus.
 One time I sat next to Lucy, and she asked me if I’d like to see how she had decorated her house for Christmas. I transferred with her, and when we got to her house, it was a small-frame, one-bedroom home that fronted the alley. There was a big house in front. Back where Lucy’s house was, there was a small building that housed a toilet. It was attached to the city plumbing but not too many years before had been an outhouse.
 The walls in Lucy’s house were papered with funny papers. She liked the colors, and she liked the happy stories the drawings told. I wondered why her landlord hadn’t put in real wallpaper.
 Lucy had a handmade Christmas tree on a table, and the ornaments were made out of construction paper and held together with flour glue that she had cooked on her two-burner gas stove.
 On the overhang of the porch, she had all kinds of greenery that she had salvaged from trash piles or cut off of the trees in the backyard. There were some shiny, colored glass ornaments and tinsel that she had bought from one of the downtown dime stores, but not a lot.

Jim Shirk was just 17 when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. The now-94-year-old recently recounted he was aboard an LST—or tank landing ship. LSTs supported amphibious operations by carrying tanks, cargo and troops directly to shore with no docks or piers. Shirk was a gunner. On his second or third trip, Shirk’s LST was either hit or struck a mine.
 According to Marcella, her husband of 63 years “remembers very little after that. When he really did wake up he was in Norfolk, Vir., back in the states. He recuperated for seven to eight months. He was pronounced dead actually—twice,” she found out from her brother-in-law.
 “He never would talk about it,” Marcella said. She found out through family members that he received a Purple Heart because he was “wounded pretty badly with his back.”
 Jim described awakening back in the United States.
 “When I woke up, I didn’t realize where I was. I’d come in and out [of consciousness],” he said. “When we were over there laying on the beach we’d need a shot [of liquor] to calm us down until they could get a medical ship in to move us to Norfolk.”
 Shirk received three other medals during his WWII service.
 After the fire, the medals were gone. However, when the Malibu Navy League found out Jim’s story, they arranged to get his Purple Heart reawarded. A small ceremony was recently held with a new medal presented to the veteran.
 “It was very gratifying, to say the least, that they returned it,” the 94-year-old remarked. “They were so enthused about doing it.”

Collins is the first Tulsa player to win any of the current on-field performance awards and becomes the school’s first FWAA All-American since offensive lineman Jerry Ostroski in 1991. He was selected among five finalists that included Coastal Carolina defensive end Tarron Jackson, Iowa defensive tackle Daviyon Nixon, Notre Dame linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah and Alabama cornerback Patrick Surtain II.
 The FWAA All-America Committee selected Collins as this year’s Bronko Nagurski Trophy recipient after voting from the entire membership. The official presentation of the award by the FWAA and the Charlotte Touchdown Club, the award’s sponsor, will occur at a later date.
 At 6-4, 260 pounds, Collins has become one of the most dynamic defenders in college football. He has totaled 54 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss for minus-49 yards, four sacks for minus-25 yards, four interceptions — including two that he returned for touchdowns, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery, as well as one safety, in eight games. Two of Collins’ interceptions were game-clinchers, including a pickoff against No. 19 SMU that ended any possible final scoring drive for the Mustangs and his pick-6 in overtime against Tulane that he took 96 yards for the game-winning score.
 Collins was unanimously chosen as the American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year, becoming the first player in league history to earn unanimous player-of-the-year honors, and also receiving unanimous first-team all-AAC accolades.
 “I’m honored and blessed to receive the Bronko Nagurski Trophy. It’s awe- inspiring to be mentioned in the same breath as Bronko Nagurski and the many great players who won this award before me,” said Collins. “I’m so thankful for this honor and for all the people who have put me in this position — my family, coaches, teammates and fan base. I can’t thank the coaching staff and my teammates enough. Coach G (defensive coordinator Joe Gillespie) and Coach Monty (head coach Philip Montgomery) have pushed me, and the absolute best teammates have helped make me better each day.”
 Collins joins a long and impressive list of Nagurski winners, including Bradley Chubb (2017), Aaron Donald (2013), Luke Kuechly (2012), Ndamukong Suh (2009), Terrell Suggs (2002), Champ Bailey (1998), Charles Woodson (1997) and Warren Sapp (1994). Last year’s winner was Ohio State defensive end Chase Young.Collins and Temple linebacker Tyler Matakevich, the 2015 recipient, are the only two Nagurski winners from a Group of Five school, both hailing from institutions in the American Athletic Conference.

 Often, I will go back in my mind and try to place myself into historical events and periods of time -- with the hope of trying to realize what the participants actually felt -- and I imagine how I would respond. It's a game I play every now and then.
 There is a period in history that absolutely fascinates me. It centers around Jesus' birth. To be honest, Christ's entire earthly life -- death, burial, resurrection, ascension and birth of the early church -- intrigues me greatly, but the beginning is what is timely now, as we prepare for Christmas once again.
 Exhausted from a seven-day trek originating in Nazareth where Joseph lived, he and his very pregnant teenage fiancee, Mary, finally arrive in Bethlehem; the ancestral birthplace of his relative King David to be enrolled by the Roman government in the census.
 Joseph just wants to sit down. Walking for seven days has his feet swollen and covered with dust, and Mary, although not a complainer, has been uncomfortable, especially riding their donkey for this extended journey.
 As the contractions start, her betrothed becomes anxious and is desperately trying to find suitable shelter. Bethlehem is teaming with Joseph's relatives. They have all descended on this little village and there is absolutely no comfortable lodging for them anywhere.
 Finally, he finds a family that will allow them to stay in their stable below with the livestock. At least the animals will provide added warmth to the cool night air.
 Then, at just the right moment, in the fullness of time ... this young girl delivers her firstborn, bonds with her son, wraps him up with swaddling clothes and lays him down in the feeding trough.
 Mary knows who this child is and so does her soon-to-be husband. She just gave birth to the King of kings and the Lord of lords. And yet, they quietly observe this moment in time and try to capture the weight and reverence of what just happened and of what will be.
 Just outside of town, there are shepherds guarding their sheep. As they try to keep awake, the sky lights up with a radiance they have never seen before. If they were asleep, they are awake now ... and they witness the sights and sounds of myriads of angels announcing the Good News of great joy that will be for them and all of humanity.
 These angelic messengers, with great jubilation, exclaim that this very night in their village a Savior has been born who is Christ the Lord. They are blown away by this display of magnificence and they hurry off to see this Wonder of Wonders a short distance away from their resting place. When they arrive at the manger, the parents of Jesus are told what the shepherds witnessed with their eyes, ears and hearts. Mary and Joseph listen intently and marvel as everyone gazes in awe at the miracle lying before them.
 The coming of the Messiah to the world was proclaimed and foretold over many centuries. This Immanuel hope was a generational longing. Old Testament prophesy was at last fulfilled by sending God's promise in the flesh to the earth. This little baby would change everything.
  _\"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.\" Isaiah 9: 6-7 NIV_
 We have the perspective of looking back. Those eyewitnesses that first Christmas evening were experiencing in real time the moment when the very hand of God lovingly reached into our world and extended physically to us His only Son.
 I hope this year at Christmas, all of us will be able to carve out some quiet time, so we can appreciate a bit more deeply the awe and reverence that the first participants felt in that little corner of the world ... as the cool evening air softly caressed the face of our Savior; that night when God became a man.

The next day I made a dash to Lagos, and as part of my itinerary, I had to make a dash to Ogba, Ikeja; a suburb. I had lived near there before relocating to Abuja and my idea was that Ogba is not particularly one of the poorest areas of Lagos. But when I got to the place, opposite Excellence Hotel, my heart sank. Since I stopped living in Lagos in 2001, things have only gone worse for this area and the people. I saw very deprived people, many with broken limbs. Others with obvious drug problems. The majority of people living in this area had stress written all over their faces. I saw broken dreams. I was reminded of why most Nigerians have given up on themselves and the prospects of living in a good country. The plaza I visited itself was dirty and run down. Yet there were Nigerians trying to make ends meet as entrepreneurs there. A gift shop here, a lawyer's chambers there. Grime everywhere. This urban area is not renewing itself. Ok, there was a six-story building by the junction, the best effort perhaps at urban renewal. I imagined the six-story rather being swallowed up by the rundown surroundings. Beyond the dilapidation of infrastructure really, is the dilapidation and devaluation of the people. Our people.

Before the ball is snapped, Brady walks up to identify the Mike linebacker, given that he's actually up on the line of scrimmage. This is absolutely meant to try and confuse the quarterback and on third down, the Falcons actually only bring four as three players drop into coverage. McCoy takes a linebacker with him on a delay, offering Brady a checkdown option in the flat but Brady does an excellent job stepping up and sees Evans wide open on a crossing route near the left hash after Atlanta loses him in zone coverage and has a defensive tackle covering that spot. That's not going to work and Evans is able to make the catch and then some, adding on some extra YAC for a 26-yard pickup.

 # Retailers taking extra steps to this holiday season to lessen virus’ spread
 Joyce M. Rosenberg
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _New York_ – Dan Marshall’s toy store should be crowded this time of the year with parents and grandparents buying gifts and children trying out games. Instead, only a handful of customers are in Mischief Toy Store at any time, and their visits are short and efficient.
 Yet while the coronavirus outbreak is giving Marshall his most challenging holiday season in over 20 years in business, his priority is keeping everyone — customers and all the workers in his family-run business — safe. So, he’s encouraging shoppers to buy from the Mischief Toy Store website or order by phone rather than at the St. Paul, Minnesota, shop. He also arranges for virtual shopping trips, where customers can see the store’s merchandise online.
 “We are in the weird position of wanting people to shop, but not wanting them to come into the store,” Marshall says.
 Retailers are taking extraordinary steps this holiday season in hopes of lessening the spread of the virus. The steps go beyond limiting the number of people in a store; besides encouraging online shopping, many owners are setting up appointments before and after hours for private shopping trips. Owners ask customers in their stores to limit the amount of time they spend there. Curbside pickup, delivery and shipping are standard operating procedure.
 All this is in addition to state and local restrictions on how many people can be in a store at a time. Some owners, Marshall included, have decided to set a limit even where there are no government orders. He’s allowing 10 people in at once, a third of what he’d expect during the holiday season.
 Small and independent retailers have been among the hardest-hit businesses during the pandemic. Not only are they contending with government restrictions, but many consumers worried about catching the virus don’t want to shop in person. The plunge in revenue has forced more than 8,600 stores to close this year, according to Coresight Research, a market research firm that specializes in retailing.
 Consumers reluctance was reflected in a 1.1% drop in retail sales in November, according to the Commerce Department.
 The changes in stores this year can be dramatic or subtle. In toy stores, usually children can plow through bins of small toys and pick out what they want. There’s a cluster of small items at the checkout counter that parents buy on impulse, extending the shopping trip a bit and adding to the retailer’s bottom line. Not this year; Marshall, whose revenue is likely to be down 30% this year, is emphasizing safety over profits.
 “We wanted to expedite that process and keep people moving,” Marshall says. But, he adds, “it’s not how a toy store wants to do business.”
 Emily and John Murray have gone further, deciding last month to close their baby products store and operate entirely online even though Michigan is allowing retailers to remain open.
 “We felt it was the right thing to do,” Emily Murray says.
 The Murrays expected Modern Natural Baby to suffer a massive revenue drop. Instead, sales have been up 15% from a year go, in part because the Murrays are doing two live videos a day showcasing their merchandise. Almost all their customers are opting for curbside pickup at the store in Ferndale.
 The Murrays believe customers’ response is due to the fact parents are worried about being in stores, and their desire to support small businesses.
 “We were worried about upsetting customers, but the response was overwhelmingly positive,” she says.
 Store owners are also helping customers shop more efficiently. At Perch, a gift and home furnishings store in San Francisco, a growing number of customers are taking advantage of private shopping appointments. Owner Zoel Fages is reserving the last two hours of each day for appointments and gives shoppers a questionnaire to fill out ahead of time so he can set aside gift suggestions before they arrive.
 When customers arrive at EcoHome Fine Gifts & Home Decor in Atlanta, a sign welcomes them but also asks them to be considerate because other shoppers would like to enter the store. And they’re paying attention, staying usually 20 to 30 minutes rather than the hour to hour and a-half owner Lawton Hall expects for this time of the year.
 “I’m pleasantly surprised at how cooperative people have been,” Hall says. The store is currently serving about 15 to 20 people at a time, half the usual number.
 They also don’t seem to mind that some of the usual amenities the store offers, like free coffee, aren’t available. Many aren’t in the mood to chat with employees.
 “Most people just want to get out and not be distracted,” Hall says. His revenue is better than he expected, perhaps because many customers don’t eat at restaurants. They have more money to spend on gifts or on their homes.
 Most of Sadie Cherney’s customers would rather shop online than come to her three Clothes Mentor shops in the Greenville, South Carolina, area. On Black Friday, she counted 82 people in her stores at the busiest time of the day, a fifth of what she’s seen in previous years. Revenue is down about a third from normal.
 While online shopping is helping Cherney’s stores survive, it can take staffers 40 hours a week to keep the site fresh. Clothes Mentor, a franchise retailer, buys and sells gently used clothing. So each garment is unique, and the site has thousands of images to upload and then, when the clothes have sold, be taken down.
 “The work feels like running six stores, not three,” Cherney says.
 “I am definitely fatiguing. I want to be resilient, but it’s getting a little harder,” Cherney says.

Leave it to Tom Hanks to enliven a dry, dusty Western like "News of the World." Without him, the latest effort from Brit writer-director Paul Greengrass would be as empty and decrepit as a West Texas ghost town. With him, humanity and energy pour forth from an actor who's cornered the market on genial characters with an unbending resolve. Folks like Capt. Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a 60-year-old Civil War vet visited far too often by the aftermath of death, both in his capacity as a Confederate commander and a devoted husband. You can see the toll taken in every crevice of a weather-beaten face peeking from beneath a scraggly gray beard.      Having traded in his single saber for an arsenal of words, the vagabond widower futilely attempts to remain one step ahead of his sorrow by crisscrossing his native Texas spreading the word of seasoned journalists much like an evangelical priest propagating the Gospel of John. He's a newsreader, an unsung figure of the Ol' West as important to the pioneers as an undertaker in times of cholera. To watch Hanks' Captain Kidd work a room of farmers, ranchers and their kin delivering recitations culled from the pages of big- city newspapers is analogous with a preacher stirring a congregation full of amens.      They, like us, hang on every mellifluously delivered sentence, each filled with vital information about everything from government programs to the building of railroads that will expedite deliveries to market. He's the equivalent of today's TV news anchors, only he's performing live and in the flesh at 10 cents per head. And what his customers get in return is invaluable. And that would be a connection extending far beyond their backwater borders. Greengrass, a filmmaker with an unabashed populist streak, clearly thinks what these readers did in unifying a diverse nation have gone unnoticed too long.      In that respect, "News of the World" delivers its hosannas with grace and eloquence. Where it falters is in the creaky story he and co-writer Luke Davies hitch to it in adapting Paulette Jiles' novel. And it's a tale as old as a 1961 episode of "Gunsmoke" in which Marshall Dillion happens upon a young, orphaned girl alone and frightened on the prairie; a young lady who would become hopelessly attached to her ersatz father figure. That's the basic, barebones plot of "News of the World." From the moment Captain Kidd lays eyes on the feral child (outstanding newcomer Helena Zengel), you know where they're bound.      The only affront to the happiness of the pseudo father and daughter is a series of deadly obstacles, both human and meteorological, that must be conquered through undeterred will and shared resourcefulness. In other words, a road movie creakily constructed with a series of poorly connected set pieces involving ornery hombres, runaway wagons and a trio of creepy pedophiles. Individually, these episodes vary in effectiveness from lame to thrilling. But the one constant is Hanks, whose folksy charm is as valuable as all that gold in them thar hills. And he couldn't hope for a finer co-star than 10-year-old Zengel, a second coming of Tatum O'Neal in both form and spunk.      The script demands her Johanna, a lost child having laid witness to the murders of first her German born parents and later the Native American couple who took her in, serve solely as the salvation of a reluctant Kidd, who has no choice but to care for the recalcitrant imp and make her part of his traveling show. Their road to bountiful is deeply worn and littered with cliches, but Hanks and Zengel lessen the ruts via heart-tugging chemistry and faultless performances. You enjoy their company and cling to the hope they will survive their perilous journey. But Greengrass missteps in keeping Johanna largely mute due to the prescribed language difference between Johanna, who speaks only German and Comanche, and a guardian familiar only with the king's English. Yet, that doesn't stop Kidd from prattling on, uttering expository dialogue to a child who has no clue what he's saying but acts as if she does.      It's a minor flaw, but it's glaring. And when added to the movie's relentless predictability, it robs "News of the World" of hordes of potential drama. Still, it's Hanks, and he's spectacular, drawing on his previous portrayals of Fred Rogers, Captain Phillips (also directed by Greengrass) and, yes, Sheriff Woody to create a winning composite of a wholesome good guy forever adhering to his moral compass. It's really something quite lovely and surprisingly affecting. Or as I like to say, a three-hankie Hanks.      Al Alexander may be reached at alexandercritica@aol.com.      "News of the World"   Cast includes Tom Hanks, Helena Zengel, Michael Angelo Covino, Fred Hechinger and Thomas Francis Murphy. (In theaters, where open, beginning Dec. 25).   (PG-13 for thematic material, some language, disturbing images and violence.)   Grade: B

As I sit here reflecting on how much COVID-19 has changed all of our lives, I wonder if the pandemic, as it usually is the case, is trying to teach us all something.
   
 I hate wearing the mask. I hate how I can't get in my car and go see my grandchildren. I hate how I can't interact with my friends. I hate how so many are losing loved ones, their livelihoods. In short, I absolutely hate what this virus has done to our world.
   
 But, as with many tragedies and awful experiences, there is usually a lesson to be learned if we so choose to learn the lesson.
   
 Society has been taking a nose-dive sort of speak on compassion, selflessness, respect and gratitude for some time now. There is so much greed, anger and judging all around us. Families are falling apart left and right due to differences of opinion on many issues. Seldom do we see families taking walks together, taking a ride or even eating dinner together.
   
 Maybe it is time we take a pause, quit complaining and look inward for ways to make the best of this situation. Maybe we need to make some changes. What if the hidden message is that we need to take advantage of this dire time and step up and be compassionate, non-judgmental, kind and reflect on our actions.
   
 We are being forced to stay in with our loved ones. All under one roof for long periods of times. Taxing maybe, but a chance to rebuild relationships. Maybe this will heal wounds and bring everyone closer together as it should be.
   
 There are people out there right now who need that extra hand. Even if we don't have the extra cash to share, we can bake, make something or cook for someone in need. Maybe we can shovel someone's walk, pick up groceries for an older person or just be nice and neighborly.
   
 COVID is a wake-up call. Our divisive ways are poisonous. It leads to more of the same. Take a look inward and make those hard changes to be a better person. Take care of each other and be safe.

 # Opinion: Duggan plan for water shutoffs is a political tactic
 Roslyn Bouier, Linda Campbell, Nicole Small and Beulah Walker
 View Comments
 Recently, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan announced a moratorium on water shutoffs that will expire in 2022. The mayor’s announcement was supported by Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, former appointee of Duggan as the director of the city of Detroit Health Department. El-Sayed claims that he influenced the mayor to permanently end water shutoffs in Detroit once and for all.
 It is critical to hold those accountable that make false statements that are misleading to some of our most vulnerable communities. Duggan’s water plan does not end water shutoffs permanently, stop exorbitant water fees or help pay the unaffordable past due balances.
 Duggan’s plan puts Detroiters that are in crisis on life support once again. In 2017, when Duggan was running for reelection, he addressed the drainage fee crisis, which subjected thousands of Detroit churches and residential homes to water shutoffs by implementing a suspension until the following year. Today, drainage fees are still the primary cause of unaffordable water bills for Detroiters. In 2020, Detroiters are still being sold recycled political tactics, not policy solutions.

 This is why Detroit activists and leaders cannot afford to allow political opportunists to publicize false hope without holding the person(s) accountable, because Detroiters quality of life and health depends on it.
 According to El-Sayed, his influence on Duggan to end water shutoffs permanently came with a price for El-Sayed to endorse Duggan for reelection, which brings into question the real purpose behind the plan. Using a moratorium on water shutoffs as a political bargaining chip in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic is unconscionable and morally reprehensible.
 Those who have worked on water affordability doubt that this deal will result in a water affordability plan that is sustainable and meets the needs of Detroiters.
 If Detroiters have learned anything in the recent past it’s that we cannot count on politicians to save us. We must organize, build power and put forth our own solutions. One such example is the proposed water affordability plan presented to Detroit City Council years ago by former Councilwoman JoAnn Watson and recently brought forth by We the People of Detroit.
 This plan has been approved as a charter revision by the Detroit City Charter Commission. Other progressive policies focused on affordable housing, transit, economic development and broadband access to name a few, have been developed by residents alongside activist but are soundly opposed by the current administration. No wonder the Duggan-El-Sayed proposal has been met with widespread skepticism.
 El-Sayed claims his decision to endorse Mayor Duggan was to end water shutoffs permanently. His endorsement, supported by what he deemed, “real grassroots” activism, is a distraction often used by nonresidents seeking to take leadership in our community. We understand the value of building allies to advance our policies. However, we draw the line when it results in undermining our voice, co-opting our leadership and splintering our relationships within our community.
