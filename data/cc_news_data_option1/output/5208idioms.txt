The Gurugram health department on Friday said they would identify at least 250 sites by the month end to administer the Covid-19 vaccine as and when it becomes available. The district will also have 500 vaccination officers who will be deployed at the sites.


  Dr MP Singh, who was recently appointed as Gurugram's district immunisation officer, said, "We have completed registering nearly 50,000 frontline workers in the public and private sector across the district. They will be vaccinated at designated session sites, which are yet to be identified. Each site will administer the vaccine to not more than 100, or not more than 200 individuals, depending on the size and feasibility of the location."


  While the district's 19 urban and primary healthcare centres are likely to be included in this list, additional sites have been sought from the education and labour departments.


  "Schools, colleges, community centres and offices and all such locations may be used in addition to our own clinics and dispensaries," said Singh.


   


   


  The sites will be opened when the district fixes timelines and finalises the list of those who will receive the jab. About 40 doctors are being trained to administer the vaccine.


  Each site will have four vaccination officers in addition to the person trained to administer the shot.


  Two would be police officials who will check the healthworkers' identification on entry, their registration papers and manage their data on the Co-Win app -- a digital platform which will be a repository of information for the management of Covid-19 vaccination in the coming months


  "A third officer, either a civil defence volunteer or a home guard, will be for crowd control while a fourth officer from the women and child development department will monitor the vaccine recipient to check for adverse effects," Singh said. "We can proceed with site identification only once we know the staff availablility. We have already conveyed to the district administration our requirement."


  At a meeting of the district vaccination task force on Friday, health department officials met with representatives from the police, education, labour and women and child development departments, who are slated to assist with the upcoming immunisation drive against Covid-19.


  Meanwhile, the district reported 152 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday (up from 108 on the previous day), along with 106 new recoveries and two new deaths. The district tested 4122 samples tested on Friday, of which 3.6 percent were positive for Covid-19. This marks the fourth consecutive day that Gurugram's daily test-positivity rate has remained below the five percent mark. The district's total Covid-19 tally stands at 55487 cases, of which 1718 cases are active.

  The high court said it was too soon to rule on the legality of Trump's plan because it's not yet clear how many people he would seek to exclude and whether the division of House seats would be affected.

In order to gain maximum market share and achieve the predicted $1 billion per year from this drug, Pfizer needed to develop an oral form that proved safe for pediatric use. But Trovan had never been tested on children, and in animal models it caused liver toxicity and joint damage. In addition, bacterial meningitis was rare in the U.S. There were thus not enough children suffering from it for a convincing clinical trial. However, as luck would have it, a ready pool of children suffering from the disease had suddenly, coincidentally, and inexplicably become available—in Africa!

The Delhi Police's Economic Offences Wing on Friday said it has arrested the chief finance officer of Zenica Cars India Pvt Ltd, a firm involved in the dealership of high-end cars, for allegedly duping banks to the tune of ₹300 crore by forging the company's balance sheets.
 This is the third arrest in this case that was registered in 2018, a legal action that was followed up by the police arresting the company's directors, father-son duo Rashpal Singh Todd and Mandhir Singh Todd, in September that year. The Todds, who are British citizens of Indian origin, were arrested from the IGI Airport in Delhi just as they were preparing to board a flight to the United Kingdom, allegedly on the pretext of attending a relative's wedding there.
 The latest arrest, of the firm's chief finance officer Vaibhav Sharma, took place on Thursday, said OP Mishra, joint commissioner of EOW.
 Sharma, however, denied that he was arrested. "I received anticipatory bail from the Delhi High Court on Thursday. So, I couldn't have been arrested," said Sharma, refusing to comment on the allegations.
 But Mishra said that the anticipatory bail only saved Sharma from going to jail. "He was technically and formally arrested and then let off," said Mishra.
 Ajay Verma, a criminal lawyer at Delhi high court, said that an arrest after an anticipatory bail is a mere formality and the accused is released after furnishing a bond.
 Sharing the background of the case, Mishra said that in 2007, the Todds had approached the Bahadurshah Zafar Marg branch of HDFC Bank for financial assistance. "They had been availing term loan, cash credit facility and bank guarantee since 2013," said the officer.
 Till March 2018, the firm was operating as per the law, but they began defaulting after that, said the officer. In June 2018, during an inspection, the HDFC Bank found that the balance sheets had been manipulated to dupe the bank of ₹102 crore, Mishra added. He said that other banks too had been duped in a similar fashion, taking the total cheated amount to ₹300 crore. The alleged fraud also involved selling demo cars without no-objection certificates and misappropriating loan amounts.
 Detailing Sharma's role, Mishra said that he had forged the statement of a bank and also showed that the company was suffering losses for four years although their balance sheets showed profits.
 The Todd father-son duo have already been chargesheeted in the case.
 The Zenica group claims to have established India's first and largest Audi dealership in NCR and have showrooms of high-end cars across Delhi and Gurugram.

This state formation process coincided with and was partly facilitated by the so-called Scramble for Africa by the European colonial powers, with Emperor Menelik II (who ruled from 1889 to 1913) expanding his kingdom into what is today the southern half of the country, conquering the Oromos (the demographic plurality of the country), the Somalis, and dozens of other ethnic groups currently making up Ethiopia. Menelik identified himself as a member of the Amhara, a national group whose kings ruled over Abyssinia (Northern Ethiopia) for centuries, outmaneuvering the other key Abyssinian group, the Tigraway.

As COVID-19 cases surge higher in the local area, it is important that we not give in to fatigue and frustration.
 It is understandable that, after nearly a year of hearing about the coronavirus, we tire of the virus. We want to go back to our normal lives, as they were before COVID reared its ugly head.
 We at The DPA share the exasperation of many of you in regard to the virus. We would like nothing more than for the virus to vanish, as if it were never there.
 But, that’s not the case. And with the Christmas holiday coming up next week, it has become more important than ever that we remain cognizant of the virus and the actions we can take to limit its spread.
 The difficult reality is that the more we act against the coronavirus, the more normal life will be. If we socially distance, wear face coverings and limit our gatherings, sporting events will be safe to continue, schools can reopen and places of business will feel comfortable staying open.
 Now is not the time to give in to the desire to ignore this virus. The end is in sight.
 The proverbial light at the end of the tunnel is now present, as it has been announced that one COVID vaccine has been delivered to Tennessee and another is nearing FDA emergency use authorization.
 If things go as expected, our fight against the virus is no longer a marathon. It is now a sprint and the finish line is drawing near.
 So we urge everyone — wear your masks, wash your hands, limit your gatherings and remain home if you feel sick.
 Despite the growing number of COVID cases, this is not a call for government intervention. The time for that was in the spring and that time has now passed.
 Now is the time for individual responsibility. A major part of living in a free country is accepting personal responsibility for your actions.
 Now is not the time to point fingers, blame others or wonder “what if.”
 In the Bible in John 8:7, Jesus instructs those around Him, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone...”
 We are called not to cast blame, but instead to look inward, at ourselves. Act the way you feel is responsible, while keeping the health and safety of others in mind. If we all act responsibly and focus on doing what we need to do to combat this virus, we will win and we will likely win more quickly than we may think.
 We must remember that it starts not with government and not with others, but with ourselves. Act responsibly, keep the safety tips in mind and we will get through this.
 We at The DPA wish everyone a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kobe Bryant’s widow has denounced a lawsuit from her mother claiming she is owed years of pay for working as an unpaid assistant and support promised by the basketball legend, who was killed in a helicopter crash in January. Vanessa Bryant issued a statement Thursday saying her mother was trying to “extort a financial windfall,” the Los Angeles Times reported. The 48-page lawsuit filed by Sofia Urbieta Laine, 68, claims Kobe Bryant “promised to take care” of her for life. “Unfortunately, Kobe Bryant’s promise did not see the light of day as he is now deceased and Vanessa Bryant took each and every step she could to void and cancel all of Kobe’s promises,” the lawsuit claims, asserting that Vanessa Bryant never intended to honor those wishes. Kobe Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others died Jan. 26 when their helicopter crashed in the hills of Calabasas. Financial experts estimate Vanessa Bryant inherited control of an estate worth up to $600 million, the Times said. Vanessa Bryant’s statement said she and her husband allowed her mother to live for free in one of their properties on the tony Newport Beach coast but never promised her anything or discouraged her from providing for herself. “She was a grandmother who was supported by me and her son-in-law at my request,” Vanessa Bryant said. “She now wants to back charge me $96 per hour for supposedly working 12 hours a day for 18 years for watching her grandchildren. In reality, she only occasionally babysat my older girls when they were toddlers.” Vanessa Bryant said that earlier this year she began looking for a new home for her mother and that her mother gave a TV interview in which she claimed she was being forced out of her home and to return a luxury...

Slowly though, this drawer filled up with an especially gaudy collection of flotsam: sparkly dresses, capes, plastic beads, fake flowers, hideous wigs, and netting underskirts with sagging elastic at the waistline. It was the kind of place where ripped '30s gowns, fabric faded like pressed flowers, were squished in on top of metallic American Apparel leggings that made one look like a scaly, slightly rainbow-tinted lizard. Value and age mattered much less than potential. All I cared about was the effect, merrily veering between garments befitting teenage ravers and slightly down at heel stars of the silent screen.

“If you don't score, you don't win .I think I don't want to push the responsibility on the players. This is also a little bit to do with your own confidence and may be because our preparation was not long. If you are out of football for six months and then come back and hit the ground running, it is not easy. So, I don't want to blame my players. But we must be focused and take confidence. I want us to start scoring more goals even in training. We need to do that more and that confidence will come,” explained László.

“This is a terrible case. Someone was on the run, he obviously has no fixed abode and he is given bail. That is unacceptable. Even though we respect their independence, there is no way a person who was on the run and was arrested during a shootout can then get bail. Even if they say the prosecutor did not oppose bail, the judge should have noticed this, this whole case raises eyebrows,” said Minister Ziyambi.

DENVER (AP) — The federal government has told Colorado it will receive thousands fewer doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine in a second shipment than originally expected, although the state anticipates the numbers contained in future shipments will be standardized, Colorado's health department says. Colorado had expected to receive 56,550 Pfizer doses on Friday after getting an initial 46,800 doses on Monday. Operation Warp Speed officials informed the state that Colorado’s next Pfizer allocation is expected to be 39,780 doses, a difference of 16,720, the Department of Health and Environment said in a statement. Health officials say the impact is lessened because each vaccine vial provides six doses rather than five as originally anticipated — allowing a 20% increase in vaccinations. With the second allocation, 25,740 vials will go to a pharmacy partnership to support vaccinations at skilled nursing facilities. The remaining 14,040 are being assigned to health care providers. Federal officials say that moving forward, Colorado will get similar shipments each week. The state still expects getting 95,600 Moderna vaccine doses next week. Other states have been told to expect fewer doses of the Pfizer vaccine in its second week of distribution, prompting worries about potential delays in shots for health care workers and long-term care residents.

The board should ensure ARDA adopts best farming practices with a view to increase production and productivity on all its estates.

But he has a problem in calling the ‘other’ roles he’s done as those of ‘hero’s best friend’. “I find them fun. They are the heart and soul of the film. There are so many actors who are doing it now. I have said no to many such opportunities before but only because they were not written well. Earlier, they never wrote such roles. They wrote those characters as a shadow of the hero and shadows don’t react while now writers make protagonists and the other characters who also drive the film with the protagonist,” subtly hinting that he also has an issue with the phrase ‘hero’ and wants them to be addressed as protagonist/antagonist.” Read 'Unpaused' review here.

Patrick Hannus of RDP has a major car accident several years ago and had to learn to adapt to a new way of living."You can feel sorry for yourself or embrace it and life goes on," he explained. "At the time of my accident I had two children, 4 and 2, and I was working three jobs, but because I was home recovering, I got to see my children grow and be a part of it. Later I became a soccer coach and was involved in the figure skating club, I was on the governing board at school - all these things I never would have had a chance to do prior to the accident. So there are no regrets there.
 Hannus has always loved kids and finding a way to give back to the community. "I used to be a Boy Scout and always volunteered, plus I enjoy working with kids. If you don’t have the volunteers, the kids have nothing and its important for them to have these activities. People who have the opportunity to partake should. I personally enjoy it. Growing up in a large family, we didn’t have the means to join activities, and it makes you appreciate a lot of other things that others don’t. If I can help, even just to be there, I want to."
 All his life, Hannus has been "observing" and taking notes, whether they be on paper, a napkin, coasters, or a scrap of paper. At the start of the pandemic, he decided to go through these notes and turn them into a book for his children and extended family. "I would write down anything in the moment and then go back to it, and each time I would write longer versions of the life’s observations," he explained. "I've always considered it to be a work in progress. Some pieces have been revised 10-15 times, others changed form completely, and still others have inspired other writings."
 His love for writing goes back to his Champlain College days where he took an English class where they did free-flow writing. "Forget mistakes – just write and don’t break the flow," he said of the instructions he received. "That’s what I do. Sometimes I have a thought or an idea but not the full story, so it just sits there, and one day it will come by itself. Other times, I add just a few lines and it just flowed by itself."

I often found dressing up safest at home anyway. More than safe. Exhilarating. With my bedroom door closed, I was free to experiment, flinging on turquoise feather hats and opera gloves, daubing eye shadow up to my brows, trying on dress after dress until the floor around me was a sea of turquoise rayon, white lace, and watery washed silk. I pulled things on and off, tied my belts in knots, staggered across my carpet in platform heels, and generally made a fuss (and a mess) until I felt like I'd satisfied this particular, itching urge.
