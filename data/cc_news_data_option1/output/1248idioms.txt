Then the MIAA put a hold on their season, and all of Volpone’s officials found themselves on the sidelines indefinitely. Volpone’s work now turns to sending her team US Lacrosse online courses, encouraging them to watch games on video, and keeping their spirits high.
 “I’ve been just keeping in touch with my officials and seeing how they’re doing,” said Volpone. “You know, a lot of us put our heart and soul into getting ready for the season. It’s not just a job for us. We absolutely love being out there.”
 With Wednesday’s announcement that Massachusetts schools will remain closed until May 4, many fear that the high school season might also be lost. Volpone is taking a lot of hope out of the MIAA’s recent statements about modifying the season.
 “I love how the MIAA is holding on to the fact that they’re going to try to make this happen,” said Volpone. “Whether it ends up being a four-week season, a three-week season, a two-week season. I just love how they just haven’t said, ‘You know what, we’re going to cancel it all.’ So that’s one positive to hold on to.”
 Volpone isn’t alone in longing to be out on a lacrosse field, watching one of the most competitive sports in the Cape Ann. She can just look out her window at her daughter, Paige, a senior midfielder for the girls team at Triton Regional, who is constantly working on her skills in their yard in the event the spring high school season ever gets off the ground.
 “It’s tough,” said Volpone of her daughter, who is committed to play for Division 2 University of Virginia – College at Wise. “This is her senior year, and she’s chomping at the bit to get out there. She’s also a captain, so she’s really trying to balance the leadership and not letting her teammates see how upset she is for not being out there.”
 Both Volpones hold out hope that come May, their calendars will be filled with lacrosse again. The officials Volpone works with feel the same.
 “As hard as being an official is, the corps of officials that we have love being out there,” said Volpone. “It’s not really that we’re missing it because we’re not getting paid. We’re missing it because it’s part of our lifestyle. We want to be out there just as much as players on the coaches do.”

“We’re not looking at vocal ability," says Dixon. "We’re just looking at a positive message, so no matter your age, your color, your sex, your national origin, or your language barrier! You can sign language it, we’ll put that in the message because at the end of the day we want to reach all, teach all, and spread a positive message to all.”

"Grazie anche al pressing della Lega che ha ascoltato il grido di dolore di migliaia di imprese del comparto, il governo ha riconosciuto la vendita libera di prodotti florovivaistici, semi e fertilizzanti, accogliendo così una nostra proposta di buonsenso”. Ad informarne è il deputato della Lega Flavio Di Muro.      “Un primo passo, seppur tardivo – spiega Di Muro -, nel supporto di un comparto strategico per il made in Italy, ma non sufficiente. Le imprese del settore, in particolare per quelle del distretto florovivaistico del Ponente ligure, hanno assoluto bisogno di un’iniezione immediata di liquidità, a ristoro in primis del mancato export, che per le imprese locali rappresenta circa l’80% del giro d’affari, e delle produzioni distrutte, a causa della chiusura delle esportazioni e l’annullamento delle fiere internazionali. Non solo: occorrono coperture per le spese energetiche sostenute, anche durante questo forzato stop, spese ingentissime nel caso del mantenimento in funzione delle serre, dei costi per i dipendenti, oggi impiegati nello smaltimento dei fiori ormai merce da macero, e delle spese per il conferimento di fiori e piante come rifiuti speciali in discarica, l’azzeramento delle rate dei contributi agricoli. Con le perdite registrate in questo periodo, quello di maggiore fatturato delle imprese rispetto a tutto il resto dell’anno, le circa 5 mila aziende del distretto, a oggi, non hanno neppure la liquidità sufficiente all’acquisto dei successivi reimpianti per continuare la produzione. La Lega continuerà a fare sentire la voce dei floricoltori liguri e italiani perché il governo dia un supporto concreto e massiccio da tradursi in misure mirate per un comparto di eccellenza internazionale della nostra agricoltura e della nostra bilancia commerciale".

Those are things you can reasonably say we weren’t quite prepared for. However, if you’re like me, there are some smaller, less important things you could have prepared for simply by not procrastinating.
 For instance, our dog Skipper could sure use a trip to the groomer right now. One of his nicknames we call him is “Fuzzy” because if he hasn’t had a haircut in a while, he certainly gets fuzzy. And as the temperatures start to heat up now that we’re in spring, I’m sure he’d appreciate a much thinner coat. But of course, the groomers have had to close their doors because of the coronavirus.
 Also, I am way past due a visit to the eye doctor. I’ve needed a new pair of glasses for going on a decade now and I am also down to my last pair of contacts. It might be possible to have a few more contacts ordered, but with my eyes the way they are I could certainly use an exam. But those types of appointments also aren’t being taken now because of the coronavirus.
 No, I couldn’t have guessed that these types of services would have to suspend their operations. But I could have taken my dog to be groomed several weeks ago and I could have had my eyes examined several months ago. So while it might be easy to blame the governor’s mandates as well as COVID-19, I’m way more at fault for being a procrastinator.
 All of us have probably been guilty at some point, though, of putting things off until tomorrow. We have all told ourselves at one time or another that we will do tomorrow what we could have done today. “Tomorrow” must be the longest day of the week considering how many things we plan to do then.

I believe we are doing the right thing by staying away from big crowds and staying away from close contact as much as possible. But the coronavirus outbreak certainly has changed our lifestyles and routines dramatically in a matter of only a couple of weeks.
 Classes and spring sports for our students have been suspended for the time being. We can’t dine in at our favorite restaurants or do any shopping besides grabbing the basic necessities. And for many of us, we have either found ourselves without a job or have been working from home.
 A few select folks may have been prepared for this type of environment, but the majority of us couldn’t have foreseen this world we are currently living in. We all assume our kids will have a school or daycare to attend, and that we’d have more than a day’s notice before our businesses are shut down.

“I actually just sent that out to all my officials, just give me a little boost,” she said. “I know how much we all miss being out there.”
 The COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed the college lacrosse season, which was already a blow for Volpone’s officials. The college seasons got underway in February, and by the second week in March, were hitting their stride with Division 1, 2 and 3 all finally in full action. Then seemingly within hours, all college action came to a full stop.
 “(Cancelations) were trickling in day by day with some conferences,” said Volpone. “Some conferences were holding out and waiting, and some were canceling all together. But then (March 12) all the conferences and the NCAA had canceled, and college lacrosse was done for the season.”
 While the college seasons were coming to a halt, Volpone started to think about ways to get college players involved in officiating. There was still hope for a high school season, and there is always a need for new officials.
 “We were hoping to take advantage of some of those college athletes who are now not on the field to do some officiating classes and some observations of some high school games,” said Volpone. “This was before all this was in the works before all the high school schedules were altered as well.”

The demand within the global market for craft vodka has been rising on account of the growing number of breweries. The presence of traditional breweries in several regions across the world has played a major role in the growth of the craft vodka market. The manufacture of craft vodka has emerged as an art form in several regions. Moreover, craft vodka has gained popularity at a stellar rate across the globe, and people have welcomed this form of liquor with open arms. Hence, there is little doubt the fact that the global craft vodka market would accumulate voluminous revenues in the years to follow.

WITH most Noosa restaurants and cafes now closed, Noosaville-based food wholesalers Markris have had to react quickly.
 The company, which has been operating in the region for more than 25 years, normally supplies directly to restaurants and cafes.
 Now they’re delivering to residents and operational manager Nick Cole said Markris had plenty of stock in the warehouse that needed to be sold.
 “We have flour, butter, eggs … we have got a lot of big tins of products and everything the supermarkets used to have, but in bulk,” he said.
 “We’re trying to get the word out that we’re open.”
 While there’s not a whole lot of demand for a 10kg tin of pineapple, Mr Cole said there were plenty of other items on offer via the website.
 “The general public has access to our complete range which is online at mymarkris.com.au.”
 Without their main source of income – restaurants – last week was a tough one for the family-owned business and they had to let some staff go.
 But they are hoping that with the support of the public, they can keep their doors open and re-hire workers.
 “Our aim is to try to be able to get those staff members back on board … there’s a lot going on at the moment.”
 Mr Cole said his parents, the owners of the business, Neil and Jane Cole, returned from Sri Lanka, and “they are in quarantine at the moment”.
 “There’s definitely no one here (on site) working who’s been overseas recently.
 “We’ve been on the phone, making these big business decisions. It’s hard for them.”
 Mr Cole said anyone interested in placing an order should call 5449 9466 and it will be packed and delivered to your door within 48 hours.

Larkey said that the most important thing will be that his players continue working out and lifting weights to stay in shape and not lose all the work they have been putting in in the offseason. To do that, Larkey and his coaching staff have been sending their players different workout plans and videos to do while school and practices are canceled.
 “They are not all going to go above and beyond, that’s for sure,” he said of his players. “But for the ones that do, they are going to be in better shape and then they’ll be ahead of the others and that person will be at an advantage.”
 Though Larkey said he has been warning his players that the cancellation of spring football was likely to happen at some point, he doesn’t know how or if this outbreak may affect the 2020 football season.
 “It’s a whole new thing to everybody,” he said. “Nobody really knows what to expect because when you start shutting down professional sports, when you start canceling tournaments, New York is shut down, Vegas is shut down, then you know something bad is about to happen but that’s the thing, we don’t really know what.
 “People can speculate all they want. We may get in there and they tell us our season has been shortened down to half a season and we’ll go straight into our districts and then into the playoffs or it may just pass over and it may be fine some time in July or August. That’s the thing, though, nobody knows.”

France staged its largest evacuation of coronavirus patients to date from hospitals in the hard-hit east on Sunday, increasing efforts to free up intensive care units as officials warned of an influx of serious cases in the coming days.
 Two specially equipped high-speed trains carried 36 patients from Mulhouse and Nancy to hospitals along France's western coast, where the outbreak has been limited so far.
 Dozens of hospital workers, flanked by police and soldiers standing guard, spent hours installing four patients in each wagon in an operation that began before dawn.
 "We have to free up beds, it's absolutely crucial.... We're still seeing an increase in patient numbers," said Francois Brun, head of emergency services at the regional hospital in nearby Metz.
 The evacuations came as Germany sent a military plane for the first time to Strasbourg to transport two patients to a hospital in Ulm.
 Around 80 French patients have been hospitalised in Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg, European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin told France Inter radio.
 France has been evacuating dozens from the east over the past week, hoping to stay ahead of a crisis that Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has warned will only worsen over the next fortnight.
 Overall, more than 4,600 coronavirus patients are in intensive care in France, many with severe respiratory problems requiring ventilators that officials worry could soon be in short supply.
 Philippe said at the weekend the government was racing to have 14,000 intensive care beds available soon, compared with just 5,000 before the outbreak began in January.
 On Sunday the national health service reported 292 new coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 2,606.
 The daily toll was below the 319 deaths reported on Saturday, but the figures include only deaths reported in hospitals, and not at retirement homes or assisted-living facilities.
 Also Sunday the housing ministry announced it would commandeer 5,000 hotel beds to house homeless people during the crisis.
 \- 'Battle is only starting' -
 Officials fear the virus may spread quickly at the country's roughly 7,000 retirement homes, and several have already announced dozens of deaths.
 Those figures will start to be reported this week, the prime minister said on Sunday, warning that "the battle is only starting."
 "This war will probably be won on the basis of intensive care beds, and our ability to strategically use all our intensive care resources on the national level," said Marie-Odile Saillard, director of the Metz regional hospital.
 National health service chief Jerome Salomon said 359 more people were placed in intensive care on Sunday.
 "This is the most important number to keep track of because it reflects the strength of the epidemic," he said at his daily briefing.
 The government has ordered a billion face masks, mainly from China, but warned that surging worldwide demand for protective equipment means they might not arrive soon enough for medical workers currently facing shortages.
 A plane from China carrying 5.5 million masks and other equipment arrived in Paris on Sunday, though the government has admitted it needs 40 million masks each week for health workers alone as the outbreak rages.
 "Our first Boeing 777 Cargo has just landed at #ParisCDG with close to 100 tonnes of medical equipment on board, including more than 5 million masks," Air France tweeted.
 France has been on lockdown since March 17 in a bid to limit the contagion, a situation it has extended until at least April 15.

With an unprecedented captive audience of three billion people in coronavirus lockdown virtual sports events are wooing fans after traditional live sports were shut down and public gatherings banned in many countries.
 Horse-racing, boxing, cycling, football and motor-racing chiefs are desperate to maintain their fanbase and are scrambling to provide a fix and maintain revenues.
 With stadiums closed and events such as the Tokyo Olympics and Euro 2020 postponed, organisers are generating advertising revenue by streaming virtual sports on YouTube, Facebook and Twitch or even broadcasting them on traditional television platforms.
 Sports is where the numbers are and fans denied real games are turning to live streaming, watching people play games, and taking part in those video games themselves.
 Italy's Mugello motorcycling circuit, which would have attracted 200,000 people for its MotoGP weekend on Sunday, may just have pulverised that figure with a live-streamed virtual race promoted as "The stay at home GP".
 Honda's world champion Marc Marquez came fifth as the globe's top riders sat uncomfortably on their sofas livestreaming from their living rooms.
 Alex Rins looked bored playing with his pet dog on his knee.
 Alex Marquez, younger brother of the world champion, won the race and asked jokingly "will the points count to the championship?".
 Millions of fans, credit cards at the ready, are expected to copy them after downloading the app.
 Old-school purists will be heartened by veteran Valentino Rossi's refusal to take part.
 The seven-time world champion said this week he was "cheering on the people of Brescia and Bergamo, those who usually cheer me on. It looks like a war zone," he said of his coronavirus-stricken region.
 "I have seen very bad images, we must hold on," he told Sky Italia, who will also broadcast the virtual race.
 \- 'And he's back from the dead here' -
 Formula One chiefs have also galvanised some of their drivers to grab their gaming controllers, racing a Virtual Bahrain Grand Prix which was abbreviated because of technical difficulties.
 Boxing legend Muhammad Ali, who died in 2016, was even back in action, beating Sonny Liston again on Friday in a virtual bout with 35,000 YouTube viewers.
 Ali will now meet the long retired Mike Tyson after he beat up George Foreman on Saturday.
 Racing-mad Britain comes to a standstill each year for the Grand National and with the courses all closed, broadcaster ITV will show a virtual race on April 4.
 The real race can be a dangerous lottery with horses and riders potentially suffering serious injuries in the many falls, but it makes millions for the bookies, who this time will run online betting for the field of 40 runners.
 "We use the latest CGI technology and algorithms and were ready to go ahead as a forerunner to the big race," said executive producer Rob McLoughlin.
 As with the boxing, there will also be a race of champions pitting the late Red Rum, who won the National three times in the 1970s, against defending champion Tiger Roll.
 Baseball staged a four-player video-game tournament called "MLB The Show" on Friday. It also suffered some technical problems before it was won by Amir Garrett, a Cincinnati Reds pitcher, who played at home wearing his team uniform.
 "A win's a win," said Garrett but he also said: "You've got to realise it's a video game."

Virginia Anne (Callahan) Jackson, 77, of East Sandwich, passed away peacefully, surrounded by family, on March 25, after a long illness. Ginny was born on August 11, 1942 in St. Louis MO, the second daughter of the late Thomas and Anne (Shea) Callahan, and raised in Springfield, MA. She received a B.A. at the Elms College, and worked as an elementary school teacher in the city of Springfield for most of her teaching career. Ginny married her childhood best friend, John Jackson, in 1968, and they moved around the country as Army orders dictated, then settled down, and raised their two daughters. They lived in Longmeadow, MA., until moving to East Sandwich in 1989. Ginny was funny and feisty and stubborn. She drove with both feet and felt speed limits were mostly a suggestion. She liked to read the end of a mystery novel first, and went on the scariest amusement park rides if her kids needed an adult-something they did not fully appreciate at the time. She sang along to the radio, preferred her Manhattan on the rocks, and could eat her body weight in sushi at Inaho, her favorite restaurant. She loved children and dogs, and was never happier than when her home was full of both. She loved to travel with her family, meet new people and experience new cultures and local cuisine. Ginny was predeceased by her sister, Mary Callahan, her son in law, Adam Bell, many family members and close friends, and her dogs; Dublin, Patches, Maggie and Abbey. A joyous reunion is expected, Irish Whiskey will be served. She is survived by her husband of 52 years, John Jackson of East Sandwich, her daughters, Mary Beth Jackson of East Sandwich and Anne Bell Luevano and her husband, Paul of Boston, MA., her in-laws; James Jackson of E. Longmeadow, MA, the Luevano family in Longwood, FL, and The Bell and Perry families, of Worcestershire, UK, her Flamingo family, and many close family members and friends around the world. Funeral arrangements will be planned at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be sent to help kids who didn't have the great gift of having someone like Ginny as mom, to: Child and Family Services, 3057 Acushnet Ave, New Bedford, MA 02745 "So long, and thanks for all the fish!"

President Donald Trump has extended emergency coronavirus restrictions for the United States where his top scientist warned up to 200,000 people could die, as Africa's biggest city readied to go into lockdown on Monday.
 The reassessment by Trump, who had previously said he wanted the country back to work in mid-April, came as Britain and hard-hit Italy warned measures to prevent the spread of the disease would be in place for months to come.
 COVID-19 has already killed almost 34,000 people worldwide, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University, with the number of confirmed cases nearing three-quarters of a million.
 As of Sunday, more than 3.38 billion people were asked or ordered to follow confinement measures, according to an AFP database, as the virus infects every sphere of life -- wiping out millions of jobs, postponing elections and clearing the sporting calendar.
 Trump warned that the US crisis, which has seen a doubling of infections in only two days, would contnue to get worse for some time.
 "The modelling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks," he said, accouncing an extension of social distancing guidelines until April 30.
 "Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won."
 The president was speaking after Anthony Fauci, who leads research into infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said he believed 100,000 to 200,000 Americans could die from the disease, and millions could be infected.
 Officials continued to sound the alarm over medical shortages, with some bemoaning a system that has states competing for desperately needed supplies.
 "We're bidding against one another," said Michigan's Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
 The human consequences of a shutdown that has seen huge chunks of the US economy grind to a halt were playing out at food banks in New York, where organizers say demand has exploded.
 "Before, there were 1.2 million people in New York who needed help for food. Now, there are three times as many," said Eric Ripert of City Harvest, a food rescue organization.
 \- Six months -
 Trump's re-evaluation of a back-to-normal timeline came as British officials said life may not return to usual for six months.
 The country's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said it would be several weeks before doctors could tell if the current lockdown had slowed the spread of the disease.
 "But we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living -- that would be quite dangerous. If we stop then, all of our efforts would be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak."
 She said measures to contain the virus would be reviewed every three weeks, "probably over the next six months" or even longer.
 In Italy, which has logged a third of global deaths, the government warned citizens should be ready for a "very long" lockdown that would only be lifted gradually, despite the economic hardship it was causing.
 "We are in a very long battle," said government medical adviser Luca Richeldi. "Through our behaviour, we save lives."
 Yet the strains on Italian society imposed by measures that might have seemed unimaginable just weeks ago are gradually starting to show.
 The starkest example came when armed police began guarding entrances to supermarkets in Sicily after reports of looting by people who could no longer afford food.
 \- Global divide -
 Africa's biggest city, Lagos, was due to join the global stay-at-home from Monday, with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari ordering a two-week lockdown.
 The measures also apply to the capital Abuja.
 Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with some 190 million people, has so far registered just 97 confirmed infections and one death from COVID-19, but testing has been limited.
 Officials have warned that the country risks seeing an "exponential" rise in cases unless contacts of suspected carriers are tracked down faster.
 Authorities in Lagos, a sprawling megacity of 20 million, had already closed schools, shut non-food shops and restricted gatherings to limit movement.
 Enforcing a total lockdown will be a mammoth challenge for authorities in a country where tens of millions live in dire poverty and rely on their daily earnings to survive.
 The same holds true for large parts of Africa.
 In Benin, President Patrice Talon said his country could not enforce public confinement because it lacks the "means of rich countries."
 Aid groups have warned that the coronavirus toll in the developed world could pale compared with the devastation it wreaks on defenceless populations in poor states and war zones such as Syria and Yemen.
 Three billion people around the world lack access to running water and soap, the most basic weapons of protection against the virus, according to UN experts.

Rugby Australia's alarming financial state heading into the coronavirus shutdown was revealed Monday with the organisation posting a near Aus$10 million (US$6.0 million) deficit, not helped by a hefty payment to the sacked Israel Folau.
 The 2019 numbers were released as the governing body struggles to navigate a way through the COVID-19-enforced halt to sport, and with players complaining of being locked out of critical talks about their future.
 RA said it was unable to produce a set of audited financial accounts due to uncertainty surrounding its business into the 2020 season and beyond as revenues dry up because of the pandemic.
 But after its annual general meeting it reported a provisional Aus$9.4 million operating deficit, compared to a Aus$5.4 million profit in 2018.
 Revenues are ordinarily hit in a World Cup year, with fewer home Tests, but expenditure also increased by Aus$6.6 million.
 Part of the extra spend was the undisclosed settlement with Folau, an ardent Christian and former poster boy of Australian rugby who was fired over homophobic social media posts.
 The two parties avoided a costly court battle over the legality of the sacking by reaching a mediated agreement in December.
 The governing body's perilous position comes with rugby on hold indefinitely after the Australian government put tough restrictions on public gatherings as it battles to contain the coronavirus.
 The country has so far confirmed more than 4,000 coronavirus cases, with 18 fatalities.
 Rugby Australia chairman Paul McLean said "significant cuts across the business" would be needed to keep the sport financially viable in the short term.
 Specific action was not outlined, although talks are underway to tap funds from the government and World Rugby.
 \- Executive pay slashed -
 Whether players will need to take pay cuts has yet to be decided, but chief executive Raelene Castle's salary has been halved and other senior executives are taking a 30 percent cut.
 "To put it simply, there is no way of knowing what damage this crisis will have on our game, or for how long it will continue to impact us," said McLean.
 "It has forced us to make some extremely difficult decisions, and there will be even harder decisions to come as we continue to navigate the implications of the virus on the game's finances."
 The organisation is set to lose broadcast rights money imminently with a proposed domestic tournament to replace the suspended Super Rugby competition shelved, and serious doubts about whether home Tests against Ireland and Fiji in July will take place.
 Ahead of the AGM, the Rugby Union Players' Association (RUPA) slammed the governing body for sidelining it on discussions about the future, complaining about "a vacuum of information".
 "While our colleagues in the other major football codes across Australia have been meeting with their governing bodies for weeks, RA has refused to share any information about the future financial direction of the game," said RUPA chief Justin Harrison.
 Castle said talks would begin with players on Tuesday.
 "I understand from their point of view that there is a level of frustration that they haven't had a deeper engagement earlier," she said.
 "But the reality is Rugby Australia didn't want to enter into those conversations until it had the chance to give them accurate information so we could enter into a solution-based scenario for the next three months."

Spurred by reports of boaters congregating on islands or sandbars in Charlotte County waterways, the county was about to close marinas and boat ramps. The idea — and it was not without merit — was to further limit groups congregating and possibly spreading the COVID-19 virus. The disease is seemingly extremely contagious and any health official or doctor worth his stethoscope has been telling people not to gather in bunches. Ten seemed was a popular ceiling for gatherings.
 But the boaters won out. Commissioners Bill Truex and Joe Tiseo led the charge to ban the ban, even though it didn’t take much convincing for other commissioners to jump on board.
 Citing concerns of commercial fishermen and the need for a way to release the tension and anxiety so many are feeling, commissioners decided to halt the ban just hours before it was to go into effect.
 The short-circuited ban would have also closed walking trails in the county. That too was rejected.
 In another move during Tuesday’s meeting, county commissioners decided to open up our roadways and neighborhoods to food trucks.

Funny story: firstly, special shout out to Eva, who did such an amazing job throughout not only this whole episode, but those vows, my goodness. She did an incredible job and it was a joy to watch her masterful work. But, in the middle of filming her coverage of the vows, as she’s getting emotional and delivering pure gold to the camera, _whoosh_ , a big fan turns on. ‘Cut!’ On to the next take... the room is silent, everyone captivated by her words, and then right in the meat and potatoes of the vows, _bam_! A picture frame falls off the back wall. ‘Cut!’ It was craziness. I think they even called ‘cut’ one other time to fix her hair. But again, to Eva’s credit, she handled it like a pro, laughed it off and nailed the next two takes.

A number of healthcare providers have been adopting CRM software solutions. For example, in April 2017, Microsoft partner Simient announced its partnership with Queensland’s Connected Care Program to deliver advanced healthcare services to seriously ill children, particularly those residing in remote and rural areas. Earlier, the healthcare providers relied heavily on excel spreadsheets and access databases, with records that offered a fragmented view of patient history. These ill-suited management systems could not effectively address the needs of complex cases. The new consolidated system, on the other hand, ensures appropriate delivery of care at the right time by leveraging Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Any healthcare professional with authority can access a child’s health record with a view to providing streamlined and effective case management.
