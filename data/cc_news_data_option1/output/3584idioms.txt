I still haven\u0027t returned to eating at restaurants even outside but have been thinking about it. So discovering what experts are saying about what to do when eating at a restaurant helps especially how to use your mask. After sanitizing your hands when sitting down and not going to the restroom to wash them, here\u0027s what to do when you remove your mask, “When you are eating at a restaurant, the last place you want to put the mask after you remove it is on the table.” The reason why, “COVID is transmitted via respiratory droplets, which can occur even when people are talking. So just having a simple conversation with your friend and family can cause droplets to land on and contaminate your mask.” It is suggested to put your mask in a paper bag.They also recommend wearing the mask the whole time before eating, then keep off until finishing meal. “Constantly putting the mask on and off between bites can actually increase the risk of spreading COVID, as you increase the possibility of spreading the virus from your mask to your hands and subsequently spreading it around.” Much more here.

Ellen DeGeneres is ready to talk about the past few months. Announcing the return of _The Ellen DeGeneres Show_ Tuesday, the talk show host indicated she will address the allegations of a "toxic" workplace and subsequent investigation on air. The hit daytime series will kick off its 18th season on Monday, Sept. 21, and DeGeneres revealed she would be back on the L.A. set without a live studio audience after the coronavirus pandemic prompted her to finish the previous season at home.
 The comedian said in a statement that she would be addressing the on-set drama of the last few months with her audience right away. "I can't wait to get back to work and back to our studio," DeGeneres said Tuesday. "And, yes, we're gonna talk about it." The upcoming season will be a star-studded one, featuring guests Tiffany Haddish, Alec Baldwin, Chrissy Teigen, Chris Rock and Orlando Bloom. DeGeneres' longtime DJ, Stephen "tWitch" Boss, will also guest host some of the upcoming episodes after being named a co-executive producer last month.
 The _Ellen_ shake-up began in July, when _Buzzfeed News_ published a report featuring stories from former and current employees of the NBC show who alleged they experienced racism, fear and intimidation working behind the scenes. Warner Bros. launched an internal investigation soon after, and fired executive producers Kevin Leman, Ed Glavin and Jonathan Norman in August following additional allegations that were made against the trio.
 DeGeneres previously apologized to her employees in a statement amid the investigation. "On day one of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that _TheEllen DeGeneres Show_ would be a place of happiness -- no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect," she wrote in a leaked internal memo in July. "Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it's the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show."
 Adding that she didn't know about the actions being taken in her name, DeGeneres prompted she was "committed" to ensuring it did not happen again. "I am so proud of the work we do and the fun and joy we all help put out in the world. I want everyone at home to love our show and I want everyone who makes it to love working on it," she concluded. "Again, I'm so sorry to anyone who didn't have that experience."

“We had all kinds of technical problems with Zoom and it didn’t work. So I decided, ‘OK, I’ll just go run an errand I need to run and come back real quick. and while I’m out, it started working. That’s just how it goes,” she said.
 That issues would occur with the communications of Monday’s meeting seems par for the course for O’Neal who has struggled to have this case have a stronger priority with Chilean authorities since a man who was accused of causing Hagan’s death was acquitted in a 2016 trial. That man — Domingo Cofre — was a security guard for the apartment where Hagan lived and is believed to have died on Sept. 5, 2014, a day before her body was found.
 O’Neal has said several times that she believes Cofre is, in fact, not the person who killed her daughter.
 As of last week, the pursuit to find the killer has resumed in earnest, and, while O’Neal said not much of significance resulted from Monday’s meeting, there was one part that is leaving her particularly encouraged.
 “If I understood them correctly, when I did ask them to invite the (United States’) FBI to, if nothing else, observe, they agreed to go through channels,” she said. “I told them, ‘Maybe they have a way of testing things that you don’t know about,’ but the thing was I also knew (the FBI) can’t do anything without being invited. So they agreed to that.
 “Now, it depends on how they word it. If they word it one way, (the FBI) will be just observers, but if they word it another way, the U.S. can actually have agents investigate. Right now, their hands are kind of tied because they can’t do anything unless any suspects come to the United States. Then, they can question them.”

BRISTOL -- A co-president of the Bristol Warren Education Association said in an email that a Bristol teacher recently testing positive for the coronavirus is an example of why the association has been advocating for the school district to continue with distance learning for the beginning of the year and gradually begin in-person learning as conditions become safer.
 Responding to a reporter's question about a teacher testing positive, association co-president Michelle Way DaSilva wrote that she could not discuss specifics of the case, but that it exemplifies concerns her group has had for months.
 "What we can say is that this is surely a sign of things to come," she wrote. "Once schools open up with any form of in-person teaching, we expect to see many more cases and more disruptions to our district schools because of it."
 Bristol Warren Regional School District Superintendent Jonathan Brice did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.
 DaSilva wrote that she believes the district administration has taken measures to protect the health and safety of students and staff. But, she said she thinks that members of the school community should not be expected to return until they have proof that it will be safe, even in buildings full of young students.
 "To accomplish this enormous task, our School Committee needs to acknowledge that our students are children, and will therefore behave as children do; generally, children are often unpredictable and are not always cognizant of the potential consequences of their actions," she wrote. "It is the job of every adult to do what we can to protect them, starting with the School Committee."
 In a back-to-school letter posted to the district's website at the end of August, Brice wrote that the school was preparing to reopen either in person, with distance learning, or in a hybrid mode and that the administration would be flexible and adapt to changing circumstances.
 Last week, Gov. Gina Raimondo said that all districts in the state have the "green light" to open for full in-person learning, except for Providence and Central Falls because of high positive test rates. However some districts, such as Cumberland, have opted to open the school year with distance learning, while others, such as Warwick, have chosen to bring some students back and others will learn remotely.

In the Miners first two games this year, it has been the Defense that has shined, while the Offense develops week-by-week. With players returning from injury or various quarantine issues, and changes in personnel placement that Offense did indeed come out swinging against Monrovia last Friday Night. One of those Miners playing for the 1st time this year was JR Colin Padgett at WB. It took one play to see what he brings to the Miner offense with a pitch going to his right, be made a cut and turned on the blasters to the tune of 69 yards for a score just seconds into the contest. However, a needless late penalty flag sailed across the Bulldog 37 that erased most of that amazing first carry. Another insert into the line-up for the 1st time was Sophomore Wrigley Franklin at Right Guard for his initial varsity experience other than special teams. The move designed to give the Miners more one-way players and depth as the season progresses. The O-Line consisting of Jr Donovan DeBruhl, Soph Aiden Giles, Sr Damien Giles, and Sr Landon Giles, along with Franklin, were a big part in the 403 total yards produced in the win. It was the best showing of the year thus far.

More excitement immediately came to the Linton faithful and Smith’s kickoff bee-lined off Wray’s front line helmet, and Smith himself was the first to jump on the ball at the Monrovia 49. Linton went for it all with a deep sideline aerial intended for Poe, but it was too long. Linton did not take advantage of the turnover, but Junior Jaydan Miller continued to punt well for Linton, pinning the Bulldogs at their own 1-yard line as Sophomore Jaxson Walker hustled to down the ball. The Miner Defense forced a three-and-out, and Sophomore Hunter Johns retuned the Belcher punt back to the Bulldog 29 for a terrific opportunity. However, the Miners would drop 8-yards back on an errant pitch caused by Bulldog DE Jalen Whalen, and that was luckily recovered by Linton’s SR Landon Giles to keep possession. All was well, though, as on 3rd and 10, Padgett exhibited more speed with a 19-yard burst to the Bulldog 10. Two plays later, it would Smith bowling over from 6-yards out. Goodman ran in for the 2-point conversion and a Linton 22-to-8 lead 1:49 into the 2nd stanza.

Dorothy Mae Lickey-Stansbury            Dorothy Mae Lickey-Stansbury, age 92, born Tuesday, February 10, 1928, in Wichita, Kansas went to join our Heavenly Father and her husband, on Wednesday, September 2, 2020. Dorothy was the daughter of Alfred Lorenzo Lickey and Grace May Witters-Lickey-Ross. She was preceded in death by her loving and devoted husband, Richard Dean Stansbury; her parents; her brother, Robert F. Lickey; and stepfather, Elwood Ross. Dorothy is survived by daughter, Cheryl D. Stansbury, and her two children, Barbara Clary and Robert W. Webster; son, Gary C and Priscilla N. Stansbury; and their three children, Joseph and Adriana Stansbury and Victoria Anaya; son, Roger D and Linda K. Stansbury and their daughter, Shelly K Green and husband John; five grand kids, 14 great grandkids and sister, Betty Jean Woten of Clayton, NM      She met her husband on a blind date, set up by his friend, through her sister. That was a Labor Day Dance. It was instant love. She married Richard D. Stansbury, just 3 months later, on Saturday, December 28, 1946 in Wichita, Kansas. In 2020 they were married for 73 years, still just as much in love. Dorothy graduated from Wichita High School North. Dorothy was a secretary in Garden City, KS for an insurance company. She took typing, comptometer, and shorthand lessons at the Junior College while she was there. Then it was on to Kalamazoo, Michigan where she went to school to be a nurse at Bronson Methodist Hospital. She graduated as a Licensed Practical Nurse and went to work at a county hospital for a doctor for a short time.      She and her husband were transferred to Aurora, Ill.

PARIS (Reuters) - Auchan a annoncé mercredi que son plan de transformation des hypermarchés allait se traduire par la suppression de 1.088 emplois nets.
 Le distributeur français a lancé l'an dernier un plan baptisé Auchan 2022 qui vise à transformer en profondeur son offre et qui devrait lui permettre de réaliser des économies de l'ordre de 1,1 milliard d'euros.
 "Après une première étape de mise en oeuvre annoncée en janvier 2020, dont les premiers résultats sont tangibles, Auchan Retail France passe à la deuxième phase de son plan de transformation", écrit le groupe dans un communiqué.
 "Ce projet aboutira à la suppression nette de 1.088 emplois actuellement occupés (1.475 postes seront supprimés, dont 10 vacants, et 377 postes créés)", détaille le groupe.

With the backline locked in, goalkeeper Landon Houk had a relatively uneventful night. In fact, he recorded his first assist of the year before his first save. He took an errant long pass into the box and punted the ball down the field. After a bounce, the ball found the head of Darnell who tapped it down to his feet and finished with a powerful strike into the right side of the net. The time it took to score from the moment the ball left the foot of Houk until Darnell scored was about seven seconds.
 That quick strike ability makes the Lakers a dangerous matchup, but with it being the first game of the year there were still areas of improvement.
 With about 10 minutes left to play, the Lakers had played a near-perfect game defensively, but one slip up gave Graves County the opportunity they needed. Just like that, the score was 2-1.
 “We had a 2-0 lead which is, a lot of the time, the most dangerous lead in soccer because the second that one goal gets put in from the other team its 2-1 and momentum can shift,” Pierce said. “We may have had a panic moment for about a minute, but I feel like we got things straightened out and I’m glad we were put in that situation tonight in the first game because going forward I think we will be more comfortable if that happens.”
 The Lakers held on for the win and will now prepare for their next game on Saturday at 2 p.m. when they travel to face St. Mary.
 As for the Lady Lakers, their night went a bit differently. In a matchup with the Lady Eagles, Calloway (0-1) came up short in a 4-1 loss under new head coach Savana Thielen.
 Despite the final score, the game never felt out of hand. The Lady Lakers allowed an early goal within the first 10 minutes, but settled into a rhythm and had some good attacks in the first half. By halftime, they had already taken nine corner kicks and had nine shots, but trailed 1-0.

Junior outside-hitter Adison Hicks lead the Lakers’ defense with 11 digs and eight kills on offense and was generally all over the place being a major thorn in the Lady Wildcats’ side. Senior setter Maggie Fraher led the night with eight aces.
 Third-year head coach Lindsey Jones and assistant coach Melissa Hicks commented on only losing one senior from last year and have basically the same team returning, however they did move some assets up from the junior varsity squad for the season that did contribute last night and will be key factors over the course of the season if they keep up the solid play. They expect bigger things for this year. Coach Jones was proud of the effort on Tuesday and praised the play of sophomore right-side hitter Lillie Thorne, Friedrich and praised Hicks on her hustle and kills on the night.
 The 2020 season looks bright if the effort can be consistent over the course of the whole match, and, with no more lulls or slip-ups, they have the ability to do some great things.

Ever since Chrissy Teigen and her husband John Legend revealed they're expecting their third child (via his _Wild_ video), we've been loving her social media updates about how the pregnancy is progressing. Both John and Chrissy have openly discussed seeking fertility treatment in the past - something that no doubt resonated with many other couples - to help conceive daughter Luna, 4, and son Miles, 2, whereas their third bundle of joy was a welcome surprise.
 Understandably, like many expectant mothers, Chrissy shared with her fans that she's experienced a bit of anxiety along the way. Writing to her 31 million followers, she shared a sweet video of little Luna helping with her ultrasound scan.
 "On weekends, we freak out! Before I'm able to start feeling the kicks, the anxiety gets the best of me and any little bits of spotting or pain freak me ouuuuuut," said Chrissy. "One day I swear I'll buy one of these machines, but by then I'll be all done with having monsters! But as my little Luna embarks on her very first sleepover tonight, another little one makes some big growth moves of their own. All is well."  
 It's worth noting that while it may feel scary, light bleeding during pregnancy generally shouldn't be cause for concern (although you should always get it checked out by a doctor if it's causing you to worry).

I was saddened to learn that as simple an act as flying the pride flag was not already done as a matter of course in East Devon. Society has changed from top to bottom, but especially in rural communities, showing solidarity with groups that fall outside of the accepted ‘norms’ is incredibly important, giving hope to people that they are not alone, isolated or without support.
 I grew up gay in such an environment. A small rural Fenland market town where a homosexual was considered as exotic and as rare a beast as a Scottish Tory. But I was lucky enough that my family and friends showed understanding and compassion. My sexuality mattered not one jot, and for that I remain eternally grateful. Not everyone is this lucky. Isolation, ridicule, violent abuse - all still shockingly common. So the motion proposed by Cllr Jeffery and myself was not virtue signalling, not political correctness gone mad but a serious statement of intent - we will not accept homophobic, or any other form of abuse here, and we stand with those struggling to come to terms with their sexuality in the face of this.
 Now it is official. East Devon will fly the flag and celebrate both Pride Month and Bisexual Awareness Week. Unbelievably, some supposedly upstanding members chose to either vote against or abstain from the two motions that were passed, proving that old fashioned attitudes to sexuality prevail. We live in the 21st century and I am delighted that the attitudes of the majority of members are progressive enough to see that no matter who you love, you’re welcome here.
 Be nice to one another, folks

He had to tell me that my beloved Uncle Remus was not coming back — ever.
 Randall Kenan was jovial, kind, and wise, not unlike the Uncle Remus he was taking away from me.
 Kenan died last week at a much too early 57. Like Uncle Remus, he was an expert on trickster stories, mainly based on legends from Africa and about animals and mischievous creatures who were cunning and smart and had an ability to somehow get around the powerful and the oppressive by tricking them.
 That, I said, is just like Br’er Fox who tricked Br’er Rabbit into hitting and getting stuck in a tar baby figure. Then the rabbit told the fox he could do anything with him, but “Please don’t throw me in the briar patch.” So, of course, the fox threw the rabbit in the briar patch, where the rabbit called out happily, “I was born and bred in the briar patch.”

I was saddened to learn that as simple an act as flying the pride flag was not already done as a matter of course in East Devon. Society has changed from top to bottom, but especially in rural communities, showing solidarity with groups that fall outside of the accepted 'norms' is incredibly important, giving hope to people that they are not alone, isolated or without support. I grew up gay in such an environment. A small rural Fenland market town where a homosexual was considered as exotic and as rare a beast as a Scottish Tory. But I was lucky enough that my family and friends showed understanding and compassion. My sexuality mattered not one jot, and for that I remain eternally grateful. Not everyone is this lucky. Isolation, ridicule, violent abuse - all still shockingly common. So the motion proposed by Cllr Jeffery and myself was not virtue signalling, not political correctness gone mad but a serious statement of intent - we will not accept homophobic, or any other form of abuse here, and we stand with those struggling to come to terms with their sexuality in the face of this. Now it is official. East Devon will fly the flag and celebrate both Pride Month and Bisexual Awareness Week. Unbelievably, some supposedly upstanding members chose to either vote against or abstain from the two motions that were passed, proving that old fashioned attitudes to sexuality prevail. We live in the 21st century and I am delighted that the attitudes of the majority of members are progressive enough to see that no matter who you love, you're welcome here. Be nice to one another, folks

Charles Page Hicks, 79, of Maple City, passed away peacefully on August 29, 2020, at The Maples in Frankfort. He was born on October 26, 1940, to the late William and Ethel (Daugherty) Hicks Sr. in Glen Dale, West Virginia.
 Charles is survived by his wife, Kathleen Morse-Hicks; and his children, Brady (Debbie) Hicks, of Columbus, Ohio; Jodi (Steve) Kersh, of Kent, Ohio; along with three grandsons: Jacob (Molly) Kersh, Dane Kersh, Grant Kersh; and great- grandson, Garrett. He is also survived by his sister, Sue (Richard) Anderson, of Beulah; and was preceded in death by his brother, William Hicks, of Findlay, Ohio.
 Charles was an All-Star football player in high school and attended the University of Florida, where he was rewarded with a football scholarship. He is a Veteran of the Vietnam War, where he served as a Police Officer in the U.S. Army, from 1964 to 1967. Charles then attended Findlay College in Findlay, Ohio, and received an engineering degree. He worked for Cooper Tire as an Industrial Engineer, and retired in January 1996 from the Bowling Green, Ohio, plant.
 Charles moved to Maple City, where he enjoyed his retirement and his favorite hobby of fly fishing the rivers of northern Michigan. He also filled his time with jobs doing security at The Homestead and Crystal Mountain. This allowed him the opportunity to meet wonderful people, as he enjoyed the many conversations with property owners and vacationers.
 There will be a private remembrance at a later date, and cremation services will be fulfilled by Bennett-Barz Funeral Home. This soft spoken, West Virginia gentleman's only request to those who knew and loved him was to simply think of him once in a while and smile.
 The Bennett-Barz Funeral Home, in Beulah, is in charge of arrangements.

For months, Americans have been told not to worry about the costs of coronavirus tests, which are crucial to stopping the pandemic’s spread. “It is critical that Americans have peace of mind knowing that cost won’t be a barrier to testing during this national public health emergency,” Medicare’s administrator, Seema Verma, said in April.
 Congress passed laws requiring insurers to pay for tests, and the Trump administration created a program to cover the bills of the uninsured. Cities and states set up no-cost testing sites.
 Patients, whether with or without insurance, are beginning to find holes in those new coverage programs. Nationwide, people have been hit with unexpected fees and denied claims related to coronavirus tests, according to dozens of bills that The New York Times has reviewed. Insurers have told these patients they could owe from a few dollars to thousands.
 These patients responded to a Times request for medical bills related to coronavirus testing and treatment, allowing us to identify previously unreported patterns in medical billing.
 They are not alone. About 2.4% of coronavirus tests billed to insurers leave the patient responsible for some portion of payment, according to the health data firm Castlight. With 77 million tests performed so far, it could add up to hundreds of thousands of Americans who receive unexpected bills.
 “Whether it’s through legislative action or public statements, Congress has made it really clear that there shouldn’t be cost sharing for COVID-19 testing,” said Julie Khani, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association. “In practice, that’s not really the case.”

Linton indeed had momentum on their side coming out in the second half, but Monrovia would change that in 2 plays. On 2nd and 13, Clements fired deep to his right down the Bulldog sideline to a streaking Payne. The Miner defender seemed to have a play on the ball, but mistimed his attempt to knock the ball away. Instead, it was a perfect strike into #36’s breadbasket, and he battled Poe off and ran the final 35-yards in a 69-yard play. Linton would hold on the 2-point play, leaving the scoreboard to read Linton 30 and Monrovia 20, and a brand-new ball game. The question on all Monrovia fans minds was "Could the Bulldogs stop the Miner offense?" An 8 play 63-yard drive would answer that question with a 20-yard Gennicks run, and yet another Smith gutbuster of 25, Linton rolled to the Bulldog 5 with Gennicks scoring on a 3rd and goal at the 7:16 mark of the Third Quarter. Again, a pass attempt to Poe would not connect, but Linton led 36-20 at this point.

Altro elemento rilevante è se il nostro mutuo sia stato contratto a tasso fisso o variabile. Alcuni anni fa, quando i tassi di interesse erano più alti, si diceva che la surroga fosse più conveniente per coloro che avessero un mutuo a tasso fisso. In effetti un cliente con un tasso fisso ormai non più adeguato ai tempi è più interessato alla surroga per poter sfruttare i tassi più bassi offerti da altri istituti. Invece chi in origine avesse scelto un tasso variabile, oggi usufruisce già dell’abbassamento naturale degli interessi e quindi è meno stimolato a cercare condizioni più favorevoli.

“Twelve of these girls allegedly survived sexual violence and/or a forced and early marriage directly linked to their recruitment,” the report said.
 For a second year in a row, the three U.N.-backed experts were denied access to Yemen by the Saudi-led coalition, which is allied with the internationally recognized Yemeni government. The rejection came despite repeated requests, said the report, which is to be considered by the 47-member-state rights council that starts its autumn session next Monday.
 Overall, the experts insisted, there are “no clean hands” in the conflict, which has involved rights abuses and violations, including arbitrary killings and detention, rape and sexual violence, torture and other “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” — all possibly involving war crimes.
 The experts also faulted the Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, saying the coalition has failed to do enough to avoid civilian casualties at times.
 “Yemen remains a tortured land, with its people ravaged in ways that should shock the conscience of humanity,” said Kamel Jendoubi, who chairs the expert panel. “The international community has a responsibility to put an end to this pandemic of impunity, and should not turn a blind eye to the gross violations that have been committed in Yemen.”

In late July he tweeted about a new massacre in eastern Congo, saying that as long as the U.N. mapping report is “ignored” such killings will continue.
 Rwanda’s government in the past has objected to suggestions that its forces had any involvement in the unrest in eastern Congo shortly before and after the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 in which some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.
 Rwandan President Paul Kagame in a nationally televised interview on Sunday said of the U.N. mapping report, “I don't know what that nonsense is about.” He asserted that “people are starting the narrative at the time of their choosing.” He didn't mention Mukwege in the interview.
 Rwanda’s state-run newspaper, The New Times, on Sunday published an unsigned commentary criticizing Mukwege and the U.N. report and dismissing suggestions that Rwanda or Kabarebe was behind the death threats as “unfounded allegations.”
 The commentary alleged a “defamation campaign” against Kabarebe and suggested that Mukwege and his allies had “staged” the threats themselves, asserting that they see the instability in eastern Congo as “the essential milk cow on which to build careers and get rich.”
 In a statement to the AP, the director of policy for Physicians for Human Rights, Susannah Sirkin, said the organization is “dismayed by the inadequate, slow, and bureaucratic response to date by the United Nations in light of the serious threats against our esteemed colleague … The U.N. needs to step up now by restoring the presence of a permanent and around-the-clock (peacekeeping) unit on-site at Panzi Hospital.”
