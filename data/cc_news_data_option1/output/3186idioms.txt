Miami has an off day before facing Atlanta for three games to start a seven- game homestand. The Marlins’ grueling road odyssey began with a trip to Atlanta on July 21 for a pair of exhibition games and moved on to Philadelphia for a season-opening, three-game series.
 The Marlins, however, had their return home delayed when an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred, forcing seven games to be postponed.
 Despite the travel woes, the Marlins have had at least a share of first place in the NL East every day so far this season.
 Sierra’s two-run single put Miami ahead 13-11. Jesus Aguilar drove in four runs with three hits, including an RBI single in the 10th.
 Travis Shaw hit two homers for the Blue Jays, including the 100th of his career. Teoscar Hernandez, Rowdy Tellez and Danny Jansen each hit two-run homers while Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bichette added solo shots. The last time a team lost while hitting at least seven homers came when the Chicago White Sox hit seven and fell to Toronto on June 25, 2016.
 Toronto last hit at least seven homers when they struck for eight in a 17-11 win against Tampa Bay on Aug 7, 2010.
 Brian Anderson hit a three-run homer in the Miami first.
 The two games in Buffalo may have indicated that there’s a jetstream in the ballpark which, along with the win, could be enough to give the Marlins’ plane home a good push forward after squandering an early 8-0 lead.

"
 When the calendar flipped from December 2019 to January 2020, I knew it meant so much more than a new month, a new year and a new decade. As a community engagement coordinator for a nonprofit in a heavily immigrant community, 2020 was going to be an important and transitional year.
 At the time, however, I also had no idea what a crazy and challenging year it would become. Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, our plans and our approach had to change overnight.
 My employer, the Asian Community Development Corporation (ACDC), works with newly arrived immigrants in various communities in and around Boston. We have a significant presence in Malden, where we help people from dozens of countries acclimate to life in the U.S., assisting with questions about housing, education and financial institutions.
 In planning for 2020, we expected to do all of that, but in addition, we would have to educate people about the census and the upcoming elections. That would mean explaining the reasoning and importance of filling out the census forms. Further, we help inform citizens about voting -- when the elections are, the various offices on the ballot and how to register.
 Traditionally, that approach is in-person contact. There is tremendous value in sitting with the people you're serving, explaining point-by-point the procedures involved and answering any and all questions.
 But in the age of coronavirus, that simply isn't possible. Face-to-face meetings are dangerous propositions, particularly for elderly persons -- and we work with many. To further complicate things, many new immigrants -- especially the elderly -- are not technologically savvy. That makes contact like Zoom calls -- which many of us quickly adapted to without too much trouble -- difficult.
 The pandemic forced us to scramble quickly. Working with Greater Malden Asian American Community Coalition (GMAACC), with whom we partner on many undertakings, we quickly scrambled and came with us alternative strategies. Senior center seminars and monthly community meetings were quickly replaced. Instead, we coordinated with Mass. Voter Table to set up phone banks and acquire lists of phone numbers.
 This aim at reaching people in an old-fashioned way has paid dividends. Our goal at the outset of the year, before the pandemic, was to reach 3,000 people in Malden. Through mid-July, we have reached nearly 2,500 residents -- and almost 2,000 of them by phone. We are far ahead of our projections that were initially designed, in large part, to be seminars and in-person meetings.
 These points of contact are not simply quick check-ins in which a scripted message is read and quickly forgotten. ACDC and GMAACC workers patiently provide a background, a rationale and then step-by-step instructions.
 For the census, for example, it is imperative that people understand not that they need to fill out the form, but why. We explain that this data determines how Congressional districts are drawn and that impacts not only who provides their voice in Washington, D.C., but determines how much money comes back to their local communities. This, in turn, influences the operations of their schools, fire and police departments and access to much needed governmental services.
 We also act as counselors and healers. Many immigrants worry about listing their names and addresses with a governmental entity that may have been intimidating or threatening to both documented and undocumented people. We stress that the census is not a tool to identify those the government may be looking for. It's a means to get the most accurate count possible so people can get the representation they're entitled to.
 Voting can be even more confusing. Immigrant or not, most registered voters have never participated in vote by mail, which is what is being encouraged in Massachusetts this year as a means to keep people from gathering at the polls on election day (there are actually two elections coming up -- a primary on Sept. 1 and the presidential election on Nov. 3). Traditionally, if a citizen is already registered to vote, he or she simply would show up at the polling location on election day and vote.
 Voting by mail is different. The Secretary of the Commonwealth last month mailed an application to every registered voter in Massachusetts for a ballot. The voter needs to answer a few questions, sign, put on a return address and mail it back before Aug. 26 in order to be mailed the ballot. A few days later the ballot will be mailed and the voter will have to fill that out and mail it back before the election, as well.
 These multiple touch points will confuse and confound even seasoned voters. For immigrants trying hard to understand the cultures, customs and norms of a new place, it's even harder. I know how hard it is. I arrived in Boston from China in 2013 to attend Northeastern University. I've experienced how hard it is to assimilate and acclimate. And I did it without also having to deal with a global pandemic.
 But my experience is what drives me and my colleagues at ACDC (and GMAACC) to work hard and help out. The pandemic isn't slowing us down. The work is too important.

So, why the controversy? First, the Trump campaign is one of the advertisers in question. To many on the hard left, running ads for that campaign is akin to working with the devil. They want us to tip the scales and refuse to take ads from the Trump campaign. There are two candidates for president. We are happy to run ads for either one; we have offered to do so for each and think it's eminently reasonable for each to do so, considering our audience is politically engaged and covers a broad cross section of political America, from liberals to conservatives. Ironically, if we refused to sell ads to one side, we would be tipping the scales in a partisan direction.

Second, the Coast Guard does (and should continue to) play an integral role in reinforcing good order at sea and compliance with international norms. It is uniquely situated to do so regarding key issues in day-to-day-day competition such as maintaining rule of law, including through fisheries enforcement and promoting U.S. sovereignty in the Arctic. The Coast Guard will also continue to serve as an agent of U.S. law enforcement, and thus cannot always act strictly with an eye toward maintenance of the international order in a time of strategic competition. Yet the Coast Guard must make hard choices where those obligations conflict (i.e., system maintenance versus other constabulary duties), and policymakers must evaluate whether certain tasks optimally utilize a limited national resource to maximal effect in defense of core security and economic norms. Counter-drug missions in the Caribbean offer one such example. They consume high levels of Coast Guard resources, are doubtless important to its law enforcement functions, but represent a Sisyphean effort that may not optimally use finite assets in defense of the most important norms in the international order. That is the type of policy prioritization balance facing the Coast Guard in day-to-day competition.

McKenzie said concerns about blocking the spread of the virus among European allies and other nations in the region has complicated efforts to repatriate camp residents to their home nations.
 Repatriation is the key to clearing out the refugee camps, and the U.S. has aggressively pushed to get allies to take their own citizens back. Most nations, however, are reluctant to take in potential IS insurgents.
 Humanitarian groups say many of the women and children are not risks, but officials also note that there are a lot of women who were radicalized and active in the insurgency.
 McKenzie said that unless political leaders find a way to deradicalize and repatriate the displaced people in the camps, there will be another IS resurgence in the future.
 “As young people grow up, we’re going to see them again unless we can turn them in a way to make them productive members of society,” he said.
 “We can either deal with this problem now or deal with it exponentially worse a few years down the road.”

The words, “I have the right to/not to (fill in the blank),” are being heard around the United States a lot these days. It’s true. We Americans have a multitude of rights as compared to billions around the world.
 Having been out of school for quite some time (and not being a history buff), I decided to review some basic rights that we do have here, especially those that were unique to a democratic nation just feeling its way to a new path to being in a land far from its original roots.
 One vital “gift” we citizens (age 18 and above) possess is that we each are granted the privilege of the right to vote. The trouble with rights is that sometimes we aren’t sure we really want them; maybe we don’t feel we know enough to make informed decisions or perhaps it’s just easier to let others carry that load. I’ve felt ill-prepared, left some lines or boxes blank and have missed some local elections, and, well, failed to do my part.
 Finally, I now recognize that my right to vote is a hard-fought privilege, which many individuals shed tears and blood to attain. Just recently, our country has been saying “goodbye” to a courageous man, Representative John Lewis, whose life has been one of placing himself on a dangerous road to ensuring the right to vote for all Americans. Representative Lewis wanted so much to be part of the American experience that he was willing to die for the right to vote and participate as a member of the American citizenry.

Stute won 2,000 races in a career that began in the late 1940s and ended when he retired in 2011. He had career purse earnings of $55,653,244, according to Equibase, a racing database.
 His peak came in the mid-'80s when California-bred Snow Chief won the 1986 Santa Anita Derby and Florida Derby. The colt finished 11th in the Kentucky Derby, but two weeks later won the Preakness under Alex Solis by four lengths over Derby winner Ferdinand, who was ridden by Hall of Famer Bill Shoemaker.
 Stute's run of success continued with fillies Brave Raj and Very Subtle. Brave Raj won the 1986 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Santa Anita and earned an Eclipse Award as the nation's best 2-year-old filly. Very Subtle beat male horses to win the 1987 BC Sprint at Hollywood Park.
 Another of Stute's top horses was Telly's Pop. After breeding him, Stute sold him for $6,000 as a yearling to movie mogul Howard W. Koch and actor Telly Savalas, who named him for his father. Telly's Pop won four stakes as a 2-year-old in 1975. He was regarded as a Kentucky Derby hopeful, but finished fifth as the favorite in the 1976 Santa Anita Derby and didn't win again before being retired the following year.
 Stute's training expertise was shown best with inexpensive horses. He typically sought out horses that cost $25,000 to $30,000 and then tried to break even on them. Very Subtle cost $30,000 and she retired with career earnings of $1,608,360.
 Gary Stute recalled that the most his father ever spent on a horse was $300,000 for Brave Raj, and that was the exception.

The company Hadco from Conroe, Texas, is doing an appraisal on the current valuation and also did the one on the previous protest.
 Commissioners currently expect to shave a half-million dollars from the budget. Burns said it will take a $553,000 reduction to get the mil levy to the same as last year’s.

 The county is waiting to see if coronavirus relief funding will be approved, but commissioners said they may not hear from the state until after the budget deadline.
 County Attorney Linus Thuston said the courts may see some savings
 during 2020 because of the difficulty in scheduling cases during the coronavirus pandemic, but they could have face greater expenses during 2021.
 Commissioners discussed funding for outside agencies, the health department, capital improvement, law enforcement and other departments Tuesday, but will have to wait for more information from the Road and Bridge Department.
 The Martin and Osa Johnson Safari Museum requested $20,000 in county funding. The county has not funded the museum in the past and Commissioners Klaassen and Paul Westhoff were uncertain about adding it while department heads are asked to toe the line.
 Orr suggested funding $10,000 to fund the Safari Museum equally with the St. Paul Mission Museum.

The Dodgers, winners of seven straight National League West titles and nine consecutive season series against the Padres, seemed to have noticed a shift in the dynamic of the bully relationship.
 “I think they feel confident and don’t necessarily feel they are a lesser team than us,” Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling said after taking the loss in Tuesday’s game. “I think they feel like they compete with us, and they’ve showed it. We’ve played them five times and it seems like every game has been a good one. They are a confident young team, really good lineup, good bullpen, starters are good. They feel like they can compete with anyone and that’s the energy they bring.”
 The thing about baseball, with its relentless schedule, is that there is no such thing as being able to rise to the occasion every day.
 And so it was that the Padres went down meekly Wednesday, arguably more so than in any game this season and definitely for no more than the second or third time in 19 games.

I recently stepped away from a career in community newspapers where I spent the better part of my days consuming vast quantities of news stories and commentary, both in print and online.
   
 After a full day of being bombarded by headlines and suffering from information overload, the last thing I wanted to do was watch another news broadcast on television.
   
 But after being away from the news industry for a time, I began tuning in to daytime cable news shows. Whether CNN, Fox, or MSNBC, I witnessed all of these cable network "news" broadcasts routinely do something that violates the very principles of fair and impartial reporting. Almost without fail, the anchors/hosts of these news shows on each network routinely mingled their own personal opinion with the day's headlines.
   
 This does not even include the "talking head" analysis shows in which a panel of political insiders hold forth their learned opinions on the the news of the day. But now, even moderators insert their personal judgment and opinions.
   
 There was a time when this was strictly forbidden. Legendary CBS anchorman, the late Walter Cronkite, was known as "the most trusted man in America" for a reason. He reported the news impartially and revealed no personal bias while doing so. Whether it was the Kennedy assassinations, the rise of the NASA space program, the heat of the Civil Rights movement, or the Watergate scandal, he reported accurately and faithfully each evening to the American viewing public.
   
 In the rare occasions when Cronkite did engage in commentary -- as he famously did during the Vietnam War -- the editorial content was clearly segregated from the rest of the newscast (usually at the end) and it was typically labeled "Commentary."
   
 Early network TV shows featuring news analysis and commentary were strictly segregated from nightly newscasts. It applied to all three networks (ABC, NBC, CBS) and a virtual pantheon of broadcast news giants like Chet Huntley, David Brinkley, Frank Reynolds, and Edward R. Murrow, followed this template.
   
 Sadly, this is no longer a common practice. Networks on both the right and left of the political spectrum (a problem in itself) routinely cloud news reporting with personal "takes," comments, and outright editorializing. This practice has helped undermine, if not completely destroy, the credibility of the national TV news media.
   
 Everyone has become an instant expert or political operative more interested in scoring points for "their side." This troublesome practice has only become more acute and widespread during the Trump presidency and the resulting political polarization.
   
 Who can we trust? Is there still a TV network out there somewhere that plays it straight?
   
 There are scant options. Ironically, during this time of near-constant information flow, accurate and unbiased information is even more difficult to identify. Facebook and Twitter are certainly not the answer.
   
 This is why your local news outlets are still a vital, if not indispensable, source of reliable news and information. Unlike the national media, community newspapers, local radio stations and TV stations are typically focused on the community. The hard-working journalists who staff local media outlets live and work among the very people and organizations they frequently report on. And unlike much of the national electronic media, this holds local journalists accountable and responsive to their audience.
   
 In some ways, the national "media" (the one most Americans complain about most often) and the local news outlets are almost different industries. Never has that become more clear than it is today.
   
 For information that actually impacts your daily life, subscribe to a local newspaper, or listen to a newscast on a local radio station. They still label news as news and opinion as opinion. You'll also be more informed than almost anyone else relying solely on national or social media.
   
 In the immortal words of Cronkite, "And that's the way it is …"

During their playing days, current softball coaches Jill Callaway, Erin King and Lauren Robison played at a very high level in high school and college. Now their youthful protege players on the American Softball Association 12U Region 2 Red team are headed to Oklahoma seeking a national championship.
 Callaway, who played her high school days at Grace Brethren School in Clinton and then later the University of Maryland, oversees the 5-Star Athletics Softball program that has developed younger players for over 20 years. This will be the third straight year that Callaway has taken a team to Oklahoma, with her squads having finished third and fifth, respectively, in the previous two tournaments.
 “Our region includes players from Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and North Carolina and we probably had over 125 girls tryout for spots,” Callaway said. “The competition for spots was very, very tough. I thought we had a great system of grading all of the players for various pitching, hitting, fielding and base running skills.”
 Robison, a Calvert High School graduate who will be heading into her fifth year — fourth season — as the Cavaliers softball coach in 2021, is also eager to see how the local squad will perform in Oklahoma. Robison was among the first group of players to come through the 5-Star Athletics program 20 years ago and now she is among the full-time coaches.
 “When I started going to Jill’s camps she said I was going to be her first full-time employee and of course, I didn’t believe her,” Robison said. “But she brought me on board and this has been a great experience. The girls we had at tryouts were really, really good. It was very tough to get down to 15, but I think this is the best group that we’ve ever had going to Oklahoma.”
 King, a Bowie High School graduate who later played for Dickinson College, has been among the 5-Star coaches for 12 years and also took part in several of the tryouts. King, however, will be unable to make the trip to Oklahoma this summer since she recently gave birth to her second child. But King is confident this group will perform well in Nationals even in her absence.
 “The last tryout that I was able to attend in Delaware in February had a lot of really talented girls,” said King, a former Prince George’s County player of the year who now lives in Church Hill, Maryland. “Not only do these girls have talent, but this is definitely the biggest team that we have put together. We looked at what the other teams had that won out there and we tried to mirror this team to give us the best chance of winning.”
 Heading to Oklahoma as part of the Region 2 Red team are Maryland residents Taylor Castle, Abbie Frsivold and Mackenzie Knight, Delaware resident Baylee Lynch, Virginia residents Meadow Coleman, Tegan Gabrielle, Marlee Gaskell, Tess Gray, Mazie Harmon, Deryn Johnson, Kaylee Lizardo and Rayne Wright and North Carolinians Morgan Donovant, Tamia Gwynn and Emma Salter.
 Each of the teams in the National Tournament in Oklahoma are guaranteed four games, including at least one game in the main stadium. Each team will play three games at fields near the main complex and tournament bracket play will begin on Sunday.

Patients with penetrating trauma to the head, neck, or torso and without evidence of spinal cord injury on initial EMS examination do not need to be immobilized on a backboard. Patients who are ambulatory but require spinal precautions can have a cervical collar applied and be secured appropriately to the EMS stretcher.32

Protests continued nationwide calling for the fall of the regime. During a press conference on October 18, Hariri blamed his government partners for blocking sweeping reforms and announced a 72-hour deadline for the government to prepare a long overdue economic reform plan. While Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah sympathized with the protesters, he echoed his ally—FPM leader and Foreign Minister Jibran Bassil—in warning that the government’s resignation would create a power vacuum. Meanwhile, the Lebanese Forces (LF) announced the resignation of its four ministers, marking the first tangible success of the protesters’ demands. Hezbollah feared that radical changes in Lebanon, including reform, would be used to undermine its role in the country and region. Hezbollah ‘has long been a target of US-led attempts to isolate it, a drive that the Trump administration intensified in 2019 in tandem with its “maximum pressure” campaign against the party’s main external sponsor, Iran.’ It should be noted that Hezbollah is designated by the US as a terrorist organization.

Quoc Tran drifted with me on the race course, and we actually arrived about a half hour early and inspected the course area. The wind at that time was filling in on the right-hand side of the course, and the left side near Turkey Neck point seemed to have areas of glass on the lake.
 The starting line seemed to be in the worst area of the lake, where the wind seemed to vanish at times. The first race started, and all my pre-race investigating did nothing to aid my quest to win the race as the wind filled in the right hand side. We finally were within three boat lengths of the windward mark despite the lack of wind and constantly changing direction.
 As we approached, I saw one of the many powerboats set a course right to our windward mark. My competitor, Stephani Mahan calmly asked the boat to steer clear explaining we were under sail. The driver seeing the three boats wondered, “Wow are you all racing?” Grr... I answered with my hands. Hopefully the powerboat understood, because I did not want the powerboat anywhere near us.
 As we headed to the leeward mark, the wind stalled at times and the race committee shortened the course to one time around. Unfortunately, this meant most likely that wherever you rounded the leeward mark would likely be your place for the finish line since the leeward mark was so close to the finish line.
 The wind absolutely died at times as we proceeded down to the leeward mark, causing the spinnaker to just hang in the air with wrinkles. The wind filled into the course, and lo and behold, the silver fleet caught up to the gold fleet and we had to duke it out at the leeward mark for position.
 At least nine boats attempted to round the mark at the same time causing multiple pinwheel effects and stalled sailboats and many grumpy sailors. As one of the racers said, “What happens on the water should stay on the water!” I wish that were true. We finished the race DFL despite all our efforts.
 The next race started, and I unfortunately hit my competitor’s Tom Wolffe/Sue Henry boat while they were stalled on starboard tack. Trying to do a 720 in light wind is next to impossible when your crew wants to quit the race and stop sailing.
 Luckily, when we got to the leeward mark, the Silver Fleet was nowhere near us and we could attempt to catch at least one boat. As we headed to the starting line on starboard tack, I just hoped a magical lift would come our way. Well, that did not happen, and I needed to make my best guess when to tack onto port in order to cross the finish line.
 We had Connor/Hannah Lothrop’s boat pinned because they could not tack and cross us on port tack. As I tacked onto port, I hoped Quoc would know we were tacking because I did not want to give any advance notice to my competition. I just hoped we could drift over the line before them.
 As usual for this day, my wishes did not come true, and again we finished DFL on this miserable light wind Sunday. On the bright side, Melanie/Bill Dunham had two great races with two first-place finishes. Awesome job, Melanie and Bill!
 Melanie was able to relay some of the secrets to her success. She told me that she did a lot of footing around the course. Obviously, I had no idea what she meant. What is footing? You let your sails out so you are almost reaching around the course, becasue the goal in light air is to keep your boat moving.

Today I am going to start with a story. One of my dogs had been acting a little off lately, so I brought him to work to look at. (I will come back to this story in an article soon for different reasons.) This dog can’t stay at home alone, so he often comes to work with me. He hung out happily in my office until I got a moment to draw his blood. At this point, I called him out of the office. This is a common occurrence as I have him clean up treat bits, get on the scale, etc. But this time he didn’t come. I called with enthusiasm, he didn’t come. I called sternly in my best “I’ counting to three” voice and he finally came slinking out. Ears back, tail between his legs.
 Why was he so reluctant to come? Why did he finally come out acting like I was about to inflict the end of days on him? He knew I was going to draw his blood and he doesn’t like it. He knew because he is a dog, and he doesn’t like it because he actually hates having anything done to him. Thankfully, most animals do not react like this.
 I’m actually going to tell another story now. My dogs like to be where I am, especially the aforementioned dog who can’t even be home without me. However, when I pick up the nail clippers both dogs and my cat hit the road and hide in other rooms until I force them out.

“She was a nice lady but at the same she was costing us because people would try to avoid her. They would leave and go across the street,” said Nick Yorgakaros, who owns a pizzeria on the street where Holloway would often perform.
 Soon after her arrests, she got the help she needed, said Rosemarie Paine, a lawyer and friend who represented her for free. Holloway got into a facility offering treatment for substance abuse and got medication for her mental illness. She later moved into a nursing home.
 “She was able to come to terms with who she was and overcome a lot of her struggles with mental illness,” Paine said.
 As word spread about Holloway's death, friends said they were amazed that she managed to make art amid her chaotic life. A New York playwright who worked with Holloway is hoping to stage a play about her. There is also talk of a movie.
 “It is entirely fitting with the tragic trajectory of Margaret’s life that artistic recognition and interest come too late to do her any good,” Dailey said. “But still, I’m sure she would be pleased."

Welcome back. When he was born on Nov. 4, 1879, in the Cooweescoowee district of the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory, just outside of the present day town of Oologah, and given the name William Penn Adair Rogers, little did the parents of this baby boy know how famous their newborn son would become.
   
 Four years later on Jan. 19, 1883, on a lonely Iowa farm a mile east of the town of Conway, a pair of twin boys were born and given the names Wiate and Waite Phillips. Wiate was the oldest, having been delivered just a few minutes before Waite. Sadly, on July 16, 1902, Wiate died of acute appendicitis when he was just 19 years old. Like William Penn Adair Rogers, the remaining brother, Waite, went on to achieve greatness like few others have.
   
 These two men would meet often during their lifetimes, sometimes in Bartlesville, sometimes in Cimarron, New Mexico, establishing a friendship that lasted until their deaths. Rogers was killed in a plane crash in Barrows, Alaska, on Aug. 15, 1935, and Phillips died from a heart attack on Jan. 27, 1964, at his home in Bel Air, California. Both men did a lot for the state of Oklahoma and both were frequent visitors to Woolaroc, Waite's brother Frank Phillips' ranch.
   
 I often refer to epigrams written by Phillips and Rogers, and with the 85th anniversary of Rogers' death coming up this weekend here are a few that they wrote and lived by. I hope you will find them as inspirational as I do.
   
 "The only things we keep permanently are those we give away." -- Waite Phillips
   
 "The man who never makes mistakes never makes much of anything." -- WP
   
 "The most effective sermon is expressed in deeds instead of words." -- WP
   
 "Greediness, in all its various forms, is one of man's worst enemies and also the source of many others." -- WP
   
 "Wishful thinking consists of dreaming without doing. It's a useless habit." -- WP
   
 "A college education is beneficial if the student continues to learn after he graduates." -- WP
   
 "A man can fail many times but he isn't a failure until he begins to blame someone else." -- WP
   
 "It takes a strong character not to be demoralized by either sudden success or failure."
   
 "The trouble with many of us is we would rather be ruined by flattery and praise than saved by honest criticism." -- WP
   
 "Real philanthropy consists of helping others, outside our own family circle, from whom no thanks is expected or required" -- WP
   
 "To hate is to hurt -- not the hated but the hater. Fortunately, I have learned by experience to reduce the hate factor to that of simple disapproval." -- WP
   
 "We all make mistakes which, if admitted, adds to our judgment and strengths our character. To deny or try to defend them produces the exact opposite results." -- WP
   
 "No one should boast of being honest, dependable, courteous and considerate because these are fundamental qualities essential to good character that everyone ought to develop and use." -- WP
   
 "Even if you're on the right track you'll get run over if you just sit there." -- Will Rogers
   
 Look for a few more of Waite's and Will's epigrams next week. Till then I'll see ya down the road….

There is little evidence that great power competition will disrupt policymakers’ use of the sea services in pursuit of order maintenance. Such are core functions for the Coast Guard. And for the Navy and Marine Corps, the forces historically balanced small-scale missions with preparations for conflict. That these operations did not produce a substantial effect on strategy is what should concern us today. Despite being a dominant part of naval history, maritime security is often pursued as an annex to strategy, not logically derived from it. Policymakers can help avoid that mistake in this era, which begins by understanding good order at sea as central to, not an appendage of, great power competition.

IOWA CITY, Iowa — Hundreds of thousands of households in Iowa and Illinois remained without electricity Wednesday, two days after a rare wind storm that hit the Midwest devastated parts of the power grid, flattened valuable corn fields and killed two people.
 Much of Iowa and parts of several other states suffered outages Monday as straight-line winds toppled trees, snapped poles and downed power lines. The storm known as a derecho had winds of up to 112 mph near Cedar Rapids, as powerful as a hurricane, as it tore from eastern Nebraska across Iowa and into Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana.
 The derecho produced seven tornadoes in the Chicago metropolitan area, including an EF-1 tornado with 110 mph winds that hit the Rogers Park neighborhood on the city's north side before moving onto Lake Michigan as a waterspout, the National Weather Service said.
 That storm left damage along a 3-mile-long path before reaching the lake and was the first tornado of at least EF-1 strength to strike Chicago since a May 29, 1983, storm, the weather service said.
 Another EF-1 tornado that swept through Wheaton, Illinois, knocked over the iconic white steeple atop College Church in the Chicago suburb that is the DuPage County seat.
 The weather service also confirmed two tornadoes in southern Wisconsin and two in northern Indiana, including an EF-1 that swept the rural community of Wakarusa, about 25 miles southeast of South Bend, leaving behind smashed grain bins, damaged barns and farmhouses.
 Crews throughout the region have been working around the clock to restore electricity, but they've been hindered by large trees that are blocking many roads and sitting on top of power lines. Those trees must be removed before power can be restored.
 Iowa's three largest metropolitan areas of Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Davenport still had widespread outages as of Wednesday morning.
 Alliant Energy said about 176,000 of its customers are without power, about half of which are in the Cedar Rapids area. MidAmerican Energy said about 139,000 of its Iowa and Illinois customers remain without power, half them in the Des Moines area.
 As of late Wednesday morning, ComEd reported that about 200,000 of its Chicago-area customers remained without power. Northern Indiana Public Service Co. reported about 18,500 of its Indiana customers were still in the dark.
 Mediacom said Wednesday that it has restored internet service to about half of the 340,000 customers that were offline a day earlier in Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. But many others may be without service until their power is restored, a process that could still take multiple days in places.
 The storm caused extensive crop damage in the nation's No. 1 corn producing state as it tore across Iowa's center from west to east.
 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Tuesday that about 10 million acres of Iowa's nearly 31 million acres of agriculture land sustained damage. About 24 million acres of that is land typically planted primarily in corn and soybeans.
 In addition, tens of millions of bushels of grain that were stored at co-ops and on farms were damaged or destroyed as bins blew away.
 The only known death in Iowa was a 63-year-old bicyclist who was hit by one of several large trees that fell on a bike path outside of Cedar Rapids. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, the storm killed a 73-year-old woman who was found clutching a young boy in her storm-battered mobile home.
 Many businesses, including banks, restaurants and a major corn processing plant in Cedar Rapids, remained closed Wednesday due to power outages.
 The Cedar Rapids school district reported that over 20 of its buildings had roof and other structural damage, ranging from minor to significant, and that it was considering pushing back this month's start date.
 State Sen. Liz Mathis said she took cover in the basement of her suburban Cedar Rapids home Monday as the storm battered her neighborhood for 45 minutes. She said pictures fell of the wall, water seeped in through windows and she worried the glass would blow in and hurt her.
 Mathis said the devastation is widespread across her district, and the "tree damage is unreal." People are waiting an hour or longer at gas stations to fill up their vehicles and get fuel for chain saws, as some are closed or have run out of gas, she said.
 Residents are clearing out their refrigerators and freezers after their food has spoiled. A local utility official told Mathis on Wednesday that it could be a week before everyone's power is restored.
 "The cities are going to look much different without the trees and it's going to take a while to recover from this," she said.

I happened on an article written on July 22 by Zhang Feng discussing how religious low-income residents in the northern province of Shanxi are being coerced to renounce their faith or their welfare benefits will be withdrawn. In April, the government of a town administered by Linfen, called officials from all villages under its jurisdiction for a meeting. The participants were ordered to remove crosses, religious symbols and images from the homes of people of faith who receive social welfare payments and were to replace them with portraits of Chairman Mao and President Xi Jinping. The officials were instructed to annul the subsidies to those who protest the order.
 It somewhat reminded me of the home invasion of the St. Louis couple who were charged with a felony for unlawful use of a weapon for displaying guns as BLM protesters marched outside their home on a private street in a gated community. Police subsequently executed a home search during which their guns were seized, although no crime had been committed. So easy. So wrong.
 So why should they have felt threatened? Let’s look at what’s been going on and more so, where we’re headed.
 Statues of historical figures and now Jesus are currently being vandalized and torn down by anarchists while mayors and governors turn their heads. Whoever thought things would get this far in this country? In 2012, The Democratic Party entertained the idea of completely removing God from their platform, but relented for fear of losing too many votes — but let’s face it, that’s where their head was. Religious freedom is unmistakably under attack by the socialists who are one spit away from being Communists and, guess what, they’re financially in bed with the Chinese.
 One man stands in their way and whether you like him or not, he’s willing to fight your battles with nothing to gain for himself but stress and continuous abuse. Twenty-five years ago we’d say this could never happen here. How long will we be able to say that once the government controls our medical care, businesses, income and retirement? Slavery is having to a roaring revival and the Democrats (in name only) are once again leading the pack.
 Yes, this can happen here. Maybe not to ransom your welfare check because they already own your votes if you’re not wise to them, but what about your health, your livelihood, your kids’ and grandkids’ education and what you’re allowed to buy, sell or own?
 What do they call that when the government controls everything for you and presents it wrapped in the illusion of workers’ ownership? Hint: In an ideal communist system, the workers own all public property and the government represents the workers’ interests. Everyone works for the common good and receives only the property they need, effectively eliminating the gap between rich and poor. Sound ideal? A definition of which Karl Marx would heartily approve.
 History and religion get in the way of this “progressive” movement. You worship the government because it answers all your needs as it controls you. This direction requires only a left turn at the voting booth. Something to think about.

With yet another late innings failure, the Mariners fell to 7-13 in the first 20 games. To be fair, the bullpen isn't responsible for all 13 of those losses, it only feels that way for fans.
 "Giving young guys opportunities in those spots are really, really valuable and they will learn from it and will benefit from it down the road," manager Scott Servais said. "It was just a little painful tonight when you don't get the W after I thought we were in control of that ballgame."
 With a 4-2 lead going into the bottom of the eighth, Servais turned to Swanson, who has looked dominant in his previous outing, firing fastballs that touched 97 mph with riding movement and a high spin rate.
 Days ago, Swanson, a former starter who averaged 93 mph with his fastball last season, talked about being able to consistently hit 98-99 mph with his fastball in his next outing.
 He did just that on multiple occasions vs. the Rangers. But the idea of commanding the ball to certain areas of the strikezone faded and the control of actually throwing a strike dissipated.
 The eighth became a nightmare for all involved, well, except the Rangers.

NACOGDOCHES, Texas (KTRE) - No announcement will be coming from the Southland Conference on Wednesday night but one could be made on Thursday for the future of fall sports.On Wednesday afternoon, presidents from the member schools met on a conference call for over two hours but no announcement was made. A source close to those meetings believes an announcement could be made Thursday morning at the earliest. Info coming out from media members around Texas point to a possible non-conference schedule in the fall for football with all conference contest in fall sports taking place in the spring. It is a move done by other F-C-S level conferences.Last week the conference was confident that fall sports could go on but those thoughts have lessened it seems with the NCAA return to play protocols and several schools pausing fall camps. McNeese and Sam Houston delayed the start of camp. Lamar started but quickly paused fall camps after a significant amount of student-athletes tested positive for COVID-19.As of last week, SFA had nine student-athletes on campus had tested positive for COVID-19. SFA is testing athletes weekly and doing surveillance testing when needed. Both are being done with the antigen test which can give results back quickly.“The athletes have been back on campus for about nine weeks and we are Isolated in single dorms, surveillance testing and practicing all the social distancing,” SFA Head football coach Colby Carthel said. “We have created our own bubble. We have changed our practices, our masking, social distancing. I feel very confident with our players and we take it one day at a time.”As of now SFA is set to open the season at SMU on September 12. There is a chance that the team could grab up another game on September 5 That was the original season opener at Alabama A&amp;M but it went away when the SWAC announced they were moving to spring football.“We don’t know who the first opponent will be but we have to be ready to answer the call when it is made,” Carthel said. “You want to train at a high level to be ready. You don’t rise to the occasion, you fall to the level you are training. We try to work hard and practice at a high level each and every day. "If college football proceeds in the fall in the Southland, for SFA and Sam Houston the annual Battle of the Pineywoods will need to find a new home.Lone Star Sports and Entertainment, which facilitates the event for NRG Stadium with the Houston Texans announced that the stadium would not host the 2020 event. The event had been held in Houston since 2010. SFA won that game but had not won since 2011.Southland Conference leaders are set to meet Wednesday at 4 pm to discuss the future of football. The SFA administration has been vocal about moving forward with fall football.“I am looking forward to playing in the fall and I hope Sam Houston is wanting to play in the fall but that is to be determined on their campus,” Carthel said. “If we are the Battle of the Pineywoods will proceed and we may have to pick a neutral site like Crockett High School some eveining in October but we will find a place to play.”The game is set to take place on October 3.Copyright 2020 KTRE.

Integration of TBS biometrics with a variety of third-party access control systems is easy. A "middleware" subsystem is connected to the network. Readers are connected to the subsystem and also to the corporate access control system. An interface with the TBS subsystem coordinates with the access control system. For example, a thermal camera used as part of the biometric reader can override the green light of the access control system if a high temperature (suggesting COVID-19 infection, for example) is detected.

Minister of Regional Cooperation Ofir Akunis (Likud) told _Reshet Bet_ this morning that his party has no intention of pushing for early elections.
 "Israel needs a budget, not elections," he said. "Those ministers of the Blue & White party [who are promoting the budget dispute] are going against the will of the voter. It's perfectly possible to make changes to the coalition accords [which stipulate a two-year budget]," he insisted. "Nothing terrible will happen if we do that."
 Akunis added that, "No one in the Likud is planning for elections. It's not our policy, and it's not the policy of the Prime Minister either, who knows full well that elections would not be the right thing for the country at this point. A two-year budget is the right way to go in principle - however, the current situation demands a reassessment."

 However, Graham won going away in Williamstown where he serves as chairman of the of the Select Board and Lefebvre finished a strong second. Graham received 377 votes in his home town, followed by Lefebvre with 208 and Cole with 108.
 Graham also carried Washington and Corinth, though the vote totals there were much smaller, as was the gap between first and third place.
 In Washington, Graham received 74 votes, Lefebvre got 65 and Cole finished with 43. Graham and Cole ran neck and neck in Corinth with Graham receiving 58 votes, Cole 55 and Lefebvre 46.
 That left Orange, where Town Clerk Angela Eastman offered a blunt assessment of her Board of Civil Authority following what she characterized as a frustrating hand-counting experience that was suspended shortly before she headed for home at 2 a.m. Wednesday.

 Eastman didn’t elaborate, but suggested the board needed new blood.
 “It was a mess,” she said.
 While that “mess” created some lingering uncertainty in the Republican primary, there was no such drama on the Democratic side. With five of six towns reporting Rep. Carl Demrow, D-Corinth and Kate MacLean, who like Cole was elected to the Chelsea Select Board in March, each enjoyed a sizable leads over former lawmaker and Washington resident.
 Hatch-Davis finishes a distant third in Chelsea, Corinth and Vershire ran a close third in Washington and narrowly claimed second place in Williamstown finishing 12 votes ahead of Demrow.
 Hatch-Davis did finish first in Orange – by one vote – but by the time those results were reported late Wednesday morning the race was long over.
 Demrow narrowly finished first in the district-wide race with 693 votes. MacLean received 687 votes and Hatch-Davis, who also lost her concurrent bid in a contested primary for Orange County’s lone Senate seat, finished third with 405 votes.
 Based on the unofficial results the race in November will include both incumbents and pit Graham and Lefebvre against Demrow and MacLean. Williamstown Independent Rama Schneider will also be on the ballot in the two- member district.

In July, the NCCC Board of Trustees approved the hiring of Matt Hansen as the new assistant wrestling coach. This spot was made available after the resignation of former assistant wrestling coach Gunnar Woodburn, who was at NCCC for only a year. Hansen’s first official day will be Monday.
 “I’m very excited about it. I’m really looking forward to it. I think I’m really going to enjoy the area, the town, the school, and working with coach (Nick) Nothern,” Hansen said. “I haven’t met many of the guys on the team. I met a few and talked to some on the phone. ... I haven’t met a lot of the other coaching staff and administration, but I talked to some of them over the phone. And I think I’m really going to enjoy it here.”
 Hansen, 47, was enjoying his wrestling career at Doane University last year. With the wrestling community being so close-knit, Hansen found out that there was an assistant coaching vacancy at NCCC. Hansen went through the application process, and NCCC wrestling coach Nothern thought Hansen was just the man for the job.
 “I’ve known Matt through his brother for a long time,” Nothern said. “They come from a wrestling family and I know Matt is very knowledgeable and had lots of contacts to help with recruiting. I liked that he’s been coaching longer than I have and I hope to learn from him. I hope we can make each other better coaches.”
 It’s a small wrestling world, and little did both know that they eventually meet in their respective circle. Hansen has been a college wrestling coach for the past 14 years, beginning his college coaching stint as an assistant at Luther College in Iowa from 2004 to 2008. It was at Luther College where he first met Nothern, who is a three-time NCAA All-American and was a coach at Cornell College. The schools competed against each other.

 Peoria was spotlighted at 7 a.m. Aug. 9 on an episode of "It's How You Get There," telecast on the History pay-TV network.
   
 (We old-timers, those who remember cable TV in the '90s, still call it by its old name, The History Channel.)
   
 The show visits various locations across the country in search of cool modes of individual transportation and cool places to use them. Automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles and boats are included. The edgier, the better.
   
 Episodes this season have explored open spaces in North Dakota, a high- performance driving school in Arizona and ATV trails in a Pennsylvania forest.
   
 "Pleased in Peoria" featured hosts Sam Nehme, who owns motorsports dealerships in Florida, and Julian Taylor, a British former automotive journalist.
   
 Nehme apparently was responsible for the Peoria visit, which took place a few months ago. He is friends with Bob Lindsay, who owns automobile dealerships in Peoria and Galesburg.
   
 Lindsay gave Nehme and Taylor use of some of his vehicles to tool around Peoria. That included a leisurely trip on Grandview Drive, the fabled scenic route along the Illinois River bluff.
   
 "You can tell that the town takes care of the area, and it's gorgeous," Nehme said.
   
 Taylor took particular pleasure in noting former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt is alleged to have called Grandview the world's most beautiful drive.
   
 "This is a very pretty road," Taylor said with full English accent as he navigated. "I wonder what it was like when Teddy Roosevelt drove it. I can see what he was getting at with the view."
   
 At one of the Grandview scenic pullouts awaited J.D. Dalfonso, who leads the local convention and visitors bureau. Dalfonso touted Peoria's history, including its days as a leading distiller and as ancestral home of Caterpillar Inc.
   
 But Dalfonso also revealed to the visitors their next stop -- a private road at the Peoria international airport, where they would be allowed to speed a little.
   
 Speed they did. In one of Lindsay's vehicles, an Acura NSX sports car, Nehme and Taylor hit 140 mph.
   
 Not bad, but a little nervy in a car that lists at $157,500 and isn't theirs. Our palms would be slightly sweaty on the wheel.
   
 Nehme and Taylor also visited Caterpillar's Edwards Demonstration and Learning Center. There they were instructed on how to operate various signature pieces of Caterpillar earthmoving equipment.
   
 The visitors proved adept at handling a 236D3 skid-steer loader, a 323 hydraulic excavator, a 775G quarry truck and a 990K wheel loader. Granted, they had a lot of help, but it all looked good on TV.
   
 "We had a blast and we didn't destroy anything," Nehme said.
   
 The show ended with Nehme and Taylor aboard a less-modern form of transport -- the Spirit of Peoria riverboat. They stood on the deck and waxed rhapsodic about the city as the boat passed the Downtown skyline.
   
 "How cool is this?" Taylor said. "What a cracker view of Peoria as well."
   
 We assume "cracker" means "good," as Taylor used it.
   
 "Smack-bag in the middle of Illinois," he said. "Two-and-a-half hours from Chicago, 2½ hours from St. Louis. Spot on."
   
 The Peoria episode is available to watch on demand at Hulu, Sling TV and Xfinity, among other places.
   
 We'll see how Peoria stacks up against the "It's How You Get There" destination for the next episode on History, to air at 7 a.m. Sunday. It's set in Cleveland.
   
 Not too high a bar for Peoria to clear, is it?

The United States sea services—the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard—are regularly underway and forward-deployed, carrying out routine activities and exercises daily. These activities are technically demanding, expensive, and occasionally dangerous. Consequently, the services face pressure to explain how their typical activities at sea support national strategy, which today means answering how the sea services compete, day-to-day, in an era of strategic competition with great powers. In other words, do the regular functions of the sea services figure in U.S. national strategy, and if not, what must they do to adapt to competition? In so answering that question, we can gain a deeper insight into what it means to compete more fundamentally in the modern era.

PEORIA -- A West Bluff man was sentenced to four years of probation in connection with a shooting incident last fall that left a woman dead.
   
 Marco Brown, 35, of 2007 W. Moss Ave, wasn't charged with the death of Breanna Kelly nor was it was alleged that he fired the fatal shots that killed the 29-year-old woman. Rather, Brown was at a party in the 4000 block of West Virden Court when shots were fired and Kelly, a mother of four, was fatally struck.
   
 He pleaded guilty in May to aggravated discharge of a firearm which alleged he shot at another person. His attorney, Chandra Justice of Peoria, argued her client was at the party when another person, allegedly Nicholas Pannell, came up and struck him. The two started to tussle and Brown was knocked to the ground. He later told police he saw Pannell with a gun, pulled out his weapon and fired.
   
 Brown, who had a FOID card, stuck around after others fled, she said, and tried to save Kelly. Pannell, also 35, was found with a gunshot wound in an automobile police stopped on Big Hollow Road not long after the shooting, authorities stated. The car had been speeding away from the site of the shooting.
   
 Prosecutors sought prison time for Brown, noting that while he wasn't accused of shooting Kelly, he was there and he did bring a weapon to the party. He fired his gun and a person died, they said.
   
 Circuit Judge Kevin Lyons also sentenced Brown to six months in the county jail which he has already served as his case progressed.
   
 Pannell's case for aggravated battery and aggravated discharge, the same charges Brown had faced, is pending. He faces up to 30 years behind bars if convicted of all counts.

Gary and Susan Dalton of Wolf Creek joined the program to “encourage wildlife, birds, wildflowers and native growth,” said Susan who emphasized that their stewardship plan would focus on creating forage and habitats to attract wildlife. Gary and Susan took advantage of a perk in the course — the cost is $110 per ownership, meaning family members or partners are welcome and encouraged to attend at no additional cost.
 Peterson stressed that in the program, “we don’t tell them what to do, but we give them options and help them to learn about the forest and how to manage it for their objective.”
 Since its inception, 171 Forest Stewardship workshops have been attended by 3,848 participants. This means 1.3 of Montana’s four million private acres have benefitted from the program. Recently, there have been second and third- generation participants in the program, wishing to carry on a family legacy through their forest stewardship according to MSU Extension Forestry.
 “A lot of industry land is being sold to private people, who look at the land and realize something needs to be done but they don’t know what it is. They want to know how they can do their best for their forest,” said Peterson, referring to land sold by mining and lumber companies. She also attributes the success of the program to results and word of mouth.
 “We try to revisit landowners again after several years and we get to see the result of people’s management. It’s pretty amazing. The positive changes in their forest are really neat. Then other people see the change in their forests and ask “What did you do? Where did you learn this? Why are you doing this” and word starts spreading around,” she said.
 After the program sessions have ended, the participating landowners will be visited by advisors from the program.
 “When they finish the course they come out with a Forest Stewardship Management Plan … we give them a lot of information about fire resilience, wildlife and range management, best management practices. Then an advisor goes out and visits after the workshop,” said Peterson. These advisors could be from the Forest Service, the DNRC, MSU Extension Forestry specialists and agents, private consulting foresters, as well as many other kinds of Montana industry professionals. According to Peterson, this industry participation combined with private landowners helps to create a state-wide network of support.
 For the past few years, the workshops have all filled up quickly, and currently, there is a waiting list to participate in the program. Those interested in participating in the Montana Forest Stewardship Workshop should fill out the 2021 Forest Stewardship Workshop survey on the MSU Extension Forestry website. This survey will help determine the location of future workshops.
 Started in 1991 and authorized under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 (CFAA), the Forest Stewardship Program’s goal is to “provide quality learning opportunities to landowners who voluntarily seek them. It also assists landowners in developing comprehensive, multi-resource management plans that provide the information needed to manage their forests … according to the goals they have established for their own property,” as stated in “Montana Forest Stewardship Program: A Snapshot” by Jamie B. Yule Ph.D.
 Funding for this program comes from a federal award from the U.S. Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, and is sub-awarded by the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and the Forestry Division to the Montana State University Extension.

The SPLC, however, is an extreme left-wing organization that seldom tells the truth about anything. They are, nevertheless influential in media, corporate, and political circles. Many articles on Google and increasingly in Wikipedia reflect the SPLC’s militant bias and desire to smear and discredit conservative causes and organizations. SPLC and Wikipedia also the use the internet web to smear and demonize Oath Keepers.  SPLC consistently smears organizations defending the Constitution as extreme right, and Wikipedia is now damaging its own reputation for objectivity by following in the shadow of SPLC.

On Saturday mornings at the State Movie Theater in Pawhuska, Oklahoma in the 1950s you could see a black-and-white double feature western where the good guys wore white hats and the bad guys wore black masks. The lines were not blurred. Cowboys, good; rustlers, bad. Lawmen, good; bandana-wearing holdup men, bad. No mask, good; mask, bad.
   
 Today society has divided into two warring factions that are as defined as those satisfying old movie plots but which are themselves not very satisfying. One group champions masks as proof of one's concern for others, and the other group eschews masks as unnecessary and an infringement on individual liberty. However, most of the members of both groups still view cowboys as the good guys.
   
 In my family we had my mother's youngest brother, Uncle Bud, a rodeo cowboy who roped calves and steers. He was one of my heroes even though the mean billy goat he used to practice his roping often butted me across the roping arena.
   
 Another of our family's cowgirl heroines was and is my oldest brother's wife, Shirley Smith Redwine. Sister Shirley competed in barrel racing, pole bending and flag racing for several years at the International Roundup Cavalcade in Osage County, Oklahoma. Shirley was a member of both the Turley, Oklahoma and Sand Springs, Oklahoma round up clubs and she competed as a queen candidate several times. Shirley's mother, Esther, designed and sewed Shirley's fancy outfits and Shirley's father, Hollis, trained her horses. She competed from age 12 until her freshman year at Oklahoma State University, where she met my brother, C.E. Redwine, who managed to win Shirley's heart with his saxophone and ended her rodeo career.
   
 But Shirley has always remained a cowgirl at heart. She knows right from wrong and has always fearlessly championed the right. Cowboys are supposed to stand up and be counted. Shirley did just that when COVID-19 struck our world. She put her sewing skills to work and made masks for our whole family. Now I do not know how many other cowboys and cowgirls have mounted up to confront Ole 19, but I believe true cowboys and cowgirls are not afraid to stand up against any evil. So, cowgirl Shirley, thanks for the masks. Peg and I follow your lead and wear them whenever we go out and about. We do notice there are some folks who do not wear masks. Maybe the rest of the good guys can help get the message out until 'Ole 19 goes the way of the Saturday morning horse operas.
   
 -- James (Jim) M. Redwine was born in Pawhuska, Osage County, Oklahoma. He is a graduate of Pawhuska High School, Indiana University, I.U. School of Law, the Indiana Graduate Judges College and the National Judicial College. He lives at JPeg Osage Ranch in rural Osage County, Oklahoma with his wife, Peg.

On October 17, 2019 reports of a WhatsApp tax of $6 a month, or 20 cents per day, and austerity measures in the proposed 2020 budget ignited nationwide protests. Lebanon ‘the third most indebted country in the world,’ already has some of the most expensive mobile services in the Middle East. Lebanon witnessed nationwide protests against the political elites that have ruled the country through corruption and sectarianism in pursuit of their own interests. Protected by the consociational power-sharing system, these politicians have devised ways to keep each other in power and silence their constituencies under the pretext of safeguarding national peace and preventing sectarian violence. Still, these politicians had their own media and intricate web of clientelism, shared the spoils of the system and were financed by their foreign patrons. The popular uprising that began on the seventeenth of October was reminiscent of the March 2005 Cedar Revolution after the assassination of Rafiq Hariri. But this time protesters crossed sectarian divides and demonstrated unity and social cohesion, because they shared the same grievances of poverty, unemployment, salary stagnation, the high cost of living and lack of public services. In the last 15 to 20 years, these problems had prompted a significant proportion of the country’s well-educated youth to emigrate. The demonstrators chanted ‘the people want the downfall of the political system,’ ‘regime change,’ ‘all of them must step down,’ ‘power to the people,’ ‘down with the rule of the Central Bank,’ ‘Revolution,’ ‘civil state without a sectarian system.’ Although the demonstrators formed ad hoc committees, they were disorganized and they lacked uniform voice and demands. They were scattered, exhibiting no unified leadership or ideology, and did not propose a feasible alternative to the current government. It is important to note that the ‘political parties reacted swiftly in an attempt to harness the protests for their benefit.’ Therefore, with no horizon for the popular uprising to bear fruit the politicians aimed at sowing discord between the demonstrators to stop their socio-political movement.

A suspect in an Aug. 5 strong-armed robbery in Calvert County is behind bars after being apprehended last weekend in Washington, D.C., police reported.
 According to court records, Dion Lamont Parker, 20, of District Heights, is charged with robbery, theft of $100 to under $1,500, second-degree assault and theft scheme of $100 to under $1,500. Parker is being held without bond.
 Detective Joshua Buck stated in a police report that at approximately 11:44 p.m. on Aug. 5 he responded to the 7-Eleven store on Chesapeake Beach Road in Dunkirk to investigate a robbery. The sheriff’s office had received a 911 about 12 minutes earlier.
 The detective interviewed the store clerk who stated a man entered the store and placed an energy drink can on the counter “as if to pay for it,” Buck stated in court documents. “The suspect then left the store for about a minute and came back into the store. The suspect then walked behind the counter and forcibly took approximately $600 cash from [the clerk’s] hand, which he was in the process of putting into an electronic safe. The suspect then took the entire register drawer and left the store.”
 According to Buck, the clerk estimated that $300 was in the register drawer.
 “The suspect then left the scene in a newer model gray hardtop Ford Mustang with noticeable damage to the front passenger quarter panel,” Buck stated, adding that the getaway vehicle was seen driving through the parking lot of a nearby gas station and then left the area on eastbound Route 260.
 Crime scene technicians were able to get the suspect’s finger prints from the can of energy drink. Surveillance videos from the 7-Eleven and the gas station were also reviewed. The sheriff’s office license plate reader at the Route 4 and Route 260 intersection was also reviewed.
 According to police accounts, Parker’s apprehension occurred after a Prince George’s County police officer who resides in Calvert County noticed the suspect’s gray Mustang in Suitland. The officer attempted to stop Parker’s vehicle at the Suitland Parkway-Silver Hill Road intersection. A pursuit finally ended on Alabama Avenue in Southeast Washington, D.C. After a brief foot chase, Parker was arrested.
 Court records indicate that after being held in a D.C. jail over the weekend, a warrant was served Monday by Calvert authorities. Parker is also facing charges in D.C. and Prince George’s related to the police chase.
 Investigation of the Dunkirk robbery is ongoing and anyone with information that could aid in that probe is asked to contact Buck at 410-535-2000, ext. 2765, or by email at Joshua.Buck@calvertcountymd.gov.

For much of the night, batter after batter chased the two starting pitchers out of the zone, and Gonsolin and Davies took advantage of home plate umpire Lance Barrett’s generous interpretation of where the bottom of the strike zone was.
 Gonsolin struck out eight in his 4 2/3 innings. The 26-year-old right-hander, recalled earlier in the day, allowed successive one-out singles to Trent Grisham and Manny Machado in the first inning before retiring the next 11 batters he faced until Wil Myers’ walk leading off the fifth. Mixing a split- fingered fastball and slider with equal effectiveness, he struck out the side in the second and fourth innings.
 Profar’s fading single into right field prompted Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to pull his rookie pitcher and insert Blake Treinen, who struck out Fernando Tatis Jr. Tatis, who entered the games with a nine-game hitting streak and 18-game on-base streak, was 0-for-4.
 Davies continued to be deceptively precise, throwing his creeping high-80s fastball and dodgy change-up along the edges of the strike zone and just outside of it to get through seven innings on 87 pitches while repeatedly escaping a modicum of trouble.

Blythe voters last saw a City Council election in November 2017, where four candidates – including one incumbent – vied for three seats.
 The total vote count, per the Riverside County Registrar of Voters’ final official election results, was 2,838.
 “The City Council consists of five (5) members, elected by the City at-large, who serve four-year staggered terms. After each election, the City Council appoints a Mayor and a Vice-Mayor from its own membership to serve a two year term. The Mayor is responsible for presiding over City Council meetings, representing the City Council at various business and ceremonial events, and executing all ordinances, resolutions and contracts,” states the City of Blythe. “The Vice-Mayor performs these duties in the absence of the Mayor. As a legislative body, the City Council is responsible for the enactment of local laws (ordinances), the adoption of the City’s annual Operating and Capital Budget, review and adoption of proposed policies, agreements, contracts and other City business items. The City Council also sits as the governing board for the Succ(e)ssor Agency to the Blythe Redevelopment Agency.”
 Per the Riverside County Registrar of Voters, the November 2020 ballot will also have four special and school districts as well.
 Palo Verde Healthcare District will have three vying for two seats, with Samuel Burton (incumbent), Stacy R. Davis, and Trina Renee Sartin (incumbent) qualified as candidates.
 Palo Verde Unified School District will have four vying for three seats, with Alfonso “Sonny” Hernandez (incumbent), Jamey Mullion (incumbent), Samuel Burton (incumbent), and Diana M. Esquibel Méndez qualified as candidates.
 The Palo Verde Valley Library District (PVVLD) had no candidates listed for three open seats.
 Palo Verde Community College District (PVCCD) will have two appearing on the ballot for two seats, with Stella Camargo-Styers (incumbent) and Stacy R. Davis qualified as candidates.
 Due to the PVVLD and PVCCD having incumbents who did not file before the Aug. 7 deadline, an extension (for persons other than the incumbents) with a deadline of Aug. 12 has been made available to the public.

 Often homeless and hobbled by drug addiction and mental illness, she spent decades on and off the streets. But her performances almost always left an impression, sometimes drawing the ire of merchants. Still, she befriended many residents, including a former mayor.
 She was estranged from her family, so she relied on friends and acquaintances to keep her company, give her money and supplies and occasionally arrange for meals at local restaurants. Needing to make a few extra bucks, she would stop passers-by outside Clark's restaurant, Willoughby's coffee shops or theaters at Yale and ask to perform a scene from Shakespeare.
 Holloway would then take a breath, steady herself and then begin reciting, her mouth quivering, eyes wide. Her delivery at times seemed as if she was singing. It was often Holloway and an audience of one. The performance lasted just a few minutes.
 “It was a way to maintain her dignity,” said Joan Channick, who met Holloway in the early 1990s and remained a friend until her death.
 “She wasn’t standing on the street corner panhandling or begging for money. She was offering something in return for a contribution,” said the chair of Yale's theater management department.
 The interactions could sometimes be friendly — she was known for her big smile and tendency to greet regulars by name — or a little intimidating if she was on drugs and looking gaunt and disheveled.

On October 21, Hariri announced a list of 17 reforms approved by the government that proposed to cut the deficit and expedite administrative reforms without increasing taxes on the people. After a few days Aoun addressed the Lebanese for the first time since the beginning of the protests. He supported the idea that Hariri’s economic reform plan would save Lebanon, vowed to work toward a civil state and promised to implement a unified personal status law. However, the Lebanese had lost trust in their rulers and were tired of undelivered promises for decades. On October 29, Hariri announced that he had reached a dead end and tendered his resignation, arguing that Lebanon needed a ‘shock’ to be saved. Clearly, Hariri’s resignation ‘was largely motivated by his failure to gain support, in particular from Hezbollah, for a cabinet reshuffle that could have given him a freer hand to govern.’ Hariri’s resignation put an end to the presidential deal that brought Aoun to the presidency. What followed were months of wrangling over a new government formation while the ‘Lebanese economy went into a tailspin proved the political elite’s indifference to ordinary citizen’s plight.’ During the second half of October 2019 the closure of public and private institutions and banks added uncertainty and loss of trust. Still, in the case of the banks, warnings of impending liquidity and persistent closures further undermined confidence, and government officials and opposition activists warned of a financial meltdown.

In response, Israel has closed a goods crossing with Gaza and slashed the territory's permitted coastal fishing zone, as well as launching air strikes on sites owned by the enclave's rulers Hamas.
 "Over the last week, explosive balloons are being launched from the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory," the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) said in a statement early Thursday.
 "In response, a short while ago, IDF fighter jets and tanks struck a number of Hamas military targets in the Gaza Strip."
 The army said the strikes were aimed at a military compound and observation posts used by Hamas militants, who also fired a volley of rockets into the sea this week after repeated exchanges of fire.
 A Gaza security source said Israeli warplanes had carried out several strikes on Hamas sites.
 They said the strikes caused severe damage to the sites and some damage to citizens' homes, but did not report any injuries.
 Israeli fire services in the south of the country reported 60 fires caused by balloons on Tuesday, and 24 on Wednesday, without recording any casualties.
 Hamas and Israel have fought three wars since 2008.
 Despite a truce last year backed by the UN, Egypt and Qatar, the two sides clash sporadically with rockets, mortar fire or incendiary balloons.
 The Gaza Strip has a population of two million, more than half of whom live in poverty, according to the World Bank.
 Palestinian analysts say fire from Gaza often aims to pressure Israel to give the green light for the transfer of Qatari financial aid into the strip.

COSHOCTON -- The 50th annual Apple Butter Stirrin' Festival in Roscoe Village has been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the historic recreation of a canal era town is moving forward in connecting with individuals anew.  
 The Roscoe Village Foundation Visitors Center and historic tours were closed from early March to early June. Mary Ellen Given, foundation executive director, said large groups aren't coming through right now. Most of their tourists are couples and family groups. That's typical for this time of year. Given said numbers haven't been as strong as other summers, but still solid considering the pandemic.  
 Given said after consulting with the Coshocton City Health Department, and the fact that such mass gatherings have yet to be cleared by the state, it was decided to cancel the Apple Butter Festival in the best interest of public safety. They hope to hold the festival again from Oct. 15 to 17, 2021.  
 Several vendors and entertainers for the event were already booked and Given said they didn't want to wait until the last moment to cancel the event.  
 "Our fear is that we would get it planned, have food vendors line their food up, have crafters make things and then have it canceled within days of the event," Given said. "A late cancellation would cause additional financial hardships to vendors, musicians and others who have already suffered from multiple event cancellations this year."  
 Mason Mizer and Alivia Mourer of Ridgewood FFA stir apple butter during the 49th annual Apple Butter Stirrin' Festival in 2019. This year's event has been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic with plans to return next October.  
 Plans for the holiday candle lightings in December are still up in the air. Given said they're already discussing some creative alternatives to the candle lightings if they can't be held in the usual fashion.  
 Roscoe Village, a restored 1800s canal town, already had plans for some new features this summer that have still debuted.  
 The Hay Building, next to the blacksmith's shop, has been revamped this summer as an activity center. Given said when Raymond Hay donated the building, he wanted it to be a craft and learning center. Patrons can buy a ticket and do as many crafts as they wish. This including weaving, tinsmithing, making a whisk broom, leather work and more.  
 "It's a great way for folks to learn how things would have been done," Given said. "A lot of these things we think of as crafts today, they were trades back in that day. Now, to see how that's done and to try to make it yourself is great."  
 A recently added element is video kiosks in the historic buildings. One can press a button and see a short video of what would have been done in that building and what life was like during the canal era. There are seven videos about five to seven minutes long. They feature some local actors and employees of the village.  
 For example, showing how printing was done from start to finish from a person dressed in costume. Interpreters are still there and can add more details, but Given said the videos give a more overall picture.  
 "We can't do that on a tour, because it takes too long," Given said of showing the complete process.  
 She said it's trying to take some of the traditional ways they've taught history and blend it with a modern sensibility, especially to engage with children.  
 "Now people are so visually inclined. Kids are used to watching TV or watching videos. To actually take them on a tour and say 'back 160 years ago you would have done this.' They cannot visualize it," Given said.

The objective of maritime security (or, good order at sea) is to sustain and enforce the rule of law, to promote the mutual gains that encourage nations to trust in and rely on the United States, and to protect the legitimate uses of global commons that keep the world prosperous and safe from major conflict. To maintain the U.S. position at the helm of the international order is to pursue maritime security. To fail to pursue maritime security is to concede rulemaking and rule breaking to competitors, creating a less desirable and beneficial order and thus facilitating its erosion or corrosion. Countries that fall further from the U.S.-led order will have China (and to a lesser extent, Russia) to turn to as partners in facilitating the construction of robust alternatives.

After competing each week in the Junior Tour events throughout Southern Maryland, a number of local golfers looked to continue their winning ways in a Regional Tournament at the River Marsh Golf Course at the Hyatt Regency in Cambridge, Md. last weekend.
 Trevor Simpson, a rising sophomore at La Plata High School, was the low medalist in the 14-18 age bracket on Sunday with a 74, one shot better than Conor Gallagher, a rising senior at Gonzaga High School in Washington, D.C. Kirsten Vanderhorst, a Bowie resident and rising junior at Bishop McNamara in Prince George’s County, also placed in the top five with a 77.
 “Our kids fought through the heat and the tough conditions and played tremendously,” said Southern Maryland Golf Director Sean Bannon. “The Southern Maryland players brought home two pieces of hardware and finished second overall to a team from the Baltimore Region.”
 In the 10-13 age group, Owen Newberry (Crofton Middle School) finished sixth with a 77, two shots better than Connor Wilbur who took ninth. In the 6-9 age group, Ryan Ritchie finished tied for third with a nine-hole total of 39, while Luke Gladfelter (42) and Ashton Bryant (43) both placed in the top 15.
 “I could not be more proud of all the kids who showed up and played through the heat and tough conditions,” said Bannon, incoming coach of the Calvert High School golf team. “For a lot of these kids, this was their first go at 18 holes. I’m ecstatic with how the kids performed and the SoMd Region finished second overall in the standings.”
 On Sunday, Bannon confirmed that a number of local golfers will be headed to Disney World in Orlando, Fla. for the Junior Tour National tournament slated for Aug. 7-9. In the 14-18 group, Simpson, Shelby Herbert (La Plata], Nicholas Finamore (Calvert), Jessica Murphy (Patuxent), Ryan Graves (Westlake) and Blake Nichols and David Wright, both of Huntingtown, will be competing.
 In the 10-13 age group, Philip Verghese, Jason Dacanay and Owen Newberry will be heading south, while Joslen Bannon, Ashton Bryant, Ryan Ritchie and Austin Jarrell will represent the locals from the 6-9 age group. Ritchie recently finished tied for 14th among seven-year-olds in the July 30-Aug. 1 World Championships at Mid Pines Inn and Golf Club in North Carolina.
 “I look forward to seeing all of these local kids who are heading down to Florida [this weekend],” Bannon said. “For those kids that could not make the trip, I look forward to seeing all of them at our first Junior Tour fall event next month [September 12] at Chesapeake Hills.”

“This might sound crazy to some people but I actually saw more progression and consistency with shooting, more improvement with ball-handling and more improvement of understanding where to go with making cuts and so forth, and that’s because everything was practice-focused instead of focused on going out and playing in games,” the second-year head coach explained.
 “We have had this thing backwards for several years and I think other coaches would agree that over the last several years the emphasis has shifted from going out and doing those boring drills that make you a better player to going out and playing 10 games in a weekend. That has not been good for fundamental development. One of our more experienced players said to me, ‘We should have been doing this the whole time’ and I sort of giggled and laughed and said, this is exactly what I was trying to get everyone to do last summer.”
 Pierson used the voluntary three-week practice period to focus exclusively on fundamentals, installing sets and to evaluate both the program’s newcomers and the progression of the returners. In a typical summer practice period the Tribe would have participated in multiple shootouts, but Pierson believed this year’s set-up was much more beneficial in the development of his team.
 “As far as being able to get players up to speed and helping them develop skills that they are going to need to help the team, I did like that much better,” he admitted. “What I would like is to have had one or two shootouts to go to in that three-week period so they could see the improvement in their own skills.
 “It’s not that playing games doesn’t have a purpose, it does. It helps you gain experience and some things that you need, but we need to be playing less games in the offseason and players need to be working on their skills more.”
 Pierson hopes the upward trajectory of a team that returns the lion’s share of its production continues for the remainder of the offseason and he noted the summer had been incredibly beneficial for everyone who participated.
 “There’s no question that when we show up for the season that several of them who didn’t play last year will be up to speed quicker and be more familiar with what we like to do both offensively and defensively,” he opined. “We had the most enthusiasm and greatest number of players participating in the three- week period since I have been an assistant or a head coach.”

 On Saturday mornings at the State Movie Theater in Pawhuska, Oklahoma in the 1950s you could see a black-and-white double feature western where the good guys wore white hats and the bad guys wore black masks. The lines were not blurred. Cowboys, good; rustlers, bad. Lawmen, good; bandana-wearing holdup men, bad. No mask, good; mask, bad.
 Today society has divided into two warring factions that are as defined as those satisfying old movie plots but which are themselves not very satisfying. One group champions masks as proof of one's concern for others, and the other group eschews masks as unnecessary and an infringement on individual liberty. However, most of the members of both groups still view cowboys as the good guys.
 In my family we had my mother's youngest brother, Uncle Bud, a rodeo cowboy who roped calves and steers. He was one of my heroes even though the mean billy goat he used to practice his roping often butted me across the roping arena.
 Another of our family's cowgirl heroines was and is my oldest brother's wife, Shirley Smith Redwine. Sister Shirley competed in barrel racing, pole bending and flag racing for several years at the International Roundup Cavalcade in Osage County, Oklahoma. Shirley was a member of both the Turley, Oklahoma and Sand Springs, Oklahoma round up clubs and she competed as a queen candidate several times. Shirley's mother, Esther, designed and sewed Shirley's fancy outfits and Shirley's father, Hollis, trained her horses. She competed from age 12 until her freshman year at Oklahoma State University, where she met my brother, C.E. Redwine, who managed to win Shirley's heart with his saxophone and ended her rodeo career.
 But Shirley has always remained a cowgirl at heart. She knows right from wrong and has always fearlessly championed the right. Cowboys are supposed to stand up and be counted. Shirley did just that when COVID-19 struck our world. She put her sewing skills to work and made masks for our whole family. Now I do not know how many other cowboys and cowgirls have mounted up to confront Ole 19, but I believe true cowboys and cowgirls are not afraid to stand up against any evil. So, cowgirl Shirley, thanks for the masks. Peg and I follow your lead and wear them whenever we go out and about. We do notice there are some folks who do not wear masks. Maybe the rest of the good guys can help get the message out until 'Ole 19 goes the way of the Saturday morning horse operas.
   
 -- James (Jim) M. Redwine was born in Pawhuska, Osage County, Oklahoma. He is a graduate of Pawhuska High School, Indiana University, I.U. School of Law, the Indiana Graduate Judges College and the National Judicial College. He lives at JPeg Osage Ranch in rural Osage County, Oklahoma with his wife, Peg. Jim and Peg have 3 grown children, 7 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

Executives want IT systems that can adapt as the business changes. And here they often resort to a tempting two-for-one deal. As a short-term fix, patching old systems makes sense to many executives. While patching works in the moment, however, it treats a symptom rather than the underlying problem. Many companies also race to lift-and-shift their applications, as is, from legacy systems to the cloud, hoping for cost benefits. These reasonable choices miss the point.

"There are 107 school districts that have not submitted their plan - for those 107 school districts, how they didn't submit a plan is beyond me. If they don't submit a plan by this Friday, they can't open," Governor Cuomo said. "The main arbiter here of whether a school district has an intelligent plan to reopen and whether people have confidence in that district's plan: It's going to be the parents and it's going to be the teachers, and that requires discussion, and that's going to be a dialogue. Parents don't have to send their child. The parents are responsible for the health and safety of the child, and they're not going to send the child if they don't believe the plan makes sense. A teacher is not going to come back into the classroom if they think the classroom is not safe, and that's right. The school district has to have that dialogue by the 21st to fully comply with our rules."

Dear Editor,
   
 Public/preventative health is not a " glamorous " part of the scope of medicine, compared to heart transplants, emergency room drama, cancer cures, etc. But, public/preventative health measures save more lives than any other of the various medical fields. When I arrived here to start practice in 1972, there was no Public Health Department. Now, we have a state of the art, well planned building with a dedicated staff serving our community ( I recently had a Covid 19 test, and had results in  but from the state's control of some functions of our health department. We have excellent funds, but we are not always allowed to use them to the fullest extent because of state guidelines. This is changing some, and Mr. Jones is representing our needs very well. I want Pawhuskans to be proud of their Health Department -- it took a long time, and a lot of work, to have what we have.
   
 Another thought: Shouldn't we wear masks in public, to protect others from catching an unexpected Corona Virus infection from us? We wear clothes in public, as a (?) moral mandate. Shouldn't we wear masks at this time, as a health mandate?
   
 Sincerely,
   
 Michael L. Jordan, M.D.

 Often homeless and hobbled by drug addiction and mental illness, she spent decades on and off the streets. But her performances almost always left an impression, sometimes drawing the ire of merchants. Still, she befriended many residents, including a former mayor.
 She was estranged from her family, so she relied on friends and acquaintances to keep her company, give her money and supplies and occasionally arrange for meals at local restaurants. Needing to make a few extra bucks, she would stop passers-by outside Clark's restaurant, Willoughby's coffee shops or theaters at Yale and ask to perform a scene from Shakespeare.
 Holloway would then take a breath, steady herself and then begin reciting, her mouth quivering, eyes wide. Her delivery at times seemed as if she was singing. It was often Holloway and an audience of one. The performance lasted just a few minutes.
 “It was a way to maintain her dignity,” said Joan Channick, who met Holloway in the early 1990s and remained a friend until her death.
 “She wasn’t standing on the street corner panhandling or begging for money. She was offering something in return for a contribution,” said the chair of Yale's theater management department.
 The interactions could sometimes be friendly — she was known for her big smile and tendency to greet regulars by name — or a little intimidating if she was on drugs and looking gaunt and disheveled.

If I had just heard those stories without the background, the way we are presented so much news today, I could be expected to say, well, there is a way one is supposed to behave when a significant other changes, so one woman was right and one was wrong.
 But I did know the backgrounds. I knew that my relative’s wife had spent a lifetime with her husband and, through the meanness, see the person he used to be and choose to remember that and honor it. And I knew my colleague was facing a lifetime with someone who had become a stranger, nothing like the person she had fallen in love with.
 Because I knew the context, I could not say I disagreed with either decision. There were no hard-and-fast rules of life in play, just a struggle toward the least objectionable of bad choices.
 Robin Williams once said something that has stuck with me. On first hearing, it sounded wise, in a superficial way, but it took on the poignancy of a tough self-examination when we later learned how tortured his mind was.
 “Everyone you meet,” he said, “is fighting a battle you know nothing about.”
 He added a coda that I would not have: “Be kind. Always,” I might have said something like, “Take a breath. Think about it.” Sometimes, even when you know people’s battles, you are forced to conclude that they still might be jerks. From “take a breath” to “still a jerk” seems a much easier trip to me than from “be kind” to “still a jerk.”
 But I appreciate the wisdom of trying to put someone’s words and deeds into a broader perspective, striving for empathy, looking for context.
 In so many ways today, we live in a world without context.
 We are presented with dire either-or choices (what logicians call bifurcation or a false dichotomy) and told we must pick one or the other. A choice between killing the economy or risking widespread death, between wokeness and racism, between Trump and Never Trump, past sins and current sensibilities, law-and- order and oppression, liberty and license.
 There are times when we must recognize clear, bright lines, between right and wrong, good and evil, even productive and wasteful. But there are times when the question isn’t whether there is a line but where to put it. In our own lives, we seek a balance between self-interest and our duty to others. In our greater society, the eternal goal is to balance liberty and equality.
 When to draw a line and when to move it. I think it takes a lifetime and then some to work that out, but it’s the worthiest of struggles.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record and signaling enthusiasm among Democrats following the selection of the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket.
 “It's really palpable, the excitement,” Biden said Wednesday.
 The campaign hopes the haul is the beginning of a prolific fundraising push in the final stretch before Election Day. Democrats are close to matching, if not surpassing, the massive $300 million cash stockpile President Donald Trump and Republicans reported in July.
 Harris is expected to play a key role in that effort. She joined Biden in Delaware on Wednesday for their first fundraiser together as running mates, where she talked to grassroots donors about how her parents' activism inspired her interest in politics.
 “This is a campaign that really fuels my hope because it is about knowing that this is fighting for something and not against something and it’s fighting for the best we are as a nation,” Harris said. “It’s fighting for the best of who we can be.”
 With large in-person events out of the question due to the pandemic, the campaign has an aggressive schedule of online fundraisers planned for Harris. That could play to one of her political strengths and offset an area where Biden has sometimes struggled.
 Harris already has a robust network of donors in her native California, a state that has long been referred to as the ATM of the Democratic Party. She can rake in cash from Wall Street. And Harris, who is also of Asian descent, has the potential to bring new money into the Democratic fold due to the historic nature of her candidacy.

To prepare red rocks, I simply rinse them off, allow them to dry, and slip them into gallon freezer-grade plastic bags. I use a straw to suck the air out of the bag after I have the zipper closed 99% of the way. That minimizes frost on the tomatoes in the freezer.
 To use frozen tomatoes, I just run hot water from the faucet over them. The skin thaws quickly, and rubs right off. Or I’ll drop a few in a pan of hot water. That helps to thaw the tomatoes and makes them easier to chop up for use. If I freeze cherry tomatoes, I don’t bother removing the skins before cooking with them.
 I have a couple of food dehydrators that I use to dry tomatoes, too. The Cadillac of dehydrators is the Excalibur. Mine is a $300 deluxe model that blows hot air sideways equally over all nine trays. My other is the NESCO American Harvester, a serviceable machine that pushes air up or down through a stack of trays.
 The downside to the NESCO model is you must rotate the trays to get equal drying. And it uses 1,000 watts of energy per hour, while the Excalibur uses only 660 watts. Still, at about $125 for the basic machine, it is more affordable. You can stack up to 30 round 15-inch trays over the fan and heating element, but the more trays you add, the longer it takes to dry all the food. I find about eight trays is as many as I want to stack.
 Most summers, I grow eight to 12 Sun Gold tomato plants, and each is prolific. Most of the fruit I dry in my dehydrators. I cut them in half and dry, cut side up. I store them in zipper bags in the fridge or freezer, and use them in soups and stews. Dried tomatoes can be stored in the pantry, too.
 Sometimes I dry plum or slicing tomatoes. I cut them about 3/8 of an inch thick. They tend to stick to the trays, so be sure to buy the special no-stick screens to put on the trays. That makes clean up much easier.

Just a couple of weeks ago, volunteer conditioning opened up for high school student athletes across Southern Maryland. Despite the MPSSAA officially postponing fall sports, optional workouts were allowed to continue as long as strict guidelines were followed.
 While our student athletes are being monitored by coaches concerned about heat-related illnesses, everyone should be taking the necessary steps to stay healthy while outdoors this time of year.
 A crucial means of staving off heat-related illness, whether practicing at a high school or working in your garden, is to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. “Water will almost always maintain hydration during work in the heat, as long as you eat regular meals to replace salt lost in sweat,” according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 The CDC states that starting the day fully hydrated makes it easier to remain hydrated while working. “If you are dehydrated when you start work, you may not be able to drink enough to catch up with your body’s need for water,” the CDC states.
 The CDC recommends drinking at least 8 ounces of water every 15 to 20 minutes. Drinking water regularly at shorter intervals is better than infrequently downing large quantities, the CDC states. Conversely, do not drink more than 48 ounces of water per hour. That could result in the concentration of salt in your blood becoming too low.
 Make sure you hydrate after work as well. The CDC states that people generally need several hours to replenish fluids they lost through sweat. “Hydrating after work is even more important if you work in the heat on a regular basis. Chronic dehydration increases the risk for a number of medical conditions, such as kidney stones,” the CDC states.
 According to the CDC, sports drinks are OK for maintaining hydration, though they often come with extra sugar. “For prolonged sweating lasting several hours, sports drinks with balanced electrolytes are another option to replace salt lost in sweat,” the CDC states. “Heavy consumption of sports drinks will add unnecessary calories to your diet due to the added sugar.”
 In addition, it is important to know the signs and symptoms of heat-related illnesses.
 According to the CDC, heatstroke is identifiable by a high body temperature, reaching 103 degrees or more; skin that is hot, red, dry or damp; a fast and strong pulse; headache, dizziness, nausea and confusion; and loss of consciousness. The CDC says to call 911 immediately for heatstroke. The person should be moved to a cooler location. Try to lower his or her temperature using cool, wet cloths or a cool bath, but do not give them anything to drink, according to the CDC.
 To alleviate symptoms of heat exhaustion, the CDC recommends moving to a cool place, loosening clothes, using cool, wet cloths or taking a cool bath and sipping water.
 Heat-related illnesses can be avoided by being careful and drinking plenty of water. We encourage everyone to be mindful of how they feel and watchful of others, both on and off athletic fields, to make sure they are not exhibiting any symptoms of heat-related illnesses this summer.

In 2019, the Austin City Council repealed its ban on homeless camping and panhandling after reviewing federal court orders that found such bans unconstitutional.
   
 The move was controversial, and it wasn't long before the Travis County Republican Party backed an effort to restore the ban. Given the clever name "Save Austin Now," the action seemed at the time little more than a public relations stunt.
   
 Still, many were alarmed by the emergence of Austin's homeless from their less conspicuous camps in overgrown green spaces and hidden grottoes.
   
 "Save Austin Now" presented some 24,000 signatures on a petition to place an item on the Nov. 3 ballot that would restore Austin's anti-camping ordinance. City staff recently rejected enough of those signatures to invalidate the petition, placing the issue in limbo as the anti-homeless group threatens legal action.
   
 The coronavirus pandemic complicated the issue, to say the least. Austin and Travis County officials asked residents to shelter in place as the pandemic raged. What could that mean for homeless people, who faced angry demands from some that they not shelter in the places where they put their tents and camps after Austin's ban was lifted?
   
 Ending homelessness, especially among veterans and the young but ideally for all, has been the city's goal. It is a worthy goal shared by the City Council, city staff and the people they represent. It's a goal that reflects Austin's progressive heart.
   
 The council budgeted $62.7 million for homeless services in 2019-20, a 17 percent increase over the previous year. The 2020-21 budget proposal includes $60.9 million. Still, progress is slow. The city purchased the Rodeway Inn on Interstate 35 in November, intending to renovate it and use it as a facility for the homeless. That -- and other concrete plans -- have not yet been completed.
   
 One thought behind Austin's lifting of the camping ban was the recognition that rules prohibiting services to homeless folks who were ticketed for camping were counterproductive. It's like a tragic twist in a story by (one- time Austin resident) O Henry. Efforts to provide shelter to the unsheltered were undone by criminalizing -- and perpetuating -- homelessness.
   
 Heartlessly re-criminalizing homelessness as "Save Austin Now" wants to do is not the answer. It would punish the homeless for our collective failure to do more to end their nightmare. A progressive city like Austin cannot deny shelter to those who need it and then blame them for our failure to find them shelter.
   
 Certainly, the city should have first engaged in a substantive conversation with the public about all that was being done to help people out of homelessness before lifting the camping ban. That might have reduced the anger and alarm.
   
 Now, city staff should learn a lesson from the valiant efforts of workers and volunteers with Caritas, Casa Marianella, Mary House, the Religious Coalition to Assist the Homeless and so many others providing shelter and services to homeless people.
   
 Those workers understand the urgency of their mission and waste little time doing what they can. The city of Austin should do the same. It needs to act with greater haste on its progressive ideas for ending homelessness.
   
 Smith is an author and director of Progress Texas.

Wagner said, “I appreciate the effort of the teachers who were asked to put something together quickly; they are to be commended for their hard work. As a parent and educator though, I was not happy with e-learning during the last few months of the school year, My reasoning is that this crisis exposed that our district does not have vetted curriculum materials that could have been used during this crisis to continue with new learning. While other districts were able to continue with new learning, our students were not able to. Thus our students were given remedial make up work. Curriculum materials are important. Without district-wide curriculum materials, the district was left to create remedial review work packets. This caused a lack of new information being learned with 2 and 1/2 months of school still left. It has been apparent through this process that current leadership believes they know best and are not willing to be transparent, collaborate, and communicate effectively with all stakeholders. In a time when transparency is needed to help settle any fears, collaboration is needed to work with union leadership, and communication is so important to keep everyone on the same page.

"A further two ambulances arrived as he wasn’t responding to the shocks administered and his heart wasn't going back into a normal rhythm.
 "The air ambulance doctor even attended but in a car while they worked on him in the ambulance. He was then taken to Heartlands Hospital where they carried on working to get him back into a stable rhythm.
 "When we arrived at the hospital, as we wasn’t allowed in the ambulance, we spoke to the paramedics who told us that he had 21 shocks to his heart, just in our kitchen, which we was told was the most they have ever administered as well as lots of shots of adrenaline.
 "We waited at the hospital but unfortunately his heart wouldn’t keep stable and they couldn’t carry out surgery to remove the blockage to his heart and he passed away.
 "It was very traumatic for us as it was out of the blue as he hadn’t complained of any pain beforehand. We were all just in total shock.
 "He was much loved and cared for by his family and many friends. Everyone has something to say about his kindheartedness and how he always made everyone laugh. His friends and colleagues have said what a pleasure it was to work with him and learn from him."
 Mark died on June 26 and his funeral was held on July 14.

The NFHS and its member state associations have made great strides to bring the recruiting process back into the schools and away from agents and other third parties. Recruiting a high school athlete with a promise that he or she could eventually earn money at a particular college is a slippery slope that moves education-based high school sports in the wrong direction.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Police have suspended the use of police dogs in apprehensions in light of an arrest earlier this year in which officers ordered a dog to attack a Black man who was kneeling and had already put his hands in the air, the Salt Lake City Police Department said Wednesday.
 Jeffrey Ryans was in his backyard on April 24 when police were called to his home for an alleged domestic dispute, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. They ordered him to get on the ground. Body camera footage shows a police dog latched onto Ryans’ left leg for about 20 seconds even though he was being put in handcuffs.
 The department announced Tuesday it was opening an investigation after Ryans went public with his story. On Wednesday, the department said the officer involved had been placed on administrative leave.

Wednesday, August 12, 2020 was a big day for Baldwin County schools as more than 20,000 students returned to campus. Several thousand more opted for virtual school amid challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. For those returning to traditional school, there are new safety measures in place. Superintendent, Eddie Tyler toured several eastern shore schools to see first- hand how the changes were working out.
 Considering the many hurdles facing schools this fall, school officials said everything went pretty smooth opening day. There were some AC issues at a couple schools that were quickly fixed, and buses ran smoothly. Tyler said he’s pleased with what he saw.
 “The five schools I’ve walked into…I could walk into five schools in Bay Minette. I think it would be the same thing…no mask issues. The faculty’s fantastic. I have not seen one child, high school to elementary school without a mask… …There’s hiccups,” Tyler admitted. “Thirty-one thousand student system. We’re trying to get seven thousand people up and running for virtual school.”
 At Daphne Middle School, enrollment in school is down nearly 25 percent, with more than 200 students studying remotely. Those who went to school found new rules to follow. Classrooms are more spaced out, hallway traffic is one-way, lunch shifts are staggered and of course, masks must always be worn. Assisting school staff are new, thermal cameras at each entry, which help identify students or staff with high temperatures.

BETHLEHEM, Pa. -- As fireworks exploded over Bethlehem Sunday night, ArtsQuest put the wraps on the 37th and most unique edition of Musikfest in its history.
   
 Instead of thousands of people filling the streets and live music coming from stages set up in Bethlehem's parks and plazas, music fans across the nation were treated to 90-plus streaming concerts by artists as diverse as Robert Randolph, KT Tunstall, Alexis P. Suter and Kiran Ahluwalia & Rez Abbasi. In addition, there were still some of the familiar sights and sounds of Musikfest, with five smaller, live shows on the Air Products Town Square at SteelStacks and a special "Fest Food To-Go" area at PNC Plaza at SteelStacks where patrons could purchase take-home food from 10 of the festival's most popular vendors.
   
 "As a community-focused organization, ArtsQuest felt it was more important than ever to keep our community connected through music and the arts during this pandemic and we were committed to presenting a 37th Musikfest," said Kassie Hilgert, the president and CEO of ArtsQuest. "Working with partners like DÜZY TV, Service Electric TV, Discover Lehigh Valley, our local media and others helped us spread awareness of Musikfest and our region well beyond the Lehigh Valley.
   
 "During the week, we had people from more than a dozen countries and 150 cities in the U.S. watch our Virtual Musikfest streams, including individuals as far away as Japan and Peru. We thank our corporate partners, supporting ArtsQuest Members, volunteers, staff, patrons, performers and the local small businesses who came together to present this event for our community and music fans across the globe."
   
 While Musikfest typically draws more than a million people to the city and region, this year the festival shifted gears to keep music fans engaged in new ways while helping to support small businesses and independent artists via initiatives like the Virtual Handwerkplatz online shopping portal and the Fest Food To-Go area on PNC Plaza. ArtsQuest financially supported more than 85 performing artists/musicians, as well as 25 vendors who took part in the 10-day event. Some like Aw Shucks and Hogar Crea made their only area appearances of the summer at Musikfest, much to the delight of fans.
   
 "We feel privileged to participate in ArtsQuest's efforts to provide loyal Musikfest patrons with the ability to still enjoy our food offerings," says Boris Schneider, owner of Island Noodles. "We did rather well considering the circumstances everyone is living and working under right now due to the pandemic."
   
 Without the support of 45 corporate partners and 3,300 supporting ArtsQuest members, there's a good chance there would have been no Musikfest at all this year. Some partners like Wells Fargo and DG Yuengling & Son stepped up in new and innovative ways to help with programming like the "Your HausPlatz Backyard Contest" with Billy Bauer and the photo scavenger hunt on the Musikfest App powered by PNC. Service Electric, a partner since the inaugural Musikfest in 1984, hosted 38 performers from a specially constructed stage in its warehouse, affectionately called GaragePlatz, while also underwriting the costs of the closing-night fireworks.
   
 In most years, the community supports Musikfest by purchasing concert tickets to shows, or food and beverages at the festival. This year, however, it came together to help ArtsQuest in an entirely new way, making donations as part of the One Million 'Festers $500,000 matching gift campaign to help sustain ArtsQuest during the crisis and ensure the festival returns in 2021. The campaign has been gaining momentum with each passing day, with several anonymous donors stepping up behind the scenes to support the nonprofit and the festival.
   
 ArtsQuest, the nonprofit behind Musikfest, typically presents 11 festivals and 1,000 concerts annually, with 50 percent of them free to attend. The organization, however, has essentially been closed since mid-March due to the COVID-19 crisis, losing nearly $20 million in revenue.

The 24-year-old already has one Grand Slam title to her name, winning the French Open last year, which helped her surge to the top of the world rankings where she has stayed since.
 But she can't remember much about her breakthrough at Roland Garros, where she beat Marketa Vondrousova in straight sets in the final.
 "It doesn't feel real, still," Barty said. "That whole match is a bit of a blur, and the lead-up to that (winning) moment is a little bit lost.
 "The best thing was turning around and being able to look at my team, that moment I will never forget," she added.
 Barty admitted to "ups and downs" during her extended layoff this year, but her decision to miss the US Open, which is set to start in New York on August 31, was an easy one given the unpredictability of the pandemic.
 "That was a massive part of it for our team -- accepting that this is something greater than what we can control, we can't do anything about it," she said.
 "We just have to play our part and do the right thing. And then hope we get an opportunity some time in the year to get back to some kind of normal."A handful of other players have also opted out of the US Open, including top-10 players Kiki Bertens and Elina Svitolina, along with men's defending champion Rafael Nadal.

The Wildcats will attempt to run a 6-2 offense with sophomore setter Ella Gardner out there, as well.
 “(Gardner) is very talented,” Blevins said. “She was one of our best athletes when it comes to speed and movement. She is stepping into that 6-2 position… we’re able to have a lot more options.”
 Blevins thinks the Wildcats will still have a good shot of taking home the Southern Nebraska Conference crown.
 “It’s such a wild card,” Blevins said. “They’ve looked really good in open gyms and our team camp. I know we’ll be able to compete because other teams lost their seniors. So, I think we’ll be right in the running for a conference championship, for sure.”
 Despite the uncertainty, Blevins expects the Wildcats, without Kalynn Meyer in the lineup, to be just fine.
 “It’s not like we have a huge hole missing,” Blevins said. “We’ll have to work a little harder to score points, because we don’t have our 6-foot-4 finisher, but Shayla terminates the ball at an extremely high percentage. Sierra, with a year of setting under her belt, gets the ball to the right spot.
 “I guess, instead of them being like ‘Oh my gosh, (Kalynn’s) gone!’ They’re like ‘Alright, it’s our time now!”

She also said that states might turn toward different types of wealth taxes.

“I am pleased with how Nassau School District moved quickly to get our e-learning up and running. We took on a lot of change as new information became available,” Johnson said. “Immediate action began by working to put together a comprehensive plan to meet the needs of our students. Top of the list was feeding them, so food distribution sites were set up. My wife and I assisted at every school that first week and when Bryceville was added, we volunteered there the last 45 days of the school to help our district. We knew that some students would be in need of lap-top computers, so we distributed them and both virtual and paper instruction were employed as automation of internet instruction was provided to students. Many hours were utilized to accomplish such a huge task for a quick turnaround. It was certainly not off the cuff, but a well thought out plan that brought a focused format into play. It took everyone, parents, students and teachers working together to ensure students met County and State Educational requirements to end the school year. Nassau School District continues to move forward and should another Pandemic situation occur, we are ready to implement a plan for instruction again.”

 Dear Editor,
 Public/preventative health is not a \" glamorous \" part of the scope of medicine, compared to heart transplants, emergency room drama, cancer cures, etc. But, public/preventative health measures save more lives than any other of the various medical fields. When I arrived here to start practice in 1972, there was no Public Health Department. Now, we have a state of the art, well planned building with a dedicated staff serving our community ( I recently had a Covid 19 test, and had results in  but from the state's control of some functions of our health department. We have excellent funds, but we are not always allowed to use them to the fullest extent because of state guidelines. This is changing some, and Mr. Jones is representing our needs very well. I want Pawhuskans to be proud of their Health Department -- it took a long time, and a lot of work, to have what we have.
 Another thought: Shouldn't we wear masks in public, to protect others from catching an unexpected Corona Virus infection from us? We wear clothes in public, as a (?) moral mandate. Shouldn't we wear masks at this time, as a health mandate?
 Sincerely,
 Michael L. Jordan, M.D.
